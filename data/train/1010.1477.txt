    "the interest in relativistic non - equilibrium thermodynamics has grown recently , mostly due to recent experiments as well as new ideas in theoretical modeling @xcite .",
    "most works dealing with applications of the theory do not refer to the corresponding system of transport equations including dissipation _ to first order in the gradients_. this is principally due to the fact that for decades such system has been thought to predict unphysical dynamics in the fluid @xcite .",
    "however , it was recently pointed out that when kinetic theory is used to formulate the constitutive equations that complete such set , instead of phenomenological arguments , the system of transport equations is free of instabilities and shows no causality issues in the linear regime @xcite .",
    "relativistic kinetic theory to first order in the gradients has been vastly explored by previous authors @xcite . in those works the purely relativistic term that appears in the closure for the heat flux",
    "is included in a generalized thermal force with one transport coefficient i.e. a relativistic thermal conductivity .",
    "however , the system of transport equations constitutes a set of five balance equations and needs to be eventually expressed in terms of only five state variables . in the usual representation , these variables are the number density @xmath0 , the hydrodynamic four velocity @xmath1 , which only has three independent components , and temperature @xmath2 . because of this , constitutive equations for the dissipative fluxes in terms of gradients of those quantities are required to close the system .",
    "the aim of this work is to show the highlights of the calculation of the heat flux from the complete boltzmann equation using the chapman - enskog approximation within the @xmath3 representation .",
    "the details and further analysis of this calculation can be found in ref . @xcite . in order to perform this task",
    "we consider the density and temperature gradients as independent forces and write two uncoupled integral equations .",
    "the coefficients involved in the constitutive relation are calculated and plotted for a constant cross section model . here",
    ", we also compare the results with those found in previous works using a bgk - like approximation @xcite . in order to make such comparison",
    ", we adjust the parameter included in marle s kernel by a relativistic factor arising from the structure of the kinetic equation .",
    "we further show that when this factor is taken into account , the deviation from the exact values are as significative as in the non - relativistic case .",
    "the rest of this work is organized as follows . in the second section some basic elements of relativistic kinetic theory are briefly reviewed including the chapman - enskog expansion for the solution of the boltzmann equation . in the third section an outline of the calculation of the heat flux using two independent forces is shown .",
    "the results for the transport coefficients are compared to the values obtained in the bgk approximation in section four and some final remarks and conclusions are included in the last section .",
    "in the kinetic theory of gases , the evolution of the distribution function of a a dilute gas is given by the boltzmann equation . if the temperature @xmath2 of such gas is high enough such that the relativistic parameter @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the rest mass of the particles , @xmath6 the speed of light and @xmath7 boltzmann s constant , is not negligible , the non - relativistic description is not appropriate .",
    "instead , relativistic kinetic theory ( rkt ) constitutes a more accurate framework . in rkt",
    "the fact that the speed of the molecules can be close to the speed of light is taken into account .",
    "the evolution of the distribution function is then given by the special relativistic boltzmann equation @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the molecular four - velocity , @xmath10 being lorentz factor , and @xmath11 is the collision kernel @xcite @xmath12\\mathcal{f}\\sigma\\left(\\omega\\right)d\\omega dv_{1}^{*}\\ ] ] in the previous equation @xmath13 the invariant flux and @xmath14 is the differential cross section @xcite .",
    "the system here considered is a dilute , single component , neutral , non - degenerate , inert gas .",
    "the local variables , number density @xmath0 , hydrodynamic four - velocity @xmath15 and internal energy density @xmath16 , are defined as @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 respectively .",

    "as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the heat flux can be calculated as the average of the chaotic kinetic energy , that is@xmath22 the chaotic velocity corresponds to the velocity measured in a local comoving frame .",
    "thus , one can replace the invariant @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : jutner ] ) by its value in the local comoving frame , that is @xmath24 . in this context",

    "this is because of the chosen representation in which @xmath0 and @xmath2 are considered independent state variables .",
    "thus , when the heat flux is calculated from the distribution function , the term proportional to the temperature gradient will lead us to a fourier - like law , while the term proportional to the density gradient is a purely relativistic contribution .",
