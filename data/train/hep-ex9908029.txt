    "cp violating phenomena arise in the standard model because of the single complex parameter in the quark mixing matrix.@xcite such phenomena are expected to occur widely in @xmath0 meson decays and are the incentive for most of the current @xmath0-physics initiatives in the world . as of yet there is little direct experimental evidence .",
    "s recent determination@xcite of @xmath37 at the @xmath38 level , which followed upon earlier less sensitive searches by both cdf@xcite and opal@xcite , is consistent with expectations for mixing - induced standard model cp violation and to date the only evidence of cp effects in @xmath0 mesons .",
    "direct cp violation however is also anticipated to play a prominent role in the cp phenomena of @xmath0 decay .",
    "to date the only published search for direct cp violation in @xmath0 decay is the recent cleo limit@xcite on  in @xmath39 .",
    "cp asymmetries may show up in any mode where there are two or more participating diagrams which differ in weak and strong phases .",
    "@xmath40 modes , for instance , involve @xmath41 tree diagrams carrying the weak phase @xmath42 and @xmath43 penguin diagrams carrying the weak phase @xmath44 . though the branching ratios are small , such cases are experimentally straightforward to search for .",
    "rate differences between @xmath45 and @xmath46 decays would be unambiguous signals of direct cp violation if seen .",
    "we report here five searches for direct cp violation in charmless hadronic @xmath0 decay modes , based on the full cleo ii and cleo ii.v datasets which together comprise 9.66 million @xmath47 events .",
    "the modes searched for are the three @xmath48 modes , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , the mode @xmath4 , and the vector - pseudoscalar mode @xmath5 . in all but the first case the flavor of the parent @xmath49 or @xmath50 quark",
    "is tagged simply by the sign of the high momentum charged hadron ; for @xmath51 one must further identify @xmath52 and @xmath53 .    in what follows",
    "we will refer when needed to the generic final state from @xmath49 and @xmath50 as @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively .",
    "the corresponding event yields of signal and background we will label as @xmath56 , @xmath57 , , and . we define the sign of with the following convention : @xmath58    the statistical precision one can achieve in a measurement of  depends on the signal yield @xmath59 , the cp - symmetric background @xmath60 , any correlation @xmath61 that might exist between the measurements of @xmath54 and , and of course on  itself : @xmath62 in most cases there is no chance of confusing @xmath54 and  so @xmath63 .",
    "however for @xmath64 and @xmath65 , a small degree of crossover is possible due to imperfect particle identification ; we find @xmath66 for this case .",
    "for @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 one has an easy rule of thumb , @xmath70 . for @xmath71",
    "this means one expects statistical precision in the neighborhood of @xmath72 .",
    "as will be discussed later , systematic errors are small , and consequently the precision in  measurements can be expected to be dominated by statistical errors for a long time to come . as can be seen in eq .",
    "[ eqn : acpstats ] the statistical error is in turn dominated by the leading @xmath73 coefficient which reminds us that the only path to better  measurements will be more data . improvements to analysis technique that reduce @xmath74 or @xmath61 have less impact .",
    "the existence of a cp violating rate asymmetry depends on having both two different cp nonconserving weak phases and two different cp conserving strong phases .",
    "the former may arise from either the standard model ckm matrix or from new physics , while the latter may arise from the absorptive part of a penguin diagram or from final state interaction effects .",
    "the difficulty of calculating strong interaction phases , particularly when long distance non - perturbative effects are involved , largely precludes reliable predictions . under well - defined model assumptions ,",
    "however , numerical estimates may be made and the dependence on both model parameters and ckm parameters can be probed .",
    "a recent and comprehensive review of cp asymmetries under the assumption of generalized factorization has been published by ali _ et al _ @xcite .",

    "the below - threshold sample is used for continuum background studies .",
    "the on - resonance sample contains 9.66  million @xmath91 pairs .",

    "in addition , the cleo ii.v data set , which has significantly improved particle identification and momentum resolution as compared with cleo ii , now dominates the data set .",
    "cleo ii and cleo ii.v are general purpose solenoidal magnet detectors , described in detail elsewhere  @xcite . in cleo ii , the momenta of charged particles are measured in a tracking system consisting of a 6-layer straw tube chamber , a 10-layer precision drift chamber , and a 51-layer main drift chamber , all operating inside a 1.5 t superconducting solenoid .",
    "the main drift chamber also provides a measurement of the specific ionization loss , @xmath92 , used for particle identification . for cleo ii.v",
    "the 6-layer straw tube chamber was replaced by a 3-layer , double - sided silicon vertex detector , and the gas in the main drift chamber was changed from an argon - ethane to a helium - propane mixture .",
    "photons are detected using 7800-crystal csi(tl ) electromagnetic calorimeter .",

    "charged particles are identified as kaons or pions using @xmath92 .",
    "electrons are rejected based on @xmath92 and the ratio of the track momentum to the associated shower energy in the csi calorimeter .",

    "we have studied the @xmath92  separation between kaons and pions for momenta @xmath102  gev@xmath103  in data using @xmath104 decays ; we find a separation of @xmath105 for cleo ii and @xmath106 for cleo ii.v .",

    "the resolution on @xmath121 is mode - dependent . for final states without photons",
    "the @xmath121 resolution for cleo ii.v(ii ) is @xmath122  mev .",
    "most other modes are only slightly worse but for the @xmath123 analysis , the @xmath121 resolution is worse by about a factor of two and becomes asymmetric because of energy loss out of the back of the csi crystals .",
