    "partial differential equations of diffusion type have long served to model regulatory feedbacks and pattern formation in aggregates of living cells .",
    "classical mathematical models of pattern formation in cell assemblies have been constructed using reaction - diffusion equations .",
    "they have been applied to describe pattern formation of animal coat markings , bacterial and cellular growth patterns , tumor growth and tissue development , see e.g. , @xcite and @xcite and references therein .",
    "one of the mechanisms of pattern formation in reaction - diffusion systems , prevalent in the modeling literature since the seminal paper of allan turing @xcite , is diffusion driven instability ( turing - type instability ) .",
    "diffusion - driven instability arises in a reaction - diffusion system , when there exists a spatially homogeneous solution , which is asymptotically stable in the sense of linearized stability in the space of constant functions , but it is unstable with respect to spatially inhomogeneous perturbation .",
    "the majority of theoretical studies in theory of pattern formation focus on the analysis of the systems of two or more reaction - diffusion equations . in many biological applications",
    "it is relevant to consider systems consisting of a single reaction - diffusion equation coupled with a system of ordinary differential equations .",
    "such models can also exhibit diffusion - driven instability .",
    "however , they are very different from classical turing - type models and the spatial structure of the pattern emerging from the destabilisation of the spatially homogeneous steady state can not be concluded from a linear stability analysis @xcite . the models exhibit qualitatively new patterns of behavior of solutions , including , in some cases , a strong dependence of the emerging pattern on initial conditions and quasi - stability followed by rapid growth of solutions @xcite .",
    "mathematical theory exists only for special cases of such solutions arising in the models , which can be simplified to the single reaction - diffusion equation with nonlocal terms and with fast growing kinetics .",
    "the example of such systems are gierer - meinhard and gray - scott models .",
    "the existence and stability of the solutions of such systems were intensively studied using singular perturbation analysis and spectral analysis of the eigenvalue problem associated with the linearization around the `` spike - like '' solution , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the structure of the kinetics involved in the cell proliferation model considered by us is different , in particular the autocatalysis is excluded by the biological assumptions and the solutions of our model are uniformly bounded .",
    "as shown in @xcite the models have stationary solutions of periodic type , the maxima and minima of which may be of the spike or plateau type .",
    "numerical simulations show that in some cases solutions of the model converge to a spatially heterogeneous pattern , which persists for an arbitrary long time while in other cases the transient growth of nonconstant pattern is observed and ultimately the solution converges to a stable spatially homogeneous state .",
    "in this paper we approach the issue of the stability of nonconstant stationary solutions and investigate linear stability of spatially heterogeneous solutions of the model of the reaction - diffusion equation coupled with two ordinary differential equations , which was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follow : in section [ modelsection ] the model is introduced and the results on existence , regularity and boundedness of the model solutions are presented . in section [ stationarysection ]",
    "existence of a spatially nonconstant steady state is shown .",
