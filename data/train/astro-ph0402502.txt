    "the field of numerical relativity has matured to a stage where it is possible to simulate realistic systems of astrophysical interest . in this paper , we examine the global effects of viscosity on differentially rotating , relativistic stars . viscosity can have significant effects on the stability of neutron stars .",
    "for example , it can drive a secular bar instability in rapidly rotating neutron stars , as shown in newtonian gravitation  @xcite and in general relativity  @xcite .",
    "viscosity can suppress the @xmath1-modes  @xcite and other gravitational - radiation driven instabilities , including the secular bar modes  @xcite .",
    "viscosity also destroys differential rotation , and this can cause significant changes in the structure and evolution of differentially rotating massive neutron stars .    differentially rotating neutron stars can support significantly more rest mass than their nonrotating or uniformly rotating counterparts , making `` hypermassive '' neutron stars possible  @xcite .",
    "such hypermassive neutron stars can form from the coalescence of neutron star binaries  @xcite or from rotating core collapse .",
    "the stabilization arising from differential rotation , although expected to last for many dynamical timescales , will ultimately be destroyed by magnetic braking and/or viscosity  @xcite .",
    "these processes drive the star to uniform rotation , which can not support the full mass of the hypermassive remnant .",
    "this process can lead to `` delayed '' catastrophic collapse to a black hole , possibly accompanied by some mass loss .",
    "such a delayed collapse might emit a delayed gravitational wave signal detectable by laser interferometers .",
    "moreover , the collapse , together with any residual gas in an ambient accretion disk , could be the origin of a gamma - ray burst ( grb ) .",
    "both magnetic fields and viscosity can destroy differential rotation in a rapidly rotating star  @xcite .",
    "simple estimates show that the magnetic braking ( alfvn ) timescale for a laminar field is much shorter than the timescale of molecular ( neutron ) viscosity in a typical massive neutron star .",
    "hence magnetic fields are expected to be the principal mechanism driving neutron stars toward rigid rotation .",
    "phase mixing arising from magnetic braking  @xcite , or other possible magnetohydrodynamic instabilities  @xcite might stir up turbulence .",
    "turbulent shear viscosity could then dominate the subsequent evolution . in this paper , we are primarily interested in identifying the global evolutionary consequences of shear viscosity in a relativistic star , independent of the detailed nature or origin of the viscosity .",
    "to explore the consequences of the loss of differential rotation in equilibrium stars , we study the secular evolution of differentially rotating relativistic stars in the presence of a shear viscosity . viscosity and magnetic fields",
    "have two things in common : ( 1 ) they both change the angular velocity profiles of a differentially rotating star , and ( 2 ) they both act on _ secular _ timescales , which can be many rotation periods .",
    "the latter inequality poses a severe challenge to numerical simulations using a hydrodynamic code .",
    "it is too taxing for a _ hydrodynamic _ code using an explicit differencing scheme to evolve a star for physical realistic secular timescales . to solve this problem",
    ", we artificially amplify the strength of viscosity so that the viscous timescale is short enough for numerical treatment .",
    "however , we keep the viscous timescale substantially longer than the dynamical timescale of the stars , so that the evolution of the star remains quasi - stationary .",
    "we then check the validity of our results by reducing the viscosity on successive runs and testing that the viscosity - induced physical behavior is unchanged ; rather , only the timescale changes and does so inversely with the strength of viscosity .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the expected scaling is presented in section  [ justification ]  @xcite .    to study viscous evolution",
    ", we need to perform long simulations in full general relativity . typically , we evolve the stars in axisymmetry .",
    "this allows us to follow the secular evolution of the stars with high resolution in a reasonable amount of time .",
    "viscosity can , however , drive nonaxisymmetric instabilities when a star is rapidly rotating . to test for such instabilities",
    ", we also perform lower - resolution , three - dimensional ( 3d ) simulations on the most rapidly rotating stars we consider .    for non - hypermassive neutron stars that are slowly and differentially rotating",
    ", we find that viscosity simply drives the whole star to rigid rotation .",
    "if the non - hypermassive neutron star is rapidly and differentially rotating , however , viscosity drives the inner core to rigid rotation and , at the same time , expels the material in the outer layers .",
    "the final system in this case consists of a rigidly - rotating core surrounded by a low - density , ambient disk in quasi - stationary equilibrium .",
    "our most interesting results concern the fate of hypermassive neutron stars .",
    "we numerically evolve four models with different masses and angular momenta .",
    "we find that in all cases , viscosity drives the cores to rigid rotation and transports angular momentum outwards into the envelope . as a result",
    ", the core contracts in a quasi - stationary manner , and the outer layers expand to form a differentially rotating torus .",
    "of the four models we have studied , the star with the highest mass collapses to a black hole , with about 20% of the rest mass leftover to form a massive accretion disk . on the contrary , the other three stars do not collapse to black holes , but form star + disk systems , similar to the final state of the rapidly rotating non - hypermassive neutron stars described above . as will be discussed in section  [ rad_cooling ]",
    ", viscosity generates heat so that the stars do not evolve adiabatically in general .",
    "the extra thermal pressure due to viscous heating helps to support the stars .",
    "we also consider the limit of rapid cooling , whereby the heat generated by viscosity is immediately removed from the stars .",
    "of the three stars which do not collapse to black holes in the no - cooling limit , we found that the one with the lowest angular momentum undergoes catastrophic collapse in the rapid - cooling limit .",
    "about 10% of the rest mass is leftover to form an accretion disk in this case . to test the validity of the axisymmetric results , we perform 3d simulations to check for any nonaxisymmetric instabilities .",
    "we do not find any unstable nonaxisymmetric modes and the 3d results agree with the axisymmetric results .",
    "our results suggest that viscous braking of differential rotation in a hypermassive neutron star can , but does not always , lead to catastrophic collapse .",
    "when catastrophic collapse does occur , the remnant is a black hole surrounded by a massive accretion disk .",
    "this outcome is very different from that of the collapse of an unstable , rigidly - rotating `` supramassive '' neutron star , in which the whole star collapses to a black hole , leaving only a tiny amount of material to form a disk  @xcite .",
    "many models for grbs require a massive disk around a rotating black hole to supply energy by neutrino processes  @xcite .",
    "our results suggest that viscous forces in a hypermassive star could lead to the formation of a massive disk around such a black hole .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section  [ setup ] , we derive the relativistic navier - stokes equations containing shear viscosity in a 3 + 1 form suitable for numerical integration , and describe how we evolve them in both axisymmetry and full 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "we then describe in section  iii several tests that we perform to check our code .",
    "we present the results of our simulations on five selected stars in section  iv . finally , we briefly summarize and discuss our conclusions in section  v.",

    "the relevant timescale is ( see @xcite ,  p.99 ) @xmath62 this is comparable to the viscous timescale @xmath63 discussed below .",
    "magnetic fields coupled to the matter will redistribute angular momentum .",
    "in fact , even an initially small magnetic field frozen into the matter will be wound up and can destroy differential rotation in the star on an alfvn timescale  @xcite : @xmath64    viscosity will also redistribute angular momentum on a viscous timescale @xmath65 .",

    "this viscosity acts on a timescale  @xcite @xmath66 where @xmath67 , and @xmath68 is the characteristic temperature .",
    "it is widely believed that , for cold neutron stars ( @xmath69 ) , the neutron fluid in the inner crust condenses into a superfluid of @xmath70 cooper pairs  @xcite , while in the interior , the neutrons could form a @xmath71 superfluid  @xcite ( although this is less certain ) , and the protons a @xmath70 superfluid . in the case of neutron superfluidity ,",
    "@xmath72 will vanish , and the dominant viscosity will be due to electron - electron scattering  @xcite @xmath73 electron and proton fluids are forced to move together in the mhd limit  @xcite .",
    "differences in velocity between the neutron and proton - electron fluids are damped fairly quickly by mutual friction  @xcite .",
    "viscosity can be used as a model for turbulence in certain situations .",
    "turbulence may occur in young neutron stars as a result of pure hydrodynamic effects or magnetic instabilities  @xcite .",
    "turbulence is often modeled by the `` @xmath9-disk '' law , in which a shear stress @xmath74 is added to the hydrodynamic equation ( see e.g.  @xcite , chap .",
    "14 ) . here",
    "@xmath9 is a nondimensional constant ( which should not be confused with the lapse function ) with values in the range @xmath75 .",
    "the viscosity in this model roughly corresponds to @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the velocity of turbulent cells relative to the mean fluid motion , @xmath78 is the size of the largest turbulent cell , and @xmath79 is the sound speed .",
    "the corresponding timescale is @xmath80 which is much shorter than all the other secular timescales .",
    "hence turbulent viscosity , if present , is likely to dominate the secular evolution of differentially rotating stars .",
    "thermal energy is radiated away primarily by neutrinos .",

    "11 ) . for cooler neutron stars ,",
    "the cooling is dominated by the modified urca process , and the star cools on a timescale @xmath83  s  @xcite .",
    "depending on the temperature and the nature of the viscosity , the cooling timescale may be greater than or less than the viscous timescale .",
    "if @xmath84 , then the heat generated by viscosity will build up inside the star .",
    "otherwise , it will be radiated away as quickly as it is generated .",
    "we study both limits in this paper .",
    "secular effects will in general take many rotation periods to significantly affect the structure or velocity profile of a differentially rotating star .",
    "this poses a challenge to the numerical treatment of these changes .",
    "because of the short courant timestep required for numerical stability , it would be computationally prohibitive to evolve a star for such a long time using an explicit finite differencing scheme . the use of a fully implicit scheme for the finite differencing can allow stable evolutions with larger @xmath85 .",
    "each timestep is , however , much more computationally expensive as it involves matrix inversion .",
    "moreover , no fully implicit routine for the coupled einstein field and relativistic hydrodynamic equations exists at present .",
    "the secular timescales are so much longer than the dynamical timescales that the star can be thought of as evolving quasi - statically .",
    "therefore , it might be possible to treat the secular evolution in the quasistatic approximation , as in typical stellar evolution ( henyey ) codes , by constructing a sequence of equilibrium configurations up to the moment that stable equilibrium can no longer be sustained .",
    "this approach has been used to study the viscous evolution of differentially rotating white dwarfs  @xcite .",
    "however , building the required equilibrium models in full general relativity is a nontrivial task",
    ". it would be particularly difficult to identify the meridional currents and core - halo bifurcation that often arise in rapidly rotating configurations .",
    "more significantly , it would not be possible to follow the evolution of the configuration with a quasistationary approach if a dynamical instability ( i.e. collapse ) is triggered during the secular evolution .",
    "instead , we use our relativistic hydrodynamic code and artificially amplify the strength of viscosity so that the viscous timescale is short enough to make numerical treatment tractable .",
    "however , we keep the viscous timescale sufficiently long that the hierarchy of timescales is maintained , and the secular evolution still proceeds in a quasi - stationary manner . the behavior of the real system can then be determined by rescaling the time variable to adjust the viscous timescale to its physical value .",
    "the characteristic viscous timescale is @xmath86 where @xmath87 is an averaged value of @xmath16 across the star .",
    "suppose we evolve the same star , once with @xmath88 and once with @xmath89 . if both @xmath90 and @xmath91 are large enough so that they do not compete with the dynamical timescale , but shorter than any other secular timescale ( see , e.g. section  [ timescales ] ) , then the configuration of the star with viscosity @xmath90 at time @xmath92 will be the same as the configuration of the star with viscosity @xmath91 at time @xmath93 . by varying @xmath65 over a wide range and corroborating this scaling , we are confident that the physical behavior we observe is real",
    ". we can then scale the result of numerical simulations to the appropriate strength of viscosity , provided that the physically relevant viscous timescale is much shorter than all the other secular timescales ( e.g. , @xmath94 , @xmath95 ) .    as discussed in the previous subsection ,",
    "turbulent viscosity is likely to dominate the secular evolution .",
    "we adopt the stress tensor as in eq .",
    "( [ tuv ] ) and specify the viscosity @xmath16 suitable for modeling turbulence .",

    "hence @xmath97 . for simplicity , we assume that @xmath98 is constant inside the star .",

    "we also find that the rest density contours remain nearly axisymmetric throughout the evolutions of both stars .",
    "these results indicate that both stars are stable against secular bar formation on the viscous timescale .",
    "we have simulated the evolution of rapidly rotating stars in full general relativity including , for the first time , shear viscosity .",
    "our findings indicate that the braking of differential rotation in hypermassive stars always leads to significant structural changes , and often to delayed gravitational collapse .",
    "the rest mass , angular momentum , and thermal energy all play a role in determining the final state .",
    "we performed axisymmetric numerical simulations of five models to study the influence of these parameters . in the presence of shear viscosity , the most hypermassive model which we studied ( star  i ) , collapses to a black hole whether we evolve by ignoring cooling , or by assuming rapid cooling of the thermal energy generated by viscosity",
    "however , the viscous transport of angular momentum to the outer layers of the star results in mass outflow and the formation of an appreciable disk .",
    "next , we considered three hypermassive models ( stars  ii , iii , and  iv ) with the same rest mass @xmath191 , but different values of the spin parameter @xmath332 .",
    "these models have smaller @xmath191 than star  i , and are therefore less prone to collapse .",

    "in contrast , stars  iii and  iv , which have @xmath334 and 1.1 , respectively , do not collapse even in the rapid - cooling limit .",
    "this is sensible because these models have a smaller rest mass than star  i , but larger angular momenta than star  ii .",
    "though the cores of stars  iii and  iv contract , they are prevented by centrifugal support from reaching the necessary compaction to become dynamically unstable . in both cases , we find low - density disks surrounding uniformly rotating cores",
    ". however , our simulations do not rule out the possibility that slow accretion of the disk material could eventually drive the uniformly rotating cores to collapse . disk formation also occurs for star  v , which is differentially rotating but non - hypermassive .",
    "since there exist stable , uniformly rotating models with the same rest mass , the braking of differential rotation in this case does not result in collapse .",
    "however , differentially rotating stars can support larger @xmath57 than uniformly rotating stars . in the case of star",
    "v , there does not exist a uniformly rotating star with the same ( high ) angular momentum and rest mass , so that mass shedding must take place as viscosity drives the star to uniform rotation . in the final state , we find a rigidly - rotating core surrounded by a low - density , disk .    since results obtained from our axisymmetric code are physically reliable only for models which are not subject to nonaxisymmetric instabilities , we evolved stars  i and  iv in 3d to check for such instabilities .",
    "previous studies in newtonian gravity have found that the secular , viscosity - driven bar instability in uniformly rotating stars should set in when @xmath335 @xcite . when general relativity is taken into account",
    ", the threshold value can be somewhat higher @xcite .",
    "thus , of all of our models , stars  i and  iv have the best chances of developing bars since they have the highest @xmath57 .",
    "we introduced an initial bar - shaped perturbation and ran these cases in the rapid - cooling limit .",
    "we found that , in both cases , the small initial perturbation decays and no bar is formed .",
    "this is somewhat surprising since @xmath57 is well above 0.14 in both of these cases .",
    "we plan to address this issue in a future report .    for the evolution of each of our five models , we find that a massive disk or torus forms in the final state .",
    "the disk typically carries @xmath336 of the rest mass of the initial configuration .",
    "viscosity transports angular momentum from the interior of the star to the more slowly rotating exterior .",
    "the exterior regions then expand to accommodate the additional centrifugal force , forming a low - density disk .",
    "the inner core becomes rigidly rotating and , in some cases , undergoes gravitational collapse .",
    "the disk , however , remains differentially rotating since viscosity acts much more slowly in low - density regions . for cases in which black holes are formed ,",

    "the estimates obtained in this way agree reasonably well with the results of our numerical simulations .",
    "particularly good agreement was found for the case of star  i with no cooling , for which we were able to extend the evolution some @xmath338 beyond the first appearance of an apparent horizon . the rest mass and angular momentum of the disk surrounding the rotating black hole",
    "could then be calculated directly and agreed well with the estimates .",
    "we expect that excision techniques will continue to be crucial in establishing the final fate of systems involving matter surrounding black holes .    in a recent paper , shibata @xcite numerically simulated collapses of marginally stable , supramassive stars .",
    "these supramassive models were constructed using polytropic equations of state with @xmath339 and rotate at the mass - shedding limit with @xmath340 .",
    "shibata found that the collapse of these stars results in kerr black holes and that no more than @xmath341 of the initial rest mass remains outside of the hole .",
    "this result is quite different from our finding that disks are usually present following collapse .",
    "however , the initial data for the two calculations are quite different , as well as our inclusion of viscosity",
    ". the analysis of @xcite takes uniformly rotating , unstable configurations as initial data and follows their dynamical evolution .",
    "our calculations begin with differentially rotating , stable configurations and follow both their secular ( viscous ) and dynamical evolution .",
    "viscosity drives our configurations to uniform rotation .",
    "we find that massive disks usually form as by - products of the formation of uniformly rotating cores .",
    "this is due primarily to the transport of angular momentum from the inner to the outer layers .",
    "in addition , all of our models have @xmath342 .",
    "( large angular momentum is required to generate a hypermassive neutron star in equilibrium . )",
    "since this range is higher than that considered in @xcite , our models more naturally produce disks @xcite .    all of the phenomena observed in our simulations follow from the braking of differential rotation in strongly relativistic stars .",
    "this may be accomplished by viscosity as shown here , but magnetic fields are likely to be more important .",

    ", short - duration grbs are thought to result from mergers of binary neutron stars or neutron star - black hole systems @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the grb may be powered by accretion from a massive torus or disk surrounding a rotating black hole .",
    "we have demonstrated that such disks are easily produced during the evolution of hypermassive neutron stars .",
    "the braking of differential rotation may also be important in neutron stars formed in core collapse supernovae .",
    "nascent neutron stars are probably characterized by significant differential rotation ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "conservation of angular momentum during the collapse is expected to result in a large value of @xmath57 .",
    "however , uniform rotation can only support small values of @xmath57 without shedding mass ( @xcite , chap .",
    "thus , nascent neutron stars from supernovae probably rotate differentially .",
    "if the induced differential rotation is strong enough , hypermassive neutron stars can form . their subsequent evolution and final fate then depends on the presence of viscosity or magnetic fields .",
    "such considerations may be important for long - duration grbs in the collapsar model @xcite . in this model , the grb",
    "is powered by accretion onto the central black hole formed through core collapse in a massive star .",

    "we consider this an important step toward future numerical explorations of secular effects in other contexts .",
    "in particular , we plan to incorporate mhd into our evolution code , as magnetic braking probably acts more quickly than viscosity to destroy differential rotation in many systems , like neutron stars or supermassive stars @xcite .",

    "the dissipation of rotational energy by viscosity heats the stars , but they may be cooled by radiation ( e.g. neutrino radiation ) .",
