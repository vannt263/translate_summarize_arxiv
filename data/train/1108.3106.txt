    "the standard 4d general relativity and its newtonian weak - field limit fail at describing the observed phenomenology when it is applied to cosmic structure on galactic and larger scales .",
    "to reconcile the theory with observations we need to assume that @xmath0 of the mass is seen only through its observational effect and that @xmath1 of the energy content of the universe is due to either to an arbitrary cosmological constant or to a not well defined dark energy fluid .",
    "the cosmological constant problem appears to be so serious as the dark matter problem .",
    "the einstein equations admit the presence of an arbitrary constant @xmath2 . since observations indicate @xmath3 , the dark energy fluid has negative pressure .",
    "current observations suggest @xmath4 at all probed epochs@xcite , so models more sophisticated than a simple @xmath2 could seem in principle unnecessary .    in a previous paper@xcite we developed a extended general relativistic formalism from which we obtained an effective 4d static and spherically symmetric metric which give us ordinary gravitational solutions on small ( planetary and astrophysical ) scales , but repulsive ( anti gravitational ) forces on very large ( cosmological ) scales with @xmath4 .",
    "our approach is an unified manner to describe dark energy , dark matter and ordinary matter in the framework of the induced matter theory@xcite . in this letter",
    "we extend our calculations to study the lower limit for the size of some galaxies ( the milky way , andromeda and messier 87 ) of interest .      in a previous work@xcite",
    "we have considered a 5d extension of general relativity such that the effective 4d gravitational dynamics has a vacuum dominated , @xmath4 , equation of state .",
    "the starting 5d ricci - flat metric @xmath5 , there considered is determined by the line element@xcite @xmath6-d\\psi^{2},\\ ] ] where @xmath7 $ ] is a dimensionless function , @xmath8 are the usual local spacetime spherical coordinates employed in general relativity and @xmath9 is the space - like extra dimension that following the approach of the induced matter theory , will be considered as non - compact .",
    "furthermore , the space - like coordinates @xmath9 and @xmath10 have length units , meanwhile @xmath11 and @xmath12 are angular coordinates , @xmath13 is a time - like coordinate and @xmath14 denotes the speed of light .",
    "we shall consider that @xmath15 is an arbitrary constant with length units and the constant parameter @xmath16 has units of @xmath17 .",
    "for a massive test particle outside of a spherically symmetric compact object in 5d with exterior metric given by ( [ a1 ] ) the 5d lagrangian can be written as @xmath18 - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(u^{\\psi}\\right)^2.\\ ] ] we shall take @xmath19 . since @xmath13 and @xmath12 are cyclic coordinates ,",
    "hence their associated constants of motion @xmath20 and @xmath21 , are @xmath22 using the constants of motion given by ( [ b2 ] ) and ( [ b3 ] ) , we can express the five - velocity condition as follows : @xmath23 after rearranging some terms and using the expression for @xmath24 , the equation ( [ b5 ] ) can be written as @xmath25 if we identify the energy @xmath26 as @xmath27 the effective 5d potential @xmath28 results to be @xmath29 \\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\psi_0}{\\psi}\\right)^{2}\\left[\\left(u^{\\psi}\\right)^2\\left(\\frac{2g\\zeta\\psi_0}{c^2 r}-\\frac{r^2}{\\psi_0 ^ 2}\\right)- \\left(\\frac{rc}{\\psi_0}\\right)^{2}\\right ] .",

    "when we take a foliation @xmath33 on ( [ a1 ] ) , we obtain the induced metric given by the 4d line element @xmath34,\\ ] ] which is known as the schwarzschild - de sitter metric . from the relativistic point of view",
    ", observers that are on @xmath31 move with @xmath32 .",
    "we assume that the induced matter on @xmath31 can be globally described by a 4d energy momentum tensor of a perfect fluid @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are respectively the energy density and pressure of the induced matter , such that @xmath38 which corresponds to a vacuum equation of state .",
    "we associate the energy density of induced matter @xmath39 to a mass density of a sphere of physical mass @xmath40 and radius @xmath41 . if we do that",
    ", it follows that @xmath42 and the radius @xmath41 of such a sphere are related by the expression @xmath43 , such that @xmath44 and there is only a single schwarzschild radius . in this case",
    "the schwarzschild radius is @xmath45 .",
    "when it is greater than the radius of the sphere of parameter @xmath16 , the compact object has properties very close to those of a black hole on distances @xmath46 .",
    "this condition holds when @xmath47 . for",
    "@xmath48 one obtains @xmath49 and there is not schwarzschild radius . when @xmath50 there are two schwarzschild radius , an interior @xmath51 and an exterior one @xmath52 , such that by definition @xmath53 .",
    "in this paper we shall focus in this last possibility which is relevant for astrophysical scales .",
    "we shall assume that we live on the 4d hypersurface @xmath54 , @xmath55 being @xmath56 the present day hubble constant .",
    "when one takes @xmath32 , the induced potential @xmath57 on the hypersurface @xmath58 is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the effective 4d physical mass .",
    "the confining force @xmath61 is perpendicular to the penta - velocities @xmath62 on all the hypersurface @xmath31 , so that the system is conservative on @xmath31 .",
    "hence @xmath63 can not be interpreted as a fifth force .",
    "the first two terms in the right hand side of ( [ b9 ] ) correspond to the classical potential , the third term is the usual relativistic contribution and the last term is a new contribution coming from the 5d metric solution ( [ a1 ] ) .",
    "the acceleration associated to the induced potential ( [ b9 ] ) reads @xmath64    the condition for circular motion of the test particle @xmath65 acquires the form @xmath66 by expressing the equation ( [ b6 ] ) as a function of the angular coordinate @xmath12 ( indeed assuming @xmath67 ) , we obtain , after make the derivative with respect to @xmath12 , the orbit equation on 4d @xmath68 this equation is almost the same that the one usually obtained in the 4d general theory of relativity for an exterior schwarzschild metric with the exception of the third term on the left hand side .",
    "this new term could be interpreted as a new contribution coming in this case from the extra coordinate .",
    "it is well known that galaxies are finite in size . however , from the gravitational point of view this fact can not be explained in a satisfactory manner . from the observational point of view",
    "it is considered that the limit of one galaxy is where the angular velocity of matter around the center is zero : @xmath69 . at this radius ,",
    "the squared momentum @xmath70 @xmath71 becomes zero .",
    "hence , we shall consider some examples of galaxies to determine their size once we know the masses of the bh which are in the center of each one of these galaxies .",
    "this radius will be that for which @xmath72 in eq .",
    "( [ p _ ] ) : @xmath73 however , this radius should be only a lower limit for the galactic size , because in our calculation we are neglecting the galactic mass outside the bh .    in in this letter , we shall deal with size of galaxies in the present day , so that we shall consider that @xmath74 is the present day hubble horizon .",
    "however , for very distant galaxies one should take into account the horizon of the galaxy at the moment of the signal emission .",
    "in this letter we are interested to study galaxies to estimate its size once we know the compact object [ or black hole ( bh ) ] which is in its center .",
    "this kind of galaxies has spiral arms which evolves on the plane perpendicular to the angular moment .",
    "the immediate case to be studied is our galaxy ( or milky way ) , which has in its center a bh of a mass @xmath75@xcite .",
    "it is agreed that the milky way is a barred spiral galaxy , with observations suggesting that it is a spiral galaxy .",
    "the stellar disk of the milky way galaxy is approximately @xmath76 in diameter , and is considered to be , on average , about @xmath77 thick .",
    "it is estimated to contain at least 200 billion stars and possibly up to @xmath78 billion stars , the exact figure depending on the number of very low - mass , or dwarf stars , which are hard to detect , especially more than @xmath79 from the sun , and so current estimates of the total number remain highly uncertain , though often speculated to be around @xmath80 billion . in the figure ( [ figura1 ] ) we plot the evolution of @xmath70 as a function of the galactic radius .",
    "it is obvious from the graphic that the lower limit of the radius of our galaxy is close to @xmath81 , in agreement with observations .",
    "the galactic halo extends outward , but is limited in size by the orbits of two milky way satellites , the large and the small magellanic clouds , whose distance is at about @xmath82 @xcite . in our model",
    "it corresponds with a galactic mass of @xmath83 , which is very close to the milky way mass .",
    "another case of interest is the andromeda galaxy .",
    "it is also known as messier 31 , * m31 * ( or * ngc 224 * ) .",
    "andromeda is the nearest spiral galaxy to the milky way .",
    "* m31 * was the second galaxy in which stellar dynamics revealed the presence of a supermassive black hole@xcite .",
    "axisymmetric dynamical models implied bh masses of @xmath84 .",
    "the smallest masses were given by disk models , and the largest were given by spherical models .",
    "hubble space telescope ( hst ) spectroscopy reveals a dark mass ( presumed black hole ) located at the center of this cluster with an estimated mass of @xmath85@xcite . in the figure ( [ figura2 ] )",
    "we show the evolution of @xmath70 for three different bh mass values ( @xmath86 with thick line , @xmath87 with thin line and @xmath88 with points ) , as a function of the minimum galactic radius . from the graphic",
    "we infer that the radius of andromeda is greater than @xmath89 for a bh mass greater than @xmath87 . since the observations agree with a minimum galactic radius close to @xmath90",
    ", we infer that the bh mass in the core of andromeda would have a mass close to @xmath91 .",
    "a very interesting example is the galaxy messier 87 ( or * m87 * ) . at the core",
    "is a supermassive bh with mass estimated in the range @xmath92@xcite .",
    "* m87 * forms the primary component of an active galactic nucleus that is a strong source of multiwavelength radiation , particularly radio waves .",
    "a jet of energetic plasma originates at the core and extends out at least 5000 ly@xcite . in the figure ( [ figura3 ] )",
    "it is shown that its bound radius @xmath93 is really bigger than other galaxies , @xmath93 being in the range @xmath94 .",
    "we have calculated the lower radius for three different galaxies ( the milky way , andromeda and messier 87 ) using the estimation for the bh masses in their core of these ones .",
    "our results agree very good with observations . in view of our calculations",
    "we conclude that the mass of the bh in the milky way should be close to @xmath95 for a minimum radius close to @xmath96 .",
    "moreover , taking into account that our galaxy is limited in size by the orbits of two milky way satellites ( whose distance is at about @xmath97 ) , we conclude that our galaxy mass should take a mass of at least @xmath83 .    in the case of andromeda , we conclude that the mass of the bh in its center should be close to @xmath98 in order to obtain a minimum galactic size close to @xmath99 .",
    "finally , for the range of masses @xmath92 , our calculations conclude that the bound radius @xmath93 , of messier 87 should be in the range @xmath100 .",
    "overall , we have shown how the here adopted theory of extended general relativity implies the existence of the radius @xmath101 for a given gravitational source . beyond this radius",
    "the gravitational force becomes repulsive .",
    "as discussed above for the three example cases , this radius is yet compatible with the observed size of the source .",
