    "the large scale structure of the universe was arisen from initial fluctuations through the nonlinear evolution of gravitational instability .",
    "gravitational interaction is of long range , and therefore , the evolution of cosmic clustering is not localized in physical space .",
    "the typical processes of cosmic clustering , such as collapsing and falling into potential wells , the fourier mode - mode coupling and the merging of pre - virialized dark halos , are generally _ non - local_. these processes lead to a correlation between the density perturbations at different positions , even if the perturbations at that positions initially are statistically uncorrelated . for instance , in the zeldovich approximation ( zeldovich 1970 ) , the density field @xmath3 at ( eulerian ) comoving position @xmath4 and time @xmath5 is determined by the initial perturbation at ( lagrangian ) comoving position , @xmath6 , plus a displacement @xmath7 : @xmath8 the displacement @xmath9 represents the effect of density perturbations on the trajectories of self - gravitating particles .",
    "the intersection of particle trajectories leads to a correlation between mass fields at different spatial positions .",
    "thus , the gravitational clustering is non - local even in weakly non - linear regime .",
    "on the other hand , spatial locality has been employed in the gaussianization technique for recovery of the primordial power spectrum ( narayanan & weinberg 1998 ) .",
    "underlying this algorithm is to assume that the relation between the evolved mass field and the initial density distribution is local , i.e. the high(low ) initial density pixels will be mapped into high(low ) density pixels of the evolved field ( narayanan & weinberg 1998 ) . obviously , the localized mapping is difficult in reconciling the initially gaussian field with the coherent non - linear structures , such as halos with scaling behavior .",
    "it has been argued that the locality assumption may be a poor approximation to the actual dynamics because of the non - locality of gravitational evolution ( monaco & efstathiou 2000 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the localized mapping is found to work well for reconstructing the initial mass field and power spectrum from transmitted flux of the ly@xmath10 absorption in qso spectra ( croft et al .",
    "1998 . ) these results , joint with the data of wmap , have been used to determine the cosmological parameters ( spergel et al 2003 ) .",
    "however , the dynamical origin of the locality assumption remains a problem .",
    "it is still unclear under which condition the localized mapping is a good approximation .",
    "this problem has been studied in weakly non - linear regime under the zeldovich approximation .",
    "the result showed that the cosmic gravitational clustering evolution is spatially quasi - localized in phase ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) space made by the dwt decomposition ( pando , feng & fang 2001 ) . in this approach",
    ", each perturbation mode corresponds to a cell in the @xmath0-@xmath1 space , ( @xmath0 to @xmath11 , @xmath1 to @xmath12 ) with @xmath13 , and the density perturbation of the mode @xmath14 is @xmath15 .",
    "they demonstrated that , in the zeldovich approximation , if the initial density perturbations in each cells are statistically uncorrelated , i.e. @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes for kronecker delta function , the evolved @xmath18 and @xmath19 will keep approximately spatially uncorrelated always , @xmath20 , which is just what we call spatial quasi - locality in the dynamics of cosmic clustering . the spatial quasi - locality implies a significant local mode - mode coupling ( different scales @xmath1 at the same position @xmath0 ) , but very weak non - local coupling between the modes ( different positions @xmath0 ) .",
    "the non - linear dynamical evolution is well developed along the direction of @xmath21-axis , rather than @xmath4-axis in the phase space .",
    "this quasi - locality has been justified in weak nonlinear samples such as the transmitted flux of qso ly@xmath10 absorption spectrum ( pando , feng & fang 2001 ) .",
    "it places the dynamical base of recovering initial power spectrum from corresponding weakly evolved field via a localized mapping in phase space ( feng & fang 2000 ) .",
    "this paper is to extend the concept of quasi - locality to fully nonlinear regime .",
    "we try to show that the quasi - locality of the cosmic clustering in phase space holds not only in the weak nonlinear regime , but also in nonlinear evolution .",
    "since the nonlinear cosmic density field can be expressed by the semianalytical halo model ( e.g. cooray & sheth 2002 , and references therein ) , our primary interest is to study whether the quasi - locality could be incorporated in the halo model .",
    "we will first analytically derive the quasi - locality from the halo model , and then make a numerical test using high resolution @xmath22-body simulation samples .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    " 2 presents the statistical criterion of the quasi - local evolution of a density clustering in the @xmath0-@xmath1 phase space . ",
    "3 shows that the density field evolution might be spatially quasi - localized in the phase space if the cosmic density field can be described by the halo model .",
    "numerical tests on these predictions with n - body simulation samples are made in  4 .",
    "finally , the conclusions and discussions will be given in  5 .",
    "in physical space ( @xmath4 ) , the mode is dirac delta function @xmath23 , and cosmic mass density field variable is @xmath24 , while in scale space ( @xmath21 ) , the mode is the fourier bases @xmath25 , and the field variable is @xmath26 , which is the fourier transform of @xmath24 . in hybrid",
    "@xmath0-@xmath1 phase space , one can use the complete and orthogonal bases of the discrete wavelet transform ( dwt ) as the mode function . the mass density field",
    "is then described by the dwt variables .    without loss of generality",
    ", we introduce the dwt variables by considering a density field @xmath24 in a cubic box of @xmath27 , @xmath28 and volume @xmath29 .",
    "we first divide the box into cells with volume @xmath30 , where @xmath31 . for a given @xmath32",
    ", there are @xmath33 cells labelled by @xmath34 , and @xmath35 . the cell @xmath36 occupies the spatial range @xmath37 , @xmath28 .",
    "accordingly , indexes @xmath38 and @xmath39 denote for , respectively , the scale and the position of the cells . in each dimension",
    ", we have @xmath40 and @xmath41 , i.e. @xmath42 , or the volume of all cells in the @xmath0-@xmath1 space is @xmath43 .",
    "each cell @xmath44 supports two compact functions : the scaling function @xmath45 and the wavelets @xmath46 ( daubechies 1992 , fang & thews , 1998 , fang & feng , 2000 ) .",
    "both @xmath45 and @xmath46 are localized in cell ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the scaling functions @xmath45 are orthogonormal with respect to index @xmath39 as @xmath48 the scaling function @xmath45 is a low pass filter at cell @xmath44 . the scaling function coefficient ( sfc ) of the density field is defined by @xmath49 which is proportional to the mean density in cell @xmath44 .",
    "the wavelets @xmath46 are orthogonormal with respect to both indexes @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xmath50 the wavelets @xmath51 form a complete and orthogonal base ( mode ) in the phase space .",
    "therefore , the density field can be described by the wavelet function coefficients ( wfcs ) defined as @xmath52 the wfcs @xmath53 are the dwt variables of the density field .",
    "the dwt variables @xmath53 is the fluctuation of the density field around scales @xmath54 , @xmath55 located at the cell @xmath39 with size @xmath56 . since the wavelet @xmath46 is a band pass filter , in each dimension , @xmath53 is a superposition of fluctuations filtered in the waveband @xmath57 , where @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "this decomposition of the fluctuation is optimized in sense that the size of cell @xmath60 is adaptively chosen to match with the perturbations at a given wavenumber .",
    "the dwt bases generally have vanishing moments , i.e. @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath64 is dependent on wavelet .",
    "for the wavelet daubechies @xmath65 , we have @xmath66 .",
    "thus , the fourier transform of wavelet @xmath67 has a compact support in the wavenumber space @xmath68 . from eq.(6 )",
    "we have @xmath69 for all @xmath47 , and thus , @xmath70 where the density contrast @xmath71/\\bar{\\rho}$ ] , @xmath72 is the mean density . since @xmath73 , we have also @xmath74",
    "because the set of wavelets is complete , @xmath53 give a complete description of the density field @xmath24 , i.e. one can reconstruct @xmath24 or @xmath75 in terms of variables @xmath53 as @xmath76      the initial density perturbation of the universe @xmath77 is believed to be a gaussian random field with correlation matrix of the fourier variables @xmath78 @xmath79 and all higher order cumulant moments of @xmath78 vanish . the function @xmath80 of eq.(10 )",
    "is the initial power spectrum .",
    "the kronecker delta function @xmath81 in eq.(10 ) indicates that the initial perturbation for each mode @xmath21 is independent , or localized in @xmath1-space .",
    "generally , if the initial fourier power spectrum , @xmath80 , is colored , i.e. @xmath1-dependent , the correlation matrix of variables other than the fourier mode will no longer be diagonal . for instance",
    ", correlation function in @xmath0-space will be @xmath82 , which is the fourier counterpart of @xmath80 .",
    "however , the correlation matrix of the dwt variables of a gaussian field is always diagonal or quasi - diagonal , regardless the fourier power spectrum @xmath83 is white or colored .",
    "that is , the correlation function of @xmath53 is localized with respect to @xmath44 as @xmath84 where @xmath85 in eq.(11 ) is the dwt power spectrum of the field .",
    "the reason of the diagonality of eq.(11 ) is as follows .",
    "first , the wfc @xmath53 is given by a linear superposition of the fourier modes @xmath86 in the waveband around @xmath87 ( @xmath28 ) , @xmath53 with different @xmath38 consist of the fourier modes @xmath86 in different @xmath21 bands .",
    "while for gaussian fields , the fourier modes in different wave bands are uncorrelated in general [ eq.(10 ) ] , and therefore , there might be no correlation between the dwt modes of @xmath38 and @xmath88 if @xmath89 .",
    "this yields the quasi - locality of @xmath90 .",
    "second , the phases of the fourier modes of gaussian field are independent and random . for a superposition of",
    "the random phased fourier modes @xmath86 in the band from @xmath21 to @xmath91 , the spatial correlation length can not be larger than that given by the uncertainty relation @xmath92 .",
    "moreover , the non - zero regions of two dwt modes @xmath93 and @xmath94 with @xmath95 have spatial distance @xmath96 .",
    "consequently , all off - diagonal elements @xmath95 vanish or are much smaller than diagonal elements , i.e. , @xmath97 thus , the correlation function of the dwt variables of a gaussian field is rapidly decaying when @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "the diagonal correlation function described by eq.(11 ) is a generic feature of a gaussian field in the dwt representation .",
    "it should be pointed out that the wfc correlation function eq.(11 ) is different from the ordinary two point correlation function @xmath100 .",
    "the former is the correlation between two modes in @xmath2 phase space , while the later is for two modes in @xmath0-space .",
    "explicitly , eq.(11 ) describes the correlation of perturbation modes in the waveband @xmath101 between positions @xmath39 and @xmath102 , and so , it is sensitive to the phases of modes .",
    "the ordinary two point correlation is not sensitive to the phase of perturbations . in the dwt analysis ,",
    "an analogue of the ordinary two point correlation function is defined by by the correlation between sfcs , i.e. @xmath103 . since the scaling function @xmath104 is a low - pass filter on scale @xmath38 and at position @xmath39 , the correlation function @xmath105 behaves in a similar way as @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is a filtered density field smoothed on the scale @xmath108 .",
    "however , as @xmath93 is a high - pass filter , the wfc covariance @xmath109 shows quite different statistical features from the sfc correlation , e.g. , it is always quasi - diagonal or even fully diagonal for a gaussian field .",
    "generally , it has been shown for many analytically calculable random fields that the sfc correlation is significantly off - diagonal , while the wfc correlation is _ exactly _ diagonal ( greiner , lip & carruthers , 1995 )    moreover , within a given volume in the @xmath0-@xmath1 space , such as @xmath110 , the number of the dwt modes @xmath111 is the same as that of the fourier modes @xmath21 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath112 can be expressed as a linear superposition of @xmath113 , and vice versa .",
    "equivalently , the fourier power spectrum can be replaced by the dwt power spectrum ( fang & feng , 2000 ) .",
    "if the evolution of the comic mass field is localized , the evolved density field @xmath75 at a given spatial point is determined only by the initial density distribution @xmath114 at the same point .",
    "as emphasized in  1 , this locality is inconsistent with the non - local behavior of gravitational clustering .",
    "however , the evolution of the comic mass field can be quasi - localized in sense that the correlation between the dwt variables of the evolved field is always spatial diagonal if the initial correlation function is diagonal , such as eq.(11 ) . for perturbation modes in a waveband @xmath101 ,",
    "the quasi - localized range is @xmath115 .",
    "a quasi - localized evolution means that the auto - correlation function of the dwt variables is always diagonal , or quasi - diagonal @xmath116 when @xmath117 , if it is diagonal initially .",
    "thus , one may place a statistical criterion for the quasi - locality as @xmath118 where @xmath119 this is a normalized correlation function of the dwt modes , i.e. @xmath120 .    the auto - correlation function of the dwt variables , @xmath121 , measures the correlations between the perturbation modes on scales @xmath122 and @xmath123 at two cells with a vector distance given by @xmath124 . in the case of @xmath125 , @xmath126 gives the correlation between fluctuations on scale @xmath127 and @xmath128 at the _ same _ physical area .",
    "therefore , if condition ( 13 ) holds for all redshifts , the dynamical evolution of the mass field is basically spatial localized in the dwt bases . comparing the condition eq.(13 ) with eq.(12 ) , we see that the cosmic field undergoing a local evolution is different from its gaussian predecessor by the factor @xmath90 , but not @xmath129 . in other words , the evolution leads to the significant scale - scale @xmath130 coupling , rather than modes at different locations @xmath117 .",
    "one can also construct the criterions for the quasi - locality using higher order correlations among the dwt variables @xmath53 .",
    "for instance , a @xmath131 order statistical criterion is given by @xmath132 where @xmath133 where @xmath134 and @xmath135 can be any even number .",
    "obviously , @xmath136 for gaussian fields .",
    "@xmath137 corresponds to a local scale - scale correlation , while @xmath138 a nonlocal scale - scale correlation .",
    "the quasi - local evolution of cosmic mass field requires that nonlocal scale - scale correlation is always small .",
    "it should be pointed out that the statistical conditions eqs.(13)-(16 ) are not trivial because the dwt basis does not subject to the central limit theorem .",
    "if a basis subjects to the central limit theorem , the corresponding variables will be gaussian even when the random field is highly non - gaussian . in this case ,",
    "eqs.(13 ) and ( 15 ) may be easily satisfied , but it does not imply that the evolution is localized , or quasi - localized . statistical measure",
    "subjected to the central limit theorem is unable to capture non - gaussian features of the evolution .",
    "we will show , in this section , that the statistical criterions of  2.3 are fulfilled if the cosmic mass field can be described by the halo model .",
    "the cosmic clustering is self - similar and hierarchical , as the dynamical equations of collisionless particles ( dark matter ) do not have preferred scales , and admits a self - similar solution as well as the initial density perturbations are gaussian and scale free .",
    "the halo model further assumes that all mass in a fully developed cosmic mass field is bound in halos on various scales ( neyman & scott 1952 , scherrer & bertschinger 1991 ) .",
    "thus , the cosmic mass field in non - linear regime is given by a superposition of the halos @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the density profiles of halo with mass @xmath141 at position @xmath142 , and @xmath143 is the density profile normalized by @xmath144 .",
    "there are several different versions of the halo density profiles , such as @xmath145^{\\beta}$ ] with @xmath146 ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 ) , and @xmath147 $ ] with @xmath148 ( moore et al .",
    "a common feature of the halo density profiles is self - similar , which implies that the indexes @xmath10 and @xmath149 should be mass - independent .",
    "the mass dependence is only given by @xmath150 , which characterizes the size of the @xmath141 halo .",
    "the details of the profiles are indifferent for the problem we try to study below .",
    "what is important for us is only that one can set a self - similar upper limit to the normalized halo density profile as @xmath151 where @xmath152 , @xmath153 is a constant and the index @xmath154 is mass - independent",
    ". the @xmath141-dependence of @xmath150 are not stronger than a power law as @xmath155 .",
    "the halo model also assumes that the halo - halo correlation function on scales larger than the size of halos is given by the two - point correlation functions of the linear gaussian field with a linear bias correction , or by the correlation functions of quasi - linear field .",
    "therefore , no assumption about higher order halo - halo correlations on large scales is needed .    in this model , the time - dependence of the field is mainly given by the mass function of halos , @xmath156 , which is the number density of the halos with mass @xmath157 at time @xmath5 . in the press & schechter formalism ( 1974 ) ,",
    "the mass function is determined by the power spectrum of the initial gaussian density perturbation . moreover , the self - similarity of the halo density profiles insure that eq.(18 ) holds for all time .",
    "the cosmic evolution only leads to the parameters on the r.h.s of eq.(18 ) to be time - dependent .      with eq.(17 )",
    ", the dwt variable of the cosmic mass field in the halo model is given by @xmath158 the auto - correlation function of the dwt variables is then @xmath159 where the first and second terms on the r.h.s .",
    "are usually called , respectively , 1- and 2-halo terms .",
    "they can be written in the explicit form , @xmath160 @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the number density of halos with mass @xmath157 , and @xmath163 is the halo - halo correlation function .",
    "we show now that the dwt correlation function @xmath121 is quasi - diagonal , or fast decaying with respect to the spatial distance @xmath164 .",
    "first , consider the 2-halo terms eq .",
    "according to the halo model , the two - point correlation function @xmath165 is determined by the linearly gaussian density field .",
    "in fact , as having been discussed in  2.2 , the dwt correlation function of a gaussian field is generally diagonal [ eq.(12 ) ] , regardless the fourier power spectrum is white or colored",
    ". therefore , the dwt correlation function @xmath121 contributed from the 2-halo term should be quasi - local .",
    "the dwt integral in the 2-halo term of eqs.(22 ) is not completely the same as eq.(12 ) , as the halo - halo correlation function in eq.(22 ) is @xmath166 , while in eq.(12 ) is @xmath167 . for halos with size",
    "less than the scale @xmath38 considered , the factor @xmath168 in correlation function @xmath169 is smaller than the size of the dwt mode , @xmath170 , and so , the factor @xmath171 can be ignored in comparison with the variable @xmath172 . moreover , by definition of the halo model , the correlation functions @xmath169 does not include the contributions from halos with sizes larger than @xmath173 .",
    "thus , the cases of @xmath174 can always be ignored .",
    "the 2-halo term essentially follows eq.(12 ) , and is always approximately diagonal with respect to spatial indexes @xmath39 and @xmath102 .    to analyze the 1-halo term eq.(21 ) , we use the following theorem of wavelets ( tewfik & kim , 1992 ) .",
    "because the dwt bases is self - similar , for any 1-d power law function @xmath175 , we have @xmath176 where @xmath177 is wavelet in 1-d space , and @xmath178 is a constant . therefore , while using wavelets with large enough @xmath64 [ eq.(5 ) ] , the integral eq.(23 ) is quickly decaying with the spatial distance @xmath179 .",
    "in other words , besides two nearest position of @xmath180 , there is no correlation between modes at different position @xmath181 .",
    "the 3-d integral @xmath182 in eq.(21 ) has the similar structure as eq.(23 ) . using the upper limit eq.(18 )",
    ", one can estimate the decaying of the integral @xmath183 with @xmath184 .",
    "when @xmath185 , we can expand the function @xmath186 in terms of @xmath187 .",
    "thus , applying eq.(23 ) term by term , we have the decaying behavior of @xmath188 at least as fast as @xmath189 .",
    "similarly , in the case of @xmath190 , one can expand the function @xmath186 by the factor @xmath191 .",
    "following from eq.(23 ) , the decaying behavior of @xmath188 is then decreasing with @xmath184 as @xmath192 .",
    "accordingly , the 1-halo term in the correlation between modes @xmath193 and @xmath194 will generally decay as @xmath195 or @xmath196 .",
    "the correlation function @xmath197 is then approximately diagonal w.r.t .",
    "the spatial index @xmath39 and @xmath102 .",
    "this result is largely valid due to @xmath150 varying with @xmath141 by a power law .",
    "proceeding in the similar way as above , we can also show the diagonality of the correlation function @xmath198 . in this case , instead of eq.(23 ) , we use the following theorem ( tewfik & kim , 1992 ) @xmath199 consider that the cell @xmath200 has the same physical position as cell @xmath201 if @xmath202 , the theorem eq.(24 ) also yields that the 1-halo term of the two modes @xmath47 and @xmath203 will decline with the physical distance between the two modes as @xmath204 or @xmath205 .    based on above discussions , one may draw the conclusion that if the halo model is a good approximation to the cosmic density field @xmath24 in the nonlinear regime at all time , their correlation matrix in the dwt representation remains quasi - diagonal forever , and the evolution is quasi - local .",
    "this result is based on the self - similarity of the density profiles of halos and the weakly nonlinear correlation between halos .",
    "the self - similar scaling ensures that the non - local correlation among the dwt variable is uniformly suppressed , independent of the mass of halos .",
    "mathematically , the correlations between the dwt modes of perturbations at different physical places are uniformly converging to zero with the increasing of @xmath64 if the index @xmath154 is mass - independent .      to show the quasi - locality of higher order statistical criterion",
    ", we use the hierarchical clustering or linked - pair relation ( peebles 1980 ) , which is found to be consistent with the halo model . for the 3@xmath206 order correlations ,",
    "the linked - pair relation is @xmath207,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the coefficient @xmath208 might be scale - dependent . subjecting eq.(25 ) to a dwt by 3@xmath206 order basis @xmath209",
    ", we have @xmath210.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath211 is given by the 3-wavelet integral , @xmath212 since @xmath46 is localized in the cell ( @xmath47 ) , @xmath213 is significant only if the three cells ( @xmath214 ) , ( @xmath215 ) and ( @xmath216 ) coincide with each other at the same physical area .",
    "thus , by virtue of the locality of correlations @xmath217 and @xmath218 (  3.2 ) , it is easy to see that @xmath219 is small if the cells ( @xmath214 ) , ( @xmath220 ) and ( @xmath221 ) are disjoint in the physical space .",
    "since @xmath208 does not depend on @xmath4 , the result of locality will keep valid when @xmath208 is scale - dependent ,    obviously , the 3@xmath222 order result can be generalized to @xmath223 order dwt correlation function .",
    "the integral of @xmath224 wavelets @xmath225 , @xmath226, ...",
    "@xmath227 is zero or very small otherwise the @xmath224 cells ( @xmath214 ) , ( @xmath220 ) ... ( @xmath228 ) coincide in the same physical area .",
    "in addition , all terms on the r.h.s .",
    "of the hierarchical clustering relation consist of linked 2@xmath222 dwt correlation function , the @xmath223 order dwt correlation function @xmath229 should be localized .",
    "thus , the criterion eq.(15 ) and other higher order criterions will be satisfied in general .    in summary ,",
    "if the cosmic density field is evolved self - similarly from an initially gaussian field , the spatial quasi - locality is true at all time , i.e.    * the second and higher order correlation functions of the dwt variables , @xmath53 of the evolved field is quasi - diagonal with respect to the position index @xmath39 .    for those type of fields , the possible non - gaussian features with the dwt variables are mainly    * non - gaussian one - point distribution of the dwt variables @xmath53 ; * local scale - scale correlation among the dwt variables .    above three points",
    "are the major theoretical results of this paper .",
    "to demonstrate the quasi - locality of the evolved cosmic density field , we use samples produced by jing & suto ( 2002 ) .",
    "the samples are given by high resolution n - body simulation , running with the vectorized - parallelized p@xmath230 m code .",
    "the cosmological model was taken to be lcdm model specified by parameters @xmath231 .",
    "the primordial density fluctuation is assumed to obey the gaussian statistics ( this is important for us ) , and the power spectrum is of the harrison - zeldovich type . the linear transfer function for the dark matter power spectrum is taken from bardeen et al ( 1986 ) .",
    "the simulation was performed in a periodic , cubical box of size 100h@xmath232mpc with a 1200@xmath230 grid points for the particle - mesh ( pm ) force computation , and 512@xmath230 particles .",
    "the short - range force is compensated for the pm force calculation at the separation less than @xmath233 , where @xmath234 is the mesh cell size .",
    "the simulations are evolved by 1200 time steps from the initial redshift @xmath235 .",
    "the force resolution is 20 h@xmath232 kpc for the linear density softening form .",
    "it is noted that our statistic tests are performed on scales @xmath236 h@xmath232 mpc .",
    "we have one realization . in the practical computations ,",
    "we divide the 100 h@xmath232 mpc simulation box into 8 subboxes each with size @xmath237 50h@xmath232 mpc .",
    "accordingly , the ensemble average and 1@xmath238 variance are obtained from those 8 subboxes .      before showing the quasi - locality ,",
    "we first calculate the correlation function of the sfcs , i.e. @xmath239 . as has been discussed in  2.2 , the correlation function @xmath239 is actually analogue to the ordinary two - point correlation function @xmath240 , where @xmath241 .",
    "since @xmath242 is a filtered density field smoothed by the scaling function on the scale @xmath38 , it is expected that the correlation function @xmath239 will display similar feature as @xmath240 .",
    "figure 1 presents the @xmath243-dependence of @xmath239 at @xmath244 , corresponding to the smoothed field filtered on the linear scale @xmath245 h@xmath232 mpc .",
    "the spatial distance between the cells @xmath39 and @xmath102 is @xmath246 h@xmath232 mpc . in this calculation , we applied wavelet daubechies 4 ( daubechies , 1992 ) .",
    "as expected , the @xmath243- or @xmath184-dependence of the correlation function @xmath239 shows the standard power law , @xmath247 with the index @xmath248 .",
    "that is , this correlation function is not localized .",
    "meanwhile in fig.1 , the contributions of the 1-halo and 2-halo terms are also plotted , respectively .",
    "the 1-halo term is calculated from eq.(21 ) with the nfw density profiles of halos , and the 2-halo term is given by eq.(22 ) in which the correlation function @xmath240 is given by the linear power spectrum .",
    "the nonlinear clustering is largely due to the 1-halo term .",
    "therefore , one can see that the nonlinear evolution of gravitational clustering cause correlations on scales of several mpc .",
    "we now study the quasi - locality of the clustering with the correlation function @xmath121 , which is used in the criterion @xmath249 [ eq.(13 ) ] .",
    "first , we take the same parameter as fig",
    ". 1 , @xmath250 , and @xmath251 h@xmath232 mpc , and also we used wavelet daubechies 4 ( daubechies , 1992 ) , which has @xmath252 .",
    "the result of dwt correlation function @xmath253 .",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "2 . the solid circle at @xmath254 in fig . 2 corresponds to @xmath255 , or @xmath256 , and other solid circles from left to right correspond , successively , to @xmath257 , 2 , 3 ...    from fig .",
    "2 , we can see immediately that the shape of the @xmath243- or @xmath258-dependence of @xmath253 is quite different from the `` standard '' power law .",
    "the correlation function @xmath253 is non - zero mainly at point @xmath254 or @xmath259 . at @xmath260 , the correlation function @xmath261 drops to tiny values around @xmath262 . for @xmath263 ,",
    "the correlation function basically is zero .",
    "the correlation length in terms of the position index @xmath39 is approximately zero , namely , the covariance @xmath253 is diagonal .",
    "this is the spatial quasi - locality . in fig .",
    "2 , we also plot the 1- and 2-halo terms , @xmath197 and @xmath264 .",
    "although 1-halo term is dominated by massive halos , the covariance @xmath197 is also perfectly quasi - localized because of the self - similarity of density profiles of massive halos .",
    "the 2-halo term is zero at @xmath254 , because , by definition , eq.(22 ) does not contain the contribution of autocorrelations of halos .",
    "figure 3 presents @xmath265 vs. @xmath243 , for @xmath266 , @xmath267 and @xmath268 . the physical distance",
    "@xmath243 is the same as fig .",
    "2 , given by @xmath269 h@xmath232 mpc . the solid circle at @xmath254 corresponds to @xmath270 , at which , by definition , we have the normalization @xmath271 . other points from small to large values of @xmath243 correspond to @xmath272 1,2 , .... successively .",
    "clearly , all @xmath273 for @xmath274 are less than @xmath275 , which is actually from the noises of sample .",
    "the result implies that for all calculable points of @xmath276 , the correlation is negligible , and satisfies the criterion eq.(13 ) .",
    "we also calculated @xmath265 for modes of @xmath277 , but @xmath278 .",
    "most of these cases shows @xmath279 if @xmath280 .",
    "only exception is for the cases of @xmath281 , and @xmath282 . as an example , fig .",
    "4 presents @xmath283 for modes @xmath284 , and @xmath285 .",
    "it shows that @xmath286 if @xmath287 .",
    "the non - zero value at @xmath288 is about 20% of that at @xmath289 .",
    "this result is consistent with the theorem ( 23 ) , which only requires the suppression for modes @xmath290 , but may not work for @xmath291 .",
    "it implies that the clustering may give rise to the correlations between nearest neighbor cells in phase space .",
    "however , the cell resolved by @xmath281 is a rectangle in the physical space , and the shortest edge is given by @xmath292 , the physics distance of @xmath293 is still less than whole size of the rectangle .",
    "thus , it could be concluded that the covariance @xmath253 is always quasi - diagonal in the sense that all members with @xmath39 and @xmath102 are almost zero if the distance @xmath243 between @xmath39 and @xmath102 is larger than the size of the cell @xmath294 considered . in fig .",
    "4 , we show also a result calculated with wavelets daubechies 6 ( d6 ) , for which @xmath295 .",
    "it yields about the same results as d4 .    for the correlation between modes",
    "@xmath44 and @xmath296 with @xmath89 , we use the criterion @xmath297 of eq.(14 ) . in this case",
    ", the physical distance between two cells is @xmath298 and @xmath299 h@xmath232 mpc .",
    "figure 5 plots @xmath249 vs. @xmath243 for modes @xmath300 , @xmath301 , and @xmath302 and 6 .",
    "all the values of @xmath249 in fig .",
    "5 are not larger than @xmath303 , and are much less than the diagonal terms @xmath304 , or @xmath305 . we found this result is generally true for all the cases of @xmath306 .",
    "that is , the second order correlation between two modes with different scales @xmath38 and @xmath88 are always negligible , regardless the indices @xmath39 and @xmath102 . in other words ,",
    "the covariance of the wfc variables @xmath121 generally are quasi - diagonal .    as for the high order statistics by criterion eqs.(15 ) and",
    "( 16 ) , we can cite some previous calculations of the non - local scale - scale correlation defined by @xmath307 which is the criterion eq.(15 ) with @xmath308 .",
    "it has been shown that either for the apm bright galaxy catalog ( loveday et al .",
    "1992 ) or mock samples of galaxy survey ( cole et al .",
    "1998 ) , the non - local scale - scale correlation always yields @xmath309 if @xmath310 ( feng , deng & fang 2000 ) .",
    "although this work was not for addressing the problem of the quasi - locality , the result did support the quasi - locality up to the 4@xmath311 order statistics .",
    "as discussed in  2.3 , it is necessary to show that the random variables @xmath53 are non - gaussian for evolved fields .",
    "the possible non - gaussian features with the dwt variables are ( 1 ) non - gaussian one - point distribution of @xmath53 , and ( 2 ) local scale - scale correlations (  3.3 ) .    in fig .",
    "6 , we plot the one - point distribution on scales @xmath312 and @xmath313 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 .",
    "it illustrates that the kurtosis of the one - point distribution is high .",
    "the pdf ( probability distribution function ) is approximately lognormal .",
    "the 4@xmath311 order local scale - scale correlation @xmath314 is plotted in fig .",
    "7 . it shows @xmath315 on small scales ( @xmath313 5 ,  6 and 7 ) , while random data gives @xmath316 on all scales .",
    "the evolved field is highly non - gaussian , although it is always quasi - localized .",
    "we showed that the cosmic clustering behavior is quasi - localized .",
    "if the field is viewed by the dwt modes in phase space , the nonlinear evolution will give rise to the coupling between modes on different scales but in the same physical area , and the coupling between modes at different position is weak .",
    "the quasi - local evolution means that , if the initial perturbations in a waveband @xmath57 and at different space range @xmath60 is uncorrelated , the evolved perturbations in this waveband at different space range @xmath60 will also be uncorrelated , or very weakly correlated . in this sense",
    ", the nonlinear evolution has memory of its initial spatial correlation in the phase space .",
    "this memory is essentially from the hierarchical and self - similar feature of the mass field evolution .",
    "the density profiles of massive halos obey the scaling law [ eq.(18 ) ] , and therefore , the contributions to the non - local correlation function from various halos are uniformly suppressed .",
    "it has been realized about ten years ago that some random fields generated by a self - similar hierarchical process generally shows locality of their auto - correlation function in the phase space , if the initial field is local , like a gaussian field ( ramanathan & zeitouni , 1991 ; tewfik & kim 1992 ; flandrin , 1992 ) .",
    "later , this result are found to be correct for various models of structure formations via hierarchical cascade stochastic processes ( greiner et al .",
    "1996 , greiner , eggers & lipa , 1998 ) .",
    "these studies implies that the local evolution and initial perturbation memory seems to be generic of self - similar hierarchical fields , regardless the details of the hierarchical process .",
    "it has been pointed out that models for realizing the self - similar hierarchical evolution of cosmic mass field , such as the fractal hierarchy clustering model ( soneira & peebles 1977 ) , the block model ( cole & kaiser 1988 ) , merging cell ( rodrigues & thomas 1996 ) , have the same mathematical structures as hierarchical cascade stochastic models applied in other fields ( pando et al 1998 , feng , pando & fang 2001 ) .",
    "obviously , the local evolution can be straightforward obtained in those models .",
    "the dwt analysis is effective to reveal the quasi - locality in phase space .",
    "such quasi - locality is hardly described by the fourier modes @xmath86 , as the information of spatial positions is stored in the phases of all fourier modes . moreover , the fourier amplitudes @xmath317 subject to the central limit theorem , and are insensitive to non - gaussianity .",
    "the wavelet basis , however does not subject to the central limit theorem ( pando & fang 1998 ) , which enable us to measure all the quasi - local features with the statistics of @xmath53 .",
    "the quasi - locality of the dwt correlation is essential for recovery of the primordial power spectrum using a localized mapping in phase space .",
    "such mapping has been developed in recovering the initial gaussian power spectrum from evolved field in the quasi - linear regime ( feng & fang 2000 ) . by virtue of the quasi - locality in fully developed fields",
    ", we would be able to generalize the method of localized mapping in phase space to highly non - linear regime .",
    "the quasi - local evolution may also provide the dynamical base for the lognormal model ( bi , 1993 ; bi & davidsen 1997 , jones 1999 ) .",
    "the basic assumption of the lognormal model is that the non - linear field can be approximately found from the corresponding linear gaussian field by a local exponential mapping .",
    "the local mapping is supported by the quasi - local evolution .",
    "we see from fig . 6",
    "that the pdf of evolved field is about lognormal .",
    "therefore , in the context of quasi - local evolution , a local ( exponential ) mapping from the linear gaussian field to a lognormal field might be a reasonable sketch of the nonlinear evolution of the cosmic density field .",
