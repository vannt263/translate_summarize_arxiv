    "numerical relativistic hydrodynamics ( rhd ) has experienced an important step forward in recent years when modern high  resolution shock  capturing ( hrsc ) techniques began to be applied to solve the equations of rhd in conservation form .",
    "prior to the advent of hrsc techniques the field was dominated for more than one decade by wilson ( 1979 ) s approach to relativistic hydrodynamics .",
    "this approach relies on the use of artificial viscosity in order to handle the discontinuities ( shocks , contact discontinuities , etc . ) that may appear in the flow numerically .",
    "however , techniques based on artificial viscosity are prone to severe numerical difficulties when simulating ultrarelativistic flows ( see , e.g. , centrella & wilson 1984 ) . using modern hrsc techniques instead ,",
    "these difficulties are overcome ( see , e.g. , donat et al .",
    "1998 ) allowing one to simulate challenging relativistic astrophysical phenomena like , e.g. , relativistic jets or gamma - ray bursts ( grb hereafter ) .    in astrophysical jets",
    "flow velocities as large as @xmath2 of the speed of light ( lorentz factors @xmath3 ) are required  according to the nowadays accepted standard model  to explain the apparent superluminal motion observed at parsec scales in many jets of extragalactic radio sources associated to active galactic nuclei .",
    "similar arguments applied to the galactic superluminal sources grs1915 + 105 ( mirabel & rodriguez 1994 ) and groj165540 ( tingay et al . 1995 ) allow one to infer intrinsic velocities of @xmath4 in the jets of these sources",
    ". further independent indication of highly relativistic speeds can be inferred from the intraday variability occurring in more than a quarter of all compact extragalactic radio sources ( krichbaum , quirrenbach & witzel 1992 ) . if the observed intraday radio variability is intrinsec and results from incoherent synchrotron radiation ( according to begelman , rees & sikora 1994 ) , the associated jets must have bulk lorentz factors in the range @xmath5 30  100 .    with exception of the remarkable work of van putten ( 1993 , 1996 ) , who used pseudo",
    "spectral techniques to solve the equations of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics , numerical simulations of relativistic jets started soon after the first multidimensional relativistic hrsc codes had been developed ( mart , mller & ibez 1994 , duncan & hughes 1994 , mart et al . 1995 ) . since then many different aspects of relativistic jets have been investigated ( see , e.g. , mart 1997 for a recent review ) .",
    "the morphology , dynamics and propagation properties of relativistic jets have been analysed in mart et al .",
    "komissarov & falle ( 1997 ) investigated the long  term evolution of relativistic jets .",
    "first simulations of superluminal sources combining relativistic hydrodynamics and synchrotron radiation transfer at parsec scales have been performed by gmez et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1997 ) and by mioduszewski , hughes & duncan ( 1997 ) and komissarov & falle ( 1997 ) . from their simulations these authors inferred that the observations of such sources can be explained in terms of travelling perturbations in steady relativistic jets .    in the last two years",
    "further progress was achieved by simulating relativistic jets in three spatial dimensions and by incorporating magnetic fields ( koide , nishikawa & mutel 1996 ; nishikawa et al .",
    "1997 ; koide 1997 ) .",
    "however , instead of using fluxes obtained by solving riemann problems at zone interfaces , koide and collaborators code rely on the addition of nonlinear dissipation terms to their lax ",
    "wendroff scheme to stabilise the code across discontinuities .",
    "this stabilisation method was originally proposed by davis ( 1984 ) , who applied it successfully to the equations of classical hydrodynamics .",
    "the method is robust and simple as no detailed characteristic information is needed .",
    "koide and collaborators did simulate the evolution of the jet only for a very brief period of time .",
    "this fact and the coarse grid zoning used in their simulations , however , prevented them from studying genuine 3d effects in relativistic jets in any detail . on the other hand , the relative smallness of the beam flow lorentz factor ( 4.56 , beam speed @xmath6 ) assumed in their simulations does not allow for a comparison with riemann - solver - based hrsc methods in the ultrarelativistic limit .",
    "an astrophysical phenomenon which also involves flows with velocities very close to the speed of light are gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) .",
    "although known observationally since over 30 years , their nature and their distance ( `` local '' or `` cosmological '' ) is still a matter of controversial debate ( fishman & meegan 1995 ; mzros 1995 ; piran 1997 ) . in order to explain the energies released in a grb various catastrophic collapse events",
    "have been proposed including neutron - star / neutron - star mergers ( pacyski 1986 ; goodman 1986 ; eichler 1989 ) , neutron - star / black - hole mergers ( mochkovitch 1993 ) collapsars ( woosley 1993 ) and hypernovae ( pacyski 1998 ) .",
    "these models all rely on a common engine , namely a stellar mass black hole which accretes several solar masses of matter from a disk ( formed during a merger or by a non - spherical collapse ) at a rate of @xmath7 ( popham , woosley & fryer 1998 ) .",
    "a fraction of the gravitational binding energy released by accretion is converted into neutrino and anti - neutrino pairs , which in turn annihilate into electron - positron pairs .",
    "this creates a pair fireball , which will also include baryons present in the environment surrounding the black hole .",
    "provided the baryon load of the fireball is not too large , the baryons are accelerated together with the e@xmath8e@xmath9 pairs to ultrarelativistic speeds with lorentz factors @xmath10 ( cavallo & rees 1978 ; piran , shemi & narayan 1993 ) .",
    "the bulk kinetic energy of the fireball then is thought to be converted into gamma - rays via cyclotron radiation and/or inverse compton processes ( see , e.g. , mszros 1995 ) .    in the following we describe the main features of a special relativistic 3d hydrodynamic code , which is based on explicit hrsc methods , and which is a considerably extended version of the special relativistic 2d hydrodynamic code developed by mart , mller & ibez ( 1994 ) and by mart et al .",
    "the code has been designed modularly which allows one to use different reconstruction algorithms and riemann solvers .",
    "as it is the final goal of our work to simulate relativistic jets and grbs in three spatial dimensions , the code has successfully been subjected to an intensive testing in the ultrarelativistic regime ( see section [ ctest ] ) . in particular , genesis has successfully passed the spherical shock reflection test ( simulated in 3d cartesian coordinates ) involving flow lorentz factors larger than 700 ( see  [ essr ] ) .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ eqs ]",
    ", we introduce the 3d equations of rhd in cartesian coordinates in differential and discretized forms .",
    "the latter have been implemented into our 3d rhd code genesis .",
    "detailed information about the structure and the main features of the code is given in section [ struc ] .",
    "several 1d , 2d and 3d relativistic test problems computed with genesis are described in section [ ctest ] .",
    "the performance of genesis on scalar and multi - processor computers is analysed in section [ cperf ] , and a realistic simulation of a 3d relativistic astrophysical jet is presented in section [ jet ] .",
    "a summary of the paper containing our main conclusions and a discussion of present and future applications of the code in different astrophysical areas can be found in section [ conc ] . in appendix",
    "a , we give the spectral decomposition of the three dimensional system of rhd equations with explicit expressions for the eigenvalues and the right- and left - eigenvectors .",
    "appendix  b contains the explicit formulae for the numerical viscosity for marquina s ( donat & marquina 1996 ) riemann solver , and appendix  c describes the explicit algorithm to recover the primitive variables form the conserved ones .",
    "the evolution of a relativistic perfect fluid is described by five conserved quantities : rest mass density , @xmath11 , momentum density , @xmath12 , and energy density , @xmath13 ( all of them measured in the laboratory frame and in natural units , i.e. , the speed of light @xmath14 ) , @xmath15 where the lorentz factor @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( the einstein summation convention is used here , and @xmath18 is the kronecker symbol ) .",

    "the relativistic euler equations form a system of conservation laws ( see , e.g. , font et al .",
    "1994 ) which can be written in cartesian coordinates as @xmath25 or , equivalently , as @xmath26 where the vector of unknowns @xmath27 ( i.e. , the conserved variables ) is given by @xmath28 and the fluxes are defined by @xmath29    the system [ f ] of partial differential equations is closed with an equation of state @xmath30 .",
    "anile ( 1989 ) has shown that system [ f ] is hyperbolic for causal equations of state , i.e. , for those where the local sound speed , @xmath31 , defined by @xmath32 satisfies @xmath33 .    the structure of the characteristic fields corresponding to the nonlinear system of conservation laws [ f ] has explicitly been derived in donat et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and is summarised in appendix  a.    in order to evolve system [ f ] numerically , one has to discretize the state vector @xmath27 within computational cells .",
    "the temporal evolution of the state vector is determined by the flux balance across the zone interfaces of each cell and the contribution of source terms . using a method of lines ( see , e.g. , leveque 1991 )",
    ", our discretization reads @xmath34 where latin subscripts @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 refer to the @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 coordinate direction , respectively .",
    "@xmath41 and @xmath42 are the mean values of the state and source vector ( if non zero ) in the corresponding three - dimensional cell , while @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the numerical fluxes at the respective cell interface . finally , @xmath46 is a short hand notation of the spatial operator in our method .    at this stage ,",
    "our system of conservation laws is a system of ordinary differential equations which can be integrated with a large number of algorithms .",
    "we have chosen a multistep runge ",
    "kutta ( rk ) method developed by shu & osher ( 1988 ) which can provide second ( rk2 ) and third ( rk3 ) order in time .",

    "the special relativistic multidimensional hydrodynamic code genesis described in detail in the following is a 3d extension of the 2d hrsc hydrodynamic code developed by some of the authors .",
    "the 2d code has been successfully used for the simulation of relativistic jets ( mart et al .",
    "1994 , 1995 , 1997 ; gmez et al .",
    "1995 , 1997 ) .",
    "the main structural features of mart et al.s code has been kept , but there are important changes in the computational part . besides the addition of the third spatial dimension , a large effort has been made to _",
    "minimise memory requirements _ and to _ optimise the performance _ of the code as well as to enhance its _",
    "portability_.    like its predecessor , genesis evolves the equations of rhd in conservation form using a finite volume approach in cartesian coordinates . in accordance with the method of lines , we split the discretization process in two parts .",
    "first , we only discretize the differential equations in space , i.e. the problem remains continuous in time .",
    "this leads to a system of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) in time [ rkec ] .",
    "the numerical fluxes between adjacent cells required for the time integration are obtained by solving the appropriate 1d riemann problems along the coordinate directions ( spatial sweeps ) .",
    "high - order spatial accuracy is achieved by applying a high - order interpolation procedure in space , while high - order accuracy in time is obtained by using high - order ode solvers .",
    "genesis integrates the 3d rhd equations on uniform grids in each spatial direction . in order to have a flexible code genesis",
    "is programmed to allow for different boundary conditions , spatial reconstruction algorithms , riemann solvers , ode solvers for the time integration and external forces .",
    "the user selects these options at the preprocessor level , which reduces the number of _",
    "if_clauses inside the nested 3d loops to a minimum , and thereby maximising the code s efficiency .    making the selection at the preprocessing stage has allowed us to obtain a code , which is independent of a specific ( shared memory ) machine architecture .",
    "hence , it runs on different types of machines and processors . up to now , we have tested genesis on sgi platforms ( indy workstations , power challenge and cray - origin 2000 arrays ) , on hp machines ( 712 workstations and j280 computers ) , and on a cray - jedi multiprocessor system . as a next step",
    "we plan to port genesis on a cray - t3e massively parallel computer .",
    "the flow diagram of genesis is shown in figure [ flowdiag ] .",
    "details of the major components of genesis are discussed in the following subsections .",
    "the current version of genesis , which is written in fortran  90 has the capability of allocating memory _",
    "dynamically _ ,",
    "i.e. the number of computational cells can be chosen at run time .",
    "reducing the ram requirements of a 3d hydrodynamic code is obviously crucial . in genesis",
    "multidimensional variables are responsible for about @xmath55 of the code s memory requirement .",
    "thus , the number of these 3d arrays has to be kept at the absolute minimum possible . in its present version ,",
    "genesis only requires three sets of five 3d arrays each , consisting of one set of conserved variables at the begining of each time level ( @xmath56 ) , another set of primitive variables and a third set of scratch variables ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the time integration scheme ( eqs .",
    "[ rka][rkb ] ) which results in the updated values of the conserved variables at the next time level ( @xmath58 ) then reads :    1 .",
    "prediction step ( common for rk2 and rk3 ) : @xmath59 2 .",
    "depending on the order of accuracy of the time integration scheme do : * @xmath60 + with @xmath50 and @xmath51 , or * @xmath61 + with @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "quantities like entropy , internal energy , sound speed or lorentz factor are implemented as fortran scalars .",
    "consequently , genesis needs about 1 gbyte of ram memory to handle a grid of @xmath62 ( in double precision ) .",
    "the technique of domain decomposition is used to optimise the parallelization of the code and to guarantee its performance in real applications , too .",
    "it is also the first step towards the development of a parallel version of genesis which runs efficiently on parallel computers with distributed memory .",
    "the physical domain is split along _",
    "one _ arbitrary spatial direction ( z , in the present version ) in a set of subdomains ( i.e. _ slices _ , see fig .",
    "[ domdec]a ) of similar computational load .",
    "the subdomains are then distributed across processors .",
    "numerical fluxes at subdomain boundaries are calculated by providing the appropriate internal and external boundary conditions ( see fig .",
    "[ domdec]b , c , respectively , and   [ bound ] ) .",
    "the computational grid is extended in each coordinate in positive and negative direction by four so - called _ ghost _ zones , which provide a convenient way to implement different types of boundary conditions .",
    "these boundary conditions have to be provided in each spatial sweep for all primitive variables . in genesis",
    "several types of boundary conditions are available including reflecting , inflow , outflow , time - dependent and analytically prescribed boundary conditions .",
    "flow conditions at subdomain boundaries must be provided , too , in order to calculate numerical fluxes at subdomain interfaces .",
    "hence , subdomains are also enlarged by four ghost zones in each coordinate direction .",
    "note that these ghost zones do overlap with adjacent subdomains ( see fig .",
    "[ domdec ] ) .",
    "the internal boundary conditions in these overlapping regions are defined by copying the corresponding values of the respective adjacent subdomain . for @xmath63 subdomains and @xmath64 computational zones",
    "the number of overlapping cells is @xmath65 , i.e. the fraction of overlapping cells is @xmath66 .",
    "hence , for @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( typical of a jet simulation ) the fraction of overlapping cells is about 12% .      in order to improve the spatial accuracy of the code , we interpolate the values of the pressure , the proper rest  mass density and the spatial components of the four  velocity ( @xmath69 ) within computational cells . these reconstructed variables are afterwards used to compute the numerical fluxes . because of the monotonicity of the reconstruction procedures ( see below ) used in genesis , the occurrence of unphysical ( i.e. , negative ) values in the reconstructed profiles of pressure and density are avoided .",
    "in addition , reconstructing the spatial components of the four - velocity with monotonic schemes , also prevents the occurrence of unphysical values of the flow velocity , i.e. , the flow velocity always remains smaller than the speed of light even in multidimensional calculations .",
    "genesis provides , at the preprocessing level , four different types of reconstruction schemes : piecewise constant , linear using the minmod function of van leer ( 1979 ) , parabolic using the piecewise parabolic method , ppm , of colella & woodward ( 1984 ; see also mart & mller 1996 ) or hyperbolic using the piecewise hyperbolic method , phm , of marquina ( 1994 ) .",
    "gravity , local radiative processes , etc . , are coupled with hydrodynamics through terms on the right hand side of the rhd equations ( i.e. , via the source terms , @xmath70 , in eq .",
    "[ rkec ] ) .",
    "genesis integrates such terms assuming piecewise constant profiles for the source functions .      in this paper",
    "we use a variant of marquina s flux formula ( see donat & marquina 1996 ) which has already been shown to work properly in the simulation of relativistic jets in 2d ( mart et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the approach followed by donat & marquina ( 1996 ) relies on the extension of the entropy  satisfying scalar numerical flux of shu & osher ( 1989 ) to hyperbolic systems of conservation laws .",
    "given the spectral decomposition of the rhd equations ( see appendix  a ) , the implementation of marquina s scheme is straightforward .",
    "the original marquina s algorithm computes the contribution to the numerical viscosity of each characteristic field in a different way depending on whether the corresponding eigenvalue ( characteristic speed ) does change its sign between the left and right states or whether it does not .",
    "however , instead of using the original algorithm , we only consider that part which corresponds to characteristic speeds changing their signs between the left and right states of every numerical interface .",
    "the modified algorithm has a larger numerical viscosity , but it is more stable and does not involve any _ if_-clause .",
    "hence , it can easily be vectorized .    in the 2d version used in mart et al .",
    "( 1997 ) the left eigenvectors of the jacobians are calculated numerically by inverting the matrix of right eigenvectors . in genesis",
    "we use the analytical expressions for the left eigenvectors , which allow one to simplify the computation of the numerical viscosity terms .",
    "the explicit expressions for the numerical fluxes ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 in eq .",
    "[ rkec ] ) as a function of the local ( reconstructed ) primitive and conserved variables are given in appendix  b. besides its influence on the efficiency of the code , the use of explicit expressions for the left eigenvectors also leads to analytical cancellations in the computation of the numerical viscosity causing a damping of the growth of round - off errors and an improvement of the overall accuracy of the code .",
    "previous versions of genesis , in which numerical fluxes were calculated without the use of analytical expressions , suffered from a growth of round - off errors due to the large number of operations involved and due to the finite precision of floating point arithmetics .",
    "this growth of errors manifests itself in a gradual loss of symmetry in initially perfectly symmetric problems .",
    "our experience shows that the analytical manipulation of the expressions of the numerical flux together with their appropriate symmetrization ( i.e. , using commutating formulas for the components of the velocity parallel to cell interfaces ) allows one to achieve a perfect numerical symmetry ( see  [ symmetry ] and  [ rssr ] ) .",
    "time integration is carried out by two different total variation diminishing rk methods developed in shu & osher ( 1988 ) .",
    "the user can choose , at preprocessing level , between the rk2 and rk3 algorithm ( see eqs .",
    "[ rka][rkb ] ) .",
    "results of similar quality can be obtained either with the rk3 algorithm or with rk2 using smaller time steps .",
    "nevertheless , for a given time step , the computational cost of rk3 is about a factor 1.5 larger than that of rk2 .    as in any explicit hydrodynamic code ,",
    "time steps are limited for stability reasons by the courant - friedrichs - levy ( cfl ) condition , which is computed using the characteristic speeds . at the end of each time",
    "step the size of the new time step is determined as the minimum of the time steps of all subdomains .",
    "this requires a global operation across all subdomains .",
    "experience has shown that acceptable cfl numbers lie in the interval @xmath73 $ ] .",
    "cfl numbers larger than @xmath74 can lead to post shock oscillations .",
    "the solution of the riemann problem requires knowledge of the value of the pressure and its thermodynamic derivatives .",
    "given the functional dependence between conserved and primitive variables ( see eq .",
    "[ s ] ) , the recovering procedure can not be formulated in closed form .",
    "instead a kind of iterative method must be used , which is very time consuming .",
    "hence , usage of the recovering procedure should be reduced to the absolute minimum .",
    "therefore , primitive variables are consistently updated from the mean values of the conserved variables after each runge - kutta step and their values are stored in a set of 3d arrays .",
    "our approach is the same as that of mart , ibez & miralles ( 1991 ) and that of mart et al .",
    "its explicit form can be found in appendix  c ( see also mart & mller 1996 ) .",
    "the iterative recovering procedure is based on a second order accurate newton - raphson method to solve an implicit equation for the pressure .    in zones where the flow conditions change",
    "smoothly the typical number of iterations ranges from 1 to 3 when a relative accuracy of @xmath75 is requested .",
    "there exist zones , however , inside shocks or near strong gradients , where the number of iterations required is larger depending on the strength of the shock or the steepness of the gradient .",
    "for example , in the shock reflection test in 3d , the shock zone needs about 4 to 8 iterations .",
    "we have taken special care in designing a numerical code that accurately preserves any symmetries present in the initial data .",
    "this is an important point for a code aimed to study , for example , the stability and long term evolution of initially axisymmetric jets .",
    "there exist two potential sources of numerical _ asymmetries _ in our code , both of them are related to the fact that floating point arithmetics is not associative .",
    "one cause of asymmetries is due to the computation of numerical fluxes in spatial sweeps , which violates what we call henceforth _ sweep  level symmetry _ ( sls ) . in order to guarantee sls",
    "the expressions by which the numerical fluxes are evaluated have been symmetrized ( see  [ ars ] ) .",
    "a second source of ( numerically caused ) asymmetry arises specifically in 3d codes using directional splitting .",
    "it can only be avoided , if the code has a property which we call _ sweep  coherence symmetry _",
    "it refers to the symmetry of the integration algorithm with respect to the order in which the 1d - sweeps are performed .",
    "this symmetry property of the algorithm becomes crucial if an initially spherically symmetric state is considered .",
    "we found that its initial symmetry is lost unless special care is taken in the calculation of the lorentz factor ( in the numerical flux routine ) , which involves the summation of the squares of the three velocity components . to guarantee a perfect sweep  coherence symmetry of the algorithm the addition of the vector components has to be performed in a cyclic manner , i.e. in the x  sweep the components are summed up in @xmath76 order , in the y  sweep in @xmath77 order , and finally in the z  sweep in @xmath78 order .",
    "due to the stochastic nature of round - off errors , a violation of the sweep  coherence symmetry manifests itself only in the last few significant digits of the state variables , if the number of time steps is not too large ( less than about 3000 ; see section  [ essr ] ) .",
    "given that round  off errors grow sufficiently slow and that they do not interact with the truncation errors due to the finite difference scheme ( which can render the scheme _ unstable _ ) , genesis does keep the symmetry of an initial state at an acceptable level .",
    "we have also tried to develop a version of genesis with a perfect 3d symmetry ( limited by the cartesian discretization ) . for this purpose",
    ", we applied the _ extended partial precision _ technique in the computation of expressions in which the associative property should be satisfied .",
    "the procedure was successful , but increased the total computational costs by more than 30@xmath79 .",
    "all the results presented in the following have been obtained without making use of such a technique .",
    "the capabilities of genesis to solve problems in special relativistic hydrodynamics are checked by means of three tests calculations that involve strong shocks and a wide range of flow lorentz factors . in these test",
    "runs an ideal gas equation of state with an adiabatic exponent @xmath80 has been used .",
    "all results presented in this section have been obtained with the ppm reconstruction procedure and the relativistic riemann solver based on marquina s flux formula ( see previous section for details ) .      in the first test",
    "we consider the time evolution of an initial discontinuous state of a fluid at rest .",
    "the initial state is given by @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , where the subscript @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) denotes the state to the left ( right ) of the initial discontinuity .",
    "this test problem has been considered by several authors in the past ( in 1d by hawley , smarr & wilson 1984 , schneider et al .",
    "1993 , mart & mller 1996 , wen , panaitescu & laguna 1997 ; in 2d by mart et al . 1997 ) .",
    "it involves the formation of an intermediate state bounded by a shock wave propagating to the right and a transonic rarefaction propagating to the left .",
    "the fluid in the intermediate state moves at a mildly relativistic speed ( @xmath91 ) to the right .",
    "flow particles accumulate in a dense shell behind the shock wave compressing the fluid by a factor of 5 and heating it up to values of the internal energy much larger than the rest - mass energy .",
    "hence , the fluid is extremely relativistic from a thermodynamical point of view , but only mildly relativistic dynamically .    to change this",
    "intrinsically one dimensional test problem into a multidimensional one we have rotated the initial discontinuity ( normal to the x - axis ) by an angle of @xmath92 around the y - axis , and then again by an angle of @xmath92 around the z - axis .",
    "gas states @xmath89 and @xmath90 are placed within a cube of major diagonal equal to 1 that constitutes the 3d numerical grid .    the analytical solution to this test problem",
    "can be found in mart & mller ( 1994 ) .",
    "our analysis is restricted to the flow conditions along the major diagonal of the numerical grid , which is normal to the initial discontinuity .",
    "figure [ fig_gsch ] shows the solution along the major diagonal at time @xmath93 .",
    "the shock is captured in two to three zones in accordance with the capabilities of hrsc methods .",
    "the transonic rarefaction has a smooth profile across the sonic point located at @xmath94 , and exhibits sharp corners .",
    "the contact discontinuity is spread out over roughly three zones .",
    "the absolute global errors ( in @xmath95 norm given by @xmath96 , where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the numerical and exact solution , respectively ) of pressure , density and velocity are given in table [ tab_err1.schn ] for different grid resolutions at @xmath93 . table [ tab_err1.schn ] implies a convergence rate of slightly less than 1 when comparing the errors obtained on the coarsest ( @xmath99 ) and the largest ( @xmath100 ) grid .",
    "this behaviour is expected for multidimensional problems involving discontinuities ( see , e.g. leveque 1991 ) .",
    "this 1d test problem involves the propagation of a strong shock wave generated when two cold gases , moving at relativistic speeds in opposite directions , collide .",
    "the problem has been considered as a test for almost any new relativistic hydrodynamic code ( centrella & wilson 1984 ; hawley , smarr & wilson 1984 ; mart & mller 1994 ; eulderink & mellema 1994 ; falle & komissarov 1996 ) .",
    "after the collision of the two gases , two shock waves are created in the plane of symmetry of the physical domain propagating in opposite directions .",
    "the inflowing gas is heated in the shocks and comes to a rest .",

    "the latter value corresponds to a lorentz factor @xmath116 .",
    "the relative error of the primitive variables shows a weak dependence on the inflow velocity .",
    "it never exceeds @xmath117 and for @xmath118 it is smaller than @xmath119 .    the ppm parameters ( see colella & woodward 1984 ) have been tuned to minimize the number of zones within the shock without introducing unacceptable numerical post  shock oscillations .",

    "the shock capturing properties of genesis , which we have already demonstrated in 1d , are retained in this genuine multidimensional case .",
    "two or three zones are required to handle the shock wave .",
    "the pressure and proper rest ",
    "mass density have global relative errors of about @xmath124 and @xmath125 respectively .",

    "the relative global errors are acceptable ( considering the inherent difficulty of the test and the resolution of the experiments ) and do not grow dramatically with the lorentz factor .",
    "the observed growth can be explained by the fact that the errors are dominated by the shock region and that the shock strength increases with the lorentz factor .",
    "the cfl factors used in the last two tests of this series are unusually small ( @xmath131 and @xmath132 ) which is due to the strength of the shock and the relatively small grid resolution ( compared with the 1d case ) .",
    "it is noticeable that for @xmath133 the errors are considerably larger ( last entry in table [ tab_err2.essr ] ) .",
    "this has two reasons .",
    "firstly , the global relative errors decrease with time in the rssr test problem .",
    "secondly , we could not continue the run with @xmath134 beyond 1.5 time units , because interaction with the grid boundaries became severe causing the code to crash .",
    "hence , @xmath134 must be considered as the maximum inflow velocity in the rssr test problem , which the present code can handle properly ( for the resolution used ) .",
    "the symmetry properties of the rssr solution are very well maintained by genesis , even though the number of timesteps was very large ( @xmath135 ) in the last two test runs .",
    "the absolute global errors ( @xmath95 norm ) and the convergence rates of the primitive variables at @xmath108 are displayed in table [ tab_err1.essr ] .",
    "obviously , the errors are much larger in the 3d test than in the corresponding 1d one .",
    "this can be explained considering that ( i ) the grids are coarser than in 1d , and that ( ii ) the jumps in pressure and density across the shock are nearly a factor of 30 larger in the 3d test than in the planar case .",
    "the preservation of the sweep - level symmetry ( sls ; see section ",
    "[ symmetry ] ) is reflected in the symmetry of the one dimensional profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig_essr ] . moreover , a comparison of the profiles in x and y direction in fig .",
    "[ fig_essr ] shows the capability of the code to maintain the sweep - coherence symmetry ( scs ) , too .",
    "we have parallelized genesis in order to run on multiprocessor computers with shared memory .",
    "appart from the initial setup of variables , the grid generation and the output , the rest of the program is organised in a 4-level nested loop .",
    "the outermost loop runs from one to the total number of sub - domains , assigning one sub - domain to each processor .",
    "this procedure allows an almost complete parallelization of the code employing the corresponding parallelization directives ( see fig .",

    "the mrrp and rssr tests have been run for different grids on a sgi cray - origin 2000 computer .",
    "tables [ tab_perf.gsch ] and [ tab_perf.essr ] show the total execution time for every run as a function of the number of cpus used .",
    "we also give the _ speed up _ factor , defined as the cpu ratio between a one processor run and one using several processors in parallel .",
    "this factor is a measure of the degree of parallelization of the code and should ideally be equal to the number of cpus used .",
    "the tables also contain the execution time per cell and time iteration ( tci ) .",
    "the tci for a given number of processors is nearly independent of the number of computational cells , and can be used as a time unit to estimate the total execution time needed in a particular simulation .    according to the data shown in tables [ tab_perf.gsch ] and [ tab_perf.essr ] the tci is about @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 seconds for 1 , 4 and 8 processors , respectively .",
    "a significant drop of the performance is noticeable for a grid of @xmath139 zones due to the phenomenon of _ cache trashing _ , because in this case the dimensions of the 3d matrices are multiples of the size of cache lines .",
    "hence , different 3d matrices are mapped into the same set of cache lines , and every time the program needs to reference a new 3d matrix all cache lines are updated .    concerning the speed up factor ,",
    "it is noticeable from tables [ tab_perf.gsch ] and [ tab_perf.essr ] that it increases with the number of grid points , because the 3d nested loops consume a larger percentage of the total cpu time when the number of grid zones is larger .",
    "the maximum speed up factors are 3.7 and 6.5 for 4 and 8 cpus , respectively .",
    "we also notice a _ super linear _",
    "behaviour , for the largest grid , for the mrrp test problem . as typical 3d simulations",
    "are performed with zone numbers larger than the ones used in the test runs , we expect to reach even larger speed up factors in these applications .",

    "reports a performance of 48 mflops for his 3d adaptive moving mesh classical hydrodynamic code using a sgi power challenge machine with r8000 processors ( 300 mflops theoretical peak speed ) .",
    "finally , we compare the performance of genesis achieved on the pa8000 processor of hewlett packard with that obtained on the r10000 processor of silicon graphics . for the comparison we used a hpj280 workstation equipped with a pa8000 processor with a 180 mhz clock and a cache memory of 512kbytes and a sgi cray - origin 2000 equipped with a r10000 processor with a 195 mhz clock and 4 mbytes of cache memory .",
    "the test problem selected for the comparison was the relativistic spherical shock reflection test ( rssr ) with an inflow velocity of @xmath128 .",
    "test runs were done with four different grids .",
    "the resulting execution times per zone and time step ( tci ) are given in table  [ hpvssgi ] .",

    "[ hpvssgi ] we can infer a general trend .",
    "the tcis obtained on both machines tend to become similar when the number of zones increases .",
    "furthermore , the tci for the hp machine is nearly independent of the number of zones , while the tci for the sgi machine increases with that number .",
    "this behaviour may result from the fact that the problem size always leads to an overflow of the cache memory on the hp workstation , while this does not generally happen for the larger cache memory of the sgi machine .",
    "next we discuss an astrophysical application computed with genesis , namely the 3d simulation of a relativistic jet propagating through an homogeneous atmosphere .",

    "1997 ) the simulation was performed in cylindrical coordinates assuming axial symmetry .",
    "the spatial resolution was 20 zones per beam radius both in the axial and radial directions .",
    "it is well known that the propagation of a supersonic jet is governed by the interaction of jet matter with the ambient medium , which produces a bow shock in the ambient medium and an envelope surrounding the central beam ( the _ cocoon _ , in the blandford & rees 1974 model ) .",
    "the cocoon contains jet material deflected backward at the head of the jet . in the case of highly supersonic jets , discussed in mart",
    "( 1997 ) , extensive , overpressured cocoons are formed with large vortices of jet matter propagating down the cocoon / ambient medium interface .",
    "the vortices are the result of kelvin  helmholtz instabilities at the interface between the jet and the shocked ambient medium .",
    "the interaction of these vortices with the central beam causes internal shocks inside the beam .",
    "these , in turn , affect the advance speed of the jet making it highly non  stationary .",
    "the propagation speed of the jet can be estimated from the momentum transfer between the jet and the ambient medium assuming a one dimensional flow .",
    "for model c2 one obtains an advance speed equal to @xmath149 , whereas the 2d hydrodynamic simulation presented in mart et al .",
    "( 1997 ) gives a mean jet advance speed of @xmath150 .",

    "the analysis of cross sections of the grid perpendicular to the the jet s direction of propagation ( not shown here ) reveals acceptable symmetry of the numerical simulation , i.e both the sls and the scs properties are maintained ( see  [ symmetry ] ) .",
    "the gross morphological and dynamical properties of highly supersonic relativistic jets as inferred from our 3d simulations are qualitatively similar to those established in earlier 2d simulations . an extensive , overpressured cocoon with pressure about 20 times that in the beam at the injection point is found surrounding the jet .",
    "the pressure and density at the head of the jet in the model with 8 zones@xmath152 are a factor of 2 larger and 1.3 smaller , respectively , than in the 2d calculation .",
    "for the model with 4 zones@xmath152 these factors are 1 and 1.3 , respectively .",
    "in contrast with the model with 4 zones@xmath152 , in which the propagation speed coincides with the 1d estimate , the larger pressure at the head of the jet in the model with 8 zones@xmath152 causes it to propagate through the ambient medium at a larger speed in the 3d calculation ( @xmath153 instead of @xmath149 for the 1d estimate and @xmath150 for the 2d simulation ) producing a narrower profile of the bow shock near the head . in all the simulations ,",
    "the supersonic beam displays rich internal structure with oblique shocks effectively decelerating the flow in the beam from a lorentz factor equal to 7 at the injection point down to a value of about 4 near the head . whereas gross morphological properties are qualitatively similar in all three simulations , finer jet details ( e.g. , number , size , position and development of turbulent vortices in the cocoon )",
    "do not agree .",
    "however , it has been pointed out before that the fine structure is highly dependent on the numerical grid resolution ( see , e.g. , kssl & mller 1988 ) . in the model with 4 zones/@xmath145 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_jet4 ] ) , the material deflected at the head of the jet forms a thick , stable overpressured cocoon surrounding the beam up to the nozzle . due to the small resolution",
    "only large vortices develope in the cocoon / external medium surface which grow slowly .",
    "a turbulent cocoon with smaller vortices growing at a faster rate ( much more similar to the one obtained in the 2d cylindrical model ) are obtained by doubling the resolution ( compare , e.g. , the proper rest  mass density pannels in figs . [ fig_jet4],[fig_jet ] ) .",
    "we have described the main features of a novel three dimensional , high  resolution special relativistic hydrodynamic code genesis based on relativistic riemann solvers .",
    "we have discussed several test problems involving strong shocks in three dimensions which genesis has passed successfully . the performance of genesis on single and multiprocessor machines ( hp j280 and sgi cray  origin 2000 ) has been investigated .",
