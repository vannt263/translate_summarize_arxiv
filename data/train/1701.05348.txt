    "when considering a physical system which is far from thermodynamic equilibrium and is open , i.e. which exchanges either mass , momentum or energy with the external world , it is customary to write the total time derivative @xmath2 of boltzmann - gibbs entropy    @xmath3    of the system in the form @xcite :    @xmath4    here and in the following , the word entropy refers to boltzmann - gibbs entropy only .",
    "we have adopted the notation of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ; @xmath5 and @xmath6 are boltzmann s constant and the distribution function respectively ; @xmath7 is the probability of finding the system at the time @xmath8 inside the volume element @xmath9 of a @xmath10-dimensional state space which is centered at @xmath11 and satisfies the normalization condition @xmath12 at all times .",
    "for instance , @xmath13 may be coordinates in @xmath14 , concentrations of chemical species , etc .",
    "moreover , @xmath0 and @xmath15 are the contributions of physical processes occurring inside the bulk of the system and at the system boundary respectively ( some authors denote @xmath0 and @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively ; we drop also the dependence on @xmath18 and @xmath8 unless otherwise specified below , for simplicity ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath0 may include e.g. joule heating , viscous heating etc .",
    "the quantity @xmath15 may be related to the exchange of mass , energy etc . with the external world ; it is the amount of entropy which escapes away from the system across the system boundaries per unit time and may be @xmath19 , depending on the particular problem .",
    "it is customary to write @xmath0 and @xmath15 as a volume integral of a suitably defined entropy production density @xmath20 ( referred to as entropy source strength in @xcite ) on the system volume and as a surface integral of some suitably defined entropy flow across the system boundary respectively . here",
    "@xmath21 at all times everywhere throughout the system because of the second principle of thermodynamics ( as for the counterexample provided by @xcite , see sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath22 at all times -see e.g. sec .",
    "49 of @xcite for a detailed discussion of this issue in the particular case of a viscous , thermally conducting fluid .",
    "in contrast with closed ( i.e. , not open ) systems where @xmath23 at thermodynamic equilibrium , the relative role of @xmath0 and @xmath15 in open systems far from thermodynamic equilibrium is far from being assessed even in the neighbourhood of steady states - but for a very restricted class of problems @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite . in particular , a crucial issue is the spontaneous evolution ( relaxation ) towards a final ( relaxed ) state .    as for closed systems ( where @xmath24 at all times ) , relaxation is related to a growth of @xmath25 towards its maximum value .",
    "thermodynamic equilibrium is the relaxed state ; its extremum property @xmath23 , which implies also @xmath26 , is related to stability of this state against perturbations . of course , if we decide to apply a transformation of coordinates :    @xmath27    the validity of the extremum property @xmath23 remains unaffected , just like the equations of motion involved in liouville theorem underlying it .",
    "this conclusion holds even if the actual value of @xmath25 may be not invariant under - see appendix [ proofs2 ] .",
    "invariance concerns the extremum property , rather than the actual value of the extremised quantity .    as for open systems ( where @xmath15 may @xmath28 )",
    ", boundary conditions may keep the relaxed state ( if any exists ) far from thermodynamic equilibrium , so that @xmath29 .",
    "the question if a description of stable relaxed states of an open system involves extremum properties while requiring no detailed knowledge of the microscopic dynamics of the system - in analogy with the familiar equilibrium thermodynamics - is still open .",
    "usually , once the extremum property is proven relaxation is described as the evolution of a system which starts from some initial condition inside a suitable attraction basin and ends at the configuration corresponding to the extremum .",
    "some researchers have invoked the so - called local thermodynamic equilibrium approximation ( lte ) @xcite . in a nutshell",
    ", lte means that - although the total system is not at thermodynamic equilibrium - the relationships among thermodynamic quantities within a small mass element are the same as in real equilibrium .",
    "lte leads to the so - called general evolution criterion , an exact result concerning the total time derivatives of thermodynamic quantities @xcite , which rules relaxation in many physical systems - see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review .",
    "moreover , it has been proven @xcite that relaxed states in open systems satisfy extremum properties if some very restrictive assumptions are satisfied , like onsager symmetry relationships @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is onsager matrix : these properties are glansdorff and prigogine s minimum entropy production principle of suitably constrained minimization of @xmath2 , henceforth referred to as minep , and its equivalent formulation , onsager and machlup s least dissipation principle. the relevant formulation of minep depends on the actual boundary conditions .",
    "the proof of minep relies on the positive sign of scalar quantities like the quadratic form @xmath32 , with @xmath33 @xmath34-th and @xmath35-th thermodynamic force respectively .",
    "scalars are invariant under , hence minep too is invariant under .",
    "if such restrictions are dropped , minep does not apply @xcite @xcite .    among the many attempts to go beyond lte and onsager ,",
    "many authors have postulated a maximum entropy production principle ( mepp ) in different forms @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite",
    "@xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite - for a review , see @xcite .",
    "according to mepp , a stable relaxed state corresponds to a suitably constrained maximum of @xmath2 . to date , and in spite of its present popularity , attempts to derive mepp rigorously meet no general consensus @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite , as they _are so far unconvincing since they often require introduction of additional hypotheses , which by themselves are less evident than the proven statement_ @xcite - see also the critical review of @xcite .",
    "a way out is to drop altogether , and to postulate - in the framework of the so - called extended irreversbiel thermodynamics - that entropy depends locally not only on temperature , pressure etc . but also on the heat flux and the viscous stress tensor @xcite .",
    "however , the results reviewed in @xcite cast doubt on the very existence of a mepp - like , general - purpose extremum property of @xmath2 in far - from - equilibrium , stable , relaxed states ; for selected classes of problems , however , validity of variational principles concerning particular contributions to the entropy balance remains possible .",
    "for instance , many alleged applications of mepp seem indeed to be statements concerning @xmath15 -see appendix [ meppapp ] for further discussion .",
    "a different , quite successful approach to non - equilibrium , namely stochastic thermodynamics ( st ) , deals precisely with selected classes of physical systems , namely those systems where a non - equilibrium process occurs which is coupled to one ( or several ) heat bath(s ) of constant temperature .",
    "st provides a framework for extending the notions of familiar thermodynamics like work , heat and entropy production to the level of individual trajectories across the space state of the system - see the reviews of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "typically , st describes systems where a few observable degrees of freedom - like the positions of colloidal particles or the gross conformations of biomolecules - are in non - equilibrium due to the action of possibly time - dependent external forces , fields , flow or unbalanced chemical reactants .",
    "in contrast with the approaches described above , which deal with large ( macroscopic ) systems where fluctuations around mean values may be negligible , st is uniquely suitable for describing smaller ( mesoscopic ) systems where the role of ( usually quantum - mechanical ) fluctuations is not negligible . in the following , and with a slightly misleading wording , we take the words macroscopic , classical , large and non - degenerate as interchangeable ; in the spirit of our thermodynamic treatment , a rigorous definition of the words macroscopic and mesoscopic is provided in sec . [ sec6ter ] which invokes no information on the detailed mechanics underlying fluctuations .    the time - scale separation between the observable , typically slow , degrees of freedom of the system and the unobservable fast ones ( linked either with thermal baths or with the internal dynamics of the system , like e.g. in the case of biopolymers ) , together with the fact that temperatures remain well - defined at all times , allows for a consistent thermodynamic description in st .",
    "internal energy , entropy and free energy are well - defined and , in principle , computable for fixed values of the slow variables .",
    "usually , the time - scale separation implies that the dynamics becomes markovian , i.e. , the future state of the system depends only on the present one with no memory of the past .",
    "if the states are made up by continuous variables ( like position ) , the dynamics follows a langevin equation for an individual system and a fokker - planck equation for the whole ensemble .",
    "this is another difference from the above described approaches , which rely on no detailed description of dynamics .    rather than to conditions for stability of relaxed states ,",
    "st leads to a large number of exact results - usually referred to as fluctuation theorems ( fts ) .",
    "basically , fts are mathematical identities derived from the invariance of the microscopic dynamics under time - reversal - see e.g. assumption ( 2 ) in sec .",
    "2.1 of @xcite .",
    "they acquire physical meaning by associating their mathematical ingredients with the thermodynamic quantities identified within st .",
    "the success of invariance - based fts in the description of some mesoscopic systems is confirmed by experiments .",
    "it suggests that even a rigorous non - equilibrium thermodynamics of some selected classes of macroscopic systems should take advantage of some property of invariance - just like in some systems onsager symmetry follows from invariance of microscopic dynamics under time reversal .",
    "remarkably , a derivation of mepp from the second principle of thermodynamics actually exists , but only provided that _the maximum flow is taken as a zero flow _ [ ... ] _ in practice , this can be realised , e.g. by time / space scaling_ @xcite . generally speaking , therefore",
    ", a different choice of _time / space scaling_ seems to lead to violation of mepp , i.e. mepp may not be invariant under .",
    "in contrast , some authors @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite suggest that invariance under is precisely a requirement for meaningful extremum properties for stable relaxed states of selected , open macroscopic systems .",
    "( in the following , by invariance we mean invariance under  ) .",
    "the issue is far from being purely academic . generally speaking ,",
    "when it comes to systems which remain confined at all times with a certain region @xmath36 of the phase space , does _ not _ leave the measure of @xmath36 unaffected . as a matter of principle , therefore , should an invariant extremum property for stable relaxed states actually exist , it would provide information concerning stability regardless of the size of the system ; in other words , a common thermodynamic description of stability would be available for both macroscopic and mesoscopic systems .",
    "a simple , far - reaching corollary follows straightforwardly . to date",
    ", the relaxed states are usually assumed to be steady states in the non - equilibrium thermodynamics of macroscopic systems - for an exception concerning minep , see e.g. chap .",
    "xv of ref .",
    "in contrast , cyclic behaviour plays a central role in st .",
    "in fact , despite the fundamental difference between isothermal engines operating at one temperature and genuine heat engines like thermoelectric devices involving two baths of different temperature , st provides a common framework based on the representation of entropy production in terms of cycles of the underlying network of states @xcite .",
    "accordingly , should an invariant extremum property for stable relaxed states actually exist , it would provide information on the stability of both steady and oscillating relaxed states .",
    "a bridge could be established between different problems of stability far from thermodynamic equilibrium .    in this paper",

    "any physical system undergoing a markovian evolution dictated by a fokker - planck equation in thermal contact with an environment ( say , a thermal bath ) provides us @xcite with an example of a system described by ; generalization is discussed in @xcite .",

    "together , invariance of the latter relationship and equation lead to : @xmath92 , a quantity which may differ from 1 .",
    "this means that @xmath93 is usually not invariant .",
    "it follows that if an invariant criterion of stability exists , then it holds regardless of the actual value of @xmath93 ; in particular , it may hold for both macroscopic and mesoscopic systems , as anticipated in [ sec1 ] .",

    "the words small perturbation refer to a perturbation with small measure in the riemannian variety of the @xmath42 s .",
    "the word stability refers to the fact that if we apply a small perturbation to a steady state then the perturbation relaxes back to the initial state ; @xmath101 ( which is zero before the perturbation ) takes a non - zero value with a well - defined sign ( possibly oscillating in time ) , and after a while relaxes back to zero .    to start with , we observe that the set @xmath102 of transformations , , , and maps the space @xmath103 onto itself . by construction",

    "it follows that @xmath102 can map the stable steady state ( if any exists ) of a physical system which satisfies onto the stable steady state of another physical system which satisfies , both steady states having the same value of @xmath0 .",
    "the basins of attraction of stable states may be different in different physical systems , as the equations of motion may be different ; but as far as these equations include , our argument remains unaffected .",

    "invariance bridges the gap between the problems of stability of some selected macroscopic and mesoscopic systems .    in order to discuss applications ,",
    "we start with the following remark . as far",
    "as we investigate their stability against slowly evolving perturbations , a macroscopic , classical fluid - with joule and viscous heating , negligible mass diffusion , no net mass source and negligible mass flow across the boundary - and a mesoscopic system satisfying - with @xmath128 as the state space - enjoy the same property : both can be mapped onto a pivotal system . in the macroscopic fluid , equation reduces to a simple mass balance ; in the mesoscopic system , investigation of stability against slow perturbations allow us to invoke the slow diffusion approximation .",
    "consequently , they share also the same necessary condition of constrained minimization of @xmath217 } } $ ] for the stability of relaxed states . the equations of motion provide the constraints , which depend therefore on the particular system of interest .",
    "it does not matter what the detailed dynamics is like ; what is relevant here is that such mapping is possible .",
    "examples of the macroscopic fluids quoted above are the filamentary configuration of the electrons in the dpf pinch and a ( possibly unmagnetized ) fluid near the onset of rayleigh - bnard convection ; indeed , it is shown in appendix [ cgleapp ] that the problems of stability of the two systems are dual to ech other , even if the dynamics is utterly different .    beyond thermodynamic equilibrium ( where of course @xmath217 } } \\equiv 0 $ ] ) , in the following we are going to discuss four particular problems as particular cases of the macroscopic and the mesoscopic systems hinted at above . in each case , we have derived from the constrained minimization of @xmath217 } } $ ] a necessary condition of stability , not necessarily in the form of a variational principle .",
    "the criterion of stability we obtain depends on the particular problem .",
    "noteworthy , both minep and mepp apply in no case . in particular , according to the language of ref .",
    "@xcite all macroscopic systems we deal with in the following are compound systems , where mepp fails .",
    "this is not surprising , as both minep and mepp are concerned with the entropy produced per unit time by all irreversible processes in the system , while @xmath0 is the amount produced per unit time by the irreversible processes only which occur in the bulk . in all cases we retrieve results previously available in the literature , independently derived from either observations or dedicated proofs from first principles .",

    "_ for an isolated system , the constraints represent constants of the motion . _",
    "[ ... ] _ the qualifying and unifying feature of this dynamical principle is the direction of maximal entropy increase . _",
    "[ ... ] _ the challenge with this approach is to ascertain if the intrinsic irreversibility it implies at the single particle ( local , microscopic ) level is experimentally verifiable , or else its mathematics must only be considered yet another phenomenological tool_. recent research aims precisely at comparison of predictions based on steepest descent approach and experiments where relaxation is postulated to follow a particular law - we refer to @xcite and in particular to its equation ( 12 ) . when it comes to classical physics , the constraints acting on the relaxation identify a hyper - surface in the phase space of the system . in the words of @xcite , _on",
    "this surface we can identify contour curves of constant entropy , generated by intersecting it with the constant - entropy surfaces .",
    "every trajectory _ [ ... ] _ lies_ on this surface _and is at each point orthogonal to the constant entropy contour passing through that point . in this sense ,",
    "the trajectory follows a path of steepest entropy ascent compatible with the constraints_. however , this conclusion relies on the postulate that relaxation obeys a particular law -see equation ( 25 ) of @xcite , retrieved also in equation ( 12 ) of @xcite .",
    "admittedly , general arguments supporting mepp are discussed in @xcite .",
    "remarkably , however , this work seems to identify a property of @xmath15 , rather than of @xmath2 .",

    "for example , the growth of a crystal is obviously affected by what happens at its boundaries .",
    "correspondingly , the selection criterion discussed in @xcite is related to the _conjecture that each lamella must grow in a direction which is perpendicular to the solidification front_. analogously , the results of @xcite are related to the growth velocity via the _rate of entropy production per unit area_ , which is a surface quantity like @xmath15 and unlike @xmath0 .",
    "finally , in @xcite a crystal grows and changes its surface so as to select a flow which maximises the entropy production , @xmath345 being the only contribution to the entropy balance which depends on both a flow and the surface of the system . as for solidification ,",
    "the relevant quantity is the _entropy generation term which depends on the solid - liquid region_ @xcite , i.e. on an interfacial boundary . as for the atmosphere , the only contribution to the entropy balance investigated in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite is due to energy fluxes across boundaries",

    "in contrast , the agreement of mepp with models of a stratified atmosphere including viscosity ( so that @xmath0 is not negligible ) seems to be poor @xcite . as for plasmas , what is actually maximized in equation ( 7 ) of @xcite is the inhomogeneity of temperature in a boundary layer , i.e. a quantity related to @xmath15 .",
    "in contrast with mepp , different extremum properties for @xmath0 and @xmath15 seem to hold for relaxed states of different physical systems under different boundary conditions -see e.g. sec . 3 of @xcite for a particular example and @xcite for a more general discussion , which includes some of the results quoted above .",
    "for instance , the latter discussion involves also an extremum property similar to what is proposed in @xcite , but concerning @xmath345 rather than @xmath2 ; such property is suggested in @xcite for a shock wave in the limit of large mach number , where the volume integral @xmath0 is as vanishingly small as the volume occupied by the shock front .",

    "now , the latter equation , which we write in the form      describes also the steady state of a fluid near the onset @xmath460 of rayleigh - bnard convection - see equation ( 5 ) of @xcite for the case @xmath461 and equation ( 3 ) of @xcite for the general case respectively ; here @xmath462 and @xmath463 are positive constants , @xmath464 and @xmath465 is the laplacian on some rescaled spatial coordinate @xmath241 . depending on the values of @xmath145 and @xmath403 , the boundary condition on @xmath466 may be either dirichlet ( @xmath467 ) , neumann ( @xmath468 ) or a linear combination of the two ( @xmath469 ) .",
    "together , the fact that @xmath470 and equation allow us to find a rescaling which maps in steady state and onto each other ( gradients of @xmath471 are negligible in the slow diffusion approximation , because of ) .",
    "in particular , once both @xmath472 , @xmath473 , @xmath474 and @xmath475 are known then in steady state reduces to provided that we identify @xmath476 and @xmath241 with @xmath477 , @xmath478 , @xmath479 , @xmath480 and @xmath481 respectively .",

    "there is still room for 5 - 4 = 1 degree of freedom , namely @xmath215 .    in other words ,",
    "a steady state fluid on the verge of rayleigh - bnard convection is in the same class of equivalence of a particular pivotal system , namely the steady , relaxed filamentary configuration of a dpf pinch .",
    "it is precisely the fact that dissipation is not required for the description of the steady relaxed state - see sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] - which allows the inviscid equation to provide information on the steady relaxed configurations of fluids with convection .",
    "rather , dissipation describes relaxation ; the latter is very slow in the slow diffusion approximation and may therefore safely be described as a slow succession of steady states .",
    "of course , detailed dynamics is completely different in the two systems : dpf filaments are steady only when compared with mhd time - decay , the temperature gradient across the fluid is not negligible , radiation transport of heat occurs across the dpf , and is it is not even required that a magnetic field occurs in the rayleigh - bnard case . but dynamics provides just constraints on minimization of @xmath0 ; it does not change the fact that if a steady state is stable in one system - hence @xmath485 - then the corresponding steady state is also stable in the other system - i.e. , @xmath0 remains a minimum .",
    "this is in analogy to what happens at thermodynamic equilibrium , where the fact that @xmath25 attains a maximum does not depend on the choice of the @xmath18 s .",
    "we may say that the problems of stability of the electric current filaments in a dpf pinch and of a fluid near rayleigh - bnard convection are dual to each other ."
