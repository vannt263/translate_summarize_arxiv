    "only a few detections of extrasolar planets atmospheric species are reported so far , but they have been recognized as important steps in our understanding of these objects . of particular interest are _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) observations of hd209458b during primary transit , which yielded the detection of nai ( @xcite ) , as well as hi , oi , and cii ( @xcite ) , hi ( @xcite ) , rayleigh scattering by h@xmath8 ( @xcite ) , along with upper limits on the presence of tio and vo ( @xcite ) and recently confirmation of cii and detection of siiii ( @xcite ) and even possibly siiv ( @xcite ) .",
    "hd189733b is the second transiting planet for which hst observations yielded information on the atmospheric transmission spectrum .",

    "their result is an estimate of the transit absorption depth ( ad ) as a function of wavelength from 3000    to 8000   .",
    "the variation of absorption depth as function of wavelength has been interpreted by atmospheric signatures of na , h@xmath8 rayleigh scattering and tio  vo molecules ( @xcite ) .",
    "another important result obtained with the analysis of this transit absorption spectrum is the observation of a sharp drop in sodium abundance above the altitude corresponding to the absorption depth of 1.485% ( @xcite ) .",
    "this drop is clearly seen in the profile of the sodium absorption line , which differs from the classical `` eiffel tower '' shape found when there is a constant sodium abundance ( _ e.g. _ , seager & sasselov 2000 ) .",
    "the sodium line shows a plateau with an almost constant absorption depth around ad@xmath51.485% at several hundred angstroms around the line center .",
    "closer to the line center in the line core , the absorption depth increases again with a shape more like the `` eiffel tower '' above the plateau , which shows that the sodium is still present above the altitude of the abundance drop . to match the width of the core of the sodium line , the drop in sodium abundance should be at least a factor of 10 ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , if the interpretation of the ad rise at wavelengths shorter than @xmath5  5000    in terms of rayleigh scattering by h@xmath8 molecules is correct , then the pressure at the altitude of the abundance drop is constrained to be about 3  mbar ( @xcite ) .",

    "two different profiles provide an equally good fit to the absorption spectrum : the first profile involves na condensation to explain the abundance drop at the absorption depth of 1.485% ; in the second profile the temperature is not low enough to allow the sodium condensation , and the decrease in sodium absorption at altitude above the plateau is interpreted by ionization . the two resulting t ",

    "i.e. _ in a fixed 50  region .",

    "( 2008a ) also extracted _ spectroscopically _ the absorption depth distribution over each pixel in the whole spectral range covered by the observations .",
    "these spectroscopic absorption depths can also be averaged over different spectral bandwidths as in the photometric approach .",
    "we calculated the difference between the spectrum averaged over various bands centered on the nai lines and the spectrum averaged in the reference band , _ ref _ , defined above .",
    "the result obtained in this `` spectroscopic '' approach ( see figure  [ fig : obs1 ] ) can be directly compared with `` photometric '' result .",
    "small differences do show up between the two extraction methods , but they are well within the error bars .",
    "the main differences probably arise from the limb  darkening correction , which is applied at each pixel wavelength in the spectroscopic approach , while the correction is a weighted average limb  darkening correction in the considered bands in the `` photometric '' approach .",
    "therefore , the `` spectroscopic '' is expected to provide a better correction for the limb  darkening variations within the stellar lines themselves and in particular within the two strong nai doublet lines . in the following ,",
    "we use the spectroscopic absorption depths .    in figure",
    "[ fig : obs1 ] the measured absorption depths have been translated into planetary radii , i.e. , altitudes above the _ ref _ level , defined by the level of the absorption depth in the _ ref _ spectral domain . to translate ad into altitudes above the _ ref _ level , we used r@xmath11=1.32r@xmath12 ( @xcite ) for the planetary radius and an absorption depth of ad@xmath13  =  1.49145%  at the _ ref _ level .",
    "as expected , the observed altitudes ( _ i.e. _ ad ) vary as a function of the bandwidth with a slow rise toward smaller bandwidths ; however , three different regions could be seen in terms of ad variations : a region [ i ] ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : obs1 ] ) presenting a rapid decrease of the ad with increasing bandwidths followed by a kind of plateau ( region  [ ii ] ) , a puzzling feature discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : discuss ] followed by a last region [ iii ] where a slow decrease in the ad could be seen .",
    "these observations are not independent . in particular , the error bars are larger than the observations fluctuations .",

    ", we will complete our analysis of the observed behavior of the ad by starting from the larger bandwidths and moving inward .",
    "this approach will give us first access to the atmospheric information at the lower altitudes and then , by eliminating this information in the narrower bandwidths , move progressively upwards in the atmosphere .",
    "the variations in the absorption depth ( or variations of the corresponding altitude ) along the line profile are due to variations of the line opacity . at each wavelength , the absorption line probes different altitudes in the planetary atmosphere with a resolution on the order of the error bar on the absorption estimate , _",

    "[ fig : obs1 ] ) . these variations in absorption altitude ( or absorption depth )",
    "can be interpreted through comparison with model calculations .      to interpret the measured variations in absorption with bandwidths",
    ", we built the simplest possible model , _",
    "i.e. _ an isothermal hydrostatic uniform abundance model ( _ ihua _ ) . the model with isothermal hydrostatic atmosphere at temperature @xmath14 with a single sodium abundance value ( [ na / h ] , relative to the solar abundance ) , and",

    "( 2008a ) . despite its simplicity , assuming hydrostatic equilibrium , this ( _ ihua _ ) model still holds _ locally _ to interpret observational measurements because the atmospheric scale height is on the order of the observational accuracy , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath5  300  km for typical temperatures in the hd209458b atmosphere .",
    "the exponential decrease in the volume density with altitude is very steep ; as a result , the variations in the measured absorption at a given altitude are directly related to the physical conditions ( temperature , abundance ) in the atmosphere at the corresponding altitude .",

    "[ z_lambda ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the _ relative _ absorption depth in the sodium line does not depend on the sodium abundance as shown in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "indeed a change in the abundance produces about the same shift in the absorption depth at all wavelengths .",

    "the sodium abundance thus can not be estimated by the transmission spectrum of _ relative _ absorption depth .",
    "however , the variations in the _ relative _ absorption depth does allow estimating the local temperature @xmath14 at the absorption altitude . in effect , the variation in the absorption altitude with wavelength depends on the variation in the horizontal integrated density with altitude . for instance , if one considers two wavelengths @xmath48 and @xmath49 , with corresponding line cross section @xmath50 , a grazing line of sight will have the same optical thickness at these two wavelengths if they are at altitude @xmath51 at @xmath48 and @xmath52 at @xmath49 such that the variation in partial density of the absorbing element @xmath53 between @xmath51 and @xmath52 compensates for the different cross sections .",
    "the optical thickness at these two wavelengths are equal if @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , the variation in the observed absorption altitude as a function of wavelength ( equivalent to variation as a function of line cross section ) reveals the variation in the partial density at the considered altitude . at hydrostatic equilibrium ,",
    "the density variation with altitude is determined by the temperature through the characteristic scale height .",
    "as a consequence , the temperature constrains the slope of the absorption altitude as a function of wavelength .",
    "the higher the temperature , the larger the slope . for a given absorption feature with a known cross section as a function of wavelength ,",
    "the temperature @xmath14 can be derived from the measurements of the absorption altitude spectrum using ( @xcite ) :    @xmath55    140k , 540k ( solid lines ) , shifted in ordinate toward the lower end of the first error bar at 105  in order to show the constraints on the model slopes ( not affected by the applied shift ) related to the observational error bars .",

    "using the method described above , we start by evaluating the temperature at altitudes just above the reference level ( altitude 0225  km , bandwidths 75110   ) , with the reference level corresponding to the level where the sodium abundance drops sharply ( @xmath53  mbar level ) . the temperature of the atmosphere just above the reference level ( see fig .

    "( 2009 ) because their result suffers from uncertainties in the process of continuum fitting and subtraction of the earth atmosphere absorption .",

    "an important comment here before presenting the result is to recall that the evaluated t ",

    "e.g. _ from equatorial to polar regions . in a first step , such an `` integrated  averaged '' t ",
    "p profile could be compared to 1d model calculations , although it is clear that later steps , when observations permit it , would be to compare them to more sophisticated 3d models as illustrated in _",

    "as already mentioned in the introduction , at pressures above 3  mbar , the evaluated observational profiles do not present variations similar to the model predictions as calculated in the literature specifically for hd209458b ( _ e.g. _ barman et al .",

    "it is interesting to note that all temperature predictions at about 3  mbar are in good agreement with our evaluation simply made from the direct estimation of the scale height at these levels .",

    "[ fig : t - p ] .",
    "this may indicate that indeed such model predictions are difficult to compare to observations according to their extreme sensitivity to the precise limb geometry and , as already said , to the integrated nature of the observations along a grazing line of sight .",
    "also , one could argue that at higher pressures , it is not surprising that observations ( and their interpretation ) differ from theoretical models , since for instance , a large heat advection could be critical in the troposphere leading to strong departures from equilibrium temperature profiles .    above this condensation layer , a progressive rise in the temperature with altitude is needed to explain the profile of the sodium line toward narrower bandpasses .",
