    "dynamical stability of quantum systems was studied from various viewpoints , e.g. from those of quantum chaos and energy diffusion in general  @xcite . in the field of quantum information ,",
    "a lot of attention has been paid to the fidelity , which also describes dynamical stability  @xcite .",
    "the fidelity is defined as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are unperturbed ( @xmath4 ) and perturbed ( @xmath5 ) time evolutions , respectively .",
    "when the initial state @xmath6 is an eigenstate of the unperturbed hamiltonian , @xmath7 coincides with a survival probability .",
    "the fidelity and the survival probability are also studied in the context of quantum irreversibility  @xcite . those studies on fidelity ,",
    "survival probability and energy diffusion have so far concentrated on highly - excited states or coherent states in random matrix models and kicked spin models . in real physics of condensed matter , however , it is more essential to elucidate the dynamical stability of the ground state for many - body quantum systems , which are non - integrable , against perturbations .",
    "the properties of dynamical stability can depend on the level statistics of systems .",
    "recently , the level statistics of xxz spin chains with a time - independent random magnetic field is studied in ref .",
    "when the anisotropy parameter @xmath8 is nonzero , gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) level statistics appears for a large field although poisson - like level statistics is seen for a small field .",
    "when @xmath9 , however , the level statistics always shows poissonian behavior .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to know how a time - periodic random field will affect the dynamics of quantum spin systems with and without goe level statistics .    in this paper",
    ", we will study the dynamical stability of quantum xxz spin chains against perturbations induced by a time - periodic and spatially - inhomogeneous magnetic field .",
    "we use the survival probability as a measure of the dynamical stability and show how the survival probability is related to the level statistics . by theoretical and numerical analysis , we will demonstrate that normal diffusion occurs in the linear response region .",
    "numerical analysis will also exhibit how the survival probability depends on the anisotropy parameter @xmath8 , the field strength and the field frequency .",
