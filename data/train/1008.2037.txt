    "understanding the nature of mechanical stability , how it arises , and how it can be controlled is important to fields ranging from civil engineering to biology .",
    "james clerk maxwell was among the first to address this problem with mathematical rigor in his 1864 paper @xcite in which he established the conditions for the mechanical stability of a frame of points connected by lines or struts of fixed length .",
    "his approach , which can easily be generalized to treat particles interacting via central - force potentials or bonds between particles interacting via an angular potential , has since been used to study network glasses @xcite , randomly packed spheres near jamming @xcite , networks of semi - flexible polymers @xcite , regular @xcite and random @xcite periodic lattices , and a host of engineering problems @xcite . in this paper , we study the mode structure of a particular lattice - the kagome lattice shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kagorand ] - in which nearest neighbor ( @xmath1 ) sites are connected by harmonic central - force springs of spring constant @xmath19 and next - nearest - neighbor ( @xmath4 ) sites are randomly connected by similar springs but with a different spring constant @xmath20 . in the absence of @xmath4 springs , finite realizations of this lattice",
    "are just on the verge of mechanical stability in the maxwell sense .",
    "the addition of @xmath4 springs renders the system stable .",
    "when these springs are added uniformly with a spring constant @xmath5 that is allowed to approach zero continuously @xcite , the result is a kind of critical point at @xmath21 with a rich mode structure and diverging length and vanishing frequency scales as @xmath22 that have direct counterparts in the properties of randomly packed spheres near jamming @xcite . here we use the coherent potential approximation or cpa @xcite ( otherwise know as the effective medium approximation ) to explore in detail the static and dynamical mechanical properties and mode structure of the kagome lattice as a function of the probability @xmath12 that @xmath4 sites are connected by springs .",
    "we find that the effective medium @xmath4 spring constant @xmath23 scales as @xmath10 for small @xmath12 , and it gives rise to length and frequency scales @xmath24 and @xmath25 . beyond a characteristic frequency @xmath26 ,",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath27 rises quickly and phonons scatter strongly .",
    "the ioffe - regel limit beyond which certain plane wave states become ill - defined is reached at a frequency slightly larger than @xmath28 .",
    "maxwell @xcite argued that each constraint in a system of @xmath2 points in @xmath29-dimensions reduces the number , @xmath30 , of zero frequency modes of free points by one .",
    "thus , the number of zero frequency modes in a system with @xmath31 constraints is @xmath32 .",
    "of these , @xmath33 are those of rigid translations and rotations , leaving @xmath34 internal zero frequency modes , which are usually refereed to as floppy modes @xcite or mechanisms in the engineering literature  @xcite , when @xmath35 .",
    "mechanical stability requires that there be no floppy modes , or equivalently that @xmath36 .",
    "though maxwell considered general frames of points , his analysis can immediately be applied to the determination of mechanical stability of extended crystals and glasses - as was first done in the context of network glasses , which are unstable in the absence of bending forces , by phillips and thorpe @xcite - in which points are replaced by particles or atoms and struts are replaced by inter - particle potentials .",
    "if each particle in an extended system is on average connected by central - force potential creating bonds to @xmath8 other particles , then , because each bond is shared by two particles , the system experiences @xmath37 constraints if bond lengths are restricted to be at their equilibrium length and there are no redundant bonds @xcite , and it has @xmath38 floppy modes .",
    "thus , in the limit of large @xmath2 , a central - force system is mechanically stable if @xmath39 . in an infinitely extended system",
    ", @xmath8 is independent of @xmath2 . in a finite system cut from an infinite one , particles at the boundary",
    "have fewer neighbors than those in the interior , and @xmath8 ( which is an average quantity ) is of order @xmath40 smaller than it would be in the ideal infinite system .",
    "systems with @xmath41 are called isostatic .",
    "a finite piece of @xmath2 particles cut from an infinite isostatic has a surface with of order @xmath42 cut bonds , and thus that many fewer constraints and that many more floppy modes .",
    "these modes generally remain floppy even if they have finite amplitudes if there are free boundary conditions . because of their geometry with straight segments extending throughout their interior",
    ", the square , the kagome , and related lattice of @xmath2 sites with periodic rather than free boundary conditions have @xmath42 infinitesimal floppy modes - modes that have zero energy for infinitesimal displacements but finite energy for large displacements @xcite .",
    "the simplest example of an infinitesimal floppy modes is that of a mass connected to two identical co - linear springs that are rigidly attached to walls on either side of the mass .",
    "if the springs are not under tension , infinitesimal displacements of the particle perpendicular to the spring cost no energy but finite displacements do . thus the harmonic kagome lattice has @xmath43 floppy modes .",
    "the recently most explored random isostatic system is perhaps the system of randomly close - packed spheres at the jamming transition @xcite in the system of frictionless soft spheres with one - sided repulsion .",
    "this transition occurs when the volume faction @xmath44 of spheres just exceeds the critical value @xmath45 at which they form just enough contacts to support a compressional load .",
    "thus at @xmath45 , the bulk modulus @xmath46 jumps discontinuously to a nonzero value , the number of neighbors per particle grows as @xmath47 , and the shear modulus grows continuously from zero as @xmath48 .",
    "associated with this transition are a diverging length scale @xmath49 and vanishing frequency scale @xmath14 whose behavior follows from quite general  cutting \" arguments @xcite .",
    "isostaticity is not limited to random systems .",
    "there are a number of periodic isostatic lattices with @xmath50 @xmath1 bonds per particle .",
    "these include the hypercubic lattice in @xmath29 dimensions and the kagome lattice in two - dimensions and its generalization to higher dimensions with @xmath1 bonds occupied by springs of spring constant @xmath51 , all with @xmath52 .",
    "they can be moved off isostaticity by introducing springs of spring constant @xmath5 on @xmath4 bonds either homogeneously or randomly .    in homogeneous systems ,",
    "the isostatic limit is continuously approached by allowing @xmath22 . in the square - lattice version of this model @xcite ,",
    "the bulk modulus is nonzero at @xmath53 , but the shear modulus vanishes as @xmath5 in this limit . in the kagome version ,",
    "both the shear and the bulk moduli are nonzero at @xmath53 . in both models , as in the jamming problem , there is a divergent length scale , @xmath54 and a vanishing frequency scale @xmath55 .",
    "the coherent potential , or equivalently the effective medium , approximation ( cpa ) @xcite is a powerful tool for the calculation of properties of random systems , from the electronic structure of alloys @xcite to the elasticity of composite materials @xcite .",
    "it has been used with great success in the study of rigidity percolation problem @xcite and , more recently , in the dynamics of off - lattice systems near a rigidity threshold  @xcite .",
    "it also provides a quantitative theory of the static and dynamic phonon response in the nearly isostatic square lattice in which next - nearest - neighbor springs ( @xmath4 ) are randomly added to a lattice in which all nearest - neighbor - site connected by equivalent springs @xcite . in this lattice ,",
    "the effective - medium @xmath4 spring constant @xmath56 has a zero - frequency limit , @xmath57 , that scales as @xmath58 leading to lengths and frequencies that scale as @xmath15 and @xmath59 as they do in the jamming problem .",
    "the finite - frequency spring constant is a scaling function of @xmath17 at small @xmath12 : @xmath60 .",
    "as @xmath12 is increased , there is a crossover from nonaffine response at small @xmath12 to affine response with @xmath61 at larger @xmath12 , much as there is in networks of semi - flexible polymers as the average polymer length is increased @xcite      in this paper , we use the cpa to explore in detail the static and dynamic properties of the kagome lattice as it is moved away from isostaticity by the random addition of @xmath4 springs .",
    "our approach is identical to that employed in our treatment of the square lattice @xcite , but calculations are considerably more complicated because each unit cell has three sites rather than a single one .",
    "the results of our calculations follow what we expect from our experience with the homogeneous square and kagome lattices and with the random square lattice . the bulk and shear moduli are nonzero and proportional to the @xmath1 spring constant @xmath51 when @xmath62 . the static @xmath4 effective medium spring constant @xmath57 scales as @xmath10 leading to @xmath49 and @xmath63 in agreement with cutting arguments . as is the case in the square lattice",

    "in this section we briefly review the elastic energy in central - force network models , in which the elastic energy @xmath71 can be written as a sum of the energy of each central - force bond @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the length of the bond and @xmath74 is the potential energy of the bond as a function of the length .",
    "we consider a displacement field on the network that maps particle @xmath75 which is at position @xmath76 to a new position @xmath77 , thus the length of bond @xmath78 between particle @xmath75 and @xmath79 is changed into @xmath80 we refer to the original space in which particle @xmath75 is at @xmath76 as the _ reference space _ , and the space after applying the displacement field as the _ target space_. we consider harmonic potentials @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the rest length of the bond , and @xmath83 is the spring constant . the length @xmath73 can be expanded for small displacement @xmath84 as @xmath85 where @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 is the unit vector pointing along the bond in the reference space .",
    "thus we have @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the magnitude of the force on the bond in the reference space .",
    "in general we consider the case in which the reference state is in mechanical equilibrium , which means that the total force on each particle vanishes @xmath91 where the sum @xmath92 is over all occupied bonds connected to @xmath75 .",
    "however , to capture the properties of random networks , which often carry residual stress , the length of each bond is not necessarily at its rest length , i.e. , @xmath93 in general .",
