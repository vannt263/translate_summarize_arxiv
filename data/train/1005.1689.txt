    "the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry ( sb@xmath11s ) has been one of the most important and intriguing subjects for decades because sb@xmath11s reveals complicated structures of the qcd vacuum .",
    "its restoration at finite temperature ( @xmath2 ) and/or baryon chemical potential ( @xmath12 ) can be understood microscopically as the qcd vacuum effect is diminished and the system changes its nature drastically at a certain @xmath12-@xmath2 point , as @xmath2 and/or @xmath12 increase .",
    "the restoration of chiral symmetry can be observed by the changes in the chiral order parameters such as the chiral condensate , the chiral susceptibility , dynamically - generated effective quark mass via sb@xmath11s , weak - decay constant and mass of the nambu - goldstone ( ng ) boson , etc . in principle ,",
    "lattice qcd ( lqcd ) simulation is the most promising method to deal with it , although the sign problem has been a huddle at finite @xmath12 . to investigate the chiral restoration at finite @xmath2 and/or @xmath12 ,",
    "there have been also many effective approaches such as the qcd sum rules  @xcite , nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite , dyson - schinger method  @xcite , polyakov - loop augmented njl model ( pnjl )  @xcite , gauge - gravity duality model  @xcite , hidden - local symmetry ( hls ) model  @xcite , chiral - perturbation theroy ( @xmath11pt )  @xcite , instanton model  @xcite , functional renormalization - group method  @xcite , and so on .",
    "the patterns of chiral symmetry restoration are intricately linked with the quark mass . at high @xmath2 , for qcd with two - flavor massless quarks , the associated pattern of chiral restoration is belonged to the universal class of o(4 ) spin model in three dimension",
    ", therefore it is second - order transition .",
    "however , with the small quark mass , the second - order transition is replaced by a smooth crossover . on the other hand , there is growing evidence show that at low @xmath2 the chiral restoration in the chiral limit ( @xmath13 ) is first- order transition .",
    "it suggests that there exists a tricritical point ( tcp ) where a line of critical point , so called o(4 ) line turns into first - order transition as @xmath12 increases and/or @xmath2 decreases .",
    "if the quark masses are nonzero , there should be a critical end point ( cep ) in the phase diagram of qcd at which the first - order transition line terminates and followed by the crossover when @xmath2 increases or @xmath12 decreases . the positions of cep and tcp of the chiral phase transition have been attracting a lot of interest recently  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the chiral ( scalar ) susceptibility , which stands for a response to the explicit breakdown of chiral symmetry by nonzero @xmath4 and exhibits the pattern of chiral symmetry restoration , is very sensitive to how the qcd vacuum behaves with respect to @xmath4 .",
    "hence , it is of great importance to study @xmath4 dependence for the pattern of chiral restoration in a sophisticated manner .    in this article",
    ", we investigate the pattern of chiral symmetry restoration beyond the chiral limit at finite @xmath2 . for this purpose",
    ", we employ an effective action ( or thermodynamic potential ) derived from the instanton - vacuum configuration  @xcite . from the previous work for @xmath14 , based on an effective chiral action via the instanton - liquid model  @xcite , it turned out that the meson loop corrections ( mlc ) , which correspond to the @xmath3 corrections to leading - order contributions based on mean - field approximations , play a critical role to reproduce appropriate behaviors of the chiral order parameters , such as the scalar susceptibility as a function of @xmath4 . moreover , if and only if mlc is applied properly , the effective quark mass , which originates from s@xmath11sb and relates to the chiral condensate , showed comparable @xmath4 dependences with those obtained by lqcd simulations  @xcite .",
    "because we are interested in computing the chiral order parameters in the presence of nonzero @xmath4 , it is necessary to include mlc in our calculation .",
    "in addition to mlc , we also take into account @xmath2 modifications on the instanton parameters which are average ( anti)instanton size ( @xmath15 ) and inter-(anti)instanton distance ( @xmath16 ) . in vacuum , their values",
    "are estimated phenomenologically as @xmath17 fm and @xmath18 fm , comparable with those from lqcd simulations . following the previous work  @xcite",
    ", we exploit the harrington - shepard caloron , corresponding to the temporally - periodic semi - classic solution of yang - mill s action in euclidean space  @xcite .",
    "the fermionic matsubara formula is also used to evaluate the @xmath2 dependence of the chiral order parameters .",
    "we compute the chiral condensate as a function of @xmath2 and/or @xmath4 , and observe that mlc play an important role to agree with the universality - class behavior of the chiral - restoration patterns in this framework : second - order phase transition in the chiral limit @xmath5 and crossover for @xmath6 . without mlc ,",
    "all the restoration patterns are crossover .",
    "we also find that @xmath7 mev in the chiral limit and @xmath8 mev for @xmath9 mev by using the phenomenological choices for the instanton parameters : @xmath18 fm and @xmath17 fm .",
    "these values of @xmath19 are sensitive to the diluteness of instanton ensemble @xmath20 . within possible deviation of the instanton parameters",
    ", we can obtain values for @xmath19 comparable with those from lqcd simulations .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in section ii , we briefly introduce an effective action derived from the instanton - vacuum configuration , and mlc are added to the saddle - point approximation as the @xmath3 corrections .",
    "all the ingredients discussed in section ii are extended to finite @xmath2 case . for this purpose",
    ", we introduce the harrington - shepard caloron and fermionic matsubara formula . in section iv",
    ", we present and discuss our numerical results for the chiral order parameters as functions of @xmath2 as well as @xmath4 .",
    "the final section is devoted for summary and conclusion .",
    "in this section , we first introduce an effective chiral action derived from the instanton - vacuum configuration , for the leading order of @xmath21  @xcite : @xmath22,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 denote an irrelevant constant for further discussions , instanton number density ( instanton packing fraction ) being equal to @xmath26 , and a lagrangian multiplier to exponentiate the @xmath27-t hooft interacton  @xcite , respectively .",
    "@xmath28 indicates the saddle - point value of an isoscalar - scalar meson field , corresponding to sb@xmath11s , and we ignored other meson contributions here .",
    "the value of @xmath28 will be determined self - consistently by solving saddle - point equations in section iv .",
    "note that this sort of treatment of mesons are equivalent to usual mean - field approximations .",
    "@xmath29 represents a trace over color , flavor , and lorentz indices .",
    "the momentum- and @xmath4-dependent effective quark mass originated from nontrivial quark-(anti)instanton interactions is parameterized as @xmath30 here , @xmath31 and @xmath15 stand for effective the quark mass at zero - momentum transfer and average-(anti)instanton size .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , from the fourier transform of the quark zero - mode solution , the effective quark mass can be written in terms of the modified bessel functions  @xcite . however , we will use the parametrized expression as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mk ] ) for numerical convenience . as indicated in ref .",
    "@xcite , as the momentum transfer goes high enough , the parametrization of the effective quark mass becomes different from eq .",
    "( [ eq : mk ] ) and proportional to @xmath32 .",
    "we verified that there appears only negligible difference from using @xmath33 so that we make use of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mk ] ) for all the momentum - transfer region",
    ". note that in principle @xmath31 is a function of @xmath4 as well as @xmath2 implicitly , as will be shown shortly .",
    "if we consider quantum fluctuations around the saddle - point values of the mesons , we can rewrite the effective action with an additional term , which relates to mlc , indicating @xmath3 corrections of the effective action  @xcite , as follows : @xmath34 \\cr & + & \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{4}\\int\\frac{d^4k}{(2\\pi)^4 } \\ln\\left\\{1-\\frac{1}{4\\sigma^{2 } } \\int\\frac{d^4k}{(2\\pi)^4}\\mathrm{tr } \\left [ \\frac{m_{k}}{\\rlap{/}{k}+i(m_{q}+m_{k})}\\gamma_{i } \\frac{m_{k+q}}{\\rlap{/}{k}+\\rlap{/}{q}+i(m_{q}+m_{k+q } ) } \\gamma_{i}\\right]\\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 relates to the fluctuations from isoscalar - scalar , isoscalar - pseudoscalar , isovector - scalar , and isovector - psuedoscalar mesons . by evaluating over the trace",

    "the coefficient @xmath39 corresponding to each meson is assigned as @xmath40",
    "to investigate the physical quantities at finite @xmath2 , we discuss briefly how to modify the instanton parameters , @xmath15 and @xmath16 at finite temperature .",
    "we will follow our previous work  @xcite and refs .",
    "@xcite to this end .",
    "usually , there are two different instanton configurations at finite @xmath2 , being periodic in euclidean time , with trivial and nontrivial holonomies .",
    "they are called the harrington - shepard  @xcite and kraan - baal - lee - lu calorons  @xcite , respectively .",
    "the nontrivial holonomy can be identified as the polyakov line as an order parameter for the confinement - deconfinement transition of qcd . however , since we are not interested in the confinement - deconfinement phase transition in this work , the harrington - shepard caloron is chosen here for simplicity .    here , we would like to explain our strategy to modify the effective action in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ea2 ] ) as a function of @xmath2 . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the quark zero - mode solution can be obtained directly by solving the dirac equation in the presence of the caloron background . by performing a fourier transform of this zero - mode solution ,",
    "one is lead to an expression for the @xmath2-dependent effective quark mass @xmath41 .",
    "however , in the present work , we choose a simpler way to obtain @xmath41 : since the effective quark mass can be expressed as a function of the instanton parameters , @xmath16 and @xmath42  @xcite , instead of solving the dirac equation directly , we modify @xmath16 and @xmath15 as functions of @xmath2 using the harrington - shepard caloron , resulting in the @xmath2-dependent effective quark mass .",
    "as will be shown , this modification together with mlc , we obtain compatible results with that given in ref .",
