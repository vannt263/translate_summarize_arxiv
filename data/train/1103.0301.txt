    "_ biracks _ were first introduced in @xcite as a generalization of _ racks _ , algebraic structures whose axioms encode blackboard - framed isotopy of oriented knots and links in @xmath1 .",

    "the current term `` rack '' ( without the `` w '' ) is due to fenn and rourke in @xcite , who dropped the `` w '' to denote dropping invariance under writhe - changing type i reidemeister moves .    in @xcite , an integer - valued invariant of knots and links associated to a finite birack @xmath2 known as the _ integral birack counting invariant _",

    "the new invariant is defined for classical and virtual knots and links .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ b ] we review the basics of biracks and the birack counting invariant . in section [ ba ]",
    "we define the birack algebra and give examples of birack modules . in section [ i ]",
    "we use birack modules to enhance the birack counting invariant and give examples to demonstrate that the birack module enhanced invariant is not determined by the jones or alexander polynomials and is strictly stronger than the unenhanced birack counting invariant .",
    "we conclude with a few questions for future research in section [ q ] .",
    "we begin with a definition ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is frequently useful to specify a birack structure on a finite set @xmath5 by listing the operation tables for the components of @xmath6 viewed as binary operations @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "note the reversed order of the operands in @xmath9 ; this is for compatibility with previous work representing these operations as right actions .",
    "then a birack operation @xmath6 on @xmath2 is specified by the @xmath10 matrix @xmath11 $ ] with @xmath12 and @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "conversely , such a matrix specifies a birack structure iff the operation it defines via @xmath16},x_{l[i , j]})\\ ] ] satisfies the birack axioms .    as with other algebraic structures ,",
    "we have the following standard notions :    the birack axioms encode the blackboard - framed reidemeister moves with semiarcs labeled according to the rules below .",
    "@xmath17 at a positive kink , the invertibility properties of @xmath6 define bijections @xmath18 and @xmath19 defined by @xmath20 and @xmath21 which give us the labels on the other semiarcs in a blackboard framed type i move .",
    "@xmath22 the exponent @xmath23 of the bijection @xmath24 , that is , the smallest positive integer @xmath23 satisfying @xmath25 for all @xmath26 , is known as the _ birack rank _ or _",
    "birack characteristic _ of @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath2 is a finite set , then @xmath23 is guaranteed to exist , but infinite biracks may have infinite rank .    @xmath27    a labeling of semiarcs in a framed oriented link diagram with elements of a birack @xmath2 determines a homomorphism @xmath28 if and only if the birack labeling condition is satisfied by the labels in @xmath2 at every crossing .",
    "conversely , every homomorphism @xmath28 determines a unique labeling of the semiarcs of @xmath29 . by construction",
    ", we have the following standard result :    if @xmath29 and @xmath30 are oriented link diagrams which are related by blackboard framed reidemeister moves and @xmath2 is a finite birack , then the sets of labelings of the semiarcs of @xmath29 and @xmath30 by elements of @xmath2 satisfying the birack labeling condition , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , are in bijective correspondence .    thus , the cardinality of the set of birack labelings of an oriented link diagram by a finite birack @xmath2 is a positive integer valued invariant of framed isotopy . to obtain an invariant of unframed ambient isotopy",
    ", we observe as in @xcite that the cardinalities of the sets of birack labelings are periodic in the birack rank @xmath33 since birack labelings are preserved by the _ @xmath23-phone cord move _ : @xmath34    thus , summing these cardinalities over a complete period of framings mod @xmath23 yields an invariant of ambient isotopy known as the _ integral birack counting invariant _ @xmath35 more formally , we have    @xmath36    [ ex1 ] @xmath37 @xmath38    the integral birack counting invariant is also defined for virtual links via the usual technique of ignoring virtual crossings when dividing the link into semiarcs or , equivalently , regarding our virtual link diagrams as being drawn on a surface with sufficient genus to avoid virtual crossings .",
    "we would like to enhance the integral birack counting invariant by finding a way to distinguish between labelings rather than just counting how many total labeling we have . to this end , we will use a scheme analogous to the @xmath40-birack structure to define an associative algebra we call the _ birack algebra _ associated to a finite birack @xmath2 .",

    "* @xmath41 * @xmath42 * @xmath43 * @xmath44 * @xmath45 * @xmath46 * @xmath47    the motivation behind the birack algebra definition is to define secondary labelings of @xmath2-labeled oriented blackboard framed link diagrams with a `` bead '' at every semiarc and to use the @xmath40-birack operations on the beads at a crossing with each @xmath48 and @xmath49 coefficient indexed by the @xmath2-labels on the input strands at a positive crossing and the output strands at a negative crossing . @xmath50",

    "the choice of bead labeling rules guarantees that for every blackboard framed @xmath2-labeled diagram , the number of bead labelings is the same before and after type ii moves and framed type i moves : @xmath51 @xmath52 the other type ii and framed type i cases are similar .",
    "six of the seven birack algebra relations come from the type iii move : @xmath53 comparing coefficients on the output beads @xmath54 and @xmath55 yields the first six relations .",
    "the final birack algebra relation comes from the @xmath23-phone cord move . pushing a bead on a strand labeled with birack element @xmath56 though a positive kink multiplies the bead by @xmath57 ; thus , we need the product of these over a complete period of framings mod @xmath23 to be @xmath58 .    @xmath59.\\ ] ]    @xmath60= \\left[\\begin{array}{cccccccc } t_{2,1 } & -1 & 0 & 0 & s_{2,1 } & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & r_{2,1 } & -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & s_{2,1 } & 0 & 0 & 0 & t_{2,1 } & 0 & -1 \\\\ 0 & r_{2,1 } & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & t_{2,1 } & -1 & 0 & 0 & s_{2,1 } & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & r_{2,1 } & -1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & s_{2,1 } & -1 & 0 & 0 & t_{2,1 } \\\\ -1 & 0 & 0 & r_{2,1 } & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\end{array}\\right]$}\\ ] ]",
