    "the two components of a binary star system raise tides in each other .",
    "these tides will , in general , cause dissipation in the stars , leading to the phenomenon of _ tidal lag_. these lags exert torques which lead to exchange of angular momentum between the orbit and the spins of the stars . the lowest energy configuration , for a given total angular momentum",
    ", is a circular orbit with both spins aligned and synchronous with the orbit .",
    "all other configurations evolve towards the synchronous , circular state . whether or not this is achieved is determined by the rate of dissipation in the tides .",
    "the study of tides raised in celestial bodies by mutual attraction dates back at least to @xcite .",
    "darwin considered the tides raised on the earth , modeled as a homogeneous and deformable _ viscous _ body , by a point mass moon in the weak friction limit ; hence his model is also known as _ weak friction model_. the model assumes that viscous dissipation causes a delay in the onset of the tide by a constant amount @xmath7 so at time @xmath8 the shape of the earth is the one that it would have been at time @xmath9 in the absence of dissipation .",
    "the axis of the tidal bulge is not therefore aligned with the line of the centers of the two bodies but lags it by a constant amount , resulting in a torque that tends to align the two bodies .",
    "modern discussions of the weak friction model , with emphasis on close binary stars rather than planet - satellite systems , are given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that the coupling of the tidal flow with turbulent flows in the envelope of a late type star is chiefly responsible for orbital circularization and synchronization in these stars ; evidence of circularization due to tidal interactions in late type giants is found by @xcite .",
    "the theory has been more recently revised by @xcite and compared against observations by @xcite who found that for late type stars most of the circularization occurs during the hayashi phase of pre main sequence evolution , as previously suggested by @xcite .",
    "the circularization models cited above consider only the _ equilibrium tide _ which arises if the star is at all times in hydrostatic equilibrium . if , however , the orbit is not circular or the rotation is not synchronous the star is subjected to a time - varying gravitational potential which excites oscillations , giving rise to a _ dynamical tide _ superimposed on the equilibrium tide . forced oscillations in binary stars were first considered by @xcite and then by @xcite ; @xcite considered the damping of the dynamical tide by radiative dissipation in the radiative envelope as a possible circularization mechanism for early type stars ; @xcite studied a sample of @xmath10 early type binary stars and showed the theory to be compatible with the data presented .",
    "these mechanisms are all described in @xcite , where time scales of circularization and synchronization are derived .",
    "a circularization mechanism in which energy dissipation is due to large scale hydro - dynamical flows resulting from the deformation of the star ( meridional circulation ) has been proposed by tassoul @xcite .",
    "this model has been applied by @xcite to a homogeneous sample of 45 eclipsing binary stars ( ebs ) with accurate parameter determination from @xcite : they find a satisfactory agreement with the observations and also find that circularization is still taking place during the main sequence for early - type ebs , a finding consistent with the results of this paper .",
    "@xcite then apply both the turbulent dissipation mechanism and the radiative damping mechanism to the same @xcite data set .",
    "they find that within uncertainties , these formalisms seem able to explain the observed eccentricity distribution , although with a few exceptions .",
    "since tidal forces decrease and the period increases with separation , in a sample of coeval binary stars such as those in star clusters , binaries with a longer period should have orbits with a range of eccentricities since tidal forces have not circularized them yet , whereas binaries with a shorter period should all have circular orbits since tidal forces would have been more effective in circularizing them . therefore clusters should show a transition between binaries with shorter period and circular orbits and binaries with longer periods and eccentric orbits ; the values of this transition period varies with the age of the cluster .",
    "binary stars in cluster are widely studied : for example as a part of the wiyn open cluster study ( wocs ) , ] a systematic search of ebs in milky way open clusters for testing orbital circularization theories is currently under way @xcite . @xcite present spectroscopic orbital solutions for @xmath11 single - lined stars from their catalog @xcite of @xmath12 stars selected for high proper motion and",
    "find that for the metal poor , high velocity halo binary stars in their sample the transition from circular to eccentric orbits occurs at @xmath13 .",
    "binary systems in which the component stars eclipse each other are a powerful tool for the study of circularization theories since in this case both _",
    "stellar _ parameters like radius , mass , and temperature , and _",
    "orbital _ parameters like eccentricity , angle of inclination , and longitude of periastron , can be determined to the accuracy necessary to test different theories . to determine these parameters",
    "fully one needs to supplement the photometric data with high quality spectra , which can be used to determine orbital velocities .",
    "eclipsing binary stars have been found in large numbers by astronomical surveys studying gravitational microlensing : macho , ogle ] and eros . in particular a sample of @xmath14 ebs in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and of @xmath15 ebs in the small magellanic cloud",
    "@xcite have just been published by the macho collaboration .",
    "previously a catalogue of @xmath16 ebs in the lmc @xcite and of @xmath17 ebs in the smc @xcite were published by the ogle collaboration , the ebs were selected from their catalogue of variable stars in the magellanic clouds @xcite compiled from observations taken during the second part of the project ( ogle - ii : * ? ? ?",
    "a catalogue of 611 ebs in the lmc @xcite , and of @xmath6 ebs in the bar of the lmc @xcite were also published by the macho and eros collaboration respectively .",
    "this earlier macho sample is contained in the new one .",
    "we aim to take advantage of the sheer size of our samples to infer statistically valid conclusions on orbital circularization , even though our data do not have high photometric precision and there are no spectroscopic data .",
    "we exploit a simple idea : the phase difference between the primary and secondary minima in an eb light curve , @xmath18 , may be effectively estimated for the light curves in our samples .",
    "this object is related to the orbital elements by the following equation , which sets a _",
    "lower bound _ to the eccentricity @xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath18 is the phase difference between primary and secondary minima , @xmath20 is the eccentricity , @xmath21 is the argument of periastron and @xmath22 is the orbital inclination . for eclipsing systems , especially the wider systems where non zero eccentricities are found , we know that @xmath23 .",
    "the important degeneracy is between @xmath21 and @xmath20 .",
    "it is possible _ in principle _ to model high signal - to - noise photometric data to break this degeneracy @xcite but we do not attempt this here . we will show that @xmath18 alone may be used for our purpose .",
    "although eq .",
    "[ eq : ecc ] shows that for an eccentric orbit @xmath18 can be either @xmath24 or @xmath25 , depending on @xmath26 , we will always adopt the convention @xmath27 since only the deviation of @xmath18 from @xmath28 is relevant for the detection of eccentricity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : obs ] describes both the macho and the ogle - ii samples for both clouds ; section [ sec : fit ] describes the fits to the macho data and its validity ( for the ogle - ii data the relevant information is provided by the authors ) ; section [ sec : results ] reports our results for both clouds both from the macho and the ogle - ii samples ; section [ sec : sig ] discusses the significance of our results and eros results are briefly considered in subsection [ subsec : eros ] .",
    "finally section [ sec : conclusion ] states our conclusions .",
    "the data presented in this paper can be accessed on line at the astrophysical journal website and are mirrored at the harvard university initiative in innovative computing ( iic ) /time series center .    from now on we will always use the term _ unfolded light curve _ to indicate a set of time ordered observations and will reserve the term _ light curve _ to indicate a set of time ordered observations _ folded _ around a period , omitting for brevity the adjectives `` folded '' or `` phased '' .",
    "the macho project was an astronomical survey whose primary aim was to detect gravitational microlensing events of background stars by compact objects in the halo of the milky way .",
    "the background stars were located in the lmc , smc and the bulge of the milky way ; more details on the detection of microlensing events can be found in @xcite and references therein .",
    "observations were carried out from july 1992 to december 1999 with the dedicated @xmath29 telescope of mount stromlo , australia , using a @xmath30 mosaic of @xmath31 ccd in two band passes simultaneously . these are called macho  blue \" , hereafter indicated with @xmath32 , with a bandpass of @xmath33 and macho  red \" , hereafter indicated with @xmath34 , with a bandpass of @xmath35 ; transformations to standard johnson @xmath36 and cousins @xmath37 bands are described in detail in @xcite ; the magnitudes quoted in this paper have been obtained by using the following transformation for the lmc : @xmath38 and the following one for the smc : @xmath39 the zero point in eq .",
    "[ eq : smcmachocal ] is different from the one in eq .",
    "[ eq : machocal ] because of the different exposure times for lmc and smc @xcite .",
    "there are several hundreds of observations in both band passes for most ebs ; the central fields of the lmc were observed more frequently than the periphery and there are on average fewer observations in the red band because one half of one of the red ccds was out of commission during part of the project .    for each source in the database found to be variable @xcite a period was found using the supersmoother algorithm ( * ? ? ?",
    "* first published by @xcite ) .",
    "the algorithm folds the unfolded light curve around different trial periods and selects the one that gives the smoothest light curve .",
    "periods were found separately for the red and blue unfolded light curve and they usually agree to high accuracy ( @xmath40 on average ) ; unfolded light curves were then folded around these periods @xcite .",
    "the ogle - ii data we considered comprise the lmc sample of @xmath16 ebs described in @xcite of which @xmath2 were also present in our sample , and the smc sample of @xmath17 ebs described in @xcite of which @xmath5 were also present in our sample .",
    "the available data include the phase of secondary minimum @xmath41 ( the phase of primary minimum is set to @xmath42 ) , the period , and @xmath43 , @xmath36 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 magnitudes at maximum light .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we used both @xmath44 and @xmath45 magnitudes in our analysis .",
    "the phase of the secondary @xmath41 is given up to two decimal places .",
    "to find the phases of minima for the macho samples the light curves have been fitted to a sum of sines and cosines : @xmath46 where @xmath47 are the instrumental macho magnitudes , @xmath32 and @xmath34 in which the fits have been carried out and @xmath48 is the orbital phase for the light curves .",
    "we preferred instrumental macho magnitudes because in many cases observations in _",
    "one _ of the macho bands are invalid , thus forcing us to exclude these points in the fit for _ both _ bands if standard magnitudes had been used .",
    "the `` frequencies '' @xmath49 have been found with the lomb periodogram technique @xcite ; this method is not a fourier decomposition because the frequencies are not in a harmonic series ; furthermore , the data are not uniformly spaced in phase . before fitting ,",
    "outlying points in the light curves have been eliminated using moving windows with roughly @xmath50 ( where @xmath51 is the number of points in the light curve ) points , calculating their mean and standard deviation and excluding from the fit points that are @xmath52 standard deviations away from the mean in each window .",
    "figure [ fig : sinlc ] shows some examples of sinusoidal fits and data on these objects are shown in table [ tab : lc ] .",
    "the phasing was performed using the red and blue periods for the red and blue bands respectively .",
    "the number of frequencies calculated by the lomb periodogram varies from object to object , but in most cases is in the range @xmath53 .    one problem of sinusoidal fit is that it tends to underestimate the depth of the minima for deep , widely separated eclipses ; in general this fit works better for tidally distorted systems and less well for widely detached systems .",
    "therefore , after performing the sinusoidal fit , the light curves were also fitted to a sum of two gaussians , which often better represent detached systems .",

    "these residuals were divided by the macho estimated photometric errors @xmath58 to create scaled residuals @xmath59 .",
    "the cumulative distribution of the @xmath60 was sampled randomly and used to create the synthetic noise at phase @xmath54 , @xmath61 .",
    "the new , synthetic , noisy light curve was then @xmath62 .",
    "we determined the quantity @xmath18 for this light curve , and the entire procedure was repeated @xmath63  30 times in each band .",
    "we excluded the cases in which @xmath64 ( as we did in the real fits ) which we took as an indication that the fitting procedure had failed .",
    "the rms of the deviations from @xmath18 determined from the macho data is a reasonable estimate of the error in this procedure .",
    "figure [ fig : errhist ] shows the histograms of the errors thus defined for both bands ; most errors are smaller than @xmath65 making our method for detecting eccentricities very robust .",
    "we then studied the effects of period uncertainties on our method .",
    "a small period uncertainty should manifest itself as a constant shift in the phases of a light curve : therefore we selected a random subsample of @xmath66 ebs , created simulated light curves in the same way but in addition we added a constant random phase shift to them and repeated the procedure .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : errhistrandomphase ] which shows that our method is also robust with respect to uncertainties in the period determination .    in the few cases where our procedure gives a large error estimate the reason is mostly the presence of one or two shallow minima and/or noise in the light curve . in the presence of a very shallow eclipse a small perturbation of the data",
    "can lead to a large difference in the determination of one or both phases of the minima and therefore a large variance used to estimate the error in phase difference ; this is true also for noisy data .",

    "these subsamples were selected with a color cut whose exact definition depends on the eb sample ( see below ) , and with the same cuts in @xmath115 and @xmath143 as the all ages subsamples defined above and their colors were again compared via a ks test .",
    "we call these subsamples the _ young eb subsamples _ because the color cut ensures that they contain only young and unevolved stars that only recently settled on the main sequence",
    ". table [ tab : kstest ] summarizes the properties of these subsamples ; as the numbers show all subsamples are large enough for the ks test to be safely employed @xcite ; the values of the ks statistic @xmath144 for all subsamples are reported in table [ tab : kstest2 ] .",
    "the data reported in table [ tab : kstest2 ] allow us to draw the main conclusion of this work , which hold for both clouds , namely :    1 .",
    "there is a significant probability for the two young eb subsamples of being drawn from the same color distribution .",
    "the probability for the all ages subsamples of being drawn from the same distribution of colors is vanishingly small .",
    "these two findings allow us to state that , in both clouds , ebs start their lives with a broad distribution of orbital eccentricities and circularize their orbits as their evolve on and past the main sequence .",
    "this result is consistent with @xcite who find that , in their sample of @xmath145 spectroscopic binaries , long period systems with late type giant components have mostly circular orbits ; @xcite suggest that tidal interactions due to expansion after the main sequence phase of one or both components is responsible for their circular orbit .",
    "we note finally that the use of the @xmath112 cut in the ogle - ii samples gives results slightly more consistent with the results we obtain from the macho samples than the use of the @xmath135 cut , although our conclusion does not qualitatively change . for this reason in the histograms of figures [ fig : coldist ] and [ fig : coldistcmdcutoff ]",

    "this could result in an eb being erroneously selected as `` young '' by the color cuts described above , whereas the system is actually in a more advanced stage of evolution and biasing our conclusions .",
    "we assessed the possible significance of this effect by fitting the @xmath36 light curves of the macho lmc ebs selected with the @xmath190 cut , with with and without a third light as a free fit parameter ; we then did the same for the smc with the @xmath191 cut .",
    "if the @xmath36 band light curve fit improves considerably by using a third light as a free fit parameter , this means that an undetected blue third star is present ; such system should therefore be excluded from the ks tests because the binary system is actually redder and probably more evolved than its @xmath101 suggests .",
    "we point out that the only aim of these fits is to assess the significance of a possible undetected blue third star , and not to determine any physical parameters for the ebs .",
    "since the systems we are dealing with are unevolved we expect them to be detached and therefore to be well described by the ebop model @xcite .",
    "we actually performed the fits using the jktebop ] @xcite code , based on ebop and which adds several modifications and extensions that make it easier to use , especially when fitting a large number of light curves .",
    "we obtained preliminary starting values for the fit parameters using the debil ] code @xcite , a fitting code suited to automatically analyze large numbers of detached ebs .",
    "we then refined the fits using jktebop ; this was done by performing a first fit using the parameters computed by debil as starting values , then eliminating those points at least @xmath192 standard deviations away from this first fit and redoing the fit ; this second step allowed in many cases to considerably improve the quality of the fit by excluding outlying points .",
    "we used the following criterion to quantify whether or not the quality of the fit improved as a result of fitting for a third light .",
    "the typical number of points in the blue macho light curves is @xmath193 for the lmc and @xmath194 for the smc and the number of fit parameters is @xmath195 ; we therefore assumed a typical number of degrees of freedom ( dof ) for our fits of @xmath196 .",
    "for @xmath196 dof , the probability of getting @xmath197 by chance is @xmath198 whereas the probability of getting @xmath199 by chance is @xmath200 .",
    "therefore , if for a @xmath36 light curve we have @xmath201 without fitting for a third light and @xmath202 by fitting for it , we conclude that a blue third object is present ; the ebs is then excluded by the young eb subsamples and the ks tests are performed again on them .",

    "we considered the sample of @xmath6 ebs in the bar of the lmc found by the eros collaboration @xcite .",
    "we cross correlated this sample with both the macho sample , finding @xmath210 matches , and with the ogle - ii sample finding @xmath211 matches ; therefore this sample overlaps only partly with the two larger samples and we performed the same analysis described above , finding comparable results , despite much lower number statistic . of the @xmath6 ebs in the sample we selected , in the @xmath138 period range , @xmath212 ebs with circular orbits and @xmath213 ebs with eccentric orbits .",
    "we then applied the ks test to the distributions of the @xmath43 magnitudes for these two samples , since , despite their small size , the test can still be used @xcite .",
