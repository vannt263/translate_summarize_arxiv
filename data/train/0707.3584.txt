    "this paper addresses two issues of contemporary interest in the field of ad hoc network capacity .",
    "first , we characterize the effect of random channel variations , due both to shadowing / fading and to random distances between transmitter  receiver pairs .",
    "second , this paper considers the effect of local channel state information , namely through pairwise scheduling and power control . through analysis",
    "we are able to obtain asymptotically tight lower and upper bounds on the transmission capacity .",
    "we anchor our discussion around three examples : lognormal shadowing , rayleigh fading , and nearest neighbor transmissions ( in a poisson field ) .",
    "although fading without any channel state information ( csi ) is shown to decrease capacity , fading might in fact enable an increase in capacity if it can be exploited . to investigate this we consider two simple ways to utilize local csi : channel inversion power control and threshold  based scheduling .",
    "both mechanisms require coordination only between each transmitter and its intended receiver , i.e. , no coordination between transmitters is required . because the transmission capacity definition includes a universal sinr target",
    ", it may seem intuitive that channel inversion would be helpful , by saving power ( and hence interference ) from privileged links , and by providing assistance to underprivileged links to help them to avoid outage .",
    "however , we prove that although channel inversion power control may help an individual link and does promote fairness , it lowers the network capacity as a whole .",
    "next , we characterize the potentially significant positive capacity impact of exploiting csi for threshold  based scheduling . in particular , each transmitter elects to transmit only if the channel to its receiver is acceptably strong .",
    "our results demonstrate that this simple scheduling rule provides significant capacity gains in a completely distributed manner . in effect , the threshold rule introduces _ multi - user diversity _ into the network by activating only those links with acceptable channel quality . a scientific contribution of this paper relative",
    "to prior work on ad hoc network scheduling is a novel framework for concisely and explicitly characterizing the effect of fading and scheduling in terms of the network and system parameters .",
    "some simplifying assumptions made in this paper are as follows .",
    "first , we assume narrowband fading , i.e. , each channel is affected by a single scalar gain .",
    "second , transmissions are slotted in time and multiple hop communication is not explicitly considered .",
    "the goal of the considered framework is to quantify the maximum number of simultaneous successful transmissions per unit area ; how these transmissions are used as far as routing packets over multiple hops is presently outside its scope .",
    "third , we ignore retransmissions , which will reduce the effective network capacity .",
    "finally , we assume that candidate transmitters are randomly located independent of one another , in particular according to a homogeneous poisson point process .",
    "the rest of our modeling assumptions are given in section [ sec:3 ] .      throughout the paper",
    "we will employ _ transmission capacity _ ( tc ) as the primary performance metric .",
    "the tc was introduced in @xcite , and is defined as the maximum number of successful communication links that can be accommodated per unit area , subject to a specified constraint on the outage probability ( op ) relative to a target signal to interference ratio ( sir ) .",
    "tc therefore quantifies the area spectral efficiency in an ad hoc network from an outage perspective .",
    "a particular advantage of the tc framework is its amenability to precise analysis .",
    "this allows the impact of physical layer effects ( like fading ) on link layer scheduling policies to be more precisely characterized .",
    "recently the tc has been employed to characterize capacity in a variety of scenarios , e.g. , coverage @xcite , the capacity of irregular ad hoc networks @xcite , successive interference cancellation @xcite , or for better understanding of contention - based scheduling @xcite .",
    "in addition to ad hoc networks , the transmission capacity is also an appropriate metric for general open spectrum usage ( e.g. , wi - fi , cognitive radio ) where many ( non - cooperative ) transmitter - receiver pairs operate in the same frequency band .    in @xcite , the transmission capacity of an ad hoc network",
    "is studied for a network with path loss attenuation ( no fading ) , fixed transmission power , and aloha  style transmission attempts .",
    "in such a network the only source of randomness is the locations of the transmitters , modeled as a homogeneous poisson process .",
    "an outage occurs whenever the sinr falls below an sinr threshold @xmath3 ; in this simple setup the transmission capacity is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the fixed distance between each transmitter - receiver pair and @xmath6 is the path loss exponent .",
    "note that @xmath7 has units of expected number of successful transmissions per unit area .",
    "* relationship to transport capacity . * the _ transmission capacity _ ( tc )",
    "is closely related to the popular _ transport capacity _ metric introduced by gupta and kumar @xcite .",
    "the transport capacity is defined as the maximum weighted sum rate of communication over all pairs of @xmath8 nodes , where each pair s communication rate is weighted by the distance separating them .",
    "a number of papers have studied transport capacity from an information theoretic perspective @xcite , and the best result to date has shown that the transport capacity is @xmath9 when nodes have a minimum distance separating them and the path loss exponent obeys @xmath10 .",
    "this minimum distance means that the area required for @xmath8 nodes is also @xmath11 . as both transport capacity and the arena area",
    "are linear in @xmath8 it follows that @xmath12 .",
    "that is , the transport capacity per unit area is a constant , and has units of bit - meters / second per unit area .",
    "the importance of this result is that @xmath0 the transport capacity per unit area is independent of the number of nodes ( for @xmath8 large ) , and @xmath1 local ( one hop ) communication is order optimal .",
    "the transmission capacity can be converted into units of bit - meters / second per unit area by simply multiplying by the product of the average transmission rate times the average transmission distance . in the outage",
    "setting considered here successful transmissions have rate @xmath13 ( bps ) and transmissions have a mean distance @xmath5 ( meters ) .",
    "it follows that the transmission capacity is @xmath14 in units of bit - meters / second per unit area .",
    "we can write @xmath15 to emphasize that the transmission capacity is order optimal , and thus order equivalent to the transport capacity throughput scaling of multi - hop , which essentially corresponds to linear scaling of transport capacity in an extended network , can actually be exceeded for path loss exponents between 2 and 3 @xcite . as a result , transmission capacity corresponds to an achievable rate that is not order ",
    "optimal for @xmath16 , but maximizing this quantity is still meaningful because multi - hop is currently the prevalent means of communication in ad hoc networks . ] .",
    "this constant depends upon the fundamental network parameters such as @xmath17 , as well as the particular technologies that are assumed , e.g. successive interference cancellation , csi , power control , etc .",
    "the contribution of the transport capacity framework is to prove optimality and achievability of @xmath18 bit - meters / second per unit area for as wide a class of networks as possible . because transport capacity seeks to make as few assumptions as possible regarding network behavior , the lower and",
    "upper constants obtained in proving the result are given only in terms of the path loss exponent and the minimum distance between nodes ( see e.g. , ( 8.1 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the density of the network is not explicitly considered in works that have developed upper bounds to transport capacity scaling .",
    "our interest , on the other hand , is in determining the value of the unknown constant for various networks and transmission strategies ( i.e. , achievability schemes ) of practical interest .",
    "the two metrics arise from distinct aims : transmission capacity aims to study the performance of a specific network ( and gives performance expressions in terms of those specific model parameters ) , while transport capacity aims at establishing fundamental bounds over a broad class of networks .      )",
    "is above a specified threshold . in channel inversion power control",
    "the transmitter selects a transmission power such that the received power is a specified value ( here , @xmath19).,width=336 ]    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab:1 ]      we consider a general class of channel models consisting of a deterministic distance - dependent path loss component with path loss exponent @xmath6 , and a random distance - independent component .",
    "in particular , let @xmath20 be the far - field attenuation in signal power over a distance @xmath5 with a channel gain @xmath21 .",
    "the distance independent channel gain , @xmath21 , is assumed to be independent across channels and independent of the node position .",
    "note that this model has a singularity as @xmath22 ; this matter is discussed in some detail in @xcite and @xcite . because we consider the network from an outage perspective , such a singularity has only a negligible effect on our results .",
    "for example , if an interferer is very close to a receiver , the above channel model would lead to an artificially small sir .",
    "however , the receiver would very likely be in outage even if the singularity was removed , and thus there is no effect on the outage probability .",
    "furthermore , we assume the distribution on transmitter ",
    "receiver pair separation distances precludes the possibility of nearby transmitter  receiver pairs .",
    "although the singularity at the origin is not physically meaningful , it turns out that retaining the singularity significantly simplifies the analysis without materially affecting the numerical and simulation results . as explained further in the numerical and simulation results section ( section [ sec:6 ] ) , for purposes of analysis we will retain the singularity ( @xmath23 ) , but all our simulation results will employ @xmath24 .",
    "our results will illustrate that the results are essentially unaffected by the singularity .    for simplicity and analytical tractability",
    "we ignore background thermal noise . in an interference limited network",
    "the noise contribution is minimal .",
    "our earlier work @xcite contained models with additive noise , and it was shown there was no appreciable effect unless the network was extremely sparse .",
    "of course , it is straightforward to numerically verify this claim .",
    "we study network performance both with and without channel inversion . in the absence of channel inversion",
    "we assume that unit power is employed ; this results in no loss of generality because in the absence of additive noise increasing the power linearly increases both the signal and interference , leaving the sir unaffected . under channel inversion",
    "each transmitter employs a power @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the channel gain connecting the transmitter with its intended receiver ; this results in unit signal power at the intended receiver .",
    "the impact of channel inversion on link layer performance for poisson distributed transmitters is also addressed by baccelli _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "consider a large ad hoc network , where the locations of _ potential _ transmitters at a typical point in time form a stationary poisson point process ( ppp ) @xmath27 on the plane @xmath28 .",
    "the spatial density of the point process is denoted by @xmath29 , giving the average number of potential transmitters per unit area .",
    "we also assume that each potential transmitter , @xmath30 , has an associated intended receiver ( not in @xmath31 ) , and we let the index @xmath30 refer to the pair consisting of transmitter @xmath30 and its associate receiver @xmath30 . the assumption that each potential transmitter has a receiver that is not a potential transmitter precludes the possibility of collisions where a transmitter attempts to communicate with another node that is already transmitting .",
    "let @xmath32 denote the random channel gain for the channel between the transmitter of pair @xmath30 and the receiver of pair @xmath33 .",
    "the channel gains are independent across both receivers ( @xmath32 is independent of @xmath34 ) , and across transmitters ( @xmath35 is independent of @xmath36 ) .",
    "let @xmath37 be the common distribution for the channel gains .",
    "let @xmath38 represent the distance between the transmitter and intended receiver of pair @xmath30 ; the distances @xmath39 are assumed to be iid with common distribution @xmath40 . as discussed in the introduction ,",
    "we restrict our attention to transmission policies where each transmitter s decision is made independent of the other transmitter decisions .",
    "it follows that the relevant state information for each transmitter @xmath30 s decision is the pair @xmath41 describing the channel with its intended receiver .",
    "our attention will focus on a ( typical ) reference receiver , without loss of generality assumed to be located at the origin , @xmath42 .",
    "the reference receiver and its associated transmitter are pair number @xmath43 .",
    "it follows that the performance will depend upon not only each pair s channel information ( dictating which transmitters will elect to transmit ) , but also upon the channel information connecting each transmitter with the reference receiver at the origin ( dictating the typical receiver performance ) .",
    "we encode all this state information by forming the _ marked _ poisson point process ( mppp ) @xmath44 let @xmath45 denote the distance from each transmitter @xmath30 to the reference receiver at the origin .    the ppp @xmath46 denotes the set of actual interferers at the typical time under consideration .",
    "because the transmission decisions are made independently across transmitters and independent of their locations , it follows that @xmath47 is also a stationary mppp , albeit with a smaller intensity , denoted as @xmath48 .",
    "we discuss transmission decision rules for obtaining @xmath47 from @xmath31 in sections [ sec:4 ] ( using random transmission decisions ) and [ sec:5 ] ( using threshold based transmission decisions ) . rather than work with the sir we will instead work with its inverse , @xmath49 , which can be thought of as the aggregate co - channel interference power normalized by the signal power .",
    "the normalized aggregate interference seen at the reference receiver is @xmath50 where @xmath51 are the transmission powers employed .",
    "the sir seen at the reference receiver is therefore @xmath52      three performance metrics are studied in this paper : the outage probability , the spatial throughput , and the transmission capacity .",
    "* outage probability . * a reception is assumed successful provided the sir seen at the receiver exceeds a specified @xmath53 , with an outage resulting if this condition is not satisfied .",
    "let @xmath54 denote the probability of outage when the intensity of attempted transmissions is @xmath55 : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the isr requirement .",
    "the sir - based outage probability introduced above corresponds very simply to achievability in the information theoretic sense .",
    "if all nodes are assumed to transmit gaussian symbols and the channel is narrowband , the mutual information between the transmitting ( @xmath58 ) and receiving node ( @xmath59 ) is given by : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the sir seen by receiver @xmath30 .",
    "since only the term @xmath62 is considered , an implicit assumption is that multi - user interference is treated as noise ( interference can be cancelled , see @xcite ) . mutual information , or rate ,",
    "is measured conditioned on channel conditions , node locations , the instantaneous set of transmitters , and the fading coefficients .",
    "thus , the quantity in ( [ eqn : j ] ) measures the rate of reliable information flow from @xmath58 to @xmath59 at a snapshot of the network .",
    "of course , this mutual information expression is only meaningful if the conditioning variables are fixed during transmission .",
    "most importantly , this requires that the time scale of fading be larger than packet durations .    in the outage formulation ,",
    "the instantaneous mutual information is treated as a random variable ( a function of random interferer locations and channel conditions ) and an outage occurs whenever this random variable falls below the desired rate of communication .",
    "thus , for rate @xmath63 the outage probability is given by @xmath64 . since there is a one - to - one mapping between mutual information and sir in this expression , outage",
    "can equivalently be stated in terms of sir , as in ( [ eqn : i ] ) with @xmath65 .",
    "* spatial throughput . *",
    "the spatial throughput is the expected spatial density of successful transmissions : @xmath66 i.e. , the product of the attempted transmission intensity ( @xmath55 ) times the average probability of success ( @xmath67 ) .    *",
    "transmission capacity .",
    "* the spatial throughput often obscures the fact that high throughput is sometimes obtained at the expense of unacceptably high outage .",
    "this is especially important in ad hoc networks as wasted transmissions both cause unnecessary interference for other nodes and they waste precious energy . as a simple example of high throughput achieved through high outage , note that classic slotted aloha has a throughput of the form @xmath68 , which is maximized for an attempt rate of @xmath69 .",
    "the optimal throughput at @xmath69 is @xmath70 , but the outage probability is @xmath71 .",
    "thus @xmath72 of all attempted transmissions must fail to achieve the optimal throughput . for many important network applications , e.g. , streaming media , high levels of outage are unacceptable , and as such it is desirable that the network operate in a low outage regime . with this in mind , we define the _ optimal contention density _ , @xmath73 , as the maximum spatial density of _ attempted _ transmissions such that the corresponding outage probability is @xmath74 $ ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath75 serves as a proxy for network quality of service .",
    "the optimal contention density is found by solving @xmath76 for @xmath77 , i.e. , @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the inverse of ( [ eqn : i ] ) .",
    "having found the optimal contention density , we define the _ transmission capacity _ as the corresponding spatial density of _ successful _ transmissions , @xmath80 the advantage of the transmission capacity framework is that it yields the maximum throughput that can be obtained subject to a maximum permissible outage probability , i.e. , a qos requirement .",
    "in this section we present analytical results for the performance metrics introduced in section [ ssec:3c ] when transmission decisions are made randomly ; performance results with threshold scheduling decisions are given in section [ sec:5 ] .",
    "under randomized transmissions the set of actual transmitters , @xmath47 , is obtained from the set of possible transmitters , @xmath31 , by each node electing to transmit at random with probability @xmath81 , for any desired @xmath48 .",
    "we provide analytical results for performance with fixed ( unit ) power ( section [ ssec:4a ] ) and with channel inversion ( section [ ssec:4b ] ) , and then provide detailed discussion ( section [ ssec:4d ] ) as well as examples ( section [ ssec:4c ] ) .",
    "looking at the three performance metrics in section [ ssec:3c ] it is apparent that they each depend upon the distribution of @xmath82 in ( [ eqn : h ] ) . in the absence of channel inversion , the normalized aggregate interference seen by the reference receiver is @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the received signal power .",
    "because transmission decisions are made by each node at random ( independent of the channel state ) , it follows that each node electing to transmit has @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is expressible in terms of the known distributions @xmath37 and @xmath40 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath82 may be expressed in terms of the distribution of @xmath82 conditioned on @xmath84 : @xmath87    previous work by ilow and hatzinakos @xcite has characterized the conditional distribution @xmath88 as a stable distribution .",

    "note that due to fading , a dominant interferer need not correspond to the nearest interferer .",
    "indeed , considering only the contribution of the nearest interferer gives a weaker bound .",
    "the upper bound @xmath105 is obtained by application of the chebychev inequality .",

    "* the impact of the random channel fading gains , @xmath106 , and the random distances separating transmitters and receivers , @xmath39 , on the asymptotic ccdf bounds in ( [ eqn : s_lower])-([eqn : s ] ) is confined to the fractional moments @xmath107\\mathbb{e}[\\psi^{-\\delta } ] \\mathbb{e}[d^2]$ ] . since the asymptotic lower bound is tight in most scenarios of interest , as explained in further detail below , the fractional moments are generally able to completely capture the effect of fading and random distances .",

    "this is in fact a viable approach in theory , although it is often not computationally feasible .",
    "an upper bound using the chernoff bound instead of the chebychev bound is developed in the appendix , along with a discussion of the associated computational obstacles .",
    "* tightness of the lower bound . *",
    "the lower bound is tight as @xmath100 , i.e. , as one moves further along the tail of the distribution of @xmath82 ( also corresponding to @xmath110 ) .",

    "a similar comment holds for theorem [ thm:3 ] and corollary [ cor:3 ] .",
    "note that the bounds in theorems [ thm:2 ] and [ thm:3 ] require evaluating an integral , while the bounds in corollaries [ cor:2 ] and [ cor:3 ] only require evaluating a constant .",
    "the intuition for this difference is quite straightforward . without channel inversion , the marks of the poisson process in ( [ eqn : m ] )",

    "thus channel inversion strictly increases the lower bound on outage probability . the intuition for this increase appears to come from the difference in the normalized interference expressions with and without channel inversion in ( [ eqn : aa ] ) and ( [ eqn : m ] ) , respectively .",
    "with channel inversion , the reference receiver is vulnerable to signal fades of _ any _ of its nearby interferers ( i.e. , small values of @xmath131 ) ; without channel inversion , the reference receiver is vulnerable only to a fade on its own channel @xmath84 .",

    "this effect does not appear in our sir - based analysis , but we note that this effect is less pronounced when channel inversion is combined with threshold scheduling in section [ ssec:5b ] because the threshold eliminates small values of @xmath131 and thus decreases the difference between @xmath129 $ ] and @xmath154}$ ] .",
    "one positive effect of channel inversion is that it assists with fairness .",
    "if the distance between a transmitter - receiver pair is large compared to the average and/or the channel gain coefficient is small , the outage probability of this pair would be considerably higher than the network - wide average without channel inversion .",

    "what our results show is that there is a quantifiable network - wide penalty for doing so . + * effect of random distance and fading . * in order to understand the effect of random tx - rx distance and fading , it is useful to rewrite the expression for the transmission capacity upper bound @xmath155 for a power - controlled system given in ( [ eqn : ag ] ) : @xmath156 \\mathbb{e}[\\psi^{-\\delta } ] \\mathbb{e}[d^2]},\\label{eq : tc - approx}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used @xmath157 for small values of @xmath75 . ) , transmitter to receiver distances are fixed ( @xmath158 ) , and @xmath75 is small , ( [ eq : tc - approx ] ) recovers the tc given in theorem 1 in @xcite , which describes the tc of a network in which there is only path - loss . ]",
    "although this bound holds for channel inversion power controlled systems , it is also extremely accurate for systems using fixed transmission power when @xmath75 is small because the asymptotically tight ( i.e. , for @xmath159 ) outage lower bound given in ( [ eqn : s_lower ] ) leads to the same transmission capacity upper bound stated above .",

    "@xmath164 in ( [ eqn : ae ] ) is strictly larger under random @xmath163 than under deterministic @xmath163 , and thus fading reduces transmission capacity under randomized transmissions with channel inversion .",

    "therefore , it is safe to say that signal fading can have a rather significant negative effect on transmission capacity , while interference fading leads to a less significant positive effect .",
    "if the fading distributions are identical , then ( [ eqn : aj ] ) indicates that the net effect of fading is negative .    the optimal transmission probability to maximize the spatial throughput upper bound @xmath187 in ( [ eqn : af ] ) is @xmath188 , and thus the bound optimal intensity of transmission attempts is @xmath189 .",

    "the other three plots show simulation results for the four cases discussed in the paper : randomized transmissions with and without channel inversion , and threshold transmissions with and without channel inversion .",
    "the three plots are of outage probability @xmath309 versus transmission probability @xmath115 , spatial throughput @xmath311 versus @xmath115 , and the transmission capacity @xmath319 versus the outage requirement @xmath75 .    several observations merit comment .",
    "first , note that as @xmath320 ( as @xmath321 ) channel inversion has no impact on performance , while as @xmath320 ( as @xmath321 ) randomized and threshold transmissions have identical performance .",
    "the limited impact of channel inversion is especially apparent for threshold transmissions : for large @xmath232 ( small @xmath115 ) only potential transmitters with good channels elect to transmit , and thus there is less need for using channel inversion to compensate for poor channels compared with smaller @xmath232 ( larger @xmath115 ) . for large @xmath115 ( small @xmath232 )",
    "employing thresholds is increasingly ineffective in restricting transmissions to nodes with good channels , and as such becomes equivalent to randomized transmissions .",
    "second , as discussed in the comments of section [ sec:4 ] and [ sec:5 ] , channel inversion always reduces performance ( larger @xmath309 , smaller @xmath311 , smaller @xmath319 ) .",
    "as discussed , channel inversion is a compensation mechanism allowing nodes with poor channels to their receivers to obtain acceptable received signal power .",
    "although nodes with good channels reduce their power and hence decrease the amount of interference they cause , the net effect is undesirable .",
    "the intuitive explanation , as noted in section [ ssec:4d ] , is that a single dominant interferer is the most likely contributor to causing outage , so a policy of pairwise channel inversion increases the likelihood of a dominant interference event occurring since the chances of at least one nearby transmitter having a poor channel to its receiver are reasonably good .",
    "third , note that the plots of spatial throughput and transmission capacity achieve the same peaks ( for each of the four cases ) , and that @xmath0 the peak capacity under threshold transmissions is over twice the peak capacity under randomized transmissions , and @xmath1 the outage requirement @xmath75 required to obtain those peaks is much smaller for threshold transmissions than for randomized transmissions . in effect , channel variability should not be dealt with through randomization , but instead should be exploited through threshold scheduling .",
    "for example 2 the @xmath39 are constant and the @xmath106 are exponentially distributed with parameter @xmath19 . solving @xmath314 in ( [ eqn : cd ] ) yields @xmath322 .",

    "the other three plots are for the same scenarios as in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",

    "figure [ fig:3 ] shows four plots of simulation and numerical results for nearest receiver transmissions .",
    "the top left plot illustrates the transmission capacity @xmath319 versus the outage requirement @xmath75 for randomized transmissions ( solid curves ) and threshold transmissions ( dashed curves ) with channel inversion .",
    "the three curves for each case are the lower and upper bounds along with simulation results .",
    "the bounds are again seen to be reasonably tight , especially for the small @xmath75 case of usual interest .",
    "the other three plots follow as in examples 1 and 2 .",
    "the comments from examples 1 and 2 apply here as well ; in other words random hop distances behave much like random channel effects . note that the bottom right plot of transmission capacity illustrates that threshold scheduling achieves a three fold or greater increase in transmission capacity relative to the capacity under randomized transmissions for all @xmath325 .",
    "even more than examples 1 and 2 , this example highlights the tension between throughput and fairness : in this example performance is maximized by employing a threshold rule such that only nodes that are sufficiently close to their intended receivers are selected to transmit . in example 2 and to a lesser extent example 1",
    ", one could argue that the channel coherence timescale is short enough such that the unfairness of opportunistic scheduling is of limited concern to the typical user . here , however , the transmitter receiver distances are changing on the timescale of user mobility , meaning the unfairness of opportunistic scheduling is of much greater concern .",
    "the goal of this paper was to develop a methodology , and some insights , on how ad hoc network capacity is affected by temporal variations in channel quality and transmission distance .",
    "we focused on the case where each node has only local information ; in particular it knows the channel to a desired receiver .",
    "this approach , while suboptimal , has the considerable merits of being realistic and analytically tractable .",
    "we made the following observations , with transmission capacity and outage probability as the metrics of interest .",
    "first , randomized transmissions perform poorly in the presence of either fading or variable channel distances .",
    "that is , variability strictly reduces capacity in transmitters that are blind to the channel .",
    "second , we showed that a policy of channel inversion , while helping users with poor channels , negatively impacts the overall network capacity .",
    "the intuition is that this increases the likelihood of a dominant interferer causing an outage : because of the coupled nature of all the links in an ad hoc network , channel inversion causes all the nodes in an area to suffer when a single link is poor .",
    "third , channel variations can be exploited through the use of simple threshold scheduling , where a user transmits when its desired channel is above a target .",
    "we derive the optimal threshold , and show that over many ranges of interest , the capacity is about three times higher than with no scheduling .",
