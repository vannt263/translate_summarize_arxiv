    "indeed , symanzik has shown @xcite that @xmath282 , calculated within the framework of dimensional regularization ( @xmath283 ) , takes on the following form : @xmath284 in which @xmath11 is the dimensioned _ unrenormalized _ @xmath212-coupling and the function @xmath285 displays poles at @xmath286 ( @xmath287 ) . by considering how the minimal subtraction scheme of the ( dimensionally regularized ) @xmath268 theory works within the @xmath276 expansion , rim and weisberger @xcite discovered that the subtraction functions of perturbation theory ( defined by the requirement of subtracting the _ simple _ poles located at @xmath288 and which introduces the renormalized parameter @xmath27 associated to the scale @xmath19 ) were not sufficient to obtain a well defined theory in the limit @xmath279 .",

    "indeed , rim and weisberger s result may be seen as symanzik s result continued to @xmath279 at which dimension , the `` infinite - cutoff limit '' of perturbation theory can not be effectuated without `` renormalizing the coupling constant '' , the difference between eq.([rim ] ) and eq.([4.4 ] ) originates in the renormalization of the coupling constant . ] .    in order to show the close relation of these `` additionnal '' terms with the `` invariant scale '' @xmath271 , we have applied the rules of dimensional renormalization on the critical parameter @xmath294 calculated at order @xmath276 .",

    "but the difference is that @xmath310 is absolutely needed ( generated by the theory itself @xcite ) while @xmath271 is a purely formal quantity attached to the artificial simple function @xmath311 .",
    "we have seen in part [ weghou ] that the functional form of the momentum scale dependence on @xmath153 is degenerated ( section [ sdcl ] ) and that it is the specification of the initial value @xmath149 which allows us to specify a unique renormalization flow running `` on '' @xmath153 .",
    "similarly , the parameter @xmath35 allows us to specify which determination of the functional form of the momentum - scale dependence is actually referred to on @xmath153 ( or on @xmath219 ) .    with the massive theory ,",
    "the singularities [ ir ] disappear but the singularities [ renorm ] remain .",

    "the renormalon singularities may be `` removed '' by considering all `` composite operators '' of dimension 8 , 10 , etc@xmath312 @xcite or , what is equivalent , by reintroducing an ultra - violet cutoff @xcite .",
    "it has been shown , for instance , that the perturbative series in powers of @xmath213 of the ( unrenormalized ) vertex functions of the @xmath268-``infra - red '' model''-theory with a finite ultra - violet cutoff @xmath172 similar to that considered in part [ weghou ] .",
    "] are borel summable @xcite .    indeed",
    ", the renormalons appear because the trajectory @xmath219 does not take its source at an ultra - violet stable fixed point .",
    "consequently , the associated domain of momentum scales covered by the running parameter @xmath27 is incomplete : when @xmath27 `` reaches '' infinity , the momentum scale of reference is still finite . here is the problem : we do not know how to associate a genuine momentum scale of reference to a value of @xmath27 because there are infinitely many parameters to be initialized .",
    "when @xmath27 is _ the _ relevant parameter at a fixed point then this association is easy to do : each degree of freedom delegates one s powers to @xmath27 .",
    "but , when there is no ultra - violet stable fixed point , one must actually specify the complete coordinates of an initial point lying on @xmath219 , what is actually impossible . the other possibility is to consider some wilson trajectory which will approach the trajectory @xmath219 in reducing the `` cutoff '' , this is the @xmath313-``infra - red '' model mentioned above .",
    "the inverse borel transforms of the perturbative series of the @xmath314-vertex functions are made ambiguous due to branch - point singularities located at real positive values of the borel variable @xmath315 ( the `` renormalon''-singularities ) .",
    "this does not imply that a borel resummation of the series can not be performed but rather that one does not know how to choose the integration contour in the complex @xmath315-plane so as to pick up such and such determination of the integrand at each singularity .",
    "thus an infinite number of conditions , unknown in the analytic treatment , must be ( re-)specified in order to fix one determination among an infinite number of allowed determinations ( the coordinates of the initial point on @xmath229 associated to the arbitrarily chosen momentum scale of reference must be specified ) .",
    "notice that , if the above considerations are correct , the emergence of renormalon singularities is strictly linked to the specification of an initial point lying on @xmath219 . if , on a pure mathematical ground ( without any consideration to a well defined field theory ) , we exclusively limit our interest to the renormalization flow _ running _ on @xmath229 via the simple function @xmath311 , then it would be possible to imagine a peculiar procedure to construct a @xmath0-function the perturbation series of which would be borel summable .    in our view",
    ", this peculiar procedure corresponds to the so - called _ minimal subtraction schemes_. in such a subtraction scheme , nothing else than the reference to a ( specific ) scale dependence defines the renormalized coupling constant @xmath27 , in particular , no reference to a vertex function ( involving the problem of controlling infinitely many degrees of freedom ) is introduced contrary to what is done when using a subtraction point procedure .          as for the singularities [ nic ] , they emerge for the same reason as the renormalon singularities appear in four dimensions : the lack of ultra - violet stable fixed point associated with the trajectory @xmath219 ( i.e. , in the range @xmath41 ) .    in view of testing some basical assumptions of the field theoretic approach to critical phenomena , a lattice - analog of the renormalized @xmath179 coupling constant has been defined as follows @xcite : @xmath317 \\chi ^{-2 }   \\label{glatt}\\ ] ] in which @xmath18 and @xmath318 are respectively , the correlation length and the susceptibility of the @xmath179-lattice - model ; @xmath319 is the magnetic field .",
    "@xmath320 `` looks like '' the renormalized @xmath179 coupling constant @xmath27 of the massive scheme in which the renormalized mass @xmath321 is essentially replaced by @xmath322 .    by analogy with field theory ,",
    "the lattice analog of the @xmath0-function is defined as follows @xcite : @xmath323 ^{-1 }   \\label{betalatt}\\ ] ] in which @xmath324 with @xmath11 the dimensioned unrenormalized @xmath179 coupling constant and @xmath33 .",
    "nickel s discovery of confluent singularities in the @xmath0-function follows from the remark that renormalization theory predicts @xcite several kinds of confluent critical singularities . the approach of @xmath325 to @xmath31 as @xmath326 is , thus , controlled by the following equation : @xmath327   \\label{tau}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which the exponents @xmath209 have already been encountered in sections [ fce ] and [ iasld ] .",
    "supplementary terms proportional to @xmath328 account for analytic confluent corrections in temperature usually not explicitly considered by renormalization theory and thus not relevant to the present discussion .    now , on reverting eq.([tau ] ) , and neglecting the above - mentioned analytic confluent corrections in temperature , one obtains : @xmath329   \\label{xilatt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and finally , using eq.([betalatt ] ) : @xmath330 in which @xmath331 .    obviously , the second line of eq .",
    "( [ betalatt2 ] ) displays a leading confluent - branch - point - singularity that is not accounted for in the resummation procedure of @xmath24 as used in @xcite .",
    "nickel then makes reference to the work of golner and riedel @xcite who found @xmath332 ( see also the more recent work of newman and riedel @xcite that yields in addition @xmath333 ) to argue that the confluent singularities could be practically very weak as explicitly assumed later on by zinn - justin @xcite .",
    "if so , nickel does not understand          the confluent singularities found by nickel in @xmath336 are due to what we have called the `` finite - cutoff effects '' ( see section [ slowly ] ) .",
    "these effects `` measure '' the significant deviations , in the critical surface @xmath140 , between a simple wilson trajectory ( of a lattice or `` cutoff '' theory ) and the ideal `` trajectory '' @xmath153 ( or @xmath219 ) of part [ weghou ] .",
    "consequently , in the field theoretic framework , nickel s confluent singularities within the @xmath0-function are either absent ( @xmath231 , by definition of the `` continuum limit '' ) or are extremely weak ( @xmath41 ) due to the ` large river ' effect where mass effects vanish . ] .",
    "the weakness of the confluent singularities could explain why , in their careful studies of the various available series , le  guillou and zinn - justin @xcite have not observed any numerical effect which could be clearly associated to the existence of such singularities .    despite the supposed weakness of the confluent singularities in the range @xmath337 for the massive framework in three dimensions ,",
    "attempts at systematically accounting for them have been made @xcite ( on the basis of the knowledge of seven orders instead of six orders only , except for the function @xmath338 for which only the already known six orders were used ) .",
    "their study has provided new exponent estimates which _ `` are in better agreement with other model calculations''_. this result could be seen as a concrete confirmation of the presence of confluent singularities in the range @xmath339 .",
    "but , due to the lack of relevant information on the actual value of @xmath340 and on higher order terms in the series of @xmath24 , it has only been concluded that the previous error bars @xcite could be _",
    "`` unrealistically small''_. it is also fair to indicate that , due to the lack of order in the series of @xmath24 a bias could have been introduced in the determination of the fixed point value @xmath31 .",
