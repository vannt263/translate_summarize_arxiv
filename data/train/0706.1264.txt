    "the idea that cosmic strings might have formed in the early universe has been around for some time , being a generic consequence of @xmath1 symmetry breaking .",
    "if observed , these long filaments of energy stretched across the sky would be the highest energy objects ever seen .",
    "even more spectacular is the idea that these cosmic strings might be cosmic superstrings .",
    "this idea was first proposed by witten @xcite , but for several technical reasons this was found to be unfeasible .",
    "progress in superstring theory , particularly non - perturbative aspects , allowed the subject to be revisited recently @xcite @xcite with encouraging results . for more complete reviews of the subject see @xcite @xcite .",
    "since it is now at least plausible that cosmic strings might be observed , it is important to know how one might differentiate conventional cosmic strings from cosmic superstrings .",
    "the former are classical objects , being an effective description of a field theory vortex solution .",
    "superstrings , however cosmically extended they may be , are inherently quantum objects .",
    "ideally these quantum fluctuations would provide observable differences in the cosmic string s behavior , allowing us to determine which type of string it is .",
    "the issue is doubly important since experimental evidence of string theory from colliders is not expected to be forthcoming in the near future , and this may be the best opportunity to prove string theory is the correct theory of nature .",
    "wound states appear in the perturbative spectrum of the bosonic , type ii and heterotic string theories but there has been relatively little investigation into their interactions .",
    "the first was by polchinski and dai @xcite @xcite who used the optical theorem to compute the reconnection probability for bosonic wound strings .",
    "such scattering was also studied by khuri @xcite finding that interaction is suppressed in the large - winding limit , whereas mende used path integral saddle points @xcite to show that for some special configurations it may still occur .",
    "reconnection probabilities of wound superstrings were studied in @xcite , and further investigation into the effect of backgrounds was performed in @xcite .    in this article",
    "we develop new methods for calculating cosmic superstring interactions .",
    "we first review the reconnection process , and show explicitly that the probability of reconnection can be obtained by summing over all final kinked states .",
    "this method naturally generalizes to the possibility of emitting radiation during reconnection , and allows us to calculate the probability for this as well .",
    "we discuss the spacetime trajectory of the strings during reconnection , as well as loop corrections to the interactions . a novel boundary functional representation of the kinked string is also given .",
    "finally we conclude with an overview of upcoming experiments which might be sensitive to these signatures . to emphasize the principles introduced here we study only the bosonic string , but",
    "the ideas should easily generalize to the superstring .",
    "we will model cosmic superstrings as wound fundamental string states .",
    "these will then interact to form other wound states , but will typically be kinked due to the relative angle between the initial states ( see figure 1 ) . the most straightforward way to study these interactions is to construct vertex operators for all states .",
    "consider two long , straight wound strings on a 2d torus of size @xmath2 and skew angle @xmath3 as illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "the momenta are taken to be         +    @xmath4^{1/2 } ( 1,0,0,0 , { \\bf 0 } ) , \\hspace{0.5 in } l_1 = l ( 0,1,0,0 , { \\bf 0}),\\ ] ] @xmath5^{1/2 } [ 1-v^2]^{-1/2 } ( 1,0,0,v , { \\bf 0 } ) , \\hspace{0.5 in } l_2 = l ( 0,\\cos \\theta,\\sin \\theta,0 , { \\bf 0 } ) .\\ ] ] these satisfy the conditions such there are no complications involving the branch cuts of the vertex operators ( see section 8.2 of @xcite ) , and also the tachyonic mass - shell conditions @xmath6 the relevant vertex operators are : ( @xmath7 ) @xmath8 where the volume @xmath9 is the product of the the transverse volume and the 2d torus ( methods to calculate @xmath10 can be found in @xcite ) . now examining the ope of these vertex operators ( we will only consider the holomorphic side , the antiholomorphic side is identical ) : @xmath11 the taylor expansion of the exponential shows the vertex operators of the infinite tower of the produced states , which will appear kinked due to their large oscillator excitation number @xmath12 : @xmath13 since @xmath14 the result will be identical for the right - moving oscillators and so @xmath15 . the vertex operators for the possible final states ( labeled by index @xmath16 )",
    "@xmath17 will be the @xmath18 coefficient in the expansion of the exponential , each weighted by a coefficient @xmath19 . to extract these we simply take the contour integral in independent variables @xmath20 and @xmath21 around the origin : @xmath22 with @xmath23 the normalization for sphere amplitudes .",
    "we have normalized the rhs of ( [ kinkvertex ] ) so that these coefficients @xmath19 are none other than the invariant amplitude to produce that final kinked state , @xmath24 the number of possible final states is then that of a string excited along a single dimension @xmath25 , @xmath26 owing to this large degeneracy as @xmath27 in the cosmic string limit , it will be impossible to explicitly write down this sum of kinked vertex operators , but there is a simple statistical distribution .",
    "consider the state corresponding to the sum of these vertex operators ( [ kinkvertex ] ) : @xmath28 the expectation value of the number operator @xmath29 in this state is : @xmath30 to evaluate the contours we have transformed the outgoing state contour variable @xmath31 so that it is also taken around the origin , and then used the standard representation @xmath32 although this is the spectrum expected for a kinked string , the distribution does not converge to this mean state when the excitation number grows large , as can be seen by the relative fluctuation : @xmath33 it would be interesting to see whether there is any relation of this state to the kinky strings studied by mcloughlin _",
    "we can now use the expression ( [ kinkvertex ] ) to calculate the reconnection probability that two straight strings would scatter into any final kink state , which is the interaction cross - section as shown in figure 3 : @xmath34        to evaluate this we will use the orthonormal relation for two - point correlators on the sphere ( we assume that both @xmath35 and @xmath36 are on - shell vertex operators ) : @xmath37 we also wish to transform the integral over phase space into a more useful form . recall that this is the space of all on - shell final states , @xmath38 this delta function represents the change in phase space with respect to the 2-momentum invariant @xmath39 , which gives poles at @xmath40 . in the large - mass limit of our cosmic strings",
    "we can perform an averaging over these poles , @xmath41 this is same averaging of poles into a branch cut performed in @xcite @xcite in order to utilize the optical theorem .",
    "the probability can now be easily calculated : @xmath42 ^ 2 \\\\ \\label{ampsum }   & & \\hspace{0.5 in } = \\frac{8 \\pi \\kappa^2}{{\\alpha ' } v } ( n+1)^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] substituting back for @xmath43 , taking the @xmath44 limit , and writing the answer in terms of the dimensionless coupling @xmath45 , the probability of reconnection is simply @xmath46      let us now rederive the results in the previous section , using an abbreviated notation which will be very useful for more complicated interactions .",
    "just as we used the contour integral to extract the on - shell part of the @xmath47 ope , the @xmath48 state will be the part of @xmath49 that it is annihilated by both @xmath50 and @xmath51 : @xmath52 a projection operator which accomplishes this can easily be constructed to be @xmath53 so that @xmath54 identifying @xmath55 then yields the previous expression ( [ kinkstate ] )",
    ". the sum over final states can now be written as simply @xmath56 we can use merely a single @xmath57 since like other projection operators @xmath58 .",
    "it is then straightforward to see that this yields ( [ ampsum ] ) .",
    "this formalism also allows us to make contact with the use of the optical theorem @xcite @xcite , written @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the closed string propagator with feynman @xmath61 prescription , @xmath62 let us now trade the ( anti)holomorphic operators @xmath63 for the worldsheet hamiltonian @xmath64 and momentum @xmath65 operators : @xmath66 the propagator can then be written as @xmath67 this is then identical to the expression given above .      the probability for intercommutation should also include the possibility that radiation could be emitted in the process of reconnection .",
    "such emission has been studied previously using other techniques @xcite @xcite but here we show it is a simple generalization of the same process used to compute ordinary reconnection probabilities .",
    "the amplitude that a single state @xmath68 will be emitted during the reconnection to kink @xmath16 is given by @xmath69        this amplitude represents four different field theory processes : the @xmath70- , @xmath71- , and @xmath72-channel interactions as well as a contact term as shown in figure 4 . actually , only the first and last of these contribute .",
    "consider the excitation number of the intermediate states : for the @xmath70-channel this is the same excitation number as for the kink computed previously , @xmath73 whereas for @xmath71- and @xmath72- this is @xmath74 since we can not have a negatively excited string , there are no intermediate states in these channels .",
    "nonetheless , we consider the expression representing all four channels by writing the expression for the sum over ( perturbed ) kink states in terms of the two distinct vertex operator orderings , where we integrate in @xmath75 to include the pole over the intermediate states ( rather than contour integrate to simply get the residue ) : @xmath76 with the new possibility that the radiation could be directed into the @xmath77-@xmath78 plane , there is the slight complication that we have compactified along these directions so the momentum must be discrete rather than continuous . as appropriate in the large-@xmath2 limit , we approximate the sum over kk modes as an integral over continuous momenta times the compactification volume , @xmath79 we also add a 2d sum over @xmath80 and momentum - conservation integral , for which the volume factors cancel , @xmath81 making these modifications to the reconnection probability given in ( [ p0 ] ) , we arrive at @xmath82 this is evaluated using the same techniques as in the simple reconnection case , averaging the poles of @xmath80 ( but _ not _ k ) , and multiplying by an additional @xmath83 for the units introduced by the propagators , @xmath84 using the integral representation of the propagator , @xmath85 we can act on the radiation vertex operators in every permutation , since @xmath86 will always be adjacent to either @xmath87 or @xmath57 . for example , @xmath88 adding all permutations together ( corresponding to different regions of integration for the radiation ) , this results in integration over the entire complex plane . we then interpret the reconnection process as a background for the radiation , meaning we neglect the cross - radiation term , and the correlation between radiation vertex operators disappears . ] as well as the effect that the radiation would have on the projection onto physical states .",

    "we see there is an additional branch cut produced on this axis for @xmath96 , @xmath97 as one crosses this at large @xmath98 , the two branch cuts conspire to replace the gradual winding on @xmath99 with a step - function .",

    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this partly illuminates a puzzle discovered in @xcite , that there is a @xmath102 divergence in the fundamental string reconnection probability .",
    "since the integrand in ( [ prad2 ] ) universally contains the exponential of @xmath103 , the integration over @xmath104 will result in an additional factor of @xmath102 ( recall the original @xmath102 originated from the incoming strings kinematic factor ) . again taking the cross - radiation effects to be negligible",
    ", the result immediately generalizes to multiple radiative emissions : @xmath105 \\right|^2 .\\ ] ] the probability that there are @xmath106 states radiated during reconnection will have @xmath106 such radiated momenta integrals and produce a factor of @xmath107 .",
    "the tree - level reconnection probability can then be put in the form @xmath108 this implies that the effective coupling seen by the strings is actually @xmath109 so that the perturbative , small velocity limit should be defined by @xmath110 and fixed @xmath111 . loop corrections to this simply add factors of @xmath112 which vanish , so in some sense the strings become classical in this limit .",
    "the resultant integral of the radiation vertex operator over @xmath98 is then easily evaluated since as explained in @xcite the radiation amplitude drops exponentially with energy unless there exist double saddle points @xmath113 ( such as for a cusp ) in which case it is a slower power - law decay or when the ( say ) holomorphic side has a saddle point and the antiholomorphic derivative is discontinuous ( such as for a kink ) , which is what happens in ( [ largenxcl ] ) .",

    "but it can give us some idea of how string theory sees the reconnection process , both from the worldsheet and spacetime viewpoints .    in figure 5 the string worldsheet",
    "is shown with the coloring added to illustrate how these asymptotic string states smoothly reconnect : red , green and blue indicate the  pure \" states at @xmath115 , respectively .",
    "good local coordinates near the straight - string vertex operators at @xmath116 are @xmath117 , and for the kinked state placed at infinity we use @xmath118 . in these coordinates @xmath119 generates @xmath120 .",
    "in the spacetime embedding of _ only the straight string vertex operators _ @xmath92 and @xmath93 shown in figure 6 , we see the initial straight wound strings arrive from @xmath121 , then smoothly join into a single kinked string as @xmath122 . although the strings appear to break , this is merely the effect of the worldsheet embedding into spacetime and then slicing it with respect to @xmath71 .",
    "we have seen that the probability of reconnection should include not just the probability of simple reconnection but processes which produce radiation .",
    "in fact one should also include higher - order corrections for each of these ( omitting phase - space factors ) , @xmath123   .\\ ] ] the most convenient way to compute the loop effects would be to compute the correction to the total cross - section : @xmath124 in @xcite it was noted that this diverged at higher loops since @xmath125 , but the cause was suspected to be the incorrect inclusion of amplitudes having multiple final kinked string states , each state having normalization @xmath126",
    ". the correct approach would be evaluating ( [ naivecor ] ) while excising the intermediate states containing multiple kinked strings ( since these would not correspond to a reconnection ! ) .",
    "this could be done by keeping only the part of each @xmath127 proportional to @xmath128 , corresponding to final states containing only a single kinked string .",
    "investigation along these lines is underway @xcite .",
    "now let us consider radiation not from reconnection , but simply emitted from a string state as it evolves .",
    "there is now vast literature on gravitational radiation from classical cosmic strings ( see for example @xcite @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "this is computed by fourier transforming the functional derivative of the string action , @xmath129 note that this can be interpreted as a graviton vertex operator integrated over the worldsheet . as explained previously ,",
    "this is largest when both @xmath130 and @xmath131 develop saddle points ( such as in a cusp ) , or when one does and the other develops a discontinuity ( such as in a kink ) . by substituting in a suitable solution for @xmath132 around this point",
    "one can calculate the radiation emitted .",
    "we would now hope to calculate the same quantity for cosmic superstrings from first principles ; that is , use vertex operators to represent the radiation ( not necessarily gravitational ) as well as for the cosmic string states themselves . for the radiation emitted from a cosmic string of vertex operator @xmath133",
    ", the amplitude is @xmath134 however , it would be much easier to compare to the classical answer if we could use an effective string action , at least for the massless radiation : @xmath135\\ ] ] where this is defined as performing the path integral over quantum fluctuations in a classical background , @xmath136 } = \\int \\left . [ dx ' ] \\right|_{x = x_{\\rm cl}+x ' } [ dh ] e^{-s[x , h ] } .\\ ] ] evaluating this path integral is actually trivial because we know there should be no corrections to the classical action , string theory being _ defined _ by the condition that the worldsheet beta functionals are all zero ! thus the classical source ( [ gravsource ] ) is correct even for quantum superstrings ( modulo the addition of fermions ) .",
    "there will still be differences in the actual signal measured by a gravitational wave detector since the graviton must propagate according to the @xmath137-corrected general relativity of string theory , but the source term will be the same .",
    "recently the small - scale structure which underlies this radiation emission has recently been studied in @xcite @xcite @xcite .    in order to ensure the beta functions are indeed zero it is necessary to represent the cosmic superstring as a physical string state (",
    "that is , satisfies the virasoro constraints ) .",
    "this is a different approach taken from @xcite who model the cosmic superstring as a semi - classical coherent state .",
    "this then produces very small corrections in the source term , though still too small to be observed .    for massive radiated states",
    "it is completely straightforward to compute the emission decay rate using the same technique as that used for the reconnection probability , where the sum over amplitudes and final states can be computed from the distribution @xmath138 of course the total decay rate must equal that given by the imaginary part of the one - loop mass correction , @xmath139 this is the approach used to calculate the decay rate for highly excited cosmic string ` loops ' which have broken off of large winding modes @xcite @xcite .",
    "the methods we have developed here work exclusively for fundamental cosmic superstrings",
    ". it would be theoretically and practically convenient to generalize this to d - strings @xcite and @xmath0-strings @xcite .",
    "the interactions of these have been studied using either a string worldsheet with boundary conditions or as field theories living on the d - string worldvolume @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "one might try to formulate such a general approach for string interactions by defining boundary functionals to represent the fundamental strings ; that is , states defined on the unit circle which are a function of the coordinate modes @xmath140 . for the straight strings ( formerly represented as wound tachyon vertex operators ) these states @xmath141 are simply gaussian distributions reflecting the fact that they are unexcited ground states , @xmath142 for the kinked fundamental string states defined in ( [ kinkstate ] ) the answer is more interesting .",
    "we attempt to construct such a state @xmath143 by factoring the kink state as @xmath144 where @xmath60 is the closed string propagator . to accomplish this ,",
    "let us reexamine the earlier process used to construct the kink states in terms of a projection operator of @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "re - writing ( [ holokink ] ) in terms of these operators , we get an expression which can be factorized into the desired form of ( [ factored ] ) : @xmath145 thus we identify our boundary functional as @xmath146 such a @xmath147 factor should be familiar from amplitudes which factor closed string amplitudes into ( anti)holomorphic components . to write this in a more useful form , represent the operator as the difference of exponentials @xmath148 this can now easily act on @xmath149 to produce @xmath150 where we have defined the coherent states @xmath151 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] though there are an infinite number of oscillator excitations the propagator @xmath60 will project only onto the on - shell portion of this .",
    "thus the state can be thought of heuristically as @xmath152 at the origin and @xmath153 placed at @xmath154 , though it is not a usual vertex operator @xmath155 in the sense that @xmath156 is not the complex conjugate of @xmath98 .",
    "even though we have defined these states @xmath141 and @xmath157 on the unit circle in an attempt to make them similar to d - branes , they are not boundary states in that they do not define boundary conditions : there is  charge \" ( in the form of the vertex operator @xmath153 ) located on the boundary so it is impossible to fix boundary conditions there",
    ". it would be interesting to see whether this novel representation of the kink can be used for more efficient computation of the interactions .",
    "it is now possible to calculate the interaction and radiation for cosmic superstrings as well as their classical counterparts .",
    "this is particularly exciting due to the increasing sensitivity of experiments to cosmic string radiation , stochastic as well as directed bursts .",
    "bounds on these currently exist from various sources such as ligo s4 , pulsar timing , big bang nucleosynthesis , and the cosmic microwave background , with potential further bounds from advanced ligo and lisa @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "these bounds are very dependent upon parameters such as the dimensionless string tension parameter @xmath158 , probability of reconnection @xmath65 , loop size parameter @xmath20 and radiative parameter @xmath159 @xcite . with the tools developed in this article",
    "one can begin to study the phenomenology of models based on superstring parameters @xmath160 and @xmath45 , plus specifics of compactification @xcite .",
    "if even a single cosmic string is found , one can get an observational estimate of @xmath161 from examining the kinks on the string as it has reconnected during its lifetime .",
    "a low @xmath162 suggests a fundamental cosmic superstring such as those studied here , whereas a higher @xmath163 suggests a classical vortex cosmic string or @xmath0-string .",
    "the angle- and velocity - dependent reconnection probability can easily be incorporated into a simulation or analytic study @xcite to study the abundance of cosmic strings present today .",
    "it might also be relevant to string - gas studies since winding string interaction rates could influence the decompactification rate of the universe @xcite .",
