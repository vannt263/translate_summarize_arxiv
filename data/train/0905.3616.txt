    "lattice qcd provides a non - perturbative tool to explore many properties of hadrons from first principles . in the case of the hadron mass spectrum",
    "there are well developed methods to compute the mass spectra . however , while the extraction of the ground states of the hadron spectrum is a well understood problem , and has provided impressive agreement with experimental results  @xcite , the excited states still prove a significant challenge .",
    "the euclidean - time correlation function provides access to a tower of states since it is a sum of decaying exponentials with the masses of the states in the exponents .",
    "the ground state mass , being the lowest energy state and thereby having the slowest decay rate , is obtained by analysis of the large time behaviour of this function .",
    "the excited states , however , belong to the sub - leading exponentials of the two - point correlation function .",
    "extracting excited states masses from these sub - leading exponents is difficult as the correlation functions decay quickly and the signal to noise ratio deteriorates more rapidly .",
    "one of the long - standing puzzles in hadron spectroscopy has been the low mass of the first positive parity , @xmath2 , excitation of the nucleon , known as the roper resonance @xmath3(1440 mev ) . in constituent or valence quark models with harmonic oscillator potentials ,",
    "the lowest - lying odd parity states naturally occurs below the @xmath4 state ( with principal quantum number @xmath5 )  @xcite whereas , in nature the roper resonance is almost 100 mev below the @xmath6(1535 mev ) state .",
    "similar difficulties in the level orderings appear for the @xmath7 and @xmath8 resonances , which have led to the speculation that the roper resonance may be more appropriately viewed as a hybrid baryon state with explicitly excited glue field configurations  @xcite or as a breathing mode of the ground state  @xcite or states which can be described in terms of meson - baryon dynamics alone  @xcite .",
    "the first detailed analysis of the positive parity excitation of nucleon was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite using wilson fermions and an operator product expansion spectral ansatz .",
    "since then several attempts have been made to address these issues in the lattice framework  @xcite , but in many cases no potential identification of the roper state has been made  @xcite .",
    "recently however , in the analysis of  @xcite , a low - lying roper state has been observed by using advanced fitting techniques  @xcite based on bayesian priors .",

    "it is well known that the eigenstate energies have a volume dependence and will change as one changes the volume  @xcite . however , as we consider only one fixed volume , the eigenstate energies are fixed .",

    "all our @xmath1 correlation matrix analyses provide two nearly degenerate excited - state masses . however , our concern is that these two masses correspond to strongly mixed qcd eigenstates that our analysis using the standard correlation matrix of @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 interpolators is unable to resolve .",
