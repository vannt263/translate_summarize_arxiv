    "in physics , the principle of relativity establishes the equivalence between all inertial observers but at the same time raises them to a special class in the sense that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of references .",
    "the transition from classical mechanics to special relativity maintains this assumption intact and only modify the group of symmetry associated with these inertial observers . in classical mechanics we have the galilean invariance of newtonian physics while in special relativity we have the poincar group connecting different inertial observers . to each of these groups of symmetry",
    "there is a geometrical absolute object and an invariant physical quantity associated to it . in particular , in classical mechanics the tridimensional euclidean metric is an absolute object and the length of material bodies is invariant under the action of the galilean group .",
    "accordingly , in special relativity the absolute and invariant objects are respectively the minkowski four - dimensional metric , which in cartesian coordinates reads @xmath0 , and the spacetime interval defined by @xmath1 .",
    "however , inertial frames of reference are only idealizations inasmuch real physical observers are always interacting and hence they are actually accelerated observers . in order to connect the laws of physics defined for inertial observers with actual measurements performed by accelerated observers there is an extra assumption that following bahram mashhoon @xcite-@xcite we shall call the hypothesis of locality .",
    "this hypothesis states that an accelerated observer is instantaneously equivalent to a momentarily comoving inertial observer .",
    "in other words , the path of an accelerated observer can be understood as a continuous sequence of inertial observers with appropriate instantaneously velocities .",
    "this hypothesis of locality is consistent with the newtonian world - view of point - like particles where the state of a physical system is completely determined by the position and velocity of its parts at a given time .",
    "notwithstanding , wave phenomena are intrinsic nonlocal and as mashhoon have shown @xcite-@xcite this hypothesis of locality is , in general , only approximately valid .",
    "the accuracy of the locality approximation depends on the relative variability between the observer s velocity and the typical timescale of the system under consideration .",
    "suppose that the physical process has a typical size @xmath2 or a typical timescale that can always be associated with a length through the velocity of light , _",
    "i.e.  _ @xmath3 and let the magnitude of the observer s acceleration be @xmath4 such that the timescale over which his / her velocity changes be given by @xmath5 , or in terms of length @xmath6 .",
    "the condition for the validity of the hypothesis of locality can be cast as @xmath7    this relation encodes the idea that during a measurement the velocity of the observer should not vary significantly such that he / she does not depart too much from an inertial frame of reference .",
    "as an example , consider a monochromatic electromagnetic wave with frequency @xmath8 .",
    "to properly measure the frequency of this wave , an observer needs to capture the oscillations of the electromagnetic fields .",
    "the number of oscillations can vary with the adequacy of the experimental apparatus but he / she will need at minimum two oscillations for such a measurement .",
    "thus , the experiment should last longer than the wave s period , _",
    "i.e.  _ @xmath9 . if an observer has instantaneous velocity @xmath10 , then the timescale over which it changes its velocity appreciably is @xmath11 .",
    "therefore the hypothesis of locality requires that @xmath12 .",
    "the two typical cases are for a linearly accelerated observer and for a rotating observer with fixed radius . for an observer describing a circle of radius r and angular velocity @xmath13 the centripetal acceleration is given by @xmath14 .",
    "thus , in terms of the wave - length @xmath15 , for a linear acceleration @xmath16 the conditions for the hypothesis of locality reads @xmath17 .",
    "similarly for a rotating observer we have @xmath18 .    generally , these quantities are too small to be detected in laboratory experiments since the earth gravitational field gives @xmath19 while its rotation gives @xmath20 that are much larger than typical dimensions of laboratory systems",
    ". thus one should expect the hypothesis of locality to be very suitable to everyday physics .",
    "notwithstanding , there are situations where it might break - down as for instance an electric charged particle interacting with an electromagnetic field .",
    "it is well known that charged particles irradiates when accelerated , hence , its equation of motion must include a term to account for its lost of energy . as a consequence",
    "the state of the accelerated particle is not completely specified by its position and velocity at a given instant of time , _",
    "i.e.  _ the hypothesis of locality is violated in this case .",
    "let us consider an arbitrary physical field @xmath21 written in terms of a global inertial coordinate system @xmath22 .",
    "in an another inertial frame of reference @xmath23 , associated with a moving observer , the same field becomes @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a lorentz matrix connecting both systems and @xmath26 is the proper time of the observer . in the case of an accelerated observer ,",
    "one shall use a set of vectors attached to him / her , namely his / her tetrad field , to project the @xmath21 field in his / her local frame of reference .",
    "therefore we have @xmath27 with the @xmath28 matrix builded from the tetrad field .",
    "let us designate by @xmath29 the actual measurement performed by the observer .",
    "then the hypothesis of locality identifies @xmath30 , _",
    "i.e.  _ the observer measures exactly the instantaneously projected field @xmath31 .    in order to account for nonlocal effects due to acceleration",
    ", one has to generalize this relation .",
    "following mashhoon s ansatz @xcite , we shall maintain a linear relation between the physical field @xmath31 and the measured field @xmath29 . the most general linear relation that satisfies causality is of the form @xmath32 with @xmath33 being the moment when acceleration starts and @xmath34 is the _ kernel _ associated with the observer s acceleration .",
    "in particular , without acceleration , the kernel must vanish so that we recover the relation @xmath30 .",
    "the _ ansatz _ eq.([428 ] ) is a volterra integral equation of the second kind which , for a given kernel , uniquely determine the field @xmath29 in terms of @xmath35 ( see ref.s @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "the choice of the kernel can be motivated by requiring that no electromagnetic radiation field can be at rest with respect to any observer , inertial or accelerated .",
    "in other words , if @xmath36 is a static field for a given observer than necessarily @xmath29 is also static .",
    "this condition implies that @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a constant .",
    "this relation still does nt determine uniquely the kernel so we must add the assumption that the kernel is a function of a single variable .",
    "there are two proposals in the literature for single variable kernels ( see ref.s @xcite-@xcite ) , namely , the kinetic kernel @xmath39 and the dynamic kernel @xmath40 .",
    "however , the dynamic kernel might endure even after the end of the acceleration hence producing , in some cases , divergencies of the fields .",
    "for this reason , we shall hereon focus only on the kinetic kernel .",
    "differentiating eq.([430 ] ) we find @xmath41 where the existence of the inverse matrix @xmath42 is guaranteed by the existence of the inverse of the tetrad field .",
    "note that as soon as the acceleration stops the @xmath43 matrix no longer varies and the kinetic kernel vanishes .",
    "this shows that the kinetic kernel is free of the endurance issue of the dynamic kernel . using the above result we have @xmath44 or integrating by parts @xmath45    one can immediately check from eq.([nonlocalfields1a ] ) that two generic observers will always agree if the physical field is constant or not .",
    "indeed , if an observer measures a constant @xmath31 field then the other observer will also measure @xmath46 .",
    "in this paper we are interested in examining the acceleration induced nonlocal effects in a black body radiation .",
    "as it is well know , the universe is filled with a homogenous and isotropic radiation thermal bath that presents the most perfect black body spectrum ever measured .",
    "thus , it is suitable to analyze nonlocal contribution to this radiation field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we apply the nonlocal theory for electromagnetic fields and construct the nonlocal energy - momentum tensor measured by an accelerated observer . in section  [ sec : hibbr ] we describe the black body radiation field and the average procedure to achieve a homogenous and isotropic radiation field .",
    "section  [ sec : theobg ] we analyze the nonlocal effects and conclude with some final remarks .",
    "the nonlocal formalism described in the last section is general in the sense that @xmath47 can be any physical field ( see ref.s @xcite-@xcite ) . in particular , for an electromagnetic field , the faraday tensor has two spacetime indices . given the tensor field @xmath48 , an accelerated observer will measure the projected tensor @xmath49 where @xmath50 is its associated tetrad field . in what follows , it will be convenient to define a six - dimensional vector @xmath51 such that @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a @xmath54 matrix .",
    "the six - dimensional vector @xmath55 plays the role of the @xmath47 field , hence , it is the electromagnetic field measured by an inertial observer .",
    "the hypothesis of locality claims that the accelerated observer will measure @xmath56 given by eq.([nonlocaleletromagfields ] ) .",
    "however , accordingly to eq.([nonlocalfields1 ] ) , the nonlocal electromagnetic fields @xmath57 are given by @xmath58    the nonlocal fields @xmath59 depend on the observer s world - line .",
    "thus , to go further on our analysis , we must specify a particular trajectory ( for a general discussion see @xcite ) .",
    "we shall develop our analysis for a linear accelerated observer .",
    "since we are neglecting any gravitational effects , in other words , the background is the minkowski flat spacetime , we can choose , without restriction , the observer trajectory along the @xmath60 direction .",
    "let us consider a linearly accelerated observer along a given direction , say the @xmath60 axis .",
    "if its comoving acceleration is a constant @xmath61 then the lorentz transformations give @xmath62 where @xmath4 is the observe s acceleration along the @xmath60 direction . integrating eq.([acrep ] ) we find the well known hyperbolic trajectory for a rindler observer ( see ref.s  @xcite-@xcite ) @xmath63    using the observer s proper time @xmath64 , we can parametrize the hyperbolic motion as @xmath65 where we have define @xmath66 for later convenience .",
    "the perpendicular directions remain intact , _ i.e.  _ @xmath67 and @xmath68 . the tetrad fields associated with this accelerated observer read @xmath69",
    "a direct calculation shows that the electric and magnetic fields @xmath70 are given by @xmath71 or explicitly in components , the local electromagnetic fields @xmath70 can be written in terms of the background fields as @xmath72 and @xmath73    the above equation allow us to identify the six by six @xmath74 matrix appearing in eq.([nonlocaleletromagfields ] ) as @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are two three by three matrix given by @xmath78    the nonlocal fields are obtained by using @xmath74 in eq.([nonlocaleletromagfields2 ] ) , _",
    "i.e.  _ @xmath79 and @xmath80    the thermal properties of the electromagnetic radiation fields are encoded in the decomposition of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "this decomposition depends explicitly on the observer s world - line and hence will also carry nonlocal effects . for an arbitrary observer ,",
    "the local energy - momentum tensor is simply the projection of the standard energy - momentum tensor in its tetrad field , _",
    "@xmath81    projecting the electromagnetic energy - momentum tensor along and perpendicular to the observer s world - line , we can define the thermodynamics quantities such as the energy density , isotropic pressure , poynting vector and maxwell s stress tensor .",
    "let the observer s world - line be given by the velocity field @xmath82 .",
    "the energy density @xmath83 is defined as the double projection of @xmath84 along the observer s world - line , while the isotropic pressure @xmath85 is one - third of the energy density minus its trace . the poynting vector @xmath86 is given by projecting one indices of the @xmath84 along the observer s trajectory and the other in its local space by using the projector @xmath87 .",
    "finally , the maxwell s stress tensor @xmath88 is defined as the double projection in the observer s local space .",
    "thus , we have @xmath89\\ .\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the transformation in the electromagnetic fields , eq.([eacel])-([bacel ] ) , induces a transformation in the energy - momentum tensor such that @xmath90with the two by two matrix given by @xmath91    therefore , the description of an electromagnetic radiation in terms of the thermodynamics quantities eq.([decomptmunu ] ) depends on the state of motion of the observer",
    ". we shall be interested in how nonlocal effects change these properties .",
    "in particular we shall analyze the case for a homogeneous and isotropic black body radiation .",
    "as it is well known , a black body radiation is a thermal radiation whose spectrum has an universal feature , _",
    "i.e.  _ its spectral distribution satisfies planck s law and is completely characterized by its temperature .",
    "let @xmath92 be the energy density contained in the range of frequencies @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the black body planck distribution is given by @xmath95 with @xmath96 , @xmath97 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath98 the temperature .",
    "integrating over all frequencies we obtain the stefan - boltzmann law @xmath99 where @xmath100 .    given a generic bath of radiation , the energy density depends on both the position and on the time , _ i.e.  _ @xmath101 .",
    "however , a homogenous and isotropic radiation must be such that the average of the electric and magnetic fields vanish . in this case",
    ", the average energy density has no spatial dependence and becomes only a function of time .",
    "consider an ensemble of identical systems and let us define the ensemble averaged value of a quantity @xmath102 by @xmath103    it is evident that if @xmath102 is an incoherent quantity then its average will not depend on the position , _",
    "i.e.  _ @xmath104 .",
    "an incoherent electromagnetic field ( ref .",
    "s  @xcite-@xcite ) must have @xmath105 . on the other hand ,",
    "its average energy density depends on the square of the fields @xmath106 for an incoherent field we expect to have @xmath107    a third condition for homogeneity and isotropy is that the electromagnetic fields have no energy flux , hence the fields must satisfy @xmath108 in such a way that it has zero poynting vector .",
    "these conditions can be put in a more compact expression as @xmath109    even though in general the average quantities can depend on time , we will assume hereon that the average thermodynamics quantities are constant .    in order to describe the correlation of the same components of the fields but in two different positions and/or times we shall assume that the fields are stationary in space and time such that its correlation depends only on the differences @xmath110 and @xmath111 . in this way we can define a coherent function as @xmath112    in vacuum , the electromagnetic fields satisfy the wave equation which implies that the above function must also satisfy an identical wave equation @xmath113    then , it follows that @xmath114 can be written as a linear combination of periodic functions @xmath115 with @xmath116 .",
    "there is a close analogy between the present situation and the hydrodynamic flow of a homogeneous fluid ( see ref.@xcite ) . in particular , the vanishing of the divergence of the electric field , @xmath117 , is analogous to the vanishing of the divergence of the velocity field for an incompressible fluid @xmath118 . in this case",
    "we have @xmath119 where in principle @xmath120 and @xmath121 are arbitrary real functions .",
    "notwithstanding , the continuity condition @xmath122 implies that @xmath123 .",
    "therefore , the function @xmath124 depends only on one generic function and can be written as @xmath125    using this result back in eq.([57 ] ) , the coherence function for the same spatial point @xmath126 becomes @xmath127 to simplify the above integral we recall that @xmath128 which give us @xmath129    for a black body radiation @xmath130 and hence @xmath131    defining the quantity @xmath132 , direct integration gives @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the langevin function defined as @xmath135    langevin function and its first three derivatives.,width=321 ]    the general behavior of the @xmath134 function and its three first derivatives is plotted in figure [ graficos_l ] .",
    "note that these functions are smooth and restricted to the interval @xmath136 $ ] .",
    "in particular , @xmath137 while its derivatives go to zero for the same limit .",
    "thus , the correlation given by eq.([fcor ] ) decays as time differences increases .",
    "another property worth mentioning is that the langevin function has a symmetry given by @xmath138",
    "in the previous sections , we have developed the mathematical machinery to describe the nonlocal effects in a thermal bath .",
    "however , the thermodynamics properties of radiation fields depend on the observer s state of motion even assuming the hypothesis of locality .",
    "an observer moving through an homogenous and isotropic thermal bath will , in general , detect a non - zero poynting vector even though an inertial observer at rest with respect to the same radiation field will measure zero poynting vector . in order to extract the nonlocal effects we have first to disentangle it from the common local relativistic effects .",
    "the nonlocal effects are taken into account by the map @xmath139 in the energy - momentum tensor eq.([e - m ] ) @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the nonlocal faraday tensor .",
    "the average value of each of its components can be calculated by using the properties of homogeneity and isotropy introduced in section  [ sec : hibbr ] .",
    "the average energy density measured by an accelerated observer is given by @xmath142 a typical term of this expression is @xmath143 where the subscripts stand for the nature of each term .",
    "the first term with subscript `` @xmath144 '' is simply the common local term , `` @xmath145 '' is the first nonlocal corretion that is linear in the observer s acceleration and the last one is quadratic .",
    "the relativistic local part is given by @xmath146    the `` @xmath145 '' has integral terms of @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "these quantities can be associated to the correlation function eq.([fcor ] ) for different proper times such that @xmath149 with @xmath150    we can then write @xmath151    simirlarly , the quadratic term reads @xmath152    the other terms present in eq.([densacel ] ) are trivial or equals the above result .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that @xmath153 and @xmath154    the nonlocal effects appear as power of @xmath155 which is expected to be small .",
    "thus , if the integrals in eq.([nl2 ] ) do not diverge , we can neglect the second order correction and keep just the linear term . to evaluate these integrals let us define @xmath156    the first integral can be directly integrated to give @xmath157 where we have used the property @xmath158 .",
    "note that only the constant term survives for long times since @xmath159 .",
    "the other integral can be recast as @xmath160 where @xmath161 is a dimensionless parameter .",
    "there is no analytical solution for this integral so we shall approximate @xmath162    as can be seen in figure  [ fig_approx ] , eq.([approx ] ) overestimate the integrant .",
    "therefore , if the integral converge with this approximation then eq.([iss ] ) will also converge .",

    "we have used @xmath164 . ]",
    "we can make a further approximation .",
    "recall that @xmath165 which generally is much smaller than 1 .",

    "therefore , the behavior of @xmath171 and @xmath169 given by eq.s  ( [ icceval ] ) and ( [ issapprox ] ) show that they do not diverge which allow us to neglect the quadratic terms in the nonlocal energy density . to conclude this analysis we need to calculate the two integral in eq.([eenl1 ] ) .",

    "<S> nonlocal electrodynamics is a formalism developed to include nonlocal effects in the measurement process caused by the non - inertial state of the observers . </S>",
    "<S> this theory modifies maxwell s electrodynamics by eliminating the hypothesis of locality that assumes an accelerated observer simultaneously equivalent to a comoving inertial frame of reference . in this scenario , </S>",
    "<S> the transformation between an inertial and accelerated observer is generalized which affects the properties of physical fields . in particular , we analyze how an uniformly accelerated observer perceives a homogeneous and isotropic blackbody radiation . </S>",
    "<S> we show that all nonlocal effects are transient and most relevant in the first period of acceleration . </S>"
