    "dual superconductivity of the vacuum has been advocated as the mechanism for confinement of colour@xcite : the chromoelectric field is channeled into abrikosov@xcite flux tubes , producing a static potential proportional to the distance between @xmath6 pairs .",
    "magnetic charges , defined as dirac monopoles of a residual @xmath4 symmetry selected by a suitable gauge fixing ( abelian projection ) , should accordingly condense in the vacuum , in the same way as cooper pairs do in an ordinary superconductor .",
    "evidence has been collected by numerical simulations of the theory on the lattice , that such monopoles do exist , and that their number density is correlated with the deconfining phase transition : we refer to@xcite for a review of these results . for a recent updating we refer to @xcite however a direct demonstration",
    "that confinement is produced by monopole condensation is still lacking .",
    "in fact monopole condensation means that the ground state of the system is a superposition of states with different magnetic charges , or that the dual ( magnetic ) @xmath4 symmetry is spontaneously broken , in the same way as the electric @xmath4 symmetry is spontaneously broken in a ordinary superconductor@xcite .",
    "such a breaking is monitored by the non vanishing of the vacuum expectation value ( _ vev _ ) of any operator @xmath7 with nontrivial magnetic charge .",
    "@xmath8 is called a disorder parameter : it is non zero in the broken phase , and vanishes in the ordered phase , at least in the thermodynamical limit @xmath9 .",
    "the construction of a disorder parameter for dual superconductivity has been presented in @xcite where it has been successfully tested on compact @xmath4 gauge theory .    in this paper",
    "we use the same construction to probe the vacuum condensation of the monopoles defined by abelian projection in @xmath0 gauge theory . we find that the abelian projection which diagonalizes the polyakov line@xcite , identifies monopoles which condense in the confined phase and do not in the deconfined one .",
    "monopoles defined by the abelian projection which diagonalizes a component of the field strength@xcite do not show any signal of condensation correlated with confinement .",
    "we conclude that :    * confinement of colour is related to dual superconductivity of gauge theory vacuum . *",
    "not all the abelian projections are equivalent , or define monopoles wich condense in the vacuum to confine colour .",
    "in sect.2 we recall the basic ideas of the abelian projection , the definition of the corresponding monopoles , and their role in confinement . in sect.3",
    "we present our results , in sect.4 the conclusions .",
    "stable monopoles configurations in gauge theories are related to the first homotopy group @xmath10 of the gauge group@xcite .",
    "since @xmath11 $ ] is trivial , the symmetry has to break down to some non simply connected subgroup , in order to define magnetic charges .    in the georgi - glashow@xcite model with gauge group",
    "@xmath0 coupled to a scalar field @xmath12 in the adjoint representation a spontaneous breaking @xmath13 allows to define an abelian field strength@xcite @xmath14 which admits stable monopole configuration@xcite , behaving as dirac monopoles at large distances . in eq.([eq2.1 ] ) @xmath15 . putting @xmath16 one has@xcite @xmath17 @xmath18 in eq.([eq2.1 ] ) is gauge invariant , since both @xmath19 and @xmath20 are gauge covariant .",
    "@xmath21 in eq.([eq2.2 ] ) is not . in the gauge in which @xmath22 eq.([eq2.3 ] )",
    "becomes @xmath23 eq.([eq2.5 ] ) is the usual expression of the electromagnetic field strength in terms of the ( abelian ) potential @xmath21 .",
    "the choice of the gauge eq.([eq2.4 ] ) , which is defined up to an arbitrary gauge rotation around the third axis , is called an abelian projection .",
    "the strategy for relating confinement of colour to dual superconductivity in q.c.d . is to make a guess of a possible effective higgs field @xmath24 , belonging to the adjoint representation , and then perform the abelian projection eq.([eq2.4 ] ) and look for condensation of the corresponding dirac monopoles .    in most of the lattice investigations on the problem , the density of monopoles , or quantities related to it ,",
    "have been studied : of course the density of magnetic charges is not a disorder parameter for dual superconductivity , in the same way as the number density of electrons is not for ordinary superconductivity : a non vanishing _ vev _ of an operator with non trivial charge is needed , while the density of charge commutes with total charge operator ( which is in fact neutral ) .",
    "we will instead make use of a genuine disorder parameter that we have constructed and checked on the @xmath4 gauge theory@xcite .",
    "another question is if all abelian projections are physically equivalent , a possibility suggested in@xcite .",
    "we will study the projection in which @xmath25 is the polyakov line , and the one in which @xmath19 is any component of the field strength @xmath20@xcite .    for reasons which will be explained in sect.3 , we have technical difficulties ( computing power ) to explore the so called maximal abelian gauge@xcite .",
    "as for the @xmath4 case@xcite we define the operator which creates a monopole at the point @xmath26 and time @xmath27 @xmath28 \\label{eq3.1}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the electric field strength eq.([eq2.1 ] ) and @xmath30 is the vector potential produced by a dirac monopole , with the dirac string subtracted .",
    "@xmath31 is given by @xmath32 if the gauge is chosen in such a way that the string singularity is in the direction @xmath33 .",
    "the equal time commutator between the vector potential @xmath34 ( eq.([eq2.2 ] ) and @xmath29 is @xmath35 = { \\rm i } \\delta_{kj}\\,\\delta^3(\\vec x - \\vec y ) \\label{eq3.3}\\ ] ] as in the @xmath4 gauge theory @xmath29 is the conjugate momentum to @xmath34 , and as a consequence @xmath7 ( eq.([eq3.1 ] ) ) is an operator which translates the field @xmath36 by @xmath37 .    a proper definition of the _ v.e.v . _ of @xmath7 is@xcite @xmath38\\,\\mu(\\vec z , z^0 ) }",

    "the ( known ) deconfining @xmath66 for the two lattices ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) is indicated by the vertical lines in figures 1 and 2 . in fig.3 @xmath69 of a @xmath62 pair at distance @xmath70 lattice spacing",
    "is compared to @xmath71 , corresponding to a single monopole , checking successfully eq.([eq3.18 ] ) .",
    "no signal is observed in the abelian projection which diagonalizes a component ( say @xmath72 ) of the field strength .",
    "a few points about the lattice version of the approach .",
    "@xmath29 of eq.([eq3.1 ] ) is defined by eq.([eq2.1 ] ) . for the abelian projection in which @xmath24 is the direction of log of the polyakov loop,@xmath73 , the second term in eq.([eq2.1 ] ) is absent when @xmath7 or @xmath74 take the value 0 , since @xmath75 .",
    "then constructing @xmath29 is simply a projection of @xmath76 on the direction of @xmath73 : of course on the lattice @xmath77 can be taken as the imaginary part of the plaquette @xmath78 .    for the abelian projection in which @xmath79 the second term of eq.([eq2.1 ] )",
    "is not zero , but is computable .    in the case of the so called `` maximal abelian gauge''@xcite , in which the gauge is fixed by maximizing the quantity @xmath80\\ ] ] the effective higgs @xmath19 to introduce in eq.([eq2.1 ] )",
    "is not known explicitely , but must be determined by the maximization on each configuration .",
    "this is a serious problem from the numerical point of view , since at each change of the configuration in the updating procedure to compute @xmath55 by eq.([eq3.14 ] ) the maximization must be repeated to determine @xmath29 and @xmath81 .",
    "a detailed finite size scaling analysis to extract the thermodinamical limit from our data is under study .",
    "we conclude that    * gauge theory vacuum is a dual superconductor : the monopoles defined by the abelian projection diagonalizing the polyakov line do condense in the confined phase , and the corresponding dual @xmath4 symmetry is restored in the deconfined phase . *",
    "not all abelian projections are physically equivalent : the monopoles in the gauge in which the field strength is diagonal are irrelevant to confinement .",
