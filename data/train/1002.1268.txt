    "graphene is a recently isolated material composed of carbon atoms arranged in a truly two - dimensional ( 2d ) honeycomb lattice  @xcite .",
    "states near the fermi energy of a graphene sheet are described by a massless dirac equation which has chiral states in which the honeycomb - sublattice pseudospin is aligned either parallel to or opposite to momentum . the dirac - like wave equation and the existence of this spin-@xmath0-like quantum degree - of - freedom",
    "have a number of very intriguing implications on the properties of this material , most of which have been reviewed in the literature mentioned above .",
    "graphene has been shown to possess a wealth of tantalizing electronic , mechanical , and optical properties and might well become the material that will replace silicon in the next generation devices  @xcite .",
    "current exfoliated samples however suffer from a limited mobility , with typical values around @xmath1 : the main source of disorder which is behind these numbers is not yet completely understood and represents a substantial obstacle against the quest for fundamental physical effects and the development of functional devices .",
    "the mechanism which is limiting the mobility of the current ( exfoliated ) samples is actually one of the controversial topics in this field of research .",
    "two  schools of thought \" can be roughly identified : ( i ) one which ascribes the main limiting mechanism to charged impurities located in the ( @xmath2 ) substrate  @xcite , and ( ii ) one which instead relies on other scattering mechanisms , such as quenched ripples  @xcite , which are also long - range in nature .",
    "ripples have been seen in suspended membranes  @xcite and also in flakes deposited on substrates  @xcite and have been studied theoretically by monte carlo  @xcite and molecular dynamics  @xcite simulations .",
    "the controversy is enriched by several experiments which have targeted the role of disorder in exfoliated samples  @xcite .",
    "in particular , bolotin _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite and du _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have observed a drastic increase in mobility in suspended samples , in agreement with a scenario in which charged impurities in the substrate are the main source of scattering .",
    "on the other hand , ponomarenko _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have studied exfoliated samples deposited on various substrates and found a rather weak dependence of the mobility on the type of substrate .",
    "the authors of ref .   have also studied transport in flakes embedded in media with very high dielectric constants , such as glycerol , ethanol , and water , and measured only a small increase in mobility .",
    "this experimental study seems thus to suggest that charged impurities are not necessarily the primary source of scattering in current samples . whatever the leading sources of disorder are , it is of utmost importance to understand how well or poorly these are screened by electrons in graphene .    the induced carrier density in graphene sheets subjected to the long - range potential of one or many charged impurities , in the absence or in the presence of electron - electron interactions , has been extensively studied theoretically  @xcite : to the best of our knowledge , similar microscopic studies in the presence of corrugations have not yet appeared .",
    "the aim of this article is to cover this gap : we present extensive self - consistent fully - quantum - mechanical calculations of the electronic density profiles of massless dirac fermions in the external scalar and vector potentials created by the corrugations .",
    "our main findings can be summarized as follows : ( i ) the spatial density fluctuations induced by the ripples are almost entirely controlled by the scalar potential , especially in graphene sheets that are close to average neutrality ; ( ii ) the contributions to the scalar and vector potentials due to in - plane atomic displacements are as large as those due to out - of - plane ones ; and ( iii ) exchange and correlation contributions to the effective scalar ( kohn - sham ) potential seem to play a minor role in determining the shape of the ripple - induced electron - hole puddles , at least in the range of parameters we have analyzed .",
    "this manuscript is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sect : one ] we discuss in detail how we have calculated scalar and vector potentials starting from a corrugated graphene sheet . in sect .",
    "[ sect : two ] we introduce the theory and the numerical procedure we have used to calculate the induced carrier density in the presence of the ripple - induced potentials and present our main numerical results . finally in sect .",
    "[ sect : three ] we draw our main conclusions .",
    "appendix  [ appendix ] reports some technical remarks on the calculation of the density induced by a purely vector potential within linear - response theory .",
    "the aim of this section is to describe how we have computed the scalar and vector potentials associated with ripples . for definiteness we focus our attention on ripples generated by thermal fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "the procedure we have followed is however completely general and applies to any type of ripples , independently of the microscopic , intrinsic or extrinsic , mechanisms that lie at their origin .       and the scalar and vector potentials shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : andopot ] .",
    "[ fig : sample ] ]    in what follows we consider a specific realization of a corrugated graphene sheet at a temperature @xmath3  k , computed with a monte carlo simulation as in ref .  .",
    "in fig .  [",
    "fig : sample ] we show the three - dimensional bond structure of the sample , which contains 19504 atoms and fulfills periodic boundary conditions in the simulation box .    the computation of the corrugation - induced scalar and vector potentials that we will carry out in sect .",
    "[ sect : oneb ] below requires the knowledge of the displacements @xmath4 of the atomic positions @xmath5 in the sample ( @xmath6 is the atomic label ) with respect to a flat reference distribution @xmath7 .",
    "the latter is defined by applying a dilation / contraction to the honeycomb lattice at @xmath8 .",
    "more precisely , we first make sure that the positions , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , of the center - of - mass of the two distributions coincide , and use in the following the displaced vectors @xmath11 .",
    "we then dilate / contract the honeycomb lattice at @xmath8 to compensate for the variation of the carbon - carbon bond length produced by the finite temperature .",
    "the coefficient @xmath12 in the transformation @xmath13 is obtained by averaging the ratio @xmath14 over all the atoms @xmath6 such that @xmath15   .",
    "the latter restriction reduces the impact of the fluctuations of the atomic positions , produced by the ripples , but does not affect the computation of the overall stretch / compression produced by the temperature .",
    "we find @xmath16 ( @xmath17 : the effect of temperature in this range is indeed to _ reduce _ the carbon - carbon bond length  @xcite ) . the variance of @xmath18 is of order @xmath19 , hence the stretch induced by the temperature is the dominant contribution of the atomic displacements from the positions of the bare honeycomb lattice .",
    "in other words , to prepare a sensible reference distribution it is essential to perform the aforementioned stretch , even if the factor @xmath12 is close to unity .    finally , we make sure that the sample and the reference distribution are not globally rotated with respect to each other .",
    "we compute the average angular displacement vector @xmath20 where the summation is restricted to the @xmath21 atoms such that the cosine of the angle between @xmath22 and @xmath23 is larger than @xmath24 . in the analyzed sample",
    "the modulus of @xmath25 is of order @xmath19 , hence we conclude that the sample and the reference distribution are properly aligned .",
    "we are now in position to compute the displacement vectors @xmath26 : thanks to the above mentioned preparation procedures , these will be free of artificial systematic trends and will provide us with an accurate local description of the ripples .    as we solve for the electronic density on a square mesh in the simulation box ( see the description of the method in sec .",
    "[ sect : twob ] ) , the knowledge of the displacement of each atom is superabundant .",
    "for this reason we average the atomic displacements over square patches defined on a square mesh . to show that this averaging yields indeed a correct modeling of the physical system , we observe that the problem possesses three length scales : ( i ) graphene s lattice constant @xmath27 ( here @xmath28    is the carbon - carbon distance ) , ( ii ) the length scale @xmath29 of the spatial structures in the specific sample shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sample ] , which is of the order of several nanometers ( @xmath30 ) ; and ( iii ) the spatial resolution @xmath31 which we have in our continuum - model electronic structure calculations [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : spa_resol ] ) ] . for a sample of roughly @xmath32 , as the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sample ] , @xmath33 ( see discussion below in sect .",
    "[ sect : twob ] ) . since @xmath34 , the structures in fig .",
    "[ fig : sample ] are properly resolved by the mean displacement vectors @xmath35 , obtained by averaging the microscopic displacements over square patches of area @xmath36 .",
    "the result of this averaging procedure for the sample in fig .",
    "[ fig : sample ] is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : displmesh ] where we have plotted @xmath35 as calculated on a square mesh with @xmath37 points .",
    "we remark that the in - plane displacements undergo strong variations between neighboring patches as a consequence of the fact that even the in - plane displacements of neighboring atoms in the sample do not present signatures of local correlations .",
    "( color online ) average displacements @xmath35 calculated as discussed in sect .  [ sect : onea ] .",
    "the color scale represents the @xmath38 component of the average displacements , varying from @xmath39    ( blue ) to @xmath40    ( red ) .",
    "the arrows , whose length has been multiplied by a factor ten for better visibility , represent the in - plane components of the average displacements . ]",
    "we now proceed to discuss how we have calculated the deformation tensor and the corrugation - induced scalar and vector potentials .",
    "we have calculated scalar @xmath41 and vector @xmath42 potentials according to the standard formulas of the theory of elasticity  @xcite : @xmath43 and @xmath44 where @xmath45 ( with @xmath46 ) is the usual deformation tensor , @xmath47 here @xmath48 with @xmath49 are the cartesian components of the average displacements . for the coupling constant @xmath50 we have used two values , @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( the latter value  @xcite , which is based on old transport data on graphite sample , seems largely overestimated  @xcite ) , while @xmath53 where @xmath54",
    ", @xmath55 is the nearest - neighbour hopping parameter , and @xmath56 for the shear @xmath57 and bulk @xmath58 moduli we have used the recently calculated values  @xcite , @xmath59  @xmath60 and @xmath61  @xmath60 , at a temperature @xmath62 .",
    "we thus find that @xmath63 at this temperature .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : andopot ] we illustrate scalar and vector potentials calculated using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : v1])-([eq : kappa ] ) above . while performing the calculation of @xmath41 and @xmath64 we have noticed that the derivatives of the average in - plane displacements @xmath65 are of @xmath66 , while the derivatives of the out - of - plane displacements @xmath67 are much bigger , @xmath68 .",
    "however , in the deformation tensor ( [ eq : deformation ] ) the latter enter only _",
    "quadratically_. we thus conclude that the contributions from in - plane and out - of - plane displacements are both of the same order , @xmath68 . as a result ,",
    "no evident correlations link the out - of - plane _ topographic _ corrugations [ _ i.e. _ the distribution of the out - of - plane average displacements @xmath69 shown in the color map in fig .",
    "[ fig : displmesh ] ] with the scalar and vector potentials illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : andopot ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     we clearly see how the smooth landscape of electron - hole puddles in the presence of charged impurities only ( top panel ) is dramatically affected by the presence of corrugations ( bottom panel ) , which induce additional spatial variations with a much smaller length scale ( probably well below the current spatial experimental resolution of probes like set  @xcite or stm  @xcite ) .",
    "once again , we would like to emphasize that these small - wavelength carrier - density oscillations are due to a complicated interference between the effects of out - of - plane _ and _ in - plane atomic displacements .",
    "in summary , we have presented quantitative calculations of scalar and vector potentials induced by corrugations in single - layer graphene sheets .",
    "we have found that the contributions from in - plane and out - of - plane atomic displacements are both of the same order and that this does not lead to evident correlations between the out - of - plane topographic corrugations and the induced scalar and vector potentials .    we have then used these potentials to calculate self - consistently the induced electronic density distribution in the presence of electron - electron interactions . to this end",
    "we have generalized the kohn - sham - dirac theory of ref .   to treat situations with spatial - dependent vector potentials .",
    "we have discovered that spatial density fluctuations are largely controlled by the scalar potential , especially in nearly - neutral graphene sheets , and that this creates complicated short - wavelength ( a few @xmath70 ) electron - hole puddles which do not exhibit evident correlations with the topography of the sheet .    in the future",
    "we would like to investigate more deeply the role of the exchange - correlation corrections to the vector potential  @xcite , especially in view of the fact that the exchange - correlation contribution to the scalar kohn - sham potential , which has been studied here , has been found to play a minor role .",

    "in this appendix we demonstrate that within lrt an external vector potential does not induce density modulations in a system of noninteracting massless dirac fermions ( mdfs ) .",
    "we consider the following hamiltonian ( @xmath71 in this appendix ) : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the mdf kinetic hamiltonian and @xmath74 @xmath75 being a weak perturbing vector potential acting on the system . here",
    "we have introduced the well - known mdf current operator  @xcite @xmath76 the perturbing vector potential could in principle induce not only a current but also a density modulation . within lrt",
    "the induced density can be written in the form  @xcite @xmath77 where @xmath78\\rangle_0~,\\ ] ] with @xmath79 , is the density - current linear response function . for a homogeneous and isotropic system",
    "this relation takes a much simpler form when written in fourier transform with respect to space and time : @xmath80 with @xmath81 .",
    "here we have introduced the kubo product  @xcite @xmath82\\rangle_0~.\\ ] ]    from symmetry arguments @xmath83 must transform as a vector : since @xmath84 is the only vector available we have @xmath85 where @xmath86 depends only on the magnitude @xmath87 of the vector @xmath84 . thus eq .",
    "( [ eq : dens1 ] ) becomes @xmath88 this result implies that only longitudinal vector potentials can produce a density response .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath86 is straightforward . indeed , taking @xmath89 along the @xmath90-direction , we have @xmath91\\rangle_0 + \\frac{q}{\\omega } \\langle\\langle \\hat \\jmath^{~x}_{\\bm q};\\hat \\jmath^{~x}_{-\\bm q}\\rangle\\rangle_{\\omega } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{\\omega } \\langle[\\hat \\jmath^{~x}_{\\bm q},\\hat n_{-\\bm q}]\\rangle_0   + \\frac{q}{\\omega }   \\chi_{\\rm l } ( q , \\omega ) \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{\\omega}{q } \\chi_{n n}(q,\\omega)~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the density - density  @xcite and longitudinal current - current  @xcite response functions , respectively . in eq .",

    "thus , assuming continuity of the response function , relation ( [ eq : rel ] ) can be extrapolated to the static limit ( @xmath96 ) and implies that a static vector potential does not give rise to density modulations , since @xmath97 for readers who feel uncomfortable with the properties of kubo products we remark that eq .",
