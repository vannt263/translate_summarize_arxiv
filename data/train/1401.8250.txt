    "however , the possible association of the fermi gamma - ray bubbles with sgr a * implies that periods of increased accretion onto sgr a * may produce powerful outflow and jet driven activity ( zubovas and nayakshin 2012 ) .",
    "this activity requires high accretion rate and a reservoir of gaseous material feeding sgr a*.    indeed , there is evidence for an accretion event occurring a few million years ago in the form of one or perhaps two counter - rotating disks of young massive stars orbiting between 0.04 and 0.4pc of sgr a*. the stellar ages and total mass are estimated to be @xmath11 myr and @xmath12 , respectively ( paumard et al .  2006 ;",

    "this suggests a picture in which a byproduct of this process was the accretion of gas by sgr a * , and that the associated outburst provides the needed energetics to produce the fermi bubbles ( zubovas , king & nayakshin 2011 ; zubovas & nayakshin 2012 ) .",

    "we re - examine this issue in the context of the compact disks formed by partial cloud capture when an extended cloud temporarily engulfs sgr a * while on a passage through the central few parsec of the galaxy .",
    "previous simple analytic estimates show that @xmath16@xmath17 of gas settles into a sub - parsec disc ( wy08 , wy12 ) . here",

    "we begin our analysis by estimating the surface density profile of the cloud material as it circularizes , cools and settles into a disk .",

    "cloud material with impact parameter less than the critical value @xmath21 is captured , where we adopt @xmath22 for the mass of sgr a*. partial hoyle - lyttelton - like angular momentum cancellation between material passing on opposite sides of sgr a * leading to the formation of a sub - parsec disk with mass @xmath16@xmath17 ( wy08 ) . during the process of circularization , the components of angular momentum perpendicular to the eventual disk s rotation axis",

    "we assume that on average each fluid element ends up with a fraction @xmath23 of its original specific angular momentum parallel to the final rotation axis .",

    "here we generalise the w08 model by setting @xmath29 for some @xmath30 .",
    "the physical motivation for this prescription is that cancellation should become less effective for material with larger impact parameters because of the cloud s internal structure .",
    "we can then estimate the disk s surface density profile @xmath31 by equating the mass of captured gas with impact parameters in the range @xmath32 $ ] , i.e.   @xmath33 , to the mass of disk material at radii in @xmath34 $ ] , i.e.  @xmath35 , with the prescription for angular momentum loss yielding @xmath36 .",

    "note that the mass , radius and profile are broadly consistent with the inferred @xmath1 stellar profile , for reasonable parameters of the incoming cloud .",
    "for example , a cloud column density @xmath42 @xmath43 and velocity 120 yields @xmath44 and @xmath45pc .",
    "the fate of the disk is determined by the competition between heating and radiative cooling .",
    "heating by starlight or dissipation of magnetically - driven turbulence may keep the disk warm enough that self gravity is not important .",
    "should the temperature drop to the point that toomre s parameter @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the orbital frequency and @xmath48 is the sound speed , the disk will fragment if it can quickly radiate away the thermal energy liberated during gravitational collapse , i.e. @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the local cooling time scale ( gammie 2001 ) and we adopt @xmath51 , as suggested by simulations of self - gravitating disks ( see the review by lodato 2012 and references therein ) . , and it may even be that fragmentation happens stochastically for any value of @xmath52 ( pardekooper 2012 ; rice et al .  2012 ; meru & bate 2012 ) .",

    "] however , if cooling is inefficient the disk enters a `` gravitoturbulent '' state in which self - gravity continually perturbs the density and velocity field , and heating via dissipation of weak turbulence maintains @xmath54 ( paczynski 1978 ; gammie 2001 ; rafikov 2009 ) .",
    "we first consider radiative losses , which depend on the optical depth @xmath55 between the mid plane and surface , @xmath56 , which here is much larger than unity .",
    "for @xmath57k we adopt the piecewise power - law opacities provided in table 1 of zhu et al .",
    "( 2009 ) . as these do not include icy grains which dominate below 150k at lower temperatures we follow rafikov ( 2009 ) in adopting @xmath58 where @xmath59 is in kelvin , which approximates the calculations of semenov et al .",
    "the radiated power per unit area is @xmath60 the sum of @xmath61 from each of the upper and lower surfaces .",
    "cooling in a self - gravitating disk occurs at constant pressure @xmath62 ( paczynski 1978 ) , yielding a time scale @xmath63 where we have adopted adiabatic index @xmath64 , appropriate for warm molecular gas .",
    "turning now to heating processes , accretion at rate @xmath65 yields a dissipative power @xmath66 per unit area of the disk ( e.g.  pringle 1981 ) .",
    "we parametrize the accretion rate in the standard fashion using the @xmath67 parameter : @xmath68 for gravitoturbulence , @xmath67 is just that required to maintain @xmath69 ( paczynski 1978 ) . setting @xmath70 , and using eqs ( [ eqn : tcool]),([eqn : d]),([eqn : dotm ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath71 ( cf .",
    "gammie 2001 ) .    alternatively , accretion will be driven by magnetic stresses if the level of ionization is sufficient . as in protostellar disks ( e.g.  gammie 1996 ;",
    "wardle 2007 ) , external ionizing sources such as cosmic rays , x - rays and uv are ineffective , and coupling can only be sustained by thermal ionization of potassium , magnesium and sodium which becomes effective above @xmath72k ( e.g. umebayashi 1983 ) .",
    "when this is the case , shear in the disk maintains a strong azimuthal magnetic field developed from the incoming cloud s pre - existing field , and this efficiently transports angular momentum , yielding @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the disc thickness and @xmath75@xmath76 ( gaburov at al .",
    "2012 ; bai & stone 2013 ) .",
    "crucially , the magnetic pressure in the disk is about an order of magnitude larger than the gas pressure , inflating the disk so that @xmath77 .",
    "in addition , for a given temperature and column density , the volume density and hence the effective value of @xmath78 are all reduced by a factor of three .",
    "thus when the temperature exceeds 900k , we set @xmath79    the disk would also have been heated by hot stars lying within a few parsec of sgr a * , which at present have a net luminosity @xmath80 ( krabbe et al 1995 ; latvakoski et al 1999 ) .",
    "as many of these stars were presumably created by fragmentation of the disk we adopt half of the present - day value , i.e. @xmath81 as a rough estimate of the heating rate per unit area , independent of distance from sgr a*.",
    "we first consider how the disk s fate at @xmath82pc depends on the local column density , with the aim of determining the column that would place the inner boundary of the fragmentation region there ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "if @xmath83g@xmath43 , the high optical depth allows magnetic heating to maintain the temperature above 900k , and thermal ionization allows continued magnetic activity . inflation by magnetic pressure then implies that @xmath84 and as this corresponds to temperatures below 600k we conclude that self - gravity is unimportant . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath85g@xmath43 magnetic heating is unable to maintain the temperature above 900k , thermal ionization is insufficient to couple the magnetic field to the gas , magnetic activity shuts down , and @xmath86 . for @xmath87g@xmath43",
    "stellar radiation keeps the disk hot enough to avoid becoming self - gravitating , whereas at higher column densities the disk is able to cool to the point that self - gravity is important , and between @xmath88 and @xmath89g@xmath43 the disk cools rapidly enough to fragment .    fig .  3",
    "shows how the disk behavior depends on column density and distance from sgr a*. in general , high surface densities are unstable to fragmentation , while low surface densities are neither able to fragment nor to accrete because stellar heating maintains @xmath90 but with @xmath91k so that magnetic coupling is ineffective . within about 0.05pc of sgr a * there is an intermediate range of column densities for which magnetic activity maintains @xmath92k and prevents fragmentation .",
    "note that disks are gravitoturbulent over a severely limited range of radii and surface densities .",
    "the blue dashed curve shows the surface density profile ( eq 3 ) for a disk mass @xmath93 , corresponding to @xmath94g@xmath43 at 0.04pc , so that the inner boundary of the fragmentation region is at 0.04pc , consistent with the hole in the stellar distribution around sgr a*. in light of the very rapid cooling we expect that the gas will fragment well before settling into the well - ordered disk we implicitly assume here , producing a dynamically warm stellar distribution .",
    "fragmentation very near the outer edge of the disk may be prevented by stellar heating , although the exact profile of the disk edge and the stellar heating rate are both rather uncertain .",
    "such a disk would be magnetically active interior to 0.04 pc , with initial accretion rates 0.010.03yr@xmath9 , as indicated by the red contours in fig .",
    "3 .    fig .",
    "4 shows the radial structure of this disk .",
    "the top panel compares the temperatures maintained by magnetic activity and stellar heating with those at which the disk becomes self - gravitating and the cooling time scale is 3 or 10 @xmath95 .",
    "the lower panel of fig .  4 shows the radial profile of surface density and optical depth .",
    "the latter is calculated for the equilibrium temperature maintained by magnetic dissipation within 0.04pc , or the temperature corresponding to @xmath96 at larger radii .",
    "the discontinuities in optical depth arise due to evaporation of ice mantles at 150k , the sublimation of grains at @xmath97k , and collisional dissociation of water at @xmath98k .",
    "the fragmentation region contains about @xmath99 of gas , consistent with estimates of the stellar mass in the disk ( lu et al .",
    "the characteristic initial fragment mass is @xmath100 , but this is expected to grow by about an order of magnitude by collisions ( levin & beloborodov 2003 ) .",
    "meanwhile the disk within 0.04 pc exhibits accretion rates @xmath1010.03yr@xmath9 , with accretion time scales @xmath1023myr that are an order of magnitude shorter than previously estimated ( alexander et al .",
    "2012 ) because of the enhancement by magnetic levitation .",
    "we have examined in more detail the earlier proposal in which gas clouds engulfing supermassive black holes leave behind a captured disk ( wy08 , wy12 ) . the angular momentum cancellation inherent in this scenario naturally produces steep ( @xmath103 ) surface density profiles consistent with the observed stellar disk , with @xmath104@xmath105  and size @xmath106pc ( w08 ) . for reasonable parameters we found that such a captured disk would indeed be unstable to fragmentation between 0.04 and 0.4pc , consistent with the sizes of the observed stellar disks . between 0.01 and 0.04pc dissipation of magnetically - driven turbulence",
    "prevents the disk from becoming self - gravitating and enables accretion with @xmath107@xmath108 .",
    "the magnetized accretion disk that arises in the central 0.04pc explains the central 1@xmath2 hole in the stellar distribution ( cf .",
    "alexander et al .",
    "2012 ) . of significance here",
    "is that because magnetic pressure dominates gas pressure ( gaburov et al .",
    "2012 ) , thickening the disk and increasing the turbulent velocities by a factor of three , the accretion rate is an order of magnitude larger than in `` standard '' accretion disk models ( e.g.  alexander at al .",
    "this increases the plausibility of accretion models for the origin of the fermi bubbles , notably by reducing the accretion time scale to a few million years , enabling significant accretion to occur between formation of the stellar population and the fermi bubbles .",
    "the energy released by such an event is uncertain . the current accretion rate onto sgr a *",
    "is thought to be @xmath109 and the bolometric luminosity @xmath110 ( see genzel , eisenhauer & gillesen 2010 and references therein ) , yielding an efficiency @xmath111 .",
    "if the accretion of @xmath112 is to power the fermi bubble then it must produce @xmath113erg ; the corresponding efficiency is @xmath114 , indicating that the efficiency of this accretion mode must be significantly higher than at present .    the feeding of molecular gas into the central 100pc of the galaxy is thought to be ongoing and related to the presence of the galactic bar ( e.g. morris & serabyn 1996 ) .",
    "infall of molecular gas into the central few parsec of the galaxy appears to be continual , and so partial capture of gas clouds by sgr a * may be quite common .",
    "the cloud capture event responsible for the formation of the stellar disk , and potentially the fermi bubble , occurred within the last few million years and added 1% to the mass of sgr a * and a similar mass to the local stellar population ; such events may have contributed significantly to the growth of sgr a * and the surrounding stellar population over the life time of the galaxy .    this scenario may also apply to gas accretion by smbh in external galaxies , where it has been argued that the difficulties in fuelling agn through an extended accretion disk imply that black holes are fed by a series of small gas capture events that create a sub-0.1pc accretion disk ( goodman 2003 ; king & pringle 2007 ) .",
    "the partial cloud capture model predicts a quadratic dependence of the disk mass on black hole mass ( wy12 ) .",
    "recent studies suggest a correlation between star formation rate and average black hole accretion rate in star forming galaxies ( e.g. , chen et al . 2013 ) .",
    "in addition , there is evidence for @xmath4-ray emission from starburst galaxies such as m82 and ngc 253 ( abdo et al 2010 ) .",
    "this correlation and the energetic activity associated with starburst galaxies can be understood as arising through simultaneous star formation and accretion during a series of cloud capture events over the lifetime of the central black hole .",
