    "econophysics is the study of economic systems by employing methods and tools developed in physics . up to now , many economists have been worrying that econophysicists are just reinventing the wheel ; while many physicists are studying properties of toy economic models that are not directly relevant to economics  @xcite . in this paper , we investigate the inequality of wealth in a simple - minded econophysical model known as the minority game ( mg ) using the so - called replica trick  @xcite . by doing so",
    ", we hope to make a small step forward in the application of physical methods when studying real economic systems .",
    "the mg is a simple - minded model of a complex adaptive system which captures the cooperative behavior of selfish players in a real market . in this game ,",
    "@xmath0 players have to choose one of the two possible alternatives in each turn based only on the minority sides in the previous @xmath1 turns .",
    "the wealth of those who end up in the minority side will be increased by one while the wealth of the others will be reduced by one . to aid the players in making their choice ,",
    "each of them is randomly and independently assigned @xmath2 deterministic strategies once and for all when the game begins .",
    "each deterministic strategy is nothing but a map from the set of all possible histories ( a string of the minority side of the previous @xmath1 turns ) to the set of the two possible alternatives .",
    "all players make their choices according to their current best strategies  @xcite . in the mg , the complexity of the system",
    "is usually indicated by the control parameter @xmath3 which is the ratio of the size of the strategy space to the size of strategies at play  @xcite .    clearly , the mean attendance of either choice is @xmath4 as the game is symmetrical for both choices .",
    "in contrast , the variance of this probability , which is conventionally denoted by @xmath5 , is highly non - trivial .",
    "it attains a very small value when @xmath6 , indicating that the players are cooperating  @xcite . that is why previous studies of the mg and its variants  @xcite focus mainly on the study of @xmath5 .",
    "since the strategies are assigned once and for all to each player , it is possible that some poorly - performing players are somehow forced to cooperate with some well - performing peers .",
    "therefore , it makes sense to study the inequality of wealth in mg in detail .    in section  [ gini_formula ] , we introduce a common method that measures wealth inequality in economics known as the modified gini index .",
    "we then study the gini index in the mg numerically in section  [ num_re ] .",
    "our numerical simulation shows that both the maximal cooperation point and the point of maximum wealth inequality occur around @xmath7 .",
    "this confirms our suspicion that the apparent cooperation of players shown in the @xmath5 does not tell us the complete story .",
    "in fact , we are able to explain the trend of a modified gini index qualitatively using the crowd - anticrowd theory  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "we find that the cooperation comes along with wealth inequality partially because poorly - performing players can not change their strategies in the mg . in this way",
    ", we show that the crowd - anticrowd theory is not only able to explain @xmath5 , but also explains other features of other quantities in the mg . in section  [ replica ] , we try to reproduce our numerically simulated gini index in the so - called asymmetric phase using the replica method .",
    "we recall that one has to average over the disorder variables in the conventional replica method ; the direct application of the replica trick can not provide the wealth distribution of players and thus the gini index of the mg .",
    "fortunately , a careful semi - analytic application of the replica method can be used to reproduce the gini index qualitatively as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "finally , we wrap up by giving a brief summary of our work in section  [ con ] .",
    "in order to measure the inequality of wealth among players in the mg qualitatively , we follow our economics colleagues employing the so - called gini index . in the original definition ,",
    "the gini index @xmath9 in a population is the mean of the absolute differences between the wealth all possible pairs of players  @xcite .",
    "that is to say , @xmath10 g_j.\\ ] ] in the above equation , @xmath0 is the number of players in the population , @xmath11 is the wealth earned by a player divided by the total wealth in the population . and",
    "the @xmath11 s are ranked in ascending order , i.e. , @xmath12 . clearly , @xmath9 ranges from @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "the larger @xmath9 , the more serious the wealth inequality . if @xmath15 , the players wealth is uniformly distributed .",
    "if @xmath16 , one of the players possesses the total wealth of the population and the wealth inequality is served .",
    "however , eq .  ( [ ogini_eq ] ) is only applicable in two cases : ( 1 ) all players have positive wealth ; or ( 2 ) all players have negative wealth .",
    "since players in the mg may have positive or negative wealth , we can not use @xmath9 , in general , to measure wealth inequality .",
    "we employ an extension of @xmath9 , introduced by chen _",
    "et al . _ , known as the modified gini index @xmath17  @xcite , is given by @xmath18 } , \\ ] ] where @xmath19 is defined in such a way that @xmath20 and @xmath21 . for simplicity , we refer to the modified gini index @xmath17 as the gini index from now on . just like the original gini index @xmath9 ,",
    "the modified gini index @xmath17 measures the normalized wealth inequality of players .",
    "again , @xmath17 ranges from @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "the larger the value of @xmath17 , the more serious the wealth inequality . when all players are equally wealthy , i.e. , @xmath22 , the term @xmath23 vanishes and @xmath17 becomes zero .",
    "in contrast , if the total wealth of the system is owned by a single player , i.e. , @xmath24 and the term @xmath25 , then @xmath17 attains a value of one as @xmath26 .",
    "also , @xmath17 is reduced to the original gini index @xmath9 when all players have positive wealth or all players have negative wealth .",
    "moreover , @xmath17 is unchanged if the wealth of each player is multiplied by a non - zero constant .",
    "in this section , we investigate the wealth inequality of the players in the mg . since we are only interested in studying the generic properties of the gini index , we average the gini index over @xmath27 independent runs .",
    "because @xmath17 measures the normalized wealth distribution of players rather than simply the first and second moments of this distribution , the time of convergence of gini index @xmath17 is much longer than that of the variance of attendance and it differs for different initial configurations of the system .",
    "so we employ an adaptive scheme to check for system equilibration before taking any measurement .",
    "specifically , in each run , we record the time series of @xmath17 until the absolute difference of @xmath17 between @xmath28 successive steps is less than @xmath29 .",
    "then , we obtain the equilibrated value of @xmath17 by using finite size scaling . finally , we take @xmath17 to be the average over @xmath30 measurements each separated by @xmath31 steps .",
    "we recall from section  [ gini_formula ] that @xmath17 is a measure of the normalized wealth distribution . from our numerical simulation",
    ", @xmath17 equilibrates logarithmically and slowly although the wealth of players is decreasing in each turn .",
    "we will explain the reason for convergence of @xmath17 in detail at the end of this section .",
    "we have performed numerical simulations for the cases where players draw their strategies from full strategy space and reduced strategy space  @xcite respectively .",
    "the gini indices obtained in these two cases are very similar . since the analytical investigation performed in section  [ replica ] is simpler if we focus on reduced strategy space , we present the numerical results based on reduced strategy space here for consistency .",
    "let us study the gini index averaged over the initial conditions @xmath32 versus the control parameter @xmath8 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] .",
    "( note that we use @xmath33 to denote the average over the initial configuration of the system . )",
    "our numerical results show that the curves of @xmath32 for different @xmath1 coincide . which means that the gini index @xmath34 , just like the variance of attendance , depends only on the control parameter @xmath8 in the mg .",
    "we now move on to discuss the properties of the gini index @xmath32 as a function of @xmath8 in detail .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] shows that the gini index @xmath34 is small when @xmath35 . in other words ,",
    "the wealth of all players is roughly the same in such a case .",
    "in fact , the small value of @xmath34 can be explained by the crowd - anticrowd theory  @xcite as follows . in the small @xmath8 regime , players are likely to have at least one high ranking strategy at each instance , as each player possesses a relatively large portion of strategies of the reduced strategy space .",
    "thus , most of the players are using the crowd of high ranking strategies , i.e. , those high ranking strategies are overcrowded . due to the overcrowding of strategies , each strategy alternatively wins and loses one virtual score repeatedly when the same history appears , under the period - two dynamics @xcite .",
    "that is to say , each strategy has approximately the same probability to win for any history .",
    "therefore , all players have roughly the same amount of wealth and this leads to a small gini index @xmath34 .",
    "as the control parameter @xmath8 increases , the gini index @xmath32 rises rapidly and subsequently attains its maximum value when the number of strategies at play is approximately equal to the reduced strategy space size . to explain this",
    ", we recall that the aim of each player in the mg is to maximize one s own wealth , which is achieved under the maximization of the global profit  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the attendance of each choice always tends to @xmath36 upon equilibration for all values of @xmath8 since the two alternatives are symmetric in the mg .",
    "that is to say , the system always `` distributes '' approximately the same amount of wealth to the population in each turn regardless of the value of @xmath8",
    ". moreover , whenever @xmath37 , unlike in the cases of symmetric and asymmetric phases of the mg , it is not uncommon for a player to hold only low ranking strategies since the number of strategies at play and the reduced strategy space size are of the same order .",
    "consequently , a significant number of players are forced to use the crowd of low ranking strategies and keep on losing . on the other hand ,",
    "those players picking the crowd of high ranking strategies have a higher winning probability and keep on using those strategies .",
    "note that the ranking of the strategies is almost unchanged when @xmath37  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the wealth distribution of players would become relatively diverse and the gini index @xmath34 of the population attains its maximum value when @xmath38 .",
    "actually , the increase in the gini index when @xmath39 can be justified by the frozen probability of the mg . we recall that in the mg a player employs the virtual score system to determine which strategy to use in the next time step . in the asymmetric phase , the probability that a strategy assigned to a player has a virtual score asymptotically higher than all the other strategies assigned to the same player increases as @xmath8 decreases .",
    "some players end up using only one strategy after the system equilibrates , they are regard as frozen players .",
    "the frozen probability indicates the number of frozen players . a small frozen probability ,",
    "i.e. most players in the game keep changing their best strategies , implies that only a few player will keep on winning or keep on losing all the time and the gini index should be low . on the other hand ,",
    "a high frozen probability may indicate that while some frozen players are using strategies that win most of time , the best performing strategies for the other frozen players are losing badly .",
    "thus , there is a wide spread in wealth distribution of players .",
    "the gini index should be high in this case .",
    "the frozen probability follows the same trend of gini index as @xmath40 , which further supports the validity of the result of the gini index .",
    "moreover , when @xmath37 , it is likely that those frozen players which form the majority of crowds and anti - crowds in the game use anti - correlated strategy pairs , resulting in effective crowd - anticrowd cancellation between frozen players . also , those frozen players who picked the anti - correlated strategy pairs keep winning or keep losing throughout the game .    after attaining the maximum value ,",
    "the gini index @xmath34 decreases and gradually tends to zero when the control parameter @xmath8 further increases . according to crowd - anticrowd theory  @xcite ,",
    "it is because most of the strategies at play are uncorrelated to each other when the strategy space size becomes much larger than the number of strategies at play .",
    "therefore , it is as if each player is making random choices in the game when @xmath8 is large .",
    "hence , the winning probability of all strategies is roughly the same . as a result ,",
    "the gini index @xmath34 of the population is small in this regime .    as we have reasoned above",
    ", the winning probability of each individual player is steady after equilibration of the system .",
    "since the wealth distribution depends solely on the winning probabilities of individual players , the @xmath11 s , and hence the gini index @xmath17 , converge over a sufficiently long time .",
    "moreover , it is easy to check that the @xmath11 s converge logarithmically . therefore , the equilibration time for @xmath17 is much longer than that of @xmath41 .",
    "in the previous section , we have explained the wealth inequality of the players in the mg qualitatively .",
    "in fact , the system of the mg can be described as a disorder spin system  @xcite since the dynamics of the mg indeed minimizes a global function related to market predictability . in this section ,",
    "we calculate the gini index @xmath17 of the population in mg semi - analytically by mapping the mg to a spin glass .",
    "as we shall see , this approach works well whenever @xmath42 .",
    "let us start to link the mg , a repeated game with @xmath0 players , to the spin glass . in this formalism",
    ", every player has to choose one out of two actions @xmath43 corresponding to the two alternatives at each time step .",
    "we denote the action of the @xmath44th player at time @xmath45 by @xmath46 .",
    "after all players have chosen their actions , those players choosing the minority action win and gain one unit of wealth while all the others lose one . in the mg ,",
    "the only public information available to the players is the so - called history , which is the string of the minority action of the last @xmath1 time steps .",
    "namely , the history is a string , @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the minority action at time @xmath45 . for convenience",
    ", we label the history by an index @xmath49 as follows : @xmath50 at the beginning of the game , each player picks once and for all @xmath2 strategies randomly from the strategy space .",
    "in fact , a strategy specifies an action @xmath51 taken by the @xmath44th player for all possible histories @xmath52 . in the mg ,",
    "agents make use of the virtual score , i.e. , the hypothetical profit for using a strategy throughout the game , to evaluate the performance of a strategy .",
    "to guess the next global minority action , each player uses their own current best strategy which is the strategy with the highest virtual score at that moment .",
    "assuming each player has @xmath53 strategies which are labeled by @xmath54 and @xmath55 , we define the disorder variables \\{@xmath56 , @xmath57 } as : @xmath58 here we use the spin variable @xmath59 to denote the strategy used by the @xmath44th player at time @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the action of this player is given by @xmath60 with the above formalism , we can employ a statistical tool called the replica trick  @xcite to study the stationary state properties of the mg by solving the ground state of the hamiltonian @xmath61 : @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "note that @xmath65 denotes the average over history @xmath49 and @xmath66 denotes the average over time @xmath45 .",
    "in other words , our aim is to find the minimum of @xmath67 defined by : @xmath68^n } h\\{\\vec{m}\\ } = - \\lim_{\\beta \\rightarrow       \\infty } \\frac{1}{\\beta } \\langle \\ln z ( \\beta ) \\rangle_\\xi,\\ ] ] where the partition function @xmath69 here , @xmath70 denotes the integral of @xmath71 on @xmath72^n$ ] , @xmath73 denotes the average over the disorder variables @xmath74 ( i.e. , the quenched disorder @xmath75 of the system ) and @xmath76 stands for the inverse temperature . in fact , the ground state solution of @xmath61 depends on the disorder variables",
    ". however , in the thermodynamic limit , the ground state of @xmath61 has a unique solution for all quenched disorder .",
    "thus , in the replica calculation , we seek for ground state solution of the hamiltonian @xmath61 on average of the quenched disorder . in order to evaluate @xmath77",
    ", we construct the partition function @xmath78 by studying @xmath79 ( a non - negative integer ) replicas of the system with identical disorder variables @xmath80 .",
    "then , we perform a semi - analytical continuation to extend this function for non - integer @xmath79 . in this way",

    "hence , we can find the stationary state solution of @xmath61 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath87 by finding the minima of @xmath83 as : @xmath88^n } \\frac{h\\{m\\}}{n }      \\approx \\lim_{\\beta \\rightarrow \\infty } \\lim_{n \\rightarrow 0 } \\min       f_\\beta(\\hat{q},\\hat{r}).\\ ] ]    in fact , we can find the minima in the replica symmetric ( @xmath89 ) ansatz by solving the saddle point equations  @xcite : @xmath90 in this ansatz , the matrices @xmath91 , @xmath92 corresponding to @xmath93 , are assumed to be in the following form : @xmath94 and @xmath95 for all @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , using the @xmath89 ansatz , the minimum value of @xmath97 in the @xmath98 limit is given by @xmath99 + \\frac{\\alpha ( 1 + q)}{2 [ \\alpha + \\beta ( q - q ) ] }      - \\frac{1}{\\beta } \\int d \\phi(\\lambda ) \\ln \\left [ \\int_{-1}^{1 } d m       \\exp ( - \\beta v(m|\\lambda ) ) \\right ] + \\frac{\\alpha \\beta}{2 } ( rq - rq ) ,      \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath100 is the normal distribution and the potential @xmath101 .",
    "using the saddle point equations , we arrive at  @xcite @xmath102 where @xmath103 is a disorder variable and depends on the control parameter @xmath8 .",
    "the probability distribution of the ` average action ' of a player , @xmath104 , is then given by  @xcite @xmath105 +   \\frac{\\rho}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi } } e^ { - ( \\rho m ) ^2 / 2 } , \\label{m_dis}\\ ] ] where @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 whenever @xmath109 .",
    "note that eqs .",
    "( [ rho ] ) and  ( [ m_dis ] ) are only valid for @xmath42 . for @xmath110 ,",
    "the replica calculation can not give correct predictions for the probability distribution of spin variable @xmath104 because it is unable to reproduce the period - two dynamics of the system  @xcite .",
    "our aim is to calculate the gini index of the players in the mg using the replica trick . at first glance",
    ", one might argue that the distribution of @xmath111 can be reproduced analytically using the replica trick .",
    "however , the replica trick can only generate the average gain of a group of players rather than the wealth of an individual player .",
    "this is why challet did not compute the theoretical gain of individual players analytically by using the replica trick for the mg .",
    "in fact , he computes the gain semi - analytically using the disorder spin variable @xmath112 measured in the simulations instead  @xcite . to reproduce the wealth distribution of players , we need to know the actions of each individual player @xmath113 at time @xmath45 for each individual particular quenched disorder .",
    "however , @xmath113 can not be found by the replica trick .",
    "so we approximate @xmath113 by the disorder spin variable @xmath112 generated stochastically from the distribution @xmath114 which is found by the replica trick .",
    "then , the gini index @xmath115 can be calculated from the wealth distribution of the players for that quenched disorder .",
    "as we are only interested in the generic properties of the gini index , we calculate the gini index averaged over quenched disorder @xmath32 .",
    "this should be done by calculating the gini index of each individual quenched disorder @xmath115 first and then taking average over all quenched disorders .",
    "in practice , we perform the stochastic simulation to generate the wealth distribution of population in the mg for an individual quenched disorder in the following way . before starting the simulation ,",
    "the quenched disorder @xmath75 is formed by allowing each player to pick two strategies randomly from the reduced strategy space .",
    "next , each player draws the spin variable @xmath104 from the distribution @xmath114 as shown in eq .",
    "( [ m_dis ] ) . those players with @xmath116",
    "are called frozen players because they keep on using a strategy throughout the game . then , in each step of the game , players choose one of their own strategies according to their own spin variable @xmath104 to guess the next global minority side . in practice , the strategy used by the @xmath44th player at time @xmath45 , @xmath117 , is chosen by calling a uniform random variate @xmath118 on @xmath72 $ ]",
    ". then we set @xmath119 if @xmath120 and @xmath121 otherwise .",

    "then we calculate the average gini index for @xmath129 independent runs .",
    "we denote the gini index calculated by this algorithm with averaging over the quenched disorder by @xmath130 .",
    "in fact , we find that the average gini index @xmath34 converges after @xmath131 iterations , where @xmath132 is the number of possible histories .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] gives the gini index obtained from semi - analytical calculation of @xmath130 versus the control parameter @xmath8 for mg with @xmath42 .",
    "we find that the trend of the curves of @xmath133 agrees with the numerical findings .",
    "this implies that we have successfully reproduced the numerical results of the gini index in the asymmetric phase of the mg by using the replica method .",
    "however , the curves of @xmath130 are systematically lower than those from numerical simulation .",
    "this is because the coupling between the actions of players and the dynamics of the system is completely ignored in our stochastic simulation as the actions of the players depend only on the spin variable @xmath104 .",
    "consequently , the global cooperation among the players is suppressed in our semi - analytical calculation .",
    "hence , the wealth distribution of players is less diverse which results in under - estimation of the gini index in the mg .    to make our semi - analytical calculation more `` realistic ''",

    "note that @xmath130 and @xmath135 are calculated using the same algorithm except that the history is updated in a different way . fig .",
    "[ fig : f3 ] shows the gini index @xmath136 versus the control parameter @xmath8 in the mg .",
    "we observe that the values of @xmath135 agree well with the numerical results when @xmath8 is large .",
    "according to crowd - anticrowd theory , if @xmath8 is large , most strategies of the players are uncorrelated to each other due to the under - sampling of the strategy space .",
    "moreover , most of the strategies are used by either one or none of the players in the mg whenever @xmath137 .",
    "therefore , the cooperation between the players can be neglected for @xmath137 .",
    "in addition , the probability of the occurrence of different histories is not the same in the mg when @xmath138  @xcite .",
    "indeed , these two conditions are satisfied in our stochastic simulation using the sequential history .",
    "so , the values of @xmath135 match the numerical estimates when @xmath8 is large .    on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath8 approaches @xmath139 , the values of @xmath135 become larger than the numerical results .",
    "this discrepancy can be explained as follows .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ num_re ] , since there is effective crowd - anticrowd cancellation , the history in the mg becomes more uniform as @xmath8 approaches @xmath139  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , although players still have the same chance to pick anti - correlated pairs separately at the beginning of the game in our sequential simulation , the strategy actually used by each player at each turn is not determined by its virtual score , but a randomly assigned disorder spin variable @xmath112 instead . consequently , two players are less likely to be frozen on an anti - correlated strategy pair .",
    "this makes the crowd - anticrowd cancellation less effective among frozen players in our sequential simulation .",
    "so , the actions among these frozen players may give a strong bias in the output , especially for @xmath37 , where frozen probability is highest .",
    "in turn , the history becomes much more non - uniform .",
    "this greatly increases the gini index as some players have more chance to stay at the winning ( or losing ) side .",
    "finally , we remark that both @xmath130 and @xmath136 calculated by the stochastic simulation are independent of @xmath1 .",
    "this is expected , since the results of the replica calculation do not depend explicitly on @xmath1 .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the inequality of wealth among players in the mg using the well - known measure in economics called the gini index . in particular ,",
    "our numerical findings show that the wealth inequality of players is very severe near the point of maximum global cooperation @xmath140 .",
    "that is to say , in the minority game , global cooperation comes hand in hand with uneven distribution of players wealth . specifically , a significant number of players are forced to use the low ranking strategies and cooperate with those players using the high ranking strategies since the number of strategies at play and the reduced strategy space size are of the same order whenever @xmath141 . in this respect",
    ", we have showed that the crowd - anticrowd theory offers a simple and effective platform to study the wealth inequality in the mg .",
    "in addition , we have studied the gini index semi - analytically by mapping the system of the mg to a spin glass . with this formalism",
    ", we semi - analytically reproduce our numerically simulated gini index in the asymmetric phase of mg by investigating the stationary state properties of mg using the replica trick .",

    "<S> to demonstrate the usefulness of physical approaches for the study of realistic economic systems , we investigate the inequality of players wealth in one of the most extensively studied econophysical models , namely , the minority game ( mg ) . </S>",
    "<S> we gauge the wealth inequality of players in the mg by a well - known measure in economics known as the modified gini index . from our numerical results , we conclude that the wealth inequality in the mg is very severe near the point of maximum cooperation among players , where the diversity of the strategy space is approximately equal to the number of strategies at play . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the optimal cooperation between players comes hand in hand with severe wealth inequality . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that our numerical results in the asymmetric phase of the mg can be reproduced semi - analytically using a replica method . </S>"
