    "much interest is devoted to the physics of a the deconfinement phase of hadronic matter ( quark - gluon plasma , qgp ) , with both strong experimental and theoretical research going on . a good theoretical understanding of this new phase of matter is urgently required , in particular , in order to identify worthwhile observables of this new phase of matter .",
    "insight can be gained in the framework of hot qcd supplemented with a perturbative approach and important progress has been made during the last decade @xcite .",
    "in particular thermal effects are known to alter soft modes in an important way , changing dispersion relations , and allowing for landau damping as well as for new modes of propagation for both fermionic ( quarks ) and bosonic ( gluons ) quasiparticles @xcite .",
    "the collective dynamics involved can be consistently described within hard - thermal - loop ( htl ) resummed perturbation theory @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we are interested in damping of collective gluonic excitations as one of the most important characteristics of the plasma dynamics . while on - shell damping is known to be absent to htl order @xmath2 a non zero damping rate is expected to arise at order @xmath3 . in early work by braaten and",
    "pisarski @xcite a finite , gauge independent result for the damping rate of static transverse gluons @xmath4 has been obtained , as one of the important applications of the htl - resummation scheme .",
    "note that gauge invariance also follows from a general theorem @xcite .",
    "also , in the static regime , @xmath5 has been mentioned in @xcite , as is expected since longitudinal ( l ) and transverse ( t ) degrees of freedom can not be distinguished at zero spatial momentum .",
    "however , a complete understanding of the damping behavior in the plasma is not yet available .",
    "in particular , for non - zero values of the spatial momentum singular results are obtained for transverse and also for longitudinal gluons @xcite , which originate from the absence of a chromo - magnetic mass in the htl resummed gluon propagator . moreover ,",
    "also the analyticity of the damping rates around zero momentum has been questioned recently @xcite : expansion for small @xmath6 of the imaginary part of the gluon polarization tensor has been reported to lead to @xmath7 and even to a quadratic divergence in @xmath8 .    in this letter",
    "we derive a slavnov - taylor ( st ) identity for the gluon polarization tensor in coulomb gauge . after discussing some general consequences of it",
    ", we apply it to the next to leading order contribution to the gluon polarization tensor @xmath9 , which might be helpful in order to further clarify the physics of damping for gluonic modes in the plasma . from it",
    "we easily obtain well known transversality properties as well as new constraints in particular concerning the imaginary part of @xmath9 related to damping .",
    "the expected equality @xmath10 can also be derived .",
    "we report on these findings in the next two sections and further implications are discussed in the conclusions section . for convenience ,",
