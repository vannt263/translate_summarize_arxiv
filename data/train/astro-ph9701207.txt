    "modelling the formation of molecular rotation lines in interstellar clouds is a crucial task both for theoretical and observational astrophysics . on the theoretical side , early studies by goldreich and kwan ( @xcite ) and goldsmith and langer ( @xcite )",
    "have shown that the rotation lines from polar and/or abundant molecules like @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath1 and other hydrides should be the major cooling agents of the molecular gas . together with the heating mechanisms ( e.g. cosmis rays , @xmath11 formation , gravitational contraction and grain heating ) , they control the thermal balance of dense clouds , and thus , the conditions that will allow the contraction toward star formation .",
    "on the observational side , millimeter and submillimeter molecular lines are used to probe several physical parameters of molecular clouds , such as the gas temperature , the @xmath11 density , the abundance of molecules , and the gas dynamics .",
    "densities and temperatures in molecular clouds are such that the collision rate with @xmath11 molecules generally does not allow to reach the thermodynamic equilibrium of the rotation ladder ( see goldreich and kwan @xcite ) . instead , the coupling with the radiation field is important , both via absorption and spontaneous emission .",
    "takahashi et al . ( @xcite and @xcite ) , have shown how far infrared dust photons , @xmath12 to @xmath13 are able to pump the rotation ladder of the @xmath1 molecule within warm molecular cores .",
    "carroll and goldsmith ( @xcite ) have investigated the pumping of molecules via their near infrared ( nir ) vibration transitions . at that time",
    "it was assumed that a significant fraction of the dust emission could be in the nir range , only in the immediate vicinity of hot stars . however , the effect of the nir radiation attributed to large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules ( pahs ) and very small grains , which makes up to 30 % of the total dust emission ( puget et al .",
    "@xcite ) , has never been taken into account .",
    "this radiation is characterised by a strong continuum and broad emission features , located at 6.2 and 7.7 @xmath4 for the strongest ones , wavelengths which concide with the vibration transitions of some molecules .",
    "for instance the @xmath14 transition of @xmath1 and the @xmath15 transition of @xmath2 occur at the maximum of the 6.2 @xmath4 pah feature , and the 7.8 @xmath4 vibration of cs falls within the wavelength range of the 7.7 @xmath4 feature .",
    "there is now clear observational evidence that the nir emission bands are not only present in peculiar reflexion nebulae , but are a general component of the dust radiation : detection of the 3.3 and 6.2 @xmath4 bands in our galaxy by giard et al .",

    "the insert shows the details of the expected nir vibration transitions .",
    "our results show that the net effect of the nir pumping is to slightly reduce the fraction of molecules in the lowest rotation level , increasing the population of the excited levels and thus increasing the intensities of the submillimeter and far infrared lines .",
    "however , the detailed behaviours for @xmath1 and @xmath2 are not the same , because of the different radiative selection rules .      to 6 cm    to 15 cm",
    "@xmath1 is an asymmetric top with a dipole moment of 1.94 debye .",
    "we refer to the rotation levels of @xmath1 using the general @xmath42 numbering of the asymmetric top molecules , where @xmath43 is the total angular momentum and @xmath44 ( respectively @xmath45 ) is the projection of the angular momentum on the symmetry axis for the limiting prolate ( respectively oblate ) molecule ( see townes and shallow @xcite ) .",
    "the selection rules are , @xmath46 and @xmath47 even .",
    "the later rule forbids para / ortho radiative transitions since @xmath48 is odd for ortho and even for @xmath49 .    as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : h2olevels]a , the excitation scheme for @xmath5 is quite complex because of the combination of the radiative pumping by nir photons in the vibrational transitions and fir photons in the rotational transitions .",
    "the molecule is mostly excited by nir pumping in the @xmath50 @xmath51 level and subsequent deexcitation in the @xmath52 rotation level of the vibration ground state ( absorption at 6.18 @xmath4 and emission at 6.64 @xmath4 ) .",
    "the population fraction of the @xmath53 @xmath52 level is considerably increased with respect to the comparison model ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "two different de - excitation channels are possible from this level .",
    "the first one through the 108 @xmath55 line , and the second one through the 180.5 @xmath56 line .",
    "the first channel is not efficient because for the parameters we have selected , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , emission in the 108 @xmath4 line is balanced by radiative pumping by fir dust photons in the same line .",
    "thus , the de - excitation occurs mainly trough the 180.5 @xmath4 line .",
    "the intensity of this line is increased by a factor of order 25 with respect to the collision model .",
    "once in level @xmath59 , the molecule may either be excited in the @xmath60 level by absorption of a 75.4 @xmath4 dust photon , or de - excited in the ground level ( @xmath61 ) by emission at 179.5 @xmath4 .",
    "the population fractions of the j=3 ladder are increased by one to two decades with respect to the collisional model .",
    "consequently , the intensities of the fir and submillimeter de - excitation lines are enhanced by similar factors .",
    "nir pumping at 6.18 @xmath4 has thus a major effect on the @xmath62 ) line at 180.5 @xmath4 , whereas fir pumping at 75.4 @xmath4 mostly enhances the following transitions : @xmath63 ) at 258 @xmath4 , @xmath64 ) at 260 @xmath4 , @xmath65 ) at 273 @xmath4 , and @xmath66 ) at 175 @xmath4 .",
    "the intensity of the 108 @xmath4 line is driven both by nir and fir pumping , and this line can appear in emission or absorption against the dust continuum , depending on the radiation field , the gas density and the molecular column density ( see fig[fig : coldensdiag]b ) .    the case of @xmath49 is quite similar to @xmath5 . the main nir absorption line , ( @xmath67),is located at 6.12 @xmath4 , with re - emissions predicted at 6.39 and 6.67 @xmath4 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : h2olevels]b ) , populating mainly the j=2 rotation ladder .",
    "excitation of the j=3 ladder is much less efficient than in the case the ortho species because the allowed transition has a low einstein coefficient ( @xmath68 against 0.48 for the 75.4 @xmath4 line of @xmath5 ) .",
    "nir and fir pumping are thus responsible for bright de - excitation lines in the j=2 ladder : @xmath69 at 244 @xmath4 , @xmath70 at 399 @xmath4 and @xmath71 at 303 @xmath4 . as for the @xmath5 108 @xmath4 line , the @xmath72 line at 101 @xmath4 will appear either in absorption or emission on the continuum , depending on the physical parameters of the region .    in the regime where the nir pumping line is not saturated ( @xmath73 ) the absorptions at 6.18 and 6.12 @xmath4 give a direct estimate of the ortho and para column densities .",
    "furthermore , fir lines will increase with the pumping rate , i.e. the radiation field .",
    "this later parameter can be fairly well known by direct observation of the dust and pah nir spectrum .",
    "once this is done , the intensities of the fir lines can be used to trace the molecule column densities .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : coldensdiag]a where the calculated iso - intensities of the 180.5 @xmath4 ( @xmath74 ) line are drawn versus the @xmath1 column density and the @xmath11 density .",
    "the dotted contours in the same plot correspond to the comparison model ( collisions only ) . in the comparison model",
    "the line intensity increases fairly regularly with the gas density and the molecule column density .",
    "if radiative pumping is introduced as in our model , it dominates the excitation at moderate densities , @xmath3 , so long as the 6.18 @xmath4 pumping line is optically thin : @xmath75 . in this domain of the parameter space ,",
    "which is appropriate for the conditions that prevail within pdrs , the line intensity is almost independant of the gas density and can be used to trace the column density . however , for the 180.5 @xmath4 line , the intensity is not a linear function of the column density .",
    "this is because the upper and lower levels of the transition have several other radiative exciting or deexciting channels which become optically thick in different column density ranges .",
    "[ fig : coldensdiag]b shows the intensity contours of the ( @xmath76 ) 108 @xmath4 @xmath5 line .",
    "for the sake of clarity we did nt overplot the contours obtained with the comparison model .",
    "they are quite similar to those of the 180.5 @xmath4 line in fig .",
    "[ fig : coldensdiag]a . as mentionned above",
    ", this line appears either in absorption or emission , depending on the gas density , the molecule column density and the radiation field . including nir pumping favors emission in this line since the upper level is directly fed by the de - excitation of the excited vibration state .",
    "this is why the domain where the line will appear in absorption against the dust continuum is restricted to a small region : @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that , in addition to increasing considerably the @xmath1 submillimeter and fir line intensities , radiative pumping will strongly modify the lines intensity ratios with respect to pure collisional models .",
    "for instance , the 180.5 @xmath4 to 179.5 @xmath4 @xmath5 line intensity ratio is increased by a factor of order 10 , and the 398 @xmath4 @xmath49 to 538 @xmath4 @xmath5 submillimeter lines ratio is enhanced by a factor of 60 .",
    "such effects have very important observational consequences , particularly when the lines are used to derive column densities and ortho to para abundance ratios .    finally , the nir lines predicted to appear in absorption and emission against the pah continuum can directly be used to probe the @xmath1 column density .",
    "the line to continuum contrast of the emission transitions is high ( see insert in fig . [",
    "fig : totalspectrum ] ) , because the intensity of these lines comes from energy absorbed at the maximum of the 6.2 @xmath4 pah band . with @xmath5",
    ", we actually have a case of quasi - resonant excitation .",
    "the primary emission transition at 6.64 @xmath4 is thus a good target for observations .",
    "for instance , if we assume a line width of 10 km / s , the measured line to continuum contrast is still of order 50@xmath79 in the 6.64 @xmath4 transition , after dilution by the iso - sws grating spectral resolution ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "this is to be compared to the contrast in the absorption line at 6.18 @xmath4 , @xmath81 for the same resolution .      to 6 cm    to 15",
    "cm    @xmath2 is a symmetric top prolate rotator with a dipole of 1.47 debye .",
    "the possible tunelling of the nitrogen nucleus through the hydrogen plan is responsible for the inversion splitting of the rotation levels with @xmath82 ( levels + and - ) .",
    "we refer to the levels using the usual @xmath83 numbering ( see townes and shallow @xcite ) .",
    "an additional quantum number due to a rotation - vibration interaction , @xmath84 , appears in the case of the degenerate vibration states ( e.g. @xmath85 ) .",
    "the selection rules are those of a symmetric top : @xmath86 ; @xmath87 ; and @xmath88 for transitions which do not involve a degenerate vibration state .",
    "the later rule implies that the different k ladders are not radiatively coupled .",
    "consequently , the lower + and - rotation levels of each k ladder ( j = k ) are the bottom of a radiative cascade , and are almost in thermal equilibrium with the bottom levels of the other ladders .",
    "they are usually refered to as metastable levels .",
    "three vibration states have been included in the excitation calculation of @xmath2 : 0000 , 0100 , and 0001 .",
    "however , despite comparable einstein coefficients , the frequency dependency of the radiative pumping ( see formula [ eq : k_rad ] ) favors radiative pumping in the @xmath89 state ( @xmath90 ) with respect to the 0001 state ( @xmath91 ) . the @xmath89 vibration at @xmath90 correponds to the oscillation of the nitrogen nucleus above ( or bellow ) the hydrogens plan .",
    "the nir pumping induces a pump cycle within each k ladder , with several nir absorption and emission transitions predicted between 9.5 and 12 @xmath4 ( see table [ table : nh3lines ] ) .",
    "the intensities of the fir and submillimeter deexcitation lines are increased by a factor ranging from 2 to 5 : @xmath92 at 125 and 127 @xmath4 , @xmath93 at 170 @xmath4 , @xmath94 at 247 @xmath4 and @xmath95 at 524 @xmath4 for @xmath96 ; @xmath97 , @xmath98 at 166 and 170 @xmath4 and @xmath99 at 247 and 257 @xmath4 concerning @xmath100 .    as for @xmath1 , the effect of nir pumping",
    "is relatively more efficient for the transitions from the higher rotation levels of the downward cascade , because it is more difficult to populate these levels by collisions with the gas .",
    "however , in @xmath2 the metastable levels are thermally populated whatever is their energy .",
    "this facilitates the collisional excitation of high energy levels , if they are not far from the bottom of the k ladder .",
    "for instance , levels ( 4,3)@xmath101 at 165 @xmath41 are only 79 @xmath41 above the ( 3,3)@xmath101 levels from which they can be efficiently populated by collisions .",
    "this explains why nir pumping is relatively less efficient for @xmath2 than @xmath1 .",
    "finally , there is no complex behaviour in the @xmath2 lines as there is in @xmath1 ( e.g. the 108 @xmath4 @xmath5 line ) .",
    "this is because each k ladder is the location of a unique de - excitation cascade , forbidding competition between different channels as in the @xmath1 asymetric rotator .    to 6.5 cm",
    "the main conclusions that can be drawn from our study are the following :      \\2 ) as this mechanism is independent of the gas density , we predict that bright fir and submillimeter rotation lines should be observed from the relatively moderate density and non shocked gas in pdrs , @xmath3 , where molecules are expected to be abundant because of grain mantles evaporation .",
    "\\3 ) for @xmath1 and @xmath2 the intensity of the fir and submillimeter rotation lines can be increased by a factor ranging from 2 to several 100 with respect to models which do not take into account nir pumping .",
    "this means that the molecular column densities that can be infered from observations toward such regions , using standard models , can be wrong by similar factors .",
    "\\4 ) for gas densities below @xmath102 , where nir pumping dominates over collisional excitation , the intensities of the fir lines becomes mostly independant of the gas density .",
    "this implies that the fir and submillimeter lines can be used to probe the molecule column density if the radiation field has been correctly estimated .",
    "\\5 ) for @xmath5 we have a quasi - resonant excitation of the molecule , by absorption of 6.2 @xmath4 pah photons in the 6.18 @xmath4 fundamental vibration transition .",
    "we thus predict a high line to continuum contrast for the emission de - excitation line at 6.64 @xmath4 .",
    "+ nir pumping is likely to affect not only the pdrs , as modelled in this paper , but also the molecular clouds and cores in their vicinity .",
    "the extinction in the 6 to 8 @xmath4 range is minimum ( typically 0.02 of visible extinction , rieke and lebofsky @xcite ) and thus , the radiation produced in the pdr penetrates well in the molecular clouds .",
    "most molecules present in pdrs and nearby molecular clouds will actually be affected by radiative nir pumping .",
    "in addition to @xmath1 and @xmath2 one can list @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 .",
    "the combination of the absorption and emission lines from all species existing in the gas phase is likely to be responsible for the very complex detailed structure of the 5 to 20 @xmath4 spectra measured at moderate spectral resolution in the direction of the m17-sw pdr with the iso - sws intrument ( verstraete et al .",
    "@xcite ) . decrypting such spectra in terms of molecular abundances will require the production of synthetic model spectra including a significant number of molecules of astrophysical interest .",

    "<S> we have developed an excitation model for small molecules including radiative pumping by dust photons from near infrared to submillimeter wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> this model applies to molecules within bright photodissociation regions in galactic star - forming regions and starburst galaxies . in such environments , </S>",
    "<S> the near infrared photons emitted by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules ( pahs ) or small carbon grains , @xmath0 , are able to penetrate molecular regions and pump the molecules in an excited vibration state . </S>",
    "<S> the far infrared and submillimeter transitions involved in the de - excitation cascade are strongly affected by this process . </S>",
    "<S> their intensities can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> we have applied this model to @xmath1 and @xmath2 , ortho and para species . </S>",
    "<S> the behaviour of the fir rotation lines with respect to the gas density and the molecule column density is strongly modified compared to pure collisional models . at moderate densities , @xmath3 , radiative pumping dominates the excitation of the rotation ladder , and the fir lines are good probes of the molecule column density . </S>",
    "<S> the near infrared absorption and emission lines predicted to appear between 6 and 7 @xmath4 for @xmath1 and from 10 to 12 @xmath4 for @xmath2 can also be used for this purpose . </S>",
    "<S> concerning @xmath5 , a quasi resonant pumping of the @xmath6 @xmath7 transition by photons of the 6.2 @xmath4 pah band occurs . </S>",
    "<S> a strong de - excitation emission line is expected at 6.64 @xmath4 .    </S>"
