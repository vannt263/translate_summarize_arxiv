    "at the present day , the intergalactic and interstellar medium ( igm , ism ) are known to be predominantly ionized . however , following recombination at @xmath8 , the baryon content of the universe was mostly neutral . at some point in the history of the universe ,",
    "the igm underwent a transition from this neutral phase to the ionized medium we see today , a period known as the epoch of reionization ( eor hereafter ) .",
    "the strongest constraints on when reionization occurred are set by observations of the gunn - peterson trough of distant quasars , which indicate that by @xmath9 , the universe was mostly ionized ( with neutral fractions @xmath10 ) .",
    "additionally , measurements of the total optical depth of electrons to the surface of last scattering implies that reionization should be occurring at higher redshift , towards @xmath11 , for models of instantaneous reionization @xcite",
    ". however , critical outstanding questions still remain .",
    "firstly , when did the intergalactic hydrogen and helium complete reionization ? and secondly , what were the sources of ionizing photons which powered the reionization process ? was it predominantly powered by star - forming galaxies or by active galactic nuclei / quasars ?    for hydrogen reionization with its earlier completion , the rapid decline in the quasar luminosity function at high redshift @xcite",
    "does suggest that star - forming galaxies are the most likely candidates for completing the bulk of reionization by @xmath12 .",
    "the contribution from faint agn could still however make a significant contribution to the ionizing emissivity at @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "based on the optical depth constraints set by wmap @xcite and either observed igm emissivities at lower redshift @xcite , or emissivities predicted by simulations @xcite , several studies have drawn the same conclusion that faint galaxies from below the current detection limits and/or an increasing ionizing ` efficiency ' at higher redshift is required .",
    "even with the lower optical depth measurement now favoured by the recent planck analysis @xcite , such assumptions are essentially still required to satisfy these criteria @xcite .",
    "one of the possible mechanisms for this increasing ionizing efficiency is an evolution in the fraction of the ionizing photons able to escape their host galaxy and ionize the surrounding igm , known as the escape fraction ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "there have been several studies designed to understand this issue , but there are still large uncertainties in what the escape fraction for galaxies is and how it evolves with redshift and other galaxy properties . in a study of @xmath15 galaxies , @xcite searched for lyman - continuum photons from star forming galaxies , although no systems were detected . after correcting for the lyman - break and igm attenuation the limit placed on the escape fraction is @xmath16 after stacking all sources .",
    "@xcite find an even lower limit of @xmath17 using slitless spectroscopy at @xmath18 , although one agn in their sample is detected .",
    "however , higher escape fractions of @xmath19 to @xmath20 have been measured for galaxies at @xmath21 @xcite , consistent with the relatively high @xmath22 expected from igm recombination rates determined from ly@xmath23 forests @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the average @xmath14 for galaxies at @xmath24 may be significantly higher than the existing measurements due to the selection biases introduced by the lyman - break technique @xcite .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that the property which is fundamental to studies of reionization is the total number of ionizing photons which are available to ionize the intergalactic medium surrounding galaxies .",
    "hence , while the escape fraction is a critical parameter for reionization , it must be measured or constrained in conjunction with the underlying continuum emission to which it applies .",
    "for example , an increase in @xmath14 may not have an effect on reionization if it is accompanied by a reduction in the intrinsic number of ionizing photons being produced .    as shown in @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite  @xcite ) , the number of ionizing photons produced per unit uv luminosity emitted ( e.g. @xmath25 ) can vary significantly as a function of the stellar population parameters such as age , metallicity and dust extinction .",
    "thankfully , evolution or variation among the galaxy population in these parameters will not only influence the production of ionizing photons but will have an effect on other observable properties such as the uv continuum slope ( @xmath3 , @xcite  @xcite ) . with the advent of ultra - deep near - infrared imaging surveys such as the udf12 @xcite and candels @xcite surveys , observations of the uv continuum slope extending deep into the epoch of reionization are now available .",
    "furthermore , there is now strong evidence for an evolution in @xmath3 as a function of both galaxy luminosity and redshift out to @xmath26 @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we use the latest observations of @xmath3 spanning the eor combined with sed modelling , incorporating the physically motivated escape mechanisms to explore what constraints on the key emissivity coefficients are currently available .",
    "we also explore the consequences these constraints may have on the eor for current observations of the star - formation rates in this epoch .",
    "in addition to the observations of in - situ star - formation through the uv luminosity functions , we also investigate whether recent measurements of the galaxy stellar mass function and stellar mass density at high redshift @xcite can provide additional useful constraints on the star - formation rates during eor @xcite .    in section  [ sec : link ]",
    ", we outline the physics and critical parameters required to link the evolution of the neutral hydrogen fraction to the production of ionizing photons .",
    "we also explore plausible physical mechanisms for the escape of lyman continuum photons from galaxies , outlining the models explored throughout the paper .",
    "we then review the current literature constraints on the uv continuum slope , @xmath3 , both as a function of redshift and galaxy luminosity .",
    "next , in section  [ sec : models ] , we explore how the escape fraction , dust extinction and other stellar population parameters affect the observed @xmath3 and the coefficients relating ionizing photon production rates to observed star - formation rates and uv luminosities . in section  [ sec : results ] , we apply these coefficients to a range of existing observations , exploring the predicted ionizing emissivity throughout the epoch of reionization for both constant and redshift dependent conversions .",
    "we then discuss how the varying assumptions and proposed relations would impact the ionizing photon budget consistent with current observations before outlining the future prospects for improving these constraints in section  [ sec : discussion ] . finally , we summarise our findings and conclusions in section  [ sec : summary ] .    throughout this paper ,",
    "all magnitudes are quoted in the ab system @xcite .",
    "we also assume a @xmath27-cdm cosmology with @xmath28 kms@xmath1mpc@xmath1 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "quoted observables ( e.g. luminosity density ) are expressed as actual values assuming this cosmology .",
    "we note that luminosity and luminosity based properties such as stellar masses and star - formation rates scales as @xmath31 , whilst densities scale as @xmath32 .",
    "the currently accepted theoretical picture of the epoch of reionization , as initially described by @xcite , outlines the competing physical processes of ionization of neutral hydrogen by lyman continuum photons and recombination of free electrons and protons .",
    "the transition from a neutral universe to a fully ionized one can be described by the differential equation : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the dimensionless filling factor of ionized hydrogen ( such that @xmath35 for a completely ionized universe ) and @xmath0 is the comoving ionizing photon production rate ( s@xmath1 mpc@xmath2 ) or ionizing emissivity . the comoving density of hydrogen atoms , @xmath36 , and average recombination time @xmath37 are redshift dependent and is dependent on the primordial helium abundance , igm temperature and crucially the inhomogeneity of the igm , parametrised as the so - called clumping factor @xmath38@xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for full details on these parameters and the assumptions associated .    in this paper we will concentrate on @xmath0 and the production of lyman continuum photons by star - forming galaxies .",
    "the link between the observable properties of galaxies and the ionizing photon rate , @xmath0 can be parametrised as @xmath39 following the notation of @xcite ( r13 hereafter ) , where @xmath40 is the observed uv ( 1500 ) luminosity density ( in erg s@xmath1 hz@xmath1 mpc@xmath2 ) , @xmath41 the number of ionizing photons produced per unit uv luminosity ( erg@xmath1 hz ) and @xmath14 the fraction of those photons which escape a host galaxy into the surrounding igm .",
    "alternatively , @xmath0 can be considered in terms of the star - formation rate density , @xmath42 ( m@xmath43 yr@xmath1 mpc@xmath2 ) , @xmath44    where @xmath45 ( s@xmath1 m@xmath46 yr ) is the ionizing photon production - rate per unit star - formation ( @xmath47 in the notation used in @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to observing @xmath40 or @xmath42 during the eor , accurately knowing @xmath14 , @xmath41 and @xmath45 is therefore critical to estimating the total ionizing emissivity independent of how well we are able to measure the uv luminosity or star - formation rate densities .",
    "as the production of @xmath48 photons is dominated by young uv - bright stars , the rate of ionizing photons is therefore highly dependent on the age of the underlying stellar population and the recent star - formation within the galaxy population .",
    "physically motivated values of @xmath41 ( or its equivalent coefficient in other notation ) can be estimated from stellar population models based on plausible assumptions on the properties of high - redshift galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , with observations of the uv continuum slope , @xmath3 @xcite , now extending deep into the epoch of reionization , limited spectral information is now available for a large sample of galaxies . despite the many degeneracies in @xmath3 ( see later discussion in section  [ sec : models ] ) , it is now possible to place some constraints on whether the assumptions made are plausible . in ,",
    "values of @xmath41 are explored for a range of stellar population parameters relative to the @xmath3 observations of @xcite .",
    "based on the range of values consistent with the observed values of @xmath49 , @xcite choose a physically motivated value of @xmath50 .",
    "typically , a constant @xmath14 is applied to all galaxies in addition to the estimated or assumed values of @xmath41/@xmath45 @xcite , motivated in part by our lack of understanding of the redshift or halo mass dependence of @xmath14 . however , applying a constant @xmath14 does not take into account exactly how the lyman continuum photons escape the galaxy , what effect the different escape mechanism might have on the observed galaxy colours , and how that might alter the assumed @xmath41/@xmath45 based on @xmath3 .      in @xcite , detailed ssp and photo - dissociation models were used to explore how future observations of @xmath3 and h@xmath23 equivalent - width with the james webb space telescope ( jwst ) could be used to constrain the escape fraction for two different lyman continuum escape mechanisms ( see fig .",
    "8 of @xcite ) . however , it may already be possible to rule out significant parts of the @xmath14 and dust extinction parameter space using current constraints on @xmath3 and other galaxy properties . to estimate the existing constraints on @xmath14 , @xmath41 , @xmath45 and their respective products , we combine the approaches of @xcite and @xcite . to do this",
    ", we model @xmath3 , @xmath41 and @xmath45 as a function of @xmath14 for the two models of @xcite . the components and geometry of these two models",
    "are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mechanisms ] .         in the first model , model a hereafter ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mechanisms ] left ) and dubbed ` ionization bounded nebula with holes ' by @xcite , lyman continuum photons along with unattenuated starlight are able to escape through low - density holes in the neutral ism . in this model ,",
    "the escape fraction is determined by the total covering fraction of the neutral ism . under the assumption that these holes are small and evenly distributed , the observed galaxy sed ( averaged across the galaxy as in the case of photometry ) would then be a combination of the unattenuated starlight from holes and the dust reddened starlight and nebular emission from the hi enshrouded regions .    a second model , model b hereafter ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mechanisms ] right ) corresponds to the ` density bounded nebula ' of @xcite .",
    "this model could occur when the local supply of hi is exhausted before a complete strmgren sphere can form , allowing lyman continuum photons to escape into the surrounding ism .",
    "the fraction of lyc photons which can escape the nebular region is determined by the fraction of the full strmgren radius at which the nebular region is truncated .",
    "the total escape fraction is then also dependent on the optical depth of the surrounding dust screen .",
    "of these two mechanisms , the former ( model a : ionization bounded nebula with holes ) is the model which most closely represents the physics predicted by full radiation hydrodynamical models of dwarf galaxies .    in @xcite",
    ", it was found that lyman continuum radiation preferentially escaped through channels with low column densities , produced by radiative feedback from massive stars .",
    "the resulting distribution of lyc escape fraction within a galaxy is highly anisotropic and varies significantly between different orientations .",
    "evidence for such an anisotropic escape mechanism has also been found recently by @xcite , who find optically thin ionization cones through which lyc can escape in nearby dwarf starbursts .",
    "similarly , @xcite find a potential high - redshift galaxy analog at @xmath51 with evidence for lyc leakage through holes in the surrounding neutral gas with an escape fraction as high as @xmath52 ( 21% ) .",
    "however , this value represents the optimum case in which there is no dust in or around the low - density channels ( corresponding to model a ) .",
    "for the same system , when @xcite include dust in the low - density channels , the corresponding total lyc escape fraction is reduced to @xmath53 .",
    "the two models explored in this work represent the two extremes of how dust extinction will effect the escaping lyman continuum for toy models such as these , the dust - included estimates of @xcite therefore represent a system which lies somewhere between models a and b.    a potential third mechanism for lyman continuum escape was posited by @xcite , whereby ` runaway ' ob stars which have traveled outside the galaxy centre can contribute a significant amount to the lyc emitted into the surrounding igm . for high - redshift galaxies with significantly smaller",
    "radii than local galaxies , massive stars with large velocities could venture up to 1 kpc away from their initial origin into regions with low column density .",
    "@xcite estimate that these stars could in fact contribute @xmath54 of the escaping ionizing radiation .",
    "in contrast , recent work by @xcite finds that when runaway stars are included into their models of lyman continuum escape , the time average escape fraction only increases by @xmath55 . given the additional complications in modelling the relevant observational properties and their relatively small effect",

    "in several previous studies of the reionization history of the universe the conclusion has been drawn that at earlier times in the epoch of reionization , galaxies must have been more efficient at ionizing the surrounding igm than similar galaxies at lower redshift @xcite .",
    "based on the constraints on galaxy stellar populations and escape fractions explored in section  [ sec : models ] and their application to the existing observations in section  [ sec : results ] , it is not yet possible to establish that one particular galaxy property is evolving to cause such an increase in ionizing efficiency .",
    "however , what we find in this work is that evolution in galaxy properties , such as dust extinction and escape fraction ( or some combination of these and others ) , which are consistent with the observed colour evolution of high - redshift galaxies can readily account for any increase in the ionizing efficiency required by other constraints such as the total optical depth .",
    "ongoing and future observations of both local and distant galaxies will be able to provide much tighter constraints on the evolving galaxy properties .",
    "if the observed @xmath3 evolution is a result of dust alone , as is assumed by @xcite and other works , the inferred evolution in @xmath70 as a function of @xmath3 is highly dependent on the assumed model of lyman continuum escape and hence the underlying geometry of dust and gas .",
    "for example , if the channels through which lyc photons escape are dust - free ( as in model a ) , the effect of the dust evolution will have negligible effect on the emissivity of galaxies as a function of @xmath3 ( as discussed in section  [ sec : beta_effect_stellar_pop ] ) .",
    "real galaxies will of course be significantly more complicated ( and messy ) than the simple toy models adopted in this work , as such the channels through which lyc escape may also contain significant quantities of dust .",
    "we find that if we modify model a such that the dust screen is extended to include the low - density channels , the resulting model is indistinguishable from model b ( density bounded nebula ) with regards to @xmath3 as a function of @xmath14 or @xmath179 .",
    "such a model closely matches that observed by @xcite ( see also @xcite  @xcite ) for a local analog of galaxies during the eor and represents our best model for lyc escape .",
    "for any of the plausible causes for the luminosity and redshift evolution of @xmath3 ( dust , metallicity , escape fraction ) , the models explored in this work infer that fainter / low - mass galaxies are emitting more ionizing photons per unit star - formation into the igm than their higher mass counterparts .",
    "currently , simulations of galaxies at high redshift draw somewhat differing conclusions on the mass / luminosity dependence of the escape fraction .",
    "based on a combination of theoretical models and the existing limited observations , @xcite find that angular averaged escape fraction increases with higher star - formation rates and galaxy masses , the inverse of what we predict based on @xmath3 alone .",
    "however , in isolation from the model predictions , the observational data explored by @xcite does not place any strong constaints on the luminosity dependence of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "subsequent simulations predict the opposite luminosity dependence , in better agreement with the colour evolution predictions of this work @xcite .",
    "recent work exploring the escape fraction of both typical @xcite and dwarf @xcite galaxies at @xmath180 find that the instantaneous escape fraction ( measured at the virial radius in these simulations ) is inversely proportional to the halo mass .",
    "however , as discussed by @xcite , the average instantaneous escape fraction may be somewhat misleading due to the bursty nature of star - formation in their models and the delay between the peak sfr and maximum escape fraction for an episode of star - formation .",
    "they find that the time - averaged escape fraction weighted by the overall lyc photon production rate remains roughly constant for size haloes .",
    "improved measurements on the stellar or halo mass dependence of @xmath14 are therefore clearly crucial .",
    "although direct measurements of the lyc escape fraction for galaxies during eor will never be possible due to the effects of igm absorption along the line of sight , measurements of the escape fraction as a function of stellar mass and luminosity ( or sfr ) at @xmath181 should soon be possible due to the deep uv imaging of new surveys such as the uvudf @xcite and the forthcoming goods uv legacy survey ( pi : oesch , go13872 ) .",
    "the wealth of ancillary data available in these fields ( both photometric and spectroscopic ) should make it possible to tightly constrain @xmath14 , @xmath41 or @xmath45 , and @xmath3 for either individual galaxies or samples stacked by galaxy properties . measuring @xmath3 vs @xmath70 at @xmath182 would significantly reduce systematic errors in the inferred @xmath0 during the eor from incorrect or poorly informed assumptions on @xmath70 .",
    "given the large degeneracies in @xmath3 with respect to the various stellar population parameters , understanding @xmath3 vs @xmath70 both at @xmath24 and during the eor will require an improved understanding of what is responsible for the observed @xmath3 evolution . with alma observations of statistically significant samples of galaxies at high - redshift , it should be possible to make strong constraints on not just the strength and attenuation curve of the dust extinction , but also the location and geometry of the dust relative to the gas and star - formation within galaxies @xcite .    with the new generation of near - infrared sensitive spectrographs allowing precision spectroscopic measurement of metallicities and dust out to @xmath183 ( e.g. mosfire : @xcite ) , it will be possible to place much more accurate priors on the expected ages , metallicities and star - formation histories for galaxies during the eor .",

    "the predicted @xmath0 at @xmath187 remain consistent with measurements based on the igm @xcite .",
    "assuming instead that the ionizing efficiency of galaxies is dependent on their luminosity , the observed @xmath188 relations and our sed models can result in significant changes in the inferred ionizing photon budget .",
    "since our models suggest that redder ( brighter ) galaxies have lower @xmath70 than their blue ( faint ) counterparts , the inferred ionizing photon budget for the currently observable galaxy population may be significantly reduced , especially at lower redshifts . however , because of the increasing importance of faint galaxies ( which have higher inferred @xmath70 ) , only galaxies down to @xmath5 may be required to produce the required ionizing photons .",
    "our conclusion is that the inferred ability of galaxies to complete or maintain reionization is highly dependent on the stellar population assumptions used to predict their ionizing efficiencies .",
