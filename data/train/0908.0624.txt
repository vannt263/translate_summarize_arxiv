    "@xcite bismuth telluride and its solid solutions ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) are among the best known thermoelectric materials for the modern commercial application .",
    "these materials possess notable properties such as high anisotropic multivalley fermi surface , small value of the thermal conductivity , and optimal value of the carrier concentration at room temperature ( rt ) . since the electron dimensional confinement and the phonon boundary scattering control the electron and phonon transport , bismuth telluride based superlattices and quantum wires have improved thermoelectric properties as compared to bulk bismuth telluride material .",
    "for example , the thermoelectric figure of merit ( @xmath2 ) of the @xmath5 superlattices was reported to have the value of 2.4 while the maximum @xmath2 for the bulk bismuth telluride material is less than 1 at room temperature .",
    "@xcite due to stronger spatial confinement the bismuth telluride nanowires ( nw ) are expected to be better than the quantum well superlattices .",

    "@xcite using the technique based on translating thin film growth thickness control into planar wire arrays , metallic and semiconductor nanowires with diameters and pitches ( center - to - center distances ) as small as 8 and 16 nm , respectively , were prepared .",
    "@xcite    electric field effect ( efe ) is a powerful tool controlling the electrical properties of low dimensional structures .",
    "the latest experimental and theoretical studies showed that the efe , as well as thermal annealing , can significantly improve the thermoelectric properties of bi , pbse nanowires and pbte films . @xcite",
    "while dimensional confinement of electrons leads to the modification of their density of states , the fermi level can be changed due to efe control of the electron ( hole ) concentration in nw . in nanowires ,",
    "efe on the thermoelectric properties can also be related to the energy spectrum modification and local properties of the electron distribution function .",
    "in addition , the applied electric field can cause quantum confinement of carriers .",
    "for these reasons , the electric field applied through the side gates camn lead to strong modifications the thermoelectric properties of the nanowires .",
    "the analysis of the temperature dependent thermoelectric power provides a reliable way for estimating the majority carrier concentration in nanowires even when the conventional hall - effect can not be used .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we theoretically studied the intrinsic and doped bismuth telluride nanowires grown along [ 110 ] direction at rt .",
    "the studied nws have the square cross- sections of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the main objective of this manuscript is to examine a feasibility of a drastic @xmath2 enhancement in nanowires via application of the perpendicular electrical field .",
    "specifically , we studied how the change in the electron density of states caused by both the size quantization and electric field influences the thermoelectric properties of nws .",
    "we examined conditions at which the size quantization effects compete with the electric field effect and when both effects cooperate in improving the thermoelectric properties of nws .",
    "the electron mobility in the nws is assumed to coincide with the electron mobility in the bismuth telluride bulk material . in our calculations",
    ", we used the values of the lattice thermal conductivity , electron ( hole ) mobility , and carrier effective mass components obtained previously for the bismuth telluride nws with the growth direction of [ 110 ] .",
    "@xcite the transport parameters were estimated using the semi - classical boltzman approximation .",
    "we used the constant - relaxation - time approximation to calculate the seebeck coefficient , electrical and thermal conductivities .",
    "the application of this approach to the calculation of the transport properties of bismuth telluride nw material has been justified by us elsewhere .",
    "@xcite in this paper , we also used some of the notations introduced in our previous work .",
    "@xcite the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : level2 ] , we describe our approach for solving the self - consistent system of the schrdinger and poisson equations . in section  [ sec : level3 ] , the dependence of the thermoelectric parameters of bismuth telluride nws on lateral gate voltage is studied . in section  [ sec : level4 ] , we consider the local variation of the thermoelectric parameters inside nws . in section  [ sec : level5 ] , we discuss the temperature dependence of the thermoelectric parameters . finally , our conclusions are given in section  [ sec : level6 ] .",

    "the rydberg constant is @xmath39 ev ( @xmath40 ev ) which is nearly 2 orders of magnitude less than the rydberg constant for hydrogen @xmath41 ev .",
    "since the dielectric constant of bismuth telluride material is high , the rydberg constant has a rather small value of about 15 mev compared to the band gap of 480 mev for the nw with a thickness of 7 nm and the excess hole concentration @xmath42 .",
    "the influence of the electron - electron exchange - correlation processes on the higher - temperature performance of the wires is largely irrelevant , as the values of @xmath43 do not exceed 20 mev , which corresponds to about 230 k. for the intrinsic semiconductor nanowires with a small electron ( hole ) concentration , we did not take into consideration the local exchange - correlation energy , since the exchange - correlation effects can be neglected in semiconductor heterostructures with the doping concentration of about @xmath44 ( ref . ) .",

    "the subband energies seem to shift with temperature because the fermi level is chosen as an origin in the band diagram .",
    "actually , the nw fermi level does shift with temperature .",
    "the shift of the fermi level is mainly due to the change in the ratio between the numbers of carriers with opposite polarity with temperature . at a low temperature ,",

    "the splitting between the first and second subbands is much greater than the splitting between the second and third subbands . for the 7-nm - thick intrinsic nw , the splitting between the second and the third electron subbands increases from a value of 14 to 39 mev with temperature , while the corresponding hole subbands remain very close to each other . for the 7-nm - thick ( 15-nm - thick ) @xmath1type nw at the gate voltage of 60 v ( 45 v ) , the splitting between the second and third electron subbands of 57 mev ( 18 mev ) is about 5 ( 3 ) times greater than the splitting between the corresponding hole subbands of 12 mev ( 6 mev ) .",
    "this effect is due to the difference between the electron and hole masses .",
    "we recall that , for the nanowires , the electron density of states have peculiarities at the edge of energy subbands , which leads to the increase in both the carrier concentration and the seebeck coefficient as well as the decrease in the thermal conductivity .",
