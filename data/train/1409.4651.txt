    "the equations of motion for steady - state spherical symmetric flow of matter into or out of a condensed object ( e.g. neutron stars , ` black holes ' , etc . ) are discussed by michel @xcite and also obtained analytic relativistic accretion solution onto the static schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the accretion of phantom energy onto a static schwarzschild black hole was first proposed by babichev et al @xcite and established that black hole mass will gradually decrease due to strong negative pressure of phantom energy and finally all the masses tend to zero near the big rip where it will disappear .",
    "jamil @xcite has investigated the accretion of phantom like variable modified chaplygin gas onto schwarzschild black hole and also showed that mass of the black hole will decreases for dark energy accretion and otherwise will increases .",

    "<S> these models generate both quintessence and phantom scenarios i.e. , phantom crossing models . </S>",
    "<S> so if these dark energies accrete onto the btz bh , then in quintessence stage , bh mass increases upto a certain value ( finite value ) and then decreases to a certain finite value for phantom stage during whole evolution of the universe . </S>",
