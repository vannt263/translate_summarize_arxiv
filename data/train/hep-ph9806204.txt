    "since the first observation of the @xmath1 enhancement more than 40 years ago @xcite , there have been many attempts to find dynamical mechanisms responsible for it , in particular within the standard model .",
    "this @xmath3 rule was particularly enigmatic before the birth of qcd when only the current - current operator @xmath4 arising from the w exchange was considered and , consequently , the ratio @xmath5@xmath6@xmath7 was expected to be about one order of magnitude smaller than the experimentally observed value @xmath8 .",
    "now , since the establishment of qcd , our understanding of this rule has improved considerably . within qcd , the @xmath0 amplitudes are obtained from the effective hamiltonian for @xmath9 transitions @xcite , @xmath10 involving the wilson coefficients @xmath11 which can be calculated for a scale @xmath12 gev using perturbative renormalization group techniques , as well as , the local four - quark operators @xmath13 .",
    "the hadronic matrix elements of these operators are difficult to calculate but can be estimated using non - perturbative techniques generally for @xmath14 around a scale of @xmath15 gev . for the @xmath1 rule only the @xmath16 part of the wilson coefficient @xmath17",
    "is numerically relevant , with @xmath18 .",
    "the dominant operators are @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "major improvements were obtained when it was observed that the qcd ( and electroweakly ) induced effective hamiltonian of eq.([heff ] ) can explain various large enhancements .",
    "these can be of short - distance ( sd ) nature , like the first identified _ octet enhancement _",
    "@xcite in the @xmath21-@xmath4 sector dominated by the increase of @xmath22 when @xmath14 evolves from @xmath23 down to @xmath24 gev .",
    "another important sd enhancement was found to arise in the sector of the qcd penguin operators , in particular for @xmath25 , through the proper inclusion of the treshold effects ( and the associated incomplete gim cancellation ) @xcite .",
    "enhancements are also of long - distance ( ld ) nature like the first identified ld enhancement of the matrix elements of the qcd penguin operators over the matrix elements of @xmath21 and @xmath4 . the latter was first conjectured and estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite using the vacuum insertion method . due to the non - perturbative character of the ld contribution",
    ", a large variety of techniques has been proposed to estimate it ( for some recent publications see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . among the analytical methods ,",
    "the @xmath2 approach @xcite associated with the chiral effective lagrangian is particularly interesting . in this approach",
    ", an additional ld enhancement is obtained from inclusion of chiral loop effects in the @xmath21-@xmath4 sector .",
    "the net result of all enhancements mentioned above is a value of @xmath26 in the range of @xmath27-@xmath28 @xcite of the measured value @xmath29 , suggesting that the bulk of the @xmath1 rule in @xmath30 decays is now understood .",
    "channel is usually obtained `` sufficiently suppressed '' whereas the @xmath1 enhancement is obtained only partially . in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath31 gev@xmath32 mev and @xmath33 mev the latter channel was reproduced to @xmath34 . ]",
    "one might note that the agreement with experiment is not improved by inclusion of the nlo renormalization group equations for the @xmath16 s @xcite .    in this proceeding ,",
    "we reconsider the calculation of @xmath0 amplitudes relevant for the @xmath1 rule in the @xmath2 approach of ref .  @xcite .",
    "our main improvement consists in the fact that we use a modified matching procedure in order to remove previous ambiguities .",
    "this will be done treating the factorizable ( f ) and non - factorizable ( nf ) contributions differently .",
    "only the nf diagrams are matched with the sd contributions to cancel the scale dependence of the sd wilson coefficients ( after having , as we will see , factorized out the scale dependence of the coefficient @xmath35 in the matrix elements of the operator @xmath36 ) .",
    "factorizable loop contributions which refer uniquely to the strong sector of the theory can be calculated in full chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath37pt ) , the corresponding scale dependence being absorbed in the renormalization of the various parameters in the lagrangian . as a result of this procedure , performing a matching with the sd wilson coefficients , we obtain an additional enhancement of the @xmath38 channel which we find to be in good agreement with experiment . the @xmath39 channel , however , exhibits a large dependence on the matching scale , resulting from the difference of two large numbers , but is found to be equal or smaller than the experimental value in such a way that the ratio @xmath29 is reproduced or even passed beyond .",
    "to calculate the matrix elements , we start from the chiral effective lagrangian for pseudoscalar mesons which involves an expansion in momenta where terms up to @xmath40 are included @xcite , @xmath41 with @xmath42 denoting the trace of @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 and @xmath46 are free parameters related to the pion decay constant @xmath47 ( @xmath48 mev ) and to the quark condensate , respectively , with @xmath49 . up to terms of @xmath40 and to",
    "leading order in the @xmath2 expansion , the lagrangian of eq.([leff ] ) has the most general structure relevant for the operators @xmath21 , @xmath4 and @xmath36 .",
    "the degrees of freedom of the complex matrix @xmath50 are identified with the pseudoscalar meson nonet given in a non - linear representation : @xmath51 where , in terms of the physical states , @xmath52 \\sqrt2 \\pi^- & \\textstyle -\\pi^0+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}a\\eta+\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}b\\eta ' & \\sqrt2 k^0 \\\\[2 mm ] \\sqrt2 k^- & \\sqrt2 \\bar{k}^0 &   \\textstyle -\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}b\\eta+\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}a\\eta ' \\end{array } \\right)\\,,\\hspace{3mm}\\ ] ] with @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath55 is the @xmath56 mixing angle satisfying the relation @xcite @xmath57^{-1}\\,,\\ ] ] which yields @xmath58 .",
    "note that we treat the singlet as a dynamical degree of freedom .",
    "consequently , in eq.([leff ] ) we include the strong anomaly term , with the instanton parameter @xmath59 ( @xmath60 @xmath61 ) , which gives a non - vanishing mass of the @xmath62 in the chiral limit ( @xmath63 ) reflecting the explicit breaking of the axial @xmath64 symmetry .",
    "the lagrangian of eq.([leff ] ) is equivalent to the one of ref .",
    "@xcite ( provided we identify the coefficient @xmath65 of ref .",
    "@xcite with @xmath66 ) , except for the fact that we explicitly include the @xmath62 .    a straightforward bosonization yields the chiral representation of the quark currents and densities @xmath67 ( d_l)_{ij}&=&(d_r^\\dagger)_{ij}= \\bar{q}_{ir } q_{jl }   = -r\\big(\\frac{f^2}{4}u^\\dagger+l_5\\partial_\\mu u^\\dagger \\partial^\\mu u u^\\dagger   \\big)_{ji}\\;. \\label{cd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using eqs .",
    "( [ cj])-([cd ] ) , the operators @xmath21 , @xmath4 and @xmath36 can be expressed in terms of the meson fields .",
    "the @xmath2 corrections to the matrix elements @xmath68 are calculated by chiral loop diagrams .",
    "the loop expansion involves a series in @xmath69 which is in direct correspondence with the short - distance expansion in terms of @xmath70 . in these diagrams we encounter integrals which are regularized by a finite cutoff as it was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . due to the truncation to pseudoscalar mesons",
    ", the cutoff has to be taken at or , preferably , below the @xmath71(1gev ) .",
    "this restriction is a common feature of the phenomenological approaches at hand in which higher resonances are not included .    to retain the physical amplitudes @xmath72 , which as a matter of principle are scale - independent , the long- _ and _ the short - distance contributions are evaluated at the cutoff scale , i.e.",
    ", the ld ultraviolet scale is identified with the sd infrared one . performing this identification we must take into account that , within the cutoff regularization , there is a dependence on the way we define the momentum variable inside the loop .    in the standard approach of refs .",
    "@xcite , the cutoff is associated to the virtual meson , i.e. , the integration variable is identified with the meson momentum .",
    "consequently , as there is no corresponding quantity in the short - distance part , a rigorous matching of long- and short - distance contributions is not possible .",
    "the ambiguity is removed by associating the cutoff to the effective color singlet gauge boson as introduced within a study of the @xmath73@xmath74 mass difference @xcite .",
    "this is done by identifying in the ld , as well as in the sd part , the momentum variable in the loop integration with the momentum flow between the two currents or densities . with respect to the standard approach",
    ", the momentum of the virtual meson is shifted by the external momentum , the former being no longer identical with the integration variable , which affects both the ultraviolet , as well as the infrared structure of the @xmath2 corrections .",
    "note that the matching prescription advocated in ref .",
    "@xcite was also used for current - current operators in the chiral limit in ref .",
    "the authors showed that the coefficient of the quadratic term in the cutoff is increased by a factor 3/2 relative to the one obtained from the standard matching prescription @xcite .",
    "this provides an additional _ octet enhancement _ which , however , has to be confirmed by a full calculation of the amplitudes relevant for the @xmath1 rule .",
    "as we will argue , from this calculation we performed , we confirm this enhancement which is even largely increased by the effects beyond the chiral limit .    obviously , the modified procedure described above is applicable to the non - factorizable part of the interaction and not to the factorizable ones .",
    "the factorizable part , however , refers to the strong sector of the theory , and has not to be matched with any sd contribution .",
    "consequently , it can be calculated in pure @xmath37pt . in this case",
    "dimensional regularization can ( and will ) be used .",
    "therefore , no momentum prescription ambiguities appear .",
    "this separation of f and nf contributions was already applied in a similar way to investigate the @xmath75 parameter @xcite .",
    "expanding the lagrangian of eq.([leff ] ) , as well as , the currents and densities of eqs.([cj])-([cd ] ) in terms of pseudoscalars fields , the various f and nf one - loop diagrams to be calculated are given in fig .  1 and fig .  2 respectively .",
    "+     +   + fig .  1 .",
    "factorizable diagrams contributing to the matrix elements of the operators @xmath76 .",
    "crossed circles represent the currents or densities ( with indices ( dq ) ( qs ) here specified for @xmath36 ) ; black circles denote strong vertices .",
    "the lines represent the pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "+ in addition to these diagrams the effect of the wave function renormalization must be included , and the values of the various parameters in the lagrangian must be expressed in terms of physical quantities .",
    "this we did in pure @xmath37pt following our general procedure for the factorizable contributions .",
    "we checked that the scale dependence coming from the factorizable diagrams is completely canceled by the scale dependence of the various parameters in the tree level expression of the matrix elements .",
    "explicitly , we obtain the following expressions : @xmath77 with @xmath78 and @xmath79 defined by the relation @xmath80 for the reason of brevity , in eqs.([fact1])-([fact3 ] ) we omit scale - independent ( finite ) terms resulting from the one - loop corrections which , nevertheless , are taken into account within the numerical analysis .",
    "+        note that in the definition of @xmath79 , in the denominator on the left - hand side of eq.([l5r ] ) , we used @xmath47 rather than f. formally , the difference represents higher order effects .",
    "nevertheless , the appearance of @xmath45 in eq.([l5r ] ) would induce residual scale dependence in eqs.([fact1])-([fact3 ] ) which has no counterpart at the sd level .",
    "therefore , the choice of @xmath47 is more adequate as it ensures that no scale dependence appears in the complete factorizable ld contribution of the matrix elements except the scale dependence of @xmath81 . to be explicit ,",
    "in accordance with current conservation , there is no scale dependence in eqs.([fact1])-([fact2 ] ) ; as to the density - density operator of eq.([fact3 ] ) , we are just left with the scale dependence of @xmath35 .",
    "this is to be expected since the evolution of @xmath81 is just inverse to the evolution of a single density operator .",
    "consequently , the scale dependence of eq.([fact3 ] ) ( which is of leading order in @xmath82 ) exactly cancels the corresponding diagonal evolution of @xmath25 at sd .",

    "@xcite .    note that in the denominators of eqs.([nfact1])-([nfact6 ] ) we took the physical value @xmath47 rather than @xmath45 , in the same way as for the factorizable diagrams .",
    "again , the difference represents higher order effects . however , the scale dependence of @xmath45 in eqs.([nfact1])-([nfact6 ] ) has no counterpart in the sd and will be absorbed at the next order of the chiral expansion .",
    "note also that in ref .",
    "@xcite only the tree level contribution was taken into account in the matrix elements of @xmath36 .",
    "the latter are proportional to the @xmath85 coefficient , as the tree level contribution of the @xmath86 coming from @xmath87 vanishes due to the unitarity of @xmath50 . from the point of the @xmath82 counting it",
    "is justified to consider only the tree level contribution for @xmath36 , since the @xmath25 coefficient is @xmath88 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , only the one - loop diagrams induced by the operators @xmath21 and @xmath4 were considered .",
    "loops over @xmath36 from @xmath87 , on the other hand , were assumed to be zero as the corresponding tree level contribution from @xmath87 is zero .",
    "however , an explicit calculation of the nf one - loop contributions to the matrix elements of @xmath36 coming from @xmath87 yields a non - trivial cutoff dependence , as shown in eqs.([nfact5 ] ) and ( [ nfact6 ] ) , which has to be matched with the sd part . this effect can not be neglected since it corresponds to the leading non - vanishing order of the twofold series expansion in @xmath2 and @xmath89 ; i.e. , it is of the same order as the tree level term proportional to @xmath85 ( the former , being of @xmath90 , is the leading term in the @xmath89 expansion , while the latter , being of order @xmath91 , is leading in the @xmath2 expansion ) .",
    "the resulting scale dependence , however , is only of minor importance within the analysis of the @xmath1 rule .. further details on this new calculation of the matrix elements of @xmath36 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . ]    our numerical result for the amplitude re@xmath92 is shown in fig .",
    "3 . it shows an additional enhancement which renders the amplitude in good agreement with the observed value .",
    "the new contribution arises from the @xmath21 and @xmath4 operators .",
    "it is due to the modified matching prescription in the nf sector ( except for approximately one fifth of it which is due to the choice of the physical value @xmath47 in eqs.([nfact1])-([nfact6 ] ) as explained above ) .",
    "our result is remarkably stable with respect to the matching scale .",
    "the main uncertainty displayed in fig .",
    "3 originates from the dependence of the wilson coefficients on @xmath93 @xmath94 . on the other hand , the isospin @xmath95 amplitude shown in fig .",
    "4 is highly unstable .",
    "the large uncertainty can be understood from the fact that it is obtained from the difference of two large amplitudes of approximately the same size [ namely @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "consequently , the @xmath95 amplitude is not well reproduced except that , and this is a crucial point , it comes out to be sufficiently suppressed whatever the particular chosen scale is between @xmath98 mev and @xmath15 gev .",

    "re@xmath102 in units of @xmath100 mev for @xmath31 gev@xmath101 mev .",
    "the experimental value is represented by the dashed line .",
    "+ in conclusion , it is certainly premature to say that the @xmath1 rule for @xmath0 decays is now understood completely since the @xmath2 approach we use is only an approximate method . in particular , vector mesons and higher resonances should be included in order to take a higher and more secure value for the matching scale .",
    "( it is probable that the vector mesons play an important role for @xmath102 ) .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that the enhancement reported here is a further important indication that the @xmath2 approach can account for the bulk of the @xmath1 rule for @xmath0 decays .",
