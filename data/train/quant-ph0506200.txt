    "a quantum computer has been expected to outperform its classical counterpart in some computation problems .",

    "numerical calculations confirm these results .",
    "the fig.(1b ) and fig.(2 ) in @xcite are two examples on how to apply the above rule on complicated circuits .",
    "complicated gsqc circuit may have exponentially small energy gap , like the circuit in fig.(1b ) of @xcite , and assembling the gsqc circuit directly following the algorithm for the standard paradigm , such as quantum fourier transform , leads to exponentially small energy gap . in order to avoid such small gap ,",
    "the teleportation boxes are introduced on each qubit between two control hamiltonians@xcite .",
    "fig.([teleport ] ) shows how the cnot interacting qubits is modified by inserting teleportation boxes on each qubit s upstream and downstream part .",
    "the teleportation boxes make all qubits short ( the longest qubit has length 8) , on the other hand , for arbitrary gsqc circuit they make the energy gap only polynomially small @xmath63@xcite if all boost and projection hamiltonians have the same amplifying factor @xmath27 .",
    "to determine magnitude of @xmath27 , one only needs to count the total number of qubits in the circuit , say @xmath64 , which is proportional to the number of control operation in an algorithm , then the probability of finding all electrons on final rows is @xmath65 with @xmath66 being 8 , the maximum length of qubit . in order to have appreciable @xmath67 , we set @xmath68 , hence @xmath69 . the details can be found in @xcite .      in the previous section",
    "the rule for finding scale of the energy gap is under the assumption that when a projection hamiltonian @xmath19 is applied , @xmath70 is appreciable for the ground state on row just before the projection hamiltonian : a|+b| , [ ab ] where @xmath71 ( @xmath14 ) and @xmath72 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the ground - state wavefunction concentrates on the last row , hence the first excited state wavefunction can not have appreciable weight there because otherwise @xmath73 . when evaluate @xmath45 on a qubit",
    ", the projection hamiltonian on the qubit itself does nt contribute to @xmath45 .",
    "for example , concerning a single qubit , as shown in fig.([projection ] ) , with only identical transformations @xmath74 and ended by @xmath75 , if @xmath40 so that @xmath12 on the first row is @xmath76 , then the energy gap @xmath15 is almost independent of @xmath27 , as shown in the top line of fig.([projen ] ) .",
    "however , if in eq.([ab ] ) @xmath77 , then @xmath15 depends on @xmath27 until @xmath27 reaching @xmath78 .",
    "this is because when @xmath79 , the ground - state wavefunction has little weight on the last row , and",
    "the first excited state concentrates there , hence @xmath45 is small , leading to small energy gap .",
    "when @xmath80 , ground state wavefunction has large part on the last row , then just like the above situation , energy gap is not further affected by increasing @xmath27 .    to confirm the above analysis",
    ", we numerically calculate the energy gap of a 6-row single qubit ended with projection hamiltonian , as shown in fig.([projection ] ) .",
    "the boundary hamiltonian is @xmath81 , all other hamiltonians except for that at final row are @xmath82 with @xmath83 , and on the final row there is a projection hamiltonian @xmath75 . by tuning @xmath29 , we can determine what fraction of wavefunction is projected from the 5th row to the last row . at @xmath84 ,",
    "on the 5th row the ground state wavefunctions are @xmath85 with @xmath86 fig.([projen ] ) shows that the energy gap is @xmath87 as @xmath88 , and when @xmath89 , @xmath15 becomes independent on @xmath27 .",
    "the independent @xmath15 is proportional to @xmath90 .    in order to make the ground - state wavefunction concentrate on the last row",
    "so that measurement corresponds to the desired state , @xmath27 must be larger than @xmath91 , thus the energy gap is determined by the fraction of state been projected .",
    "if @xmath92 is exponentially small , which may happen in certain case , then the energy gap is exponentially small .",
    "fortunately , this does nt happen to the gsqc implement of quantum fourier transform , there all projection hamiltonians are applied to teleportation circuit , and @xmath93 .",
    "however , it plays a role in the algorithm presented in the following section .    for multiple interacting qubits , if @xmath94 in eq.([ab ] ) , the rule of finding energy gap needs modification : with all qubits ended with either a projection or a boost hamiltonian containing the same amplifying factor @xmath46 , when estimating @xmath45 for any qubit , say qubit @xmath47 , ( @xmath10 ) at first @xmath48 is set to 1 ; ( @xmath49 ) the boost hamiltonian , @xmath95 the @xmath51 hamiltonian , on qubit @xmath47 itself increases @xmath48 by multiplication of @xmath27 or min@xmath96 ; ( @xmath52 ) if qubit @xmath47 directly interacts with another qubit , say qubit @xmath53 by hamiltonian @xmath54 , then we determine , excluding qubit @xmath47 , on the qubit @xmath53 the amplitude ratio of the upstream part ( divided by @xmath54 ) over its final row , @xmath97 , and contribution to @xmath97 from other qubits are found one by one according to eq.([wavefunction ] ) : if the upstream part of qubit @xmath53 does nt coexist with the states on final rows of a qubit , except for qubit @xmath47 , then @xmath56 should be multiplied by @xmath27 ( ended with boost hamiltonian ) or @xmath98 ( ended with projection hamiltonian ) ; ( @xmath57 ) finally , the value of @xmath45 on qubit @xmath47 should be multiplied by @xmath97 or @xmath99 if more than one qubit directly interact with qubit @xmath47 .",
    "it is easy to find that when @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath46 , we get the same result as the previous subsection .",
    "after @xmath45 s on all qubits being evaluated , the minimum @xmath45 gives the energy gap scale as ( 1/x)_min^2 .",
    "there are some interesting properties for the gsqc .",
    "although it was shown@xcite that , concerning on time cost , a quantum computer composed of ( time varying ) local hamiltonians is equivalent to standard circuit quantum computer , gsqc provides some insights to design quantum algorithm for certain problems .",
    "for example , the projection hamiltonian , which corresponds to measurement in standard paradigm , can amplify the probability at a particular state .",
    "here we are not claiming that the gsqc is more powerful than standard quantum computer , however , the gsqc does provide a direct approach for certain problem , as shown below is the algorithm for the sat problems .",
    "at first we give the simplest example , considering that qubit @xmath10 @xmath102 controls an ancilla qubit that is at the right side in fig.([two ] ) , and their boundary hamiltonians make the ground state on their first rows are @xmath76 and @xmath13 , respectively . on last rows the ground state",
    "is @xmath103 .",
    "if we apply a boost hamiltonian on qubit @xmath10 and a projection hamiltonian @xmath75 on the ancilla qubit , then at the ground state the state on final rows becomes @xmath104 .",
    "the large value of @xmath27 makes sure that there is large probability to find two electrons on the final rows of the two qubits at the ground state .",
    "so by choosing projected state on the ancilla qubit , we can have the selected state @xmath13 on qubit @xmath10 , and prevent the other state @xmath14 from reaching its final row .",
    "if qubit @xmath10 entangles with other qubit , such as @xmath105 , the entanglement of @xmath106 will not be affected .",
    "thus we call circuit in fig.([two ] ) a filter for the clause @xmath107 .",
    "another example makes more sense .",
    "lets consider a sat problem with clauses , each of which involves two qubits , say qubit @xmath10 and @xmath23 , and requires @xmath108 .",
    "we can implement this clause by the gsqc circuit in fig.([antiferro ] ) . in this figure",
    "there are three qubits : qubit @xmath10 , qubit @xmath23 and an ancilla qubit that is at the left side in the figure .",
    "it s easy to find that if on the first row @xmath109 and the ancilla qubits at @xmath13 , then at the ground state on the final rows of the three qubits the state is @xmath110 , which satisfies the clause .",
    "thus circuit in fig.([antiferro ] ) filters out states not satisfying this simple clause and lets through those satisfying states .",
    "it is important to note that at the beginning if the satisfying states entangle with other qubits not showing in the figure , these entanglements keep untouched .",
    "the property of gsqc brings up new quantum algorithm naturally .",
    "here we present one to solve the sat problems as shown in fig.([circuit ] ) , a gsqc circuit to solve a 3-sat problem with only 9 bits .",
    "it s easy to be extended to @xmath0-bit @xmath1-sat problems .",
    "each clause is implemented by a  filter box \" , and the circuit inside each filter box makes sure that on rows immediately below it the ground state satisfies the clause @xmath3 , or we can say those unsatisfying states are filtered out .",
    "this can be realized by projection and boost hamiltonians like in fig.([two ] ) and fig.([antiferro ] ) .    in fig.([circuit ] ) , the initial state on the top rows of qubit from 1 to 9 is @xmath111 , which is enforced by the boundary hamiltonians , @xmath40 ; the clause involving qubit 1 , 2 and 3 is implemented by filter box 1 , the clause involving qubit 2 , 3 and 4 implemented by filter box 4 , the clause involving qubit 3 , 4 and 8 implemented by filter box 6 , etc .",
    "[ circuit ]    when all constraints are implemented , at ground state the states measured on the final rows of the @xmath0 qubits should be superposition of all states satisfying all constraints . no backtracking is needed .",
    "concerning energy gap , unlike the circuit for quantum fourier transform , in which the energy gap is determined by the number of control operation@xcite , the sat problems is more complicated to evaluate because it might involve the situation to project a very small fraction of state as shown in section [ fraction ] .",
    "for example , if one constructs a gsqc for the grover s search problem with one condition to find a unique satisfying state from @xmath112 states , then he will find that there is an ancilla qubit containing such unnormalized state    @xmath75 . in order to amplify the amplitude of the correct state on the final row",
    ", it requires @xmath113 .",
    "its energy gap is hence less than @xmath114 , which is consistent with the limit set by many other works@xcite .",
    "up to now the filters , fig.([two ] ) and fig.([antiferro ] ) , we have given are trivial , and now we give an example on how to implement a filter for a serious problem .",
    "we focus on the 3-bit exact cover problem@xcite , an instance of sat problem , which belongs to np - complete .",
    "following is the definition of the 3-bit exact cover problem :    _ there are @xmath0 bits @xmath115 , each taking the value 0 or 1 . with @xmath116 clauses applied to them ,",
    "each clause is a constraint involving three bits : one bit has value 1 while the other two have value 0 .",
    "the task is to determine the @xmath0-bit state satisfying all the clauses . _      the algorithm is implemented by the circuit in fig.([circuit ] ) .",
    "each filter box , in our algorithm , involves three qubits , say qubit @xmath117 and @xmath118 , which are represented by gray dot columns in fig.([filterbox ] ) .",
    "we add two ancilla qubits : qubit 1 and qubit 2 , which are represented by dark dot columns .",
    "qubit @xmath117 and @xmath119 at the first row are in the state @xmath120 if they have not experienced any clause yet , and the two ancilla qubits are in the states @xmath121 and @xmath122 on top rows by selecting proper boundary hamiltonians , where @xmath123 corresponds to the state of ancilla qubit 1 , and @xmath124 to the state of ancilla qubit 2 .    inside the dashed triangle of fig.([filterbox ] ) , after the first @xmath102 , we obtain state @xmath125 ; after the second @xmath102 : @xmath126 ; after the third @xmath102 : & & |(|1|0|0+|0|1|0+|0|0|1+|1|1|1 ) + & + & |(|1|1|0+|0|1|1+|1|0|1+|0|0|0).immediately below the triangle , if the system stays at the ground state , if electron in ancilla qubit 1 is measured to be on the row labeled by @xmath127 and at state @xmath128 , and if the three electrons on qubit @xmath129 are all found on the rows labeled by @xmath127 , then the three - qubit state satisfies the clause except for @xmath130 .",
    "the ancilla qubit @xmath131 , starting at state @xmath132 , experiences @xmath133 gates controlled by qubits @xmath23 and @xmath119 , and @xmath134 transformations , defined in @xcite as @xmath135 , as shown within the dotted pentagon in fig.([filterbox ] ) .",
    "all those transformations happened inside the dotted pentagon are equivalent to a toffoli gate except for some unimportant phases@xcite : if both qubits @xmath23 and @xmath119 are in state @xmath14 , then the ancilla qubit @xmath131 reverses to state @xmath136 , otherwise , it remains at state @xmath122 .",
    "after this nearly toffoli transformation , if at ground state electrons in qubit @xmath137 and ancilla qubit @xmath131 are found on rows labeled by @xmath138 , and if ancilla qubit 2 is at @xmath122 , then the three qubits will be at @xmath139 .",
    "thus if at ground state all electrons are found on rows immediately below both the dashed triangle and the dotted pentagon , and if ancilla qubit 1 is at @xmath128 and ancilla qubit 2 at @xmath122 , then the three qubits @xmath129 satisfy the clause : ||(|1|0|0+|0|1|0+|0|0|1 ) .",
    "[ ff ]    in order to make the satisfying states pass through the filter box with large probability , we add projection hamiltonians and boost hamiltonians as shown in the lower part of fig.([filterbox ] ) .",
    "the projection hamiltonians on final rows of the two ancilla qubits limit and amplify the amplitude of the states we prefer : ancilla qubit 1 at @xmath128 , and ancilla qubit 2 at @xmath122 . if a qubit does not experience any more clause , it will end with a boost hamiltonian , otherwise , its quantum state will be teleported to a new qubit through teleportation box , not shown in fig.([filterbox ] ) , and the new qubit experiences more clauses .",
    "thus the projection hamiltonians on two ancilla qubits and boost hamiltonians on the three qubits make sure that the ground - state wavefunction concentrates on the final rows in fig.([filterbox ] ) with state at eq.([ff ] ) .    noting that in the filter box all the three qubits @xmath140 and @xmath119 always act as control qubits , thus the entanglements of these three qubits with other qubits not involved in this particular clause still keep the same .",
    "when adding a clause , the resulted states satisfying this clause will also satisfy all previous applied clauses .",
    "thus unlike classical algorithm , no backtracking is needed .      in this subsection ,",
    "we assume applying each clause does decrease the number of satisfying state @xmath141 , or equivalently , the projection hamiltonian in the two ancilla qubits in each filter box , fig.([filterbox ] ) , does project appreciable part of state on the second last row .",

    ", it needs 10 teleportation boxes ( each teleportation box adds two more qubits ) on the original five - qubit circuit , noting that on the end of qubit @xmath117 and @xmath119 in fig.([filterbox ] ) teleportation boxes are needed because more clause will be added . thus adding one more filter box means adding 20 more qubits .",
    "the number of clause for a np hard 3-bit exact cover problem is about the same order as the number of bits @xmath0@xcite , say @xmath144 with @xmath29 being @xmath145 , then there are about @xmath146 qubits and each of them ends with either a projection or a boost hamiltonian .",
    "probability of finding all electrons at the final rows is approximately p(1-c/^2)^20n , where @xmath147 , the length of the longest qubit@xcite .",
    "it is assumed that , at ground state , in each filter box the ancilla qubit 1 and 2 have appreciable probability in @xmath14 and @xmath13 states , respectively , before projection hamiltonians .",
    "later we will address the situation when this assumption is violated .    in order to make the probability independent of number of bits @xmath0 , we take @xmath148 , where @xmath149 is an arbitrary number .",
    "then as @xmath0 becomes large , we obtain p(1-c/(dn))^20ne^-20c / d , [ p ] and energy gap is@xcite /^8/(d^4n^4 ) , from which one can estimate time cost .",
    "to make the gsqc circuit at ground state , we can use adiabatic approach : first we set @xmath150 for boost and projection hamiltonian on final rows of all qubits , and replace the single qubit hamiltonian between the first two rows of all qubits by a boost hamiltonian h(b,)= , so that the wavefunction amplitude of the first row is boosted as @xmath151 .",
    "now in the ground state the electrons concentrate at the first rows as @xmath152 , thus the ground state is easy to be prepared , and the energy gap @xmath153 with @xmath154 being the length of the longest qubit .",
    "the next step is turning the quantity @xmath155 to 1 adiabatically , during which the energy gap remains at @xmath156 and the ground - state wavefunction spreads to other rows from the first row .",
    "the third step is turning @xmath157 from 1 to @xmath158 adiabatically . in this process",
    "the energy gap decreases monotonically from @xmath156 to what we obtained above : @xmath159 , and the ground - state wavefunction concentrates on the final rows of all qubit as we wish .",
    "thus the scale of time cost is about @xmath160@xcite , local adiabatic approach may reduce the time cost further@xcite .      above analysis",
    "is under the assumption that the number of satisfying states gradually decreases as the clauses are implemented one by one .",
    "there is a situation that might hurt our algorithm : after adding one more clause , the number of satisfying states drops dramatically . just like what happens to grover s search algorithm , in which the number of satisfying states drops from @xmath112 to 1 , and as shown in eq.([fff ] ) , our algorithm involves a projection hamiltonian on an ancilla qubit to project an exponentially small fraction of a state , thus the energy gap evaluation in the above subsection becomes invalid .    does this happen to the general sat problems ?",
    "in @xcite it was suggested that close to the threshold @xmath142 computational complexity might be related with the forming of a backbone , each of a subset of bits has average value close to 1 or 0 in the subspace of satisfying states .",
    "the existence of the backbone means that most satisfying states contain the state represented by the backbone , and if adding one more clause kicks out the states consistent with the backbone from satisfying subspace , the number of satisfying states drops dramatically , and this corresponds to projecting a small fraction of state .",
    "performance of our algorithm is not affected by forming of backbone , however , as more clauses applied , the disappearance of the already existed backbone in the satisfying subspace surely hurts .",
    "there is a criterion determining efficiency of our algorithm : the ratio @xmath161 , with @xmath162 being the number of solutions when the @xmath23th clause is applied , and @xmath163 the number of solutions when the @xmath164th clause is applied .",
    "for example , @xmath165 for 3-bit exact cover problem .",
    "if @xmath166 , on the ancilla qubit of the @xmath164th filter box , the probability of finding electron on its final row will be @xmath167 . to make sure of appreciable probability of finding all electrons on the final row of all qubits , an overhead factor @xmath168 for @xmath27 on the ancilla qubit is needed , hence the amplifying factor in the projection hamiltonian on the ancilla qubit should be @xmath169 . according to the analysis in sec.[fraction ] ,",
    "the energy gap might be also determined by the parameter @xmath161 . because in a filter box , the ancilla qubit will end after the projection hamiltonian , which should be at the position of qubit 8 or qubit 10 in fig.([teleport ] ) without the dotted line following . according to the rule described in section [ fraction ] ,",
    "the parameter @xmath45 on this ancilla qubit should be = .",
    "the energy gap thus is = min ( , ) .",
    "if this ratio @xmath170 happens to be exponentially small , then our algorithm can not solve the sat problem in polynomial time .",
    "we can not know in advance what @xmath170 is , however , we might be able to identify backbone by trials , and then choose proper order to implement clauses so that @xmath170 always can be kept not too small .",
    "however , if the np - complete problem means that one can never avoid an exponentially small @xmath171 , then the quantum algorithm can not solve np - complete problem in polynomial time .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated that a ground state quantum computer can solve a general sat problem .",
    "a specific example , the 3-bit exact cover problem , is given .",
    "we show that a 3-bit exact cover problem can be solved by the quantum algorithm described here , and the time cost is related with the number of bits @xmath0 and the parameter @xmath170 .",
    "if @xmath170 stays only polynomially small , then the presented algorithm can solve this sat problem in polynomial time .",
    "it will be interesting if one finds the equivalent algorithm by standard paradigm .",
