    "in the standard external shock model of gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) the afterglow emission is produced when the ultra relativistic jet is decelerated by the interstellar medium ( meszaros & rees 1997 ) . during this phase",

    "here we consider the standard model of a uniform jet for grbs but the detection rate of oa has been explored ( rossi , perna & daigne 2008 ) also for a universal structured jet model ( rossi , lazzati & rees 2002 ; zhang & meszaros 2002 ) .    ) from the bulk of the population of grbs not pointing to the earth ( black symbols - with @xmath24 ) which can be detected as orphan afterglows . ,",

    "however , one challenge is how to disentangle the population of grb oa from other possible sources producing similar transients . in the radio band , the detection of grb afterglows ( chandra & frail 2012 ) benefits from the fact that the brightest phase of the emission happens on timescales of few days ( for grbs observed on  axis ) , because initially suppressed by self  absorption .",
    "this allows us to detect and follow the grb radio emission when the flux at higher frequencies is already below the sensitivity of available instruments .",
    "late time observations of radio emission from grbs is fundamental for constraining some key parameters of these sources ( e.g. berger , kulkarni & frail 2003 , 2004 ) and for estimating their global energetic ( frail , kulkarni & nicastro 1997 ; frail , metzger & berger 2004 ; shivvers & berger 2011 ; sironi & giannios 2013 ) .",

    "2013 ) and the murchinson widefield array ( mwa , bowman et al .",
    "2013 , tingay et al . 2013 ) will scan the sky with unprecedented survey speed , thanks to their field of view . nonetheless as far as the search for oa is concerned , these will be likely limited to the exceptionally bright sources . in the ghz band ,",
    "the most promising telescopes -in terms of dynamic range and fields of view- for the systematic search for transients are the australian ska - pathfinder ( askap , johnston et al .",
    "2007 ) , the aperture tiles in focus ( apertif ) experiment , a wide field upgrade to the westerbrok synthesis radio telescope ( verheijen et al . 2008 ) , and the meerkat telescope .",
    "while the mhz telescopes are already operative , the ghz ska pathfinders will take first light in the next 25 years .    in order to study the detectability of oa with on  going and future surveys it is necessary to know the emission properties ( timescales and flux level ) of the population of oa which depend on the properties ( energetics , distance scale , jet opening angle ) of the population of grbs . in this paper",
    "we use a population synthesis code psyche ( ghirlanda et al . 2013a ; 2013b )",
    "summarised in  2 which has already been used to predict the detectability of on  axis grb afterglows in the radio band ( ghirlanda et al .",

    "we explore the detectability of oa by future radio surveys in  5 .",
    "ghirlanda et al . (",
    "2013a - g13 hereafter ) built a population synthesis code which simulates grbs ( i ) distributed in the universe up to @xmath25 according to the grb formation rate ( salvaterra et al .",

    "each burst is oriented with respect to the line of sight with a viewing angle  ( distributed as the @xmath26  probability density function ) .",
    "the starting assumption of psyche is that all grbs have a standard comoving frame energy @xmath27 erg and a unique comoving frame prompt emission peak energy @xmath28 kev .",
    "this assumption is motivated by the clustering of these quantities found when correcting for the beaming factor , estimated from the peak of the afterglow light curve ( liang et al .",
    "2010 ; ghirlanda et al . 2012 ; lu et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "the energetic of each simulated burst is then determined by  ( =) and the isotropic equivalent energy by  and  ( = /(1-cos ) ) .",
    "the simulation free parameters ( e.g. the parameters of the log  normal distributions of  and ) are determined by reproducing the observed properties of the grb samples observed by different satellites : ( a ) the flux distribution and ( b ) the empirical  correlation of bat6 , i.e. a complete sample of bright  grbs ( salvaterra et al .",

    "in particular , constraint ( a ) is used to normalise the grb population so that the number of simulated bursts with peak flux @xmath142.6 ph cm@xmath7 s@xmath8 matches the rate of grbs ( @xmath3015 sr@xmath8 yr@xmath8 ) detected by -bat above this flux threshold .",
    "the grbs used as observational constraints by psyche are bursts that are pointing towards the earth ( i.e. with @xmath14 ) , indeed their prompt emission has been detected by different satellites ( , , ) .",
    "however , the code simulates also grbs seen off  axis .",
    "this is because one of the scopes of g13 was to describe the parent population of bursts , of which only a minor fraction ( with @xmath14 ) can be detected in the @xmath0ray band .",
    "the simulated population of grbs is shown in fig.[fg1 ] where the viewing angle  is plotted against the jet opening angle .",
    "it is evident that the jet angle distribution  is log  normal , while the clustering of the population towards large  values is the effect of the probability function of .",
    "the population is composed by a minor fraction ( @xmath132.4% ) of grbs that are  pointing \" towards the earth ( i.e. with @xmath14 ) which can be detected by @xmath0ray detectors ( blue symbols in fig.[fg1 ] ) and a majority of bursts that are off  axis with @xmath16  ( black symbols in fig.[fg1 ] ) .",
    "the latter are events that can be potentially detected at any frequency except that in the @xmath0ray band and are called oa .",
    "therefore , a description of the properties of the entire grb population should also consider the grbs that are off  axis and are detectable only as oa . according to the results of psyche ,",
    "the ratio of the off  axis to on  axis bursts ( i.e. black vs. blue dots in fig.[fg1 ] ) is @xmath1340 , smaller than the typical value obtained by assuming that all grbs have = 3@xmath31 .",
    "this is due to the distribution of  that we find with psyche to be a log  normal ( see g13 for details ) . through our simulation",
    "we find that the rate of oa is @xmath32 yr@xmath8 sr@xmath8 ( i.e. @xmath1310 yr@xmath8 deg@xmath7 ) .",
    "one of our aims is to derive the detectability of oas with current and future radio surveys .",
    "we consider here the flux at the brightest phase of the oa emission .",
    "this happens at a characteristic time @xmath33 when the bulk lorentz factor @xmath34 .",
    "although the flux starts to rise before this time , when the edge of the jet ( that we assume here to have a sharp top - hat conical section ) closer to the viewing angle becomes visible ( i.e. when @xmath35(- ) ) , the peak flux of the orphan afterglow happens when all the jet is visible . for @xmath36 the light curve as seen by an observer off ",
    "axis is the same as that seen by an on  axis observer .",
    "the peak of the oa emission is reached when the afterglow is still described by the relativistic blandford - mckee ( 1976 ) self similar solution which relates the bulk lorentz factor @xmath37 with the distance @xmath38 from the central source , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the kinetic energy driving the expansion of the fireball into the interstellar medium of density @xmath41 .",

    "the oa emission peaks on average a few years after the grb event .",
    "however , the relevant timescale for oa studies and detection (  5 ) is their duration because there is no starting reference time coincident with the grb prompt emission ( which is undetected for oa ) .",
    "the time when the oa emission starts to be visible @xmath55 , at a very low flux level , is when @xmath56",
    ". then the flux rises reaching a peak at @xmath33 and decays afterwards in the same way as it would if seen from an on  axis observer . in order to define a duration , we consider the difference between the time when the jet becomes non ",

    "the afterglow emission becomes observable when the bulk lorentz factor , which is decreasing during the afterglow phase , becomes @xmath73 . after this time , which represents the peak of the oa light curve , the emission is similar to that for an observer within the jet opening angle .",
    "oa make up a majority of the population of grbs .",
    "however , none have been observed so far , do to their lack of a prompt emission trigger .",
    "their detection is possible as transients in deep / wide field surveys .",
    "however , so far no detection of oa has been confirmed by searches in archival optical / radio observations . in current and future surveys",
    "oa might represent a considerable fraction of detected transients .    in this paper",
    "we have used the results of a population synthesis code for grbs ( g13 ) that simulates the entire population of grbs including off - axis events and is anchored to reproduce some observational constraints of the population of grbs detected  and  with particular emphasis on the constraints given by the bat6 complete  sample ( salvaterra et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "we have explored the properties of the population of off  axis grbs ( see fig.[fg1 ] - black symbols ) in terms of their radio emission .",
    "we have computed the radio flux density of the oa population ( representing @xmath1397% of the entire grb simulated population ) at the time when the oa light curve reaches its peak ( fig.[fg2 ] ) which is of the order of few years after the prompt trigger",
    ". however , the lack of any prompt emission ( i.e. @xmath0ray trigger ) in oa , requires to compute the timescale of their duration which , given the typical rise / decay long  term evolution of the afterglow flux , can be of the same order of the peak time .",
    "this suggest that oa in the radio band should be slow transients .",
    "we have constructed the cumulative flux distribution at different radio frequencies ( ghz and mhz ) that shows a high flux tail with a slope consistent with @xmath4 ( fig.[fg3 ] ) and a break at a frequency dependent flux below which the slope becomes flatter ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "this is due to the combination of the  distribution of the population of simulated bursts with the viewing angle  probability function : at approximately 10@xmath31 the product of the  log  normal distribution ( resulting from the population code of g13 ) and of the probability density of  is maximised .",
    "this accounts for the slope change of the flux distributions in fig.[fg3 ] , the break of the flux distribution is shifted to lower fluxes at lower frequencies because the radio emission is in the self absorbed regime of the synchrotron spectrum .    in general , from fig.[fg3 ]",
    "we note that very bright oa with flux at the 1 mjy level are rare .",
    "this is the central flux of the current radio searches / surveys that have been searching for oas .",
    "our population is consistent with the limits given by these surveys .",
    "totani & panaitescu ( 2002 ) derived the flux distribution of orphan afterglows based on 10 bright grb afterglows .",
    "our estimates are consistent in the bright flux end with their but we predict a lower number of oa at low fluxes ( below the break of our flux distribution ) .",
    "this is due to the modelling , in our case , of the grb jet opening angle distribution ( g13 ) .",
    "in g13 we derived that @xmath130.3% of sn ib / c may harbour a grb , i.e. in other words the great majority of the putative progenitors of grbs do not produce a relativistic jet . when compared to the combined samples of s06 and b13 , which comprise 112 sn ib / c ,",
    "there were indeed only two detections and we statistically expect none of them to be an off - axis grb . both sn 2001em and sn 2003gk were successively showed not to expand at relativistic velocity , arguing against their being genuine oas .",
    "finally , we showed ( in fig .",
    "[ fg5 ] ) that all upper limits on sn ib / c radio emission at late times are indeed consistent with the distribution of grb oas in the plane @xmath72  .",
