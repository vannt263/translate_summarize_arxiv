    "field - effect - transistors ( fets ) have emerged as promising devices for sensitive and fast room temperature detection of terahertz ( thz ) radiation  @xcite .",
    "they are considered as a good candidate for real - time thz imaging and spectroscopic analysis  @xcite as well as future thz wireless communications  @xcite .",
    "devices employing plasmonic effects in fets have already been applied for room temperature detection of radiation with frequencies from tens of ghz up to several thz and enable the combination of individual detectors in a matrix .",
    "they are characterized by high responsivity ( up to a few kv / w ) , low noise equivalent power ( down to 10 pw/@xmath1 ) , fast response time ( tens of picoseconds ) and large dynamic range ( linear power response up to 10 kw/@xmath2 ) , see e.g. ref.@xcite .",
    "the operation principle of fet thz detectors used so far is based on the nonlinear properties of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) plasma in the transistor channel .",
    "the standard dyakonov - shur model  @xcite assumes that radiation is coupled to the transistor by an effective antenna , which generates an @xmath3 voltage predominantly on one side of the transistor .",
    "both resonant  @xcite and non - resonant  @xcite regimes of thz detection have been studied .",
    "while research aimed to development of thz fet detectors is focused on single gate structures recently several groups have shown that higher sensitivities are expected for structures with periodic symmetric and asymmetric metal stripes or gates  @xcite .",
    "in particular , dual - grating - gate fet are considered as a good candidate for sensitive thz detection .",
    "the first data obtained on dual - gated - structures demonstrated a substantial enhancement of the photoelectric response and an ability to control detector parameters by variation of individual gate bias voltage  @xcite . at the same time , thz electric field applied to fets with asymmetric periodic dual gate structure is expected to give rise to electronic ratchet effects  @xcite ( for review see  @xcite ) and plasmonic ratchet effects  @xcite .",

    "we show that artificial non - centrosymmetric microperiodic structures with a two - dimensional electron system excited by thz radiation exhibit a @xmath0 photocurrent caused by the lateral asymmetry of the applied static potential and terahertz electric field .",
    "we demonstrate that depending on gate voltages applied to the individual gratings of the dual - grating - gate the response can be proportional to either the stokes parameters  @xcite defining the radiation helicity or those for linear polarization . as an important result , for a wide range of gate voltages we observed a photocurrent @xmath4 being proportional to the radiation helicity @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are intensities of right- and left - handed circularly polarized light . for the circular photocurrent @xmath4 measured between source and drain contacts",

    "[ fig04 ] also reproduces well the results previously obtained for similar structures  @xcite .",
    "even the fact that the maximum of the signal in various structures has been obtained for different directions of the electric field vector in respect to @xmath23-direction ( source - drain ) has already been reported for these transistors and attributed to the antenna coupling of mw radiation to transistor , see ref .",
    "the observation of the circular photocurrent and the sign - alternating linear photocurrent @xmath69 reveals that a microscopic process actuating these photocurrents goes beyond the plasmonic dyakonov - shur model typically applied to discuss operation of fets thz detectors .",

    "@xcite , the dyakonov - shur model in fact may result in the circular photocurrent but only due to interference effects of two different channels and two interacting antennas in small size special design fets - the model which can hardly be applied to the large dgg samples used in our experiments . at the same time , the observed polarization behavior is characteristic for the electronic ratchet effects excited in asymmetric periodic structures  @xcite and linear / circular plasmonic ratchet effects  @xcite .",
    "the ratchet currents arise due to the phase shift between the periodic potential and the periodic light electric field resulting from near field diffraction in a system with broken symmetry .",
    "microscopic theory developed in ref .",

    "( [ fitphi ] ) , being in agreement with experimental observation shown in figs .",
    "[ fig02 ] ,  [ fig03 ] and [ fig04](a ) .",
    "moreover , as the ratchet photocurrents are proportional to the degree of the in - plane asymmetry , they reverse the sign upon inversion of static potential asymmetry . exactly this behavior has been observed in experiment , see fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the proportionality to the degree of lateral asymmetry also explain the increase of the signal with raising voltage applied to one gate at constant voltage by the other .",
    "the interplay of the degree of lateral asymmetry and periodic modulation of thz electric field results in the complex gate - voltage dependence , in particular , for @xmath99 .",
    "as the different individual contributions to the total current effect might imply different microscopic mechanisms of the photocurrent formation , their behavior upon change of external parameters can distinct from each other .",
    "this would result in a sign - alternating gate - voltage behavior , in particular for the range of comparable @xmath36 and @xmath45 , like it is observed in experiment , see fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] ( c ) .",
    "while all qualitative features of the observed phenomena can be rather good described in terms of ratchet effects we would like to address another possible effect , which might trigger the helicity - driven photocurrent .",
    "it could be the differential plasmonic drag effect in the two - dimensional structure with an asymmetric double - grating gate considered in refs .",
    "@xcite . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite for a periodic alas / ingaas / inalas / inp structure and linearly polarized thz radiation , photon drag effect can be comparable in strength with the plasmonic ratchet effect at thz frequencies .",
    "as the circular photon drag effect has been observed in different low dimensional materials  @xcite we can expect that modification of the theory developed in  @xcite can also yield helicity driven plasmonic drag current compatible with the ratchet one .    finally , we note that the ratchet effects ( either electronic or plasmonic ) can be greatly increased due to the resonant enhancement of the near - field in two - dimensional electron system at the plasmon resonance excitation as it was shown for the plasmonic ratchet in refs .",
    "the resonant plasmon condition @xmath100 , see ref .",
    "@xcite can be well satisfied in our structure ( @xmath101 at 2.54  thz ) . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the fundamental plasmon resonance is excited in a similar structure at frequency around 2  thz .",
    "therefore , the plasmon resonance excitation can contribute to the observed ratchet effects independently of particular microscopic mechanisms of the ratchet photocurrent formation .",
    "the measurements in a broader thz frequency range could elucidate the role of the plasmonic resonance excitation in the ratchet photocurrent enhancement .",
    "to summarize , our measurements demonstrate that dual - grating - gate inalas / ingaas / inalas / inp excited by terahertz radiation can yield a helicity sensitive photocurrent response at thz frequencies .",
    "we show , that hemts with asymmetric lateral superlattice of gate fingers with unequal widths and spacing can be applied for generation of a photocurrent defined by linearly and circularly radiation polarization components .",
    "moreover , one can obtain photoresponse being proportional to one of the stokes parameters simply by variation of voltages applied to the individual gates .",
    "the photocurrent formations can be well described in terms of ratchet effects excited by terahertz radiation . by",
    "that the lateral grating induces a periodical lateral potential acting on the 2d electron gas in qw .",
    "this grating also modulates the incident radiation in the near field and hence in the plane of the 2des , resulting in circular , linear and polarization - independent ratchet effects .",
    "while the responsivity of the polarization dependent response is lower than that reported for fet transistors it can be substantially improved by optimization of the structure design leading the resonant enhancement of the ratchet effects the plasmon resonance excitation .",

    "<S> we report on the observation of a radiation helicity sensitive photocurrent excited by terahertz ( thz ) radiation in dual - grating - gate ( dgg ) inalas / ingaas / inalas / inp high electron mobility transistors ( hemt ) . for a circular polarization </S>",
    "<S> the current measured between source and drain contacts changes its sign with the inversion of the radiation helicity . for elliptically polarized radiation the total current </S>",
    "<S> is described by superposition of the stokes parameters with different weights . moreover , by variation of gate voltages applied to individual gratings the photocurrent can be defined either by the stokes parameter defining the radiation helicity or those for linear polarization . </S>",
    "<S> we show that artificial non - centrosymmetric microperiodic structures with a two - dimensional electron system excited by thz radiation exhibit a @xmath0 photocurrent caused by the combined action of a spatially periodic in - plane potential and spatially modulated light . </S>",
    "<S> the results provide a proof of principle for the application of dgg hemt for all - electric detection of the radiation s polarization state . </S>"
