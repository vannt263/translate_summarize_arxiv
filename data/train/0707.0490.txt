    "the abundances of the light elements ( deuterium , helium and lithium ) form one of the cornerstones of big bang nucleosynthesis theory and can all be used as baryometers , yielding the density of baryons in the universe as a fraction of the closure density , .",
    "although the light element abundances are actually a direct probe of the baryon - to - photon ratio , @xmath0 , this can be translated to  using the ( now well - known ) cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature .",
    "deuterium is by far the most sensitive of the light elements to @xmath0 , and thus the baryon density , and determining the primordial value of d / h ( the deuterium to hydrogen abundance ) has been the focus of intense research efforts over the last three decades ( e.g. york & rogerson 1976 ; vidal - madjar et al . 1977 ; laurent , vidal - madjar & york 1979 ; pettini & bowen 2001 ; omeara et al .",

    "these efforts have made a two - pronged attack , by measuring d / h abundances both in the milky way and at high redshifts .",
    "although d is not produced in any significant quantities after big bang nucleosynthesis , it is easily astrated in stars , so measurements at high redshifts could potentially yield the primordial abundance more readily than observations in the local universe .",
    "high redshift measurements can be achieved with observations of high hi column density absorption systems in the lines of sight towards qsos , such as the damped lyman alpha systems ( dlas ) and lyman limit systems ( llss ) . however , since the di lyman @xmath1 line is only separated from that of hi by @xmath2 80 km / s , only those rare absorbers with very simple velocity structure yield reliable results .",
    "thus , despite a decade of high redshift work , only six robust measurements of d / h at high redshift currently exist ( omeara et al .",
    "2001 ; pettini & bowen 2001 ; kirkman et al . 2003 ; omeara et al .",
    "2006 ) . nonetheless , these measurements paint a relatively coherent picture and yield an  ( inferred from a mean d / h = ( 2.8@xmath30.4 ) @xmath4 ) that is in solid agreement ( i.e. within the 1 @xmath5 errors ) with that determined from cmb experiments such as wmap ( see pettini 2006 for a review ) .",
    "measurements of d / h in the milky way complement high redshift observations by providing an order of magnitude more sightlines in which abundances can be measured ( see linsky et al .",
    "2006 for the most recent compilation ) .",
    "although some astration has probably occurred , the highest galactic d / h ratios set a lower limit to the primordial abundance .",
    "moreover , modelling the amount of astration inferred from sub - primordial abundances provides clues to the rate at which material has been processed in stars  a vital ingredient in chemical evolution models . for these reasons ,",
    "one of the principle drivers of the far - ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) was to compile a large database of galactic d / h measurements : ` the main science goal of the fuse mission has been to obtain accurate measurements of ( d / h)@xmath6 for many sightlines in the milky way galaxy and beyond in order to measure ( d / h)@xmath7 and to obtain constraints on galactic chemical evolution ' ( linsky et al .",
    "2006 ) . however , despite a massive investment of telescope resources from both fuse and other satellite facilities , and measurements of d / h in almost 50 lines of sight , the picture of galactic deuterium abundances remains puzzling . on the one hand , inside the local bubble ( @xmath8 100 pc from the sun )",
    "the d / h value seems roughly constant at 1.5 @xmath4 , approximately 60% of the primordial value .",
    "however , beyond this bound , there is a large scatter in the d / h ratios which can not be easily explained by astration ( jenkins et al .",
    "1999 ; wood et al .  2004",
    "; draine , 2006 ) .",
    "as pointed out by draine ( 2006 ) , there is an observed factor of five range in d / h for clouds within 100 pc .",
    "it is difficult to reconcile such disparate abundances , on such small spatial scales , within a chemical evolution model , particularly since mixing should be efficient on these scales ( e.g. romano et al .",
    "2006 ) .    at the present time ,",
    "the most favoured explanation for the variation in galactic d / h ratios is the depletion of deuterium from the gas phase onto grains .",
    "deuterium depletion was first suggested over 20 years ago by jura ( 1982 ) and then explored theoretically by tielens ( 1983 ) .",
    "the most recent theoretical work has been done by draine ( 2004 , 2006 ) who suggested that deuterated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) in cold dust could be sufficient sinks for deuterium to explain the scatter in galactic measurements .",
    "empirical support for d depletion comes from the composition of interstellar grains collected in the upper terrestrial atmosphere which can be enriched by d relative to the usual meteoritic composition ( keller , messenger & bradley 2000 ) . whilst the quantity of deuterium was not sufficient to explain the galactic ism abundances ,",
    "the presence of dust phase d does act as a ` proof of concept ' .",
    "one empirical test of the depletion scenario is to look for correlations between d / h and the abundances of other refractory elements .",
    "this test was first done by prochaska , tripp & howk ( 2005 ) using far - blue optical lines of ti  ii measured in keck / hires spectra for seven galactic sightlines .",
    "prochaska et al .",
    "( 2005 ) noted a possible correlation at the 95% level , although this was strongly driven by a single high d / h sightline .",
    "moreover , prochaska et al . note that the literature limit for a second high d / h sightline ( @xmath9 vel ) does not agree with the overall trend in their data and that there is a large scatter in ti / h at low d / h .",
    "more recently , linsky et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have presented corroborating evidence for depletion correlations based on si and fe ; both elements show significant abundance trends with d / h .",
    "linsky et al .",
    "also tentatively suggest that a possible correlation between d / h and the gas temperature derived from h@xmath10 may also support the dust scenario .",
    "savage et al . (",
    "2007 ) have also supported the dust depletion model , since their high value ( 2.2@xmath4 ) of d / h in the warm neutral medium of the galactic halo is consistent with expulsion of material from the disk and associated ablation of dust particles .    [",

    "the abundance of ti , on both linear ( in units of parts per billion , ppb ) and logarithmic ( relative to solar ) scales is plotted versus d / h in units of ppm . for logarithmic abundances ,",
    "we use the standard notation [ x / h ] = log ( x / h ) @xmath11 log ( x / h)@xmath12 , which is analogous to the notation d(x ) used by linsky et al .",
    "for solar abundances , we use the compilation of lodders ( 2003 ) , except for oxygen , for which we adopt the value from holweger ( 2001 ) where a full non - lte treatment was adopted .",
    "these values are log [ n(x)@xmath12/n(h)@xmath12 ] = @xmath14 for si , fe , ti and o respectively .",
    "for convenience , in table [ abund ] we show the relative abundances used for figures [ tih ] and [ nh_fig ] .",
    "we include data from prochaska et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and perform a least - squares fit of the form @xmath15 to the final ti sample which consists of 16 detections .",
    "the best fit straight line for [ ti / h ] has values @xmath16 and @xmath17 where errors were determined by randomly re - generating the [ ti / h ] vs. d / h distribution 1000 times based on the quoted 1 @xmath5 errors .",
    "spearman s rank correlation statistic is 0.55 , yielding a rejection of the null hypothesis ( that there is no correlation ) at the 97% level .",
    "in addition to the enlargement of the sample size , one of the important contributions of this work is the inclusion of 3 new high d / h data points , as well as the lowest d / h in the current sample .",
    "the correlation of prochaska et al .",
    "( 2005 ) was pivotal upon a single high datum ( feige 110 ) ; removal of this one point reduces the significance of the correlation from 95% to 86% .",
    "moreover , for one other high d / h sightline in the literature , prochaska et al .",
    "( 2005 ) pointed out that the upper limit for @xmath9 vel ( d / h=21.9 ppm ) of [ ti / h]@xmath18 reported by welsh et al .",
    "( 1997 ) was potentially inconsistent with the depletion trend . with a larger sample , and more high d / h points",
    ", we can now make a more robust assessment of the d / h correlation .",
    "first , we find that with higher s / n data , the measured value of [ ti / h]=@xmath19 for @xmath9 vel is in actually excellent agreement with the high d / h point ( feige 110 ) presented in prochaska et al .",
    "moreover , the highest d / h sightline ( hd41161 ) in our sample is also in good agreement with the general trend of increasing ti / h with d / h .",
    "however , the third high d / h sightline , wd1034 + 001 exhibits a low ti / h for its d / h , although this point has the largest error bars on its measured n(ti  ii ) column density due to the low significance of the detection ( see figure [ lines3 ] and tables [ results ] and [ abund ] ) .    given",
    "the discrepancy noted above between the literature upper limit and our measured value for [ ti / h ] towards @xmath9 vel , it is interesting to compare other sightlines for which literature values also exist .",
    "welsh et al .",
    "( 1997 ) report a limit on the column density of ti  ii towards @xmath20 car that is half of our measured value and the discrepancy towards @xmath21 pup is even higher : 0.45 dex , almost a factor of three . however , the ca  ii abundances in the sightlines common to this work and welsh et al .",
    "( 1997 ) are in good agreement within the errors , with differences @xmath22 0.08 dex .",
    "hunter et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have also previously noted consistency in n(ca  ii ) and discrepancies in n(ti  ii ) between high s / n uves data and previous works , whose s / n ratios are typically @xmath8 50 .",
    "hunter et al . attributed this to the weakness of the ti  ii lines , relative to ca  ii .",
    "confirmation of this effect here highlights the importance of very high s / n ratios and spectral resolution to make these measurements accurately .",
    "previous authors have interpreted the correlation between the gas - phase abundance of refractory elements and ( d / h ) as evidence that differential depletion leads to low values for each ( prochaska et al .",
    "2005 ; linsky et al .",
    "although the trend traced by our enlarged sample of ti / h values supports this interpretation qualitatively , a closer examination of the results leads to a less clear cut picture .",
    "focus first on the abundance trends from different elements . in figure [ tih ]",
    "we overlay the fits for depletion of fe and si from linsky et al .",
    "( 2006 ) with our own ti results .",
    "if dust depletion is the cause of the correlation of abundance with d / h then we expect a steeper gradient for more refractory elements . in the case of ti , fe and si ,",
    "the former is the most refractory and the latter the least sensitive to depletion ( e.g. savage & sembach 1996 ) .",
    "the relative gradients in figure [ tih ] are therefore inconsistent with our simple predictions from a ` standard ' depletion scenario , since we would expect ti to be considerably steeper than fe or si .",
    "indeed , the gradient seen in ti is only marginally steeper than that found for [ o / h ] which is only very mildly refractory .",
    "therefore , although the existence of trends between refractory elements and d / h support a picture of dust depletion , quantitatively the gradients are inconsistent with this scenario .",
    "steigman , romano & tosi ( 2007 ) have also questioned the dust depletion scenario due to their failure to find a trend between line of sight reddening and d / h , as one might have expected were dust the cause of lower d / h values .    in section [ analysis_sec ]",
    "we argued that saturation of the ti  ii lines is unlikely to be a serious concern .",
    "however , some of the fe  ii and si  ii transitions have considerably higher optical depths ( e.g. , redfield & linsky 2002 ) .",
    "there is an anti - correlation between [ fe / h ] and n(fe  ii ) in the compilation of linsky et al .",
    "if saturation systematically under - estimates n(fe  ii ) for the low [ fe / h ] data points , the true slope of the correlation with d / h will be flatter than observed .",
    "however , this effect is unlikely to be large enough to yield a true gradient of [ fe / h ] versus d / h that is flatter than the [ ti / h ] versus d / h correlation .",
    "moreover , there is a mild correlation between [ si / h ] and n(si  ii ) , so that any correction for saturation would make the dotted line in figure [ tih ] steeper , thus accentuating the difference with the [ ti / h ] correlation .",
    "it is also possible that the d lines may suffer from saturation , and this may be particularly relevent for the high n(hi ) lines of sight studied here .",
    "however , it is difficult to apply horizontal shifts to the d / h values in our sample that would make the correlation with [ ti / h ] steeper .",
    "it therefore seems unlikely that saturation effects can explain the relative slopes in figure [ tih ] .",
    "we can further investigate depletion trends by considering correlations with mean hydrogen densities .",
    "it is well known that depletion in the galactic ism correlates with , the mean volume density of hydrogen ( e.g. savage & bohlin 1979 ; phillips , gondhalekar & pettini 1982 ; spitzer 1985 ; gondhalekar 1985 ; jenkins et al .",
    "2004 ) where    @xmath23    we calculate  for the 17 sight lines in our ti  ii sample and supplement them with five more sight lines in linsky et al .",

    "jenkins ( 2004 ) parametrized ism abundances in terms of a depletion factor , @xmath24 , which in turn correlates with .",
    "we performed a fit to the correlation between @xmath24 and  and using the parameters in jenkins ( 2004 ) , determined the corresponding relationship between  and abundance for the 144 galactic stars in his sample .",
    "for ti , si and fe we determine :    @xmath25= -2.226 ( 0.4<n(h ) > + 0.8 ) - 0.844 - 0.01\\ ] ]    @xmath26 = -1.076 ( 0.4<n(h)>+0.8 ) - 0.223\\ ] ]    @xmath27 = -1.198 ( 0.4<n(h ) > + 0.8 ) - 0.95 + 0.02\\ ] ]    the final term in the equations for [ ti / h ] and [ fe / h ] account for the slightly different solar abundance scale adopted by jenkins ( 2004 ) .",
    "this relationship between  and ism abundances is over - plotted with our data in figure [ nh_fig ] .",
    "the correlation between [ ti / h ] and depletion factor in jenkins ( 2004 ) is very steep ( the steepest of the 15 elements he studies ) , and very tight ( reduced @xmath28=0.95 ) .",
    "the best least squares fit to our ti data is shown by the dashed line in the top left panel of figure [ nh_fig ] .",
    "the slope is clearly much flatter than that reported jenkins ( 2004 ) and flatter than both the least squares fits for fe and si .",
    "moreover , the correlation between [ ti / h ] and  is not statistically significant : the spearman rank correlation coefficient rules out the null hypothesis at @xmath29 ( 83% ) significance .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the abundance of si , which is the least depleted of the three elements discussed here , has the steepest gradient with .",
    "this reflects the same , unexpected result presented in figure [ tih ] , i.e. that the depletion fractions seem to be inverted relative to our expectations .",
    "this may indicate that the normal circumstances which govern the correlation between depletion and density in the ism at large is not at work in these local ( mostly @xmath30 pc ) sightlines .",
    "however , we should also stress that we have many fewer sightlines than the jenkins sample , so that small number statistics could contribute to the absence of a tight correlation . also noteworthy",
    "is the lack of correlation , and very large scatter at any given density , of [ d / h ] represents the abundance relative to the primordial value , which we take to be 26 ppm . ] .",
    "we have only plotted in figure [ nh_fig ] those stars in our ti  ii sample . the same plot , but with a much larger sample extending to lower values of , has been recently presented by oliveira et al .",
    "( 2006 ) who note that the scatter in d / h increases dramatically when  @xmath31 0.1 , the regime in which most of our points lie .",
    "if lower d / h values do result from differential depletion , it appears from our figure [ nh_fig ] that this depletion does not correlate with .",
    "oliveira et al . ( 2006 ) have attempted to fit an abundance / depletion model to their larger dataset and claim an anti - correlation between d / h and .",
    "however , the reduced @xmath28 for this fit is large ( 5.8 ) , the scatter in d / h for a given  is @xmath2 1 dex ( similar to what is seen in our data ) and the anti - correlation driven by just 2 data points .",
    "indeed , some of the highest d / h values occur at the highest .",
    "we therefore conclude that there is no convincing evidence for an anti - correlation between  and d / h as one might expect from dust depletion .",
    "although the acceptance of dust depletion as the cause of the local variations of deuterium is gaining momentum , our results indicate that this interpretation is not clear cut .",
    "the same conclusion has also been recently reached by steigman et al .",
    "( 2007 ) who consider the evidence for dust depletion as ` ambiguous ' .",
    "however , the above discussion assumes a very simple approach to the behaviour of dust in the local ism .",
    "there are several caveats that should therefore be applied , such as the many flavours of dust that exist with different chemical compositions and the fact that dust production and destruction is likely to be a dynamic process .",
    "moreover , current models of deuterium depletion involve d incorporation into deuterated pahs ( draine 2004 , 2006 ) , different again from the grains which adsorb most refractory elements .",
    "combined with the sightline averaged quantities that we are necessarily dealing with , some scatter in abundance relations is perhaps not surprising and we return to this issue in section [ scatter_sec ] .",
    "shocks may also disrupt ` normal ' depletion patterns .",
    "for example , weak shocks may be sufficient to release d from the dust phase ( since deuterated pahs are relatively fragile ) , whereas much stronger shocks may be required to ablate ti grain material .",
    "these issues highlight the complexity of the ism and abundance ratios and the caution that should be exercised in the interpretation that they are driven by dust .",
    "an alternative scenario to the depletion of deuterium onto grains is the infall of unenriched gas from the halo which dilutes the abundance of chemical elements .",
    "knauth , meyer & lauroesch ( 2006 ) have recently suggested local infall to explain the difference in n / o abundances at @xmath32 pc , compared with closer sightlines .",
    "romano et al . ( 2006 ) have also combined infall with astration to result in the relatively modest destruction ( @xmath33 = ( d / h ) @xmath7/ ( d / h)@xmath34 ) of deuterium from its primordial value . in",
    "most _ simple _ infall scenarios , the infalling gas has a d / h abundance that is close to the primordial value ( i.e. higher than typical ism values ) , whilst the abundances of other elements are lower than in the ambient disk ism .",
    "this would result in an anti - correlation between heavy element abundance and d / h ( e.g. steigman et al . 2007 ) , rather than the positive correlations depicted in figure [ tih ] .",
    "infall of low metallicity material could only explain the positive correlations seen in figure [ tih ] if the infalling low metallicity gas is also poor in deuterium .",
    "although unlikely , we briefly explore this possibility here .",
    "one might discriminate between the two scenarios of dust depletion versus various infall scenarios by examining relative abundances of different heavy elements .",
    "if infall of unenriched ( or low metallicity , but with a solar abundance pattern ) gas is responsible for the spatial variations in d / h , the relative abundances of two elements with similar nucleosynthetic origins should not correlate with d / h .",
    "conversely , if the same two elements have different refractory properties , they should vary with d / h if depletion is the cause of variations in the deuterium abundance . in figure [ tio ]",
    "we compare the abundances of ti and o , which are both @xmath1 elements whose enrichment comes mainly through type ii supernovae of massive stars . applying the above logic",
    ", one would expect a flat distribution of ti / o vs. d / h in the infall scenario , but a positive correlation with d / h for dust depletion .",
    "the spearman rank correlation coefficient is @xmath110.1 , which indicates that there is no significant correlation between ti / o and d / h , and the negative value actually indicates the data tend to an anti - correlation .",
    "unfortunately , this test is not conclusive , since the very mild dependence of ti / h on d / h ( figure [ tih ] ) spans a factor of three less ( 0.5 dex ) than the scatter in the ti / o ratios at a given d / h .",
    "we have already argued that a ` standard ' infall scenario with low metallicity , enhanced d / h gas would cause an anti - correlation between [ x / h ] and d / h .",
    "although d - poor infall could qualitatively explain the positive correlations in figure [ tih ] , again the gradients provide strong evidence against this possibility .",
    "if infalling gas has a low metallicity , but a solar abundance pattern , then in a plot of [ x / h ] vs. d / h , every element should have the same gradient ( ignoring all other effects such as depletion , ionization etc . ) .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that each element is diluted by the same amount and with a logarithmic ordinate , the @xmath35 is a measure of the dilution factor .",
    "the very different slopes seen in figure [ tih ] therefore argue against a d - poor infall model , although we can not rule out more contrived models with highly non - solar abundances .",
    "however , combined with other evidence against the infall model , such as the relative constancy of certain elements such as o and kr ( oliveira et al . 2005 ; cartledge et al .",
    "2004 ) and the sharp transition from approximately constant d / h inside the local bubble to a large scatter at distances beyond 100 pc , which would require a coincidentally very localized region of infall ( e.g. de avillez & mac low 2002 ) , we conclude that infall is unlikely to be the main cause of local d / h variations .",
    "this is not to say that the local ism is a closed box , in fact romano et al .",
    "( 2006 ) require some infall to explain the modest astration between the primordial d abundance and the local values .      in closing this section , we note that for a given d / h , there is a wide range of observed [ ti / h ] abundances , spanning up to a factor of three ( figure [ tih ] ) .",
    "the scatter means that some d / h@xmath210 ppm sightlines have [ ti / h ] as high as the highest d / h sightlines , and vice versa .",
    "linsky et al .",
    "( 2006 ) discussed a number of factors that might contribute scatter in the relationship between element depletion and d / h such as line saturation of di transitions , ionization corrections and n(hi ) determination .",
    "the former of these may affect our results , although when saturation is obvious , we remove the sight line from our analysis ( e.g. hd 206773 ) . however , we expect the latter two concerns to be alleviated by our choice of high n(hi ) sight lines",
    ". the more obvious damping wings should facilitate the determination of n(hi ) that can be more challenging for log n(hi ) @xmath8 19 and the gas will be approaching complete self - shielding at these high column densities . in short , the observed scatter in ti / h is most likely to represent true variations in the gas - phase abundance , not systematic effects .",
    "such intrinsic scatter may be expected due to the dynamic nature of the ism as dust is formed and ablated and the gas phase responds to photoionization and even incorporation into molecules .",
    "steigman et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have also argued that some amount of infalling gas that is not well mixed can not be ruled out .",
    "this will also contribute to intrinsic scatter in abundances .",
    "we present 12 new measurements of ti / h for local galactic sightlines for which d / h measurements exist , almost tripling the sample from prochaska et al .",
    "we investigate elemental abundance trends in the context of depletion of d onto grains as the cause for the large variation seen in d / h in the local galactic disk ( e.g. wood et al .",
    "2004 and references therein ) .",
    "our data support the tentative correlation between ti / h and d / h found by prochaska et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , showing a correlation at 97% significance . however , it is not clear that this correlation can be explained by a simple depletion model .",
    "this conclusion is based on 1 ) the much shallower dependence of ti / h on d / h than si or fe , despite the fact that the former is much more refractory and 2 ) the lack of a steep correlation between [ ti / h ] and .",
    "if the variation in ti abundances of our sample sightlines were dominated by varying dust depletion , we would expect a very steep correlation with , as has been previously found ( gondhalekar 1985 ; jenkins 2004 ) .",
    "moreover , the correlation of si / h versus d / h is steeper than between fe / h and d / h , contrary to what is expected if these relations trace depletion , since fe is more refractory than si .",
    "this may mean that whatever effect is causing the flattening of the ti depletion correlations that are normally seen in the ism at large , may also affect fe and si , although probably to a lesser degree .",
    "however , the complex and dynamic nature of the ism and dust depletion no doubt complicates the above simplistic expectations .",
    "nonetheless , the shallow abundance correlations exhibited by titanium are somewhat surprising given previous ism studies , and it is unclear why the depletion correlations have broken down in this sample",
    ". it may be due to superposition of the local bubble components whose physical environment could be quite different from the predominantly neutral disk ism .",
    "however , only using stars at distances @xmath31 400 pc does not change our results and many stars in the jenkins ( 2004 ) sample are at distances less than 500 pc .",
    "finally , we have also argued that the gradients of [ si / h ] , [ fe / h ] and [ ti / h ] vs. d / h do not support a simple model of infall of metal - poor gas with solar abundances as the dominant cause of local d variations .    in summary , whilst the depletion of d onto grains remains a plausible explanation for the variation in d / h in the local ism ,",
    "our results show that this interpretation is far from clear cut .",

    "<S> the currently favoured explanation for these large variations is that d is differentially depleted relative to h in some parts of the local interstellar medium ( ism ) . here , we test this scenario by studying the correlation between d / h and the abundance of titanium , one of the most refractory elements readily observed in the ism . </S>",
    "<S> previous work by prochaska , tripp & howk ( 2005 ) found tentative evidence for a correlation between ti / h and d / h based on seven sightlines . </S>",
    "<S> here we almost triple the number of previous ti measurements and include several sightlines with very high or low d / h that are critical for quantifying any correlations with d / h . with our larger sample , </S>",
    "<S> we confirm a correlation between ti / h and d / h at the 97% confidence level . </S>",
    "<S> however , the magnitude of this dependence is difficult to reconcile with a simple model of dust depletion for two reasons . </S>",
    "<S> first , contrary to what is expected from local depletion rates , the gradient of the highly refractory ti is much shallower than that observed for fe and si . </S>",
    "<S> second , we do not observe the established tight , steep correlation between [ ti / h ] and the mean volume density of hydrogen . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , whilst dust remains a plausible explanation for the local d / h variations , the abundances of at least some of the refractory elements do not provide unanimous support for this scenario . </S>",
    "<S> we also argue that the correlations of [ si / h ] , [ fe / h ] , and [ ti / h ] with d / h are inconsistent with a simple infall model of low metallicity gas with approximately solar abundances as the dominant cause for d variations .    </S>",
