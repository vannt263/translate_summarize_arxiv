    "the relatively bright x  ray source 1rxsj170849.0400910  was originally discovered in the _ rosat _  all sky survey ( rass , voges et al .",
    "1998 ) , but it did not attract much attention until @xmath011s periodic pulsations were found during an asca observation that was part of the galactic plane survey project ( sugizaki et al .",
    "based on the spin period value and the soft x ",
    "ray spectrum sugizaki et al . (",
    "1997 ) suggested that this optically unidentified source could be a new member of the small group of axps .",
    "axps are a group of x  ray pulsars ( mereghetti & stella 1995 ; van paradijs et al .",
    "1995 ) that share several peculiar properties : a narrow interval of pulse periods ( 612 s ) , very soft x  ray spectra ( a steep power  law with",
    "photon index @xmath0 34 often coupled to an additional blackbody  like component with kt@xmath0 0.40.6 kev ) , lower x  ray luminosities ( @xmath410@xmath5 erg s@xmath3 ) than those of persistent high mass x ",
    "ray binaries ( hmxbs ) , a narrow spatial distribution in the galactic plane , absence of large flux variations on timescales from months to years , spin  down trends at relatively stable rates ( 2100 @xmath1 10@xmath6 s yr@xmath3 ) , and absence of massive companion stars ( see mereghetti et al .",
    "1998 for a recent review ) . whether axps are isolated neutron stars or members of binary systems",
    "remains to be determined ; similarly it is unclear whether they are powered by accretion or by magnetic energy , as recently suggested by the analogy with soft @xmath7ray repeaters ( sgrs ; kouveliotou et al .",
    "1998 , mereghetti 1999 ) .",
    "in this letter we report on the data analysis of public _ rosat _",
    "hri observations of 1rxsj170849.0400910   and on a study of its possible optical counterparts .",
    "our results strongly support the suggestion that 1rxsj170849.0400910  is a member of the axp group .",
    "the field of 1rxsj170849.0400910  was observed twice by the _ rosat",
    "_  high resolution imager ( 0.12.4 kev ) : on 1994 march 8 ( ror 900595 ) for a total exposure time of 1120s and on 1997 march 2426 ( ror 180188 ) for a total exposure time of 11175s .",
    "the source was detected at a level of 0.13@xmath80.01 and 0.130@xmath80.003 counts s@xmath3 in the 1994 and 1997 observations , respectively ( 90% uncertainties are used through out this letter ) .",
    "we analyzed the two hri images using both a sliding cell and a wavelet transform  based detection algorithm ( lazzati et al .",
    "1999 ; campana et al .",
    "1999 ) . in the longer observation ( 1997 )",
    "the source was detected at r.a.=17@xmath908@xmath1047@xmath11.24 and dec=40@xmath120850.7 ( j2000 ) , with a statistical error of only 0.15  ( 1@xmath13 ) .",
    "however , due to the the uncertainty in the satellite boresight , an overall error radius of @xmath0 10   must be considered .",
    "the new position is located some 35  and 25  north of the asca position ( 30  radius ; sugizaki et al .",
    "1997 ) and pspc rass position ( 9  uncertainty ) .",
    "the 1993 _ rosat _  hri observation was analyzed in the same way and provided a slightly different ( but consistent ) position , r.a.=17@xmath908@xmath1046@xmath11.52 and dec=40@xmath120852.5 ( j2000 ; @xmath0 10  radius uncertainty ; see also fig .",
    "the _ rosat _  hri has no intrinsic spectral resolution , therefore in order to obtain the source flux from the observed count rate we assumed the spectral model derived with asca ( sugizaki et al .",
    "1997 ) , i.e. a power  law with photon index @xmath14=3.45 and n@xmath15=1.8@xmath110@xmath16 @xmath17 . in this way we determined a flux at the earth of 1.1@xmath110@xmath18 erg @xmath17 s@xmath3 in the 0.12.4 kev energy range . for a distance of 10 kpc",
    ", this corresponds to a source unabsorbed luminosity of @xmath19 1.2 @xmath1 10@xmath20 erg s@xmath3 in the 0.810 kev range .",
    "the event list of 1rxsj170849.0400910  was extracted from a circle of @xmath040  radius ( corresponding to an encircled energy of @xmath090% ) around the x  ray position of the 1997 observation .",
    "the photon arrival times were corrected to the barycentre of the solar system and a background subtracted light curve was accumulated in 1s bins .",
    "a power spectrum was calculated over the entire observation duration . a highly significant peak ( @xmath0 8@xmath13 )",
    "was found at a frequency of 0.09092712 hz , corresponding to a period of 10.998s . to refine the period determination and",
    "reduce its uncertainty we adopted a phase fitting technique .",
    "the best pulse period was determined to be p=10.99802@xmath80.00005 s. the shape of the modulation is somewhat asymmetric with a pulsed fraction of @xmath038@xmath84% ( fig.1 ) .",
    "we note that such pulse shape is similar to that reported by sugizaki et al . in the 0.82 kev range ( 1997 ;",
    "see their fig.3 ) .",
    "owing to poor statistics the periodicity was not detected during the 1994 observation ( assuming a 3@xmath13 detection threshold ) .            by comparing our period value with the one measured with asca on 1996 september 3 ( sugizaki et al .",
    "1997 ) a period derivative p = ( 7@xmath82)@xmath110@xmath2 s yr@xmath3 was inferred .",
    "photometry for each stellar object in the images was derived by means of daophotii ( stetson 1987 ) , and a color  magnitude diagram ( cmd ) was then computed ( see fig.2 ) for all stars within a region of 4@xmath15  around the x  ray position of 1rxsj170849.0400910 . for comparison fig.2 also shows the main sequence for two representative distances : 700pc ( with a@xmath21=1.6 ) and 3kpc ( a@xmath21=6.2 ) .",
    "note that 1rxsj170849.0400910  is located in the galactic plane ( l@xmath22=346.48 , b@xmath22=0.03 ) and that along this direction spiral arms are located at a distance of @xmath01kpc , @xmath0 3kpc and @xmath04.5kpc ( taylor & cordes 1993 ) .",
    "the r image of the field of 1rxsj170849.0400910  is shown in fig.3 .",
    "the new x  ray position uncertainty regions obtained with the two hri observations are shown ( 10@xmath23 radius ) .",
    "table1 gives the positions , r magnitudes and the colors of the objects within ( or close to ) the error circles .",
    "the spectrum of the brightest object within the error circle ( candidate a , r = 13.4 ; v ",
    "r = 1.48 ) is shown in fig.4 .",
    "the object was classified as a b0v spectral  type star with an absorption a@xmath246.2 .",
    "we found no evidence for any emission ",
    "lines in its spectrum .",
    "the great majority of accreting x  ray pulsars are found in two distinct classes of massive binaries : systems with ob type supergiant companions and systems with be stars .",
    "the latter are often characterized by transient activity .",
    "we found that star a , the brightest candidate counterpart in the new error circles , is a main sequence b0 star , but the properties of its spectrum make an association with 1rxsj170849.0400910  very unlikely .",
    "the absence of emission  lines corresponding to the balmer series , hei and feii strongly suggest that stara is not in a binary system with a compact object .",
    "although the optical emission  lines in be / neutron star systems may occasionally disappear during the quiescence state , such a behaviour has been so far observed only in transient sources which show also outbursts and pronounced spin  up / down rate episodes .",
    "the low value of the inferred spin  down period derivative over a 6 month interval and the constant x  ray flux value over a timescale of 3 years ( see below ) rule against this possibility .",
    "furthermore , the soft x ",
    "ray spectrum of 1rxsj170849.0400910  is much softer than that observed in all x  ray pulsars with massive companions ( i.e. a hard power law with photon index @xmath01 that steepens only above the cut  off energy of @xmath01030 kev ) .",
    "all remaining candidates are fainter than r@xmath017 implying x  ray to optical flux ratios higher than those typically observed in high mass x ",
    "ray binaries .",
    "this is also indicated by their position in the cmd shown in fig .  2 : the objects in the error circles are too blue and too faint to be compatible with early type stars .",
    "note also that our images are deep enough to exclude very reddened and distant o and b stars .",
    "the absorption column density for 1rxsj170849.0400910   is @xmath25@xmath17 ( sugizaki et al . 1997 ) , corresponding to e(b  v ) @xmath26 ( bohlin et al . 1978 ) . applying the standard interstellar extinction law ( fitzpatrick 1998 )",
    "this translates to an absorption in the r band of a@xmath27 . a b0 star located at a distance of @xmath28kpc",
    "would be observed with a r magnitude @xmath29 and v ",
    "r @xmath30 , i.e. it should have been easily detected in our optical images .",
    "our optical data can not exclude that 1rxsj170849.0400910  is part of a low mass x ",
    "ray binary ( lmxb ) .",
    "the faint stars in the error box are all compatible with relatively late spectral  type stars . for example",
    "stari is consistent with a a57v at a distance of 3kpc , while starh is consistent with a late k or an early m at a distance of 700pc .",
    "however , none of these objects has the characteristic blue color generally observed in the counterparts of luminous lmxbs , in which the optical emission is dominated by the accretion disk ( van paradijs 1998 ) .",
    "the lack of a massive companion star and the inferred spin  down at a rate of @xmath07.5@xmath110@xmath2 s yr@xmath3 strongly support the inclusion of 1rxsj170849.0400910  in the group of axps , as was previously suggested by sugizaki et al .",
    "( 1997 ) based only on the soft x ",
    "ray spectrum and 11s period .",
    "1rxsj170849.0400910  was detected by the _",
    "hri at the same flux level in both the 1994 and 1997 observations .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "flux extrapolated to the 0.810 kev range ( 2.3@xmath110@xmath18 erg @xmath17 s@xmath3 ; for the power ",
    "law best fit ) is about a factor of 2 lower than that observed with asca ( 4.3@xmath110@xmath18 erg @xmath17 s@xmath3 ) .",
    "a soft blackbody component , accounting for 2050% of the total flux has been seen in the spectrum of three well studied axps ( 4u0142 + 61 ; white et al . 1996",
    "; israel et al . 1999 , 2e2259 + 587 ; corbet et al . 1995 ; parmar et al . 1998 , and 1e1048.15937 ; corbet & mihara 1997 ; oosterbroek et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the presence of a similar component in 1rxsj170849.0400910  was found compatible with the asca data ( although not formally required by the fit , sugizaki et al .",
    "1997 ) . assuming a double component spectral model for 1rxsj170849.0400910 , at least part of the flux difference between the asca and _ rosat",
    "_  observations might be ascribed to the more complex spectral slope than assumed .",
    "we conclude that the modest luminosity variations across observations spanning three years is another analogy of 1rxsj170849.0400910  with the axps class .",
    "1rxsj170849.0400910 , like other axps , displays also a remarkable stability of the pulsed fraction and pulse shape .",
    "one of the main problems in understanding the nature of axps is to establish whether they are isolated neutron stars or members of binary systems with very low mass companions .",
    "both deep optical and infrared searches for counterparts and searches for doppler orbital modulations in the pulse frequency can provide valuable information in this respect .",
    "in the best studied axps , the limits derived from such studies exclude most classes of companions stars , but helium stars with m@xmath31 and white dwarves ( mereghetti , israel & stella 1998 ; wilson et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the possibility that 1rxsj170849.0400910  has a white dwarf companion star is compatible with our optical observations : the expected r magnitude at a distance of 700pc would be @xmath32 21 , well below the limiting magnitude of our images .",
    "similar results apply to a helium main sequence star .",
    "we also note that although the absorption column inferred with the asca data would place 1rxsj170849.0400910  quite far from us ( 10 kpc ) , it is possible that part of the absorption be intrinsic .",
    "also the possibility that 1rxsj170849.0400910  is a `` magnetar '' , an isolated strongly magnetic neutron star , possibly related to soft @xmath7ray repeaters remains viable .",
    "more period measurements are clearly required to look for `` glitches '' as foreseen in the `` magnetar '' scenario . in conclusion , based on the x  ray and optical findings presented here",
    ", we confirm that 1rxsj170849.0400910  is a new member of the axps group .",
