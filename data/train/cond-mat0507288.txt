    "optical lattices have become a powerful tool to enhance the effects of interaction in ultracold atomic systems to create strong correlations and probe many - body physics beyond the mean - field theory @xcite . simply through varying the depth of the lattice potential ,",
    "one changes the tunneling rate as well as the on - site interaction energy by changing the confinement of the atoms .",
    "the strength of the atomic interaction can be directly tuned with a magnetic feshbach resonance @xcite . in comparison to @xmath7rb , which has been used in almost all experiments on optical lattices , @xmath0na has stronger and wider feshbach resonances that are experimentally accessible @xcite .",
    "one such resonance has been used to produce quantum degenerate na@xmath5 molecules @xcite .",
    "therefore , a sodium condensate loaded into an optical lattice would be a rich and flexible system for studying strong correlations .",
    "so far , most optical lattice experiments have been performed with relatively heavy atomic species ( e.g. rubidium and potassium ) for which the recoil frequencies are lower and lasers are readily available to achieve trap depths of several tens of recoil frequencies at a few tens of milliwatts . for @xmath0na , high power single - mode lasers are necessary for similar experiments . in this work",
    ", we chose to use a dye laser red - detuned by @xmath1 nanometers from the d lines of sodium ( 589  nm ) .",
    "the spontaneous scattering rate limited the time window of the experiment to less than 50  ms , but was still sufficient to satisfy the adiabaticity condition to explore the quantum phase transition from a superfluid to a mott insulator .",
    "we also observed strong atom losses at various lattice laser detunings , which were interpreted as photoassociation transitions .",
    "the particular molecular states responsible for these transitions were identified through theoretical calculations and previous experimental data .",
    "a @xmath0na bose - einstein condensate containing up to @xmath8 atoms in the @xmath9 state was first produced in a magnetic trap and subsequently loaded into a crossed optical dipole trap .",
    "the optical trap was derived from a single - mode 1064  nm infrared laser , with the horizontal and vertical beams detuned by 60  mhz through acousto - optic modulators .",
    "the number of condensed atoms was varied through three - body decay in a tight trap ( @xmath10  hz ) , after which the trap was decompressed ( @xmath11  hz ) to allow further evaporation and re - thermalization . a vertical magnetic field gradient was applied to compensate for gravity and avoid sagging in the weaker trap .",
    "a dye laser operated at 594.710  nm was used to set up a three dimensional optical lattice .",
    "the three beams were focused to @xmath12-waist of @xmath13  @xmath14 m at the condensate , and retro - reflected to form standing waves .",
    "the two horizontal beams were orthogonal to each other , while the third beam was slanted at @xmath15 with respect to the vertical axis due to limited optical access .",
    "the three beams were frequency - shifted by @xmath16  mhz and 80  mhz to eliminate cross interference between different beams .",
    "the gaussian profile of the lattice beams added an additional harmonic trapping potential , while the localization of atoms at the lattice sites increased the repulsive mean field interaction . at the maximum lattice depth , the trap frequencies due to the combined potentials of the optical dipole trap and the lattice beams were @xmath17  hz for all three dimensions .",
    "the trap parameters were chosen such that during the ramping of the optical lattice potential , the overall size of the cloud ( parametrized by thomas - fermi radii ) remained approximately constant in order to minimize intra - band excitations ( the mean thomas - fermi radius is @xmath18 m for @xmath8 atoms ) .",
    "the peak per - lattice - site occupancy numbers achieved in our experiment were between 3 to 5 .",
    "atoms held in a shallow optical lattice can tunnel freely from site to site and form a superfluid phase . as the lattice is made deeper , the atomic interaction is increased while the tunneling rate between lattice sites is exponentially suppressed .",
    "the system then undergoes a phase transition to an insulating phase  the mott - insulator  in which each lattice site contains a definite fixed number of atoms . according to the mean - field theory for the homogenous systems of atoms in the lowest band of an optical lattice , the critical point for the phase transition from a superfluid to a mott - insulator state with @xmath19 atoms per lattice site",
    "is determined by @xcite : @xmath20 where : @xmath21 is the on - site interaction energy ; @xmath22 is the tunneling rate between adjacent lattice sites ; @xmath23 is the number of nearest neighbors in the lattice ( 6 for a cubic lattice ) ; @xmath24 is the atomic mass ; @xmath25 is the @xmath26-wave scattering length ( 2.75  nm for @xmath0na ) ) ; @xmath27 is the wannier function ; @xmath28 is the lattice wavelength ; @xmath29 is the lattice potential .",
    "figure  [ uandj ] shows @xmath30 and @xmath31 for a cubic lattice as a function of the lattice depth , obtained through a band - structure calculation .",
    "all energies are expressed in units of the recoil energy @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the lattice wavenumber . with this scaling @xmath34",
    "is independent of @xmath28 .",
    "the peak occupancy number in our experiment was @xmath35 . from fig .",
    "[ uandj ] , we find that the the critical points are at a lattice depth of 14.2 , 16.2 , 17.6 , 18.7 , and 19.5 ( all in units of @xmath36 ) for @xmath37 and 5 respectively .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ uandj ] shows that the ratio of @xmath38 increases rapidly with increasing lattice depth .    when a weak harmonic trap is present in addition to the lattice potential , as is the case for the experiment , the atomic density is not uniform",
    ". nevertheless , eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ]  [ eq3 ] ) can be used to estimate the lattice depth needed to observe the mott - insulator phase transition at any point in the harmonic trap .",
    "given the local density of the initial condensate , a local value of @xmath19 can be estimated and thus the local critical lattice depth can be read off from fig .",
    "[ uandj ] .",
    "since the critical depth increases with @xmath19 , one expects that as the lattice depth is increased , shells of different occupancies will undergo the transition to the mott - insulator phase starting from the edge of the density profile and moving in towards the center .",

    "the inset shows the ratio of @xmath30 over @xmath34 as a function of the lattice depth.,width=302 ]    in our experiment , the optical lattice was linearly ramped up to a maximum potential of @xmath40 in a variable time @xmath41 ( @xmath42  khz for our system ) .",
    "the lattice depth was calibrated by probing the energy difference between the first and the third band at zero quasi - momentum with small amplitude modulation of the lattice beams ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . after reaching the peak value ,",
    "the lattice was ramped back down again in @xmath41 .",
    "the ramp sequence was stopped at different times when both the trap and the lattice were suddenly switched off ( in @xmath43s ) .",
    "absorption images were then taken after some time - of - flight as shown in figure [ supmott ] .",
    "the disappearance of the interference pattern as the lattice depth was increased indicated the loss of phase coherence and a transition from the superfluid state to the mott insulator state @xcite .",
    "the subsequent revival of the interference patterns as the lattice depth was reduced ensured that the system remained essentially in the ground state during the ramping process .",
    "different @xmath41 s were used to check the adiabaticity condition .",
    "the peak spontaneous light scattering rate was about 21  s@xmath44 at the maximum intensity .",
    "therefore for @xmath45  ms , less than 20% of the atoms spontaneously scattered a photon .        after the lattice was fully ramped down , most of the atoms ( @xmath46 ) remained in the condensed fraction while the rest were heated and distributed across the first brillouin zone .",
    "based on the number of atoms that remained in the condensate after the lattice was fully ramped down , we conclude that @xmath47  ms satisfies the intra - band adiabaticity condition . in the following discussion",
    ", all measurements were performed for @xmath48  ms , but only the data for @xmath49  ms are shown as representative of similar results unless otherwise noted .    to characterize the lifetime of the mott - insulator phase , we held the lattice depth at the maximum level for various amounts of time before ramping the lattice down to @xmath50 ( below the mott - insulator transition point ) and taking the time - of - flight image . if the system remains in the ground state , the contrast of the interference pattern should be recovered , whereas additional heating populates the brillouin zone and reduces the interference contrast .",
    "a cross - section of the density profile was taken along the horizontal direction showing the interference peaks on top of a broad background ( see figure [ lifetime ] ) .",
    "the 5 interference peaks and the broad background were fit by 6 gaussians .",
    "the ratio between the total integrated area of the peaks and the background was used as the contrast to quantify the heating of the system .",
    "the contrast gives a more sensitive measure of the heating compared to simply counting the recovered condensate atoms .",
    "as the atoms in the interference peaks quickly move apart , they are not as broadened by the mean - field expansion as a single condensate .",
    "we performed the same measurement for two different peak occupancy numbers @xmath51 and 5 .",
    "figure [ lifetime ] shows the decay of the contrast and the lifetime @xmath52 was determined using an exponential fit .",
    "the fitting error on the lifetime was less than 17% .",
    "the lifetime was about 50% longer for @xmath53 , implying that inelastic collision processes significantly contributed to the heating of the system .",
    "the three - body decay rate at the maximum lattice potential for the peak on - site atomic density ( @xmath54  @xmath55 for @xmath56 ) is about 100  s@xmath44 @xcite , consistent with the observed lifetimes of @xmath57  ms .",
    "the peak density of a condensate in a harmonic trap and therefore the peak occupancy number scales with @xmath58 power of the total number of atoms , and our method for varying the number of atoms ( through three body decay ) was unable to consistently produce low enough atom numbers for peak occupancy @xmath59 .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of our current imaging system also became marginal for such low atom numbers .",
    "in this experiment , in addition to losses due to three body recombination , we observed large losses of atoms for certain specific tunings of the lattice laser in the range 592  nm to 595  nm .",
    "a sample of such a loss feature is shown in fig .",
    "[ photoassoc ] . for this measurement ,",
    "the same ramp sequence was used as before with @xmath60  ms .",
    "the peak intensity is about 280  w/@xmath61 in each lattice beam . due to the intentional frequency shifts between the three lattice beams the effective bandwidth of the lattice light as seen by the atoms",
    "is @xmath62  mhz . for the narrow frequency scan range of fig .",
    "[ photoassoc ] , the relative frequency scale was determined to better than 25  mhz using a fabry - perot cavity with a 2  ghz free spectral range .",
    "axis corresponds to a laser wavelength of 594.490 nm as determined with a wavemeter with accuracy @xmath63 ghz .",
    "the error bars are one standard deviation uncertainty .",
    "the line is only a guide and does not have a theoretical underpinning.,width=302 ]    single - photon photoassociations proved to have caused these losses .",
    "the lattice laser is tuned by @xmath64 cm@xmath44 to the red of the atomic @xmath2s@xmath3p@xmath66 transition and thus is in a spectral region where it might drive photoassociation transitions @xcite to rovibrational levels in molecular states dissociating to either the @xmath2s@xmath67p@xmath4 or @xmath2s@xmath67p@xmath66 limits .",
    "such a photoassociation transition , followed by the spontaneous radiative decay of the excited molecule into either a bound ground electronic - state molecule or into `` hot '' atoms , results in significant losses of atoms from the lattice .",
    "it is therefore important to identify the locations and strengths of these resonances and choose the appropriate lattice wavelength to avoid such losses .",
    "there is an extensive body of knowledge on the photoassociation of ultracold alkali - metal atoms and the behavior of the molecular potentials dissociating to the @xmath2s@xmath67p@xmath4 or @xmath2s@xmath67p@xmath66 limits @xcite .",
    "figure [ pots ] shows the relevant excited molecular potentials as a function of internuclear separation @xmath68 .",
    "the ground electronic states of na@xmath5 are the x@xmath69 and a@xmath70 states and two colliding ground state atoms will be some mixture of these symmetries . to the extent that the excited states are well described as @xmath71 or @xmath72 states , the @xmath73 and @xmath74 selection rules",

    "since the primary goal of the present work was to avoid photoassociation losses we did not investigate known a - state locations further .",
    "our search focused on the strong resonances due to the ( 1)@xmath76 state which had not been previously observed in this spectral region . in 0.5  ghz steps , we scanned through a 30  ghz range around the theoretically predicted locations based on the model and auxiliary experimental data discussed below . in all but one such scans",

    "their spacing , however , should be equal to that of the @xmath84 levels and our observations are not consistent with such spacings .",
    "the potential curves used in the calculation of the ( 1)@xmath76 vibrational levels were generated from an extended version of the model developed by movre and pichler for calculating the combined effects of the @xmath85 resonant dipole interaction and the atomic spin - orbit interaction .",
