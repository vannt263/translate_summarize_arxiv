    "[ sec : intro ]    motivated by the recent discovery of many ultra - luminous supernovae ( ulsn ) , including , controversially , the extreme case of asassn-15lh @xcite , the limits of several scenarios often invoked for their interpretation are considered .",
    "these include colliding shells , pair - instability supernovae , and newly - born magnetars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "each of these energy sources will give different results when occurring in a stripped core of helium or carbon and oxygen ( type i ) or a supergiant ( type ii ) , and both cases are considered .",
    "all calculations of explosions and light curves use the 1d implicit hydrodynamics code ` kepler ` @xcite , and employ presupernova models that have been published previously .",
    "the more extreme case of `` relativistic supernovae '' - either supernovae with relativistic jets or the explosion of super - massive stars that collapse because of general relativistic instability @xcite is not considered here .",
    "these are rare events with their own distinguishing characteristics .",
    "[ sec : prompt ]    any explosive energy that deposits before the ejecta significantly expands will suffer severe adiabatic degradation that will prevent the supernova from being particularly bright .",
    "an upper bound for prompt energy deposition in a purely neutrino - powered explosion is @xmath7 @xcite , which is capable of explaining common supernovae @xcite , but not the more luminous ones . in a red , or worse , blue supergiant ,",
    "the expansion from an initial stellar radius of , at most , 10@xmath8 cm , to a few times @xmath9 cm , where recombination occurs , degrades the total electromagnetic energy available to @xmath10 . even in the most extreme hypothetical case , where a substantial fraction of a neutron star binding energy , @xmath11 erg , deposits instantly",
    ", the light curve is limited to a peak brightness of approximately @xmath12 ( neglecting the very brief phase of shock break out ) .",
    "this can be demonstrated analytically and numerically . adopting the expression for plateau luminosity and duration from @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "as calibrated to numerical models by @xcite , type ii supernovae have a luminosity on their plateaus of @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the progenitor radius in 500 @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the envelope mass in 10 @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the prompt explosion energy in units of 10@xmath19 erg",
    ". the approximate duration of the plateau , ignoring the effects of radioactivity , is given by @xmath20 this plateau duration is significantly shorter than common supernovae due to the much higher energies considered .",
    "these relations compare favorably with a model for a 15 @xmath17  explosion calculated with an assumed explosion energy of @xmath21 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rsg_pist ] ) . here",
    "the red supergiant presupernova stellar model from @xcite had a radius of 830 @xmath15  and an envelope mass , 8.5 @xmath17 .",
    "the estimated luminosity on the plateau from eq .",

    "the total energy emitted is approximately @xmath25 , or @xmath26 erg .",
    "supergiant exploded with two different values of prompt energy deposition .",
    "one with @xmath27 erg , is typical of common type iip supernovae ; the other with @xmath28 erg is near the upper bound of what any prompt , point explosion might provide . even for this extreme case",
    ", the plateau luminosity does not exceed @xmath29 .",
    "the curves are dashed when the ejecta become optically thin and the blackbody representation of their emission becomes questionable .",
    "the presupernova star , originally 15 @xmath17  at birth , had a mass of 12.6 @xmath17 , of which 8.5 @xmath17  was in the hydrogen envelope , and a radius of @xmath30 .",
    "the luminosity at shock break out in the more energetic model peaked at @xmath31 , but only lasted for about 100 seconds .",
    "[ fig : rsg_pist ] ]    similar limits apply to pair - instability supernovae ( pisn ) in red supergiant progenitors . again",

    "( [ eq : tauplat ] ) imply plateau luminosities near @xmath36 for about 200 days .",
    "these values are consistent with the ` kepler ` models given in @xcite .",
    "the total radiated energy is @xmath37 erg .",
    "most of the radioactivity decays during the plateau .",
    "since the decay energy is substantially less than the explosion energy , the modification of the light curve during its bright plateau is not appreciable .",
    "we conclude that ulsn must be energized by a power source that deposits its energy well after the original explosion .",
    "the known delayed energy sources are radioactivity , colliding winds , and pulsars .",
    "the most prolific sources of @xmath38ni are pisn . the rarest , most massive pisn produces , at most , 50 @xmath17  of @xmath38ni in an explosion with a final kinetic energy of @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "this large production only occurs for the the most massive helium cores ( @xmath40130 @xmath17 ) , which very nearly collapse to black holes .",
    "the total energy available from the decay of large amount of @xmath38ni is substantial , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the @xmath38ni mass in @xmath17 , and @xmath43 d and @xmath44 d are mean lives of @xmath38co and @xmath38ni . for a nickel mass of @xmath4050 @xmath17",
    "the total energy is nearly @xmath45 erg .",
    "most of this energy is lost during the adiabatic expansion to peak , however .    for a star that has lost its hydrogen envelope , an approximate estimate when the pisn light curve peaks is given by equating the effective diffusion timescale , @xmath46 , to age .",
    "this gives a time of peak luminosity , @xmath47 , of @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the ejecta mass in @xmath17  and @xmath50 is the explosion energy in erg .",
    "considering the similarity of high velocity and iron - rich composition to type ia supernovae , an opacity @xmath51 is assumed .",
    "arnett s rule @xcite then implies a maximum luminosity of @xmath52 only the luminosity due to the decay of @xmath38co is included here , since for t @xmath53 , most of @xmath38ni will have already decayed . for the fiducial values of @xmath47 and @xmath42 , the peak luminosity is then roughly @xmath54 , which compares favourably with models in which the hydrodynamics and radiation transport are treated carefully @xcite and with the analytic models of @xcite .    assuming that the total emitted energy by a type i supernova is @xmath55 and using the fiducial values , the approximate upper bound on the total luminous energy in a pisn - type i is @xmath56 erg , about one quarter of the total decay energy .",
    "[ sec : shells ]      [ sec : generic ]    observations show that a substantial fraction of ulsn , especially those of type iin , are brightened by circumstellar interaction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in some cases",
    "this interaction can be extremely luminous @xcite .",
    "the necessary mass loss is often attributed to prior outbursts of the star as a luminous blue variable ( lbv ; e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or a pulsational - pair - instability supernova ( ppisn , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though other possibilities , e.g. common envelope @xcite , are sometimes invoked .",
    "the luminosity of colliding shells is limited by their differential speeds , their masses , and the radii at which they collide .",
    "if the collision happens at too small a radius where the ejecta is still very optically thick , colliding shells become another variant of `` prompt explosions '' (   [ sec : prompt ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the collision happens at too large a radius , the resulting transient has a longer time scale , lower luminosity , and may not emit chiefly in the optical @xcite . in practice , these constraints limit the radius where the shells collide and produce a bright optical transient to roughly @xmath9 - 10@xmath57 cm . a similar range of radii is obtained by multiplying typical collision speeds , @xmath58 km s@xmath59 , by the duration of an ulsn , @xmath60 days .    @xcite give a maximal `` cooling luminosity '' for colliding shells in which most of the dissipated energy goes into light ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "1 ) , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the pre - explosive mass loss rate with speed @xmath63 , and @xmath64 is the shock speed of the explosive ejecta impacting that `` wind '' .",
    "narrow lines in the spectra of type iin supernovae , including some very luminous ones @xcite , imply pre - explosion wind speeds of a few hundred to 1000 km s@xmath59 . at those speeds , and given that the light curve is generated at @xmath65 , the relevant time for the mass loss is a few years before the final explosion .",
    "the velocity of the shock is @xmath66 , where e is the explosion energy of mass m. here we normalize it to 10@xmath67 cm s@xmath59 as in @xcite , though it implies a very energetic explosion .",
    "the luminosity from the collision is then @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the mass loss rate a few years before the explosion normalized to 0.1 @xmath17  per year , @xmath70 is in @xmath71 and @xmath72 is in units of @xmath73 .",
    "typical values for the outbursts that produce very bright bright type iin supernovae are @xmath69 = 1 , @xmath74 = 1 to 10 , and @xmath72 = 0.5 @xcite implying peak luminosities near @xmath75 erg s@xmath59 .",

    "it is the mass of the shell into which a supernova of given energy plows that matters most @xcite .",
    "we are unaware of any models other than ppisn (   [ sec : ppsn ] or 10 @xmath17  stars @xcite that eject solar masses of material just years before dying . if a generous upper limit of 10 @xmath17  between 10@xmath78 and 10@xmath57 cm ( @xmath79 = 1 ) is adopted , @xmath80 is @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the outer edge of the interaction region in 10@xmath57 cm units . for a shock speed @xmath83 and an event duration of 100 days , @xmath84 .",
    "the maximum luminosity is then @xmath85 .",
    "more generally the maximum luminosity is @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the duration of the brightest part of the light curve .",
    "this limit is sufficient to accommodate all ulsn that maybe powered by collisions and is consistent with the theoretical results of @xcite .",
    "it might be possible to raise this limit by invoking slightly greater shock speeds or shell masses .",
    "the former requires extremely energetic supernovae though .",
    "accelerating a shell of 10 @xmath17  to 10@xmath67 cm s@xmath59 requires an explosion energy of at least 10@xmath88 erg and 100% conversion efficiency .",
    "this is considerably more than neutrinos can provide and already indicates a source that is , at heart , rotationally powered .",
    "yet it may be that having high mass loss rates removes sufficient angular momentum to inhibit the formation of rapidly rotating iron cores .",
    "even energetic pisn do not develop speeds of 10,000 km s@xmath59 in a significant part of their mass .",
    "moreover , pisn are burning carbon radiatively in their centers the last few years of their life and , except for ppisn (   [ sec : ppsn ] ) , experience no obvious instability that would lead to the impulsive ejection of 10 @xmath17 .    with considerable uncertainty",
    ", we thus adopt an upper limit for colliding shells of @xmath89 and a total radiated energy of @xmath90 erg . for bare helium cores which are not ppisn and clearly not lbvs , the values are likely to be much smaller because of the smaller shell masses , but existing models , do not allow a specific estimate .      [",
    "sec : ppsn ]    the most luminous colliding shell models with definite predictions for their luminosity are ppisn @xcite . for a narrow range of masses corresponding to stars with 50 - 55 @xmath17  helium cores , a supergiant star , red or blue , will eject its hydrogen envelope at speeds @xmath91 km s@xmath59 , and a year or so later eject one or more very energetic shells that smash into it @xcite .",
    "the source of the energy is the thermonuclear burning of carbon and oxygen . for lighter helium cores ,",
    "low energy shells are ejected in rapid succession before the envelope has expanded to 10@xmath78 cm .",
    "the collision energy is adiabatically degraded and the resulting supernova is not especially luminous ( woosley 2016 , in prep . ) . for heavier cores ,",
    "the pulses are too infrequent and produce collisions outside of 10@xmath57 cm that last much longer than one hundred days .    in the narrow helium - core mass range of 50 - 55 @xmath17",
    "though , one or more pulses occurring a year or so after the one that ejects the envelope , eject additional shells carrying a energy of up to @xmath92 erg @xcite .",
    "radiating all this energy over a 10@xmath93 s interval gives a luminosity that can approach 10@xmath94 erg s@xmath59 @xcite .    for helium cores lacking any hydrogen envelope",
    "the luminosities are less because of the lack of a massive low velocity reservoir to turn kinetic energy into light .",
    "typical peak luminosities for type i ppisn are thus near @xmath95 erg s@xmath59 , and the light curve can be more highly structured @xcite .",
    "[ sec : magnetars ]    with some tuning , the energy deposited by a young magnetar in the ejecta of a supernova can significantly brighten its light curve @xcite .",
    "the model has been successfully applied to numerous observations of type ic ulsn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and magnetars seem a natural consequence of collapse of rapidly rotating cores ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the rotational kinetic energy of a magnetar with a period @xmath96 is approximately @xmath97 erg , where @xmath98 erg is the rotational energy for an initial period of @xmath400.7 ms .",
    "usually this period is restricted to @xmath99ms , because of rotational instabilities that lead to copious gravitational radiation .",
    "however , @xcite have recently discussed the possibility that the limiting rotational kinetic energy could exceed @xmath100 erg , depending on the neutron star mass and the equation of state and here we adopt that value as an upper bound . this energy reservoir can be tapped through vacuum dipole emission , which is approximately @xmath101 , where @xmath102 g is the dipole field strength at the equator , and @xmath103 s is the magnetar spin - down timescale .",
    "a magnetic dipole moment b(@xmath104km)@xmath105 is adopted , and an angle of @xmath106 between the magnetic and rotational axes has been assumed . combining these relations ,",
    "one obtains the temporal evolution of the rotational energy and magnetar luminosity as @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "the peak luminosity can be estimated using the diffusion equation and ignoring the radiative losses in the first law of thermodynamics @xcite : @xmath109 , { { \\label{eq : lpeak}}}\\ ] ] where @xmath110 is the ratio of spin - down to effective diffusion timescales .",
    "the term inside square brackets has a maximum at @xmath111 , obtained by solving @xmath112 .",
    "this implies an optimal field strength for maximizing the peak luminosity is : @xmath113 that is , for a given combination of @xmath114 and ejecta parameters - @xmath115 , the brightest possible peak luminosity is obtained for this field strength .",
    "the maximum peak luminosity is then @xmath116 . for the limiting initial",
    "spin of @xmath117 the corresponding field strength is @xmath118 g ( for @xmath119 , @xmath120 @xmath17  and @xmath121 ) , and the limiting peak luminosity is @xmath122 .",
    "here @xmath123 , therefore unless one invokes even lower @xmath124 , @xmath49 and much larger @xmath125 , any transient with brighter observed luminosity will be hard to explain by the magnetar model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lcs ] ) .    using a version of arnett s rule (",
    "* e.g. ) , @xmath126 , the time for @xmath127 is @xmath128 . for the maximal luminosity , the corresponding peak time is then @xmath129 .",
    "this can be used to estimate the limiting radiated energy in the same way as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : erad_type1 ] ) to find that : @xmath130 any observation with a total radiated energy of @xmath131 erg will be nearly impossible to explain by the magnetar model . a more conventional value and one that fits asassn-151h ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lcs ] ) , is @xmath132 erg .",
    "this is within a factor of two of the limiting magnetar kinetic energy inferred for gamma - ray bursts by @xcite .",
    "similar magnetars embedded in a less ejecta will give slightly brighter light curves .",
    "bottom : the same magnetar used in the top panel for fitting asassn-15lh is embedded in the ejecta of a massive red supergiant progenitor .",

    "the dashed curve marks the transition to nebular phase .",
    "[ fig : lcs ] ]    to illustrate these limits , a series of magnetar - powered models based upon exploding co cores ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was calculated to find a best fit to the light curve of asassn-15lh . in each case , soon after bounce , the magnetar deposited its energy in the inner ejecta at a rate given by the vacuum dipole spin - down rate .",

    "[ fig : lcs ] shows the best fitting model , which employs a magnetar with an initial period of 0.7 ms and magnetic field strength of @xmath133 g , illuminating the ejecta in the explosion of a 14 @xmath17  co core ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "these magnetar parameters agree well with the previously published fits , but the ejecta masses are different .",
    "an ejecta mass of 15 @xmath17  was obtained by @xcite , as they used simple semi - analytical models , which ignored all dynamical effects and deviate from hydrodynamic calculations most when @xmath135 .",
    "an ejecta mass of only 3 @xmath17  was used in @xcite , as they applied the same simple semi - analytical model for the early release of the data spanning only @xmath4060 days .",
    "that fit would not work for the later data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lcs ] , and the ejecta would become optically thin at an early time .",
    "@xcite limited their models to small he - cores ( 8 @xmath17 ) , and their model does not fit the broad peak of asassn-15lh well .",
    "magnetars can also illuminate bright , long lasting type ii supernovae .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : lcs ] , shows the same magnetar that was applied for the fit to asassn-15lh , now embedded inside the remnant of a 15 @xmath17  red supergiant progenitor .",
    "because the ejecta mass is much larger , the light curve is fainter and much broader .",
    "the ejecta stays optically thick for nearly 4 months .",
    "much as radioactive decay extends the plateau duration by causing ionization , magnetar - deposited energy also significantly extends the optically thick period .",

    "10@xmath94 erg s@xmath59 and peak integrated powers are near 10@xmath148 erg .",
    "this is gratifying since most `` superluminous supernovae '' are within those bounds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for point - like explosions , which includes pisn of type ii ,",
    "the prompt energy injection is typically degraded by a factor of @xmath149 by adiabatic expansion , so even obtaining 10@xmath148 erg of light requires an explosion that strains the limits of both neutron star binding energy ( core - collapse supernovae ) and thermonuclear energy ( pisn ) .",
    "the upper bound for pisn - type i is also well determined by both analytic scaling rues and numerical models .    for supernovae",
    "whose light comes from colliding shells , the constraints are less accurate due to lack of knowledge about the masses of the shells involved and the supernova explosion energies in cases where large impulsive mass loss occurs just before the star dies .",
    "the limit in the table assumes shock speeds less than 5000 km s@xmath59 and shell masses less than 10 @xmath17 .",
    "estimates for ppisn are more precise because the mass of the helium core needed to make luminous optical supernovae is highly constrained . in order that the duration of the pulses be years and not months or centuries ,",
    "the helium core mass need to be in the range 50 - 55 @xmath17  and that restricts the energy of the secondary pulses and supernova .",
    "magnetars are a special case .",
    "the limits come from using a simple dipole formula in a situation where it has not been observationally tested and assuming what some would regard as a high limiting rotational energy for neutron stars .",
    "rotation can tap an energy reservoir almost as great as the binding energy of the neutron star and deposit it over an arbitrarily long time scale - depending on the choice of magnetic field strength .",
    "thus the optical efficiency for converting rotational energy to light can be ( forced to be ) very high .",
    "it is interesting though that the upper bounds for magnetar - powered light curves are so high .",
    "this implies a possible observable diagnostic .",
    "supernovae that substantially exceed @xmath150 for an extended period and which have total luminous powers far above @xmath6 erg should be considered strong candidates for containing an embedded magnetar .",
