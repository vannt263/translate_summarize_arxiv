    "the particular system we consider in this paper is an example of a lorentz lattice gas ( llg ) . in a llg , a single particle moves along the bonds of a lattice , from lattice site to lattice site .",
    "when the particle arrives at a lattice site , it encounters a scatterer that modifies its motion according to a given scattering rule .",
    "the reason to study such systems is to understand the basic principles that underly dynamic processes such as diffusion , propagation , etc . @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", the study of a particle s motion on a lattice is a natural choice , since a lattice has both a discrete structure and a high degree of regularity . in such systems",
    "the type of scattering rules that have been investigated are physically motivated rules such as rotators , mirrors , etc . @xcite .    in the case",
    "that there is a scatterer at each lattice site and each scatterer is _ fixed _ ,",
    "i.e. is not affected by the particle s motion , the problem of determining the particle s motion through the lattice is related to problems in percolation theory @xcite .",
    "when the scatterers are _ not fixed _ , as is the case in this paper , and are affected by the particle , the particle s motion is a much more dynamic process and has connections to problems in kinetic theory @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we continue our investigation , begun in @xcite , of the particle s motion on the regular two - dimensional honeycomb lattice , in which the lattice is fully occupied by flipping scatterers .",
    "the particular type of scatterers we consider here are flipping rotators , which rotate the particle s velocity either to its left or its right by an angle of @xmath7 , depending on whether the scatterer is _ oriented _ to the left or the right , i.e. is a left or right scatterer , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the scatterers _ flip _ or change orientation after scattering the particle , flipping either from right to left or from left to right , depending on their original orientation , respectively .",
    "this flipping motion of the scatterers has a number of consequences .",
    "viewing the lattice and its scatterers as a medium through which the particle moves , the fact that the particle can change ( flip ) the scatterer s orientation implies that there is an interplay or interaction between the particle and the medium .",
    "that is , the particle affects the medium , which then in turn , has an effect on the particle s motion .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this type of system , which we consider in this paper , is likely one of the simplest systems in which there is an interaction between the particle and medium .",
    "having fixed a lattice and a scattering rule , it remains to choose an initial configuration of the scatterers , in order to study the properties of the motion of the particle over the lattice .",
    "the initial configuration we consider , throughout the majority of this paper , is the configuration in which each scatterer is a right rotator with probability @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "the orientation of each scatterer is chosen independent from the others , so that the collection of their initial orientations forms a set of independent identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "random variables . from a physical point of view",
    ", we interpret this as an assumption that the particle moves in a random medium .",
    "although the initial configuration is random , the particle s motion through the lattice is governed by _ deterministic _ scattering rules . in this",
    "setting , the particle s motion is referred to as a _",
    "deterministic walk in a random medium _ or environment @xcite .",
    "that is , the first time the particle visits a lattice site , it is scattered to its right by a right scatterer with probability @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "however , on each subsequent visit to this same site , the particle is scattered ( deterministically ) in the opposite direction , from which it was previously scattered , since the scatterer has flipped its orientation after each visit .",
    "we find that , as long as @xmath1 , the particle s motion will be periodic ( see theorem [ thm:2 ] ) . because the random initial configuration in this model initially causes the particle to move randomly , this means that , the deterministic nature of the particle s motion eventually overcomes this randomness .",
    "the reason this takes place is that , as the particle moves through the lattice , it creates a number of structures , which we refer to as reflecting structures .",
    "the initial effect of a reflecting structure on the particle is to cause the particle to reverse its trajectory back to its initial position .",
    "however , a second , and arguably more important effect of these structures , is to block the particle s progress through the lattice .",
    "we find that a number of reflecting structures , acting together , can permanently limit the particle s motion , causing its trajectory to become periodic ( see theorem [ thm:1 ] ) .",
    "thus , we refer to this particular type of periodic motion as _ self - limiting_.    reflecting structures and their effect on the particle s motion have been previously observed in both the square @xcite and the honeycomb lattice @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we can go further and describe the general topology of these structures .",
    "we also introduce two other structures and describe their topology and effect on the particle .",
    "these new structures are , respectively , called _ semi - reflecting structures _ and _ reflector transforms_.    we show that as the particle moves through the lattice , it can either create , transform , or annihilate a reflecting structure . in order to become trapped or _ limited _ by a number of reflecting structures , we show that the particle must go through the process of both creating as well as transforming these structures . however , to avoid becoming trapped",
    ", the particle can also annihilate those reflectors it has either created or transformed . in this sense ,",
    "the particle acts like an _ architect _ that can build , destroy , and remodel , i.e. _ transform _ , these structures .",
    "this competition between reflector formation , transformation , and annihilation , occurs for all @xmath2-values in the set @xmath8 .",
    "however , for @xmath9 the situation is very different .",
    "building on recent results @xcite , we show that for these two @xmath2-values , the particle can _ never _ create a reflecting structure ( see corollary [ cor:2 ] ) . additionally , we observe that the lack of reflecting structures , causes the particle to have a non - periodic and therefore unbounded trajectory @xcite . hence , as @xmath2 approaches 0 or 1 , i.e. as the random medium becomes increasingly homogenous , the particle undergoes a discontinuous dynamical transition from having a periodic , self - limiting motion to having a very different non - periodic behavior .    in the periodic , or self - limiting case ,",
    "the particle becomes trapped between the reflecting structures it creates .",
    "once the particle creates a reflecting structure , it will reverses its entire trajectory back to its initial position , going only through those lattice sites it has already visited .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath9 , the particle not only appears numerically to have an unbounded trajectory but , between returns to its initial position , the particle never visits any lattice site twice ( see theorem [ thm:1.1 ] ) .",
    "this self - avoiding motion is then vastly different from the periodic self - limiting motion observed for @xmath10 .    in what seems paradoxical , in a random medium ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath1 , the particle has a motion that is _ ordered _ in the sense that its trajectory is periodic and therefore regularly repeats itself . on the other hand , when @xmath9 and the medium is homogeneous , and therefore much more _ ordered _",
    ", the particle s motion is much more _ irregular _ exhibiting features of deterministic chaos and of self - organized criticality @xcite .    to more fully understand how and why reflecting as well as",
    "semi - reflecting structures appear in different random media , i.e. for different @xmath1 , we will also consider a generalization of our flipping rotator model , in which the scatterer s initial configurations are not identically distributed . in that setting",
    "we find , under mild conditions , that the particle will still create a number of reflecting structures , which will cause its motion to be periodic ( see corollary [ cor:4 ] ) .",
    "in contrast to this we show , that if there are correlations between the scatterer s initial orientations , i.e. these orientations are not independent , then this can have a noticeable impact on the particle s motion .",
    "specifically , we show that it is possible to have a random configuration with the same distribution as in our original model in this paper , but with _ local _ correlations between scatters .",
    "interestingly , these local correlations have a global effect on the particle s dynamics , causing it to shift from being periodic to having an unbounded motion ( see @xcite ) . as one might expect ,",
    "although the particle s motion is based on a deterministic rule , its dynamics is also very much dependent on the specific statistical properties of the model s initial configuration .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we introduce the basic model , we will consider throughout the majority of the paper . in section [ sec:3 ]",
    "we describe the type of structures the particle can create and annihilate , as it moves through the lattice .",
    "we show how these two processes can interact , in such a way , as to cause the particle to have a periodic motion . based on these processes ,",
    "we show in section [ sec:4 ] that , for @xmath1 , the particle in the model we consider will have a periodic trajectory with probability 1 .    in section [ sec:5 ]",
    "we describe the particle s trajectory for @xmath9 , where the medium is initially homogenous and the particle has an unbounded and self - avoiding type of motion , as is considered in @xcite .",
    "we then investigate the transition between the particle s self - limiting and self - avoiding motion , as @xmath2 approaches 0 and 1 . in section [ sec:6 ] we study the case in which the model s initial configuration of scatterers is non - identically distributed , where we find that , under mild conditions , the particle still has a self - limiting motion . in section [ sec:7 ]",
    "we introduce other random configurations , in which the scatterers are not independently chosen , to show the effect of local ( short range ) correlations between initial orientations .",
    "we show this can lead to non - periodic dynamics .",
    "some final comments , including a number of open question , are given in section [ sec:8 ] .",
    "we note that although the main results of this paper are proven rigorously , the paper is written so that it can be followed without the need for the reader to work through the various proofs , since the main ideas and techniques used to prove the results in this paper , are described in words , prior to each result .",

    "the lattice , over which the particle moves , is the honeycomb lattice @xmath13 , with _ sites _ @xmath14 and _ bonds _ @xmath15 .",
    "this lattice consists of regular hexagons , with sides of unit length , so that each lattice site has three nearest neighbors with which it shares a lattice bond of length 1 ( see figure [ fig:1 ] ) .",

    "for instance , on the triangular lattice it has been shown that , for any initial configuration of scatterers on the lattice , the particle will always propagate in a strip away from its initial position @xcite . on the square lattice , in which every lattice site is occupied by a scatterer , it has been shown that the particle will have an unbounded non - periodic trajectory irrespective of the initial configuration of scatterers @xcite .    before finishing this section",
    ", it should be noted that the @xmath45 model does not have a random initial configuration for all @xmath2-values .",

    "to describe the difference between the particle s motion in the @xmath45 model for @xmath1 and @xmath9 , we need the following theorem , found in @xcite ( theorem 3.2 ) .",
    "this theorem states that the particle s trajectory in the @xmath48 model for @xmath9 , can be described in terms of cycles .",

    "hence , the particle can never encounter a reflecting structure in the @xmath45 model , if @xmath9 .",
    "based on corollary [ cor:2 ] , no reflecting structures are possible in @xmath45 for @xmath9 . for @xmath1 ,",
    "what we observe numerically is that , the particle s trajectory in the @xmath45 model only becomes periodic after encountering a number of reflecting structures .",
    "this leads us to conjecture that the probability of ever encountering a reflecting structure is in fact equal to @xmath286 for @xmath1 .",
    "this is in contrast to what we observe in these numerical simulations for @xmath9 , where the particle s trajectory appears to be unbounded and therefore non - periodic ( cf .",

    "then the concentration of scatterers that are initially oriented to the left is @xmath287 , which is then slightly greater than 0 .",
    "since the particle in the @xmath45 model and the @xmath281 model have the same trajectory only until the particle in the @xmath45 model encounters a left scatterer then , over short time intervals , these two models have the same dynamics , with a high probability .",
    "consequently , the particle s transient , or short term dynamics in the @xmath45 model , for @xmath2 close to 1 , consists , with a high probability , of a number of self - avoiding cycles , since the particle s dynamics in the @xmath288 model consist entirely of self - avoiding cycles . as @xmath2 approaches 1 , the number of self - avoiding cycles increases as the particle s trajectory in the @xmath45 and the @xmath281 model become more similar until , in the limit , the particle s entire trajectory can be decomposed into a sequence of these cycles .",
    "it is in this manner then that the particle makes a transition from the periodic self - limiting motion , described in theorem [ thm:2 ] , to the self - avoiding motion described in theorem [ thm:1.1 ] .",
    "moreover , by symmetry , the same holds as @xmath2 approaches 0 .    as a final remark",

    "hence , the particle in this model will have a self - avoiding motion ( see theorem [ lem:1 ] ) .",
    "because of this , the particle will never encounter a reflecting structure since , in order to form a reflector , the particle has to cross its own path away from its initial position .",
    "this is impossible , if the particle s motion is self - avoiding .",

    "a realization of the particle s trajectory in the @xmath344 model is shown in figure [ fig:7.1](a ) for @xmath345 .",

    "the major difference between the @xmath45 model and the @xmath319 model is that , in the latter , the scatterers on each hexagon @xmath343 are _ not _ independently chosen to be either right or left scatterers , but are chosen to be either all left scatterers or all right scatterers . despite this difference , the initial configurations of scatterers in both these models are identically distributed and , in fact , these distributions are the same , i.e. in both models @xmath347=p$ ] for any @xmath26 .",
    "additionally , we have that @xmath348 for @xmath9 . therefore , the only difference between these two models are the local correlations found in the initial scattering configuration of the @xmath319 model .",
    "what we observe in the @xmath319 model , via numerical experiments , is that the absence of reflecting structures leads to a lack of periodicity in the particle s motion .",
    "this can be seen in figure [ fig:7.1](b ) , where the particles s mean square displacement is plotted for @xmath264 in both the @xmath319 and the @xmath45 models . the particle s _ mean square displacement _ is given by : @xmath349 where @xmath84 denotes the particle s position in the @xmath45 model and @xmath350 denotes the particle s position in the @xmath319 model .",
    "the average @xmath351 is taken over all realizations of the random initial condition @xmath39 , in each respective model .",
    "the norm @xmath352 is the standard euclidean distance in the plane .",
    "cc    avoid.pdf ( 48,-7)@xmath353    &    corrplot.pdf ( 65,17)@xmath354 ( 45,37)@xmath355 ( 48,-5)@xmath338    in figure [ fig:7.1](b ) , we see that the particle s mean square displacement @xmath354 in the @xmath356 model asymptotically approaches the value @xmath357 as a consequence of the particle s periodic motion .",
    "physically , the value @xmath358 is the average distance the particle is away from its initial position during one period of its motion , in the @xmath356 model . in contrast , the particle s mean square displacement @xmath355 in the @xmath344 model , can be numerically approximated by the function @xmath359 , which suggests that the particle in this model has an unbounded trajectory .",
    "thus , by introducing local correlations into the initial configuration of the @xmath45 model , it is possible to drastically change the particle s motion from being periodic to what numerically appears to be a non - periodic super - diffusive motion for @xmath264 ( see figure [ fig:7.1](b ) ) .",
    "this may seem somewhat surprising , since the correlations found in the @xmath319 model s initial configuration are _ local _ , in that only scatterers on the same hexagon can be correlated .",
    "yet , these correlations are sufficient to change the _ global _ properties of the particle s dynamics .",
    "in this paper we have considered the deterministic motion of a particle moving on the honeycomb lattice @xmath16 , whose sites are randomly occupied by left and right flipping rotators . when each individual scatterer is initially oriented to the right , independent of the other scatterers with probability @xmath1",
    ", we show that the particle will have a periodic trajectory , with probability 1 .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath9 the particle s motion is a sequence of self - avoiding cycles between returns to its initial position , which numerical simulations suggest to be unbounded and , therefore , non - periodic .",
    "when @xmath1 , the particle can , as it moves through the lattice , create a number of structures .",
    "these structures , which we refer to as _ reflecting structures _ ( see section [ sec:2 ] ) , cause the particle to reverse its entire trajectory back through every one of the lattice sites it has previously visited .",
    "importantly , two of these reflectors can trap the particle , limiting its motion to a finite subset of the lattice and cause the particle to have a periodic trajectory ( see theorem [ thm:1 ] ) .    these reflecting structures and their role in causing periodic dynamics ,",
    "have been previously observed in this and other llg models @xcite . in this paper though we describe , how the particle not only _ creates _ these structures , but how the particle can also _ transform _ and _ annihilate _ them . by studying the interplay of these three processes of creation , transformation , and annihilation ,",
    "we are also lead to introduce the concepts of semi - reflecting structures as well as transforms of reflecting structures ( see section [ sec:3 ] ) . the processes of reflector creation , transformation , and annihilation , as well as the notions of semi - reflecting structures and reflector transforms , are each important for the particle s dynamics and are used to show , that the particle s motion will be periodic for @xmath1 , with probability 1 ( see section [ sec:4 ] ) .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath9 , as was considered in @xcite , the particle , between returns to its initial position , has a self - avoiding motion .",
    "since this self - avoiding motion also appears to be unbounded , the difference between the particle s periodic self - limiting motion , which occurs for @xmath1 , and its self - avoiding motion , which happens for @xmath9 , is quite striking .",
    "hence , as @xmath2 approaches either @xmath155 or @xmath286 , what we observe is that the particle undergoes a _ discontinuous",
    "_ dynamical transition from a periodic , self - limiting motion to a non - periodic self - avoiding mode of motion .    by combining the results in this paper , regarding the particle s self - limiting motion , with the theory previously developed in @xcite , which describes the particle s self - avoiding behavior ,",
    "we are able to qualitatively describe the particle s transition between these two types of motion . for @xmath2 close to 0 or 1 , we find that , while the particle s transient , or short term , dynamics consists of a finite number of self - avoiding cycles , its long term dynamics is ultimately periodic . as @xmath2 approaches 0 and 1 ,",
    "i.e. when the initial orientations of scatterers become more homogenous , we observe that the particle s period becomes increasingly longer , so that , in the limit as @xmath2 approaches either 0 or 1 , the particle s motion is no longer bounded , but is entirely composed of an infinite sequence self - avoiding cycles .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that for @xmath9 , it is not possible for the particle to form reflecting structures , suggesting that an absence of reflecting structures leads to non - periodic behavior .",
    "stated another way , as the medium through which the particle moves , becomes increasingly homogenous , the particle becomes less able to build reflectors until at @xmath9 , where the lattice is completely homogeneous , these structures can no longer exist .    to better understand why random initial configurations allow the particle to form reflecting structures",
    ", we also consider in this paper a generalization of our original @xmath45 model . in that model , which we refer to as @xmath293 , the initial configurations of the scatterers are _ not _ identically distributed , but are still independently chosen .",
    "we find that even without being identically distributed , the particle s trajectory will still be periodic ( see section [ sec:6 ] ) .",
    "in contrast , if the initial orientations of the scatterers are _ not _ chosen independently , this can drastically change the particle s dynamics , even if these orientations are identically distributed ( see section [ sec:7 ] ) .",
    "hence , the particle s motion in the llg we consider in this paper , although deterministic , depends on the particular statistical properties of the model s initial configuration .    the findings in this paper also lead to a number of open questions . one is , whether admissible configurations , including the random admissible configurations introduced in this paper , _ always _ lead to non - periodic and therefore unbounded motion .",
    "numerically , we observe this , but whether this can be proved mathematically , is unknown .",
    "this is related to a second open question , regarding the geometric nature of the self - avoiding cycles found in those flipping rotator models with an admissible initial configuration . in each case , these cycles appear to have a fractal - like structure , but it is unknown to what extent this is , or is not , the case .",
    "indeed , an understanding of the geometry of these cycles and their dependence on the system s initial configuration could be important in a number of applications , since self - avoiding walks are used to model the growth of crystals , polymers , etc . @xcite .",
    "additionally , there are questions regarding the reflecting structures , that are found in the models considered here . for instance , one of these questions is whether , reflecting structures are the only mechanism that can cause periodic motion .",
    "indeed , if this could be shown to be the case , then we have an affirmative answer to the open question , whether or not admissible configurations _",
    "always _ lead to unbounded trajectories , via corollary [ cor:2 ] ( see section [ sec:5 ] ) .    as we plan to show in later papers , the notions of reflector creation , transformation , and annihilation , are also relevant for other two - dimensional llg models , that have yet to be considered in the literature .",
