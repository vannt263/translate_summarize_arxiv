    "<S> , @xmath2 sets a bound on the speed of the information propagation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> besides diagnosing chaotic behavior , the otoc can be used to identify the many - body localization ( mbl ) phase @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> black holes have been providing a fascinating arena for the interplay of general relativity , condensed matter physics and quantum information . </S>",
    "<S> the development in this direction becomes more exciting in recent years when the gauge / gravity duality , as a powerful tool for understanding the strongly correlated system , has rendered new insights into quantum critical phenomena and chaotic behaviors in many - body system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the butterfly effect has extensively been studied in this context @xcite . in the study of high energy scattering near horizon and information scrambling of black holes </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the butterfly effect ubiquitously exists and is signaled by a shockwave solution near the horizon @xcite ( see also appendix [ appendix - butterfly ] ) . especially , a bound on chaos has been proposed as @xmath15 and the saturation of this bound has been suggested as the criterion on whether a many - body system has a holographic dual with a bulk theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one remarkable example that saturates this bound is the sachdev - ye - kitaev ( syk ) model @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> our main purpose is to connect the butterfly effect and qpt in holographic approach . since in holographic theories the bound in ( [ bound1 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> is always saturated , we will focus on the behavior of the butterfly velocity @xmath2 close to quantum critical points ( qcp ) may exhibit a peak near qcp in the bose - hubbard model . ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the first signal to connect @xmath2 and qpt comes from the fact that both the butterfly velocity @xmath2 and the phase transition are controlled by ir degrees of freedom in chaotic quantum system @xcite . this picture becomes more vivid in holographic scenario since ir degrees of freedom of the dual field theory is reflected by the near horizon data , and both @xmath2 and qpt depend solely on the near horizon data . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the otoc exhibits butterfly effect for any operator that affects the energy of the bulk theory @xcite , while qpt is characterized by the degeneracy of ground states , implying that the butterfly effect should be sensitive to qpt since they involve energy fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is highly possible that the otoc or the butterfly effect can capture the qpt in holographic theories .    a heuristic argument about the relation between @xmath2 and qpt comes from the different behavior of the information propagation during the transition from a mbl phase to a thermalized phase . </S>",
    "<S> a quantum system in mbl phase does not satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis ( eth ) , and the quantum information propagates very slowly @xcite . in thermalized phase </S>",
    "<S> , however , the information propagates much faster . in other words </S>",
    "<S> , the speed of information propagation probably works as an indicator of a mbl phase transition . </S>",

    "<S> inspired by above considerations , we propose that the butterfly velocity @xmath2 can characterize the qpt in generic holographic theories </S>",
    "<S> . we will present evidences for this proposal with two holographic models involving mit as an example of qpt , and demonstrate that the second derivatives of @xmath2 with respect to system parameters do capture the qpt by showing local extremes near qcps . also , we point out possible experiments to test our proposal in laboratory .    _ </S>",

    "<S> the holographic description of mit has been studied in @xcite , where the lattice structure plays a key role in generating relevant deformations to near horizon geometry . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we consider two holographic models exhibiting mit , which have been presented in [ appendix - mit1 ] and [ appendix - mit2 ] ( for more details of both holographic models , we refer to @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , one essential ingredient for distinguishing the metallic phase and insulating phase is the temperature behavior of dc conductivity @xmath16 , which can be completely determined by the horizon data as well . </S>",

    "<S> this reflects the fact that our metallic phase corresponds to @xmath35 ir geometry solely , which is also in accordance with the results in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> further evidence for our proposal can be found in the second model [ appendix - mit2 ] , which does not contain @xmath35 geometry as ir fixed point . in this model , it is again the second derivative of @xmath2 that characterizes the qcp . </S>",

    "<S> we have demonstrated that the second derivative of @xmath2 with respect to system parameters diagnoses the qcp with local extremes . as an extension </S>",
    "<S> we believe the scenario of @xmath2 characterizing qpt is applicable to other holographic models with mit ( for instance the isotropic lattice model , the lattice with helical symmetry or massive gravity ) , and also to other holographic models exhibiting other sorts of qpt . </S>",
    "<S> of course in these circumstances the characterizing style of @xmath2 can be more diverse .    </S>",
