    "as a crucial characteristic of evolutionary algorithm ( ea ) , the utilization of population enables explorations to different parts of the search space via a number of individuals .",
    "although over the past decades most practical eas employ populations , the rigorous theoretical investigations on the impact of population on evolutionary algorithms were mainly carried out in the recent eight years . concerning this issue",
    ", he and yao @xcite took one of the first attempts via the comparisons of the mean first hitting times of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 eas on a class of multimodal problems derived from the well - known onemax problem , and the purpose is to demonstrate the impact of population .",
    "later , a number of theoretical investigations have been dedicated to study the first hitting times of eas with either multiple parents @xcite or offsprings @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the eas under investigations , which were known as @xmath2 and @xmath3 eas , can establish a bridge from analyzing the @xmath1 ea to studying @xmath4 eas . in the meantime",
    ", it is also reported that the recent investigations on eas with multiple parents and offsprings ( e.g. , @xmath0 eas ) have eventually brought to the community broader perspectives on understanding the behaviors of population - based eas .",
    "_ analyzed the time complexity of @xmath0 ea on some well - known unimodal problems @xcite and a wide - gap problem @xcite .",
    "lehre and yao studied the impact of mutation - selection balance on the performance of @xmath0 ea with linear ranking selection on a multimodal problem @xcite , but the influence of employing different population sizes was not investigated .",
    "it is still not clear how different population sizes influence the performance of @xmath0 ea on multimodal problems . in this paper , we carry out theoretical investigations on this issue .    to study the effect of population size via theoretical investigation , it is clear that we need a suitable measure of performance for eas .",
    "most previous investigations adopt the well - known first hitting time measure , which is a random variable demonstrating the number of generations required by the ea to find the global optimum for the first time . here",
    "we denote by @xmath5 the first hitting time , and @xmath6 the accumulated probability of @xmath5 .",
    "we further denote by @xmath7 and @xmath8 the first hitting times of two arbitrary eas , say , ea - i and ea - ii , respectively .",
    "if the following conditions holds    * @xmath9 is a polynomial function of the problem size @xmath10 ; * @xmath11 is a super - polynomial function of the problem size @xmath10 ; * @xmath12 $ ] is super - polynomially close to @xmath13 ; * @xmath14 $ ] is super - polynomially close to @xmath15 ,    then one can conclude that ea - i is more efficient than ea - ii with a probability that is super - polynomially close to @xmath13 .",
    "a recent example , which successfully utilizes the above methodology in comparison of different eas , is provided in @xcite . however , when considering the following case , direct comparison of the first hitting times would become infeasible :    * @xmath9 is a polynomial function of the problem size @xmath10 ; * @xmath11 is a super - polynomial function of the problem size @xmath10 ; * @xmath16 is a super - polynomial function of the problem size @xmath10 ; * the reciprocal of @xmath12 $ ] is bounded from above by some polynomial function of @xmath10 ; * the reciprocal of @xmath17 $ ] is bounded from above by some polynomial function of @xmath10 ; * @xmath18 $ ] is super - polynomially close to @xmath15 .",
    "the reason is that ea - i is likely to perform as inefficient as ea - ii .",
    "nevertheless , since ea - i still takes a relatively high probability to perform efficient while ea - ii performs inefficiently almost surely , we can still compare the performances of ea - i and ea - ii by employing the _ solvable rate _ as an alternative measure , where the solvable rate is the probability that the ea finds the global optimum of an optimization problem within a polynomial number of generations .",
    "the solvable rate can be considered as a generalized measure based on the probability distribution of the traditional first hitting time measure , and it concerns more about the probability with which an ea performs efficiently in general , rather than the detailed computation time for finding the optimum .",
    "in fact , in previous investigations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the idea of solvable rate has been utilized implicitly in company with the first hitting time results , though it has not been adopted as a measure of performance .    by employing the solvable rate measure in this paper",
    ", we carry out theoretical analysis to study the impact of the population size on the performance of an @xmath0 ea on a multimodal problem .",
    "this multimodal problem , which is called the trapzeros problem , contains a global optimum @xmath19 and a local optimum @xmath20 .",
    "the attraction basin of the global optimum only consists of solutions with the leading substring made up of @xmath21 consecutive 1-bits . to find the global optimum ,",
    "the ea has to enter its basin of attraction first by resisting the selection pressure which tends to preserve the solutions with leading 0-bits . for the @xmath0 ea on the above problem , we consider three cases for the population size @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where the well - known @xmath1 ea is considered as a special case of @xmath0 ea ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "it is discovered that when the population size is relatively small ( @xmath23 or @xmath24 ) , the solvable rate of @xmath0 ea is still larger than the reciprocal of some polynomial function of the problem size , which implies that the ea , if running on an appropriate polynomial number of processors simultaneously and independently , can find the global optimum with a polynomial number of generations .",
    "however , given a large enough population size @xmath25 , the solvable rate of the @xmath0 ea has dropped to a level that is super - polynomially close to @xmath15 , implying that the ea can not find the global optimum within a polynomial number of generations , unless one can offer a super - polynomial number of processors for the ea to run on .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : pre ] introduces the algorithm and problem investigated in this paper .",

    "in this section , we introduce the concrete optimization problem and ea investigated in this paper .",
    "the _ maximization _ problem we consider in this paper , defined over the domain @xmath26 , is called trapzeros : @xmath27 the trapzeros problem is a multimodal problem , and its global optimum is @xmath28 . for trapzeros , increasing the leading 0-bits in its solution",
    "may eventually lead to the local optimum @xmath20 instead of leading to the global optimum @xmath19 . to reach the attraction basin of the global optimum ,",
    "an optimization algorithm should first find some solutions with the leading substring consisting of @xmath21 consecutive 1-bits .",
    "otherwise , the selection pressure of an ea will tend to preserve the solutions with leading 0-bits . to facilitate the later investigations , we define three schemata as follows : @xmath29 where `` @xmath30 '' can represent either @xmath15 or @xmath13 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the schemata containing the global optimum . fig .",
    "[ fig : problem ] illustrates the fitness landscape of trapzeros with respect to the schemata defined above , and it shows that the individuals belonging to @xmath31 are strictly better than any individual belonging to @xmath33 , while the individuals belonging to @xmath33 are strictly better than any individual belonging to @xmath34 . utilizing this property",
    ", we will carry out rigorous analysis of an ea on trapzeros later .",
    "[ htbg ]       the @xmath0 ea studied in this paper is with equal parent and offspring sizes .",
    "the detailed algorithm is described as follows :    1 .",
    "* initialization : * the @xmath22 initial individuals are generated uniformly at random , and the initial population @xmath35 is obtained .",
    "* mutation : * at the @xmath36 generation ( @xmath37 ) , the @xmath22 individuals in the parent population @xmath38 are mutated , and the offspring population @xmath39 is obtained .",
    "the mutation of each individual in @xmath38 utilizes the _ bitwise mutation _ ,",
    "i.e. , each bit of the individual is flipped independently with a uniform probability @xmath40 , where @xmath10 is the problem size .",
    "* selection : * after the mutation step at the @xmath36 generation ( @xmath37 ) , the best @xmath22 individuals in the parent and offspring populations ( @xmath41 ) are selected to form the population @xmath42 , which is the parent population of the @xmath43 generation . afterwards , set @xmath44 and then go to the mutation step .",
    "the execution of the ea will stop if the stopping criterion is met .",
    "the above algorithm adopts the truncation selection , and does not employ any recombination operator .",
    "the investigation of eas with recombination operator and other selection operators will be left as our future work .    with respect to the @xmath0 ea ,",
    "the population size @xmath22 must be a polynomial function of the problem size @xmath10 , otherwise each generation of the ea would require super - polynomial number of fitness evaluations .",
    "when @xmath23 , the above @xmath0 ea degenerates to the well - known @xmath1 ea @xcite .",
    "so far we have introduced the problem and algorithm investigated in this paper . in this subsection , we present the measure of performance for ea .",
    "first , let us review the first hitting time @xmath5 , which is defined formally as below : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the global optimum , and @xmath47 is the population at the @xmath36 generation . as the example we have presented in section i , the first hitting time measure may sometimes become invalid for comparing the performance of two eas . here",
    "we provide an alternative measure , the solvable rate , to deal with the situation shown in the aforementioned example .",
    "denoted by @xmath48 , the solvable rate is formally defined by @xmath49 where the event @xmath50 means that there exists some polynomial function ( of the problem size @xmath10 ) @xmath51 such that @xmath52 holds for any @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is a positive constant . generally speaking , to derive appropriate bounds for the solvable rate , we have to concern the first hitting time @xmath5 . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the mathematical tools for our further investigations .",
    "in this section , we present the analytical tools utilized in this paper .      first of all , three well - known probabilistic inequalities are necessary to our later analysis . the inequalities are presented as the following lemmas :    [ lemma : chernoff]let @xmath55 be @xmath56 independent random variables with a same distribution : @xmath57=\\mathbb{p}[x_j=1],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 .",

    "further , we denote by @xmath73 the whole population set containing all populations . based on the aforementioned definitions of the three schemata , we now present the decomposition of the population set @xmath73 , which is necessary for our analytical approaches :    * we denote by @xmath74 the population set consisting of population @xmath75 with its best individual belonging to neither @xmath32 nor @xmath33 . * for any population @xmath75 with its best individual belonging to @xmath32",

    "we call an individual @xmath101 the advanced loib for @xmath108 ( advanced loib for short , if we restrict the discussion on a given @xmath105 ) , if and only if @xmath101 is the loib of a population @xmath103 satisfying that @xmath109",
    ".    so far we have defined loia and loib so as to characterize the individuals belonging to the attraction basins of the global and local optima respectively , which enables us to define the so - called takeover times for the @xmath0 ea .",
    "briefly , the takeover time , proposed by goldberg and deb @xcite , originally measures the number of generations required by the population to accumulate enough promising individuals , where a repeated selection process is concerned .",
    "_ @xcite generalized the concept of `` takeover process '' to characterize the behavior population - based eas on unimodal problems containing no local optimum . in this paper , on the trapzeros problem , we further define two types of takeover processes for the global and local optima respectively :    a population @xmath75 is said to be @xmath110-takeover ( @xmath111 , and @xmath112 ) if and only if its number of the @xmath100-loias has reached @xmath113 ( i.e. , the proportion of loias in @xmath75 has reached @xmath114 ) , where all advanced loias are pessimistically considered as @xmath100-loias .",
