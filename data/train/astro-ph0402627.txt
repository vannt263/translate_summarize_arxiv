    "narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) galaxies belong to the family of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and owe their name to the peculiar properties that distinguish them from the other type 1 agns . in general a seyfert 1 ( s1 ) is classified as nls1 when its nuclear spectrum shows the permitted lines only slightly broader ( fwhm(h@xmath2 km s@xmath3 ) than the forbidden ones @xcite . but nls1 galaxies are characterized also by a strong fe ii emission , a soft x - ray slope steeper than the slope typical for s1 galaxies , rapid and large soft x - ray variability @xcite , a weak big blue bump in the optical / uv range , likely shifted toward higher energies @xcite , a bright ir emission and a nuclear super - solar metallicity @xcite .    even though nls1s are known since almost twenty years @xcite , their nature is still a matter of debate .",
    "for example , at present the reason of the narrowness of broad permitted lines in nls1s is not clear .",
    "@xcite suggested that if the gravitational force from the central black - hole ( bh ) is the main cause of motion of the broad line region ( blr ) clouds , narrower optical emission lines will result from smaller @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) provided the blr distance from the central source does not change strongly with @xmath4 .",
    "these bhs with smaller masses are expected to accrete matter at near or super - eddington rates in order to maintain the relatively normal observed luminosities .",
    "recently @xcite proposed that nls1s may be relatively young agns hosting bhs still in a growing phase .",
    "nevertheless other authors suggested that if the blr clouds were largely confined to a plane , as it seems to happen in radio - loud agns ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein )",
    ", nls1 galaxies could be simply a case in which their blr is observed more face - on than in s1s ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite pointed out that also a partly obscured blr could justify narrow permitted lines , but these last two scenarios should produce polarization .",
    "they claimed that h@xmath6 polarization properties of the nls1s are indistinguishable from those of s1s , excluding obscuration of the inner regions of blr or a face - on orientation of a disk - like blr as the explanation for the relatively narrow broad - line profiles .",
    "the connection between physical properties of nuclear supermassive bhs and their host galaxies , on which several works have focused in the last years , might turn out to be a powerful tool to understand the nature of nls1s and settle the above cited controversies . @xcite",
    "first found out a correlation between bh mass ( @xmath4 ) and the absolute b magnitude of the spheroidal component ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "@xcite determined @xmath4 values for a sample of 32 nearby galaxies and suggested that @xmath4 is proportional to the @xmath8 such that on average @xmath9 0.005 .",
    "other authors estimated a similar mass ratio , @xmath10 0.002 ( see e.g. , ho 1999 ) .",
    "recently , studying a sample of nearby galaxies @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have shown that @xmath4 is tightly correlated with the velocity dispersion of the bulge stellar component ( @xmath11 ) , although they disagreed about the value of the slope .    in agns as well , bhs are also expected to correlate with their host bulges .",
    "this possibility was explored on a sample of pg quasars by @xcite who found agreement with the relation of @xcite .",
    "later @xcite claimed that seyfert galaxies show on average a @xmath12 ratio systematically lower than that for normal galaxies and quasars .",
    "conversely @xcite included in their work seven agns for which the @xmath4 were obtained by means of the reverberation mapping technique .",
    "they found that these objects were in agreement with their previously found @xmath4@xmath11 correlation .",
    "further support came from @xcite , and from @xcite who studied samples of quasars and seyfert galaxies , and did not find any evidence that seyfert galaxies follow a different @xmath13 relation from quasars or nearby galaxies .",
    "+ until now no agreement has been found about nls1s . @xcite and very recently @xcite and @xcite showed that the @xmath12 ratio in nls1s is significantly smaller than that for seyfert galaxies .",
    "conversely @xcite , studying a sample of 59 nls1s observed spectroscopically by @xcite , found that there is non clear difference in the @xmath4@xmath11 relation ( where @xmath11 is represented by the [ o  iii ]  emission line width ) between nls1s , broad - line agns and nearby galaxies .",
    "our purpose in this work is to investigate the nature of nls1s by exploring the physical properties of their bulges , namely the luminosity and the nuclear stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "our approach makes use of both new observational data and data from the literature .",
    "the necessary corrections are applied to the latter in order to obtain as homogeneous as possible a dataset .",
    "furthermore , as a main difference with respect to several other works on this topic , when determining the bulge properties of the host galaxies we take into account the influence of the agn , which , as we show , can be non - negligible and affect the results considerably .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in  2 we present our dataset and derive and compare bh mass values for a sample of nls1s and s1s . in ",
    "3 we estimate the blue absolute magnitudes and the stellar velocity dispersions of their bulges .",
    "our results are summarized and discussed in  4 .",
    "firstly , we have isolated a list of 23 nls1 and 23 s1 galaxies of the northern emisphere from @xcite on the basis of their `` s1n '' and `` s1.0 '' classification and of the redshift , z @xmath14 , chosen to avoid that h@xmath15  and [ o  iii ]  lines fall in a spectral region with strong night - sky emission lines . +",
    "no other selection criteria were applied .",
    "this sample is complete up to visual magnitude 15.5 , corresponding to the 80 per cent of the selected galaxies , and therefore it is useful for our purposes .",
    "+ out of this sample , we were able to collect optical spectra for 22 nls1s and 15 s1s .",
    "in particular 19 nls1s and 7 s1s were extracted from the public data available in the isaac newton group ( ing ) archive .",
    "these spectra were obtained for different purposes in 1995 , 1996 , 1999 and 2000 , mostly with the intermediate dispersion spectrograph ( ids ) mounted at the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope ( int , canary islands , spain ) , and the others with the isis double beam spectrograph ( isis ) at the 4.2 m william herschel telescope ( wht , canary islands , spain ) .",
    "other 3 nls1s and 8 s1s were observed directly by us in 2002 september and in 2003 january using the asiago faint object spectrograph and camera ( afosc ) mounted at the 1.82 m telescope of the padova astronomical observatory ( asiago , italy ) .",
    "tables  [ tab1 ] and  [ tab2 ] summarize the instrumental setup and the total wavelength coverage for each observation",
    ".    all spectra were reduced with the same procedure .",
    "the usual data reduction steps - bias and flat field corrections , cosmic rays removal , wavelength linearization , sky - background subtraction and flux calibration- were carried out with iraf packages .",
    "a one - dimensional spectrum of the nucleus was obtained for each galaxy summing a number of pixels along the spatial direction on the basis of the seeing conditions .",
    "when available , adjacent spectral ranges of the same source were combined together .",
    "then a correction for galactic extinction was applied using for each galaxy the value given by ned and the @xcite extinction law .",
    "the so - processed spectra were shifted to the rest frame and the intrinsic absorption was removed following the technique used by @xcite .",
    "in particular we have determined the value of the internal reddening using the relation : @xmath16 $ ] , where x is the ratio of the mrk 478 continuum fit to that of the other galaxies of the sample evaluated at the effective wavelengths of b ( 4400  ) and v ( 5500  ) photometric bands .",
    "contrary to @xcite we could not use as reference mrk 493 , whose spectrum was available only for wavelengths @xmath17 4400 thus yielding a rather uncertain estimate of x@xmath18 .",
    "the spectrum of mrk 478 was used , instead , after correction for internal absorption by means of the hydrogen column density @xmath19 , given by @xcite .",
    "+ one of the peculiar features in the optical spectrum of most nls1 galaxies is the presence of strong emission of fe  ii  multiplets centered at 4570  , 5190   and 5300  . in order to remove them and allow a more precise measure of h@xmath15  and [ o  iii ]   emission lines",
    "we have produced a fe  ii  template using the spectrum of the nls1 i zw 1 as suggested by @xcite .",
    "the template was scaled in intensity and conveniently smoothed to match the spectrum of each galaxy showing evident fe ii multiplets , and then subtracted .      a fast inspection of each galaxy spectrum allowed us to isolate four nls1s , mrk 1126 , mrk 291 , mrk 957 and hb 1557 , which in our opinion are wrongly classified .",
    "after a multi - gaussian fit of h@xmath15 , and h@xmath6+[n  ii]@xmath206548,6583  emission lines we can assert that these active nuclei have permitted lines with a clear composite broad@xmath21narrow profile , where the narrow components have widths similar to those of the forbidden lines ( @xmath22 km  s@xmath3 ) ( fig .",
    "this kind of profile is typically shown by intermediate seyfert galaxies .",
    "indeed @xcite introduced the notation seyfert 1.5 , 1.8 , and 1.9 , to indicate the simultaneous presence of narrow and broad permitted lines in many spectra of seyfert galaxies .",
    "broad h@xmath15  and h@xmath6  components were fitted in mrk 1126 and mrk 291 , obtaining widths of about 2600 - 2900 km  s@xmath3  , while only h@xmath6-broad was detected in mrk 957 and hb 1557 , and fitted to widths of about 1600 and 3000 km  s@xmath3respectively .",
    "we observe that the value of h@xmath6-broad in mrk 957 is lower than the others .",
    "this could be caused by a non reliable multigaussian fit of h@xmath6+[n  ii ]  blend .",
    "indeed we have the impression that a blue [ n  ii ]  component exists in addition to the others already identified , but the spectral resolution is not sufficiently high to obtain a stable fit of the profile with six or more gaussians .",
    "moreover we noted that mrk 957 is the only out of the four galaxies showing fe ii multiplets , whose strong emission is one of the typical features of nls1s .",
    "therefore we excluded these four galaxies from our sample of nls1s , but we included ugc 3478 until now wrongly classified as s1 .",
    "ugc 3478 has an optical nuclear spectrum typical of nls1s : we have found narrow balmer emission lines ( fwhm(h@xmath15)=1600 km  s@xmath3 ) , a low [ o  iii]@xmath235007/h@xmath15  ratio ( = 4.8 ) , and a strong emission of [ fe  ii ]  multiplets .",
    "moreover the luminosities of the low ionization emission lines , [ n  ii]@xmath236583 , [ s  ii]@xmath206716,6731  and [ o  i]@xmath236300 , assume weak values .",
    "the asca hard x - ray spectrum , available in tartarus database , shows a steep power law distribution with photon index @xmath24 similar to that given by @xcite for nls1s ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the stellar dynamical techniques to derive bh masses are severely limited for agns , since they require high",
    "s / n measurements of stellar absorption features which are often lost in the glare of a bright active nucleus @xcite .",
    "the alternative solution consists in applying the virial theorem to the blr clouds , gravitationally bound to the central mass and located at distances of few light - days ( s1s ) to several light - weeks ( quasars ) :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the radius of the blr , v the velocity of the broad - line emitting gas , and g the gravitational constant .",
    "even if there is no general consensus about the dynamics of the blr , evidence for keplerian motions of the blr clouds was found by @xcite and @xcite using the reverberation mapping technique .",
    "this is one of the major tools for studying correlated variations of the lines and continuum emission of agns and determine the size ( @xmath27 ) and the geometry of the blr ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "+ however , the lack of long term variability monitoring makes it difficult to measure @xmath27 of most seyfert galaxies using this method . as an alternative",
    ", @xmath27 can be estimated by the empirical relationship between the blr size and the luminosity of the continuum at 5100  found by @xcite :    @xmath28^{0.700\\pm0.033 } \\label{kr}\\ ] ]    since the blr consists of photoionized clouds of gas and the luminosities of nls1s and s1s are generally comparable,(see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , we applied this relation , whose validity for a few nls1s was proved by @xcite . indeed",
    "after having measured @xmath29 ( 5100 ) .",
    "] for each object of our sample we have verified that nls1s and s1s have similar optical luminosity of continuum ( log @xmath29 ( 5100 ) = 43.51@xmath300.65 vs. 43.08@xmath300.45 respectively ) , as can be seen in fig .  [ f2 ] .",
    "+ some authors produced substantial evidence that the broad - line emitting material has a flattened disk - like geometry in radio - loud quasars ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "such evidence is less strong for radio - quiet agns , even if very recently @xcite found that a high percentage of agns showing double - peaked balmer lines are radio - quiet .",
    "therefore , we have estimated the parameter v from the emission - line width of h@xmath15  by assuming that the velocity dispersion in the line emitting gas is isotropic and after having removed the instrumental width :    @xmath31    the resulting @xmath4 values are listed in tables  [ tab6 ] and [ tab7 ] . as expected",
    "nls1s have on average bhs with smaller masses than s1s : log @xmath4 = 6.65@xmath300.64 vs. 7.37@xmath300.62 , a result which depends directly on the narrowness of the balmer emission lines , since nuclear luminosities and therefore blr radii are quite similar in both samples .",
    "similar considerations can be found in a contemporary paper by @xcite .",
    "+ of course such @xmath4 values are characterized by some uncertainties , and we have tried to analyze them .",
    "first of all the uncertainties given in equation ( [ kr ] ) produce errors @xmath32 per cent concerning @xmath27 calculated values .",
    "second , the luminosity of the continuum is affected by flux calibration errors and by intrinsic varibility of the sources . about this last point , following the discussion by @xcite , who noticed that the continuum variation is not larger than a factor of two for most agns",
    ", we assumed a @xmath33 per cent error as upper limit .",
    "the spectrophotometry accuracy , evaluated through multiple observations of standard stars , was estimated around @xmath34 per cent for archival data , and @xmath35 per cent for asiago data . combining these errors together we obtain a @xmath36 per cent error for @xmath27 .",
    "the final uncertainty of @xmath4 is likely less or around @xmath37 per cent , corresponding to @xmath38 dex in logarithmic scale .",
    "it should be taken into account that a non negligible fraction of optical light may come from the host galaxy , especially in case of low luminosity agns . since",
    "a precise estimate of the host contribution is not straightforward , we decided to neglect it and remain closer to the procedure followed by @xcite to obtain their empirical relation .",
    "after having calculated the masses of the bhs hosted by each galaxy of our samples of nls1s and s1s , we have investigated the physical properties of their bulges deriving their blue luminosities and the values of the central stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "then we have explored the connection between bulges and nuclear bhs in order to find out where nls1s are placed with respect to s1s .",
    "since we did not have at our disposal photometric data to measure b - band magnitudes ( @xmath39 ) , we took from literature , when available , the values for the objects of our samples @xcite .",
    "when we found multiple estimates we calculated a median value .",
    "+ the @xmath39 were corrected for galactic extinction ( @xmath40 ) , taking values given by @xcite , and internal absorption ( @xmath41 ) , following the relation given in the introduction to the third reference catalogue of bright galaxies ( * ? ? ?",

    "inclination values @xmath45 were extracted from hyperleda database .",
    "the k correction was also applied ( @xmath46 ) , again by following the method described in rc3 .",
    "contrary to what done by several other authors , we decided to take into account the emission - line and non - stellar continuum contributions from the agn to the total magnitude of each galaxy . to do this",
    "we followed the approximations given by @xcite .",
    "in particular we used the formulae ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) given in that paper for @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which are the effective continuum fluxes in b - band due to the forbidden and balmer emission lines . instead , before calculating the nonstellar continuum flux @xmath49",
    ", we noticed that @xcite assumed a typical value of @xmath10100  as equivalent width of h@xmath15  .",
    "since we have the spectra and the underline continuum of h@xmath15  is very similar to the already measured continuum at 5100 , we could take as approximation @xmath50 , having adopted a power law with spectral index @xmath51 as done by @xcite .",

    "[ f3 ] . it can be easily noticed that @xmath46 plays a minor role in the total contribution to the magnitude corrections , while @xmath53 is as important as and sometimes even more important @xmath41 and @xmath55 .",
    "this strongly indicates that neglecting @xmath53 can be a dangerous approximation when bright agns are considered .    after having converted @xmath56 into absolute magnitudes @xmath57 , listed in table  [ tab3 ]",
    ", we obtained the bulge magnitudes ( @xmath58 ) by applying the formula given by @xcite , who found a relation between the bulge - to - total ( b / t ) luminosity ratio and the morphological type : @xmath59 .",
    "the morphology of each galaxy was extracted from ned and checked by visual inspection of the poss ii digitized images , for lower redshift sources , which did not require high spatial resolution , and of the hst public images , when available in the archive , for higher redshift galaxies .",
    "we excluded the sources for which a `` compact '' classification was given .",
    "+ the resulting magnitudes show that nls1s have typically lower luminosity bulges than s1s : + @xmath60 vs. @xmath61 .",
    "giving a realistic estimate of the magnitude errors is not an easy task .",
    "all our photometric data are taken from literature , based on ccd observations , and given mostly with accuracy @xmath62 mag .",
    "but our @xmath63 values are affected by additional errors , which are introduced by the application of the correction terms : @xmath64 and @xmath65 . + among them , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are both dependent on the morphological type t , and the error caused by a wrong classification will be typically lower than 0.1 mag .",
    "@xmath65 is also a function of t , and increases strongly for late - type spirals .",
    "a maximum uncertainty @xmath68 in the morphological classification of our objects translates into errors @xmath69 and @xmath70 mag for early- and late - type spirals , respectively .",
    "@xmath71 is dominated by the contribution of the agn continuum , since the emission lines affect only @xmath1010 per cent of the total correction .",
    "therefore @xmath71 depends on the spectrophotometric calibration of the continuum , and e.g. an accuracy of 20 per cent will correspond to an uncertainty of @xmath10 0.2 mag .    in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] we plotted @xmath72 values against @xmath73 .",
    "nls1s are represented by filled dots , while s1s by empty triangles . for completeness",
    ", we decided to include in this analysis a sample of 14 quasars ( asterisks ) , whose @xmath74 and @xmath7 are given by @xcite .",
    "the sources were selected from their list excluding those having a @xmath74 error greater than the value itself .",
    "the absolute magnitudes were corrected for agn contribution using only the measured continuum flux at 5100 , available in the same paper ( table  [ tab4 ] ) . as expected after having calculated the median values of the plotted physical quantities , nls1s fall in the lower ranges of the plot , and are well separated by s1s both in bh mass and bulge luminosity values , even if a region of overlap inevitably exists .",
    "moreover , nls1s , s1s and quasars seem to be well correlated in the plane @xmath75 .",
    "therefore we attempted a least square fit ( represented by the solid line in fig .  [ f4 ] ) considering all points together , and obtaining :    @xmath76    with a correlation coefficient r@xmath77 .    in order to check the consistence of this result , we first converted blue absolute magnitudes into v band , by applying the morphological type dependent b  v values given by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their table 4 ) , and we did a new fit : @xmath78 .",
    "then we applied the standard relation : @xmath79 and a mass - to - luminosity conversion for bulges and spheroidal galaxies found by @xcite : @xmath80 , obtaining as a result :    @xmath81    in table  [ tab5 ] we compare our result with similar @xmath82 relations investigated by other authors .",

    "+ on the contrary @xcite found a steeper relation ( @xmath83 ) for a sample of 22 narrow line agns .",
    "the lower number of points and the limited range of the bulge mass values in comparison with their scatter could be at the origin of this result .",
    "indeed the slope of their relation shows an error significantly larger than those presented by other authors . a more stable and less uncertain fit can be obtained by considering also broad - line agns , therefore spanning a wider range in both the physical quantities , bh and bulge masses .",
    "@xcite also found a steeper relation ( 1.36@xmath300.15 ) .",
    "a possible explanation could be that the @xcite relation is defined by using monochromatic luminosity , while @xcite started from bolometric luminosity and applied a constant to convert into @xmath84 .",
    "contrary to what happens for most of s1 galaxies @xcite , measuring @xmath11 in nls1s with optical spectra is very difficult and sometimes even impossible because of the presence of large and bright fe  ii  multiplets , which completely suppress the typically used stellar absorption lines , like _",

    "for example , they noticed that seyfert galaxies with high radio luminosity tend to have [ o  iii]@xmath235007 widths broader than what expected in case of gravitational motion , because the gas kinematics can be influenced by the presence of a radio jet .",
    "they also stressed a slight tendency for barred and/or disturbed seyfert galaxies to have broader [ o  iii]@xmath235007 emission lines .",
    "indeed @xcite pointed out that the distribution and kinematics of near - nuclear gas can be altered during galaxy interactions .",
    "since @xmath11 measurments are available in literature only for few seyferts of our sample , we choose to use fwhm([o  iii]@xmath235007 ) for the others .",

    "we notice a larger scatter in our relation with respect to @xcite .",
    "this is mostly caused by the stellar velocity dispersions of nls1 galaxies , whose values span a range similar to that of s1s .",
    "contrary to what we obtained in ",
    "3.1 , this should suggest that nls1 and s1 galaxies are separated when their bh masses are considered , but identical in their bulge properties .",
    "moreover , all nls1s remain below the fit with some of them closer to the line and , therefore , showing lower stellar velocity dispersions corresponding to lower bh masses , while other nls1s have clearly larger @xmath11 than expected .",

    "a similar result was already obtained by @xcite , and very recently by @xcite , who used a large sample of low redshift nls1s extracted from the sloan digital sky survey , and by @xcite , who used a sample of nls1s extracted from the rosat all - sky survey .",
    "they found that nls1s mostly deviate from the @xmath101 relation defined by @xcite , showing @xmath11 values higher than expected .    a possible reason for this scatter could be a spectral resolution not sufficient to measure with high precision the low @xmath11 values predicted by the fit .",
    "this objection is well discussed and rejected by @xcite . moreover , in our case , those targets observed at higher resolution are just nls1s , while s1s , even if observed at lower resolution , show a similar range of @xmath11 values .",

    "starting from the assumption that the emission line clouds of blr are gravitationally bound to the bh and in random motion , we have calculated bh masses of nls1s obtaining a typical logarithmic value of 6.65@xmath300.64 m@xmath112 , which is almost one order of magnitude lower than the value obtained for s1s ( 7.37@xmath300.62 m@xmath112 ) .",
    "simultaneously we have confirmed that nls1s and s1s have quite similar nuclear luminosities : ( in logarithm ) , 43.51@xmath300.65 l@xmath112 and 43.08@xmath300.45 l@xmath112 respectively .",
    "the physical properties of the bulges were investigated in nls1s and s1s by means of photometric and spectroscopic data .",
    "+ published total apparent b magnitudes were corrected for extinction , inclination , redshift and agn contribution , and converted into absolute magnitudes .",
    "then , the bulge magnitudes were calculated taking advantage of the empirical b / t  morphology relation given by @xcite , and used by several authors .",
    "we plotted these values against bh masses for nls1s and s1s , adding quasars extracted from literature , and we found that nls1s are mostly confined in the lower ranges of the @xmath113 plane .",
    "this result suggests that nls1s are characterized by less massive bhs hosted in less massive bulges than s1s .",
    "this is in agreement with previous findings of @xcite , who explored only the @xmath101 relation , and in contrast with @xcite and @xcite , who claimed for nls1s with lower @xmath114 ratios .",
    "it is not straightforward to justify the different results found by these authors . after a careful inspection of the effects introduced by each correction we applied to the photometric data of our targets",
    ", we can observe that the slightly different way we calculated the correction terms for agn contribution and galaxy inclination seem to cause changes which roughly compensate each other .",
    "therefore we guess that the main source of disagreement is the morphological classification , which strongly affects the resulting bulge magnitudes by quantities in the range 0.25 - 0.5 dex for uncertainties discussed in  3.1 .",
    "a fit of nls1s , s1s and quasar values together shows a strongly correlated relation , @xmath115 , which leads to @xmath106 .",
    "since the slope is close to unity , we do not confirm the results by @xcite and @xcite who found a significantly non - linear bh  bulge correlation .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the bulge stellar component was also explored to check whether nls1s have also @xmath11 values typically lower than those measured in s1s .",
    "since few values of @xmath11 were available in literature , we had to calculate the others measuring the [ o  iii ]  emission line widths , and assuming that the gas kinematics is dominated by the bulge potential .",
    "as done before , we plotted these values against bh masses , adding quasars and also nearby non - active galaxies , and obtaining a good correlation @xmath116 .",
    "contrary to the previous result , nls1s are not clearly separated from s1s in the @xmath101 plane .",
    "in particular they span similar ranges of @xmath11 , suggesting that their bulges are in this respect identical .",
    "moreover , all nls1s of our sample fall below the fit , showing @xmath11 values higher than expected , and also below the relations found by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , which on the contrary are well in agreement with our s1s values . this discrepancy between the two results",
    "could be caused by the assumption of [ o  iii ]  widths as representative of the stellar kinematics .",
    "indeed the [ o  iii]-@xmath11 conversion has a large scatter and is not yet proved to be valid for nls1 galaxies",
    ". therefore we stress the necessity to directly measure @xmath11 , for example observing nls1s in spectral ranges different form the optical one .    since both relations are based on important assumptions , which can introduce significant errors , at the moment it is not possible to favor one over the other .",
    "the fact that , according to our first result , nls1 galaxies seem to have less massive bulges harboring equally less massive bhs than s1 galaxies , strongly indicates that the hypothesis of an inclination effect of a disk - like blr on the narrowness of balmer emission lines should be rejected , at least for most nls1s . a pure selection effect is not expected to be related to the physical properties of the bulges , and therefore nls1s should be just those s1s with intrinsecally smaller bulges to justify the difference we observe between nls1s and s1s . on the other hand , our second result confirms the smaller @xmath117 ratio in nls1s , which led @xcite and @xcite to suggest an evolutionary scenario for these agns toward a s1 stage . in particular , nls1s would be agns in a phase when bhs are growing independently from their hosting environment",
    ".    however , both cases support the general idea of nls1s in terms of agns with less massive bhs accreting matter at high rates in order to maintain nuclear luminosities comparable to those of s1s , as we said above .",
    "moreover , our results are not in conflict with the evolutionary scenario and sustain the idea that nls1s are likely to be young s1s , even in case of a joined evolution of bh and bulge .",
    "in fact calculations by @xcite suggest time scales of the order of some @xmath118 yr for a nls1 to become a s1 .",
    "this time scale is in agreement with the growth time of a spiral bulge through minor merger phenomena .",
    "indeed @xcite demostrated through n - body simulations that a minor merger makes significant disturbances to the morphology of a larger galaxy in less than 1 gyr of the onset of the merger .",
    "moreover @xcite showed that the accretion of small satellites is an effective mechanism for the growth of bulges in spiral galaxies .",

    "<S> in this work we aim at addressing the still open question about the nature of narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) galaxies : are they really active nuclei with lower mass black - holes ( bhs ) than seyfert 1 ( s1 ) and quasars ? </S>",
    "<S> our approach is based on the recently discovered physical connections between nuclear supermassive bhs and their hosting spheroids ( spiral bulges or ellipticals ) . in particular </S>",
    "<S> we compare bh masses of nls1s and s1s analyzing the properties of their hosts by means of spectroscopic and photometric data in the optical wavelength domain . </S>",
    "<S> we find that nls1s fill the low bh mass and bulge luminosity values of the @xmath0 relation , a result strongly suggesting that nls1s are active nuclei where less massive bhs are hosted by less massive bulges . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation is good with a relatively small scatter fitting simultaneously nls1s , s1s and quasars . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , nls1s seem to share the same stellar velocity dispersion range of s1s in the @xmath1 relation , indicating that nls1s have a smaller bh / bulge mass ratio than s1s . </S>",
    "<S> these two conflicting results support in any case the idea that nls1s could be young s1s . </S>",
    "<S> finally we do not confirm the significantly non linear bh  bulge relation claimed by some authors . </S>"
