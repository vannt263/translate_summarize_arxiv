    "a complete understanding of the physical processes involved in the formation of galaxies requires a knowledge of the young galaxy populations at high redshift .",
    "these primeval galaxies are thought to exhibit bursts of star formation possibly associated with active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , detectable through the resulting strong emission lines .",
    "various detection techniques have been explored over the years in search of these star forming galaxies .",
    "each detection technique introduced has both advantages and disadvantages , and therefore it is important to explore many different techniques to obtain a view of the primeval galaxy population as complete as possible .",
    "the lyman - alpha emission line has been the target of many surveys aimed at the detection of high redshift galaxies ( see reviews by @xcite ) , but turned up only a small fraction of the expected number of strong emission line sources .",
    "more recent deep surveys @xcite have detected some ly@xmath2 emitters , but at lower luminosity .",
    "the large - area lyman alpha survey @xcite currently being conducted has turned up a number of ly@xmath2 emitters , indicating that these sources are detectable with an adequate volume coverage and sensitivity .    an alternative method , which does not rely on the presence of a strong ly@xmath2 line , is the lyman break technique @xcite .",
    "this technique involves the detection of both a blue uv continuum and the lyman limit spectral drop at a rest - frame 912 .",
    "this technique has proved very effective at identifying @xmath3 galaxies .",
    "spectroscopic analysis @xcite has shown a near zero mean ly@xmath2 emission , which is consistent with the lack of strong ly@xmath2 emitters in the line - based surveys .",
    "highly reddened sources would not be selected by the lyman break technique .",
    "high redshift ( @xmath4 ) near - infrared emission - line surveys search for rest - frame optical emission lines , such as h@xmath2 @xmath56563 , [ o  iii ] @xmath55007 , h@xmath6 @xmath54861 , or [ o  ii ] @xmath53727 .",
    "the attenuating effects of dust are far less at longer wavelengths , so these emission lines can detectable in dustier galaxies .",
    "ground - based emission line surveys have primarily targeted fields containing objects with known redshifts ( @xmath7 ) , typically quasars and radio galaxies @xcite , or damped ly@xmath2 systems and strong metal absorbers , @xcite , but also blank fields @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite used the hubble space telescope nicmos camera to conduct a parallel , slitless spectroscopic survey .",
    "targets are selected at specific redshifts which place the strong optical lines into the bandpasses of existing near - infrared narrowband filters . @xcite and @xcite spectroscopically confirmed two emission - line galaxies .",
    "in this paper we present followup observations on the 18 candidate emission - line objects from ( * ? ? ? * hereafter mtbw98 ) , identified in a survey covering 227arcmin@xmath8 .",
    "we obtained both optical and near - infrared observations on the majority of their sources .",
    "our goal was to investigate the morphology , color , and confirm the presence of the emission lines . in  [ obs ] we describe the observations and reduction methods . in  [ results ] we discuss the results , including possible reasons for why many of the objects were not confirmed . finally , in  [ sum ] we summarize our results and discuss prospects for future surveys using a narrowband near - infrared imaging technique .",
    "for simplicity and to ease comparisons with prior surveys , we assume a cosmology of @xmath9@xmath10 kms@xmath11mpc@xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . assuming a lambda cosmology , with @xmath14kms@xmath11mpc@xmath11 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , would increase projected separations by a factor of two , or the derived star formation rates or areas surveyed by a factor of four .",
    "deep @xmath17 band images covering 12 of the 18 emission - line candidates from mtbw98 were acquired with the ccd imager in the queue observing mode of the 3.5 m wiyn telescope from august to november 1997 .",
    "the imager uses a 2048@xmath18 pixel ccd at 0195 per 21@xmath19 m pixel , resulting in a 666 square field of view .",
    "the data were obtained using a harris r filter with a central wavelength of 646 nm and a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 153 nm .",
    "standard ccd processing was used to bias - subtract , flatfield , mask the hot pixels , align , and then stack the images .",
    "the seeing in the data were good , with an average 062 fwhm .",
    "the deep observations were not obtained under photometric conditions , so calibration images were acquired for each field during photometric weather on subsequent nights .",
    "the photometric images were calibrated onto the vega scale using the @xcite standards .",
    "the images reach limiting ( 5@xmath20 ) magnitudes between 257 and 264 .",
    "infrared images were taken in either the @xmath21 or @xmath22 band , and in the corresponding 1.237@xmath19 m or 2.248@xmath19 m narrowband ( nb , @xmath23 ) filters for 15 of the 18 sources from mtbw98 .",
    "images were obtained on ut 1999 july 22 and 23 with the near - infrared camera @xcite on the keck i telescope .",
    "nirc uses a 256@xmath18 insb detector at 015 pixel@xmath11 resulting in 384 square field of view . the data consisted of 10 - 15 dithered images for each object , with 30s exposures for the broadband ( bb ) data and 180s for the narrowband data .",
    "thus , typical exposure times were 5 minutes in the broadband filters and 30 minutes in the narrowband filters .",
    "the seeing ranged from 03 to 05 fwhm in @xmath22 and 05 to 06 in @xmath21 .",
    "all observations were obtained under photometric conditions .",
    "using iraf routines , images were dark subtracted and flatfielded using a combination of domeflats and skyflats .",
    "the bad pixels were masked using separate narrowband and broadband bad pixel masks because the longer exposure times for the narrowband images resulted in more saturated hot pixels .",
    "images were then aligned and stacked .",
    "the broadband data were calibrated onto the vega scale using the @xcite standard stars .",
    "the narrowband zero - points were scaled to the broadband data to give the continuum objects in a given filter set a zero mean color for the night .",
    "photometry on the objects was extracted in a 2@xmath24 diameter aperture .",
    "this relatively small aperture was used to minimize contamination from nearby objects .",
    "the photometric uncertainties quoted in table  [ tbl-1 ] are determined by the iraf / apphot package from a local measure of the sky noise around each source .",
    "the uncertainties are not corrected for errors in determining the zero points , which we estimate at 3% for the broadband data and 10% for the narrowband data .",
    "this has no effect on the relative colors of the sources .",
    "we constructed color magnitude diagrams for each field , plotting the ( bb - nb ) color against the narrowband magnitude .",
    "continuum objects appear at zero color because of the relative photometric calibration of the narrowband images .",
    "an emission - line object will have a positive color since the total flux of the narrowband image will be due mostly to the emission - line and not the continuum .",
    "in addition , the broadband and narrowband image pairs were `` blinked '' in order to visually confirm the sources with excess narrowband flux as well as search for new emission line galaxies .",
    "the images were displayed such that the continuum objects in the field had the same apparent brightness in both images , thus emission - line sources appear brighter in the narrowband image relative to the broadband .",
    "of the fifteen emission - line candidates from mtbw98 we confirmed strong emission in three sources , with ( bb - nb ) colors ranging from 0.75 to 2.22 magnitudes .",
    "no new emission - line sources were identified .    in the following sections we present notes on the individual sources .",
    "table  [ tbl-1 ] lists the optical and near - infrared magnitudes and uncertainties for each source , as well as values derived from the color excess , such as the line equivalent widths , line fluxes , and star formation rates ( sfr ) .",
    "figures  [ fig1]-[fig3 ] show broadband and narrowband image pairs for each confirmed emission - line source and a color magnitude diagram .",
    "the color magnitude diagrams were plotted from larger images ( @xmath2560@xmath24 square ) , and therefore contain data for more sources than are visible in the 20@xmath24 square images .",
    "the field of quasar q0100 + 130 ( phl 957 ) was targeted by mtbw98 due to the presence of a strong civ absorption line system at @xmath26 @xcite , which places the redshifted [ o  ii ]  @xmath27 line at 1.237@xmath19 m .",
    "the emission line candidate q0100 + 13b shows a strong emission - line with a ( j-1.237@xmath19 m ) color excess of 1.04@xmath280.20 magnitudes .",
    "we derived a rest frame equivalent width of 60  and a line flux of @xmath29 ergs @xmath30 s@xmath11 . assuming the emission - line is [ o  ii ]  @xmath27 at @xmath31",
    ", we used an [ o  ii ] to h@xmath2 line ratio in @xcite with no correction for extinction to derive a star formation rate of 31@xmath32 m@xmath33 yr@xmath11 . if significant dust extinction is present , this star formation rate is a lower limit .",
    "q0100 + 13b is separated from the quasar by 512 at a position angle ( pa ) of 356 .",
    "the corresponding projected comoving separation from the quasar is 668@xmath1  kpc ( 202@xmath1  kpc proper separation ) .",
    "this is much larger than the size of an individual galaxy . since this source has the lowest projected separation of",
    "the three confirmed emission - line objects from their corresponding quasar s line - of - sight , none of these galaxies are likely to be responsible for the absorption - line systems targeted by mtbw98 .",
    "q0100 + 13b is marginally resolved with a 06 fwhm in the continuum subtracted image , however there are no good point sources in the nirc image to directly compare to and we used a seeing average of 05 fwhm for the night in the @xmath21 filter . the moderate equivalent width and",
    "the slightly resolved morphology make q0100 + 13b more consistent with the interpretation that the line emission is powered star formation , but with the current data we can not rule out an active nucleus .",
    "the quasar q0201 + 365 was targeted because of a strong civ absorption line system at z=2.424 @xcite , which places the redshifted h@xmath2 at 2.248@xmath19 m .",
    "we confirm strong emission from the candidate q0201",
    "+ 36d , with a ( k-2.248@xmath19 m ) color excess of 0.75@xmath280.19 magnitudes .",
    "we derived a rest frame equivalent width of 67  and a line flux of @xmath34 ergs @xmath30 s@xmath11 . assuming the line is h@xmath2 at @xmath35",
    ", we used the luminosity to h@xmath2 ratio from @xcite to derive a sfr of 12@xmath32 m@xmath33 yr@xmath11 . q0201 + 36d is separated from the quasar by 1163 at pa=1411 .",
    "the corresponding projected comoving separation is 1.55@xmath1 mpc .",
    "the seeing in the q0201 + 36d field was 04 fwhm .",
    "a profile fit to the continuum subtracted image failed to converge , so we resorted to a more subjective assessment of the source resolution .",
    "a bright point source was extracted from elsewhere in the image , scaled down to a comparable flux as the emission line source , and then shifted and added back into the image next to the emission line source .",
    "a visual comparison of the two shows that q0201 + 36d is clearly resolved . if the emission is h@xmath2 at a redshift 2.42 , then the relatively low equivalent width and star formation rate , along with the diffuse nature of the emission line flux , suggest that this source is a star forming galaxy and not an agn .      as with the other two sources ,",
    "the quasar q2038 - 012 was targeted due to a strong civ absorption line at z=2.424 @xcite .",
    "we confirm strong emission in candidate q2038 - 01d in the 2.248@xmath19 m narrowband filter .",
    "our data show that q2038 - 01d is resolved into two compact sources , both with emission lines , separated by 08 ( 10@xmath1 kpc ) . by masking out one source and measuring the photometry on the other , we measured the north - east ( ne ) and south - west components to have a color excess of 1.91@xmath280.41 and 2.88@xmath280.46 magnitudes , respectively .",
    "the derived rest - frame equivalent widths are quite high , over 10@xmath36  for the sw component under the assumption that the line is h@xmath2 at the targeted redshift .",
    "such a high equivalent width would be unusual even for an active nucleus .",
    "there remains the possibility that this source is at a higher redshift , perhaps seen in the [ o  iii ] or [ o  ii ] line .",
    "spectroscopic data covering one or more additional lines could resolve this issue .",
    "we note that the equivalent width becomes highly non - linear for a ( @xmath37 m ) color in excess of two magnitudes , going to infinity at 296 where all of the broadband flux is from the emission line .",
    "q2038 - 01d is 1208 from the quasar at pa=1265 .",
    "the corresponding projected comoving separation is 1.60@xmath1 mpc .",
    "the seeing in these data were especially good with an average of 03 fwhm .",
    "we measured the fwhm of each object by first masking out the other source .",
    "both components were formally resolved , with a 045 fwhm , but the sw component appears more compact .",
    "faint , diffuse , elongated emission is visible on both sides of these sources in the narrowband image .",
    "q2038 - 01d is most likely two galaxies in the process of merging , where the gravitational interaction is fueling perhaps both star formation and an agn .",
    "while the rest - frame equivalent width in the ne component is possible to produce with a pure starburst , the much larger equivalent width in the sw component almost surely indicates the presence of an active nucleus .",
    "all three confirmed emission - line objects had bluer ( r - k ) colors than the unconfirmed objects from mtbw98 .",
    "the ( r - k ) colors for the three confirmed sources range from 2.97 to 3.28 magnitudes .",
    "the mean color for a field sample at similar k - band magnitudes is 3.93 @xcite , indicating that these emission - line objects may not suffer from heavy dust obscuration , and it would be interesting to see if the rest - frame uv lines are visible with visual wavelength spectroscopy . while the original survey ( mtbw98 ) should be sensitive to emission - line sources with more dust extinction than the uv techniques , in practice any objects with emission lines in the narrowband filter would be identified .",
    "this may indicate that very dusty sources are rare , but the number of objects found is still small .",
    "twelve of the fifteen candidates from mtbw98 did not show signs of an emission - line in our data .",
    "we propose two possibilities to explain this .",
    "the most straightforward scenario is that the objects are not truly emission - line sources , but spurious detections in the narrowband survey data .",
    "the other scenario is that instrumental idiosyncrasies could combine to cause effective shifts between the actual band - passes of the narrowband filters .",
    "each candidate object in mtbw98 was given a rank degree of significance , with 1 as the highest and 3 as the lowest .",
    "all three of our confirmed sources had a rank of 1 or 2 , while the unconfirmed candidates had ranks of 2 or 3 .",
    "each of our confirmed objects has the highest signal to noise ratio ( snr ) of all objects in the same field , ranging from 3.0 to 5.6@xmath20 in mtbw99 , and the snr was very low for many of the other sources .",
    "so perhaps the emission - line candidates are simply spurious detections , selected from noise peaks in the narrowband survey data .",
    "we consider this the most likely explanation .",
    "the other possibility for a lack of emission - line detection is due to effective bandpass shifts between the narrowband filters used in the survey and this followup .",
    "the actual bandpass of the narrowband filters , as seen by individual objects , is a function of both its relative position in the field and any tilts of the filters in the pupil planes of either instrument .",
    "these effects are difficult to quantify a posteriori . by using two separate filters with these unknown variables",
    ", an emission line may be within the bandpass of one filter , but not necessarily the other .",
    "therefore we can not conclusively rule out the presence of emission lines in our twelve unconfirmed sources .",
    "we observed 15 candidate emission - line sources from mtbw98 and confirmed strong emission in three .",
    "these galaxies may be associated with quasar metal absorption line systems at @xmath0 , however , wide separations ( 0.6 - 1.6@xmath1 mpc ) from the quasars indicates that they are not directly responsible for the absorption systems .",
    "while it is likely these galaxies are at the targeted redshifts , confirmation requires spectroscopic observations of one or more additional emission lines . from the color excess of the galaxies we derived line fluxes , star formation rates , and equivalent widths .",
    "source resolution and line equivalent widths in two galaxies are consistent with line emission powered by star formation , while the third galaxy , which is actually double , is consistent with the presence of an active nucleus .",
    "the blue ( r - k ) colors for the sources , as compared to field galaxies , suggest a relatively low dust content",
    ". these galaxies may therefore be detectable in ly@xmath2 or other rest - frame uv emission lines .",
    "several new , wide - field near - infrared instruments are currently working or nearing completion on 4 m class telescopes . here",
    "we specifically consider omega-2000 @xcite at the calar alto 3.5 m telescope , with a 15.4 @xmath38 15.4 arcmin@xmath18 field of view , wirc-2k @xcite at the palomar 200-inch telescope with a 8.3 @xmath38 8.3 arcmin@xmath18 field of view , and flamingos @xcite at the kitt peak 4 m telescope with a 10 @xmath38 10 arcmin@xmath18 field of view .",
    "mtbw98 reached line flux limits of @xmath39 ergs @xmath30 s@xmath11 , which we consider to be a conservative estimate for the new cameras , assuming 2 hour narrowband plus 30 minute broadband exposure times . under these assumptions ,",
    "new narrowband surveys can cover an order of magnitude more area than mtbw98 in just 3 - 10 nights , a moderate - sized project , especially when split over more than one semester .",
    "note that the large fields of view cover projected comoving fields of up to 12@xmath3812@xmath32 mpc@xmath18 at z=2.4 , much larger than the size of a cluster core .",
    "even surveys targeting known objects would then largely sample blank fields . removing the restriction of where to point , a purely blank field survey is free to target regions with low galactic dust extinction and use the narrowband filters with maximum transmission or minimum background to increase the survey depth .",
    "additional survey volume can be covered at the expense of reducing the color contrast by using somewhat broader narrowband filters ( e.g. @xmath40% ) .    for 8m - class telescopes ,",
    "currently operating near - infrared instruments include isaac on the eso vlt ut1 @xcite , with a field of view of 2.5@xmath382.5 arcmin@xmath18 , cisco on the subaru telescope , with a field of view 1.8@xmath382.5 arcmin@xmath18 @xcite , and niri on the gemini - north telescope @xcite , with a 2@xmath382 arcmin@xmath18 field of view . under the same assumptions as before ,",
    "an order of magnitude more area than @xcite can be covered to similar depth in 6 - 10 nights .",
    "the fields of view are comparable to the mtbw98 survey , @xmath41mpc , and thus it may be preferable to continue targeting known high - redshift sources . in the years",
    "since the mtbw98 or @xcite surveys were done , many new quasar damped ly@xmath2 and metal absorption line systems have been discovered , significantly increasing the list of potential targets .",
