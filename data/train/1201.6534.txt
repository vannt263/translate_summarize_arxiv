    "newton s `` superb theorem '' for the gravitational @xmath0 force states that a spherically symmetric mass distribution attracts a body outside as if the entire mass were concentrated at the center .",
    "the name `` superb theorem '' was used by s.  chandrasekhar in _ _",
    "newton s principia for the common reader__@xcite and by j.  w.  l.  glaisher.@xcite see also i.  b.  cohen and a.  whitman.@xcite    the superb theorem is of crucial importance for newton s comparison of terrestrial gravity ( the fall of the apple ) with the orbit of the moon .",
    "newton wrote that@xcite `` the same year [ 1666 ] i began to think of gravity extending to the orb of the moon    from kepler s rule of the periodical times of the planets ",
    "i deduced that the forces which keep the planets in their orbs must [ be ] reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the centers  : and thereby compared the force requisite to keep the moon in her orb with the force of gravity at the surface of the earth , and found them to answer pretty nearly . ''",
    "the superb theorem is also crucial for an exact solution of the kepler problem : finding the orbit of a planet under the attraction of the sun ( neglecting the attraction between planets ) for two spherically symmetric bodies with a @xmath0 force between mass elements .",
    "when newton first made the comparison of the moon s orbit with the fall of the apple , he had no knowledge of the superb theorem .",
    "he assumed that considering the mass of the earth to be concentrated at the center to obtain the magnitude of the gravitational field on the surface of the earth was nothing more than an approximation : `` it might be ",
    "accurate enough at greater distances  wide off the truth near the surface of the planet ",
    ", where the distances of the particles are unequal ",
    ".''@xcite newton suspected the superb theorem to be false until 1685 , as he wrote in his letter to halley of 20 june 1686.@xcite    newton proved the superb theorem in 1685 , one year before finishing the _ principia _ , in which the theorem was published as proposition 71 of book i in 1687 . we know from newton s",
    "own words that `` he had no expectation of so beautiful a result till it emerged from his mathematical investigation.''@xcite in chandrasekhar s words : `` the superb theorem is most emphatically against common sense   unless one had known its truth already.''@xcite    chandrasekhar translated newton s geometrical proof into modern notation.@xcite see also refs .   and .",

    "for a test mass inside a homogeneous spherical shell of matter , newton s proposition  70 of book i states : `` if to every point of a spherical surface there tend equal centripetal forces decreasing as the square of the distances from those points , i say , that a corpuscule placed within that surface will not be attracted by those forces any way.''@xcite    for the analogous case of the @xmath0 law of electrostatics , newton s proposition 70 was tested by the null experiment of henry cavendish in 1773.@xcite    newton s elementary geometric proof of proposition  70 ( ref .",

    "the attractions per unit test mass at @xmath3 by these two areas , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , are equal and opposite because ( 1 ) the gravitational force decreases as the square of the distance , while the surface areas of the source , cut out by the cone of given solid angle @xmath4 , increase as the square of the distance ; and ( 2 )  the angles @xmath9 between the infinitesimally thin cone ( in both directions ) and the normals to the source sphere at both intersection points ( radial lines @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) are equal . because the entire solid angle around the point @xmath3 can be divided into such double cones , the resultant attraction is zero .",
    "newton s geometric proof of proposition  70 ( our sec .",
    "ii ) uses his  evanescent quantities , \" that is , vanishing quantities ( infinitesimals ) , and in particular his `` method of ultimate ratios '' ( title of sec .",
    "i of book  i):@xcite in the scholium at the end of this section newton explains ``    the ultimate ratio of evanescent quantities is to be understood not as the ratio of quantities before they vanish  , but the ratio with which they vanish . ''",
    "newton emphasizes that `` ultimate ratios with which quantities vanish are not ratios of ultimate quantities , but limits with which the ratios of quantities decreasing without limit are continually approaching , and which they can approach so closely that their difference is less than any given quantity.''@xcite in the case of the proof of prop .  70 , it is the ultimate ratio of the magnitudes of the attraction by the evanescent ( that is , infinitesimal ) source areas .",
    "newton does not write @xmath12 instead he discusses the analogous arcs in his plane figure and in his proof . in his notation",
    "he uses the endpoints of the small arcs .",
    "but newton emphasizes that his evanescent arcs can be replaced by straight lines : newton s evanescent arcs are infinitesimal .    throughout the principia ,",
    "newton uses ultimate ratios , with which he is `` solidly in a contemporary tradition of fermat , blaise pascal , huygens , james gregory , and isaac barrow.''@xcite in this scholium newton wrote that `` i have presented these lemmas   to avoid the tedium of ",
    "lengthy proofs by ` reductio ad absurdum ' in the manner of the ancient geometers.''@xcite    euclid and archimedes presented early forms of infinitesimal thinking in the `` method of exhaustion '' ( of eudoxus ) combined with `` reductio ad absurdum . '' @xcite an example is the proof by archimedes that the area inside a circle is equal to the product of the radius times half of the circumference : in the method of exhaustion one can cut the circular disc radially into an increasing number @xmath13 of identical slices , one compares the thin slices with inscribed ( respectively , circumscribed ) triangles ; that is , one compares the circular disc with an inscribed ( respectively , circumscribed ) @xmath13-sided polygon .",
    "@xmath13 can be chosen arbitrarily large . in a simplification by leonardo da",
    "vinci one considers @xmath13 even and reassembles the triangles in an alternating sequence to obtain an area arbitrarily close to a rectangle for @xmath13 arbitrarily large . if somebody claimed that the area of the circular disc is some given number which is smaller than the radius times half the circumference , one `` reduces this to absurdum '' ( proof by contradiction ) by choosing @xmath13 so large that the total area of the inscribed triangles is larger than the claimed result .",
    "one then repeats the argument with circumscribed triangles .",
    "newton s geometric proofs in the principia use evanescent quantities ( i.e. infinitesimals ) . but",
    "these proofs do not use the machinery of calculus developed by newton and leibniz .",

    "ii ) .      the superb theorem considers a spherical shell of matter as the source of gravity and gives the ( radial ) acceleration of a test particle at the observation point @xmath3 outside the source shell ( observation point at a distance @xmath1 from the center ) , see fig .",
    "instead we analyze the equivalent problem of one source particle located at @xmath7 , as shown in fig .",

    "the steps needed for calculating this spherical average are explained before eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) .",
    "the proof of the equivalence of the two problems is given in two steps :    1 .",
    "we consider the average over the spherical observation surface of the radial component of the acceleration , @xmath14 , measured outside the spherical mass shell at the distance @xmath1 from the center .",
    "this average is obtained by multiplying @xmath15 by the area element @xmath5 on the observation surface , summing the contributions , and then dividing by the total surface area .",
    "the average is equal to the radial acceleration at any one of the observation points , such as the point @xmath3 , because of the spherical symmetry of the source in the first problem , as shown in fig .",
    "this first step appears trivial , but it is necessary to make the second step possible .",
    "the spherical average on the observation sphere of the radial component of the acceleration yields the same contribution from each single source element of equal mass in the spherical source shell , such as @xmath7 , because of the spherical symmetry of the observation surface [ see fig .",
    "hence , it is sufficient to consider the contribution of only one source mass - element at the point @xmath7 , that is , the equivalent problem of fig .",
    "2(b ) , and later sum over the equal contributions of all other source elements of equal mass .",
    "the crucial point is that the geometry is much simpler for the solution of our equivalent problem , fig .",
    "2(b ) ( one point inside a shell ) , than the complicated geometry needed by newton to solve the original problem , fig .",
    "2(a ) ( one point outside a shell ) .",

    "the equivalent problem and its solution in sec .",
    "[ solution.equiv.problem ] is gauss s law in integral form for a spherical surface .      the equivalent problem of fig .",
    "2(b ) can be solved with the elementary geometric method shown in fig .  3 ; the method is analogous to newtons s method to prove proposition  70 ( given in sec .",
    "[ section.70 ] ) .",
    "we use the source point @xmath7 as the apex and consider an arbitrary ray which starts at @xmath7 , goes in one direction , and hits the spherical surface at the observation point  @xmath3 . at @xmath3 , the magnitude of the gravitational acceleration @xmath16 is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the small ( infinitesimal ) source mass at @xmath7 , and @xmath19 is newton s constant .",
    "the angle @xmath9 is the angle between the ray @xmath20 and the radial direction @xmath21 .",
    "the radial component of the gravitational acceleration at @xmath3 is @xmath22 around this ray from @xmath7 to @xmath3 , we consider a cone starting at the apex @xmath7 and of infinitesimally small solid angle @xmath4 , which will intersect the spherical observation surface by the surface area @xmath5 given by @xmath23 the first step in calculating the average of the radial accelerations over the observation sphere is to form the product of the radial acceleration given by eq .",
    "( [ radial.component ] ) , with the weight ( for averaging ) , which is the surface area element @xmath5 ( intersected by the cone ) given by eq .",
    "( [ surface.area ] ) : @xmath24 note the two cancellations in @xmath25 , which are the basis for the simplicity of our proof :    1 .",
    "the inverse square of the distance in the force law , @xmath26 , cancels @xmath27 in the surface area @xmath5 for a cone with solid angle @xmath4 .",
    "2 .   the ratio @xmath28 of the radial to the total acceleration cancels @xmath29 in the surface area @xmath5 for a cone with solid angle @xmath4 .    the second step in calculating the spherical average is to sum @xmath25 in eq .   over all surface area elements",
    "@xmath5 , that is , over the entire observation surface .",
    "the sum over @xmath30 is @xmath31 .",
    "the third step in taking the spherical average of @xmath15 is to divide by the total weight for averageing , which is the total area of the spherical observation surface , @xmath32 .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath33 this result for the spherical average of the radial accelerations is the same as if the single point mass @xmath18 were placed at the origin .",
    "the conversion back to the original problem , newton s superb theorem , now follows . for a spherically symmetric source shell ,",
    "the acceleration is radial , and because it is the same all over the observation sphere , there is no need to take the average over the spherical observation shell .",
    "therefore @xmath34 at every observation point outside the source shell .",
    "this result completes our geometric proof of newton s superb theorem .",
    "equation  ( [ average.radial.acceleration ] ) , which is equivalent to newton s superb theorem , is gauss s law in integral form@xcite for a spherical surface .",
    "gauss s law for the flux integral over a closed surface @xmath35 enclosing the volume @xmath36 , @xmath37 , a concept from vector calculus , is not taught in undergraduate or high school courses on newtonian mechanics .",
    "the superb theorem follows simply from equation  ( [ average.radial.acceleration ] ) , gauss s law in integral form for a closed spherical surface .    in taking the average of @xmath15 over the observation sphere",
    ", we had to sum over all infinitesimal surface area elements @xmath5 .",
    "this sum is called an `` ultimate sum '' in the principia,@xcite which corresponds to an integration in today s language . in the integration over @xmath30 ,",
    "the integrand is a constant , as given in eq .  .",
    "therefore the integration is reduced to calculating the surface of the sphere .",
    "we have given a simple geometric proof of the superb theorem along the lines of newton s simple geometric proof of proposition 70 .",
    "for a source with spherical symmetry and a radius - dependent density we add up the accelerations outside the source caused by all shells , and conclude that the result is the same as if all the mass was placed at the origin : newton s proposition 74 , which is needed for the falling apple .",
    "for two dissimilar spheres with different spherical radius - dependent density distributions we add up the contributions of matter shells and conclude that ( in newton s words at the end of proposition 76 ) `` the whole force with which one of these spheres attracts the other will be inversely proportional to the square of the distance of the centers , '' which newton found `` very remarkable . ''",
    "this proposition is needed for the attraction between moon and earth .    according to chandrasekhar,@xcite `` j.  e.  littlewood",
    "has conjectured ( though i do not share in the conjecture  ) that newton had perhaps first constructed a proof based on _ calculus _ which ` we can infer with some possibility what the proof was ' . ''",
    "chandrasekhar gives littlewood s conjectured proof , which consists of 14 equations .",
    "our geometric proof with four steps is simpler than littlewood s proof using calculus .",
    "equation  ( [ average.radial.acceleration ] ) for newtonian gravity is the same as the @xmath38 ricci - tensor equation in integrated form for einstein gravity ( general relativity ) for sources with @xmath39 relative to the observer .",
