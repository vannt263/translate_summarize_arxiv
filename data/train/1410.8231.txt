    "the accurate determinations of phase diagrams , equations of state ( eos ) , and thermodynamic properties of materials are of primary importance to the materials science , the high pressure science , and the geophysics .",
    "the high - pressure experimental techniques , including the diamond - anvil cell ( dac ) and shock wave ( sw ) experiments , are main ways to yield such properties precisely",
    ". however , except for high costs there are more or less limitations in these experimental techniques , such as pressure or temperature limit and the very short duration time of the compression process in sw experiment during which it is hard to detect phase transitions in real time .",
    "so it very urgently needed that accurate theoretical methods are developed to expand the pressure and temperature regime where experiments can not reach .",
    "current density of functional theory ( dft ) has been developed to a powerful tool widely used to calculate and predict all kinds of new properties of materials , and even design new materials theoretically before experimentation  @xcite . especially , the dft has been applied frequently to calculate the high pressure and high temperature ( hpht ) dependent properties including the equation of states , thermodynamic properties and phase diagrams under high pressure  @xcite . as for the hpht dependent properties ,",
    "the hydrostatic pressure changes subject to the volume changes of the crystal cell provided that the atoms positions are fully relaxed therein . and the inclusion of temperature effects can be realized either by the quasi - harmonic approximations ( qha ) or molecular dynamics simulations . the _ ab intio _ molecular dynamics simulations are computationally expensive . while the qha is relatively cheap and a good solution to count the temperature effects in materials simulations",
    "nevertheless , one has to gather the necessary information to extract gibbs free energies for all volumes considered before the calculations of hpht properties .",
    "and then the related properties and even the phase diagrams can be calculated by numerical techniques .",
    "this whole process is complex and time - consuming to finish manually . especially in the construction of phase diagrams for many structures ( more than two ) ,",
    "the comparison of their gibbs free energies and the judgment of stable field for each structure are tough work .",
    "this motivates us to design a package named phasego to accomplish all the complicated steps and plot the phase diagrams automatically .",
    "phasego is designed for the easy implementation of phase transition analysis and plot of phase diagrams .",
    "it can also calculate the thermodynamic properties of materials , including the thermal expansion coefficients , the bulk moduli , the heat capacities , the thermal pressures , the grneisen parameters , and the debye temperatures . for the dynamic response properties of materials ,",
    "phasego can automatically find the hugoniot pressure - volume and pressure - temperature relations according to the rankine - hugoniot conditions  @xcite .",
    "all these qualities can be obtained based on the qha by simply preparing a controlling file .",
    "more interestingly , based on the qha the possible phase boundaries of all the structures provided are analyzed and plotted automatically .",
    "so the high pressure and temperature phase diagram can be constructed and plotted easily by phasego .",
    "the qha is a phonon - based model of crystal lattice vibrations used to describe volume - dependent thermal effects , such as the thermal expansion .",
    "it starts from the assumption that the harmonic approximation holds for every value of the crystal volume , and then takes into account part of anharmonic effects by varying crystal volume .    in the framework of qha",
    ", the helmholtz free energy of a crystal is written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the first - principles zero - temperature energy of a static lattice at volume @xmath2 , and @xmath3 is the zero - point motion energy of the lattice given by @xmath4 the last term is the phonon free energy due to lattice vibrations , and can be obtained from @xmath5\\right\\ } ,    \\label{fph}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the phonon frequency of the @xmath7th mode of wavevector @xmath8 in the first brillouin zone .    for a metallic material ,",
    "the helmholtz free energy at high temperature includes the electronic thermal excitation free energy , @xmath9 @xmath10 can be evaluated by the finite temperature dft with the help of the fermi - dirac smearing  @xcite . at low temperature",
    ", @xmath10 is very small and can be neglected , but at high temperature it is large and probably changes final conclusions .",
    "if we write @xmath11 as @xmath12 it can also be calculated from the phonon density of states @xmath13 via  @xcite @xmath14\\mathrm{d}\\omega g(\\omega),\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the boltzmann constants .",
    "the phonon density of states is written as @xmath16.\\ ] ] and the total densities of states are normalized to , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the number of atoms in the unit cell and @xmath19 is the number of the unit cells .      for a crystal structure ,",
    "when obtained the helmholtz free energies at different volumes and fixed temperature , one can derive the analytical function of @xmath20 at certain temperature by fitting eos .",
    "the types of the eos in phasego package are : murnaghan  @xcite , birch  @xcite , 3rd - order birch - murnaghan  @xcite , 4rd - order birch - murnaghan  @xcite , vinet  @xcite , vinet universal  @xcite , 3rd - order natural strain  @xcite , 4rd - order natural strain  @xcite , and the 3rd and 4rd polynomial",
    ". then the pressure @xmath21 is obtained by @xmath22 one can calculate gibbs free energy @xmath23 as a function of temperature ( @xmath24 ) and pressure ( @xmath21 ) via , @xmath25    once the gibbs free energy is known , the phase stabilities and transitions can be determined by comparing the gibbs free energies of different structures at fixed pressure or temperature .",
    "other thermodynamic properties can be reduced numerically according to the thermodynamics relations  @xcite .",

    "the internal energy , entropy , and constant volume heat capacity of lattice vibrations can be directly achieved from the phonon density of states ( normalized to @xmath45 ) via  @xcite ,    @xmath46    @xmath47g(\\omega)\\mathrm{d}\\omega,\\ ] ]    and @xmath48 respectively .    according to the debye approximation",
