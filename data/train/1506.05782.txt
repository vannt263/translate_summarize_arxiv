    "since its formulation @xcite , the bohr - mottelson model remained the indispensable tool for interpretation of the collective phenomena in even - even nuclei , with numerous solutions being constantly proposed by considering different shapes and approximations for the potential energy @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "these simple solutions generated in turn other more involved approaches by considering octupole degrees of freedom @xcite and deformation - dependent mass terms @xcite , or more simple ones by imposing @xmath0-rigidity @xcite .",
    "the formalism of the bohr - mottelson model recently inspired similar approaches for the definition of collective hamiltonians related to such phenomena like the chiral modes @xcite or the wobbling excitations @xcite .",
    "the reformulation of the bohr hamiltonian in six dimensions @xcite is another recent noteworthy addition to the geometrical description of collective motion .",
    "the parameter independent solutions of the bohr hamiltonian are especially useful in the sense that they serve as reference points for the energy spectra and electromagnetic properties of nuclei .",
    "it was found that this is also the case for the critical point symmetries @xmath5 @xcite and @xmath2 @xcite describing the shape phase transitions from vibrational to @xmath0-unstable and respectively to the axially deformed nuclei .",
    "the @xmath5 solution is exact , while @xmath2 employs two approximations , one related to the separation of variables and the other based on the small angles for the @xmath0 shape variable .",
    "the domains of validity for these approximations were found to be incongruous when the hamiltonian is numerically diagonalized @xcite in the framework of the recently developed algebraic collective model @xcite . also , due to its structure , @xmath2 is parameter free only for the ground and @xmath1 bands , while the @xmath0 band is determined by the stiffness of the @xmath0 oscillations .",
    "all these shortcomings were commented on all accounts in @xcite , where an exactly separable version of the @xmath2 model denoted es-@xmath2 , was proposed . as in this case",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath0 degrees of freedom are treated on the same footing , the model will no longer be parameter independent , the whole energy spectrum depending on the @xmath0 stiffness parameter .",
    "the @xmath0-rigid version of this model , called @xmath3 @xcite , however will be parameter independent . although the @xmath0-rigidity hypothesis is somehow a crude one , it provides simple approaches with successful reproduction of the relevant experimental data @xcite .",
    "moreover , an unexpected similarity between the @xmath1 excited bands of @xmath2 and @xmath3 solutions was found , which inevitably address the question about the importance of rigidity in explaining the critical collective phenomena .    in the present work we propose a simple exactly separable model for the competition between the @xmath0-rigid and @xmath0-stable collective motion in the phase transition between spherical and deformed shapes .",
    "the coupling of the two types of @xmath1 vibration is achieved by introducing a control parameter measuring the degree of the system s @xmath0-rigidity in an ising type hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the separation of variables is achieved by considering a potential of the form @xmath6 @xcite adapted to the current problem . matching the two competing excitations ,",
    "the @xmath0 potential is chosen to be a harmonic oscillator centered in @xmath7 , which is consistent with the prolate @xmath0-rigid part of the problem . as the purpose of this paper is to investigate the @xmath0 rigidity near a critical point which is commonly identified with a very flat potential , @xmath8",
    "is taken to be an infinite square well .",
    "although the separation of the potential leads to independent analytical descriptions of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 degrees of freedom , it contravenes the liquid drop model prescription for the potential energy @xcite .",
    "however , the chosen potential shape can be simulated by considering higher order anharmonic terms in the generalized collective geometrical model @xcite .",
    "the energy spectrum and @xmath9 transition probabilities resulting from the proposed model depend up to an overall scaling factor on two parameters , namely the rigidity and the stiffness of the @xmath0 vibrations .",
    "their separate influence on the model s characteristics is investigated through numerical applications .",
    "the experimental realization of the model is found in few rare earth nuclei around @xmath10 .",
    "the kinetic energy operator associated to a prolate @xmath0-rigid nucleus is @xcite : @xmath11 , \\label{tr}\\ ] ] while in the @xmath0-stable case it is expressed as @xmath12 , \\label{ts}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the angular momentum operator from the intrinsic frame of reference with the corresponding components @xmath14 , while @xmath15 is the mass parameter .",
    "the interplay between @xmath0-stable and @xmath0-rigid collective motion is achieved by considering the hamiltonian : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a parameter which indicates the degree of the system s rigidity against @xmath0 vibrations .",
    "note that the prolate @xmath0-rigid limit @xmath18 is avoided in order to preserve the geometry of the curvilinear space .    in order to achieve an exact separation of the @xmath1 variable from the @xmath0-angular ones , the reduced potential is considered of the form similar to that used in @xcite but adapted for the present problem : @xmath19 factorizing the total wave function as @xmath20 ,",
    "the associated schrdinger equation is separated in two parts : @xmath21\\xi(\\beta)=\\epsilon\\xi(\\beta ) , \\label{b}\\ ] ] and @xmath22\\varphi(\\gamma,\\omega)=w\\varphi(\\gamma,\\omega ) , & & \\label{ga}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 . as the present model is based on the hypothesis of small oscillations around @xmath7 which cease at @xmath18 , the rotational term of the last equation",
    "is approximated as in @xcite : @xmath24 contrary to the @xmath0-unstable case @xcite , the @xmath0 and angular variables can also be separated by considering the product state @xmath25 . here",
    "@xmath26 are the wigner functions associated with the total angular momentum @xmath27 and its projections on the body - fixed and laboratory - fixed @xmath28 axis , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "averaging the approximated equation ( [ ga ] ) on this product state one obtains the following equation for the @xmath0 shape variable : @xmath31\\eta(\\gamma)=\\epsilon_{\\gamma}\\eta(\\gamma ) , \\label{ecg}\\ ] ] with @xmath32 for small oscillations around @xmath7 , the `` frozen '' value of the @xmath0-rigid part of the hamiltonian , it is natural to adopt a harmonic oscillator form for the @xmath0 potential , @xmath33 where the parameter @xmath34 defining the string constant of the oscillator is usually referred to as the stiffness of the @xmath0 vibrations .",
    "then ( [ ecg ] ) can be treated as in @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ by applying a harmonic approximation for the trigonometric functions around @xmath7 .",
    "this leads to a differential equation for @xmath0 which resembles the radial equation for a two dimensional harmonic oscillator : @xmath35\\eta(\\gamma)=\\epsilon_{\\gamma}\\eta(\\gamma ) .",
    "\\label{ecga}\\ ] ] the solutions are readily obtained in terms of the laguerre polynomials @xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a normalization constant and @xmath38 .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues are @xmath39 with @xmath40 for @xmath41 even and @xmath42 for @xmath41 odd , respectively . at this point",
    "it would be opportune to comment the implications of choosing such a @xmath0 potential .",
    "first of all it loses the symmetry properties required by the liquid drop model prescription for the potential energy @xcite .",
    "this results from the fact that the harmonic oscillator potential ( [ gamapot ] ) is obtained from the second order approximation of the symmetry obeying potential @xmath43 .",
    "secondly , the corresponding hamiltonian is no longer hermitical with respect to the scalar product defined with @xmath44 measure @xcite .",
    "however , the adopted approximation was demonstrated in @xcite to be reliable for high stiffness , condition which is achieved in the present model as will be shown in the numerical application .    in",
    "what concerns the @xmath1 degree of freedom , one will consider here an anharmonic behaviour reflected into a square well shape of the potential : @xmath45 where @xmath46 indicates the position of the infinite wall . in this way , by varying the rigidity parameter from @xmath47 to @xmath48 , the system will change from es-@xmath2 model @xcite to a quasi-@xmath0-rigid solution whose @xmath0-rigid limit is the @xmath3 model @xcite .",

    "the excitation energy of the whole system in respect to the ground state is then defined as @xmath58 , \\label{et}\\ ] ] where the set of quantum numbers @xmath59 uniquely identify a rotational band , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath60 for the ground band , @xmath61 and @xmath62 for the first @xmath1 and @xmath0 excited bands and so on .",
    "correspondingly the @xmath1 variable normalized wave function is then given as : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the normalization constant obtained from the condition @xmath65^{2}\\beta^{4}d\\beta=1.\\ ] ]    finally , the full solution of the hamiltonian ( [ ht ] ) after proper normalization and symmetrization reads @xcite : @xmath66.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with this function one can calculate the transition rates , employing the general expression for the quadrupole transition operator , @xmath67 , \\label{te2}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is a scaling factor .",
    "the final result for the @xmath9 transition probability is given in a factorized form @xcite : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the clebsch - gordan coefficient dictating the angular momentum selection rules , while @xmath15 and @xmath71 are integrals over the shape variables @xmath1 and @xmath0 with integration measures @xmath72 and respectively @xmath73 .",
    "note that in case of the @xmath74 transitions described by the first term of @xmath9 operator ( [ te2 ] ) , the @xmath0 integral reduces to the orthogonality condition for @xmath75 wave functions .",
    "the proposed model have two adjustable parameters not counting the scale , namely the stiffness @xmath34 of the @xmath0 vibrations and the rigidity @xmath76 . indeed , considering the energy spectrum and",
    "the @xmath9 transition probabilities normalized to the energy of the first excited state and respectively to its @xmath77 rate to the ground state , the dependence on the mass @xmath15 and the position of the infinite wall @xmath46 vanishes .",
    "the evolution as function of @xmath76 and @xmath34 of theoretically evaluated spectral observables such as @xmath78 ratio and the @xmath1 and @xmath0 band heads normalized to the energy of the first excited state is visualised schematically in figure [ ratios ] . from this figure",
    "one can see that the first two sets of curves corresponding to @xmath79 and @xmath80 collapse at @xmath48 to the values of the @xmath3 energy spectrum , namely 2.44 and respectively 2.87 .",
    "although the @xmath3 solution by construction excludes the existence of the @xmath0 band , our approach at @xmath48 provides the value 1 for the @xmath0 band head . at @xmath47 , the corresponding values of es-@xmath2 model",
    "are recovered for all three ratios . however , up to the @xmath48 limiting case the ratio @xmath79 as well as the two excited band heads have quite different behaviours .",
    "indeed , the functions are not linear but becoming more straighter for @xmath1 , and even more for the @xmath0 band head .",
    "another difference between the behaviour of the @xmath79 ratio and that of the excited band heads is the distinct effect of the stiffness parameter @xmath34 .",
    "the increase in stiffness for @xmath79 is reflected in a longer and more horizontal plateau defined up to the turning point above which the line goes abruptly to the @xmath3 value . as a matter of fact the height of the plateau seems to reach a certain saturation at higher values of the stiffness , the saturation maximal height being @xmath81 which is the @xmath82 rotational limit . in contradistinction ,",
    "the effect of the stiffness increase on the excited band heads produce an almost proportional increase for the corresponding function .    in what concerns the model s",
    "wave functions , these are identical with those of es-@xmath2 and @xmath3 when @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "but in the @xmath48 case the norm of the @xmath1 state is not the same as in the @xmath3 model due to the different metrics of the deformation space , _ i.e. _ the integration measure in the present case is @xmath72 in comparison to @xmath83 of the @xmath3 formalism . as a consequence of this fact , a reshaping of the @xmath1 probability distribution takes place .",
    "indeed , as can be seen from the upper panels of figure [ prob ] , while the probability peak in the @xmath3 case is positioned in the center of the square well , in the present model it is shifted to higher deformation and also becomes more pronounced . from the lower panels of figure [ prob ]",
    "one observes that this behaviour is perpetuated when going to smaller values of parameter @xmath76 , reaching at some point a stagnation in the position and hight of the peak which continues up to the es-@xmath2 limit .",
    "increasing the stiffness , the stagnation interval diminishes and the peak at @xmath47 is shifted to a higher @xmath1 deformation .",
    "this is the result of the centrifugal contribution from the @xmath0 dependent term of the potential ( [ pot ] ) which compresses the wave function to higher @xmath1 values as the stiffness of the @xmath0 vibration increases .",
    "such a behaviour of the @xmath1 wave function is very much similar to the @xmath1-rigid case @xcite . in conclusion ,",
    "the price to be paid when transforming @xmath0 from a simple parameter to a variable is the confinement of the ground state @xmath1 distribution probability at higher expectation values of the @xmath1 deformation .    an extensive search for nuclei which fall in the category described by the present model",
    "was made by means of model fits on rare earth and actinide isotopes with @xmath84 and with all three bands experimentally accounted .",
    "the quality of the fits was judged by the quantity    @xmath85^{2 } } , \\label{sigma}\\ ] ]    where @xmath86 is the theoretical energy defined by ( [ et ] ) with @xmath87 indexing angular momentum states from the ground , @xmath1 and @xmath0 bands .",
    "the experimental realization of our model was found to occur in @xmath88gd , @xmath89dy and @xmath90er isotopes . as can be deduced from table [ spec ] where the results of the fits are given in comparison to the available experimental data , the best agreement is obtained for @xmath88gd and @xmath89dy nuclei . for @xmath89dy",
    "one obtained the highest degree of mixing between @xmath0-rigid and @xmath0-stable rotation - vibration , judging by the rigidity value @xmath91 which is associated with a comparable weighting for the two competing excitations .",
    "the fits for the other two nuclei provide much higher values for @xmath76 , corresponding to prevalent @xmath0-rigid behaviour . especially high @xmath0-rigidity is obtained in case of @xmath88gd , which is damped by also high stiffness . taking into account the conclusions drawn from figure [ ratios ] , this high value for @xmath0 stiffness can be ascribed to near rotational behaviour in the ground band for this particular nucleus .",
    "although the spectral observables of @xmath88gd are quite far from the @xmath3 values , it can be considered as quasi-@xmath0-rigid in virtue of the high value of the rigidity parameter .",
    "the ground and @xmath0 bands of all nuclei are reproduced very well , with the @xmath1 band being the principal source of the discrepancy with experiment .",
    "the overestimation of the energy differences between consecutive @xmath1 band states is a common problem for the @xmath2 related models , which can be circumvented by considering smoothed out square well shapes for the @xmath1 potential @xcite . using a polynomial potential in the @xmath1 variable",
    "not only will be more natural from the geometrical symmetry perspective but will also attenuate the compression of the wave function against the outer potential wall which in our model is partially managed by increasing the rigidity @xmath76 .    in table [ tranz ] we compare the theoretical predictions for the @xmath9 transition rates computed with the values of @xmath76 and @xmath34 from table [ spec ] with few commonly available experimental data , which amount to ground - ground and @xmath0-ground transitions . in this way one can ascertain the agreement with experiment for both @xmath74 and @xmath92 transition probabilities . in the first case",
    "the agreement is very good even for high angular momentum states , while in later case the experimental values are slightly underestimated .",
    "the fact that the theoretical @xmath77 values vary very little between the considered nuclei is consistent with the presence of a stagnation interval in the @xmath1 transition probability density as function of @xmath76 ( see figure [ prob ] ) .",
    "it is instructive to compare our results also with the rigid rotor estimation of the @xmath9 transition probability @xcite : @xmath93 thus , the ground - ground transitions in the present calculations are overestimated in respect to the rigid rotor results , while the @xmath0-ground ones are almost identical .",
    "the last result is related to the quasi - rigid description of the @xmath0 degree of freedom .",
    "another common trait of the considered nuclei is the nearly rigid rotor values of the experimental @xmath79 ratio which is consistent with their high experimental quadrupole moments @xcite and microscopic mean - field calculations @xcite which also predict very sharp probability distributions for the @xmath1 deformation of these nuclei .",
    "this is actually one of the reasons why these nuclei were found to be the best representatives of the proposed model .",
    "indeed , the approximate @xmath1-rigid behaviour of the model due to the specific choice of the separated potential is in agreement with the experimental observations and the microscopic predictions regarding the ground state properties of these nuclei .",
    "another aspect which pleads in favor of the present description are the high values obtained for the stiffness parameter for all three nuclei , and especially for those closer to rigidity , which also validate the small angles approximation made here @xcite . the considered nuclei present however deviations from the rotational behaviour in the ground band when going to higher spin states",
    ". moreover , the @xmath1 and @xmath0 bands are not even remotely close to each other as it happens in the @xmath82 case where these bands are degenerated .",
    "the experimental @xmath9 transition probabilities for these three nuclei also deviate from the rigid rotor estimation as can be seen from table [ tranz ] .",
    "the microscopic calculations of @xcite also evidenced the so called centrifugal stretching phenomenon , _",
    "i.e. _ the increase of the average deformation with the angular momentum . as a mater of fact ,",
    "our model is able to describe this property due to the presence of the centrifugal term of the potential coming from the @xmath0 variable .",
    "this contribution shifts the inner wall of the @xmath1 square well potential , which in combination with the usual centrifugal term is responsible for the centrifugal stretching .",
    "a simplified picture of this mechanism is described in @xcite with the confined @xmath1-soft model @xcite .",
    "it must be mentioned here that the infinite square well shape adopted in our formalism is understood in the present context as a maximally anharmonic potential .",
    "its usefulness is justified also by the microscopic analysis @xcite regarding the @xmath94 excited states in the isotopic chains corresponding to the presently discussed nuclei .",
    "the results of @xcite point to the increase in @xmath1 anharmonicity as function of the neutron number , such that its stronger for the more deformed nuclei .",
    "it is interesting that the aforementioned study suggest that the highest @xmath1 anharmonicity corresponds to the nucleus @xmath88gd which happens to be the best experimental realisation of the present model .",

    "this choice is consistent with the requirement that in a critical point of a shape phase transition the potential must be flat or having multiple degenerated minima @xcite . with this choice",
    ", the @xmath1 part of the problem is brought to a bessel type equation . as a result , the model s energy spectrum and the @xmath9 transition probabilities depend on two parameters , excepting the scale .",
    "numerical applications showed that the energy spectrum at @xmath48 recovers the @xmath3 values regardless of the stiffness value .",
    "however , in the rest of the interval , the stiffness plays an important role in defining the excited band heads which are rising proportionally . on the other hand , its effect on the @xmath79 ratio has a saturation behaviour , tending to the rotational limit 3.33 at high values .",
    "taking into account the above considerations , the spectral characteristics of the present model can be succinctly described as @xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "it is needless to say that in the lower limit of the rigidity at @xmath47 the energy spectrum recovers the corresponding es-@xmath2 structure .",
    "although there are two free parameters , the present solution is as poor in candidate nuclei as @xmath2 critical point symmetry and its exactly solvable analog es-@xmath2 .",
    "this is actually a common trait for parameter independent critical point solutions . indeed , because the energy spectrum of nuclei change discretely with @xmath152 and @xmath153 , the critical point of phase transition can very well be missed in between two nuclei .",
    "moreover , the present model is based on the irrotational flow interpretation of the moments of inertia while it is well known @xcite that the actual moments of inertia lie in between these hydrodynamical realizations and the rigid ones . as a result ,",
    "the search for model candidates revealed only three nuclei with good agreement with experiment and a high degree of mixing between @xmath0 rigidity and stability .",
    "these are the @xmath10 isotones @xmath88gd and @xmath89dy together with @xmath90er nucleus which have 98 neutrons .",
    "considering the structure of the proposed model it is then not surprising to find its experimental realisations in the heavier and more deformed branches of isotopic chains undergoing shape phase transitions .",
    "the transitional region to which they belong is also known to exhibit level sequences of the collective spectrum with alternating parities which are understood as a consequence of the quadrupole - octupole coherent coupling @xcite .",
    "such that for a more realistic description of these nuclei the inclusion of at least octupole degrees of freedom is prerequisite .",
    "although the hexadecapole deformation induce irremediable complications it must not be completely neglected given the open possibility for the realization of octahedral discreet symmetry in even - even rare earth nuclei along with the tetrahedral one @xcite .    in what concerns numerical results ,",
    "the fits for @xmath89dy designate it more closer to the @xmath0-stable behavior , while for the other two the rigid excitations are stronger .",
    "moreover , @xmath88gd seems to be falling into the quasi-@xmath0-rigid category .",
    "also our model fit for the @xmath89gd nucleus , confirms it as a es-@xmath2 representative @xcite which in the present formalism amounts to @xmath47 . regarding the electromagnetic properties of these nuclei ,",
    "theoretical estimations show a good agreement with the available experimental @xmath77 values for @xmath74 as well as @xmath92 transitions . in both cases , one observes a very weak dependence on the two parameters .    because of the above - mentioned aspects one may say that the hybrid formalism proposed in this paper unveils alternative features of the collective motion in the vicinity of the critical point of a spherical to deformed shape phase transition . the combining scheme described in the previous sections",
    "can be extended also to quadrupole excitations closer to the critical point by considering a different @xmath1 potential , such as for example harmonic oscillator or davidson @xcite potentials .",
    "one expects that the predictive power of the model would increase based on a greater number of treatable nuclei with such potentials @xcite .",
