    "extending the calculation for thin f layer to arbitrary thickness of the layer and arbitrary transparency ( characterized by @xmath191 ) of the interface is quite straightforward when domain walls are large , as we show in the appendix .",
    "as it is well known , the behavior of the critical temperature of the transition into uniform superconducting state is quite rich in such case and may even oscillate as a function of the parameters such as @xmath33 or @xmath38 .",

    "dws was analyzed for s layers with thickness @xmath196 much smaller than coherence length @xmath7 .",
    "on the other hand , dws should not appear when the superconductor is hardly affected by proximity effect , at @xmath197 .",

    "in all the calculations we presented , there is no long range triplet component in the direction transverse to the wall either : the typical length for the superconducting gap is determined by conventional short range proximity effect with decay length @xmath201 .",
    "we would like to emphasize also that the @xmath11 enhancement due to the appearance of dws is maximized for narrow domain wall ( see sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] ) , when the matrix elements of the anomalous green s function that would give rise to long range triplet component are exactly zero .",
    "therefore , the physics of dws discussed here is not directly related to such phenomenon .",

    ", we analyzed in this work the enhancement of the superconducting critical temperature of superconducting / ferromagnetic bilayers due to the appearance of localized superconducting states in the vicinity of magnetic domain walls in the ferromagnet .",
    "we considered the case when the main mechanism of the superconductivity destruction via the proximity effect is the exchange field .",
    "we demonstrated that the influence of the domain walls on the superconducting properties of s layer may be quite strong if the domain wall thickness is of the order of superconducting coherence length .",
    "we interpreted qualitatively and quantitatively the amplitude of this effect , and we pointed out the special case when parameters of the bilayer are such that only localized superconductivity may form in these systems .    for magnetic film with perpendicular anisotropy , the orbital effect provides an additional mechanism for the domain wall superconductivity@xcite and it may be easily taken into account . on the other hand for the film with the easy plane magnetic anisotropy",
    "the domain wall will be a source of the magnetic field in the adjacent s layer and locally weakens the superconductivity.@xcite the role of the orbital mechanism in the domain wall superconductivity may be important only if the magnetic induction is comparable with the upper critical field of the superconducting film .",
    "the domain wall superconductivity in s / f bilayers opens an interesting way to manipulate the superconducting properties through the domain structure .",
    "in particular the motion of the domain wall in f layer may be accompanied by the displacement of the narrow superconducting region in s layer .",
    "we are grateful to j. aarts for attracting our attention to the problem of the domain wall superconductivity in s / f bilayers and useful discussions .",
    "as mentioned previously , @xmath46 is usually large in ferromagnets .",
    "therefore the condition of thin f layer , @xmath209 , is hardly reached .",
    "we would like to extend the results of the previous section to the more realistic situation of a finite size f layer .",
    "the difficulty is that the set of differential equations ( [ linear - usadel - s])-([selfconsistent - gap ] ) to be solved are now two - dimensional .",
    "we managed to solve it for the case of large domain wall only . in the f layer ,",
    "we parametrize the exchange field rotation with a slowly varying angle @xmath125 such as @xmath210 . linearized usadel equations ( linear - usadel - f ) in f layer",
