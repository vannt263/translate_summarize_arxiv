    "let me start with a warning : this is _ not _ a review of heavy quark physics .",
    "i have been honored by the divisin de partculas y campos of the sociedad mexicana de fsica with the medalla 2003 , for which i am grateful and humbled .",
    "this talk was given on occasion of the medal being conferred .",
    "i tried to describe , from my personal view point , how the field of @xmath2 physics evolved since its inception to the present , biased by my own experience .",
    "in november of 1974 two experimental collaborations announced the discovery of a new very narrow resonance with mass 3.1  gev .",
    "they had unearthed evidence for the charm quark , and for the validity of an asymptotically free theory , like qcd , for strong interactions .",
    "these events had extraordinary consequences , affecting the way we think today about particle physics .",
    "they are often referred to as the `` november revolution '' .",
    "a mit  brookhaven collaboration , led by s.  ting , found evidence for the new resonance by measuring the @xmath3 mass spectrum in @xmath4 with a precise pair spectrometer at brookhaven natl .",
    "lab.s 30  gev ags@xcite .",
    "the mark  i collaboration , from slac and lbl , led by b. richter was conducting experiments at the newly constructed @xmath3 ring , spear , at slac .",
    "their detector consisted of a spark chamber embedded in a solenoidal magnetic field , and surrounded by time - of - flight counters , shower counters and proportional counters embedded in slabs of iron for muon identification .",
    "they@xcite `` observed a very sharp peak in the cross sections for @xmath5  hadrons , @xmath3 , and @xmath6 at a center of mass energy of @xmath7  gev '' and found an upper bound on the width of 1.3  mev .",
    "the mit - bnl collaboration called the new resonance `` j '' , mark  i called it `` @xmath8 '' , so it s now known as the @xmath9 .",
    "the mark  i collaboration soon found a second narrow resonance@xcite , the @xmath10 , at a mass of 3.695@xmath110.004  gev .",
    "no other narrow resonances were found in the total @xmath3 cross sections at spear , but broader structures did appear at energies above the @xmath10@xcite .",
    "other narrow structures that could not be directly produced in @xmath3 collisions were found through cascade decays of the @xmath10 .",
    "the dasp collaboration working at desy s @xmath3 storage ring doris found@xcite the first @xmath12 state in @xmath13 .",
    "the crystal ball collaboration@xcite detector provided the high spatial and energy resolution needed to finally unravel the spectroscopic levels of charmonium .",
    "the interpretation of these resonances soon became clear : they are atom - like bound states of a charm quark - antiquark pair .",
    "the interaction between the rather heavy quarks is coulomb like , since at short distances qcd becomes weak and a single gluon exchange gives an attractive coulomb potential between the quarks .",
    "the potential is not really coulomb : for one thing , it must be confining so it must grow without bound at long distances .",
    "but the physics of the spectrum of bound states is dominated by the short distance interaction and is not dissimilar from the physics of the hydrogen atom . the @xmath14 and",
    "@xmath8 families are in a quark - spin singlet and triplet state , respectively , with orbital angular momentum  0 , giving @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are in a spin triplet , with @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "charmonium states have zero charm number , @xmath23 .",
    "states with @xmath24 , with so called `` naked charm '' , were first convincingly observed by mark  i at spear@xcite .",
    "they observed narrow peaks in the invariant mass spectra for neutral combinations of charged particles in @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "they inferred the existence of an object of mass @xmath27  mev and put an upper limit on its width of 40  mev .",
    "the new state , with @xmath28 , was the @xmath29 pseudoscalar meson .",
    "they found `` it significant that the threshold energy for pair - producing this state lies in the small interval between the very narrow @xmath10 and the broader  '' @xmath30 .",
    "that is , the @xmath30 is much broader because it decays strongly into a @xmath31@xmath32 pair .      the discovery of `` naked bottom '' ( or `` naked beauty '' , outside the americas ) paralleled in many ways that of charm .",
    "although a new sequential heavy lepton , the @xmath33 , had been discovered , and therefore the existence of beauty and top expected , the masses of these quarks were unknown .",
    "l.  lederman led a collaboration at fermilab that used a two arm spectrometer to search for muon pairs in 400  gev proton - nucleus collisions .",
    "they had some experience .",
    "years earlier the group conducted a similar experiment at bnl s ags . because their apparatus had smaller resolution than that of the mit - bnl group , they did not report any evidence for a resonance .",
    "they had seen a cross section that , except for a small plateau in the 3  gev region , fell with invariant mass as expected .",
    "after missing the @xmath9 , they were ready for the discovery of bottomonium .",
    "they observed@xcite a similar effect in the new experiment , and correctly interpreted it as a dimuon resonance at about 9.5  gev .",
    "a refined analysis of the experiment revealed actually two peaks , at 9.44 and 10.17  gev .",
    "the states were named `` @xmath34 '' and `` @xmath35 '' .",
    "an upgrade of the energy of doris made it possible for the pluto and dasp  ii collaborations to observe the @xmath34 in @xmath3 annihilation@xcite .",
    "a further energy upgrade made the @xmath35 accessible too@xcite .",
    "after the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) was commissioned , the cusb and cleo collaborations successfully observed the @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "all three resonances , with masses 9.460 , 10.023 and 10.355  gev are narrow . shortly afterwards the two collaborations established the existence of a broader resonance , the @xmath37 , at a mass of @xmath38  gev and a width of about  @xmath39  mev .",
    "this is significant because , following the charm experience , it suggests looking for naked beauty in the decay of @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath2-mesons were first found and reported by the cleo collaboration in a paper which for once is straight and to the point in its title ( `` observation of exclusive decay modes of @xmath1-flavored mesons '' ) and in its abstract ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . to be sure ,",
    "@xmath2-mesons had been inferred from the observation of high momentum leptons in @xmath37 decays , but it was the reconstruction of a few exclusive decays that demonstrated their existence conclusively . today @xmath31 and @xmath2 mesons are universally accepted established resonances .",
    "they are the closest we can get to having naked charm and beauty .",
    "their masses have been measured to high accuracy@xcite : @xmath40",
    "one of the first surprises encountered in the early 80 s was the long lifetime of naked @xmath2 .",
    "the 1984 pdg review of particle properties@xcite gives : @xmath41 the @xmath42 and @xmath43 lifetimes are not separated .",
    "the @xmath2 lifetime is _ longer _ than the @xmath31 lifetime . since naively @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is a phase space suppression factor",
    ", one has to conclude that both @xmath46 and @xmath47 are small : @xmath48 moreover , already the 1984 pdg review listed the decay branching fraction into charmed final states as @xmath49% , implying that @xmath50 so that the above estimate gives @xmath51 .",
    "unitarity of the ckm matrix requires @xmath52 .",
    "there was a quantum leap in understanding of the texture of the ckm matrix : it became evident that it has 1 s along the diagonal , numbers of order 0.1 off the diagonal , and very likely much smaller than 0.1 two steps removed from the diagonal .",
    "the rule of thumb was ( and still is ) @xmath53 . in what used to be the standard parametrization of the ckm matrix in terms of angles @xmath54 and @xmath55 , this meant that all angles are of the order of 0.1 .",
    "the origin of this texture remains a mystery , and a challenge to model builders .",
    "+ fig .  1    how can we progress from an estimate of the ckm angles to a precision measurement ?",
    "this is an example of a story that repeats itself over and over in the study of heavy quarks : experiment and theory have to work together to find a route to the answer of this question .",
    "experimentally it would be easiest to measure with great precision the lifetime of the @xmath2 meson , but theorists did not have ( nor do they have today ) a complete theory of lifetimes .",
    "theory prefers inclusive widths of semileptonic decays , but experimental backgrounds make this a tough , if not impossible measurement , particularly when restricting to non - charm final states as is necessary for the determination of @xmath56 .",
    "the difficulty with the charm background is easily grasped from fig .  1 , which shows data from cleo@xcite and argus@xcite superimposed on model calculations ( see below ) of the semileptonic decay spectrum into c- and u - quarks , assuming @xmath57 .     + fig .  2    not knowing how to calculate the decay rate from first principles",
    ", theorists resorted to reasonable guesses , or `` hadron models . '' the gsw model@xcite , and later incarnations as the isgw@xcite and isgw - ii@xcite models , was simply an application of the quark - potential model of hadrons to the computation of matrix elements of @xmath58 charged currents between an initial @xmath2 meson state and a final state consisting of a single meson with either a charm quark ( for @xmath46 ) or a u - quark ( for @xmath47 ) .",
    "it was reassuring that adding over a few final state charmed mesons , the semi - inclusive decay rate into charm gives approximately the same answer as the free quark decay rate .",
    "fig .  2 shows how the individual charmed resonances add up .",
    "3    in order to determine @xmath47 the charm background has to be controlled .",
    "a favorite experimental method was to measure the inclusive semileptonic decay spectrum as a function of the readily measurable electron ( or muon ) energy , and to focus on energies large enough that decay into charm is forbidden .",
    "the calculation of gsw , fig .",
    "3 , showed that the rate in the restricted region is dominated by a few final state resonances which are only a fraction of the total semi - inclusive rate as calculated directly at the parton level ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "this suggested that the parton level calculation is highly unreliable in the end - point region .",
    "moreover , the result of summing over a few resonances had a different shape and end - point than the partonic result . and , as if not enough , the model computation was fairly sensitive to the choice of model parameters .",
    "ouch !     + fig .  4",
    "the standard model predicts @xmath60 oscillations , much in the same way as for @xmath61 . the underlying weak process is well known .",
    "since mixing requires a change of @xmath1-number by two units , there must be two @xmath62 exchanged , and the process is doubly - weak .",
    "the amplitude is given by the `` box '' feynman diagram of fig .",
    "4 . keeping track of the ckm factors from both fermion lines in the box diagram , one has @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a function that arises from computing the one loop graph . if the three intermediate quarks were",
    "degenerate the amplitude would vanish identically since the ckm matrix is unitary : @xmath65 .",
    "expanding @xmath64 in the quark masses we have , @xmath66 since each of the factors @xmath67 involves a jump of two generations , the rule of thumb of the previous sections says that all these are similar ( and of order @xmath68 ) , @xmath69 it follows immediately that the top quark gives the dominant contribution to the mixing amplitude in eq .",
    "( [ eq : box2 ] ) .    in the absence of mixing",
    ", a @xmath60 pair produced in an @xmath3 collision will produce opposite charged leptons when both @xmath2 s decay semileptonicaly .",
    "mixing implies that some fraction of the time the two semileptonic decays produce the same charge leptons.the argus collaboration discovered this phenomenon and reported@xcite @xmath70 the rate of mixing is given by the amplitude above times @xmath71 , which characterizes the matrix element , times some fixed numbers ( including short distance qcd corrections ) . to explain this rather large mixing within the standard model of electroweak interactions we could assume @xmath71 was larger than estimated . but even taking rather extreme values for @xmath71 ( corresponding to more than four times",
    "the modern accepted value ! ) , and taking @xmath72 as large as possible , we were forced to require a large top quark mass , in excess of 50  gev .",
    "5    in 1987 the direct bound on the mass of the top quark was 15  gev .",
    "it was expected that the @xmath73-quark would be much lighter than the @xmath74 , a reasonable guess given the masses of all other quarks .",
    "the evidence from @xmath75 mixing was that the top quark was much heavier , possibly heavier than the @xmath74 .",
    "this had immediate , surprising implications .",
    "for one , the gim mechanism is a bit of a fluke .",
    "take for example the prediction of the mass of the charm quark .",
    "gim cancellations bring in a suppression factor of @xmath76 , as can be seen by adapting the result in eq .",
    "( [ eq : box2 ] ) to the case of @xmath77 mixing .",
    "the top quark contribution is not suppressed by @xmath78 simply because this factor exceeds unity .",
    "in fact , for the top quark it makes no sense to approximate the function @xmath64 in ( [ eq : box1 ] ) by the expansion in ( [ eq : box2 ] ) .",
    "the top contribution to @xmath61 mixing involves @xmath79 .",
    "this is a three generation jump , as compared to the single jump for the charm contribution , so we get a suppression factor of @xmath68 .",
    "but , by comparison , the charm contribution is suppressed by @xmath80 .",
    "6    a second implication is that processes mediated by virtual top - quarks may have larger rates than we had thought by 1987 .",
    "the first such process you would think of is the radiative decay , @xmath81 .",
    "the lowest order feynman diagram is the one loop graph shown in fig .",
    "this gives an effective hamiltonian for the radiative decay @xmath82 here we have neglected the contribution of @xmath83 and @xmath0 quarks , and @xmath84 is a function of the top quark mass plotted in fig .",
    "6 as a function of @xmath85 .",
    "short distance qcd corrections enhance the amplitude by about 70% , so the rate is enhanced by a full factor of three ; see fig .  7 .",
    "the reason the qcd corrections are so large is that the function @xmath84 in ( [ eq : heffbtosgamma ] ) is accidentally small .",
    "the qcd corrections are suppressed by the strong coupling constant but enhanced by large logarithms .",
    "resumming large logarithms of the ratio of @xmath86 to @xmath87 or @xmath88 ( assuming @xmath88 is the same scale as @xmath87 ) has the effect of replacing @xmath84 in ( [ eq : heffbtosgamma])@xcite : @xmath89 \\right.\\\\ \\left .",
    "+ \\frac{3a}{28}\\left [ \\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s(m_b)}{\\alpha_s(m_w)}\\right)^{\\frac{28}{23}}-1\\right ] \\right\\}.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] here @xmath90 ( @xmath91 for the case of @xmath92 ) .",
    "7    this is another interesting gim fluke .",
    "when we first computed these qcd corrections we thought they would dominate because gim gives an amplitude with a suppression of @xmath78 , while our qcd correction would involve this ratio logarithmically . with @xmath93 this argument",
    "does not hold water , but remarkably the qcd logarithmic `` corrections '' are still the dominant contribution , because the function @xmath84 is small .",
    "remarkably , the prediction we made in 1987 has changed little by theory refinements and higher order calculations@xcite .",
    "the reason is that @xmath94 is sufficiently small that perturbation theory works rather well .",
    "radiative @xmath2 decays are interesting because they proceed only at one loop in the standard model .",
    "therefore , new physics at short distances may in principle compete favorably with the standard model contribution to the process .",
    "to get an idea of how sensitive to new physics the process is we@xcite chose to explore one of the simplest extensions of the standard model , namely , a multi - higgs model .",
    "consider an extension of the standard model with two higgs doublets . in order to naturally suppress flavor changing neutral currents@xcite",
    "it is customary to impose a symmetry so that all quarks receive their mass from yukawa couplings to only one of the two higgs doublets ( `` model i '' ) , or so that all charge  @xmath95 quarks get their masses from one higgs doublet and the charge  @xmath96 quarks get their masses from the other ( `` model ii '' ) .",
    "model ii is similar to the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model , so it has received more attention .",
    "it is easy to see that the rate @xmath97 is strictly larger in model  ii than in the standard model .",
    "figure  8 show the rate in model  ii as a function of @xmath88 for a charged higgs mass of 100  gev and with equal expectation values of the two higgs doubles ( @xmath98 ) . comparing with fig .",
    "7 we see that the standard model rate is several times smaller . since experiment is consistent with the standard model to within 20% , the mass of the charged higgs in model  ii has to be much larger than 100  gev .",
    "the same is true in minimal supersymmetry , with the caveat that a light higgs is allowed if one fine tunes additional contributions ( like higgsinos running in the loop ) to cancel the charged higgs graph .     + fig .",
    "8    many other processes are enhanced by a large top quark mass .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .  9@xcite , which compares the predicted lepton mass spectrum in the decay @xmath99 , in units of the semileptonic decay rate , for @xmath100  gev ( lower curve ) and 150  gev ( higher curve ) .",
    "+ fig .  9",
    "it did not escape the attention of many that the quark model prediction of the inclusive decay rate , shown in fig .  2 , is dominated by the lowest two charmed states : the @xmath31 and @xmath101 mesons .",
    "nussinov and wetzel@xcite emphasized that this calculation has nothing to do with the details of the quark model used .",
    "they argued that the @xmath31 , @xmath101 and @xmath2 wavefunctions are the same , so that when the @xmath31 or @xmath101 mesons are not recoiling in the decay the amplitude is given by the overlap of identical wave - functions which is fixed to unity for normalized wave - functions .",
    "moreover , the higher resonances have wavefunctions that are orthogonal to these , so clearly their contributions are small .",
    "the nussinov - wetzel argument relied on the quark - model picture that the meson is a two body system with a potential binding .",
    "since the @xmath1 and @xmath0 are heavy , the reduced mass ( which governs all the dynamics ) is the same for both @xmath31 and @xmath2 mesons .",
    "moreover , the heavy spin decouples , since the coupling arises from the magnetic moment which scales inversely with the large mass . so the wavefunction for the @xmath101 agrees with that of the @xmath31 .    if this were true in qcd then one could begin a program of precision ckm determination .",
    "enter hqet .",
    "heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) is a calculational method that exploits enhanced symmetries of qcd that appear when one restricts attention to a very specific sector of the theory .",
    "i stress that hqet _ is _ qcd .",
    "this is in contrast with hadronic models , like the quark potential model , which had been used to calculate form factors for heavy meson decays .",
    "the successes of the constituent quark model is indicative of the fact that , inside hadrons , strongly bound quarks exchange momentum of magnitude a few hundred mev .",
    "we can think of the typical amount @xmath102 by which the quarks are off  shell in the nucleon as @xmath103  mev . in a heavy hadron",
    "the same intuition can be imported , and again the light quark(s ) is(are ) very far off  shell , by an amount of order @xmath102 .",
    "but , if the mass @xmath104 of the heavy quark @xmath105 is large , @xmath106 , then , in fact , this quark is almost on  shell .",
    "moreover , interactions with the light quark(s ) typically change the momentum of @xmath105 by @xmath102 , but change the _ velocity _ of @xmath105 by a negligible amount , of the order of @xmath107 .",
    "it therefore makes sense to think of @xmath105 as moving with constant velocity , and this velocity is , of course , the velocity of the heavy hadron .    in the rest frame of the heavy hadron ,",
    "the heavy quark is practically at rest .",
    "the heavy quark effectively acts as a static source of gluons .",
    "it is characterized by its flavor and color@xmath108 quantum numbers , but not by its mass .",
    "in fact , since spin  flip interactions with @xmath105 are of the type of magnetic moment transitions , and these involve an explicit factor of @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the strong interactions coupling constant , the spin quantum number itself decouples in the large @xmath104 case .",
    "therefore , _ the properties of heavy hadrons are independent of the spin and mass of the heavy source of color .",
    "_    the hqet is nothing more than a method for giving these observations a formal basis .",
    "it is useful because it gives a procedure for making explicit calculations .",
    "but more importantly , it turns the statement ` @xmath104 is large ' into a _ systematic _ perturbative expansion in powers of @xmath111 .",
    "each order in this expansion involves qcd to all orders in the strong coupling , @xmath110 .",
    "also , the statement of mass and spin independence of properties of heavy hadrons appears in the hqet as approximate internal symmetries of the lagrangian .",
    "we shall focus our attention on the calculation of green functions in qcd , with a heavy quark line , its external momentum almost on  shell .",
    "the external momentum of gluons or light quarks can be far off  shell , but not much larger than the hadronic scale @xmath102 .",
    "this region of momentum space is interesting because physical quantities @xmath112matrix elements live there . and ,",
    "as stated in the introduction , we expect to see approximate symmetries of green functions in that region which are not symmetries away from it",
    ". that is , these are approximate symmetries of a sector of the @xmath112matrix , but not of the full qcd lagrangian .",
    "the effective lagrangian @xmath113 is constructed so that it will reproduce these green functions , to leading order in @xmath111 .",
    "it is given , for a heavy quark of velocity @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) , by@xcite , @xmath116 where the covariant derivative is @xmath117 and the heavy quark field @xmath118 is a dirac spinor that satisfies the constraint @xmath119 in addition , it is understood that the usual lagrangian @xmath120 for gluons and light quarks is added to @xmath121 .",
    "we have introduced an effective lagrangian @xmath121 such that green functions @xmath122 calculated from it agree , at tree level , with corresponding green functions @xmath123 in qcd to leading order in the large mass @xmath124 here , @xmath102 stands for any component of @xmath125 or of the @xmath126 s , or for a light quark mass , and @xmath127 .",
    "it is straightforward to verify eq .",
    "( [ eiiv ] ) .    beyond tree level",
    "the corrected version is still close in form to this@xcite , @xmath128 the green functions @xmath129 and @xmath130 are renormalized , so they depend on a renormalization point @xmath131 .",
    "the function @xmath23 is independent of momenta or light quark masses : it is independent of the dynamics of the light degrees of freedom .",
    "it is there because the left hand side has some terms which grow logarithmically with the heavy mass , @xmath132 .",
    "the beauty of eq .",
    "( [ eiivi ] ) is that _ all of the logarithmic dependence on the heavy mass factors out .",
    "_ better yet , since @xmath23 is dimensionless , it is a function of the ratio @xmath133 only , and not of @xmath104 and @xmath131 separately .",
    "( actually , additional @xmath131 dependence is implicit in the definition of the renormalized coupling constant @xmath110 .",
    "this reflects itself in the explicit form of @xmath23 ) . to find the dependence on @xmath104 it suffices to find the dependence on @xmath131",
    "this in turn is dictated by the renormalization group equation .",
    "it is appropriate to think of the hqet as a factorization theorem , stating that , in the large @xmath104 limit , the qcd green functions factorize into a universal function of @xmath104 , @xmath134 , which depends on the short distance physics only , times a function that contains all of the information about long distance physics and is independent of @xmath104 , and can be computed as a green function of the hqet lagrangian .",
    "the lagrangian for @xmath135 species of heavy quarks , all with velocity @xmath136 , is @xmath137 this lagrangian has a @xmath138 symmetry@xcite .",
    "the subgroup @xmath139 corresponds to flavor conservation of the strong interactions , and was a good symmetry in the original theory .",
    "the novelty in the hqet is then the non - abelian nature of the symmetry group .",
    "this leads to relations between properties of heavy hadrons with different quantum numbers .",
    "please note that these will be relations between hadrons of a given velocity , even if of different momentum ( since typically @xmath140 for @xmath141 ) .",
    "including the @xmath1 and @xmath0 quarks in the hqet , so that @xmath142 , we see that the @xmath2 and @xmath31 mesons form a doublet under flavor@xmath143 .",
    "flavor@xmath143 _ is an approximate symmetry of qcd .",
    "it is a good symmetry to the extent that @xmath144 these conditions can be met even if @xmath145 .",
    "this is in contrast to isospin symmetry , which holds because @xmath146 .    in atomic physics",
    "this symmetry implies the equality of chemical properties of different isotopes of an element .    _",
    "spin  @xmath143 : _ the hqet lagrangian involves only two components of the spinor @xmath147 .",
    "recall that @xmath148 the two surviving components enter the lagrangian diagonally , _",
    "i.e. _ , there are no dirac matrices in @xmath149 in eq .",
    "( [ eiii ] ) . therefore , there is an @xmath143 symmetry of this lagrangian which rotates the two components of @xmath147 among themselves@xcite .",
    "please note that this `` spin''symmetry is actually an _ internal _ symmetry .",
    "that is , for the symmetry to hold no transformation on the coordinates is needed , when a rotation among components of @xmath147 is made . on the other hand , to recover lorentz covariance , one does the usual transformation on the light  sector , including a lorentz transformation of coordinates and in addition a lorentz transformation on the velocity @xmath150 .",
    "a spin@xmath143 transformation can be added to this procedure , to mimic the original action of lorentz transformations .",
    "the symmetries in hqet are sufficient to give us the matrix elements for semileptonic @xmath2 decay in terms of one undetermined `` isgur - wise '' function @xmath151 : @xmath152.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] moreover , the isgur - wise function satisfies a normalization condition , @xmath153 .",
    "it is easy to see where this comes from .",
    "the forward scattering amplitude of the @xmath2 meson by the @xmath1-current , @xmath154 , is normalized by charge conservation ( just like electromagnetic charge form factors ) .",
    "an hq - flavor @xmath143 transformation relates this to the first matrix element in ( [ eq - iw ] ) and a further hq - spin @xmath143 transformation relates it to the second line in ( [ eq - iw ] ) .",
    "this is remarkable : six unknown form factors are given in terms of one , which , in addition , is known at one kinematic point !    a remarkable theorem by luke@xcite states that even after including corrections of order @xmath155 some form factors are still normalized .",
    "the remaining irreducible uncertainty in the determination of @xmath156 is of order @xmath157 , so this should give a determination with precision of a few per - cent .",
    "the measurement is complicated by the fact that the decay rate vanishes at @xmath158 , so the measurement needs to be extrapolated .",
    "fortunately , qcd restricts significantly the extrapolation@xcite so little uncertainty is introduced .",
    "quark - hadron duality , the imprecise statement that a quantity can be computed directly at the parton level if it is inclusive enough and the energy involved is large enough , had long been thought to hold for decay rates of heavy mesons .",
    "however , in fact , the statement @xmath159 with @xmath160 or @xmath0 , is generally not correct .",
    "but if we smear over the electron energy things work out@xcite : @xmath161 where the smearing is defined by @xmath162 with @xmath163 a smooth function .",
    "the result is obtained by simultaneous short distance ( ope ) and heavy quark mass expansions of a green s function , the physical rate given by its imaginary part ( discontinuity across the cut ) .",
    "one therefore gets , in addition , a means for systematically improving the expansion , order by order in @xmath164 .",
    "we have indicated this in eq .",
    "( [ eq : duality ] ) , which shows the remarkable result@xcite that there are no corrections at first order in @xmath164 . moreover , by choosing the function @xmath163",
    "appropriately one can find new sum rules .",
    "these allow , for example , experimental determination of the unknown parameters that appear at order @xmath165@xcite by computing moments of the spectrum@xcite",
    ".      for semileptonic decays to charm we have seen that our theoretical understanding of both exclusive and inclusive widths is solid . at the time of the colima conference hfag was quoting remarkable agreement in the determination of @xmath46 by both means : @xmath166 the updated results can be found in hfag s website@xcite .",
    "the prospect of making a precise determination of @xmath56 is not as bright .",
    "there is no simple way of determining the form factors .",
    "one can either rely on the prospect of future precise lattice computations , or on using symmetry to fix the form factors indirectly",
    ". it may be possible to determine @xmath56 to few per - cent accuracy by comparing the rates for @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 and @xmath170@xcite .",
    "the endpoint of the electron / muon energy spectrum in @xmath171 can not be reliably described theoretically : the ope / hqet expansion breaks down ( not enough smearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : duality ] ) .",
    "one may limit the charm contamination by restricting other kinematic variables .",
    "decay to charm is not allowed for final state hadronic invariant mass @xmath172 , or for final state lepton pair invariant mass square @xmath173 .",
    "the best method will most likely involve carving out a region of @xmath174 _ vs _ @xmath175 space that minimizes theoretical errors while keeping the charm background under control@xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , factorization in @xmath176 means that the following holds , @xmath177 and can be tested experimentally by comparing @xmath178 and @xmath179 at @xmath180 .",
    "factorization holds in the large @xmath181 expansion of qcd to leading order in @xmath182 , but this explanation of factorization is a bit too democratic : it gives that factorization holds with the same accuracy for light meson decays , where it is known to fail badly .",
    "bjorken suggested@xcite that factorization may hold by color transparency .",
    "one can quantify and systematize bjorken s ideas by showing that factorization holds to all orders in qcd perturbation theory .",
    "one needs to find a proper expansion parameter such that in leading order gluons originating from the @xmath183 system do not couple to the @xmath184 system",
    ".    one can easily accomplish this@xcite .",
    "the idea is to expand in the large energy , @xmath185 , released to the light meson .",
    "we treat @xmath1 and @xmath0 as heavy quarks , expanding in @xmath164 while keeping @xmath186 fixed",
    ". then the energy @xmath187 scales with @xmath86 while the relativistic @xmath188-factor of the recoiling @xmath31 meson is fixed and small , @xmath189\\approx1.6 $ ] .",
    "since the velocity of the recoiling @xmath31 is small , the spectator quark ( the light quark bound in the @xmath2 meson ) only requires a soft kick to be incorporated into the final @xmath31 meson .",
    "the two light quarks from the @xmath74-vector - boson of the weak interaction must produce a single light meson .",
    "so the @xmath190 quark pair is produced with large energy and low invariant mass .",
    "this means they travel in the same light - like direction , and therefore their color charge cancels .",
    "this can be made quantitatively precise by introducing an effective theory that systematizes an expansion in @xmath191 .",
    "the leet@xcite is an effective theory that includes the interactions of soft gluons with the relativistic low mass quark - antiquark pair .",
    "decoupling of the pair from soft gluons is trivial to show in the leet .",
    "hard gluons do not decouple , but their effects are suppressed by @xmath94 , so corrections to factorization come in both at order @xmath191 and @xmath94 .",
    "this argument misses the possible effects of collinear gluons , but these are easily incorporated in scet , an effective theory with both soft and collinear gluons@xcite .",
    "the leet / scet justification for factorization in @xmath176 is interesting in several respects .",
    "first , it is patently different from large @xmath181 arguments .",
    "it applies only to decays of a heavy meson to a heavy meson plus a light one .",
    "this is good .",
    "empirically , factorization does not hold in @xmath31 decays",
    ". it does not hold in decays of @xmath2 to two light mesons , but this case is complicated by the presence of penguins . in leet",
    "/ scet factorization the spectator quark needs only a soft kick to join the final state .",
    "when the final state has two light mesons the spectator quark needs a hard kick , but hard kicks break factorization ( in the sense of eq .",
    "( [ eq : factorization ] ) above ) .",
    "to be sure , there is a factorizable contribution to the amplitude , but it is by no means dominant .",
    "second , although the argument was inspired by bjorken s color transparency ideas , it is by no means equivalent .",
    "not only does the effective theory provide a systematic approach to the study of factorization ( or rather , to violations to factorization ) but also it does not justify factorization in some processes for which color transparency applies , like @xmath192 . and third , it is predictive and therefore testable .",
    "for example , it predicts that the whole amplitude for @xmath193 is suppressed by the amount by which factorization is violated , @xmath194 experimentally , @xmath195 in agreement with expectations .",
    "leet / scet factorization in @xmath196 holds provided the hadronic system @xmath197 has small invariant mass .",
    "this is verified experimentally in the case when @xmath197 is a single resonance , @xmath198 .",
    "as the invariant mass of @xmath197 increases and eventually scales with @xmath86 the leet / scet argument fails .",
    "this could be tested with @xmath197 a multi - pion final state , by measuring the rate as a function of its invariant mass , @xmath174@xcite .",
    "there is evidence that factorization holds even as a function of @xmath174@xcite .",
    "there is no convincing explanation for this .",
    "time and space limitations preclude me from discussing other subjects which are very interesting .",
    "i would like to at least mention two of them :    _ quark - hadron duality : _ i explained above how quark - hadron duality works in semileptonic decays .",
    "there is no analogous treatment for purely hadronic decays and hence for lifetimes .",
    "the problem is that there is no external kinematic variable that allows us to consider a green function , rather than a decay rate .",
    "the green function can be studied at non - physical momenta and is amenable to an ope . in the absence of an ope",
    "we are left with educated guesses .",
    "we can study the question in soluble models . in @xmath199",
    "qcd in the large @xmath181 limit one can compute exactly the total width of a heavy meson .",
    "it is found that generally the width ( and hence the lifetime ) differs from the local quark - hadron duality prediction at order @xmath164@xcite , to be contrasted with the @xmath165 corrections in the semileptonic case .",
    "moreover and also in contrast with the semileptonic case , there is no systematic theory of these corrections .",
    "_ cp violation : _ the effort to precisely determine the elements of the ckm matrix complements the measurement of the angles of the unitarity triangle through cp violating asymmetries at @xmath2-factories .",
    "the idea is to over - constrain the triangle in an effort to ferret out any hint of new physics hiding under the surface .",
    "bigi and sanda observed that cp asymmetries through the interference of mixing and decay of neutral @xmath2 mesons to states that are cp eigenstates determine unitarity angles cleanly , without contamination from unknown hadronic matrix elements@xcite .",
    "this works extremely well for determinations of @xmath200 through , for example , @xmath201 .",
    "one of the challenges of modern and future @xmath2 factories is to determine @xmath202 and @xmath188 as well .",
    "a very unwelcome surprise came several year after bigi and sanda s ground - breaking paper when it was first realized that the determination of @xmath203 in , say , @xmath204 , could be compromised by unknown hadronic matrix elements because the effects of penguin diagrams could be significant@xcite .",
    "_ conclusions .",
    "i learned about the discovery of charm , the third generation of leptons and then of @xmath1 quarks from scientific american articles when i was in high school and then in college .",
    "it has been a fabulous opportunity to contribute to the understanding of these beasts throughout the time over which this field has evolved .",
    "the story is similar to that of electroweak - physics , and one could say that the @xmath2 meson is to ckm as the @xmath205 vector - boson is to the sm . with the big caveat that @xmath2 physics is still furiously evolving and may still hold some surprises .",
