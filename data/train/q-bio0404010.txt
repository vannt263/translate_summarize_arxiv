    "dna is a structure containing a long sequence of complimentary pairing bases , denoted by the symbol set @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the genetic material in dna undergoes a variety of different mutational events  @xcite .",
    "these mutational events can be considered as string rewriting rules  @xcite that lead to correlations in dna .",
    "repeated use of short sequences as promoters  @xcite , or as intron markers  @xcite can give rise to very long - range correlations .",
    "a number of different techniques have been studied for examining long range correlations in dna .",
    "these include lvy walks  @xcite , fourier transforms  @xcite , and wavelets  @xcite .",
    "a number of people have attempted to explore this by considering power law relationships in power spectra of dna sequences .",
    "this purports to show long - range correlations and also to show differences between regions of dna . in this paper",
    "we examine long - range correlations with mutual information techniques  @xcite , and briefly explore the higuchi fractal method  @xcite .",
    "dna sequences contain a number of coding regions .",
    "these are regions that code for protein and are marked with a stop and start codons ( but the presence of these does not necessarily indicate a coding region ) .",
    "coding regions may contain introns , which are regions that get spliced ( cut ) out before translation from the rna template before the protein is made according to the code on the rna template ( which in turn comes from the dna ) .",
    "non - coding regions may just be junk , or may code for regulatory rnas  @xcite , such as the xist gene which switches off the extra x chromosome in women  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show that these long - range correlations exist for real sequences of dna and virtual sequences of dna , but not random sequences of dna .",
    "the virtual sequences of dna are those produced by our software , which simulates a variety of mutational events .",
    "the random dna has a random sequence generated in software , so it should contain almost no correlations .",
    "we also explore whether or not the power spectra show any differences between coding and non - coding dna , and between different species of bacteria .",
    "for exploring correlations at very large distances , we used _ homo sapiens _",
    "chromosome 20  @xcite , _ mus musculus _ chromosome 2  @xcite and _ escherechia coli _",
    "@xcite .      in order to compare correlations in real dna with those in short random and short virtual dna sequences , we chose a selection of twenty short , real gene sequences from various organisms .",
    "their accession numbers , and descriptions are shown in table  [ real ] .",
    ".these are the genbank  @xcite accession numbers and descriptions of the twenty short , real mrna sequences used . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ reswg ]",
    "we found long - range correlations present in short sequences of real dna , `` virtual '' dna , and throughout whole chromosomes .",
    "our simulation of genetic mutation events in `` junk '' dna with fill , copy , and mutate operations also produces long range - correlations approaching 1024 bases in length .",
    "our negative test , with computer generated random sequences , succeeds in that we do not find any significant long - range correlations .",
    "these results confirm that mutational events in non - conserved regions of dna can give rise to long - range correlations .",
    "we acknowledge the funding provided by the university of adelaide .",
