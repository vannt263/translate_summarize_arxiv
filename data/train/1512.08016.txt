    "macdonald symmetric functions are orthogonal functions with many good properties and applications to various fields .",

    "their @xmath1-deformations are dualities between the deformed virasoro / w algebra or the ding - iohara - miki algebra @xcite and 5-dimensional gauge theories . in the simplest case ,",
    "the norm of the whittaker vector of the deformed virasoro algebra coincides with the nekrasov formula for the 5-dimensional pure gauge theory @xcite .",
    "the deformed virasoro algebra is very closely related to macdonald functions .",
    "the singular vectors of its highest weight representation correspond to macdonald functions with rectangular young diagrams @xcite . the whittaker vector can be explicitly written in terms of macdonald functions @xcite . moreover , as one of the indication of agt correspondence , there exists an good orthogonal basis called aflt basis @xcite , by which conformal blocks can be expanded so that their each factor reproduce nekrasov factor .",
    "the aflt basis in the case of 5d agt conjectures is in the representation space of the ding - iohara - miki algebra and can be expressed by generalized macdonald functions @xcite . by using it , it is shown that @xmath1-dotsenko - fateev integrals are also decomposed into the form of nekrasov formula @xcite .",
    "the relationship between the ding - iohara - miki algebra and 5d nakrasov formula is made clear in @xcite .",
    "macdonald functions , which contain two parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 , are a generalization of orthogonal functions called jack functions and hall - littlewood functions .",
    "the degenerate limit to jack functions , @xmath3 with @xmath4 , agree with the limit from 5d agt conjectures to 4d one",
    ". then the deformed virasoro algebra reduces to the ordinary virasoro algebra , and generalized macdonald functions are specialized to morozov - smirnov s generalized jack functions @xcite . in this limit",
    ", there is a scenario of the proof of 4d agt conjectures as hubbard - stratanovich duality with help of these functions @xcite , and a combinatorial formula of generalized jack functions for the expansion in the basis of schur functions is discovered in @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate behavior at the limit to hall - littlewood functions , @xmath0 , of the deformed virasoro algebra and algebras @xmath5 generated by certain operators @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , which is obtained by the level @xmath8 representation of the ding - iohara - miki algebra . also 5d agt conjectures are studied at this limit . in this case",
    ", phenomena turn simple and some problems can be solved . in particular , by virtue of theories of hall - littlewood functions , we can solve the conjecture that the pbw type vectors of the algebra @xmath5 form a basis over its representation space when @xmath9 . by this fact",
    ", it is also proven that in the generic @xmath1 case the pbw type vector forms a basis .",
    "furthermore , we can obtain and prove an explicit formula ( theorem [ thm : main theorem ] ) for the 4-point correlation function of a certain operator @xmath10 : @xmath11 here for a partition @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 is defined in appendix [ sec : macdonald and hl ] .",
    "the function @xmath15 can be calculated by generalized hall - littlewood functions in the same way as @xcite . however , this formula is obtained by inserting the identity with respect to pbw type vectors .",
    "we call works at this limit `` crystallization '' after one of the quantum groups @xcite since the parameter @xmath1 also represents the temperature in the rsos model @xcite which has symmetry of the deformed virasoro algebra , and the limit @xmath16 can be associated with the zero temperature . although our studies are mathematically different from the notion of the original crystal base of quantum groups , the physical meaning and the motivation to simplify phenomena are same . to investigate their mathematical relationship is interesting further studies . on the other hand , the 5d nekrasov formula express the instanton partition function of theories on @xmath17 .",
    "the limit @xmath0 correspond to the limit @xmath18 , where @xmath19 means the radius of @xmath20 .",
    "thus under the naive concept that the circle of radius infinity converge to a strait line @xmath21 , the nekrasov function at this limit @xmath22 ( [ eq : tildez ] ) may express a partition function of some theory on @xmath23 .",
    "incidentally , macdonald functions are reduced to uglov functions @xcite at the root of unity limit of parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "agt conjectures at this limit have been also studied .",
    "for example , the super virasoro algebra are generated from the deformed virasoro algebra at the limit @xmath24 , and it correspond to theories on the ale space @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "moreover , certain conformal algebras @xmath26 are introduced in @xcite and applied to agt correspondence .",
