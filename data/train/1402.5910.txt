    "experiments using trapped ions often provide a superior system for making precision measurements in applications such as determining atomic structure parameters[[sherman ] ] , microwave or optimal atomic clocks[[warrington],[itano ] ] , searches for time variations of fundamental constants[[itano],[peik ] ] , or making precision measurements of atomic parity violation[[fortson - ionpnc],[schacht],[koerber ] ] .",
    "the precision possible in such experiments is fundamentally due to the intrinsic properties of a trapped ion system through its relatively clean and isolated environment , but is finally determined as it is for all experiments by systematics and sensitivity .",
    "systematic issues are commonly analyzed extensively , but sensitivity has not yet been considered in the detail common to many more traditional precision atomic measurements such as atomic parity violation[[vetter],[wood ] ] . a careful consideration of the choice of certain experimental parameters can yield important improvements in sensitivity for many kinds of experiments and a corresponding improvement in the precision possible .",
    "trapped ion experiments typically consist of many trials of some pump , interaction , probe sequence .",
    "the pump stage prepares the ion in a particular state . during the interaction stage",
    "the ion is either actively driven by a set of applied fields , or just allowed to evolve in isolation , in both cases for the purposes of studying the dynamics of particular interest .",
    "for example , the ion may be driven by another laser beam or a radio - frequency field to characterize a resonant coupling to another state , or allowed to evolve in the absence of all light in order to measure an excited state lifetime .",
    "the probe stage detects whether a transition out of the initially prepared state occurred during this interaction period . by measuring the probe signal as a function of drive parameters such as drive rate , time or frequency , or wait time",
    ", some quantity of interest relating to the dynamics of the interaction can be determined .",
    "the probe is usually implemented using some variation of the electron shelving method[[dehmelt - shelving ] ] . with high cooling rates , and well isolated shelved states with sufficiently long lifetimes ,",
    "state detection using shelving can be done with almost perfect efficiency for almost any combination of probe parameters .",
    "the results of many trials can be interpreted directly as a transition probability .    under less ideal circumstances the probe signal requires additional information to interpret , and in such cases even limited sensitivity for state detection may require parameters like probe time to be chosen from a particular , narrow range of values .",
    "the sensitivity can be maximized by using specific optimal values of these parameters .",
    "the improvements in sensitivity when using optimal values may be only a few@xmath210% , or a factor of 2 - 10 and more depending on the starting point .",
    "determining these optimal values is straight - forward and for precision experiments that are primarily limited by statistics it is usually well worth the effort .",
    "shelving makes use of a set of cycling transitions , the probe cycle , that includes at least two states , and another state that is not part of this cycle , the shelved state .",
    "these cycling transitions and states are usually related to those that are used to doppler cool the ions .",
    "ideally the shelved state is long - lived and well - isolated from the probe cycle , well isolated meaning that there is negligible rate or probability for transitions between this state and any part of the probe cycle when the beams that drive the cycle are applied .    a generalized level diagram of this kind of system is shown in figure [ level - diagram ] .",
    "this kind of level diagram is qualitatively similar to that of most alkali - like ions .",
    "the @xmath3 are typically part of a @xmath4 cooling scheme .",
    "@xmath5 may be a zeeman sublevel uncoupled by angular momentum selection rules by using a particular polarization , a hyperfine manifold not part of the nominal cooling cycle , or an entirely separate long - lived state .",
    "for example , in singly - charged ytterbium ions , the doppler cooling cycle comprises the 370 nm transition from the @xmath6s@xmath7 ground state to the @xmath6p@xmath7 state with leakage to @xmath6d@xmath8 state ( corresponding to state c3 in figure [ level - diagram ] ) necessitating a repump laser beam at 935 nm .",
    "the shelved state , s , in this instance can be a hyperfine sublevel of the @xmath6d@xmath8 state in the odd isotopes of yb or the long - lived @xmath6f@xmath9 state in any isotope .",
    "an ion in a state that is part of the probe cycle when that cycle is driven will fluoresce at some rate @xmath10 that can be detected by a photo - multiplier tube ( pmt ) .",
    "in addition there will be some background rate @xmath11 due to ambient light or light scattered from the laser beam driving the probe cycle .",
    "this background rate is presumed to be independent of the ion s state , so the pmt signal for an ion in the cycle corresponds to a total rate @xmath12 .    to shelve",
    "the ion is to drive it to the shelved state .",
    "an ion in the shelved state does not fluoresce when the probe cycle is driven , so the pmt signal will correspond to the background rate .",
    "the probe cycle then provides a probe of the ion s state .      to determine if an ion is in its shelved state the probe cycling transitions are driven for some probe time @xmath13 .",
    "the resulting pmt counts collected , @xmath14 , will depend on the initial state of the ion .",
    "if the cycling and background rates are constant during the course of the probe , the average number of photons collected will be @xmath15 for an ion that is not shelved and @xmath16 for a ion that is shelved .",
    "if @xmath14 is large enough , uncertainties from poisson counting statistics will be small , the result of a single probe will give @xmath14 very close to either @xmath17 or @xmath18 , and the initial state of the ion can be determined with negligible uncertainty .",
    "an ion was very likely in the shelved state if the probe results in @xmath19 , for some threshold @xmath20 , and likely not shelved if @xmath21 . with good counting statistics",
    "@xmath20 can easily be chosen as almost any value between @xmath17 and @xmath18 and the particular value used is not important . as counting statistics become poor interpretation of the probe count @xmath14 becomes less straight - forward so that measurement precision will be affected by the choice of the threshold and an optimal value can be determined .    in practice",
    ", the complete probe stage may begin with a set of transitions that drive the ion to the shelved state from a particular state involved in the interaction stage .",
    "the probability that the ion was in the state of interest at the beginning of the probe stage then corresponds directly to the probability that an ion is shelved after this probe preparation step . in practice the procedure that conditionally shelves the ion may not be perfectly efficient . generally the probabilities will be linearly related , but the details depend on the particular measurement and vary considerably . here only determining the resulting shelving probability , @xmath22 , will be considered .    by repeating the probe step many times for an identically prepared ion , @xmath22",
    "is given directly by the fraction of trials , @xmath23 , that resulted in @xmath24 giving @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the total number of trials .",
    "the uncertainty in determining @xmath22 , @xmath27 , is then given simply by binomial statistics , @xmath28 the binomial distribution and its properties relevant to this material are reviewed in the appendix [ [ section - appendix ] ] .    in some systems",
    "a short shelved - state lifetime or losses from the cycling states during the probe mean that the cycling and background rates are not constant and this can limit the time during which the probe is effectively able to distinguish the initial state .",
    "this will be considered in detail below , but for now note that if the cycling rate is too low relative to the background rate , the resulting @xmath14 may be too small to allow the results of a single probe to be used to infer the initial state of the ion .",
    "figure [ figure - threshold - detection ] illustrates this by comparing the probability to collect some number of photons per probe time for both shelved and unshelved ions for various @xmath17 .",
    "it is assumed that the cycling and background rates are constant and that the counts are given by a poisson distribution @xmath29 with @xmath30 for @xmath31 or @xmath32 which correspond to a shelved or unshelved ion , respectively . to easily compare",
    "the various cases the amplitudes are scaled by @xmath33 , as the height of the peaks roughly decrease by this factor , and @xmath34 is plotted as a function of @xmath35 with @xmath36 fixed so that the peaks always appear in the same position .",
    "this strictly corresponds to changing @xmath17 by varying the probe time @xmath13 , but the same qualitative behavior follows from changing @xmath17 by varying @xmath37 instead through the cycling rate @xmath10 for a fixed @xmath13 which would give a constant @xmath18 . with this",
    "the functions explicitly plotted are @xmath38 and @xmath39 as a function of @xmath40 for selected @xmath41 .",
    "these functions should strictly be defined only for integer values of @xmath42 but to more easily compare the behavior for different @xmath41 they are plotted for continuous @xmath40 as are subsequent similar plots .    for large @xmath17 the distributions",
    "are clearly distinguished and a wide range of thresholds could be used as a cutoff to reliably define the difference between shelved and unshelved ions in a single probe trial .",
    "as @xmath17 is reduced the distributions get wider and the range of possible threshold values is reduced . for particularly small @xmath17",
    "the distributions overlap considerably and there is no threshold that can be used to unambiguously determine the ion s state .",
    "coarsely , the width of each distribution is given by @xmath43 so the total region occupied by the non - negligible parts of the distributions is roughly @xmath44 .",
    "when this becomes comparable to the distance between the peaks , @xmath45 , the distributions start to overlap .",
    "a threshold can then be defined only for @xmath46 which requires sufficiently large @xmath17 and relatively small @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath47for @xmath48 probing an unshelved ion may yield a count less than any chosen threshold @xmath20 , in a sense a false negative , with non - negligible probability @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 the complete and incomplete gamma functions , respectively [ [ arfkin ] ] .",
    "there is a corresponding false positive probability to measure @xmath21 for a shelved ion @xmath52 as well as the correctly interpreted complements @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the probability of detecting an ion to be shelved , @xmath55 will be given by the probability that the ion is actually shelved , @xmath22 , times the probability it is detected as shelved , @xmath56 , plus the probability that it is not shelved , @xmath57 , times the probability it is nevertheless detected as shelved , @xmath58 @xmath59 the corresponding @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath61 is no longer given exactly by @xmath22 except in the limit of @xmath62 .",
    "for all other values @xmath61 is linearly related to @xmath22 .",
    "if @xmath22 must be determined directly from @xmath63 , then the @xmath64 must be known as well and may need to be determined experimentally .",
    "binomial statistics now give the uncertainty in determining @xmath65 from @xmath26 trials @xmath66 simple error propagation using @xmath67 and @xmath68 gives an estimate for the uncertainty in determining @xmath22 , @xmath69 consider the ratio , @xmath70 , of @xmath27 for the binomial distribution to @xmath27 for this non - ideal case @xmath71 so that @xmath72 for @xmath73 , giving @xmath74 and @xmath75 , the limit of perfect detection of the ion s state , @xmath76 .",
    "as @xmath58 and @xmath77 are increased , @xmath56 is always larger than @xmath58 since a shelved ion is always more likely to be detected as shelved than an unshelved ion , and @xmath78 $ ] so @xmath70 is always non - negative",
    ". it also turns out that @xmath70 monotonically decreases with @xmath58 and @xmath77 so that @xmath70 can effectively be regarded as a detection efficiency .",
    "when the ion s shelved state can be determined perfectly @xmath79 .",
    "as detection becomes less reliable @xmath70 decreases until @xmath80 , at which point a probe gives no information about an ion s shelved state , @xmath81 and @xmath27 diverges .",
    "@xmath70 depends on the threshold chosen , @xmath82 , and some choices of @xmath82 yield better sensitivity of @xmath61 to @xmath22 than others .",
    "@xmath70 is also generally a function of @xmath22 , but to get a picture of its behavior take @xmath83 @xmath84 to first order in @xmath58 and @xmath77 this gives , @xmath85 , which is what might have been chosen intuitively as a qualitative measure of detection efficiency .",
    "figure [ figure - threshold - detection - efficiency ] shows @xmath86 and its first order approximation as a function of @xmath87 for the parameters corresponding to figure [ figure - threshold - detection ] . for large @xmath17 many values for @xmath40",
    "give @xmath88 , almost perfect detection efficiency .",
    "as @xmath17 decreases this range is reduced , consistent with the qualitative observation that the distributions begin to overlap . at some point",
    "no threshold allows perfectly reliable detection , though @xmath70 indicates that statistically using a threshold detection scheme still gives good sensitivity for determining the shelved state probability if the threshold is chosen to be the optimal value that maximizes @xmath70 , even though the distributions might suggest more significant ambiguity .",
    "this optimal threshold value depends on details of the system including cycling and background rates , and probe time , through @xmath41 and @xmath89 , and the expected shelved state probability , @xmath22 , so finding a general result is not trivial , nor is it particularly illuminating .",
    "however , it is easily determined numerically for any particular set of parameters .",
    "figure [ optimal - threshold ] shows the optimal threshold , determined as the value of @xmath82 that maximizes the detection efficiency , @xmath70 , and the resulting maximal @xmath70 as a function of @xmath22 for the same @xmath90 and @xmath91 as used before .",
    "a single threshold is not optimal for all @xmath22 , but where a range of @xmath22 is anticipated a fixed @xmath20 can be used that approximately optimizes detection over that range .",
    "the dashed curves in figure [ optimal - threshold ] show the detection efficiency that results from using a fixed @xmath92 . for this fixed threshold detection efficiency",
    "remains close to its maximum value over a range at least as large as @xmath93 $ ] .",
    "this analysis might be generalized to a system using more than 1 ion where an array of thresholds could be used to determine for a particular trial how many of the ions were shelved .",
    "the probe count distribution will now be a series of equally spaced peaks , as in figure [ figure - count - distribution - nions ] , corresponding to discrete multiples of the cycling rate that get broader with larger total counts .",
    "as all the peaks get broader with decreasing @xmath94 the peaks corresponding to fewer shelved ions , with resulting relatively high probe counts , will begin to overlap first , while the peaks corresponding to many shelved ions , and few probe counts , may still be well separated . in this case",
    "there would be an array of thresholds and results @xmath95 for the number of times @xmath96 ions are detected as shelved .",
    "some kind of detection efficiency could be calculated again in terms of @xmath97 for @xmath22 as determined from the @xmath95 and with this measure it would then be possible to calculate an optimal set of thresholds @xmath98 .",
    "but such a result is less straight - forward and less general , and this kind of measurement can also result in systematic shifts in the derived @xmath22 in addition to degraded sensitivity for poorly chosen @xmath98 .",
    "instead such a system , as well as the original single ion case , is more easily analyzed using the multi - modal counting statistics considered presently .",
    "for systems with poor probe counting statistics a threshold detection scheme may not provide sufficient information to confidently determine the state of a single ion in one trial or how many ions were shelved if using more than one ion .",
    "instead consider using all the information in the full distribution of probe counts when determining the shelving probability @xmath22 .",
    "take @xmath99 to be the probability of collecting @xmath14 photons during a single probe of an ion that has probability @xmath22 to be in the shelved state . for background , cycling and total rates @xmath11",
    ", @xmath10 and @xmath100 , respectively , and a particular probe time @xmath13 giving @xmath30 , @xmath99 will be the probability that the ion is shelved , @xmath22 , times the probability of a shelved ion giving @xmath14 counts , plus the probability that the ion is not shelved , @xmath101 , times the probability of an unshelved ion giving @xmath14 counts .",
    "if the counts for each pure state probe are given by a poisson distribution , @xmath99 will be @xmath102 @xmath103 is the usual poisson distribution as before .",

    "figure [ figure - bimodal - distribution ] shows an example of @xmath99 as a function of @xmath14 , again using continuous values of @xmath14 for clarity , for various @xmath22 in the case of relatively poor counting statistics . again",
    "the lack of a clear distinction between shelved and un - shelved ions is apparent .",
    "denote an expectation value that explicitly indicates the distribution @xmath104 so that the expectation values of the composite distributions being considered can be calculated more compactly .",
    "this allows for easily checking the normalization @xmath105 and determining the mean , @xmath106 derivations not shown here for these and following statistical results are also detailed in the appendix [ [ section - appendix ] ] .    as might be expected @xmath107 is linearly related to @xmath22 , allowing @xmath107 to be easily used to measure the dependence of @xmath22 on drive parameters .",
    "though as with the threshold probe , if the actual value of @xmath22 is needed , two other parameters must be known , in this case @xmath17 and @xmath94 .    the variance requires a bit more work . with some algebra",

    "there is an extra contribution as large as @xmath112 which dominates as @xmath94 increases .",
    "this is a consequence of the qualitative shape the distribution .",
    "increased statistics will give increasingly narrow peaks , but the positions of the peaks do nt move and the variance eventually just reflects that geometry .      further insight into this is gained by considering the full distribution for @xmath113 trials .",
    "first consider the probability to measure a total of @xmath14 counts after @xmath114 trials , which will be denoted as @xmath115 .",
    "this can be written as a composition of two single trial distributions .",

    "@xmath128 is the uncertainty in the determination of @xmath129 after @xmath26 trials .",

    "the deviation from poisson statistics becomes significant for large @xmath94 .",
    "this extra contribution has not been considered in previous experiments that use shelving in trapped ions and is usually missed if the variance is not determined from the data but instead assumed to be given by @xmath107 .",
    "this will result in underestimating the errors of derived quantities and will result in fits being improperly weighted .",

    "if the total loss rate from the shelved state due to its natural lifetime and non - ideal couplings can be characterized by a single simple @xmath183 and the parasitic pump rate by @xmath184 , a familiar first order rate equation gives the probability for the ion to be shelved as a function of time to be @xmath185 with @xmath186 the initial probability to be shelved at the beginning of the probe , @xmath187 , and @xmath188 .",

    "this gives the same bimodal distribution as found in section [ section - sigma - bimodal ] with the same rates but with @xmath198 : @xmath199 in this case the interpretation of the distribution is slightly different as previously a single probe would follow a single poisson distribution corresponding to one of two different rates .",
    "the composite bimodal distribution results from many trials where the rate for each trial is chosen to be one or the other of those rates with probability @xmath22 , and the possible results are summed .",
    "now , since an ion can decay during a probe , a single trial will have contributions from distributions corresponding to both rates weighted by @xmath197 so that this composition happens during a single trial .",

    "the difference between initial states is only detected during the beginning of the probe during which a probe of an unshelved ion yields some fixed number of extra counts compared to a shelved ion . with longer probe times this difference becomes negligible compared to the total counts , and may become less than the variations due to counting statistics .",
    "though @xmath107 appears most sensitive to @xmath22 for low @xmath13 , @xmath27 diverges as @xmath221 as counting statistics become poor , so that an optimal probe time that minimizes @xmath27 must be some finite , intermediate value .",

    "generally , taking @xmath13 to be within a factor of 2 of its optimal value gives @xmath27 to within about 10% of its minimum value .",
    "note that for this situation @xmath253 improves quickly and simply as the probe coherence time , @xmath214 , increases so that improving @xmath214 in a particular system , if possible , or using a different system allowing for longer @xmath214 may be worthwhile .      for the general case having arbitrary count rates and probe times , using the full form of @xmath238 in terms of @xmath240 , @xmath27 becomes @xmath254 where @xmath10 and @xmath37 are now the cooling and total probe count rates , corresponding to the previously denoted total counts @xmath148 and @xmath255 from the assembly of all the ions .",
    "the @xmath256 term is the binomial statistics contribution , again the limiting value for the case of a threshold probe with perfect detection efficiency .",
