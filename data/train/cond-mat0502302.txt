    "over 50 years , fermi liquid theory serves as the basis for our understanding of the behavior of electrons in metals   @xcite .",
    "developed by landau to describe the behavior of @xmath0 at low @xmath1  @xcite and based on a minimal number of postulates , it allows to describe the behavior of interacting fermions not only qualitatively , but also quantitatively  ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the key postulate of fermi liquid theory is that the interaction between fermions with energies near the fermi energy is weak in any fermi liquid , and does not qualitatively change the structure of low - energy fermionic states compared to a fermi gas . in the green s function language",
    ", the condition of weak scattering near the fermi surface implies that the fermionic self - energy @xmath2 is linear in @xmath3 and in @xmath4 at smallest frequencies and smallest @xmath5 . in particular , at @xmath6 ,",
    "@xmath7 the imaginary part of @xmath8 , responsible for the scattering from one electronic state into the other , and hence , for a finite lifetime of a given fermionic state , must be smaller than @xmath3 , i.e. , should behave at low frequencies as @xmath9 the conditions specified by ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) imply that at low energies , the dominant effect of electron - electron interaction is the shift of the energy levels , proportional to the deviation of the energy level from the fermi surface . at the same time , the levels themselves remain intact , i.e. , they are not destroyed by the interaction .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) imply that in the limit of small @xmath3 and small @xmath10 , the green s function for interacting fermions has the same form as for non - interacting fermions , modulo the renormalization of the fermi velocity and the overall @xmath11 factor : @xmath12 where @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the effective mass .",
    "since the corrections due to electron - electron interactions do not change the functional form of the fermionic propagator , the thermodynamic characteristics of a fermi system , which describe the system s reaction to small external perturbations such as temperature or magnetic field , must retain the same functional form as for free fermions .",
    "this , in particular , implies that the specific heat is linear in @xmath1 at low temperatures , @xmath15 , and the static spin susceptibility reduces to a constant at @xmath16 .",
    "the linear in @xmath1 specific heat and the constant spin susceptibility are the two fundamental properties of a fermi liquid in any @xmath17 .    in this communication",
    ", we consider the situation when the system at @xmath16 is close to a density - wave instability at @xmath18 .",
    "the most straightforward example is a system near a ferromagnetic quantum critical point ( fqcp ) .",
    "spin fluctuations can be either isotropic or anisotropic , i.e. , of ising type , due to spin - orbit coupling .",
    "our conclusions are applicable for both cases . for definiteness , we consider isotropic case .",
    "we assume that the system is weakly coupled far away from the transition .",
    "this implies that the corrections to a fermi liquid are generally small .",
    "near the transition , however , the bosonic mode that mediates interaction between fermions becomes soft , and self - energy corrections increase  @xcite . in @xmath19 , the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath20 scales as a positive power of the ferromagnetic correlation length @xmath21 : @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the coupling , @xmath24 is the interatomic spacing , and @xmath25 is of order of the fermionic bandwidth . at @xmath26 , @xmath27 is small if , as we assume , the interaction is small compared to @xmath28 . however , as @xmath21 increases , @xmath20 also increases and diverges at a fqcp , where @xmath29 .",
    "the issue brought about in several recent publications  @xcite is whether in this situation a fermi liquid survives right up to a critical point , or it is destroyed already at some distance away from criticality .",
    "the possibility that a fermi liquid is destroyed before a fqcp is based on the observation  @xcite that if the fully renormalized interaction is static , then the effective mass @xmath30 diverges already at @xmath31 , i.e. , at some distance from a fqcp .",
    "it was suggested  @xcite that a new intermediate phase termed as `` fermionic condensate '' may emerge near a fqcp .",
    "we will show that the @xmath32 dependence of the effective mass holds only as long as the retardation of the interaction is a small perturbation , and the self - energy predominantly depends on @xmath33 : @xmath34 .",
    "we show that , as @xmath21 increases , the self - energy crosses over from @xmath35 to @xmath8 already at @xmath36 . above the crossover , the expression for the mass changes from @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",
    "then , as the system enters into the strong coupling regime @xmath39 , the effective mass increases , but it does not diverge until the system reaches a fqcp .",
    "as a result , no new intermediate phase phase appears near fqcp .",
    "a similar situation has recently been found in  @xcite for a transition in a spatially isotropic system into a density - wave state at at finite @xmath40 .",
    "there is a qualitative similarity between the cases @xmath40 considered in  @xcite and @xmath18 considered here in both cases the effective mass does not diverge before fqcp .",
    "however , the physics of the crossover is somewhat different in the two cases ( see below ) .",
    "in our analysis we neglect two other peculiarities of the system behavior near a fqcp .",
    "the first is the non - analytic momentum dependence of the static spin susceptibility  @xcite .",
    "it either makes the ferromagnetic transition first order , or leads to spiral distortion of a second - order ferromagnetic ordering .",
    "the second is the pairing instability  @xcite .",
    "it leads to the development of a dome on top of the fqcp where the system becomes a @xmath41-wave superconductor .",
    "these two peculiarities compete with each other , but both affect the system behavior in the immediate vicinity of the transition , when the locality is already self - generated . in this paper",
    "we will be primarily interested in the origin for the locality , and how the self - energy crosses over from @xmath35 to @xmath8 .",
    "following earlier studies  @xcite we assume that the system behavior near a fqcp is described by the spin - fermion model , in which fermion - fermion interaction is mediated by collective spin fluctuations peaked at @xmath18 : @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "this model describes the physics at low energies and can , in principle , be obtained from the original hubbard - type model of short - range electron - electron interaction on a lattice , after fermions with energies comparable to @xmath28 are integrated out  @xcite . within rpa approximation ,",
    "this procedure is illustrated in fig.[fig_rpa ] .",
    "this separation of scales into a low - energy part and a high - energy part makes sense only when @xmath44 as we will see below that quantum - critical behavior extends to energies of order @xmath45 .",
    "the collective spin fluctuations are low - energy degrees of freedom near fqcp , and they remain in the theory after the high - energy degrees of freedom are eliminated . for fermions ,",
    "the restriction to low - energies implies that their dispersion can be linearized near the fermi surface : @xmath46 .     the schematic derivation of the effective interaction within the rpa approximation .",
    "the dashed line is the effective bosonic propagator . near sdw instability ,",
    "the vertices between solid and dashed lines contain spin @xmath47 matrices . ]    to keep @xmath23 smaller than @xmath28 and , at the same time , bring the system to a ferromagnetic instability requires extra assumptions . within the rpa approximation  @xcite , the full spin susceptibility @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the static spin susceptibility of free fermions .",
    "ferromagnetic instability then occurs only when @xmath50 .",
    "there are two ways out of this .",
    "first , if the range of the interaction @xmath51 is much larger than the interatomic spacing ( i.e. , @xmath52 ) , the condition for fqcp becomes @xmath53 , i.e. , the smallness of @xmath54 is consistent with the closeness to fqcp  @xcite .",
    "second , one can use the fact that the renormalizations outside rpa make effective coupling frequency dependent @xmath55 .",
    "the ferromagnetic instability is then determined by @xmath56 , while the coupling constant @xmath20 involves @xmath57 at small @xmath58 .",
    "the separation of scales then becomes possible if @xmath59 .",
    "we assume that either the range of the interaction , or its frequency dependence validate the condition @xmath60 near a fqcp .",
    "consider first the self - energy within the perturbation theory for eq .",
    "( [ hint ] ) .",
    "the self - energy diagram to first order in @xmath61 is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_1]a . in analytic form , at @xmath16 @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath46 .",
    "the full green s function is related to @xmath64 as @xmath65 . since we are interested in finite @xmath66 and finite deviations from the fermi surface , it is convenient to subtract the constant @xmath67 from the self - energy in ( [ 1.7 ] ) before evaluating the integral .",
    "this constant @xmath67 accounts for the renormalization of the chemical potential and does not affect the physics near fqcp .",
    "we will just neglect it below .",
    "expanding the fermionic dispersion @xmath68 at small @xmath69 as @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the angle between @xmath72 and @xmath73 , we obtain @xmath74 where @xmath75 , and @xmath76[\\omega + \\omega + i v_f ( \\delta k + q \\cos \\theta)]}.   \\label{1.11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we see from ( [ 1.10 ] ) that if @xmath77 is non - singular at small @xmath66 and @xmath78 , the self - energy scales as @xmath66 and @xmath78 .",
    "this implies that the self - energy modifies the parameters in the green s function but does not affect its functional form compared to free fermions , in agreement with the key postulate of the fermi liquid theory .",
    "( a , b )  the self - energy diagram with the bare interaction @xmath61 , and the effective interaction @xmath79 .",
    "( c )  the diagram for the full self - energy .",
    "it contains full fermionic propagator , full vertices , and the fully renormalized @xmath80 . ]",
    "although @xmath81 is non - singular , it has to be evaluated with extra care by two reasons .",
    "first , for a constant @xmath61 , the integrand in ( [ 1.11 ] ) formally diverges at large @xmath82 and @xmath69 , hence the ordering of the integrations over momentum and frequency is relevant .",
    "second , the integrand in ( [ 1.11 ] ) contains two poles separated only by @xmath3 and @xmath83 .",
    "in this situation , one can not just set @xmath84 in evaluating @xmath81 , but rather should consider the limit @xmath85 .",
    "a similar situation occurs near a qcp in which the instability occurs at a finite @xmath69  @xcite .",
    "to evaluate the integral at finite @xmath78 and @xmath66 , we note that @xmath61 can be approximated by a constant only at small @xmath69 , while at large momenta , @xmath61 eventually vanishes for any realistic potential .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath61 at large @xmath69 provides the ultraviolet regularization of the integral in ( [ 1.11 ] ) .",
    "since the regularization is provided by the momentum dependence , one should first integrate over frequency in infinite limits ( the corresponding integral in ( [ 1.11 ] ) is convergent ) , and then integrate over @xmath73 . for practical purposes , it is convenient to introduce @xmath86",
    ". then @xmath87 . performing the integration over @xmath88 , we find that the frequency integral is nonzero when @xmath89 and @xmath90 have different signs , and the two poles in ( [ 1.11 ] ) are located in different half - planes of frequency . for @xmath89 within this interval , the integration over frequency yields @xmath91[\\omega + \\omega + i v_f ( \\delta k + q_1 ) ] } \\nonumber \\\\ & & =   - \\frac{1}{i\\omega_m - v_f \\delta k } \\label{1.13}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for other values of @xmath89 , the poles are in the same half - plane of frequency , and the frequency integral vanishes . since the result of the frequency integration in ( [ 1.13 ] ) does not depend on @xmath89 , the subsequent integration over @xmath89 just gives the length of the interval where the poles are in different half - planes of frequency , i.e. , @xmath78 .",
    "as @xmath78 is vanishingly small , @xmath92 can be safely replaced by @xmath93 .",
    "we then obtain @xmath94 where @xmath95 accordingly , @xmath96 we see that the self - energy depends only on momentum . this result",
    "could indeed be anticipated as the interaction does not depend on frequency .",
    "one could eliminate the frequency dependence in @xmath64 at the very first step of the calculations by shifting the frequency variable in eq .",
    "( [ 1.7 ] ) from @xmath88 to @xmath97 .",
    "we will see , however , that the integration procedure presented above is more appropriate as it allows for straightforward extensions to the case when the interaction does depend on frequency",
    ".    substituting the self - energy from ( [ 1.17 ] ) into the green s function , we obtain @xmath98 , i.e. , the effective mass @xmath99 is @xmath100    by analyzing the computation of @xmath14 , we see that the renormalization of the fermionic mass indeed comes from intermediate fermionic states very near the fermi surface ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "the regions away from the vicinity of the fermi surface do not contribute to the mass renormalization .",
    "this is again in agreement with the fermi liquid theory .",
    "note that from the mathematical point of view , the renormalization of the effective mass is a typical example of an `` anomaly ''  @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xmath102 because of the double pole in ( [ 1.11 ] ) , but the limit @xmath103 of @xmath81 is finite because the double pole is splitted into two single poles , and at finite @xmath78 there exists a range where these two poles are in different half - planes of frequency .",
    "the smallness of the region where this happens is compensated by the smallness of the distance between the two poles . as a result , the momentum and frequency integration in eq .",
    "( [ 1.11 ] ) yields @xmath104 , which is finite at a nonzero @xmath78 and depends on the ratio @xmath105 .",
    "the same term @xmath106 is present in the particle - hole bubble at small momentum and frequency transfer and accounts for the difference between @xmath107 and @xmath108 in the fermi liquid theory  @xcite .",
    "the same type of analysis can be performed for the spin susceptibility , and the result is that the renormalization of @xmath109 due to fermion - fermion interaction also comes from `` anomalous '' terms associated with the splitting of a double pole in the particle - hole bubble at small momentum and frequency transfer . from this perspective",
    ", landau fermi liquid theory can be viewed as the `` theory of anomalies '' .",
    "further , we see from ( [ 1.17 ] ) that the quasiparticle @xmath11 factor is not renormalized by the self - energy and remains @xmath110 .",
    "where the renormalization of @xmath11 comes from ? to answer this question , we return to eq .",
    "( [ 1.11 ] ) .",
    "the renormalization of @xmath11 is related to the renormalization of the frequency dependence of the green s function .",
    "the latter comes from a regular part in @xmath77 , for which @xmath111 . as we said , for a purely static @xmath61 , @xmath102 .",
    "suppose now that the effective interaction acquires some dependence on frequency after high - energy fermions are integrated out .",
    "this frequency dependence must be analytic , as relevant fermionic energies are @xmath112 , i.e. , are much larger than @xmath88 . quite generally then , @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the spin velocity . as the frequency dependence comes from fermions , @xmath115 .    for the interaction as in ( [ 1.21 ] ) , the frequency integral in eq .",
    "( [ 1.11 ] ) for @xmath116 has a double pole at @xmath117 , but also has two extra poles at @xmath118 .",
    "these two extra poles are present in both half - planes of frequency .",
    "hence , even if the frequency integration is extended to the half - plane where there is no double pole , the result of frequency integration remains non - zero , and @xmath116 becomes finite . as the two new poles are not associated with the splitting of a double pole , @xmath116 is generally determined by fermionic states far away from the fermi surface . in particular , at @xmath119 ,",
    "the poles in @xmath120 are located at @xmath121 . by this reason , @xmath11 is the input parameter for the fermi - liquid theory , but it can not be evaluated within the fermi liquid theory , which deals only with fermions near the fermi surface .",
    "we see therefore that , in general , the second - order self - energy @xmath122 has two contributions .",
    "the first , regular contribution , comes from fermionic states far from the fermi surface and yields @xmath123 the second , anomalous contribution , comes from fermionic states near the fermi surface and yields @xmath124 substituting both terms into the expression for @xmath125 , we see that the anomalous self - energy gives rise to the mass renormalization , while the regular part of the self - energy accounts for the renormalization of @xmath11 : @xmath126      the above consideration can be extended to an arbitrary strong interaction .",
    "the full self - energy diagram is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_1]b .",
    "it contains full green s function , the fully renormalized interaction , and the full vertices .",
    "as long as the full green s function at low energies has the fermi liquid form of eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) , the self - energy has an anomalous term which comes from the integration over electronic states very near the fermi surface . for these contribution ,",
    "the fully renormalized vertices can be approximated by their values at @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "the integration over @xmath88 and over @xmath89 then proceeds the same way as before and yields @xmath129 where now @xmath130 here @xmath131 is the fully renormalized interaction , and @xmath132 accounts for the vertex renormalization .",
    "observe that @xmath133 in ( [ 1.25 ] ) is a bare fermi velocity .",
    "the regular contribution can be rather complex because both @xmath134 and @xmath135 depend on frequency .",
    "still , however , the regular self - energy depends only on @xmath116 and is given by @xmath136 substituting the full self - energy into the equation for the full green s function , we obtain @xmath137 eq .",
    "( [ 1.27 ] ) determines @xmath11 , while eq .",
    "( [ 1.28 ] ) determines the mass renormalization in terms of @xmath11 and the coupling constant @xmath20 .      as we discussed , the low - energy theory based on the spin - fermion model is valid only when the spin - fermion interaction @xmath23 is much smaller than the fermionic bandwidth @xmath138 .",
    "the dimensionless @xmath20 scales with @xmath54 , and is a small number within the spin - fermion model when @xmath119 . alternatively speaking , far away from quantum criticality , the spin - fermion model is only valid in the weak coupling limit .",
    "consider , however , what happens with @xmath20 , given by ( [ 1.24 ] ) when the system approaches fqcp , and @xmath21 diverges .",
    "substituting @xmath139 into ( [ 1.24 ] ) , and assuming that the vertex renormalization is non - singular at small @xmath69 , we obtain @xmath140 for @xmath141 , the integral over @xmath69 is infrared convergent , even when @xmath142 .",
    "the integral is then determined by large @xmath143 and yields @xmath27 , that is , @xmath20 remains small even at fqcp . for @xmath144 ,",
    "the situation is , however , different . for @xmath145 , the integral in ( [ 2.2 ] )",
    "depends logarithmically on the lower limit  @xcite , and @xmath146 we see that , despite the smallness of the @xmath54 ratio , the coupling constant diverges at fqcp .",
    "this implies that in the immediate vicinity of fqcp , the weak coupling approximation becomes invalid .    for @xmath19 ,",
    "the divergence of @xmath20 becomes a power law : @xmath147 .",
    "for @xmath148 we have  @xcite @xmath149      before we proceed with the analysis of the crossover in the self - energy , it is instructive to compare the diagrammatic calculations of @xmath14 with the fermi liquid theory .",

    "@xmath205 substituting it into ( [ dec_29_1 ] ) and using ( [ 1.21 ] ) for @xmath120 , we obtain @xmath206 where @xmath207 , and we used the facts that @xmath115 and @xmath208 . at small frequencies and small momenta , the landau damping term obviously dominates over the regular , @xmath209 term in ( [ 2.8 ] ) .",
    "we therefore will only keep the landau damping term .",
    "we now use eq .",

    "according to eq .",
    "( [ 1.11 ] ) , @xmath210 integrating in ( [ 2.9 ] ) first over frequency and then over momentum and introducing @xmath211 we obtain @xmath212 where @xmath213 , and at large @xmath214 , @xmath215 vanishes as some power of @xmath214 . in @xmath148 , @xmath216 and @xmath217 .",

    "less anticipated is , however , the fact that in the opposite limit of small @xmath214 , @xmath220 , and @xmath221 becomes independent on @xmath222 .",
    "this implies that at small @xmath214 , the regular term in the fermionic self - energy is of the same order as the singular term .",
    "furthermore , one can easily verify that at @xmath223 , @xmath116 comes from fermions in the vicinity of the fermi surface , just as the anomalous part of @xmath224 .",
    "combining regular and anomalous terms in the self - energy , we then obtain @xmath225 the @xmath226dependence of @xmath64 is canceled out between @xmath227 and @xmath228 .",

    "i.e. , at some distance away from fqcp , the anomalous part of the self - energy well exceeds the regular part , and @xmath34 . at small @xmath214 , both regular and anomalous parts of the self - energy are of the same order , and the sum of the two yields @xmath229 .",
    "in this last case , @xmath230 , hence @xmath231 eq . ( [ 1.28_1 ] ) implies that @xmath14 does not diverge before fqcp .",
    "the crucial issue is at what @xmath232 the system experiences the crossover from @xmath35 to @xmath8 .",
    "if the crossover does not occur up to @xmath233 , the effective mass still diverges at @xmath234 , and the eventual transformation to @xmath8 becomes meaningless .",

    ", we obtain that @xmath237 hence the crossover from @xmath35 to @xmath8 occurs at @xmath238 this is the main result of the paper .",
    "we see that the crossover in the self - energy occurs already at small @xmath232 , well before the effective mass apparently diverges .",
    "this implies that eq .",
    "( [ 2.1 ] ) is only applicable at small @xmath20 , and it can not be extrapolated to @xmath31 .      at a first glance , the fact that @xmath239 and @xmath240 are comparable above the crossover to @xmath8 , invalidates the idea that the self - energy in a fermi liquid theory can be viewed as an anomaly .",
    "it turns out , however , that the self - energy @xmath241 can be also identified with the anomaly , however the regularization procedure must be different from the one we used to obtain @xmath242 . to understand this , consider again the full self - energy , eqs .",
    "( [ 1.10 ] ) , ( [ 1.11 ] ) , but now substitute into ( [ 1.11 ] ) the full @xmath196 instead of the bare @xmath120 .",
    "the anomalous part of the self - energy is associated with the splitting of the double pole and is @xmath243 , where @xmath244 is determined by the integral @xmath245 in sec.[se ] , we evaluated this integral by integrating over frequency first .",

    "however , as we already have said , the @xmath249 integral in ( [ 2.14 ] ) is formally ultraviolet divergent , and the result of the integration over momentum and frequency depends on the order of the integration . to check this ,",

    "we obtain @xmath257 using this result , we obtain @xmath258 , which coincides with the self - energy above the crossover .    comparing @xmath259 and @xmath260",
    ", we see that they differ by a constant @xmath261 . which of the two results is the correct one ?",
    "the answer depends on the functional form of @xmath262 which regularizes the integrals ( [ 2.14 ] ) and ( [ 2.16 ] ) . indeed , eqs .",
    "( [ 2.14 ] ) and ( [ 2.16 ] ) are valid as long as @xmath263 can be approximated by a constant and absorbed into @xmath232 . at small @xmath89 and @xmath88 ,",
    "this is true if the system is not at fqcp .",
    "however , at large @xmath89 and @xmath88 , the effective interaction obviously vanishes .",
    "this implies that once we leave @xmath264 in the integrand for @xmath244 , the @xmath265 integral over @xmath89 and @xmath88 will become ultraviolet convergent",

    "the momentum cutoff at @xmath266 is imposed by the lattice .",
    "the frequency cutoff is due to the fact @xmath199 is linear in @xmath88 , hence @xmath267 vanishes at large frequencies . for @xmath268 ,",
    "the frequency dependence of @xmath267 is negligible , and the regularization of the integral for @xmath244 is provided by the momentum cutoff at @xmath269 . in this situation ,",
    "it is natural to integrate over @xmath88 first in infinite limits , and then integrate over @xmath89 up to the cutoff .",
    "after the integral over @xmath88 is evaluated , the subsequent integration over @xmath89 is restricted to a much narrower range than the cutoff , and we obtain @xmath270 independent on the cutoff . as an exercise , we verified that the same result @xmath270 is obtained at @xmath268 by integrating first over @xmath89 , up to the cutoff , and then integrating over frequency .",
    "after the frequency integration , the momentum cutoff disappears from @xmath271 .    for @xmath223 ,",
    "the situation is different as for typical @xmath272 , the landau damping term in @xmath267 exceeds the static part of the effective interaction .",
    "this implies that the regularization is now provided by the dynamical part of @xmath267 . in this situation ,",
    "it is natural to first integrate over @xmath89 , in infinite limits , and then integrate over @xmath88 .",
    "the result is @xmath273 .",
    "again , as an exercise , we verified that @xmath273 at @xmath223 is reproduced if we integrate over @xmath88 first , and then integrate over @xmath89 .",
    "the landau damping term in @xmath267 is relevant at the intermediate stages of the calculations , but disappears from the final answer .",
    "this consideration implies that at @xmath223 , the self - energy @xmath122 can again be divided into the anomalous and regular parts @xmath274 , but now @xmath275 and @xmath276 where @xmath277 is small at @xmath223 . in particular , for @xmath148 , @xmath278 .",
