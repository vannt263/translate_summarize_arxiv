    "matrices the protecting symmetry is a flavour symmetry , which corresponds to independent rotations of left - handed and right - handed fermion fields in flavour space . in the sm the only parameters breaking this symmetry are the small yukawa couplings . in the generic mssm",
    "the flavour symmetries are broken by both the yukawa couplings and the soft supersymmetry - breaking terms and the natural way to restore the protecting symmetry is to set the small parameters in both sectors to zero .",
