    ", one needs to know the behavior of statistical averages in a finite volume , close to the transition point .",
    "this was more or less correctly guessed by several authors @xcite , and put on rigorous footing ( at least for a class of models including the large @xmath0 potts model ) in ref @xcite where the partition function is shown to behave like      this formula is correct for periodic boundary conditions , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are @xmath4 independent functions , and @xmath5 . although there is no analytical continuation of the free energy of one phase into the other phase , both @xmath1 and @xmath2 are shown to be several times differentiable at @xmath6 , the ( infinite volume ) transition point where @xmath7 . as a consequence the finite size behavior of any moment of the energy is obtained by differentiating eq .",

    "in order to estimate @xmath12 and @xmath13 from numerical data , the presence of @xmath22 corrections in eq.[max ] is a nuisance .",
    "as first noticed in @xcite , averages estimated at @xmath6 are better behaved , for example the energy fluctuation          a simple powerful method to determine the value for @xmath6 follows @xcite : perform simulations on increasing sized lattices , at a value close to @xmath6 .",
