    "solar prominences and filaments are large - scale magnetic structures of the solar corona .",
    "the main issues regarding the physics , dynamics , and modeling of these coronal inhabitants have been recently reviewed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "high - resolution observations reveal that prominences and filaments are formed by long ( @xmath1 ) and thin ( @xmath2 ) fine structures , usually called threads .",
    "although the existence of the fine structure of prominences was discovered long time ago ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , its properties and dynamics could only be studied in more detail with recent high - resolution observations .",
    "the fine structures show up as dark ribbons in h@xmath0 images of filaments on the solar disk from the swedish solar telescope ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and as bright features in observations of prominences in the solar limb from the solar optical telescope aboard the hinode satellite ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "statistical studies show that the orientation of threads with respect to the filament long axis can significantly vary within the same filament @xcite , with 20 degrees a mean value typically reported .",
    "vertical threads are more commonly seen in quiescent prominences ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) whereas horizontal threads are usually observed in active region prominences ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite recently pointed out that vertical threads might actually be a pile up of horizontal threads which seem to be vertical structures when projected on the plane of the sky .",
    "however , this is still a matter of controversy .",
    "since threads are observed in both spines and barbs , it is believed that they are the basic building blocks of prominences and filaments @xcite .    theoretically , the fine structures have been modeled as magnetic flux tubes anchored in the solar photosphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are only partially filled with the cool ( @xmath3  k ) filament material , while the rest of the tube is occupied by hot coronal plasma .",
    "therefore , the magnetic field is oriented along the axis of the fine structure .",
    "this model is conceptually in agreement with the idea that the dense prominence material is trapped in dips near the apex of a magnetic arcade connecting two photospheric regions of opposite magnetic polarity .",
    "the dips are supposed to correspond to the observed threads , which are piled up to form the prominence body .",
    "it has also been suggested from differential emission measure studies that each thread might be surrounded by its own prominence - corona transition region ( pctr ) where the plasma physical properties would abruptly vary from prominence to coronal conditions @xcite .",
    "prominence threads are highly dynamic ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , transverse thread oscillations and propagating waves along the threads seem to be ubiquitous in prominences , which have been interpreted in terms of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves ( see the reviews by * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "mass flows along threads , with typical flow velocities of less than 30  km  s@xmath4 , have been also frequently reported ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an interesting property of the observations is the apparent short lifetime of some threads when they are observed in h@xmath0 sequences ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "typically , the threads can be followed for only 5  20 minutes before they seem to fade with time and eventually disappear .",
    "the cause of this quick disappearance is unknown , although several explanations have been proposed .",
    "a possible explanation is related to the presence of flows and mass motions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which may trigger a kelvin - helmholtz instability ( khi ) .",
    "recently , @xcite investigated the khi in magnetic flux tubes due to shear flows generated by transverse motions of the tube , while @xcite studied the khi in twisted tubes due to longitudinal flows .",
    "when the results of both papers are applied to prominences , one obtains that neither the observed transverse velocity amplitudes of oscillating threads nor the longitudinal flow velocities are large enough to trigger a khi on time scales consistent with the apparent lasting time of the threads . on the other hand ,",
    "a different explanation was suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "according to these authors , rapid cooling or heating may cause the maximum of the plasma emission to fall outside the bandpass of the filter , and so the thread would become invisible in h@xmath0 images .",
    "a mechanism that could lead to a rapid heating or cooling of the prominence material is a thermal instability . here",
    ", we explore this possibility by studying the thermal instability of prominence threads    thermal or condensation modes have been extensively investigated in homogeneous plasmas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a relevant work in the context of prominences was performed by @xcite , who studied the thermal mode in homogeneous plasmas with prominence , pctr , and coronal conditions , considering parallel thermal conduction to magnetic field lines and the optically thin radiative loss function of @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained that , for long wavelengths , the thermal mode is unstable for pctr temperatures since thermal conduction is not efficient enough to stabilize the thermal disturbance . in the case of an inhomogeneous plasma ,",
    "thermal modes were studied in detail in the works by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . as the present investigation is based and inspired by these previous works , we summarize their relevant results in the following paragraph .",
    "this will also enable us to clearly define the advancement made in the present paper compared with these previous investigations .",
    "@xcite studied the linear nonadiabatic mhd spectrum of a magnetic cylinder taking into account the effect of plasma inhomogeneity in the transverse direction .",
    "they included radiative losses , heating , and thermal conduction parallel to the magnetic field lines but neglected perpendicular thermal conduction .",
    "these authors pointed out the important result that , along with the classical alfvn and slow continua , there exists an additional thermal continuum , which can be unstable depending on the physical properties of the equilibrium .",
    "subsequently , @xcite investigated the effect on the thermal continuum of thermal conduction perpendicular to the magnetic field lines , and showed that perpendicular thermal conduction replaces the continuum by a dense set of discrete quasi - continuum modes .",
    "these quasi - continuum modes retain the basic stability properties and growth rates of the continuum , and are confined within thin conductive layers around the position of the continuum singularities .",
    "the width of the conductive layer , and so the spatial scale of the quasi - continuum modes , depends on the value of the perpendicular thermal conductivity . @xcite and @xcite applied these results to the context of solar prominences and showed that the spatial scales related to the most unstable quasi - continuum modes of the spectrum are consistent with the size of the prominence threads reported from high - resolution observations .",
    "this suggests that perpendicular thermal conduction may be responsible for the formation of prominence fine structure . in subsequent works",
    ", @xcite investigated the influence of magnetic diffusion on the thermal continuum .",
    "these authors concluded that magnetic diffusion plays a similar role to that of perpendicular thermal conduction as both mechanisms replace the continuum by discrete modes .    in the present work",
    "we follow the method of @xcite and @xcite and investigate the thermal stability of an inhomogeneous prominence thread model .",
    "the equilibrium model adopted here is a cylindrical magnetic tube , representing a prominence thread , embedded in a coronal environment .",
    "the plasma physical properties , i.e. , temperature , density , etc . , are inhomogeneous in the transverse direction , and vary from prominence to pctr and coronal values . in this investigation , we assume that the equilibrium is uniform in the longitudinal direction . the effect of longitudinal plasma inhomogeneity is relegated to a forthcoming study .",
    "we use the nonadiabatic and resistive mhd equations and superimpose linear perturbations on the equilibrium state .",
    "parallel and perpendicular thermal conduction , radiative losses , heating , and magnetic diffusion are the nonideal effects included in our equations . we combine both analytical methods and numerical computations to study the properties of the discrete thermal continuum modes , focusing on the unstable modes with largest growth rates .    this paper is organized as follows . section  [ sec : basic ] contains the basic equations and a description of the equilibrium configuration .",
    "then , sections  [ sec : therm ]  [ sec : param ] contain a theoretical study of the properties of the thermal instability .",
    "the stability of the thermal continuum in the absence of perpendicular thermal conduction and magnetic diffusion is discussed in section  [ sec : therm ] by following the analysis of @xcite , while the unstable thermal modes are investigated in section  [ sec : thermalmodes ] when both perpendicular thermal conduction and magnetic diffusion are included .",

    "as equation  ( [ eq : cont ] ) depends on these derivatives , the thermal continuum has the apparent form of five separated continuous spectra . if the actual cooling function of prominences is known and is used here instead of the present parametrization , the jumps would be replaced by continuous but very abrupt variations of the growth rate at the boundaries between the different regimes .",

    "the result for the three different temperature profiles does not show significant differences . we must mention that the various parametrizations of the radiative regime prominence-1 , which aim to represent different optical thicknesses of the cool prominence plasma , are not relevant for the instability of the continuum .",

    "here , we study how the unstable part of the thermal continuum is modified when perpendicular thermal conduction and magnetic diffusion are taken into account .",
    "unless otherwise stated , hildner s parametrization for the radiative loss function is used in all the following computations .",
    "first , we set @xmath143 and focus our investigation on the effect of perpendicular thermal conduction .",
    "we would like to stress that the real physical value of @xmath29 given by equation  ( [ eq : ionskappa ] ) is used in the following computations .",
    "as stated by @xcite , the thermal continuum is replaced by a set of discrete modes when @xmath144 .",
    "the eigenfunctions of these solutions display large variations in a region surrounding the position of the thermal continuum singularity for @xmath124 .",
    "figure  [ fig : eigen1 ] displays the temperature perturbation , @xmath75 , of the four most unstable modes of our equilibrium in the case of the sinusoidal temperature profile with @xmath145 , @xmath140 and @xmath146 . for simplicity , figure  [ fig : eigen1 ] shows the temperature perturbation only , because @xmath75 is between one and two orders of magnitude larger than the other perturbations .",
    "this means that the temperature perturbation is the dominant disturbance related to the thermal modes , although these solutions produce also velocity and magnetic field perturbations .",
    "figure  [ fig : eigen1 ] focuses on the region where the eigenfunctions show significant variations , i.e. , the conductive layer described by @xcite , whereas their amplitude outside the range plotted in figure  [ fig : eigen1 ] is negligible .",
    "when figure  [ fig : eigen1 ] is repeated for the linear and gaussian temperature profiles , we find that the eigenfunctions are shifted toward smaller @xmath147 for the linear profile , and to larger @xmath147 for the gaussian profile .",
    "however , the form of the perturbations is very similar to those displayed in figure  [ fig : eigen1 ] and , for simplicity , we do not plot the perturbations again .    the order of the solutions can be easily identified by the number of extrema ( maxima and minima ) of their temperature perturbation .",
    "thus , the most unstable mode has one maximum only , the second most unstable mode has one maximum and one minimum , and so on .",
    "the position of the largest extremum is shifted toward larger values of @xmath147 as the order of the mode increases .",
    "in addition , the growth rate ( indicated at the top of the panels of fig .  [ fig : eigen1 ] ) decreases with the order of the mode .",
    "these two results are represented together in figure  [ fig : growth20 ] , which displays the growth rate of the 20 most unstable modes as a function of the position of their largest extremum . in comparison with the thermal continuum , slightly smaller values of the growth rate",
    "are obtained for the quasi - continuum modes .",
    "the displacement of the largest extremum of the discrete modes toward larger values of @xmath147 as their growth rate decreases is consistent with the behavior of the thermal continuum . from figure",
    "[ fig : growth20 ] we also see that the solutions are closer to each other as their order increases .",
    "this result can be explained by taking into account that the perpendicular thermal conductivity ( equation  ( [ eq : ionskappa ] ) ) is @xmath148 . as we move toward larger @xmath147 , @xmath48 increases and @xmath47 decreases in the equilibrium , meaning that @xmath149 gets smaller .",
    "thus , the characteristic perpendicular spatial - scale decreases , causing the modes to cluster as @xmath147 increases .    to shed more light on the behavior of the eigenfunctions with @xmath29",
    ", we perform the substitution @xmath150 in the basic equations , with @xmath151 an enhancing factor .",
    "we can artificially increase the value of @xmath29 by means of @xmath151 and assess its influence on the eigenfunctions .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the most unstable mode .",
    "figure  [ fig : growth202](a ) shows the temperature eigenfunction of the most unstable mode for different values of @xmath151 .",
    "as @xmath151 grows , the temperature eigenfunction becomes broader . to quantify this effect ,",
    "we compute the width @xmath152 of the maximum of the temperature perturbation measured at its half height .",
    "the parameter @xmath152 is related to the thickness of the conductive layer . following the method by @xcite originally used for alfvn and slow resonances",
    ", @xcite obtained that the thickness of the conductive layer is proportional to @xmath153 . in order to compare",
    "the analytical result of @xcite with our numerical computations , figure  [ fig : growth202](b ) shows @xmath154 versus the enhancing parameter @xmath151 .",
    "we see that the dependence of @xmath154 with @xmath151 is consistent with a scaling law of @xmath155 , pointing out that our numerical code works properly and recovers the behavior analytically predicted by @xcite .",
    "we have also computed the eigenfunctions for other values of the azimuthal wavenumber @xmath80 .",
    "we do not have obtained variations of the spectrum of quasi - continuum modes for different values of @xmath80 .",
    "it is worth noting that for @xmath156 , the perturbations @xmath157 and @xmath158 are decoupled from the remaining perturbations , while for @xmath159 all perturbations are coupled .",
    "the temperature perturbation is independent of @xmath80 .",
    "the effect of @xmath80 on the growth rate is studied in section  [ sec : param ] .      here ,",
    "we first consider magnetic diffusion and neglect perpendicular thermal conduction , i.e. , @xmath124 and @xmath160 .",
    "@xcite studied the effect of magnetic diffusion on the thermal continuum . for their particular equilibrium , these authors studied two limit cases of the relative values of the thermal and alfvn time scales .",
    "when the thermal time scale is much longer than the alfvn time scale , @xcite found that the effect of diffusion is to replace the thermal continuum by a dense set of discrete modes , whose growth rate is displaced with respect to the values of the thermal continuum .",
    "the displacement of the growth rate is independent of the value of the diffusivity .",
    "this is the case of the _ cool profile",
    "_ studied by @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the thermal time scale is much shorter than the alfvn time scale , the thermal continuum is not affected by diffusion and the discrete modes are absent .",
    "this other possibility corresponds to the _ hot profile _ of @xcite .    to assess the effect of magnetic diffusion on the thermal continuum of our equilibrium ,",
    "let us compare the alfvn time scale , @xmath161 , with the thermal time scale , @xmath162 , where @xmath82 is here the thermal continuum growth rate and @xmath163 is a typical length scale .",
    "we relate @xmath163 with the longitudinal wavelength of the perturbation , namely @xmath164 .",
    "this is done in figure  [ fig : condition](a ) , which displays the ratio @xmath165 versus @xmath147 with @xmath140 .",
    "we obtain that in the most unstable part of the continuum , i.e. , the beginning of zone 3 , @xmath166 and @xmath167 are of the same order .",
    "therefore , we are in a situation between the limit cases studied by @xcite .",
    "we have numerically checked that the growth rates are not modified by the presence of magnetic diffusion .",
    "in addition , by setting @xmath168 and @xmath124 in the equations implemented in the pde2d code , we have found no discrete thermal solutions .",
    "therefore , the behavior of our equilibrium is similar to that of the _ hot profile _ of @xcite although in our case @xmath166 and @xmath167 are of the same order .",
    "a different issue is to determine how the previously described modes for @xmath144 and @xmath169 ( sec  [ sec : kappa ] ) are affected when magnetic diffusion is included .",
    "hence , we consider the general case @xmath144 and @xmath160 . as was done for the perpendicular thermal conduction , we perform the substitution @xmath170 in the basic equations , with @xmath171 an enhancing factor .",
    "we can artificially increase the value of @xmath24 by means of @xmath171 and assess its influence .",
    "as before , we restrict ourselves to the most unstable mode , whose growth rate versus @xmath171 is displayed in figure  [ fig : condition](b ) .",
    "for @xmath172 the growth rate is constant and coincides with the value for @xmath169 , while the growth rate increases for @xmath173 . for such large values of @xmath171 ,",
    "magnetic diffusion governs the behavior of the solutions .",
    "when the actual value of @xmath24 is considered , i.e. , @xmath174 , the growth rate is approximately the same as that obtained in the absence of magnetic diffusion .",
    "thus , we need much larger , unrealistic values of @xmath24 for the growth rate to be affected by diffusion .",
    "on the other hand , figure  [ fig : eigeneta ] shows the evolution of the temperature perturbation of the most unstable mode as @xmath171 increases .",
    "again , the result for @xmath175 is almost indistinguishable from the eigenfunction for @xmath169 ( compare figs .  [",
    "fig : eigen1](a ) and [ fig : eigeneta](a ) ) . when @xmath171 is increased and so very large , unrealistic values of @xmath24 are considered , the eigenfunction is affected by an additional modulation caused by magnetic diffusion and develops smaller spatial scales as @xmath171 is increased . on the basis of these results , we conclude that , for realistic values of the diffusivity , magnetic diffusion is irrelevant for both the growth rate and the eigenfunctions of the most unstable modes .      we have performed some test computations using klimchuk - raymond s fit for the radiative loss function in order to compare with the results obtained using hildner s fit ( discussed in the previous subsections ) . regarding the form of the temperature perturbations , we find no significant differences .",
    "the maximum of the temperature perturbation is shifted toward slightly larger values of @xmath41 for klimchuk - raymond s fit . for the fundamental mode",
    ", the maximum of @xmath75 takes place at @xmath176 using hildner s fit , and at @xmath177 using klimchuk - raymond s fit for @xmath140 , @xmath145 , and @xmath146 . on the other hand ,",
    "the growth rate is larger for klimchuk - raymond s parametrization .",
    "this is in agreement with the behavior of the thermal continuum ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : continuum](a ) and [ fig : continuumklim ] ) . for the same set of parameters as before ,",
    "the growth rate of the most unstable mode is @xmath178 using hildner s fit , and @xmath179 using klimchuk - raymond s fit .",
    "apart from this difference in the growth rate , the results for both hildner s and klimchuk - raymond s parametrizations are equivalent .",
    "in this section , we study the growth rate of the most unstable mode as a function of the dimensionless longitudinal wavenumber , @xmath142 , the azimuthal wavenumber , @xmath80 , and the thickness of the transitional layer , @xmath180 .",
    "hildner s fit for the radiative loss function is used in all cases .",
    "first , we assess the effect of the azimuthal wavenumber , @xmath80 , ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mazilayer](a ) ) .",
    "note that only positive integer values of @xmath80 are considered in figure  [ fig : mazilayer](a ) as the results are equivalent when negative values are used .",
    "as for the thermal continuum , the value of @xmath80 is irrelevant for the growth rate of the discrete thermal modes . the almost negligible variation of the growth rate with @xmath80 shown in figure  [ fig : mazilayer](a ) might not be physical and might be attributed to the accuracy of the numerical code . on the other hand ,",
    "the dependence on the longitudinal wavenumber is displayed in figure  [ fig : mazilayer](b ) .",
    "the maximum of the growth rate takes place for @xmath181 , while @xmath135 decreases as @xmath142 is increased or reduced . for @xmath182 , the growth rate decreases and the thermal mode",
    "is stabilized by the effect of thermal conduction parallel to magnetic field lines , as commented in section  [ sec : therm ] .",
    "the critical wavenumber for the stabilization is consistent with the expression given in equation  ( [ eq : kzcrit ] ) for the stabilization of the thermal continuum .",
    "the growth rate also decreases with respect to the maximum value when @xmath183 .",
    "this behavior is different from the behavior of the thermal continuum ( compare figs .  [",
    "fig : continuum2 ] and [ fig : mazilayer](b ) ) .",
    "in addition , we find that for @xmath184 a rich collection of couplings between the different thermal modes takes place .",
    "this complex system of couplings is not visible on the scale of figure  [ fig : mazilayer](b ) .",
    "we do not explore these couplings in detail here because they take place for very small @xmath142 and far from the maximum value of the growth rate .",
    "finally , the dependence on the thickness of the transitional layer , @xmath180 , is shown on figure  [ fig : kz ] . in a real prominence thread ,",
    "the thickness of the transitional layer is probably determined by the coefficient of thermal conduction perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "in fully ionized coronal plasmas , the perpendicular thermal conductivity is very small .",
    "however , for cool prominence temperatures the plasma is only partially ionized and the perpendicular thermal conductivity increases by several orders of magnitude due to the effect of thermal conduction by neutrals ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". this effect might be important in the inner part of the pctr .",
    "unfortunately , since the ionization degree in prominence threads is unknown ( see recent estimations * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the thickness of the transitional layer can not be determined with confidence .",
    "for this reason , we take @xmath180 as a free parameter .",
    "the growth rate is almost constant for @xmath185 , whereas @xmath135 decreases for @xmath186 . when @xmath187 , @xmath188 because the transitional layer is absent and the thermal continuum disappears .",
    "as in previous computations , the results for the different temperature profiles are almost identical , hence the form of the temperature profile is not relevant for the growth rate .",
    "this is an important result because it means that our present conclusions apply for all possible temperature profiles in the particular pctr of prominence threads .",
    "in this paper we have shown that prominence threads , modeled as cool and dense magnetic flux tubes embedded in a much hotter and less dense coronal environment , are not stable because unstable thermal modes are present in their particular pctr .",
    "this statement qualitatively agrees with the results from @xcite , who studied thermal instabilities in a two - dimensional spatially random magnetic field distribution , and concluded that cool condensations can not be in static equilibrium with a hot exterior",
    ". however , in the work by @xcite the surrounding of the condensations simply continue to cool down because these authors did not consider the effect of thermal conduction perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "the unstable discrete modes present in our model appear due to the effect of thermal conduction perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "our results for the growth rate of the unstable thermal modes have direct implications for the stability and lifetime of prominence threads . in our analysis",
    ", we have restricted ourselves to the linear stage of the thermal instability .",
    "this stage represents the initial phase in which the unstable thermal mode grows after its excitation .",
    "the combined influence of the different unstable modes will affect the subsequent nonlinear evolution of the plasma within the pctr , because many of the unstable modes have very similar growth rates and the evolution will not be dominated by a single mode .",
    "significant changes in the equilibrium of the threads would take place during the subsequent nonlinear evolution of the thermal instability , because of the large temperature and density gradients generated , which may be detected by the observations .",
    "the growth rate of the linear phase provides us with a reasonable estimation of the typical time scale on which the effect of the thermal instability in the pctr of the threads would be observable and may affect the thread dynamics .    in the analysis of the previous sections",
    ", we have seen that the most relevant parameter affecting the instability growth rate is the longitudinal wavenumber , since it determines the efficiency of parallel thermal conduction as stabilizing mechanism .",
    "if unstable thermal modes are excited in a prominence thread by an arbitrary disturbance , the instability would be dominated by the most unstable solution .",
    "we find that in our model the maximum of the growth takes place for @xmath181 , and corresponds to a dimensionless growth rate of @xmath189 using hildner s radiative loss function , and @xmath190 using klimchuk - raymond s radiative loss function .",
    "the corresponding instability time scale is @xmath191 , with @xmath82 the dimensional growth rate computed from its dimensionless value as @xmath192 . in figure",
    "[ fig : times ] , we plot @xmath166 as a function of the temperature at the center of the thread , @xmath52 , for different values of the thread radius , @xmath54 .",
    "we find that , for realistic values of @xmath52 and @xmath54 , the instability time scale is of the order of a few minutes .",
    "we obtain that @xmath166 decreases as @xmath52 gets higher and increases as @xmath54 gets larger , meaning that cool and wide threads are more thermally stable than hot and thin threads .",
    "we also see that klimchuk - raymond s parametrization produces smaller instability time scales than with hildner s parametrization .",
    "the values of @xmath166 indicated in figure  [ fig : times ] are of the same order of magnitude as the typically observed lasting time of the threads in sequences of h@xmath0 images of solar filaments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "this result implies that the thermal instability may play a relevant role for the dynamics and stability of prominence and filament fine structures , because the time scale related to the thermal instability is consistent with the observed time scale on which threads seem to suffer important changes in their equilibrium .",
    "in this paper we have studied the properties of quasi - continuum thermal modes in a prominence thread model which is transversely inhomogeneous .",
    "we have followed the method of @xcite and @xcite to investigate , first , the stability of the thermal continuum and , later , the effect of cross - field thermal conduction and magnetic diffusion .",
    "we have recovered the general results by @xcite and @xcite in all cases studied in the present paper .",
    "in particular , we have found that the thermal continuum in prominence threads is unstable for pctr temperatures . in agreement with the results of @xcite , the effect of cross - field thermal conduction",
    "is to replace the thermal continuum by discrete modes which retain the unstable character of the continuum . on the contrary ,",
    "the role of magnetic diffusion is negligible in our model ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have obtained the important result that the instability growth rate of the most unstable mode is independent of the form of the temperature profile within the pctr of the thread , and the instability time scale is consistent with the observed lifetime of the threads in h@xmath0 observations of solar filaments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "considering our present results along with those obtained by @xcite and @xcite , we conclude that unstable thermal modes may play a relevant role for both the formation of the prominence fine structure and the subsequent instability of the thin prominence threads .    here",
    "we have considered a fully ionized prominence . however , due to the low temperature in the dense core of the threads , the cool prominence plasma is expected to be partially ionized @xcite . if partial ionization is taken into account , several additional effects have to be considered , namely thermal conduction by neutrals , ambipolar ( or cowling s ) diffusion caused by ion - neutral collisions , and a modified radiation function ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the role of both effects depends strongly on the plasma ionization degree .",
    "it requires complicated computations of nlte radiative transfer and statistical equilibrium of atomic level populations to obtain the precise profile of the ionization degree in prominence threads ( see extensive details in , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , some relevant conclusions can be obtained if one reasonably assumes that the ionization degree in prominence plasmas is mainly determined by the temperature and , to a lesser extend , by the density . while the ionization degree of the core of the thread is unknown , it is realistic to assume that the condition of full ionization occurs in the pctr for temperatures higher than a critical temperature , namely @xmath193 .",
    "the results by @xcite and @xcite suggest realistic values for the critical ionizing temperature for the hydrogen plasma in prominences of @xmath194  k and @xmath195  k , respectively , so only the inner part of the transitional layer would be partially ionized .",
    "according the instability criterion ( equation  ( [ eq : crit1 ] ) ) , the unstable part of the thermal continuum takes place at temperatures higher than @xmath196  k , which is higher than the critical ionizing temperature .",
    "this suggests that the ionization degree of the cool part of the fine structure is probably not relevant for the unstable quasi - continuum modes , because they are mainly confined where hydrogen may be already fully ionized .",
    "however , a detailed investigation of this issue is needed for more robust conclusions .",
    "the present investigation is a first step and should be improved in the future by taking into account relevant effects that have not been included in our model . among these effects , the role of density and magnetic longitudinal inhomogeneity and the effect of magnetic twist will be assessed in forthcoming works .",
    "we have also neglected the effect of mass flows .",
    "previous studies on linear thermal modes in flowing homogeneous prominence plasmas ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests that flows along magnetic field lines do not affect the linear growth rate of the thermal instability .",
