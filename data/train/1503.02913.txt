    "the static casimir force is a physical effect which manifests itself in systems consisting of a fluctuating ( quantum , thermal ,  ) field in the presence of non trivial , time - independent boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the corresponding casimir energy , may be characterized as a real - valued _ functional _ of function(s ) which , under a certain parametrization , define the geometry of the boundaries .",
    "this observation can be used as the starting point for an approximation scheme , the derivative expansion ( de ) originally proposed in ref.@xcite ( for subsequent developments see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the de adopts its simplest form when the boundary conditions considered are ` perfect ' , i.e. , they do not involve any parameter , and the geometry of the system is sufficiently simple , yet non trivial : one has two boundaries , one of them , @xmath1 , is smoothly curved , and describable in terms of a single - valued ` height function ' @xmath2 , which measures the vertical distance of each one of its points to the flat boundary , @xmath3 . in other words , such that @xmath1 can be projected in terms of a single monge patch , with @xmath3 the projection plane .    under the assumptions above , one is clearly left with an energy which is a functional of a single function , @xmath2 , and also possibly a function of the parameters eventually appearing in the definition of the boundary conditions ( specially when they are imperfect ) .",
    "the de is an approximation scheme for that functional , such that its leading - order term is tantamount to the proximity force approximation ( pfa ) @xcite .",
    "the nature of the next - to - leading - order ( ntlo ) term , on the other hand , depends on the type of boundary condition being imposed on the field .",
    "for dirichlet boundary conditions , it has been shown that it is always quadratic in the derivatives of the smooth functions @xmath2 , regardless of the number of spatial dimensions , @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "therefore its contribution to the casimir energy is the integral of a local function .",
    "the same happens for perfect neumann conditions when @xmath5 , but the situation is qualitatively different when @xmath0 : the ntlo term becomes nonlocal in coordinate space , a phenomenon which , we have argued , is a manifestation of the existence of a massless excitation for the fluctuating field @xcite .",
    "a similar effect may be seen to appear for the case of the em field with perfect boundary conditions , also in @xmath0 .",
    "this is , as we shall show below , no coincidence , as both theories , scalar with neumann conditions and em field with perfect boundary conditions are equivalent .    in order to gain more insight about this issue , namely , the special nature of the ntlo contribution for the em field in @xmath6 spacetime dimensions with perfect boundary conditions , we perform here the following analysis : we consider a system with imperfect - conductor boundary conditions on both surfaces , and evaluate the leading and ntlo contributions to the de .",
    "this study is of interest because of several reasons : on the one hand , one knows that the perfect - conductor condition is an approximation to a real , imperfect mirror . besides , it will provide a way to cope with the infrared divergences which would appear for perfect conditions . finally , note",
    "that , in spite of the fact that the system is defined in @xmath6 dimensions , this analysis may be useful even when one considers the @xmath7-dimensional case at finite temperature .",
    "indeed , thermal effects mean that one should take into account the contribution of the matsubara modes  @xcite . among them , the thermal zero mode behaves as a @xmath0 field and , as we have shown , an entirely analogous effect to the one has in @xmath0 is induced  @xcite .",
    "the same can be said of a fluctuating electromagnetic ( em ) field with perfect boundary conditions at a finite temperature , since it can be shown to accommodate a neumann like contribution .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sec : thesys ] we define the system , starting by a description of the duality between the scalar and em field models , and then constructing the model for the em field coupled to the two boundaries .",
    "we then define the respective effective action , functional of the shape of the deformed mirror . in sect .",
    "[ sec : exp ] we present results about the expansion of the effective action to second order in the departure with respect to the case of flat parallel mirrors .",
    "then , in sect .  [ sec : de ] we deal with the de for the casimir energy , based on the results obtained in the previous section . in sect .",
    "[ sec : examp ] we present some examples where the ntlo correction is evaluated for imperfect neumann boundary conditions in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "[ sec : conc ] contains our conclusions .",
    "some technical details about the evaluation of the effective action to the second order in the deformation are presented in an appendix .",
    "let us first see how a real scalar field in @xmath6 dimensions with neumann conditions may be described , alternatively , in terms of an em field with conductor boundary conditions .",
    "we first assume that we want to study a massless quantum real scalar field @xmath8 , satisfying _ perfect _ neumann boundary conditions on two static curves , denoted by @xmath3 and @xmath1 , the former assumed to be straight and the latter slightly curved .",
    "we use euclidean conventions , such that @xmath9 , with , denote the @xmath10-dimensional spacetime coordinates ( @xmath11 imaginary time ) . besides",
    ", we shall use the notation   for a vector on a @xmath12 dimensional spacetime , e.g. .",
    "we have introduced the convention , that we follow in the rest of this paper , that indices from the beginning of the greek alphabet ( @xmath13 ) run over the values @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "no distinction will me made between upper and lower indices , and their vertical position will only be decided having notational clarity in mind .    the free euclidean action for the vacuum field @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 which is complemented by the assumption of neumann boundary conditions on l and r. regarding the casimir energy calculation we just need static boundaries , but it is nevertheless useful to consider a more general , time - dependent expression for the curved boundary r. thus , l and r are defined as the regions in spacetime satisfying the equations : @xmath18 respectively .",
    "the reason to allow for such a time dependence is twofold ; on the one hand the treatment of the problem is more symmetrical , and the physical case may still be recovered at the end by setting @xmath19 . on the other hand , the euclidean effective action which we shall calculate can be used ( reinterpreted ) as the high temperature limit of the free energy for a model in @xmath7 dimensions , with boundaries defined by @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( after a straightforward relabelling of the spacetime coordinates ) .",
    "the form of the boundary conditions imposed on the field at the boundaries ( regarded as spacetime surfaces ) is then @xmath22 where denotes the directional derivative along the direction defined by the unit normal to r , @xmath23 : @xmath24    the scalar field @xmath16 may then be mapped into the @xmath25-potential @xmath26 for an em field , by means of the duality transformation : @xmath27 where @xmath26 is a vector field .",
    "it is an immediate consistency condition of the above , by taking the divergence on both sides , that @xmath16 is massless , @xmath28 , which we shall assume .",
    "now , the boundary conditions ( [ eq : nbcs ] ) corresponds , via the duality transformation , to : @xmath29\\big|_{x_2 = \\psi(x_\\parallel ) } & = & 0 \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the @xmath26 field .",
    "this may be expressed equivalently as the vanishing of the component of the em field tensor which is ` parallel ' to the respective surface ; namely , the component of its dual ( a pseudo - vector ) parallel to the normal at each point vanishes .",
    "let us consider that for r , since the situation for l may be obtained as a particular case , namely , @xmath30 : for r , introducing the projected component of the gauge field , @xmath31 : @xmath32 one gets on the surface the boundary condition : @xmath33 which for @xmath3 simplifies to : @xmath34 i.e. , the @xmath35 component of the electric field vanishes for @xmath36 .",
    "so , regarding the boundary conditions , we have a mapping between neumann and perfect conductor ; for the respective free euclidean lagrangians , we note that , from ( [ eq : duality ] ) : @xmath37 so that the free scalar field action is mapped into the maxwell action : @xmath38 \\;\\leftrightarrow \\;{\\mathcal s}_0[a ] \\,=\\ , \\frac{1}{4 } \\int d^3x f_{\\mu\\nu}^2(a ) \\;.\\ ] ] now we want to deal with _ approximate _ boundary conditions , of such a kind that , for the scalar field would correspond to adding to the action an interaction term @xmath39 localized on two mirrors , and containing the parameter @xmath40 , with the dimensions of a mass , such that perfect conditions are recovered when @xmath41 .",
    "more explicitly , @xmath42 & = & \\frac{1}{2\\mu } \\int d^3x \\left [   \\delta(x_2 ) ( \\partial_2\\varphi(x))^2 \\right.\\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\left .",
    "\\sqrt{g(x_\\parallel ) } \\delta(x_2 - \\psi(x_\\parallel ) ) ( \\partial_n \\varphi(x))^2 \\right ] \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 ^ 2 $ ] is the determinant of the induced metric on r , required to have reparametrization invariance .",
    "we use the same @xmath40 on both mirrors , since we will assume them to have identical properties , differing just in their position and geometry .",
    "the approximate neumann boundary conditions are then introduced in terms of the em field , by adding to the em field action the respective interaction term .",
    "thus , we will work with the action : @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 where @xmath47 with @xmath48 the em field associated to @xmath49 , and @xmath40 the parameter introduced for the scalar field .",
    "the factor @xmath50 is defined by a similar expression , obtained by setting @xmath51 : @xmath52 the interaction terms reproduce eq.([intscalar ] ) when written in terms of the dual scalar field .",
    "following standard procedures @xcite , we rewrite the action in an equivalent form , by using two auxiliary fields , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , living on each one of the surfaces , to linearize the form of the terms localized on the mirrors .",
    "those auxiliary fields are introduced in such a way that , if integrated out , they reproduce the original action , @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "the corresponding equivalent action thus becomes : @xmath56 with @xmath57 and @xmath58\\;,\\ ] ] with @xmath59 .",
    "the action @xmath60 may be seen to be invariant under gauge transformations , @xmath61 as a consequence of the fact that the ` current ' @xmath62 is conserved . since our next step amounts to integrating our the @xmath26 , that action should be first given a gauge fixing .",
    "gauge invariance assures the results are going to be independent of the gauge - fixing adopted , thus our choice is dictated by simplicity . in this case that is the feynman gauge ,",
    "whereby one ads a gauge - fixing action @xmath63 to @xmath64 , to get the free gauge fixed action @xmath65 : @xmath66    now we define the effective action @xmath67 $ ] by the functional integral : @xmath68}\\;=\\ ;   \\frac{\\int { \\mathcal d}a { \\mathcal d}\\xi_{\\rm l}{\\mathcal d}\\xi_{\\rm r } \\;e^{-{\\mathcal s}_{\\rm g}(a)+\\,i\\ , \\int d^3x j_\\mu(x ) a_\\mu(x)}}{\\int { \\mathcal d}a \\;e^{-{\\mathcal s}_{\\rm g}(a ) } } , \\ ] ] where the denominator has been introduced in order to get rid of one infinite factor which is irrelevant to our calculation : the effective action corresponding to the em field in the vacuum , i.e. , in the absence of mirrors .",
    "there are other factors we will get rid of in @xmath69 , associated to the self - energies of the mirrors .",
    "these have the distinctive feature of being independent of the distance between the mirrors , and therefore they do not contribute to the casimir force between them .",
    "we then integrate @xmath70 , obtaining for @xmath67 $ ] a formal expression where we have to integrate over the auxiliary field , which are endowed with an action we denote by @xmath71 : @xmath68}\\;=\\ ;   \\int { \\mathcal d}\\xi_{\\rm l}{\\mathcal d}\\xi_{\\rm r } \\;e^{-{\\mathcal s}_{\\rm",

    "since we will use an expansion in powers of the deformation @xmath76 , we only need them up to the second order in that expansion .",
    "see the appendix for their explicit forms .",
    "we conclude this section by writing the effective action as follows : @xmath77 \\;=\\ ; \\frac{1}{2 } { \\rm tr } \\log [ { \\mathbb k } ] \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is the @xmath79 matrix of components defined by the kernels @xmath80 , while the trace operation acts over the a , b indices , as well as over the spacetime dependencies .",
    "as we have already done in previous applications of the de , we consider the effective action for an , in principle , time - dependent function @xmath2 , taking the static limit at the end of the calculation . in that limit ,",
    "the effective action becomes equal to the vacuum energy @xmath81 , times @xmath82 , the length of the time coordinates .",
    "setting then @xmath83 , we introduce the expansion of @xmath69 in powers of @xmath76 , up to the second order .",
    "thus , @xmath84 where the index denotes the order in @xmath76 . the first order term can be made to vanish by a proper definition of @xmath85 , and we consider the relevant , zeroth and second orders in the following subsections .",

    "mathematically , the integral in momentum space that defines @xmath167 has an infrared divergence . based on analogies with results in the context of quantum field theory in non trivial backgrounds , we argued previously that the physical reason for the emergence of nonlocal corrections is the existence of gapless modes , which happens only for neumann boundary conditions .",

    "<S> we calculate the casimir interaction energy in @xmath0 spatial dimensions between two ( zero - width ) mirrors , one flat , and the other slightly curved , upon which _ imperfect _ conductor boundary conditions are imposed for an electromagnetic ( em ) field . </S>",
    "<S> our main result is a second - order derivative expansion ( de ) approximation for the casimir energy , which is studied in different interesting limits . in particular , we focus on the emergence of a non - analyticity beyond the leading - order term in the de , when approaching the limit of perfectly - conducting mirrors . we also show that the system considered is equivalent to a dual one , consisting of a massless real scalar field satisfying imperfect neumann conditions ( on the very same boundaries ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the results obtained for the em field hold also true for the scalar field model . </S>"
