    "the question of global regularity of solutions is still open for many fundamental equations of fluid dynamics . in the case of the three dimensional navier - stokes and euler equations ,",
    "it remains one of the central open problems of classical mathematical physics and partial differential equations .",
    "much more is known in two dimensions , though the picture is far from complete even in that case .",
    "global regularity of solutions to the 2d incompressible euler equations in smooth domains has been known since the works of wolibner @xcite and hlder @xcite . however , even in 2d the estimates necessary for the euler global regularity barely close , and the best upper bound on the growth of derivatives is double exponential in time .",
    "recently , kiselev and ver ' ak showed that this upper bound is sharp by constructing an example of a solution to the 2d euler equations on a disk whose gradient indeed grows double exponentially in time @xcite .",
    "exponential growth on a domain without a boundary ( the torus @xmath4 ) was recently shown to be possible by zlato @xcite",
    ". some earlier examples of unbounded growth are due to yudovich @xcite , nadirashvili @xcite , and denisov @xcite . in a certain sense that will be made precise below , the 2d euler equations may be regarded as critical , even though we are not aware of a simple scaling argument for such a classification .",
    "as opposed to the 2d euler equations , the global regularity vs finite time singularity question has not been resolved for the two - dimensional surface quasi - geostrophic ( sqg ) equation , which appears in atmospheric science models ( and shares many of its features with the 3d euler equation  see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the sqg equation is given by @xmath5 with @xmath6 and the biot - savart law for the velocity @xmath7 where @xmath8 equation ( [ sqg ] ) has the same form as the 2d euler equations in the vorticity formulation , but the latter has the more regular ( by one derivative ) biot - savart law @xmath9 the sqg equation is usually considered on either @xmath10 or @xmath4 , and the fractional laplacian can be defined via the fourier transform .",
    "the equation appears , for instance , in the book @xcite by pedlosky and was first rigorously studied in the work of constantin , majda and tabak @xcite where , in particular , a closing saddle scenario for a finite time singularity has been suggested .",
    "this scenario and some other related ones have been ruled out in the later works of c ' ordoba @xcite and c ' ordoba and fefferman @xcite .",
    "also , existence of global weak solutions was proved by resnick @xcite .",
    "we should mention that a lot of work has focused on the sqg equation and related active scalars with a fractional dissipation term of the form @xmath11 on the right - hand side of  .",
    "global regularity for the critical viscous sqg equation , with @xmath12 , was proved independently by caffarelli and vasseur @xcite , and by kiselev , nazarov , and volberg @xcite ( see also the subsequent works @xcite for alternative proofs ) .",
    "the global regularity proof is standard for  @xmath13 $ ] ( see e.g. @xcite ) , while in the super - critical case  @xmath14 the question of global regularity vs finite time blow - up remains open .",
    "the best available result in this direction is global regularity for the logarithmically super - critical sqg equation by dabkowski , kiselev , silvestre , and vicol @xcite .",
    "a natural family of active scalars which interpolates between the 2d euler and sqg equations is given by with the biot - savart law @xmath15 this family has been called modified or generalized sqg equations in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite , or the paper @xcite by pierrehumbert , held , and swanson for a geophysical literature reference ) . the cases @xmath1 and @xmath2 correspond to the 2d euler and sqg equations , respectively .",
    "the question of global regularity of the solutions with smooth initial data has been open for all @xmath3 , that is , for any of these models which are more singular than the 2d euler equations .",
    "ironically , even though the sqg and the modified  sqg equations are more singular than the 2d euler equations , no examples of solutions with unbounded growth of derivatives in time are known .",
    "the best result in this direction is arbitrary bounded growth of high sobolev norms on finite time intervals by kiselev and nazarov @xcite .",
    "the reason is that due to nonlinearity and nonlocality of active scalars , it is difficult to control the solutions at large times , and this task gets harder as the biot - savart law becomes more singular .",
    "this issue will be evident in the present paper as well .      while the above discussion concerns active scalars with sufficiently smooth initial data , an important class of solutions to these equations are vortex patches @xmath16 here @xmath17 are some constants , @xmath18 are ( evolving in time ) open sets with non - zero mutual distances and smooth boundaries , and @xmath19 denotes the characteristic function of a domain @xmath20",
    ". vortex patches model flows with abrupt variations in vorticity , which are common in nature .",
    "existence and uniqueness of appropriately defined vortex patch solutions to the 2d euler equations in the whole plane goes back to the work of yudovich @xcite , and regularity in this setting refers to sufficient smoothness of the patch boundaries as well as to the lack of both self - intersections of each patch boundary and touches of different patches .",
    "singularity formation for 2d euler patches had initially been conjectured based on the numerical simulations by buttke @xcite , see majda @xcite for a discussion .",
    "later , simulations by dritschel , mcintyre , and zabusky @xcite questioning the singularity formation prediction appeared ; we refer to @xcite for a review of these and related works .",
    "this controversy was settled in 1993 , when chemin @xcite proved that the boundary of a 2d euler patch remains regular for all times , with a double exponential upper bound on the temporal growth of its curvature ( see also the work by bertozzi and constantin @xcite for a different proof ) .    the patch problem for the sqg equation is more involved . local existence and uniqueness in the class of weak solutions of the special type @xmath21 with @xmath22 and periodic in @xmath23 , corresponding to a ( single patch ) initial condition of the same form , was proved by rodrigo @xcite . for the sqg and modified sqg patches with boundaries which are simple closed @xmath24 curves ,",
    "local existence was established by gancedo  @xcite via a study of a contour equation whose solutions parametrize the patch boundary ( uniqueness of solutions was also proved for the contour equation for  @xmath25 , although not for the original modified sqg equation ) .",
    "local existence of such contour solutions in the more singular case @xmath26 $ ] was obtained by chae , constantin , c ' ordoba , gancedo , and wu @xcite .",
    "existence of splash singularities ( touching of exactly two segments of a patch boundary , which remains uniformly @xmath24 ) for the sqg equation was ruled out by gancedo and strain @xcite .    a computational study of the sqg and modified sqg patches by c ' ordoba , fontelos , mancho , and rodrigo @xcite ( where the patch problem for the modified sqg equation first appeared ) suggested a finite time singularity , with two patches touching each other and simultaneously developing corners at the touching point . a more careful numerical study by mancho @xcite suggests involvement of self - similar elements in this singularity formation process , but its rigorous confirmation and understanding is still lacking .",
    "we note that even local well - posedness is far from trivial for many interface evolution models of fluid dynamics , see e.g. @xcite where the muskat problem is discussed .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for other recent advances in some of the interface problems of fluid dynamics .      in this paper",
    ", we consider the patch evolution for the 2d euler equations and for the modified sqg equations in the presence of boundaries .",
    "the latter are important in many applications , in particular , in the onset of turbulence and in the creation of small scales in the motion of fluids .",
    "the global existence of a single @xmath27 patch for the 2d euler equations on the half - plane @xmath28 was proved by depauw @xcite when the patch does not touch the boundary @xmath29 initially . if it is , then @xcite only proved that the patch will remain @xmath27 for a finite time , while dutrifoy @xcite proved a result which can be used to obtain global existence in the weaker space @xmath30 for some @xmath31 .",
    "uniqueness of solutions in the 2d euler case follows from the work of yudovich @xcite .",
    "since we are not aware of a global existence result without a loss of regularity for ( either one or multiple ) 2d euler patches on the half - plane which may touch its boundary , we will provide a proof of the global existence for such @xmath27 patches here .",
    "this contrasts with our main goal , proving finite time singularity formation for the modified sqg patch evolution with  @xmath3 in domains with a boundary .",
    "these two results together will then also establish existence of a phase transition in the behavior of solutions at @xmath1 .",
    "for the sake of minimizing the technicalities , we do not strive for the greatest generality , and will consider @xmath24 patches ( as in @xcite ) on the half - plane , with small enough @xmath3 ( that is , slightly more singular than the 2d euler case @xmath1 ) .",
    "our initial condition @xmath32 will be the difference of characteristic functions of two patches with smooth boundaries .",
    "the patches will initially touch the boundary of the half - plane and , as was explained above , the loss of @xmath24 regularity or self - intersections of their boundaries , as well as touches of the two patches , will all constitute a singularity .",
    "the possible importance of boundaries in the formation of singularities in fluids has been illustrated by recent numerical simulations of luo and hou @xcite , which suggested a new scenario for singularity formation in the 3d euler equations .",
    "the flow in this scenario is axi - symmetric on a cylinder and so , in a way , can be viewed as two - dimensional ( see @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "the rapid growth of the vorticity in these simulations happens on the boundary of the cylinder .",
    "the geometry of the construction we carry out in this work bears some similarity to this scenario , as well as to the geometry of the kiselev - ver ' ak example of a solution to the 2d euler equations with a double exponential growth of its vorticity gradient .",
    "in particular , in all three instances , a hyperbolic fixed point of the flow located on the boundary is involved .",
    "however the construction itself and the methods we use are quite different from earlier works .",
    "let us now turn to the specifics . as we said above , we will only consider modified sqg evolution for small enough @xmath33 specifically @xmath34 the constraint @xmath35 comes from the currently available local well - posedness results , while the singularity formation argument by itself allows a somewhat larger value .",
    "the bio - savart law for the patch evolution on the half - plane @xmath36  is @xmath37 with the dirichlet laplacian on @xmath20 , which can also be written as @xmath38 for @xmath39 ( up to a positive pre - factor , which can be dropped without loss due to scaling ) .",
    "we use here the notation @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "the vector field @xmath42 given by ( [ eq : velocity_law ] ) is divergence free and tangential to the boundary  @xmath29 , that is , @xmath43 a traditional approach to the 2d euler ( @xmath1 ) vortex patch evolution , going back to yudovich ( see  @xcite for an exposition ) is via the corresponding flow map .",
    "the active scalar @xmath44 is advected by  @xmath42 from ( [ eq : velocity_law ] ) via @xmath45 where @xmath46 the initial condition @xmath32 for - is patch - like , @xmath47 with @xmath48 and @xmath49 bounded open sets , whose closures @xmath50 are pairwise disjoint and whose boundaries  @xmath51 are simple closed curves .",
    "one reason the yudovich theory works for the 2d euler equations is that for @xmath44 which is ( uniformly in time ) in @xmath52 , the velocity field @xmath42 given by ( [ eq : velocity_law ] ) with @xmath1 is log - lipschitz in space , and the flow map @xmath53 is everywhere well - defined . in our situation ,",
    "when @xmath44 is a patch solution and @xmath3 , the flow @xmath42 from ( [ eq : velocity_law ] ) is smooth away from the patch boundaries @xmath54 but is only hlder at @xmath54 which is exactly where one needs to use the flow map ( see lemma  [ lemma : uniform_u_bound ] for the corresponding hlder estimate ) .",
    "thus , the yudovich definition of the evolution may not be applied directly , as the flow trajectories need not be unique when @xmath42 is only hlder continuous .",
    "we will instead use a natural alternative definition of patch solutions to  ( [ sqg])-([eq : velocity_law ] ) , which will be equivalent to the usual definition in the 2d euler case , and closely related to the definitions used in earlier works on modified sqg patches . in order to not interrupt this introduction",
    ", we postpone the precise discussion of these points to section  [ sec : def - flow ]  see definition  [ d.1.1 ] and the rest of that section .",
