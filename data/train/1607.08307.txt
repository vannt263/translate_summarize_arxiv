    "armed with large datasets of high energy collisions , experimentalists have a multitude of choices of how to search for evidence of physics that can not be explained by the standard model ( sm ) theory .",
    "canonical solutions to some of the shortcomings of the sm suggest a conserved @xmath1 symmetry of some type , which has important phenomenological consequences for observing evidence of new particles .",
    "a key implication is that there must be an even number of new particles in each interaction , further implying that they are produced in pairs at colliders . by this same restriction ,",

    "if produced at colliders , lsps will leave the detectors without interacting .",
    "their presence can be inferred through measurement of missing momentum , particularly in the plane transverse to the beam - line at hadron colliders . in practice , extracting information about the properties of the lsp , or the multiplicity of weakly - interacting particles in each event , presents a challenge to reconstruction techniques .",
    "the difficulty is exacerbated in situations where there is a small mass difference between the pair - produced parent sparticles and their lightest sparticle decay products .",
    "such a decay chain scenario is colloquially referred to as being _",
    "compressed_. in this case , the impact of handles typically exploited to separate signal processes from their sm backgrounds , such as large object transverse momentum and missing transverse momentum , is compromised , as the majority of the energy from sparticle decays escapes detection in the mass of the lsps .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a set of experimental observables which can be used to increase sensitivity to these compressed scenarios at collider experiments . as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : motion ] , they are designed for the analysis of events where one or more strong initial state radiation ( isr ) jets are present , causing the system of initially produced sparticles to recoil in the opposite direction . using a simplified view of the event",
    ", a basis of kinematic observables is derived to exploit kinematic correlations induced by the presence of massive lsps , calculated from the missing transverse momentum and particle four - vectors reconstructed by detectors .",
    "while this approach is straight - forward when sm decay products of sparticles in these events are readily identifiable , decays to jets result in a potential ambiguity ; the provenance of each jet , isr or sparticle , is unknown . in sec .",
    "[ sec : jets ] we describe a strategy for overcoming this difficulty , using as an example squark and gluino pair - production with mass splittings between the parent sparticle and lsp of @xmath2 gev .",
    "motivated by r - parity and phenomenologically similar new physics models with a @xmath1 symmetry , we consider cases where initial sparticle parents ( @xmath3 ) are pair - produced , and each decay to a system of reconstructable sm particles and one , or more , weakly - interacting ones . in the following discussion , we assume for simplicity that the masses of these parents are identical , as are the masses their weakly interacting daughters ( @xmath4 ) . an experimental search for instances of these events",
    "can be difficult if the mass - splitting between these sparticle states , @xmath5 , is small , as the momenta of each parent sparticle s decay products ( both visible and invisible ) will not receive a large amount of momentum in their production .",
    "if the mass - splitting scale in sparticle production is to that of sm background processes then disentangling the two is challenging .    in this case",
    ", it is not the mass - splitting scale which is distinctive from backgrounds , but rather , the potentially large absolute mass - scale of weakly - interacting particles in these events .",
    "while we can not measure these masses from only the measurement of missing transverse momentum ( @xmath6 ) , as it only represents the sum momentum of escaping particles , we can gain indirect sensitivity by observing their reaction to a probing force .",
    "the laboratory of a hadron collider naturally provides such a probe : strong initial state radiation from interacting partons can provide large momentum to the sparticles produced in these reactions , in turn endowing their decay products with this momentum . in the limit where the lsps receive no momentum from their parents decays , the @xmath6results solely from the recoil against isr , and",
    "the following approximation holds : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the total isr system transverse momentum .",
    "recent studies of searches for compressed susy signals in the literature have suggested exploiting this feature . in these analyses ,",
    "a kinematic selection is used to isolate events where a single , hard isr jet recoils approximately opposite @xmath6 in the event transverse plane .",
    "one can then use various reconstructed proxies of the quantity @xmath9 , such as @xmath10 or @xmath11 , as observables sensitive to the presence of massive lsps  @xcite . alternatively , using assumed knowledge of the sparticle mass - splittings , one can attempt to sort non - isr jets from radiative ones using , for example , the sum of jet energies in each class and multiplicities as discriminating observables  @xcite . while these approaches all benefit from the above feature , they are limited to the sub - set of events where the momentum of the isr system is carried predominantly by a single jet . for less restrictive event selections , the suggested observables become progressively less accurate estimators of @xmath9 and , correspondingly , less sensitive to the kinematic correlation between radiated jets and missing momentum .",
    "we propose a different approach to an isr - assisted search for compressed signals , both generalizing to cases where momentum can be shared democratically among many radiated jets and attempting to more accurately reconstruct the quantity @xmath9 .",

    "<S> the observation of light super - partners from a supersymmetric extension to the standard model is an intensely sought - after experimental outcome , providing an explanation for the stabilization of the electroweak scale and indicating the existence of new particles which could be consistent with dark matter phenomenology . for compressed scenarios , where sparticle spectra mass - splittings </S>",
    "<S> are small and decay products carry low momenta , dedicated techniques are required in _ all _ searches for supersymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we suggest an approach for these analyses based on the concept of _ recursive jigsaw reconstruction _ , decomposing each event into a basis of complementary observables , for cases where strong initial state radiation has sufficient transverse momentum to elicit the recoil of any final state sparticles . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a collection of kinematic observables which can be used to probe compressed scenarios , in particular exploiting the correlation between missing momentum and that of radiative jets . as an example </S>",
    "<S> , we study squark and gluino production , focusing on mass - splittings between parent super - particles and their lightest decay products between 25 and @xmath0  gev , in hadronic final states where there is an ambiguity in the provenance of reconstructed jets . </S>"
