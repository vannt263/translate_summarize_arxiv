    "unlike previous studies with undoped si , the presence of ionized impurities in the depletion regions of these doped transport layers gives rise to conduction band bending that for sufficient biasing conditions confines injected electrons for long dwell times . by modeling transport with drift and diffusion in the inhomogeneous electric fields provided by the band bending with a monte - carlo method , we simulate both spin precession and spin decay , showing that the transit time distribution of spin - polarized electrons can be controlled over a very wide range with an applied voltage , and can yield a measurement of spin lifetime .",

    "fabrication consists of ultra - high vacuum metal film wafer bonding to assemble a semiconductor - metal - semiconductor hot - electron spin detector ; a silicon - on insulator ( soi ) wafer including a 3.3@xmath0 m single - crystal ( 100 ) nominally 1 - 20 @xmath1 cm phosphorus - doped n - type silicon spin transport layer is bonded to an n - type bulk silicon collector wafer with a ni@xmath2fe@xmath3 ( 4nm)/ cu ( 4 nm ) bilayer .",
    "conventional wet - etching techniques expose the soi device layer , onto which a ferromagnetic - emitter tunnel junction hot - electron spin injector is built .",
    "the final device structure is al ( 40nm)/co@xmath4fe@xmath5 ( 10nm)/al@xmath6o@xmath7/al ( 5nm)/cu ( 5nm)/n - si ( 3.3 @xmath0m)/ni@xmath2fe@xmath3 ( 4nm)/cu ( 4nm)/n - si substrate , as displayed in fig .",
    "1 . further details on fabrication of similar devices can be found in previous reports@xcite .",
    "an applied emitter voltage @xmath8 on the tunnel junction ( larger than the cu / n - si injector schottky barrier ) injects hot electrons tunneling from the ferromagnetic co@xmath4fe@xmath5 cathode through the thin - film al / cu anode base and into the doped silicon transport layer conduction band . the first collector voltage ( @xmath9 )",
    "controls the voltage drop across the transport layer and modifies the spatially nonlinear conduction band potential energy .",
    "electrons escaping the transport layer are ejected over a schottky barrier at the detector side into hot - electron states in a buried ni@xmath2fe@xmath3 thin film .",
    "the final spin polarization is detected by measuring the ballistic component of this hot electron current ( second collector current , @xmath10 ) in the n - type si wafer below ; spin - dependent scattering in the ferromagnetic ni@xmath2fe@xmath3 makes this current dependent on the projection of final spin angle on the ni@xmath2fe@xmath3 detector magnetization .",
    "the spin - detection current @xmath10 was first measured with an external magnetic field parallel to the device plane .",
    "a spin - valve effect , resulting from the different in - plane coercive fields of injector and detector ferromagnetic layers , is displayed in fig .",
    "the measurements were done with @xmath8 = -1.6v applied , using different values of @xmath9 between 4.5v and 8v at temperature @xmath11 = 152k .",
    "because of the @xmath10-@xmath9 dependence , we normalize the data for comparison between different @xmath9 values . after this normalization",
    ", it can be seen that the measurement is only weakly dependent on accelerating voltage @xmath9 over this range .",
    "the in - plane magnetic field was swept between -4 koe to + 4 koe for this measurement .",
    "since the coercive fields of both ferromagnetic ( fm ) layers are smaller than 200 oe , the data obtained from the @xmath9 = 5v measurement is magnified in the inset of fig . 2 and the field sweep direction is specified by correspondingly colored arrows . when the in - plane magnetic field reaches approximately + 20 oe from the negative saturation field ( below -300 oe ) , the ni@xmath2fe@xmath3 layer switches its magnetization , causing an anti - parallel ( ap ) configuration in the two fm layers , which lowers the @xmath10 current relative to a parallel ( p ) configuration , because in this case spin `` up '' is injected , but spin `` down '' is detected .",
    "if the magnetic field increases further , the co@xmath4fe@xmath5 layer reverses magnetization , resulting in a p configuration and restoration of the higher @xmath10 .",
    "this happens as well in the opposite sweeping field direction due to the symmetric but hysteretic coercive fields of each fm layer .",

    "our measurements in a perpendicular magnetic field , using the same experimental conditions as were applied in the spin - valve effect measurement ( v@xmath21 = -1.6v and t = 152k ) , are shown in fig .",

    "the former minima is induced by a full spin flip due to spin precession ( average @xmath22 rad rotation ) during transport through the doped silicon layer , and the latter is induced by the in - plane magnetization switching of the two fm layers by a residual in - plane component of the largely perpendicular magnetic field , causing an antiparallel injector / detector magnetization configuration and reduction in signal as seen in previously - discussed in - plane spin - valve measurements .",
    "this argument is further upheld by changing @xmath9 ; minima attributed to precession appear at higher magnitude of applied perpendicular magnetic field as @xmath9 increases due to the shorter transit time , while the fm switching fields clearly do not change.@xcite     electron spin precession in doped si spin - transport devices .",

    "@xcite is unable to independently determine the ( long ) spin lifetime of conduction electrons in doped si .",
    "we have previously measured spin lifetime of 73ns at similar temperature using a 350 micron - thick undoped si transport layer device ; this lifetime increases to over 500ns at 60k.@xcite        in the undoped silicon transport layers used in previous works,@xcite the schottky depletion region was much larger than the layer thickness .",
    "therefore , the conduction band was linear , resulting in a spatially constant induced electric field , and relatively `` ohmic '' spin transport where the spin transit time was inversely proportional to the injector - detector voltage drop . in this work , however , carrier depletion of the doped silicon due to schottky contacts and the resulting space - charge from ionized impurities causes a nonlinear conduction band that can have a potential energy minimum between depletion regions unless the voltage drop is very large . since injected electrons may sit in this potential well for a long time before escaping over the detector barrier , their spins will depolarize and the observed mc ratio will be suppressed .    to significantly reduce this dwell time ,",
    "an accelerating voltage ( induced by applied voltage @xmath9 , which adds to approximately 0.3v of the applied emitter voltage due to resistive tunnel junction electrodes@xcite ) can be used to alter the confining potential energy . in particular , for sufficient voltage the confining potential can be eliminated .",
    "it is therefore expected that the spin signal is strongly sensitive to applied voltage and `` non - ohmic '' spin transport results .",
    "modeling this non - ohmic behavior is necessary . in previous works using undoped si transport layers where the electric field is constant from injector to detector , a modeling technique using the arrival - time distribution given by the green s function solution to the drift - diffusion equation",
    "can be easily implemented.@xcite however , the electric field in these doped si devices is highly inhomogeneous , making it difficult to implement the standard method here because the drift velocity is spatially dependent , requiring green s function solution of a nonlinear partial differential equation . in general , this procedure is non - trivial .",

    "the simulation shown in ( a ) is insensitive to a choice of @xmath28 over the range 10 - 100ns .",
    ", width=283,height=453 ]    to overcome this problem and simulate spin transport behavior in these doped devices , we use a monte - carlo technique which translates electrons a distance @xmath29 ( due to drift ) , and @xmath30 ( due to diffusion ) in a timestep @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the drift velocity at the position @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the diffusion constant .",

    "using a doping density of @xmath35 @xmath36 , injector schottky barrier height of 0.6ev ( for cu / si ) and detector schottky barrier height of 0.75ev ( for nife / si ) results in a band diagram whose dependence on injector - detector voltage drop is shown in fig .",
    "[ banddiagram ] .",
    "this figure illustrates that the voltage drop across the si transport layer can be used to alter the dominant transport mode : at low bias a wide neutral region exists between depletion regions and electrons must diffuse _ against an electric field _ to escape to the detector , whereas for biases greater than 6v , the potential minimum is annihilated by the boundary so the internal electric field carries electrons toward the detector everywhere and drift is expected to dominate .    a realistic empirical mobility model using eq . 10 from ref .",

    "we simulate transport for @xmath41 electrons at each value of injector - detector voltage drop and the arrival time at the detector for each is recorded .",

    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ banddiagram ] , an electric field opposing transport to the detector is present at low voltage .",
    "electrons must therefore diffuse against this electric field to escape the confining potential in the bulk of the si transport layer . under these conditions of diffusion - dominated transport",
    ", the arrival - time distribution has a very wide exponential shape with average transit time of approximately 500ns , as shown in fig .",
    "[ distributions ] ( a ) .",
    "although the width of the distribution can be reduced significantly by increasing the voltage drop to the point where the si transport layer is fully depleted as shown in fig .",
    "[ distributions ] ( b ) , the confining electric field remains and the exponential shape is maintained .",
    "this indicates that diffusion is still strong .    for sufficiently high voltage drops ,",

    "therefore , as a result of our monte - carlo modeling we see that the average electron transit time in our doped si spin transport devices can be controlled over approximately 4 orders of magnitude by changing the injector - detector voltage drop by only several volts ( from 3v to 6v ) .    using eq .",

    "in particular , the qualitative shape and precession minima positions are well modeled .",
    "the most salient feature of the hanle effect simulation is the magnetic - field width of the central ( zero precession - angle ) peak , plotted as a function of injector - detector voltage drop in fig .",
    "[ hanlewidthpol](a ) and compared to the experimental values .",
    "note that the width is constant for voltages greater than 6v ( due to drift velocity saturation at high electric field in si ) , and the presence of a threshold near 5v ( due to appreciable lowering of the confining potential barrier at the detector side of the transit layer once full - depletion occurs at approximately that voltage ) .",

    "( [ mcpol ] ) with different values of spin lifetime @xmath28 shows that this discrepancy in threshold position is consistent with a long spin lifetime of 10 - 100ns .",
    "this can be compared to a spin lifetime of approximately 73ns measured in undoped si at the same temperature using a different technique.@xcite",
