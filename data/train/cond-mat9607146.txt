    "the normal metallic state of the superconducting cuprates displays many non - fermi - liquid properties . for instance , the in - plane resistivity of la@xmath4sr@xmath5cuo@xmath6 has a power - law temperature dependence of the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 increases from 1 to 1.5 with increasing hole doping @xcite . in particular , near optimal doping , the resistivity is linear in temperature up to 1000k .",
    "this linear-@xmath9 dependence is found in many of the cuprate superconductors with similar values of @xmath10 ( 1.2@xmath11cm / k @xmath12 20% ) @xcite .",
    "this should be contrasted with the quadratic temperature dependence of fermi - liquid theory .",
    "similarly , the transport relaxation rate appears to be universal among optimally - doped compounds : @xmath13 ( from a two - component - model analysis of the optical conductivity in ybco@xcite , lsco@xcite , bi2212@xcite , bi2201@xcite ) .",
    "transport in a magnetic field is also anomalous .",
    "the hall coefficient indicates the existence of hole - like carriers in the doping range where superconductivity occurs .",
    "the hall coefficient @xmath14 increases with decreasing temperature , but it remains smaller than the classical value of @xmath15 for a hole density of @xmath16 for a wide range of temperatures down to the superconducting transition .",
    "these compounds also have a small positive magnetoresistance with a temperature dependence@xcite different from conventional theory using @xmath17 .",
    "the transport properties of these compounds appear to have common features in spite of considerable differences in the transition temperature and spin fluctuation properties among these compounds .",
    "this indicates that a common mechanism is responsible for the scattering of charge carriers in these materials .",
    "one might hope that this scattering mechanism can be understood in terms of a low - energy theory with a minimum number of microscopic parameters . in this paper , we study a bose liquid in a fluctuating gauge field as a possible candidate for such an effective theory .",
    "the anomalous transport behavior , together with other unusual features such as temperature - dependent magnetic susceptibility and non - korringa behavior of the nuclear magnetic relaxation time , leads to the conclusion that the metallic state of the cuprates can not be described in a simple fermi - liquid scenario .",
    "it has been postulated that `` spin - charge separation '' is responsible for these anomalies@xcite .",
    "for instance , such a scenario might reconcile the apparent low density and hole - like character of the charge carriers with the observation of a large , electron - like fermi surface in photoemission .",
    "numerical studies of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model , which is believed to be a low - energy model of the cuprates , also provide some support for spin - charge separation @xcite , such as different energy scales for the spin and charge excitations , and the suppression of 2@xmath18-scattering in the charge spectrum .",
    "a model of spin - charge separation is a gauge theory where neutral spin - half fermions ( `` spinons '' ) and charge-@xmath19 bosons ( `` holons '' ) interact _ via _ an internal u(1 ) gauge field @xcite .",
    "physically , the transverse part of the gauge field is related to `` spin chirality '' fluctuations @xcite . in this picture , the charge properties of the system should be dominated by the behavior of the holons .",
    "we will study the holon subsystem in this paper , treating the spinon subsystem simply as a medium through which the gauge field propagates . to be more precise ,",
    "we study a model of bosons with on - site repulsion in the presence of a spatially fluctuating magnetic field with short - range correlations .",
    "the repulsive interaction is necessary for the stability of the system , which means that one can not treat this problem perturbatively starting from an ideal bose gas .",
    "previous studies @xcite have implicitly studied the non - degenerate regime of low density or high temperature , whereas the regime relevant to the cuprates is the degenerate regime where the thermal debroglie wavelength of the bosons is greater than the mean particle spacing .",
    "a concern from earlier studies of the gauge model is that degenerate bosons would have strong diamagnetic response to the internal gauge field and hence effectively bose - condense at a relatively high temperature ( @xmath20k ) .",
    "this would in fact restore fermi - liquid behavior to the system .",
    "we shall show here that gauge fluctuations suppress this diamagnetic response and the bosons remain normal without strong diamagnetism at all finite temperatures .",
    "furthermore , our numerical results indicate that the resistivity of this bose metallic phase has a linear temperature dependence which is consistent with experiments .",
    "besides the possible relevance to the transport in the cuprate superconductors , the model we consider is of intrinsic theoretical interest .",
    "the model is a bose version of the problem of a quantum particle in a random magnetic flux , which has received considerable attention in recent years .",
    "it is also related to frustrated spin systems and vortex glasses . however , since we deal exclusively with annealed averaging in this paper ( see later ) , we can not draw any direct conclusions about these problems with quenched disorder .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we review the connection between the gauge theory of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model and our boson model . in section iii , we discuss the path - integral formalism which provides a convenient framework to visualize physical processes in terms of the imaginary - time paths of the bosons . in section iv , we look at the effects of the gauge field on the world - line geometry of the bosons .",
    "we will see that the partition function of the system is dominated by self - retracing world - line configurations .",
    "we will also argue that superfluidity is destroyed by the fluctuating gauge field , giving rise to a degenerate bose metal .",
    "in the subsequent sections , we present the results of a quantum monte carlo study of this metallic phase .",
    "we will discuss the transport properties and the density correlations in this boson model .",
    "in this section , we provide the motivation for studying an effective boson model from the gauge theory of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model , which describes the motion of vacancies in a doped mott insulator : @xmath21 with the constraint of no double occupancy . experimentally , @xmath22 1500k and @xmath23 .",
    "the constraint of no double occupancy allows us to write the creation of a physical hole in terms of the creation of a charged hard - core boson ( holon ) and the annihilation of a spin - half fermion ( spinon ) : @xmath24 . in terms of these slave bosons and fermions ,",
    "the hamiltonian of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model can be written as : @xmath25 where @xmath26 , the @xmath27-field is a lagrange multiplier enforcing the local occupancy constraint , and acts as a fluctuating scalar potential for the spinons and holons .    among the mean field theories proposed to decouple the quartic terms in eq .",
    "( [ tj ] ) , a candidate for the normal state near optimal doping is the the uniform resonating - valence - bond ( rvb ) ansatz : @xmath28 .",
    "this incorporates short - range antiferromagnetic correlations without any long - range nel order .",
    "the lagrangian of this rvb phase can be written as : @xmath29    the vector potential @xmath30 arises from the fluctuations in the phase of the rvb order parameter .",
    "longitudinal fluctuations of the gauge field @xmath30 do not affect the lagrangian due to an internal u(1 ) gauge symmetry : @xmath31 we will therefore work in a fixed gauge , such as the coulomb gauge , and consider only the fluctuations in the transverse part of the gauge field @xmath30 . in other words , we will consider only fluctuations in the internal magnetic and electric fields which are gauge - invariant quantities .",
    "since we are interested in the charge degrees of freedom , we wish to consider an effective theory with bosons only , and regard the spinon fluid as a medium through which the gauge field propagates .",
    "the gauge field has no dynamics _ in vacuo_. the response of the spinon fluid to the gauge field is responsible for the dynamics of the gauge field as seen by the holons .",
    "more specifically , we can obtain the gaussian fluctuations of the @xmath32-fields by treating the spinon response in the random - phase approximation .",
    "the effective gauge - field propagator is : @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the linear size of the system , and @xmath37 is the transverse part of the gauge field .",
    "( we use units where distance is measured in terms of the lattice spacing and @xmath38 . ) here , for small @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 , the spinon density of states at the fermi level .",
    "this describes the thomas - fermi screening of internal electric fields by the fermions .",
    "the effective interaction mediated by the screened @xmath42-field is a repulsion between the bosons ( of range @xmath43 ) , consistent with the original hard - core requirement for the bosons .",
    "we will model this with an on - site repulsion energy , @xmath44 .",
    "on the other hand , the magnetic fields due to fluctuations in @xmath30 are not effectively screened out by the fermions@xcite .",
    "the gauge - field fluctuations as experienced by the holons are therefore strong .",
    "more specifically , the gaussian fluctuations have the correlation function @xmath45 , given ( in the continuum limit ) by : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the orbital susceptibility of the spinon fluid and @xmath48 is a landau damping coefficient .",
    "these gauge - field fluctuations cause profuse forward scattering of the bosons .",
    "we believe that this is the dominant scattering mechanism in this problem .",
    "since it is overdamped at long wavelengths with a relaxation rate which diverges as @xmath49 , we will ignore the slow relaxation and work in a `` quasistatic '' limit for the gauge fields : @xmath50 ( on a square lattice , @xmath51 is replaced by @xmath52 . )",
    "this quasistatic approximation is justified when the gauge field relaxes on a time scale longer than @xmath53 .",
    "since the typical scattering wavevector of interest is the inverse debroglie wavelength of the bosons , the relevant relaxation time scales as @xmath54 .",
    "one might therefore expect@xcite that this approximation is valid at a sufficiently low temperature .",
    "one might object that arguments above are based on a weak - coupling theory of the response of the spinons to the gauge fields .",
    "however , we believe that the essential features remain correct in general , namely a separation of times scales between the relaxation of the gauge fields and the boson dynamics , as well as the magnitude of the gauge fluctuations being controlled by the spinon diamagnetic susceptibility @xmath47 .",
    "the gauge - field correlator ( [ quasistat ] ) corresponds to a spatially uncorrelated flux distribution with the correlation function : @xmath55 where @xmath56 ( oriented sum around the links of plaquette @xmath57 ) is the flux through plaquette @xmath57 .",
    "( @xmath58 is the flux quantum . )",
    "since we are treating the thermodynamics for the gauge field classically , we have a thermal factor of @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ fluxtemp ] ) for the flux variance @xmath59 .",
    "given that the fermion orbital susceptibility is roughly constant at low temperatures , we might expect the flux variance to have a linear temperature dependence .",
    "however , a lattice calculation by hlubina _",
    "et al._@xcite has indicated that the gaussian fluctuations are sufficiently strong that the flux through a plaquette is of the order of the flux quantum @xmath60 : @xmath61 down to a temperature of @xmath62 .",
    "since the experimental superconducting @xmath63 is of the order of @xmath64 , we expect that this regime of strong random flux is relevant to the normal state of the cuprates until one approaches the superconducting transition . in this regime , the precise value of @xmath65 should not affect the behavior of the bosons , and we will focus on a _ large and temperature - independent _ flux variance when we study the transport and correlation functions of our boson system .",
    "another factor leading to the reduction of the flux variance at low temperature is one that has not been discussed so far , namely that the magnitude of the gauge field should also be affected by the diamagnetic response of the holons as well as the spinons , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath66 .",
    "the holon contribution dominates near an instability to bose condensation where @xmath67 diverges and the bosons develop a meissner response to expel the gauge field from the system altogether .",
    "however , we will see in this paper that bose condensation and the holon diamagnetism are strongly suppressed even below the boson degeneracy temperature .",
    "therefore , in a wide range of temperatures above the superconducting @xmath63 , we are justified in neglecting this feedback effect of the holons on the magnitude of the gauge field fluctuations .",
    "we can now define more precisely the effective model which we study in the rest of the paper .",
    "it is a model of lattice bosons interacting with a quasistatic gauge field , described by effective action @xmath68 : @xmath69 with the boson hamiltonian @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath36 is the linear size in units of lattice spacing and @xmath72 . note that , on performing the average over the gauge field , we average over static configurations only , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath73 .    we can not say that we have rigorously derived above effective action from the slave - boson mean field theory of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model .",
    "many approximations have been introduced to obtain this simple model with few adjustable parameters .",
    "for example , we have neglected the temperature dependence of the rvb order parameter @xmath74 and also the gauge - field correlations of higher order@xcite .",
    "we take the point of view that we are studying a `` minimal '' low - energy theory which hopefully captures many of the generic features of more complicated models .",
    "it is convenient to study our boson model in a first - quantized formulation .",
    "the partition function @xmath75 for a system with @xmath76 bosons in the canonical ensemble can be written in terms of a feynman path integral@xcite over the boson trajectories @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) : @xmath79\\times\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\int \\!\\ !",

    ", one would have : @xmath84.\\ ] ] particle identity is taken into account by performing the path integral over all trajectories where the set of final boson coordinates at @xmath85 is some permutation of the initial boson coordinates @xmath86 .",
    "any such permutations can be broken down to cycles .",
    "each cycle forms a closed loop when the imaginary - time trajectories ( world lines ) of a many - boson configuration are projected onto real space . at high temperatures , cycles of length 1",
    "dominate the partition function and the system is in a non - degenerate classical regime . at temperatures below the degeneracy temperature of the bosons",
    ", particles can travel large distances in the imaginary time , forming many ring exchanges ( see fig .",
    "[ cycles ] ) .",
    "=    in this formulation , we may integrate out the gaussian fluctuations of the gauge field in ( [ pathpart ] ) .",
    "thus , we arrive at a boson - only effective theory which we study numerically in this work .",
    "the system is described by the partition function @xmath87 where the effective action is given by : @xmath88 with @xmath89 where @xmath90 .",
    "note that the @xmath91 contribution has been excluded in the sum over @xmath92 , corresponding to a gauge choice where the @xmath91 part of @xmath93 is zero .",
    "this is one way to fix the remaining degree of gauge freedom which is not determined by the condition of @xmath94 .",
    "if we consider a system with periodic boundary conditions in space , another scheme would be to fix the line integral of the gauge field around a specified path which wraps around the boundary .",
    "however , the latter scheme is inconvenient for our purposes because it breaks translational invariance explicitly .",
    "the current interaction @xmath95 mediated by the gauge field is logarithmic at large distances , and is attractive between opposite currents . due to the quasistatic nature of the gauge fields ,",
    "the interaction is also infinitely retarded in time .",
    "we will see in the next section that this encourages world lines to retrace themselves , with important consequences for the boson dynamics .    before proceeding to discuss the physical consequences of the current interaction @xmath96 , some remarks about our averaging procedure for the gauge fields are in order .",
    "we have performed an `` annealed '' average over the gauge fields , rather than a `` quenched '' average .",
    "annealed averaging is necessary in our case because our gauge field @xmath93 is an internal thermodynamic variable .",
    "formally , we evaluate observables @xmath97 as : @xmath98\\,{\\cal o}\\ ,   e^{-s_{\\rm b}^0-i\\int{\\bf a}\\cdot d{\\bf x } } } { \\int\\!{\\cal d}{\\bf x}{\\cal d}{\\bf a}\\,p[{\\bf a } ] \\,e^{-s_{\\rm b}^0-i\\int{\\bf a}\\cdot d{\\bf x}}}\\ ] ] where @xmath99 = { \\cal n}^{-1}\\delta(\\nabla\\cdot{\\bf a } ) e^ { - s_{\\rm g}[{\\bf a}]}$ ] is the probability distribution for the gauge field , and @xmath100 is a suitable normalization factor .",
    "this is different from quenched averaging which would be appropriate if we dealt with a system with frozen impurities , such as a vortex glass .",

    "from the point of view of the path integral monte carlo method , our ability to perform the annealed averaging means that we would not have to perform extensive averages over different frozen realizations of the random flux . moreover , note that the effective action ( [ effective ] ) is manifestly real , and so we avoid the sign problem which occurs numerically when performing a quenched average over the gauge fields .",
    "we have studied boson densities between @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "we choose an on - site interaction strength @xmath104 .",
    "we follow the monte carlo methods of ceperley and pollock@xcite and trivedi@xcite .",
    "each monte carlo step involves the reconstruction of the world lines , @xmath77 , for all @xmath76 particles using the ideal boson propagator in a short interval in imaginary time . the on - site interaction and the current interaction @xmath96",
    "are taken into account using metropolis tests . to ensure quantum exchange",
    ", we may insist that each accepted configuration differs from the previous one by a pair exchange .",
    "this can be incorporated , without loss of detailed balance , as a metropolis test .",
    "we refer readers to the original references@xcite for further details .",
    "( in evaluating the gauge field contribution @xmath96 , we have also made use of a geometrical interpretation of @xmath96 which we discuss in the next section . ) in the discretization of the imaginary time , we have used a small @xmath105 , so as to minimize the systematic error and to allow the reliable use of maximum entropy techniques to perform analytic continuation on our imaginary - time data to obtain the dynamical quantities of interest .",
    "this sets the lowest accessible temperature to @xmath106 for lattice sizes considered here . for studies on dynamic response to be discussed later ,",
    "we have restricted ourselves to lattices of sizes up to @xmath107 , due to the need to obtain imaginary time correlation functions to a high accuracy . for the calculation of static properties ,",
    "we have studied lattices as large as @xmath108 .    to summarize , we have obtained an effective theory of bosons with current interactions which are long - ranged in space and time .",
    "this model can be studied using path integral monte carlo methods . in the next section",
    ", we will discuss how these interactions affect the geometry of the boson world lines and hence the physical properties of the system .",
    "in this section , we will discuss how the current interaction @xmath96 mediated by the gauge field affects world - line geometry . on the infinite plane",
    ", there is a simple geometrical interpretation of this interaction in terms of the winding numbers of the boson world lines .",
    "the winding number @xmath109 around a plaquette @xmath57 is the number of times the imaginary - time world lines of all the bosons wind around the plaquette . consider the partition function before averaging over the gauge field .",
    "the effect of the gauge field enters the partition function as the phase factor @xmath110 $ ] in eq .",
    "( [ pathpart ] ) over the gauge field .",
    "this phase factor can be written in terms of @xmath109 : @xmath111 .",
    "we can now perform the average directly over the gaussian flux distribution ( [ modelflux ] ) , instead of the gauge field distribution ( [ modelgauge ] ) .",
    "we will be working with periodic boundary conditions ( _ i.e. _ , on a torus )",
    ". this will be well - defined if we impose a constraint of zero total flux through the system .",
    "on averaging , the phase factor becomes : @xmath112   \\label{wr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus we see that the action cost due to the current interaction is proportional to a geometrical property of the world lines , similar to an unoriented area , which has been termed the `` amperean area''@xcite : @xmath113\\ ] ] this geometrical interpretation of @xmath96 is particularly useful in the numerical evaluation of this quantity .",
    "if we are working with periodic boundary conditions , the geometrical definition of @xmath109 given above will not work because there is an ambiguity in identifying which plaquettes are inside or outside a loop on a torus .",
    "nevertheless , we can still use the above analysis for paths which do not wrap around the boundaries .",
    "( we will discuss wrapping paths in the next section . )",
    "the only modification is that we need a definition of the winding numbers which preserves stokes theorem : @xmath114 . in the case of zero total flux ,",
    "a suitable definition is : @xmath115\\cdot d{\\bf x}$ ] , where @xmath116 is the vector potential at @xmath117 due to a test flux @xmath118 placed at plaquette @xmath57 , and @xmath119 is an arbitrary reference plaquette .",
    "geometrically , this picks @xmath119 to be on the `` outside '' of any loop on the torus .",
    "the amperean area as defined above is independent of the choice of this plaquette , because different choices amount to global changes in the winding numbers ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath120 ) and the above definition is invariant under such changes .",
    "the effect of the gauge field on the particles is now clear .",
    "the action @xmath96 suppresses world - line loops with large winding numbers .",
    "indeed , since @xmath96 is non - negative , it excludes all configurations with finite amperean area in the limit of infinite @xmath65 .",
    "this suppression can be related to the original problem of holes moving in a spin liquid with a slowly varying spin quantization axis .",
    "a hole moving in a loop comes back with a random phase due to the locally fluctuating spin chiralities of the spin background@xcite .",
    "the random phase can be interpreted as arising from a fictitious random flux .",
    "world - line loops that enclose large areas are strongly suppressed when averaged over random flux distribution due to the destructive interference of the random phases .",
    "therefore , we expect that , in the presence of strong random flux , the dominant contribution to the partition function comes from a special kind of paths that do not `` see '' the random flux , _ i.e. _ , paths where @xmath121",
    ". these are `` retracing paths '' where each traversal of a link on the lattice is retraced in the opposite direction at some point in time @xcite , and such paths have zero amperean area .    a similar picture of retracing paths has been studied by brinkman and rice@xcite who studied a single hole in a mott insulator where the spins are treated classically .",
    "indeed , studies of a single particle in a strong random flux have yielded a density of states nearly identical to that of the brinkman - rice problem@xcite .",
    "the brinkman - rice model gives a linear-@xmath9 resistivity at high temperatures ( @xmath122 ) but a constant scattering rate of order @xmath1 .",
    "although we might expect this to be applicable to our model far above the degeneracy temperature of the bosons , this behavior does not extend down to the degenerate regime relevant to the present problem .    at boson densities of interest here and at low temperatures , bose statistics and particle exchange",
    "are important ; they can give rise to behavior different from the single - particle brinkman - rice result .",
    "we shall look at the effect of the gauge field on the quantum exchanges among bosons more carefully in section iv - c . for now , we point out that , even in the presence of strong gauge - field fluctuations , the bosonic nature of the particles can not be ignored because the particles can form long exchange cycles that retraces themselves so that an individual boson does not have to retrace its own path .",
    "this is an important consideration at low temperatures where the imaginary - time paths are long allowing for a strong degree of particle exchange .",
    "although the system can be highly degenerate at low temperatures , we shall now argue that these `` brinkman - rice bosons '' remain normal at all finite temperatures , due to interactions with the fluctuating gauge fields .",
    "we will now discuss the effect of the gauge field fluctuations on the superfluidity of the bose system .",
    "we will see , as in the previous section , that this can be understood in terms of the geometrical properties of the boson world lines .",
    "a neutral bose system with short - range interaction in two dimensions is a superfluid below kosterlitz - thouless temperature @xmath123 .",
    "the onset of superfluidity at @xmath124 is caused by the binding of vortex - antivortex pairs in the bose fluid so that vortex motion does not cause phase slips across the system .",
    "an essential ingredient of the existence of the superfluid phase is a long - range logarithmic attraction between the vortices and the antivortices .",
    "a single vortex costs infinite energy in an infinite system @xmath125 where @xmath32 is a short distance cutoff ( @xmath126 vortex core radius ) and @xmath127 is the superfluid density .",
    "therefore single vortices can not exist at low temperatures .",
    "nevertheless , the proliferation of free vortices is possible above @xmath124 because this provides a gain in entropy which also scales as @xmath128 .",
    "however , in a charged bose system , screening currents causes the vortex interaction to be short - ranged . in our problem ,",
    "the vortex interaction becomes exponentially weak at distances beyond @xmath129^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\phi_0 $ ] , which can be interpreted as a penetration depth of the bose fluid .",
    "now , the creation of a single vortex costs a finite amount of energy@xcite @xmath130 .",
    "this no longer compensates the entropic gain from vortex - antivortex unbinding , and so we do not expect to see a sharp phase transition of the kosterlitz - thouless type at finite temperatures .",
    "one might still expect that there is a crossover temperature scale below which the vortex density will be sufficiently low that the bose system would have strong diamagnetic response .",
    "a rough estimate of this temperature scale using a boltzmann weight for the vortex density gives a large value for this crossover temperature@xcite .",
    "however , we will see later that , in the presence of strong gauge fluctuations , the diamagnetic response of the bosons remains small .    to understand the suppression of superfluidity specifically in our model",
    ", we turn to the path - integral formulation of the problem with periodic boundary conditions ( _ i.e. _ , on a torus ) .",
    "ceperley and pollock@xcite have shown that superfluidity is associated with the existence of long world - line cycles which wrap around the torus .",
    "the superfluid density is given by @xmath131 where @xmath132 @xmath133 is the number of times the boson world lines wrap around the torus in the @xmath134 @xmath135 direction .",
    "in other words , @xmath136 . in the presence of gauge fields , superfluidity is destroyed by the same mechanism that causes the brinkman - rice behavior : wrapping configurations pick up random phases , and should be suppressed by destructive interference on averaging over the gauge field .",
    "the number of plaquettes whose random fluxes contribute to the phase picked up by a wrapping path should increase with increasing system size . for a large enough system",
    ", one might expect this phase to be totally random .",
    "we therefore expect this suppression to be very strong .",
    "for instance , one can evaluate @xmath96 for a straight - line path which wraps around the torus in the @xmath137-direction .",
    "to do so , we use eq.([currint ] ) instead of eq .",
    "( [ wr ] ) because the geometrical interpretation of @xmath96 in terms of winding numbers is not applicable for wrapping paths .",
    "we find that such a path gives @xmath138 to compute @xmath96 for a more general path with wrapping @xmath139 , one can break it down into a wrapping path with the same wrapping number and a non - wrapping path ( fig .",
    "[ figwrap ] ) .",
    "( @xmath96 will consist of the contributions of the wrapping paths and non - wrapping paths separately , as well as a cross - term between the two paths . )",
    "we argue that @xmath96 diverges for all wrapping paths in the thermodynamic limit , and so superfluidity is destroyed at all finite temperatures .",
    "=    it should be noted that we are studying a gauge model where the uniform part of * a * is set to zero .",
    "we may alternatively work with a model without this gauge fixing .",
    "with periodic boundary conditions , this model allows an arbitrary aharonov - bohm ( ab ) flux through the torus .",
    "this flux is related to the phase of the product of rvb parameters ( @xmath140 ) along a ( wilson ) loop which wraps around the torus .",
    "if we average over this ab flux assuming a uniform distribution , we would find that all wrapping paths are strictly prohibited and @xmath141 at _ all _ temperatures even for samples of finite size .",
    "we will not impose such a drastic condition on the wrapping paths in this work .",

    "it should be noted that , although we expect the electron density excitations of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model to be dominated by its holon component , there is no quantitative equivalence between the structure factors of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model and our boson - only model .",
    "nevertheless , we argue that the dynamic structure factor of our model has qualitative similarities with that of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model . for instance , the absence of sharp peaks in the dynamic structure factor is also found in the @xmath1-@xmath2 model .",
    "an obvious similarity , built into our boson model _ a priori _ , is the lack of any structure indicating scattering across a fermi surface at @xmath322 .",

    "we believe that , as in the case of the static structure factor , this discrepancy can be improved with if we use a stronger on - site repulsion . however , the structure factor does not agree with the @xmath1-@xmath2 model along the @xmath326 direction",
    ". it might be that the spectrum of the holes at zero temperature is qualitatively different from the simple tight - binding spectrum that we have assumed here .",
    "in summary , we have studied a degenerate bose system which remains metallic below its degeneracy temperature due to elastic scattering with random and quasistatic gauge fields . in the path - integral picture ,",
    "the bosons retrace their paths in the limit of strong gauge fluctuations in order to avoid the quantum frustration due to the fluctuating gauge field .",
    "we have demonstrated that many features of these `` brinkman - rice bosons '' indeed mimic the behavior of the full @xmath1-@xmath2  model and the normal state of the cuprate superconductors .",

    "this model itself has a strongly suppressed response to external magnetic fields , hinting that the behavior of the system as measured in hall and magnetoresistance experiments have to understood in terms of a separate mechanism .",
    "it would also be interesting to understand the behavior of the system in the zero - temperature limit .",
    "although the limit of infinite gauge fluctuations ( _ i.e. _ , a uniform flux distribution on a lattice ) would strictly forbid any world lines to wrap around periodic boundaries , one may consider the case of weaker gauge fluctuations in the zero - temperature limit and ask whether there is a critical value of @xmath65 below which the system is a superfluid at zero temperature .",
