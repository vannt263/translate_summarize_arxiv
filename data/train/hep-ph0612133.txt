    "supersymmetric extensions of the standard model predict quite generally at least one relatively light higgs boson . hence ,",
    "as soon as results from future collider experiments provide us with informations on the mass of at least one higgs boson , we will be able to put constraints on possible supersymmetric extensions of the standard model .    to this end",
    "we need to know , as accurately as possible , how the higgs boson masses depend on the nature of the supersymmetric extensions of the standard model , and on the parameters of these models .",
    "( we hope , of course , to get independent informations on these parameters from direct sparticle detections in the future . )    in the mssm , corresponding calculations have been pushed to a fairly high accuracy , including many two - loop corrections .",
    "recent reviews on the lightest higgs boson mass in the mssm can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss the simplest version of the nmssm  @xcite with a scale invariant superpotential [ 1.1e ] w = s h_u h_d + s^3 +   , which is the only supersymmetric extension of the standard model where the weak scale originates from the soft susy breaking scale only , i.e. where no supersymmetric dimensionful parameters as @xmath6 are present in the superpotential .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that the lightest higgs boson in the nmssm can be heavier than the one of the mssm due to additional terms in the tree level higgs potential proportional to  @xmath7 ; the additional contribution is [ 1.2e ] m_h^2 = m_z^2 ^2 2  . if one requires the absence of a landau singularity for @xmath1 below the gut scale , @xmath1 is bounded by @xmath8 from above  @xcite , leading still to an upper bound on the mass of the lightest higgs boson that is , however , larger than in the mssm . thus , future measurements of the higgs boson mass could serve to distinguish these two models , provided that we know the difference between the upper bound on the mass of the lightest higgs boson in the different models .    at present",
    ", the radiative corrections in the nmssm have not been computed to quite the same accuracy as in the mssm . of course , radiative corrections in the nmssm that are proportional to the quark / lepton yukawa couplings and the gauge couplings only are the same as in the mssm , but there are many additional contributions involving the new yukawa couplings @xmath1 and @xmath9 in the superpotential in eq .",
    "( [ 1.1e ] ) , and the associated soft trilinear couplings @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the one loop corrections in the nmssm induced by t and b quark / squark loops have been computed already some time ago  @xcite , and the dominant two loop corrections ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) , that are the same as in the mssm , have been included in an analysis of the nmssm higgs sector in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the leading logarithmic one loop corrections to the lightest higgs mass in the nmssm proportional to the electroweak gauge couplings @xmath14 or nmssm specific yukawa couplings @xmath1 , @xmath9 ( @xmath15 ) have been computed only recently  @xcite .",
    "they are included in the latest version of the code  @xcite , where the nmssm higgs masses , couplings and branching ratios are computed as functions of the parameters in the lagrangian of the model .",
    "this code checks also the absence of a landau singularity for @xmath1 below the gut scale using the two loop renormalization group equations , and susy threshold effects around the susy scale .",
    "this procedure is numerically relevant , since @xmath16 depends on @xmath1 , and the upper bound on @xmath1 depends on @xmath0 ( via the top yukawa coupling @xmath17 ) and @xmath9 .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to review the upper bound on the lightest higgs boson mass in the nmssm , using the up - to - date knowledge of the corresponding radiative corrections .    instead of investigating far - fetched regions in parameter space that serve to obtain very conservative bounds",
    ", we proceed as follows : for the soft terms that are relevant for the sparticle spectrum , we chose universal squark and slepton masses of @xmath18  tev , and trilinear couplings of @xmath19  tev ( that practically maximize the one loop radiative corrections to the higgs boson mass ) .",
    "for the gaugino masses we take @xmath20  gev , @xmath21  gev and @xmath22  tev in rough agreement with universal gaugino masses at the gut scale . for the top quark pole mass we present results both for @xmath23  gev ( the latest central value obtained by the tevatron electroweak working group @xcite ) and a very conservative upper limit of @xmath24  gev . the nmssm specific yukawa couplings and trilinear soft terms @xmath1 , @xmath9",
    ", @xmath25 and @xmath26 as well as the effective @xmath6 parameter ( @xmath27 in the nmssm ) are chosen such that the lightest higgs boson mass is maximized , without violating constraints from perturbativity of the yukawa couplings at the gut scale , nor phenomenological constraints on cp odd or charged higgs masses and couplings . to this end a numerical analysis is required , that is performed using the updated version of  @xcite .",
    "the upper bound on the lightest higgs mass is then given as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "for the same choice of the above soft terms , we present the upper bound on the lightest higgs mass in the mssm limit @xmath28 as obtained with . this result can be compared to values obtained from analytical or numerical analyses in the mssm , that include radiative corrections that are still absent in : these are notably electroweak one - loop corrections @xmath29 beyond the lla , and non - dominant two - loop corrections ( involving less than two powers of large logarithms ) @xmath12 and @xmath30 beyond the ones that follow from an rg improvement of the one loop corrections  @xcite ( which are included ) .    for soft terms as above , @xmath24  gev , @xmath31  tev and @xmath32",

    "@xcite ) , feynhiggs @xmath34  gev ( taken from ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and  @xmath35  gev . this allows to estimate the uncertainties on @xmath36 due to the radiative corrections not included in , following the discussions in  @xcite that we will not repeat here .",
    "the striking effect in the nmssm is that the maximal value of @xmath36 is not assumed for large @xmath0 as in the mssm , but at low @xmath37 due to the tree level term noted above .",
    "there we obtain @xmath38  gev for @xmath23  gev , and @xmath39  gev for @xmath24  gev ( for the same other parameters as above ) . for larger values of @xmath0 the upper bound on @xmath36 decreases in the nmssm .",
    "for @xmath40 it hardly exceeds the mssm value given above , since the effect of the tree level term becomes small . for small @xmath41",
    "the absence of a landau singularity below @xmath42 restricts @xmath1 more strongly from above , due to the large top yukawa coupling @xmath17 .",
    "this implies that present lower limits on @xmath36 from lep still lead to a lower bound on @xmath0 of @xmath43 in the nmssm .    it must be noted that in particular regions of the parameter space of the nmssm the upper bound on @xmath36 discussed here can be misleading :    in principle , a singlet - like cp even higgs boson can be lighter than the lightest doublet - like cp even higgs boson ( with non - vanishing couplings to the @xmath44 boson ) in the nmssm . strictly speaking ,",
    "the upper bound on the lightest cp even higgs boson discussed here is then still valid .",
    "however , a singlet - like cp even higgs boson would have been practically undetectable at lep due to its vanishing coupling to the @xmath44 boson .",
    "fortunately , if the lightest cp even higgs boson is a pure singlet in the nmssm , the upper bound on @xmath36 discussed here applies then to the lightest doublet - like cp even higgs boson . on the other hand ,",
    "if the lightest cp even higgs boson is only approximately a singlet , the lightest doublet - like cp even higgs boson can be heavier than the upper bound on @xmath36 discussed here .    a similar reasonning applies to the situation where the doublet - like cp even ( sm like ) higgs boson decays into singlet like ( mostly two cp odd ) scalars  @xcite .",
    "then , the detection of the sm like higgs boson can be very challenging , even if its mass satisfies the upper bounds discussed here .",
    "hence , although the upper bound on @xmath36 presented here is always valid , it may refer to a state that is difficult to detect .",
    "in order to find the regions in the parameter space of the nmssm that maximize the upper bound on the lightest cp even higgs boson mass , it is helpful to take a look at the cp even higgs mass matrix at tree level . in the basis @xmath45 and using the minimization equations in order to eliminate the soft masses squared , it reads : [ 2.1e ] m_s^2 =    where @xmath46 . to a good approximation",
    ", the @xmath47 doublet subsector is diagonalized by the angle @xmath48 which gives the desired light eigenstate @xmath49 and a heavy eigenstate @xmath50 with a mass @xmath51 close to the mssm - like cp odd state ( the larger @xmath52 , the better this approximation ) . in the nmssm",
    ", one can define @xmath53 as the diagonal doublet term in the cp odd @xmath54 mass matrix after the goldstone mode has been dropped . at tree level",
    ", it has the same expression as in the mssm : [ 2.2e ] m_a^2 =  , with b = a_+  .    in the cp even sector of the nmssm",
    "this is not the end of the story , however : the light eigenstate @xmath49 of the @xmath47 doublet subsector still mixes with the singlet state @xmath55 , which is heavier than @xmath49 by assumption . in order to maximize @xmath36",
    ", this mixing has to vanish : [ 2.3e ] ~0  .",
    "on @xmath11 we get the following constraints : @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ 2.1e ] ) must at least be positive , which requires essentially ( since the first term is typically relatively small ) @xmath58 .",
    "the cp odd mass matrix element in the singlet sector , given by [ 2.5e ] m_p,33 ^ 2 = 4 h_u h_d + ^2 a_ -3 a _  ,      next , in order to maximize the nmssm specific tree level contribution to @xmath36 of eq .",
    "( [ 1.2e ] ) , @xmath1 has to be as large as possible ; we require , however , the absence of a landau singularity for all yukawa couplings @xmath59 below the gut scale , which leads to the following constraints :    first , given the corresponding rg equations  @xcite , this implies small values for @xmath9 .",
    "the limit @xmath60 while @xmath1 remains finite is disallowed , however , both from the stability of the potential and the fact that the allowed window of eq .",
    "( [ 2.6e ] ) vanishes in this limit .",
    "( of course , stability of the potential and positivity of all masses squared are related issues . )",
    "second , for small @xmath0 the top quark yukawa coupling becomes large , and can run into a landau singularity below @xmath42 , or induce a landau singularity below @xmath42 for @xmath1 .",
    "the value of @xmath0 that allows for maximal values of @xmath1 ( and maximizes the tree level contribution to @xmath36 of eq  ( [ 1.2e ] ) ) is around 2 .    in this region of @xmath0 , a larger value",
    "for the top quark pole mass does hardly increase the upper bound on @xmath36 : at fixed @xmath0 , larger @xmath2 implies a larger top yukawa coupling @xmath17 , which implies a somewhat lower allowed value for @xmath1 .",
    "consequently a variation of the top quark pole mass between 171.4 and 178  gev ( which increases @xmath36 by @xmath61  gev for @xmath62 ) , increases the maximal allowed value for @xmath36 in the nmssm by only @xmath63  gev for @xmath37 .    for large values of @xmath0 , it is obvious from eq .",
    "( [ 2.2e ] ) that @xmath52 tends to be very large , unless @xmath64 is small .",
    "( @xmath6 can not be smaller than @xmath65  gev due to the lower bound on chargino masses from lep ) .",
    "very large values of @xmath52 are unnatural , since they require supersymmetry breaking higgs masses of the same order of magnitude , which aggravate the fine tuning problem  a situation which we want to avoid . in the mssm , one can always chose @xmath64 small enough to keep @xmath52 reasonable even at large @xmath0 . in the nmssm",
    "this is also possible , provided that @xmath66 .",
    "however , one has also to minimize the doublet - singlet mixing of eq .",
    "( [ 2.3e ] ) in order to to maximize @xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath1 is not very small , eq .  ( [ 2.4e ] ) together with @xmath66 implies @xmath67 , which is equivalent to @xmath68 .",
    "large values of @xmath9 leading to a landau singularity below the gut scale , this is excluded .",
    "thus , the only way of minimizing the doublet - singlet mixing while keeping @xmath52 constant at large @xmath0 is to assume @xmath56 , which means that the bound on @xmath36 is the same as in the mssm .",
    "all these considerations make it clear that a realistic upper limit on @xmath36 in the nmssm requires numerical methods ; analytic approaches can be misleading ( and can allow for larger values of @xmath36 ) .",
    "our results below are obtained with  @xcite .",
    "the precision of the included radiative corrections to the lightest cp even higgs mass has already been discussed in the introduction and is given in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , we take universal squark and slepton masses of 1  tev , and trilinear squark / slepton couplings of 2.5  tev ( near maximal mixing ) . for the gaugino masses",
    "we take @xmath20  gev , @xmath21  gev and @xmath22  tev .",
    "we scan over the nmssm specific yukawa couplings and trilinear soft terms @xmath1 , @xmath9 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 as well as the effective @xmath6 parameter , and we obtain the regions in the nmssm parameter space that maximize @xmath36 in agreement with the considerations above .    in fig .  1 we show our results for the the upper bound on @xmath36 for @xmath72",
    ". the thick full line corresponds to @xmath73  gev , the thin full line to @xmath23  gev , both without imposing constraints on @xmath52 .    with the above soft terms ,",
    "the upper bound on @xmath36 in the nmssm is @xmath5  gev for @xmath74  gev .",
    "it is reached for @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78  gev , @xmath79  gev , and @xmath80  gev ( strictly speaking a certain range of values for @xmath9 , @xmath6 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 gives the same result for @xmath36 for these values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) . for @xmath81  gev ,",

    "indeed , along the full lines of fig .  1 the value of @xmath52 increases with @xmath0 up to several tev",
