    "the @xmath1cdm model is the simplest cosmological model that fits a varied set of observational data ; type ia supernova ( snia ) , baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) , cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) , growth of structure etc @xcite . in this setup",
    "the cosmological constant @xmath1 drives the current accelerated expansion of the universe , detected for the first time using type ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "although successful in fitting the data , the model is awkward in many ways : for example , we do not know the mechanism to produce such a constant in the first place .",
    "we also do not expect to live in a special epoch where the contribution of this constant is of the same order of magnitude than the non relativistic matter contribution .",
    "this problem in particular is known as the `` cosmic '' coincidence problem . from a theoretical point of view , it is most natural to think that this contribution comes from an evolving source ( with epoch ) whose connection with the universe expansion is under study .",
    "dark energy ( de ) is the name of this mysterious source @xcite .",
    "different de models have been proposed to provide the mechanism that explains the observational data .",
    "there are models where a new field component is assumed to fill the universe , known as quintessence @xcite , and models where the mechanism is triggered by using a modified gravity theory @xcite . in the absence of consensus regarding a theoretical description for cosmic acceleration",
    ", theorists have proposed using the equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the scale factor , as a useful phenomenological description @xcite . in this context in @xcite , using the constitution data set for snia @xcite , and the chevalier - polarski - linder ( cpl ) parameterization for @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 being free parameters to be fixed by observations , the authors found a reconstructed deceleration parameter that apparently shows a rapid variation at small redshift around @xmath8 .",
    "however , once the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data are added into the analysis , the best fit result changes completely , showing no sign of variation at the small redshift in agreement with what is expected in the @xmath1cdm model . in @xcite",
    "similar results were found , under the assumption of a flat universe using the union 2 data set @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we revisit this problem using the union 2 data set extending the analysis to allow for curved spacetime . in @xcite , using data from gas mass fraction in galaxy clusters @xmath9 , we encountered the same apparent behavior found previously using snia @xcite .",
    "snia are standardizable candles from which we measure the luminosity distance . in the case of the gas mass fraction",
    ", we measure the x - ray emission , which enable us to estimate the baryonic ( mostly gas ) and total mass , assuming the intracluster gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium , from which we measure the angular diameter distance to the cluster @xcite .",
    "because the @xmath9 data span a similar redshift range as the snia , but depends on a completely different physics , this finding is certainly intriguing .",
    "although the statistical significance of this effect is small , the consistency between the results using snia and @xmath9 , moves us to deepen the study of this effect at low redshift .",
    "we also studied the possible dependence of this result - a low redshift transition of the deceleration parameter - with different parameterizations .",
    "in @xcite we used five different types of parameterizations and the result was always consistent with that found using cpl .",
    "however , the analysis based on using @xmath10 increases the errors in the parameters we want to constrain .",
    "the problem with using @xmath10 as the focus of study was demonstrated in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the essential problem is the observational quantity , as the luminosity distance or the angular diameter distance , depends on @xmath10 through a double integral smearing out the information about @xmath10 itself and its time variation . as the @xmath1cdm model is by definition a model with a constant de density , in this work we focus on signals of a possible departure from this trend . in this context , as was explained in the previous paragraph , is not efficient to use @xmath10 or a particular parametrization of it ; instead , we work directly with the dark energy density , whatever that may be .",
    "this strategy was started in @xcite , and @xcite , where the authors demonstrated the advantage of using the energy density instead of the eos parameter as the main probe to constraint .",
    "in this paper we investigate the possibility of evolution of the dark energy density in light of recent data .",
    "we use gas mass fraction in clusters @xcite - 42 measurements of @xmath9 in clusters extracted from @xcite - and also type ia supernovae ( snia ) from the lick observatory supernova search ( loss ) compilation sample @xcite .",
    "we also consider the constraints obtained from bao and cmb .",
    "the bao measurements considered in our analysis are obtained from the wigglez experiment @xcite , the sdss dr7 bao distance measurements @xcite , and 6dfgs bao data @xcite .",
    "we also include background cmb information by using the planck data @xcite to probe the expansion history up to the last scattering surface .",
    "we have also perform the analysis using the wmap 9-yr covariance matrix from @xcite , with no significant changes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we describe what we have learned from the @xmath10 parametrization .",
    "then , we describe how to implement the interpolation method to constrain the de density model using the observational data available .",
    "after that , we present the results of our study , first using snia and @xmath9 data and then within a joint analysis .",
    "we end with a discussion of the results .",
    "observational cosmology is essentially based on quantities derived from the hubble function .",
    "for example , using both type ia supernova or galaxy cluster data , the key functions are written in terms of the comoving distance from the observer to the redshift @xmath11 given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 contains the cosmology .",
    "for example , for the case of the @xmath1cdm model the function is , @xmath14 here @xmath15 comprise both the baryonic and non baryonic dm .",
    "we know the radiation component is negligible at low redshift ; in fact , we know @xmath16 from @xcite .",
    "however , if we want to constrain our model using data from bao and cmb , we have to use it , because these probes refers to both the last scattering redshift and the drag epoch . in practice , by using the cpl parameterization ( [ cpl ] ) for the de component , and after testing it against the observational data , we get the best fit values of the parameters , which give us the best hubble function @xmath17 that agrees with the data . from it , following previous works @xcite , we reconstruct the deceleration parameter function @xmath18 in order to motivate the next section , we will repeat the calculation with recent data .",
    "we use gas mass fraction in clusters extracted from @xcite , and also type ia supernovae ( snia ) from the loss compilation sample @xcite . from now on we assume a spatially flat universe ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the snia data give the luminosity distance @xmath20 .",
    "we fit the snia with the cosmological model by minimizing the @xmath21 value defined by @xmath22 ^ 2}{\\sigma_{\\mu i}^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath23 + 25 $ ] is the theoretical value of the distance modulus , @xmath24 is the corresponding observed one , and @xmath25 is the error associated to it . as explained in @xcite , the error comprises three components : the uncertainty from light - curve fits , a component due to the peculiar velocity of each snia , and an intrinsic scatter term which depends on the sample ( see table 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "the gas mass fraction data we use span a redshift range @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath9 data are quoted for a flat @xmath1cdm reference cosmology with @xmath27 km s@xmath28mpc@xmath29 and @xmath30 . to obtain the restrictions we use the model function from @xcite : @xmath31^{3/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is a bias factor motivated by gas - dynamical simulations which suggest the the baryon fraction in clusters is slightly lower than for the universe as a whole . from @xcite @xmath33",
    "is obtained .",
    "following @xcite we adopt a gaussian prior on @xmath32 , taking into account systematic uncertainties , so we use @xmath34 . in the analysis we also use standard gaussian priors on @xmath35 and @xmath36 from planck and wmap polarization @xcite .",
    "the use of snia and @xmath9 data separately , as demonstrated in @xcite , generates a behavior that is consistent between them . for that reason , in what follows we show first the result considering both probes together . given the two data sets are consistent each other , we use the standard @xmath21 analysis . in the analysis ( see the details in appendix a ) we consider @xmath37 and @xmath32 as free parameters . as we mentioned , we have added gaussian priors for @xmath38 and @xmath32 . after the analysis the best fit values are those shown in table [ tab : table00 ] .",
    ".[tab : table00 ] the best fit values for the free parameters using snia + @xmath9 .",
    "see also fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3 ] . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     obtaining a decreasing de density as the redshift increases , as the one obtained here , would eventually lead us to get negative values for @xmath39 , as can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1 ] for @xmath40 .",
    "although this idea may seem contrary to common sense , a negative de density has been considered in the past .",
    "for example , in @xcite the author considered a model inspired from unimodular gravity , predicting fluctuations in the cosmological constant .",
    "these fluctuations of the cosmological `` constant '' are always of the order of the ambient density , and it is not strange that @xmath1 may eventually take negative values . also in this context and using the back - reaction approach the author of @xcite obtains a cosmological constant which oscillates about @xmath41 the total @xmath42 on hubble time scales .",
    "it is also interesting to mention the work done in @xcite .",
    "there the authors performed a study of an interacting dm / de model using a moderately general interaction term .",
    "one of their conclusions was that , based on their examples , a solution to the coincidence problem would require that the de density should take negative values in the past .",
    "once we consider the data from bao and cmb together with the already described snia and @xmath9 , we minimize the joint chi square , @xmath43 , where each element is defined in appendix a. in the conventional joint @xmath21 analysis , we weight each probe equally",
    ". this may be problematic if two data sets are mutually inconsistent @xcite .",
    "a well - motivated approach to assigning weights is the `` hyper - parameter '' method @xcite . in this approach",
    ", finding the best - fitting parameters requires us to minimize an effective @xmath21 given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 sums over all the data sets ( @xmath46 snia , bao , cmb , fgas ) , and @xmath47 is the number of data points in each data set . once the @xmath21 values have been obtained , we find the posterior distribution for the parameters using the conventional @xmath21 or the hyper - parameter version @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in table [ tab : table01 ] .",
    "a quadratic parametrization of this type was used by @xcite , where the authors used a sample with 192 snia in combination with cmb and lss data .",
    "unfortunately , the authors did not show the result using only snia data .",
    "when comparing their results with our analysis , considering snia , @xmath9 and both bao and cmb data , our results show smaller uncertainties and are more consistent with no change compared with them .",
    "in fact , their results indicate a growing de density with redshift at one sigma .",
    "we plot the de density as a function of redshift in fig.([fig : figure2 ] ) , with error propagation at one sigma .",
    "+ bao + cmb , we plot the de density as a function of redshift , with error propagation to one sigma including error correlation between the parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the result shows that the addition of these probes makes the reconstructed de density @xmath39 consistent with no evolution.,width=264 ]    it is very clear that the addition of bao and cmb data makes the evidence of evolution disappears .",
    "this is exactly what we discussed at the end of section ii , in the context of a cpl parameterization for @xmath10 . at this point",
    "it seems there is an intriguing connection between the previously found low redshift transition of the deceleration parameter @xmath51 , and a de density @xmath39 that decreases as the redshift increases .",
    "it is also interesting to mention that such a behavior  a low redshift transition of the deceleration parameter @xmath51 ( [ qdzeq ] )  was previously found first ( as far as we know ) by @xcite in the context of lemaitre - tolman - bondi inhomogeneous models . in that work , and in recent ones @xcite , the authors derived an effective deceleration parameter for void models , indicating that such a behavior of @xmath51 may be considered a signature for the existence of voids . furthermore , a decreasing de density with increasing redshift is also found in the recent bao data release by @xcite , where a tension between bao data and cmb is found .",
    "this tension reveals that in order to accommodate these new data it is not sufficient to go into models with non - zero curvature or a constant @xmath52 de , essentially because the data requires a decreasing @xmath53 while increasing @xmath54 .",
    "the intriguing result , assuming a flat universe with dark matter and de is that ( quoted from @xcite ) @xmath55 which shows this data seems to favor an evolving de density as we have found in this work using snia and @xmath9 . an evolving de density , as seems to be suggested by our study , not only means that the de contribution itself varies with time .",
    "this may also be produced by other means .",
    "for example , it can be produced by a locally inhomogeneous distribution of matter , like the previously mentioned example using ltb models .",
    "also , as we have mentioned on our discussion on negative de density , this can also be obtained by assuming an explicit interaction between dm and de ( see for example @xcite ) . after having uploaded a draft version of this paper to the web @xcite",
    ", several works have appeared whose results point in the same direction . in @xcite",
    "the authors use the bao data from the boss dr11 @xcite , along @xmath56 measurements at low redshift , finding a considerable tension with the standard @xmath1cdm model , implying a evolution for de . also in @xcite",
    ", the authors use the same data from boss to show that such a departure from the @xmath1cdm model can be accommodated assuming an interaction between dark matter and de , excluding the null interaction at 2@xmath57 .",
    "in this paper we have presented a study of possible signs of evolution of the de density in light of recent data .",
    "we use gas mass fraction in clusters - 42 measurements of @xmath9 in clusters extracted from @xcite - and also type ia supernovae data compiled in @xcite from the loss team .",
    "we also consider the constraints obtained by adding measurements from baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) and cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) .",
    "we have found  using snia and @xmath9 data  evidence that relates the previously found low redshift transition of the deceleration parameter to a decreasing de density evolution with increasing redshift .",
    "this result seems to confirm the tension between the data at low redshift and those from cmb .",
    "this result is also consistent with a recent anisotropic bao measurement of boss dr11 @xcite , which shows that the data appear to prefer a decreasing de density with increasing redshift .",
    "although the statistical significance of the result is low  this manifests up to @xmath58  it is interesting to focus on what the low redshift data are telling us . because we expect the de component to be dominant at recent ( low redshift ) epoch , and the fact that now data from snia , gas mass fraction and the recent bao dr11 results all seem to agree on this peculiar behavior at low redshift , we may conclude that something in our near neighborhood is producing this result .",
    "this conclusion is also reinforced with the intriguing similarity between our finding and the result using ltb inhomogeneous model , where the effective deceleration parameter shows the same transition at low redshift , assuming we live inside a void . in summary ,",
    "the analysis in this work suggests either ( i ) we live inside a void , or ( ii ) there is an evolving de model that produces rapid changes at low redshift .",
    "so , it is clear that a careful study of low redshift behavior is needed to enlighten our understanding of de .",
