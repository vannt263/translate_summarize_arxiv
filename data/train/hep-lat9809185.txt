    "a number of studies have recently been reported exploring these aspects of the full qcd static potential @xcite .",
    "recently the cp - pacs collaboration has started a systematic effort toward a full qcd simulation with two flavors of dynamical quarks@xcite . in this article",
    "we present results on the static potential calculated as a part of this program .",
    "the cp - pacs simulation of full qcd is carried out for three values of lattice spacing in the range @xmath9@xmath2  gev and four different sea quark masses corresponding to @xmath6@xmath7 .",
    "an rg - improved gauge action and a tadpole - improved sw clover action are employed to reduce discretization errors .",
    "light hadron masses are calculated at every fifth trajectories @xcite , while the static potential calculation uses a subset of the configurations as listed in table  [ tab : param ] where other relevant run parameters are also given .",

    "errors are estimated by the jack - knife method with a bin size corresponding to 50 hmc trajectories .",
    "we also carry out a measurement of the potential with 100 configurations in quenched qcd at @xmath26 to compare with full qcd results obtained at @xmath27 .    at @xmath15",
    ", we calculate the static - light meson propagator using an exponential smearing function for the source .",
    "the mass of the static - light meson is extracted by making fits over an interval @xmath28@xmath29  fm .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : scale ] the lattice spacings determined from @xmath31 , the string tension @xmath23 ( where we employ the value @xmath32 gev ) and the sommer scale @xmath33 at each sea quark mass on the @xmath5 lattice are plotted as a function of @xmath34 .",
    "the values extrapolated quadratically in @xmath34 to the chiral limit are also shown .",

    ", the leading @xmath38 scaling violation is expected to be small@xcite .",
    "the flat behavior of the ratio supports this expectation , and also suggests that the remaining higher order contributions are small as well .",
    "we then adopt a constant fit , and find @xmath39 as an estimate of the continuum value .",
    "if we employ @xmath40  gev , this leads to @xmath41  gev , which is now a prediction of our full qcd simulation .",
    "this value is about 5% larger than 0.44 gev used in fig .",
    "[ fig : scale ] .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : potential ] the potential data @xmath42 are compared with twice the static - light meson mass @xmath43 on the @xmath4 lattice at the lightest sea quark mass .",
    "the potential result crosses @xmath43 at around 1  fm and continues to increase with @xmath44 . we find a similar behavior at other sea quark masses and lattice spacings .",
    "thus our results do not show any indication of a flattening of the potential expected from a pair creation of quarks , similar to those of previous studies@xcite .",
    "a possible interpretation of this result is that the overlap of the wilson loop operator with the state of a static - light meson pair is small . in a simplified picture that the contribution of the meson pair to the wilson loop is given by a static - light meson propagating along the loop",
    ", the overlap is given by a factor @xmath45 where @xmath46 with @xmath47 is the binding energy of meson .",
    "hence the contribution of the meson pair dominates over that of the string state only for sufficiently large @xmath48 satisfying @xmath49 . for numerical parameters appropriate for fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] , we find this condition to be met only for @xmath50 fm at @xmath51fm , which is far too large for practical potential measurements . devising an operator which does not suffer from the small overlap problem",
    "is needed to observe the string breaking effect .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : alpha ] we plot results for the coulomb coefficient @xmath24 obtained on the @xmath5 lattice as a function of sea quark mass using @xmath11 ( filled circles ) .",
    "the right - most open circle is the result in quenched qcd at @xmath26 for which @xmath52  gev fixed by @xmath32  gev matches with the value @xmath53  gev of the full qcd run .",
    "as expected , the full qcd results are larger than the quenched value , and they increase as the sea quark becomes lighter .",
    "a simple estimate of the magnitude of shift of @xmath24 from quenched to full qcd may be made in the following way@xcite : one starts with the quenched value , runs it from @xmath54 down to @xmath55 mev using the 2-loop @xmath56 function with @xmath57 , and then runs back to @xmath58 with @xmath59 . the result shown by the horizontal line in fig .",
