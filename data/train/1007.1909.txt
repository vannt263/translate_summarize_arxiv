    "quiescent prominences are globally highly stable structures that exist in the corona for days or even weeks .",
    "the characteristic density is @xmath1 and the characteristic temperature is @xmath2 , which are two orders of magnitude larger and smaller , respectively , than that of the surrounding corona ( @xcite ) . using this value for the temperature the pressure scale height can be calculated to be @xmath3 .",
    "quiescent prominences form over polarity inversion lines between areas of opposite magnetic flux ( @xcite ) and have a magnetic field strength between @xmath4 ( @xcite ) and a gas pressure of @xmath5 ( @xcite ) giving a plasma @xmath6 .",
    "the magnetic reynolds number of a quiescent prominence is @xmath7 .    despite the global stability of the quiescent prominence",
    ", there are a number of observations that highlight that quiescent prominences are locally highly dynamic .",
    "@xcite reported downflows along vertical filaments , interpreted as downflows along magnetic field lines driven by gravity , of the order of a few @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite reported flows in a dark filament , observed on disk , that propagated predominately downward with a velocity @xmath9 .",
    "vorticies inside the prominence of approximately @xmath10 in size with rotation rates @xmath11 were reported by @xcite .",
    "recent observations of quiescent prominences provided by solar optical telescope ( @xcite ) on the hinode satellite ( @xcite ) have shown that on an even smaller small scale , quiescent prominences are highly dynamic structures undergoing constant evolution . @xcite",
    "found dark upflows , of width @xmath12 , rising from the boundary between cavities that formed at the base of the prominence .",
    "these dark upflows would rise through a height of around @xmath13 , before forming a mushroom cap profile .    from the above",
    ", we can see that globally quiescent prominences are extremely stable structures , but on a smaller scale they are highly dynamic and can not be considered to be in equilibrium .",
    "one of the main problems in prominence physics is understanding how to capture such dynamics in prominence models .",
    "one possible reason for the formation of the localised dynamics inside the globally stable prominence could result from the partial ionisation of the prominence plasma .",
    "it has been shown that the ionisation fraction of quiescent prominences is around @xmath14 ( @xcite ) .",
    "as this is not a fully ionised plasma , there will constantly be neutral flows inside the prominence , that would stop the formation of any equilibrium that was not dynamic .",
    "this has been studied observationally by @xcite , who found evidence of cross - field diffusion of neutral particles , which can be viewed as one mechanism to explain mass loss from a quiescent prominence .",
    "such observations imply that neutral dynamics are playing a role in the evolution of quiescent prominences .",
    "the impact of partially ionised plasma manifests itself in a 1-fluid model in the form of cowling resistivity ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the impact of cowling resistivity ( composed of the resistive and ambipolar terms ) on the magnetic field has already been studied in a wide range of situations .",
    "the formation of sharp structures by ambipolar diffusion created by anti - parallel magnetic fields was studied by @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of ambipolar diffusion was found to greatly enhance the growth rate for the tearing instability at points where the sign of the magnetic field reverses ( @xcite ) .",
    "the three dimensional case is more complicated but ambipolar diffusion was shown to decrease the tearing timescale when the lorentz force works to compress the plasma .",
    "cowling resistivity has been discussed as a potential driver in forming coronal nonlinear force free fields in the chromosphere from photospheric fields ( @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown that on a time scale @xmath15 the magnetic field would rearrange itself forming a nonlinear force free field .",
    "@xcite explained how the ambipolar terms are effective at damping the propagation of alfvn - like wave modes .",
    "this study looks at how the prominence magnetic field , based upon the field used in the kippenhahn - schlueter ( k - s ) prominence model ( @xcite ) evolves under the influence of cowling resistivity .",
    "the k - s prominence model is based on the simple idea of supporting plasma against gravity through the lorentz force via magnetic tension .",
    "this model has been shown to be linearly stable for ideal mhd perturbations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite developed a modified k - s prominence model , created by using the k - s model to describe one sheet inside the prominence and then using an array of sheets with varying properties to create an entire prominence .",
    "this prominence model produced constant flows associated with a structure in local equilibrium but globally not in equilibrium that matched well with observations of flows in prominences .",
    "@xcite discuss the effect of a constant diffusion on the modified k - s model and showed how reconnection could drive a net upward movement of magnetic field associated with a net downward flow of mass .",
    "the inclusion of cowling resistivity and how this effects the current sheet profile of the k - s model are yet to be investigated . as",
    "the ratio of the cowling resistivity to the spitzer resistivity in quiescent prominences is @xmath16 ( i.e. the ambipolar terms dominate ) , the timescale of the deformation of the magnetic field would be greatly reduced through the inclusion of neutral dynamics .",
    "figure [ init ] shows the k - s prominence model magnetic field configuration with a fluid made up of neutral and charged particles .",
    "as the neutrals do not directly feel the magnetic field , they will be able to flow out of the current sheet across the magnetic field ( dashed arrows show direction of motion ) , as the is no longer an equilibrium the charged particles are advected by the lorentz force ( solid arrows ) .",
    "the evolution of the magnetic field of the k - s model under cowling resistivity will provide an insight into the nature of prominences and whether it is possible for them to form an equilibrium .",
    "this can then be used to shed some light on how to connect the large scale stability created in prominence models with the local dynamism observed in prominences .",
    "in  2 we present the numerical method and in  3 we present the results and use these to perform an estimate of the tearing timescale in the k - s model . in ",
    "4 we present a summary and a discussion outlining the physical meaning behind the results and their implications for quiescent prominences .",
    "the equations for the magnetic field in the k - s prominence model are as follows : @xmath17 where the x direction is across the prominence ( @xmath18 is the centre of the prominence ) , the y direction ( the direction of the current ) is along the prominence and the z direction is the vertical direction , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the pressure scale height .",
    "as this study focuses purely on the effect of cowling resistivity on the magnetic field , so the pressure scale height does not have any physical meaning in this setting . to address this",
    ", we normalised the characteristic length scale of the current sheet to be equal to @xmath22 , i.e. @xmath23 .",
    "this gives @xmath24    the induction equation including cowling resistivity is as follows ( @xcite ) : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the spitzer resistivity and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote the neutral fraction and the friction coefficient respectively .",
    "we use a 1.5d ( @xmath30 ) version of this equation , and taking into account that there is no @xmath31 component due to the geometry of the problem and that @xmath32 must remain constant to preserve @xmath33 , equation [ cow ] becomes @xmath34 this work is only concerned with the effect of the diffusion , so the effect of advection of the magnetic field is neglected .",
    "this assumption can be justified as initially the system is in equilibrium , so for the initial @xmath35 then the dynamics will be dominated by this term .",
    "this is similar to processes observed in molecular cloud fragmentation under cowling resistivity ( @xcite ) . for any evolution after this time , the results from this paper will only provide a handle on the dynamics of the system .",
    "also when using typical values for quiescent prominences @xmath36 , so it is possible to neglect @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , this work only presents the solution to the following equation @xmath37 the cowling resistivity profile is taken to be @xmath38 apart from in section ( [ late ] ) where a spatially and temporally variable profile is considered .",
    "the time scale is normalised to the cowling resistivity timescale @xmath39 , the length scale to @xmath22 and the resistivity by @xmath40 .    to solve the induction equation , we use a central difference scheme that forms part of a two step lax - wendroff scheme based on the scheme presented in @xcite .",
    "the calculations were performed on a grid with @xmath41 grid points , unless otherwise stated , where @xmath42 .",
    "the outer boundary is a free boundary and the inner boundary a reflective symmetric boundary , in the appendix the case where the outer boundary is a fixed boundary is discussed .",
    "to analyze the temporal evolution of the magnetic field , we perform a series of simulations on a magnetic field as described by equation [ eqn ] and [ eqn2 ] , for a range of values of @xmath43 .",
    "we use a domain of size @xmath44 $ ] , over a timespan of @xmath45 .",
    "figure [ evol ] shows the evolution of the current sheet and @xmath46 for ( top ) @xmath47 and ( bottom ) @xmath48 .",
    "the solid , dashed , dotted and three dots + dashed lines show the distribution at @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively .",
    "the thick dashed line denotes the power @xmath51 for the current and @xmath52 for the magnetic field .",
    "the thick horizontal line shows @xmath53 .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the current sheet forms two distinct sections .",
    "the first where @xmath54 $ ] , i.e. @xmath55 , and the second where @xmath56 $ ] , i.e. @xmath57 .",
    "the reason for this split in behaviour comes from the definition of the cowling resistivity , @xmath58 as the term @xmath59 is a constant , it will work as a uniform resistivity which drives current sheet thickening . whereas the @xmath60 term is a variable in @xmath61 , so",
    "if the field had no @xmath32 component , this would drive thinning of the current sheet ( @xcite ) .",
    "it can be shown by simple integration that such diffusion results in the current sheet forming a power law distribution @xmath62 , and as a result the magnetic field forms a power law distribution where @xmath63 .",
    "as both these processes are working , if @xmath64 there must be some point across the current sheet where they are equal , forming a new characteristic width of the current sheet .",
    "for the case where @xmath47 ( figure [ evol ] top ) , current sheet thinning occurs and after @xmath35 the current sheet has formed the power law distribution described above . throughout the evolution of the current sheet ,",
    "this power law component can be clearly seen at all times .",
    "the same can be said for the magnetic field distribution . for the case",
    "where @xmath48 ( figure [ evol ] bottom ) , current sheet thickening and current sheet thinning behaviour can both be observed .",
    "the inner part of the current sheet approximately undergoes constant resistive thickening , maintaining a flat current profile , and the outer part locally appears to form a power law distribution but not to the same extent as the @xmath47 case .",
    "the current sheet thinning behaviour does not continue for an extended period of time , as shown by the later stages of the evolution in figure [ evol ] bottom .",
    "though the dynamics displayed by the magnetic field are not those of a constant resistivity process , no clear power law distribution forms .",
    "we found that the temporal evolution of this new characteristic width , and as a result the magnetic field , can be divided into two separate stages .",
    "the initial stage as that where approximations of the evolution based on the initial magnetic field distribution still hold .",
    "the initial evolution of the magnetic field is determined by the ratio @xmath53 and the initial current sheet half width @xmath22 .",
    "inserting the definition of cowling resistivity ( equation [ cowres ] ) into the induction equation ( equation [ induct ] ) , gives @xmath65 .\\ ] ] assuming that @xmath66 s.t .",
    "@xmath67 , it is possible to form a comparison of the two components of the diffusion term .",
    "@xmath68 this equation can be simplified to give @xmath69 from the definition of @xmath70 .",
    "we define the value of @xmath61 found here ( @xmath71 ) , as a new characteristic width of the current sheet , where @xmath72 it can be seen that this lengthscale is independent of the resistivity profile assumed .",
    "figure [ balance ] shows the evolution of @xmath73 in time .",
    "it can clearly be seen that this approximation holds for a timespan of @xmath74 and for the range @xmath75 .    the above range results from comparing the following terms : @xmath76 as @xmath32 is constant , @xmath77 giving @xmath78 which gives @xmath79 .",
    "therefore any marginal case will occur when this relation approximately holds .",
    "such evolution is well described by the @xmath80 case . as can clearly be seen in figure [ evol ] ,",
    "the point at which @xmath81 initially , the value at @xmath35 and the linear estimate are approximately the same value .    as stated above , this approximation falls down in the case where @xmath82 and @xmath83 . as the cowling resistivity is defined as @xmath84 , when @xmath85 then @xmath86 . in this case",
    "we find that the linear stage is defined by current sheet thinning as found by @xcite .",
    "this case is well followed by the @xmath87 case , as shown in figure [ evol ] . though the prediction matches well with the initial value of @xmath61 where @xmath81 , the value at @xmath35 is completely different .",
    "the current sheet undergoes thinning , and at @xmath35 we have a current sheet half width that is @xmath88 of the prediction .    for the case where @xmath89 the linear approximation does not hold any more as the new characteristic current sheet half width can only be defined for the case where @xmath90 , because @xmath91 .",
    "the behaviour of the system can be understood in the same way as used when @xmath92 , if @xmath93 then @xmath94 .",
    "this works in a similar fashion to a constant spitzer resistivity , which would diffuse the current sheet causing thickening to occur .      in the later stage ,",
    "the presence of the constant horizontal field dominates the dynamics .",
    "it can be seen in figure [ balance ] that the behaviour of the system changes dramatically from the initial stage . in all cases",
    "current sheet thickening occurs independent of the value of @xmath53 .",
    "the current sheet thickening is driven at a rate @xmath95 , which is analogous to current sheet thickening through uniform resistivity applied to a @xmath96 function current sheet .",
    "it has been shown that the half width of a @xmath96 function current sheet s temporal evolution under constant resistivity can be described by @xmath97 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the results presented so far have assumed a constant cowling resistivity . in a quiescent prominence",
    ", the cowling resistivity would vary as a function of @xmath61 as the density and ionisation fraction vary from coronal values to the values at the heart of the prominence . to create a simple representation of this , under the assumption of constant gravity and hydrostatic equilibrium we have : @xmath98 from this we can assume that @xmath99 can provide an approximation of the prominence cowling resistivity profile .",
    "figure ( [ varet ] ) shows the comparison in behaviour between the constant resistivity and the variable resistivity case . as predicted the initial evolution",
    "does not depend greatly on the resistivity profile .",
    "the later evolution , the system takes a power law distribution @xmath100 .",
    "even with this , it can be seen that up until @xmath101 ( approximately the lifetime of a prominence ) , the current sheet width for both systems is approximately the same .",
    "this allows the results obtained with the constant resistivity to be applied as general results .",
    "a discussion about the effect of the boundary is presented in the appendix .",
    "the formula to calculate the growth rate for the tearing instability given by fkr theory ( @xcite ) is @xmath102 , where the @xmath103 symbol denotes that this is the effective value , i.e. calculated using the current sheet half width as the length scale and @xmath104 .",
    "@xcite showed numerically that if the constant @xmath105 approximation is not used the growth rate is @xmath106 . using the most unstable wavelength , @xmath107 ,",
    "the fastest growth rate becomes @xmath108 .",
    "if we take @xmath109 for a current sheet half - width defined as @xmath110 , i.e. that used in the k - s model , and a global magnetic reynolds number of @xmath111 , we get a tearing time of @xmath112 . using the new current sheet half width found in this work , @xmath113 ,",
    "the tearing time becomes @xmath114 .",
    "this result , though , does not take into account the effect of the stabilizing effect of the horizontal field .",
    "the effect of the horizontal field , i.e. a component of the magnetic field the is across the current sheet , was studied in relation to the k - s prominence model by @xcite , where it was found that for values @xmath115 the growth rate of the instability scales as @xmath116 which would give a tearing time of the order of @xmath117 in quiescent prominences .",
    "a similar result was obtained by @xcite in relation to the tearing instability in the earth s magneto - tail .",
    "their result implies that as @xmath118 gets larger , the transition of the growth rate from @xmath119 to @xmath120 happens at smaller values of @xmath121 .",
    "for example , for @xmath122 this transition happens at @xmath123 .",
    "as such weak horizontal fields would be unrealistic in quiescent prominences , it is very unlikely that the tearing instability could occur without an outside process driving it .",
    "@xcite showed that the tearing instability could be excited in such magnetic fields if driven by an outside force , in their case provided by short wavelengths fast mode waves .",
    "we believe that thinning of the current sheet caused by cowling resistivity could also allow the tearing instability to occur .    using the new current sheet widths found ,",
    "it will be possible to make an estimate for the tearing instability timescale in a quiescent prominence , this estimate is shown in figure [ timescale ] .",
    "the solid line denotes the estimate for the tearing timescale based on the current sheet half width from the k - s model , the dashed line denotes the tearing timescale based on the linear estimate for the current sheet half width under cowling resistivity and the stars denote the tearing timescale for the current sheet half width found from the simulation results , these are taken at when @xmath124 .",
    "figure [ timescale ] clearly shows that the inclusion of cowling resistivity reduces the tearing timescale when @xmath125 .",
    "the cowling resistivity timescale is approximately @xmath126 , during which time we would expect the magnetic field to have restructured itself due to the flow of the neutral particles , therefore any tearing time that is longer than this can be viewed as unrealistic . from these results , when we include cowling resistivity , we can say that for the case where @xmath127 , it is possible that tearing could occur . whereas , when we do not include the effect of cowling resistivity , it is only possible where @xmath128 , that is to say , unrealistically small values for the horizontal field component .",
    "based on this result , we feel that the inclusion of neutral dynamics could be very important when studying quiescent prominences",
    ". however , when applied to active region prominences , i.e. those with strong horizontal fields , the timescale for the instability is around @xmath129 so would not be able to occur inside the life time of the prominence , so such dynamics may not be important .",
    "one of the big problems in understanding quiescent prominence dynamics is explaining the highly dynamic features that are seen in the prominence using a model that has been designed to explain the global stability of the prominence .",
    "until now , it has been commonplace to ignore the physics that are involved with partially ionized plasmas .",
    "using values that are typical for quiescent prominences gives timescale for these effects of approximately @xmath130 days , which is shorter than the average lifetime of a quiescent prominence .",
    "therefore the physical effects from partially ionized plasma could be very important for creating the highly dynamical features seen in quiescent prominences .    in this work",
    "we have shown the impact of including the neutral component in a 1-fluid model , by using the addition of the cowling resistivity to the induction equation , to understand how the magnetic field in the kippenhahn - schlueter prominence model behaves .",
    "we have shown that the temporal evolution of the magnetic field , characterized by the evolution of the current sheet , which is defined by the value of @xmath61 such that @xmath131 the evolution can be divided into two clear regimes , the initial evolution which can be determined by the ratio @xmath53 and the later evolution where the current sheet thickens with @xmath132 .    without performing full 3d mhd simulations that include the cowling resistivity , it is impossible to fully describe the dynamics that would be created inside the k - s model , though these relations provide a handle on how the model will evolve . as the plasma will flow in the opposite direction to the lorentz force , for @xmath133 the tension force dominates the magnetic pressure in the k - s model .",
    "this implies that the plasma will flow downward . for @xmath134",
    "the magnetic pressure force dominates the tension force , therefore there will be an outflow occurring along the @xmath61-direction .",
    "this study has allowed estimates of the tearing time scale to be calculated for the k - s model , giving the ratio @xmath135 at which tearing is possible .",
    "it is clear that the inclusion of cowling resistivity radically reduces the tearing time scale in the k - s model . as a result , the range of values of @xmath135 at which we are likely to have tearing occur increases from @xmath136 to @xmath137 .",
    "this implies that any numerical simulations of the tearing instability in solar prominences should include cowling resistivity .",
    "this result , when applied to solar prominences , could give a handle on the magnetic field strength at positions where plasmoid ejection is observed .",
    "it is very important to extend this study to include fluid effects by solving the full mhd equations .",
    "the results in this study for the initial evolution of the magnetic field ( @xmath138 ) should match well with any results from mhd simulations , but after that the fluid effects should become important .",
    "this is because @xmath139 .",
    "therefore , once the flows have been initiated by the decoupling of the magnetic field from the plasma via the cowling resistivity , these flows could have a significant effect on the results . in this work",
    ", we found that the later evolution of the magnetic field for @xmath140 was defined by a current sheet thickening with @xmath132 , without the inclusion of fluid flow this can only be viewed as a handle on the potential dynamics of the system . in reality ,",
    "2-fluid simulations with ionisation from coronal x - rays would be necessary to truly understand the dynamics of the system .",
    "how this is effected by fluid flow would be a very interesting future research topic .",
    "the authors would like to thank the staff and students of kwasan and hida observatories for their support and comments .",

    "hi is supported by the grant - in - aid for young scientists ( b , 22740121 ) .",
    "in the main body of this work , the temporal evolution of the current sheet was discussed . however , for numerical simulations it is important to know the effect of the boundary on the system . as stated previously , a free boundary condition ( @xmath141 ) was used for the calculations presented in this work .",
    "we can simply calculate the steady state formed with this boundary condition by rewriting equation [ cow ] and neglecting the spitzer resistivity .",
    "we can write @xmath142\\ ] ] where @xmath143 .",
    "therefore the effect of cowling resistivity can be understood to be equivalent to advecting the magnetic field in the direction of the @xmath144 vector , which in terms of the equation of motion is the lorentz force .",
    "therefore , in general , any steady state of the magnetic field will be the state where @xmath145 , if the boundary allows such a state to be formed .",
    "the free boundary condition used in this study allows the magnetic field to relax to a @xmath146 state , i.e. @xmath147 leaving a constant horizontal field . a symmetric boundary would allow the same process to occur",
    ". a fixed boundary ( @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the value of @xmath61 at the boundary ) would not allow such a state to be reached , because the angle of the magnetic field at the boundary is fixed .",
    "therefore , any steady state that is reached will be such that @xmath66 such that @xmath150 . in this subsection",
    ", we will investigate the steady state formed when using a fixed boundary .",
    "figure [ balancesteady ] shows the temporal evolution of @xmath151 for a solid boundary ( @xmath149 ) at @xmath152 & @xmath153 .",
    "the dashed and solid lines correspond to the case where @xmath154 for @xmath155 and @xmath153 respectively , and the thick dashed and thick solid lines correspond to the case where @xmath156 for @xmath155 and @xmath153 respectively .",
    "it is clear that once the steady state has been reached a characteristic current sheet half width is formed that it has a dependence on the value of @xmath149 and @xmath157 .",
    "analysis of the results shows that the current sheet half width of the steady state @xmath158 .",
    "as shown in section [ bound ] , a steady state can be formed whilst the field lines remain curved .",
    "this is only applicable for a fixed boundary , which does not apply to solar prominences as the magnetic field as the surrounding corona would act like a free boundary due to its low density .",
    "this type of magnetic field equilibrium could be applicable to the emergence of flux tubes or sheets that rise from below the photosphere into the solar atmosphere , where the photosphere can act as a fixed boundary .",
    "the small ionisation fraction in the chromosphere means that if the emergence of the flux tube is sufficiently slow , the structure of the magnetic field could be greatly altered to form an equilibrium .",

    "<S> we show that initially the evolution is determined by the ratio of the horizontal and vertical magnetic fields , which gives current sheet thinning ( thickening ) when this ratio is large ( small ) and a marginal case where a new characteristic current sheet length scale is formed . after a timespan greater than the cowling resistivity time , the current sheet thickens as a power law of @xmath0 independent of the ratio of the field strengths . </S>",
    "<S> these results imply that when cowling resistivity is included in the model , the tearing instability time scale is reduced by more than one order of magnitude when the ratio of the horizontal field to the vertical field is 20% or less . </S>",
    "<S> these results imply that , over the course of its lifetime , the structure of the prominence can be significantly altered by cowling resistivity , and in some cases will allow the tearing instability to occur . </S>"
