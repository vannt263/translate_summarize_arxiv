    "it follows that the dicke model offers a potential setting for investigations of quantum critical behavior , quantum chaos , and quantum entanglement .",

    "our scheme uses cavity - plus - laser mediated raman transitions between a pair of stable atomic ground states , thereby avoiding spontaneous emission .",
    "while cavity loss can not be similarly avoided , it should be possible to achieve cavity qed conditions in which the dissipation rate from the cavity mode is much less than the parameters of the dicke model .",
    "in fact , the presence of cavity loss constitutes an important and essential aspect of the work presented here : output light from the cavity provides a readily measurable signal from which an experimenter can learn , rather directly , about the properties of the system .",
