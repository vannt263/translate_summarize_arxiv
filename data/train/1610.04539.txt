    "we briefly discuss our results .",
    "for studying nonlinear waves in a liquid with gas bubbles we use the homogeneous model @xcite .",
    "we consider a bubble ",
    "liquid mixture as a homogeneous media with an average pressure , an average density and an average velocity .",
    "we do not take into account interaction , formation , destruction and coalescence of bubbles .",
    "thus , the amount of gas bubbles in the mass unit is the constant @xmath0 .",
    "we assume that all gas bubbles are spherical .",
    "the nearly isothermal approximation @xcite is used for the modeling of heat transfer between a gas in bubbles and a liquid . in this approximation",
    "it is supposed that the temperature of the liquid is not changed and is equal to the temperature of the mixture in the unperturbed state ( @xmath1)@xcite . we consider influence of the liquid viscosity only at the interphase boundary .",
    "also we take into consideration the weak compressibility of the liquid using the keller  miksis equation for the description of bubbles dynamics @xcite .",
    "also we consider the one  dimensional case . in these assumptions",
    "we can use the following system of equations for the description of nonlinear waves in the liquid with gas bubbles @xcite :    [ eq : main_dim_system ] @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5\\bigg\\},\\hfill \\label{eq : pressure_in_bubble}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath6 @xmath7    we use the following notations in system : @xmath8 is cartesian coordinate , @xmath9 is time , @xmath10 is the density of the bubble ",

    "the first two equations from system are the continuity equation and the euler equation for the mixture .",
    "let us note that at the derivation of equation for bubbles dynamics the liquid viscosity at the inter  phase boundary , the slight liquid compressibility and surface tension were taken into consideration @xcite .",
    "equation was obtained in @xcite under assumption that the gas temperature in the bubble deviates little from the temperature in the unperturbed state .",

    "liquid mixture .",
    "varying the parameter @xmath60 we obtain nonlinear differential equations governing nonlinear waves on corresponding time and length scales .",
    "also the main influence of the different physical properties ( e.g. dissipation , dispersion ) corresponds to different values of @xmath60 . in this way we can reveal main physical properties affecting nonlinear waves at the corresponding length and time scales .",

    "the first one is the case of the main influence of dissipation ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the other one is the case of the main influence of dispersion ( @xmath65 ) .",

    "one can obtain known equations for the waves in liquid with gas bubbles that is the burgers equation and the burgers  korteweg  de vries equation . at the next order",
    "we find new equations for more accurate description of nonlinear waves . also taking into consideration high order terms with respect to the small parameter we reveal new physical effects affecting nonlinear waves propagation .",

    "we see that the phase and the group speed of nonlinear waves is the result of the interaction between the dispersion and the dissipation .",
    "one can take into account this phenomenon only if we consider high order corrections to the burgers equation .",

    "let us consider the dependence of the linear damping coefficient ( @xmath78 ) on the wave number at different values of equilibrium bubble radius @xmath17 for water with bubbles of carbon dioxide . from fig.[fig:1.1 ]",
