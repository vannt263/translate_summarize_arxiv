    "bright galaxies are known to obey well - defined sets of scaling relations linking their structural , kinematic and stellar population properties . during the past decade , a new generation of observational surveys based on optical integral - field unit ( ifu ) spectroscopy  and supplemented with spectroscopic and imaging data covering a wide wavelength range  has greatly improved our understanding of these high - luminosity galaxies .",
    "notable examples of such surveys include sauron @xcite , atlas@xmath4  @xcite and califa @xcite .",
    "the atlas@xmath4  survey , which carefully examined the structure , kinematics , gas - content and stellar populations of 260 early - type galaxies ( etgs ) using the sauron instrument on the 4.2 m william herschel telescope , has provided many new insights into the formation and evolution of galaxies belonging to this broad class . employing a @xmath5-band magnitude selection , complete down of @xmath6 for morphologically etgs within 42  mpc , atlas@xmath4  thoroughly sampled the etg population down to a stellar mass of @xmath7 .",
    "as it happens , this limit coincides roughly with the well - known inflection point in the mass - size and mass - surface brightness relations that are sometimes taken to separate the etgs into high- and low - mass classes ( see , e.g. , figure 16 of @xcite ) .",
    "the low - mass etgs themselves appear to subdivide into separate branches : diffuse and compact ( see , e.g. , fig .  2 of @xcite ) suggesting different origins .",
    "based on their simulations , diffuse low - mass etgs are thought be formed mainly through tidal interactions in a weak field , whereas compact low - mass galaxies would be the low - mass counter parts of massive etgs .",
    "it is difficult from imaging alone to assess the extent to which low - mass etgs have properties similar to high - mass etgs , and whether or not they have experienced similar formation and evolutionary processes ( e.g. , hierarchical merging , violent relaxation , cold gas accretion , tidal stirring and/or stripping , ram pressure stripping , etc ) . whereas strong evidence , both from observations  @xcite and simulations  @xcite exists about the importance of tidal stripping in the formation of low - mass etgs , the respective roles of mergers and gas accretion is not clear yet , while the latter are prominent for more massive etgs . in clusters ,",
    "ram - pressure stripping may also be an efficient driver for the transformation of late - type star - forming galaxies into low - mass etgs @xcite .",
    "there have been several recent attempts to provide an initial characterization of the kinematics and stellar populations of low - mass etgs using long - slit or ifu spectroscopy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these studies have focused almost entirely on low - mass etgs that have generally been classified as de or ds0 types ( i.e. , comparatively diffuse objects of both the nucleated and non - nucleated varieties ) .",
    "these are obvious first targets as such morphological classes make up the great majority of low - mass etgs .",
    "a general finding from these studies is that low - mass etgs show a surprising variety of kinematic structures : features that are remarkably similar to what has been observed in the more massive etgs .",
    "the low - mass etgs are also found to exhibit a wide range in age and metallicity .",
    "thus , in terms of their stellar content , kinematics and structural parameters , they seem to bridge the gap between the faintest etgs ( such as the  dwarf spheroidals \" found in the local group ) and the massive etgs studied by atlas@xmath4 .",
    "still , the number of low - mass etgs that have been examined using high - quality spectroscopy remains small , and existing samples include almost none of the compact ( i.e. , high - surface brightness ) etgs that appear to form a second branch in the photometric scaling relations .",
    "although such systems are known to be very rare ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , a full understanding of etgs will remain elusive until the nature of these objects can be understood with the benefit of high - quality ( and preferably two - dimensional ) spectroscopy .    in this paper",
    ", we carry out a spectroscopic survey of low - mass , compact etgs in the virgo cluster using ifu spectroscopy acquired with the 8.1 m gemini north telescope .",
    "our target galaxies have been selected from both the pioneering photographic survey of @xcite and from our own next generation virgo cluster survey ( ngvs ; @xcite ) .",
    "the ngvs is a large ( @xmath8 900 hours ) program carried out with the 3.6 m canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) between 2008 and 2013 .",
    "the survey used the megacam instrument to perform panoramic imaging of the virgo cluster , from its core to virial radius , in the @xmath9 filters ( a total area of @xmath10 100 deg@xmath11 ) . for a subset of the survey area , @xmath12- and @xmath13-band imaging",
    "is also available ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the point - source completeness limit for the survey is roughly @xmath14  mag ( 10@xmath15 ) , with a corresponding surface brightness limit of @xmath16 29 mag  arcsec@xmath17 ( 2@xmath15 above sky level ) .",
    "the ngvs image quality is also excellent , with a median @xmath18-band seeing of fwhm @xmath19",
    ". a key deliverable from the ngvs will be an updated catalog of confirmed and probable virgo cluster members , including a complete census of the low - mass compact etgs that are the focus of this paper .",
    "other papers in the ngvs series related to the general topics considered here include studies of the globular cluster populations in virgo @xcite , the dynamical properties of star clusters , ultra - compact dwarfs ( ucds ) and galaxies in the cluster core ( @xcite ; zhang et  al .",
    "2015 ( submitted ) ) , a census of ucds in virgo s three main subclusters and an examination of tidal stripping as a possible origin for at least some ucds ( liu  et  al .  in preparation ) , and investigations into ongoing tidal interactions of galaxies within the cluster environment @xcite .",

    "the majority of these are classified as low - luminosity etgs , thus making them a very significant morphological group by number , and an important sample for understanding galaxy evolution in dense environments .",
    "we selected our targets from @xcite as well as from the ngvs .",
    "we first identified virgo etgs @xcite with @xmath23 , and then selected compact , high surface brightness objects that were objectively defined as lying more than 1@xmath15 above the ridge - line in the magnitude - surface brightness diagram shown in fig .  1 of @xcite .",
    "this approach is motivated by the fact that more massive galaxies ( @xmath2410@xmath25  m@xmath26 ) generally follow this relation within a 1@xmath15 limit , whereas some low - mass etgs lie well above the relation , a region where tidally - stripped galaxies may reside ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite , as well as @xcite , have suggested that _ most _ low - mass etgs ( i.e. , systems with lower surface brightness than the objects targeted in this study ) are the remains of galaxies that have been strongly transformed by ram - pressure stripping and gravitational harassment after falling into the cluster . @xcite also found that their stellar mass has contracted relative to their progenitors ( assumed to be late - type ) .",
    "therefore , our cfht / gemini survey  which targets some of the most compact ( i.e.  highest surface brightness ) virgo etgs with @xmath27  should provide new insights into the formation of these extreme objects .",
    "we obtained gemini data for eight of the nineteen galaxies that comprised our parent low - mass , compact etg sample in the virgo cluster , with bad weather conditions precluding observations of the remaining galaxies . despite the fact that our actual sample is not complete",
    ", it should nevertheless be representative and allows us to probe a size - mass regime that has not yet been surveyed with the benefit of integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) data .",
    "the galaxies in our sample have surface brightnesses in the range @xmath28  20 mag  arcsec@xmath17 and effective radii of @xmath29 , which corresponds to 165 to 740  pc at their intrinsic distances of , respectively , 16.3  mpc @xcite and 16.7  mpc @xcite .",
    "the properties of our sample galaxies are summarized in table  [ tab : data ] .",
    "although this was not a criterion for the selection , most of our objects are nucleated , or possibly nucleated , galaxies as shown in the acsvcs survey @xcite .",
    "they span a wide range in projected cluster - centric distance , from the center of the cluster close to m87 ( ngc4486 ) , out to virgo s outskirts ( see fig.[fig : virgoloc ] ) .",
    "three of them ( vcc1178 , vcc1192 & vcc1199 ) have projected distances from m49 ( ngc4472 , the brightest galaxy of the virgo cluster ) of less than 50  kpc , while another ( vcc1627 ) is located close to the massive etg m89 ( ngc4552 ) . a fifth galaxy , vcc1297 is a companion of the central massive etg m87 ( ngc4486 ) .",

    "this spectral range provides extensive coverage of strong stellar absorption lines ( e.g. , h@xmath40 , fe and mg@xmath41 triplet ) for measuring the kinematics as well as the population parameters of age and metallicity .",
    "the instrumental spectral resolution is 1688 at 4610  for the grating mentioned above , with an original sampling of 0.5  per pixel .",
    "we binned by a factor two in the spectral direction to get a higher signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) leading to an actual sampling of 1  per pixel and an instrumental spectral dispersion of about 75  @xmath42  ( or a fwhm of @xmath43  at 4610 ) .",
    "typical exposure times for our campaign were @xmath44 seconds and @xmath45 seconds : e.g. ,  2 hours and 3 hours , respectively ( see table  [ tab : dataobs ] ) , to reach a s / n of @xmath46 or better with spatial binning while keeping enough spatial resolution .",
    "one exception is vcc1178 for which an exposure time of @xmath47 seconds was considered sufficient . due to scheduling constraints on the gmos - ifu  configuration ,",

    "however , the blue end of the spectra coming from the left side of the fov can still overlap with the red end of the spectra coming from the right side of the field .",
    "thus , the spectra were shortened by 10% ( @xmath54 ) in the overlapping area to eliminate any contamination from one slit on the other .",
    "we checked the quality of the flat - fielding by applying our procedure on twilight exposures , which should provide a homogeneously illuminated field .",
    "we found a residual uncertainty of about 1% between spectra from the same slit , but a systematic offset of @xmath55  % between the two slits .",
    "this issue is known to arise from errors in the normalization from the gemini iraf flat - fielding recipe itself and not from the data .",
    "we chose not to correct for this offset since our analysis does not require accurate absolute flux calibration , and the spectral shape is not significantly affected . however , the isophotes derived from the integrated flux in the data cubes show some residual asymmetry as a result of this effect ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : maps ] ) , and so should be viewed with caution .",
    "we derived the wavelength solution based on the gcal arc lamp exposures using the task _ gswavelength _ with a 4th - order chebyshev polynomial .",
    "due to charge transfer efficiency issues that can systematically affect the relative centroid of strong and weak lines , as well as introduce effects related to the read - out direction of the detector , we fitted only the 20 brightest lines available in the cuar arc lamps .",
    "we carefully checked that those lines sample the whole wavelength range appropriately .",
    "unfortunately , no bright lines are available redwards of 5187  when using a central wavelength of 4800   which reduced the accuracy of our wavelength solution beyond that wavelength for that configuration .",
    "we therefore excluded the wavelength range @xmath56@xmath39  for the kinematic analysis .",
    "unfortunately , the mg@xmath41 triplet lines were consequently excluded from the fit for the majority of our galaxy sample , but the s / n of our spectra is sufficiently high to still allow us to reach the low velocity dispersion levels required ( see  [ sec : binning ] and fig .  [",
    "fig : mcsim ] for details ) .",
    "we obtained typical formal rms errors in the wavelength calibration of @xmath57  and @xmath58  for the 4800   and 4850   central wavelengths settings , respectively .",
    "finally , we ran the task _ gscrrej _ on each exposure to reject cosmic rays and cleaned the remaining bright cosmic impacts via another cosmic ray rejection algorithm implemented within xsauron . the sky contribution in the science spectra",
    "was subtracted by running the task _ gfskysub _ using the median of all dedicated sky fibers .",

    "we used the software xsauron to reconstruct the final cubes starting from the individual reduced exposures described in  [ sec : datareduc ] .",
    "all individual exposures were first truncated to a common wavelength range ( @xmath48@xmath60 ) and spatially aligned using isophote contours .",
    "the exposures were then merged by interpolating each one onto a common @xmath61 grid , and then taking the optimally weighted sum of the exposures at each pixel .",
    "to increase the s / n of our data , we used the adaptive spatial binning software developed by @xcite , based on a voronoi tessellation .",
    "the formal error spectra are not fully propagated through the reduction process by the gemini iraf package .",
    "therefore , as a first approximation , we assumed that the noise in a given spaxel was directly proportional to the square root of its integrated flux ( i.e. poissonian ) .",
    "we performed a spectral fit of the central unbinned spectrum ( see  [ sec : kinextraction ] for a description of the spectral fitting method used ) to get a good estimate of the noise from the fit residuals , which we used to renormalize our poissonian noise estimate before applying the voronoi binning .",

    "more interestingly , they are faster rotators than the three remaining objects and are also the most compact objects of our sample . while these results may appear in contradiction with the trend suggested by @xcite  that , on average , @xmath169 normalized by @xmath170 ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is lower at small distances from m87  their trend seem weaker , or even absent ( see their figure  5 ) , for galaxies with disk - like structures .",
    "three of the five compact galaxies may have such disk features , suggested by their disky isophotes , so it may not be surprising if they do not participate in such a trend .",
    "observations of larger galaxy samples are definitively needed to confirm , or not , these possible trends .",
    "we now analyze the age and metallicity of the stellar populations in our target galaxies , as tracers of their formation and assembly history .",
    "because the ssp - equivalent ages and metallicities were derived from the stacked spectra , they reflect the single stellar population that dominates the light within the central regions , i.e  @xmath79 or @xmath80 ( see table  [ tab : dataresults ] ) .",
    "no trend is found between the stellar population parameters and the location of our targets within the cluster ( the local galaxy density ) or their @xmath85 parameter .",

    "[ sec : galdensity ] , the galaxies in our sample are more compact than those examined in other studies of low - mass etgs .",
    "thus , we investigated the potential link between their compactness and their stellar population age and metallicity as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sizemass ] . here",
    "we present the gmos - ifu  sample in terms of their ssp - equivalent age and metallicity distributions in the mass - size diagram . to compare our sample to more extended low - mass etgs",
    ", we have added the objects from @xcite , shown as triangles .",
    "no clear trend appears between the age and the location of the objects in the mass - size plane although , on average , the compact etgs are older than less compact systems ( panel _ a _ of fig .",
    "[ fig : sizemass ] ) .",
    "a possible trend is visible between the metallicity and the compactness of low - mass etgs ( panel _ b _ of fig .",
    "[ fig : sizemass ] ) : e.g. , more compact objects tend to be more metal - rich . in the context of low - mass etgs being formed through stripping and harassment , @xcite , showed that these objects become more compact than their progenitors , which are often assumed to be late - type , low - mass spiral galaxies .",
    "the gmos - ifu  sample includes more compact objects than those in @xcite and @xcite , so we would expect our objects to have been further processed .",
    "our findings of older and more metal - rich stellar populations in the most compact etgs is fully consistent with this picture .    in the broader context of galaxy formation",
    ", there exists a longstanding debate on whether low- and high - mass etgs show a dichotomy in their properties , i.e. , whether they represent two distinct populations ( as first advocated by @xcite ) , or whether they form a more continuous sequence in terms of their structure , kinematics and stellar populations .",
    "most recent studies of photometric scaling relations and isophotal parameters suggest a continuity between the low- and high - mass regimes @xcite , but an alternative view is favoured by @xcite .",
    "recent surveys , especially those using ifu spectroscopy , have characterized the detailed kinematics and stellar population properties of more massive etgs . using them as a reference sample ,",
    "we have combined the 260 massive etgs ( @xmath145@xmath3  @xmath171  @xmath3 ) from atlas@xmath4   @xcite , with the 39 low - mass etgs from @xcite and our eight compact low - mass etgs .",
    "we focus here on the ssp - equivalent stellar population information ( e.g.  age and metallicity ) as projected onto the mass - size diagram ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sizemassa3d ] ) . as in fig .",
    "[ fig : sizemassdensity ] , we smoothed the raw data ( panels _ a _ and _ b _ of fig .",
    "[ fig : sizemassa3d ] ) using the loess method with a regularization factor of 0.3 to reveal the first order relationship in the three - dimensional space ( panels _ c _ and _ d _ of fig .",
    "[ fig : sizemassa3d ] ) .",
    "the first striking result from this figure is that there is a level of continuity in age and metallicity for etgs between @xmath144  @xmath3 and @xmath172  @xmath3 .",
    "as observed in @xcite , at fixed size , more massive galaxies are older ; alternatively , at fixed mass , larger galaxies are younger . in term of metallicity , low - mass etgs that are more compact are also more metal - rich , and",
    "more massive galaxies in general tend to have more metal - rich stellar population @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the ages and metallicities of the most compact , low - mass etgs are more representative of more massive etgs , rather than of less compact galaxies with comparable mass .",
    "this similarity between compact low - mass and massive etgs has already been observed , in term of metallicity only , by @xcite for a sample of 21 compact ellipticals in the local group .",
    "this is in agreement with @xcite who showed that the stellar population parameters of massive etgs in the mass - size plane roughly follow lines of iso - velocity dispersion  ( see also @xcite ) , as indicated by the light - blue dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : sizemassa3d ] .",
    "in fact , we find that this result can be extended to low - mass etgs as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : sizemassa3d ] ( albeit with a large scatter in the age distribution ) , with the transition between low- and high - mass etgs being smooth .",
    "taken at face value , this naively suggests that low - mass etgs ( @xmath173  @xmath3 ) may have been shaped by the same secular and/or environmental mechanisms as their massive counterparts ( @xmath2  @xmath3 ) . however , it does not necessarily imply that galaxies evolve along iso - velocity dispersion lines , neither constant metallicity lines .",
    "only detailed simulations focused on stellar population and kinematic parameters would give us clues about the evolutionary track in each scenario ( e.g. tidal stripping , ram pressure stripping , harassment , etc . ) .",
    "[ fig : sizemassa3d ] mostly confirms that velocity dispersion is a good predictor of the age and metallicity of galaxies @xcite , even for low - mass etgs .    finally , if we consider the two - dimensional , mass - weighted age and metallicity maps for our objects ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : maps ] and   [ sec : stellarpop ] ) , we see that nearly half our program objects contain a younger and more metal - rich stellar population in their cores .",
    "this result is in agreement with what has been previously observed in  dwarf \" galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as in many more massive etgs by @xcite .",
    "this finding adds further support to the notion of a continuity among low - mass and high - mass etgs .      over the past decade , many studies have argued for a scenario in which the low - mass (  dwarf \" ) etgs in clusters originated from late - type , star - forming galaxies that were transformed by the cluster environment @xcite .",
    "two main mechanisms are usually invoked to transform the infalling objects .",
    "first , ram - pressure stripping removes gas in about 100200  myr and rapidly quenches the star formation on a time - scale of @xmath174  gyr @xcite .",
    "second , gravitational tidal harassment dynamically heats the low - mass etg progenitors , lowering their angular momentum and concentrating the stellar component ( leading to more compact systems ; @xcite ) .",
    "a third process is certainly also at play : starvation @xcite , which is a form of gas stripping but acts on a much longer time scale ( @xmath1755  gyr ) as shown by @xcite ( see their fig .  4 ) , and affects more efficiently the gaseous halo rather than the inner regions .",
    "this process tends to significantly decrease the surface brightness of the affected object but keeps its characteristic size rather unchanged , in contrast with the effect of ram - pressure stripping  ( see fig .  3 of *",
    "starvation is therefore not able to solely explain the properties of low - mass etgs , especially for the more compact ones .",
    "however it certainly helps stopping their star formation , especially in clusters where a high rate of interactions can easily remove the gas  @xcite .",
    "the exact nature of the progenitors is still a matter of debate .",
    "@xcite , based on a comparison between virgo observations and millenium ii simulations , pointed out that late - type galaxies in the local universe may not be representative of the progenitors of today s low - mass etgs .",
    "they computed the time spent by a low - mass etg inside a high - mass ( @xmath176  @xmath3 ) halo , as well as the mass - loss since first entering the halo ( see their fig .",
    "according to their analysis , and using the galaxy density parameter @xmath177 derived from the ngvs ( see   [ sec : galdensity ] ) , our sample galaxies would have spent , on average , @xmath62 7  gyr inside a halo more massive than @xmath172  @xmath3 .",
    "since our objects have a median age of 9  gyr , this suggests that they have spent most of their lives inside a massive halo , experiencing a variety of environmental effects ( i.e.  from close pair to group interactions ) that would certainly have helped shape their present day structure .",
    "because the scatter in these correlations is quite large , it is hardly surprising for some galaxies to undergo infall at later times and/or experience quite different interaction histories .",
    "this stochasticity could explain the diversity in kinematics and stellar populations observed in low - mass etgs , as well as the highly compact nature of some ( rare ) objects in dense regions .",
    "the galaxies in our sample have @xmath85 values that are lower than more massive galaxies but consistent with  typical \" values found for low - mass etgs . gravitational harassment (",
    "including tidal stripping ) could explain such a decrease in angular momentum and one might naively expect that the longer a given galaxy stays in the cluster , the more angular momentum it looses and the more compact it becomes .",
    "however , our galaxy sample does not show a systematically lower specific angular momentum than less compact , low - mass etgs .",
    "this may suggest either that their compactness is not related solely to gravitational harassment , or that this process ( especially tidal stripping ) can sometimes raise the stellar angular momentum of the system .",
    "several of our program galaxies harbor younger and more metal - rich stellar populations in their center compared to their outskirts .",
    "this is consistent with what one would expect from ram - pressure stripping , where the pressure of the intra - cluster medium can remove gas from a galaxy but its efficiency depends on the relative strength of the gravitational potential of the object .",
    "the gas is thus more easily removed from the outskirts of a galaxy than from its center where it can stay bound to its host and continue forming stars ( see * ? ? ? * in the case of a late - type galaxy ) .",
    "gravitational tidal forces could also be responsible for younger stellar populations in the centers of low - mass etgs as it promotes the formation of bars @xcite that are known to induce gas infall .",
    "others scenarios could potentially explain these observations , though : simple secular evolution , external accretion of gas , i.e.  from the intergalactic medium or from a gas - rich companion ( interaction , merger ) . the latter is more likely to occur in small groups , before a galaxy enters the dense regions of the present - day cluster where the relative velocities are high .",
    "the existence of @xmath157 galaxies in the low - mass etgs population may also provide some constraints pertaining to their formation and evolution .",
    "the counter - rotating disk in vcc1475 , as revealed by our two - dimensional spectroscopy , appears as a rather thin , central structure .",
    "n - body simulations predict that @xmath34% of the dwarfs in virgo could exhibit counter rotation due to harassment @xcite .",
    "however , the formation of such a counter - rotating structure via this process would make the outer part of the galaxy ( @xmath178 ) counter rotating , and this is not what is observed for vcc1475 .",
    "a pure stellar merger event is also unlikely in this case as the inner disk is more metal - rich than the surrounding stellar component .",
    "a gas - accretion event is a more promising hypothesis , probably the result of an interaction with a gas - rich galaxy ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for more details about kdc formation scenarios in cluster environments ) .",
    "the exact origin of this @xmath95 galaxy is unclear but its appearance in a low - mass etg sample certainly adds a level of complexity to the stripping and harassment scenario , emphasizing the importance of the pre - cluster environmental history of cluster galaxies .    in summary , we have shown that the properties of the stellar populations in low - mass etgs show a level of continuity with more massive etgs drawn from the atlas@xmath4  survey ( which itself is representative of the local volume within 40  mpc ) .",
    "the age and metallicity follow the lines of iso - velocity dispersion ( with a large scatter ) suggesting that the formation and evolution processes that makes low - mass etgs ( whether compact or not ) are not very different from the ones acting on high - mass etgs , or at least that their impact vary smoothly with the mass , size and environment of the galaxy .",
    "we have presented and analyzed spectroscopic observations for eight low - mass compact etgs in the virgo cluster using the gmos - ifu  instrument mounted on the gemini north 8-m telescope .",
    "these objects were selected from @xcite and our own next generation virgo survey ( ngvs ; * ? ? ? * ) to probe a regime of etg size and surface brightness that has largely been unexplored with ifu instruments .",
    "our goal has been to characterize their basic kinematics and stellar populations in order to examine possible connections between this rare class of galaxy with more massive ( @xmath2  @xmath3 ) and less compact low - mass etgs .",
    "we performed kinematics and stellar populations analysis using full spectral fitting .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows :    * we calculated the dynamical mass inside one effective radius for each of our objects and confirmed that these galaxies are more compact than most etgs of comparable mass @xcite .",
    "the sample galaxies span a dynamical mass range of @xmath179 to @xmath94@xmath3 and have effective radii of @xmath180 to @xmath181  pc . using the parameters @xmath182 and @xmath149 as proxies of the local galaxy density , we have found that the most compact low - mass etgs are preferentially found in high density regions and often close to a very massive galaxy . * the two - dimensional maps of stellar radial velocity , _ v _ , and velocity dispersion , _",
    "@xmath15 _ , of our objects show a large variety of kinematic structures : from non - rotating systems to those with well organized and high rotation , as well as velocity dispersion profiles that vary from flat to centrally peaked .",
    "our data also provide unambiguous evidence for the @xmath95 nature of the low - mass galaxy vcc1475 . in most cases , low - mass compact etgs with organized and high radial stellar velocity exhibit disky isophotes as revealed by the analysis of the ngvs deep images .",
    "* we assessed the rotational support in these galaxies by calculating their specific apparent angular momentum , @xmath183 , finding two slow - rotators and six fast - rotators .",
    "our sample galaxies have @xmath183 values similar to those found previously in more extended low - mass etgs @xcite and none of them reach values higher than 0.4 as is sometimes observed in more massive galaxies @xcite .",
    "they are generally round objects and we do not find very flattened galaxies ( @xmath184  0.4 ) .",
    "three of the five most compact low - mass etgs have disky isophotes , and all of them are fast rotators with the highest specific angular momentum of our sample . * we found that our program galaxies contain old stars , between 6 and 11.5  gyr , with metallicity between @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
    "half of our sample galaxies contain younger and more metal - rich stellar populations in their centers .",
    "interestingly , low - mass compact etgs with underlying disky isophotes are found to have the oldest stellar populations among our sample .",
    "* we derived ssp equivalent ages and metallicities within @xmath100/2 for our program galaxies , finding a striking continuity between the low - mass and high - mass etgs @xcite .",
    "the more compact galaxies , at a fixed mass , are found to have more metal - rich and older ( albeit with a larger scatter ) stellar populations .",
    "we also extended the results from @xcite to low - mass etgs , showing that the velocity dispersion is a relatively good predictor of the stellar population properties .",
    "our results are consistent with a scenario in which low - mass , compact etgs have spent a large fraction of their lives in the cluster environment and have been strongly shaped by environmental mechanisms such as ram - pressure stripping , tidal stripping , starvation and gravitational harassment .",
    "this picture is quantitatively supported by a comparison of our data to the study of @xcite , who jointly analyzed millenium ii simulations and virgo galaxy observations .",
    "our study underscores the importance of environmental history for low - mass etgs , such as close - pairs , groups , etc . before the pre - present day cluster epoch .",
    "perhaps most significantly , our study adds to a growing body of evidence that a continuity exists in the structural , kinematic and stellar population properties of low- and high - mass etgs , which in turn suggests that etg formation and evolution processes vary smoothly with mass , size and environment across the full range in galaxy mass .",
