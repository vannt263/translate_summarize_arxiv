    "discussions of dark matter and dark energy have led to the hypothesis that einstein s gravitational theory does not hold on very large scales .",
    "an example of such a modification is the replacement of the ricci scalar @xmath1 by @xmath0 in the einstein - hilbert action to yield @xmath2 apart from the gravitational effects , no direct evidence of dark matter has ever been found .",
    "that dark matter is a geometric effect of @xmath0 gravity has already been shown by b@xmath3hmer , harko , and lobo @xcite .",
    "all that is required is a small change in the ricci scalar .",
    "the purpose of this note is to present a simple alternative argument based on a slight modification of @xmath0 gravity as defined by kuhfittig @xcite .",
    "an important objective in any modified gravitational theory is to explain the peculiar behavior of galactic rotation curves without postulating the existence of dark matter : test particles move with constant tangential velocity @xmath4 in a circular path .",
    "it is noted in ref .",
    "@xcite that galactic rotation curves generally show much more complicated dynamics . for present purposes , however , the analysis can be restricted to the region in which the velocity is indeed constant . in this note",
    "we will go a step further and confine the analysis to a narrow band around a constant @xmath5 , the size of which is to be specified later .",
    "a constant radius is of particular interest since for the motion of particles in circular orbits , the potential @xmath6 must satisfy certain conditions if the orbit is to be stable .    to meet the limited goals in this note ,",
    "we need only a few basic facts about galactic rotation curves @xcite .",
    "we start with the line element @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "( we are using units in which @xmath10 . )",
    "according to ref .",
    "@xcite , for a test particle with four - velocity @xmath11 we have @xmath12 where @xmath13 and the potential is @xmath14 moreover , if the circular orbits are given by @xmath5 , then @xmath15 also , two conserved quantities , the angular momentum @xmath16 and the relativistic energy @xmath17 , are given by @xcite @xmath18 and @xmath19 the orbits are stable if @xmath20",
    "as noted earlier , the radius @xmath5 will be specified later . for",
    "now it is sufficient to recall that we will stay in a narrow band around @xmath5 .",
    "the importance of this assumption lies in the fact that , due to its simple form , @xmath21 , so we may assume that @xmath22 .",
    "( by contrast , the behavior of @xmath23 is much more volatile in the present situation , as we will see . )",
    "the assumption @xmath22 allows us to define the concept of  slightly modified gravity , \" as discussed by kuhfittig @xcite .",
    "to that end , we list the gravitational field equations in the form used by lobo and oliveira @xcite : @xmath24 @xmath25,\\ ] ] @xmath26+\\frac{f(r)}{2r^3}[b(r)-rb'(r)],\\ ] ] where @xmath27 .",
    "the curvature scalar is given by @xmath28 observe that eqs .",
    "( [ e : einstein1])-([e : einstein3 ] ) reduce to the einstein field equations for @xmath22 whenever @xmath29 . so comparing eqs .",
    "( [ e : einstein1 ] ) and ( [ e : scalar ] ) , a slight change in @xmath30 results in a slight change in @xmath1 . according to eq .",
    "( [ e : f(r ) ] ) , this characterizes @xmath0 modified gravity .",
    "this change can be quantified by assuming that @xmath31 remains close to unity and relatively flat , i.e. , @xmath32 is relatively close to zero .",
    "our first step is to expand @xmath31 in a taylor series around @xmath5 : @xmath33 since @xmath34 is assumed to be close to @xmath5 , higher - order terms become negligible .",
    "so @xmath35 and @xmath36 , while @xmath37 .",
    "observe that @xmath38 can be omitted .",
    "even though @xmath5 has not been specified , we can assume that @xmath39 and @xmath40 can be treated as parameters in eqs .",
    "( [ e : einstein1])-([e : einstein3 ] ) since the precise values are not needed .",
    "next , we take the equation of state to be @xmath41 describing normal matter and also implying that @xmath42 , since a cosmological setting assumes a homogeneous distribution of matter .",
    "it now follows from eqs .",
    "( [ e : einstein1 ] ) and ( [ e : einstein2 ] ) that @xmath43 after some rearrangement , we get @xmath44 integrating , we have ( since @xmath30 and @xmath45 are assumed to be constants ) @xmath46 or @xmath47 thus @xmath48    before returning to the stability question , we need to show that thanks to the properties of @xmath31 , @xmath49 .",
    "first recall that @xmath50 is close to zero for any @xmath51 .",
    "so @xmath52 in eq . (",
    "[ e : shape2 ] ) could get large beyond any bound as @xmath53 .",
    "( at this point , @xmath5 is still unspecified . )",
    "we conclude that in order to get a meaningful result , @xmath54 has to be less than unity whenever @xmath55 , thereby causing @xmath56 to become negligible for @xmath40 sufficiently close to zero . since @xmath34 is assumed to be close to @xmath51 , by letting @xmath57 , we get the following approximate inequality : @xmath58 or @xmath59 solving , @xmath60 which is the approximate range of @xmath51 for the case @xmath55 . for example , if @xmath61 and @xmath62 , then @xmath63 .",
    "the interval widens to a large region as @xmath64 gets closer to 1/2 .",
    "if @xmath65 , then we must have @xmath66 leading to @xmath67 where the left inequality is disregarded since @xmath51 is positive .",
    "we now see that the previously unspecified radius @xmath51 actually satisfies the approximate inequalities ( [ e : case1 ] ) and ( [ e : case2 ] ) , as a result of which @xmath68 .",
    "( we will also use these inequalities in the next section to show that we do not obtain any stable orbits in einstein gravity . )    returning now to eq .",
    "( [ e : v1 ] ) , we can write @xmath69\\ ] ] and define @xmath70 observe that @xmath71 and @xmath72\\right|_{r = a}=0.\\ ] ] continuing with these calculations , we find that @xmath73 so @xmath74 in the neighborhood of @xmath5 .",
    "[ see fig . 1 .",
    "]     near @xmath5.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    we now have @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "since @xmath77 and @xmath78 are constants , it follows directly from eq .",
    "( [ e : v2 ] ) that @xmath79 thereby showing that we have stable orbits .",
    "in this section we examine the limiting case @xmath80 , corresponding to einstein gravity .",
    "suppose in the equation of state @xmath81 we have @xmath82",
    ". then inequality ( [ e : case1 ] ) yields @xmath83 but the same relationship is obtained from inequality ( [ e : case2 ] ) whenever @xmath84 .",
    "now , as we get close to einstein gravity , @xmath40 gets close to zero regardless of the value of @xmath51 .",
    "so in either case , @xmath85 as @xmath86 and we do not get a ( finite ) stable orbit in einstein gravity .    .",
    "this note gives a simple argument showing that stable galactic orbits are an effect of @xmath0 gravity without dark matter by assuming a particular definition of slightly modified gravity @xcite : the function @xmath31 in the einstein field equations is characterized by the properties @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "given the equation of state @xmath81 , @xmath89 , describing normal matter , we obtain stable circular orbits , namely @xmath5 , satisfying the following approximate inequalities : if @xmath55 , then @xmath90 if @xmath65 , then @xmath91 these inequalities indicate that such stable orbits exist in a large region .",
