    "in general , diffusion of the relativized versions of ideas born in condensed matter and solid state physics to the quantum field theory has been proven to be extremely fruitful .",
    "it was realised long time ago that a complex of problems associated with investigation of the qcd vacuum structure appeared as particularly suitable object in this respect .",
    "this paper is focused on the further development of approach to qcd vacuum as a medium describable in terms of statistical ensemble of domain wall networks .",
    "this concept plays important role in description of condensed matter systems with rival order and disorder but has been insufficiently explored in application to qcd vacuum .",
    "the identification of the properties of nonperturbative gauge field configurations relevant to a coherent resolution of confinement , chiral symmetry breaking , @xmath2 and strong cp problems is an overall task pursued by most approaches to the qcd vacuum structure .    as a rule ,",
    "analytical as well as lattice qcd studies of qcd vacuum structure are focused on localized topological configurations ( instantons , monopoles and dyons , vortices ) which _ via _ condensation could be seen as appropriate gauge field configurations responsible for confinement of static color charges and other nonperturbative features of strong interactions . in recent years , three - dimensional configurations akin to domain walls became popular as well @xcite .",
    "first of all , these are the @xmath3 domain walls related to the center symmetry of the pure yang - mills theory  @xcite and double - layer domain wall structures in topological charge density  @xcite .",
    "lattice qcd serves as a main source of motivation and verification tool for these studies in pair with the theoretically appealing scenario of static quark confinement in the spirit of the dual meissner effect equipped with the wilson and polyakov loop criteria .",
    "the localized configurations are characterized by the vanishing ratio of the action to the 4-volume in the infinite volume limit . in this sense ,",
    "instantons , monopoles , vortices and double - layer domain walls are localized configurations .",
    "a complementary treatment of the above mentioned overall task is based on the investigation of the properties of quantum effective action of qcd . as in other quantum systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom ,",
    "the global minima of the effective action define the phase structure of qcd .",
    "the identification of global minima in different regimes ( high energy density , high baryon density , strong external electromagnetic fields ) has highest priority for understanding the phase transformations in hadronic matter . in general , a nontrivial global minimum corresponds to a gauge field with the strength not vanishing at space - time infinity and , hence , extensive action proportional to the four dimensional space - time volume of the system , unlike the localized configurations .",
    "a variety of essentially equivalent statements of the problem in the context of qcd can be found , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "global minima related by discrete symmetry transformations like cp , weyl symmetry in the root space of @xmath4 , center symmetry in particular , is a reason to look for field configurations interpolating between them .",
    "first of all , these are domain wall configurations , but also lower dimensional topological defects .",
    "there is among others one difference between this treatment and approaches based on localized objects : the last one intends to merge the initially isolated objects ( e.g. , instanton gas or liquid ) while the former collects defects in an initially homogeneous background . at first sight , both ways seem to lead to a similar outcome - a class of nonperturbative gluon field configurations with a self - consistent balance of order and disorder which can be characterized , in particular , by nonzero gluon condensate and topological charge density .",
    "however , essential disparity can arise since a superposition of localized objects inherits the properties of isolated objects while the superposition of defects in the initially homogeneous ordered background brings some disorder and merely refines the overall properties of the background .",
    "for instance , the superposition of infinitely many instantons and anti - instantons is not a configuration with a finite classical action but it maintains the property to have integer - valued topological charge . on the contrary ,",
    "the configuration obtained by implanting infinitely many domain wall defects into the abelian covariantly constant ( anti-)self - dual field can have any real value of the mean topological charge density as well as any real value of topological charge fraction per domain  @xcite . both configurations can be seen as lumps of the topological charge density distributed in the euclidean space - time like in fig.[fig : kink_network ] or in the lattice configurations  @xcite .",
    "however , in the instanton picture each lump carries an integer charge while in the treatment of global minima the charge is any real , irrational , for instance , number .",
    "this can have dramatic consequences for the fate of @xmath5 parameter in qcd and the natural resolution of the strong cp - problem  @xcite .    in the euclidean formulation ,",
    "the statement of the problem starts with the very basic symbol of the functional integral @xmath6\\ } ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the functional space @xmath7 is subject to the condition @xmath8 the constant @xmath9 is not equal to zero in the general case , which is equivalent to nonzero gluon condensate @xmath10 .",
    "condition ( [ cond0 ] ) singles out fields @xmath11 with the strength which is constant almost everywhere in @xmath12 .",
    "it is a necessary requirement to allow gluon condensate to be nonzero .",
    "it does not forbid also fields with a finite action since the case @xmath13 has to be also studied .",
    "the dynamics chooses the value of @xmath9 .",
    "however , the phenomenology of strong interactions has already required nonzero gluon and quark condensates .",
    "hence , they must be allowed in the qcd functional integral from the very beginning .",
    "separation of the long range modes @xmath11 responsible for gluon condensate and the local fluctuations @xmath14 in the background @xmath11 , must be supplemented by the gauge fixing condition . the background gauge condition for fluctuations",
    "@xmath15 is the most natural choice .",
    "further steps include integration over the fluctuation fields resulting in the effective action for the long - range fields and identification of the minima of this effective action ( for more details see @xcite ) which dominate over the integral in the limit @xmath16 and define the phase structure of the system .",
    "as soon as minima are identified , this setup defines a principal scheme for self - consistent identification of the class of gauge fields which almost everywhere coincide with the global minima of the quantum effective action . a treatment of these `` vacuum fields '' in the functional integral @xmath17",
    "\\\\   & & \\times\\delta[d(b)q ] \\exp\\{-s[b+q]+s[b]\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] must be nonperturbative . the fields @xmath18 are subject to condition ( [ cond0 ] ) with the fixed vacuum value of the condensate @xmath19 .",
    "the condensate plays the role of the scale parameter of qcd to be identified from the hadron phenomenology .",
    "the fluctuations @xmath20 in the background of the vacuum fields can be seen as perturbations .",
    "the homogeneous fields with the domain wall defects are the most natural and simplest example of gluon configurations which are homogeneous almost everywhere in @xmath12 and satisfy the basic condition eq.([cond0 ] ) .",
    "basic argumentation in favour of the abelian ( anti-)self - dual homogeneous fields as global minima of the effective action originates from papers @xcite .    within the ginzburg - landau approach to the effective action the domain wall",
    "is described simply by the sine - gordon kink for the angle between chromomagnetic and chromoelectric components of the gluon field  @xcite .",
    "this kink configuration can be seen as either bloch or nel domain wall separating the regions with self - dual and anti - self - dual abelian gauge fields . on the domain wall",
    "the gluon field is abelian with orthogonal to each other chromomagnetic and chromoelectric fields .",
    "we shall not repeat here arguments leading to this conclusion but just refer to papers  @xcite where a more detailed discussion can be found .",
    "group theoretical analysis of the weyl symmetry and subgroup embeddings behind the domain wall formation in the effective gauge theories is given in a recent paper  @xcite .",
    "it should be also mentioned that the model of confinement , chiral symmetry breaking and hadronization based on the dominance of the gluon fields which are ( anti-)self - dual abelian almost everywhere demonstrated high phenomenological performance  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to evolve the approach outlined in article  @xcite in two respects : explicit analytical construction of the domain wall network in @xmath12 through a combination of additive and multiplicative superpositions of kinks , and refining the spectrum and eigenmodes of the color charged scalar , spinor and vector fields in the background of a domain wall .",
    "in particular the spectrum of quasiparticles inside the thick domain wall junction is evaluated .",
    "it is shown that the standard methods of the sine - gordon model  @xcite allow one to generate various domain wall networks .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are found for the laplace operator in the background of a single infinitely thin domain wall . in this case , the eigenvalue problem has to be solved separately in the bulk of @xmath12 and on the 3-dimensional hyperplane of the wall .",
    "the continuity of the charge current through the wall is required together with the square integrability of the bulk eigenfunctions . for the infinitely thin wall the bulk eigenfunction possesses the purely discrete spectrum which coincides with the spectrum for the case of a homogeneous ( anti-)self - dual field without a kink defect .",
    "the eigenfunctions differ in a certain way but have the same harmonic oscillator type as the ones in the absence of the kink defect .",
    "these modes describe confined color charged fields .",
    "the eigenfunctions localized on the wall have continuous spectrum with the dispersion relation of charged quasi - particles .",
    "this confirms qualitative conjectures of @xcite .",
    "it is argued that thick domain wall junction may be formed during heavy ion collisions and play the role of a trap for charged quasi - particles .",
    "confinement is lost inside the trap of a finite size .",
    "there exists a critical size of the stable trap , beyond which the emerging tachyonic gluon modes destroy it .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  ii is devoted to the domain wall network construction .",
    "the spectrum of scalar color charged field in the background of infinitely thin domain wall is discussed in section  iii . in the fourth section",
    "we discuss the chromomagnetic trap formation and evaluate the spectrum and eigenmodes of the color charged scalar , vector and spinor quasiparticles inside the trap .",
    "the calculation of the effective quantum action for the abelian ( anti-)self - dual homogeneous gluon field within the functional renormalization group approach  @xcite has indicated that this configuration is a serious candidate for the role of global minimum of qcd effective action and has enhanced the older one - loop results @xcite .",
    "the functional rg result also supported conclusions of  @xcite based on the ginzburg - landau type effective lagrangian of the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a scale of qcd related to gluon condensate , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 detailed discussion of this expression can be found in @xcite . here it should be noted that all symmetries of qcd are respected and the signs of the constants are chosen so that the action is bounded from below and its minimum corresponds to the fields with nonzero strength , i.e. @xmath25 at the minimum .",
    "thus , an important input is the existence of the nonzero gluon condensate . by inspection",
    ", one gets as an output twelve ( for @xmath26 ) global degenerate discrete minima .",

    "the minima are connected by the discrete parity and weyl transformations , which indicates that the system is prone to existence of solitons ( in real space - time ) and kink configurations ( in euclidean space ) .",
    "below we shall concentrate on the simplest configuration  kink interpolating between self - dual and anti - self - dual abelian vacua . if the angle @xmath32 between chromoelectric and chromomagnetic fields is allowed to deviate from the constant vacuum value and all other parameters are fixed to the vacuum values",
