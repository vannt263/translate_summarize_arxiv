    "one of the major puzzles in modern cosmology is to unveil the physical mechanism responsible for the late - time cosmic acceleration .",
    "the two main approaches considered in the literature are the following : ( 1 ) the existence of an unknown component with negative pressure , generically denominated dark energy , whose equation - of - state parameter ( @xmath3 ) satisfies @xmath4 , and ( 2 ) general relativity ( gr ) has to be modified at large scales or , more accurately , at low curvatures ( modified gravity ) .",
    "the simplest dark - energy candidate is the cosmological constant ( @xmath5 ) that , as it is well known , faces some theoretical difficulties ( such as its tiny value when comparing the theoretical expectation to the vacuum energy density , the so - called cosmic coincidence and its fine - tuning ) , but it is in very good accordance with current cosmological observations .",
    "the simplest modified - gravity candidate is the so - called @xmath0 gravity in which the lagrangian density @xmath6 is a nonlinear function of the ricci scalar @xmath1 .",
    "an accelerated expansion appears naturally in @xmath0 theories .",
    "indeed , the very first inflationary model , proposed more than 30 years ago @xcite , is curvature driven by a term proportional to the square of the ricci scalar @xmath1 [ @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) ] and , interestingly enough , it is still in excellent accordance with current observations @xcite .",
    "more recently the same idea has been explored in refs . @xcite and @xcite , but in the low - curvature regime .",
    "they considered a late - time acceleration driven by an inverse power law , @xmath9 ( @xmath8 and @xmath10 ) .",
    "however , those models have a serious drawback : they do not present a regular matter - dominated phase .",
    "the scale factor of the friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric , @xmath11 , grows with cosmic time , @xmath12 , as @xmath13 ( instead of the standard @xmath14 ) and , therefore , those models are incompatible with structure formation @xcite .",
    "there are viable @xmath0 gravity theories that do not present the above mentioned problem and satisfy both local gravity and cosmological constraints @xcite .",
    "these models suffer , however , another difficulty : the curvature singularity in cosmic evolution at a finite redshift @xcite .",
    "indeed , this seems to be a generic feature of all the so - called `` viable '' @xmath0 theories @xcite , including the new one proposed in the present paper .",
    "however , this singularity problem can be cured , for instance , by adding to the density lagrangian a high curvature term proportional to @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "therefore , it appears that it is not possible to have cosmic acceleration with a totally consistent @xmath0 theory modifying gravity _ only _ at low curvatures . in this work",
    "we are not addressing this issue and we will be concerned only with @xmath0 modifications at low curvatures .",
    "another feature of all viable @xmath0 theories discussed so far in the literature is that structure formation imposes such strong constraints on their parameters that their cosmic expansion history , in practice , can not be discriminated from that of cold dark matter with a cosmological constant ( @xmath5cdm ) . in this work",
    "we propose a class of @xmath0 theories that may change this characteristic .",
    "the proposed modification depends on a parameter that controls the steepness of @xmath0 allowing measurable ( in the near future ) deviations from @xmath5cdm at both perturbation and background levels ( @xmath16 ) , while still compatible with both current observations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ model ] , we introduce the model , obtain its field equations , investigate its background expansion history and examine the behavior of the effective equation of state parameter as a function of the parameters of the model and redshift . in sec .",
    "[ local ] , we discuss the constraints on the model from local gravity tests and growth of structure .",
    "our conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "in this work we investigate gravity theories described by the following action @xmath18 ,   \\label{acao }      \\vspace{-0.1cm}\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is an arbitrary function of the ricci scalar @xmath1 .",

    ". it is straightforward to verify that ( [ fr ] ) generalizes several interesting cases .",
    "for instance , if @xmath25 we obtain exponential gravity @xcite@xcite @xmath26 while for @xmath27 we get @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the error function .",

    "therefore , if @xmath36 the steepness is larger than in the exponential case which implies that , cosmologically , when we go back in time from the present ( increasing @xmath1 ) , the @xmath5cdm regime is achieved faster .",
