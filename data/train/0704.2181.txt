    "quantum systems when placed in low dimensional lattices typically exhibit strongly correlated effects driving them towards regimes with no classical analog .",
    "many properties of these regimes or quantum phases @xcite depend in turn on the properties of their ground state and low lying energy excitations @xcite .",
    "a problem of particular interest in the field of strongly correlated systems is the emergence of critical phases in a system where the generic behaviour as coupling constants are varied is to be a gapped system , although those gapped phases may be of different nature . in this paper",
    "we address this problem by selecting a system of quantum spins that allows us to perform a detailed study of critical and non - critical phases on equal footing , i.e. , without any bias towards an a priori preferred phase . for reasons explained in sect.[sect_model ] ,",
    "the quantum spins are arranged in a 2-leg ladder lattice @xcite with anti - ferromagnetic heisenberg couplings along the legs while rung couplings are ferromagnetic .",
    "in addition , we also introduce an explicit dimerization coupling in the hamiltonian along the leg directions , which can be varied from zero to strong values .",
    "this coupling plays a major role in order to create the aforementioned critical phases out of a system with only gapped phases .",
    "this particular type of 2-leg ladder system has a number of open problems such as the precise location of critical phases in the phase diagram of the coupling constants , and the nature of the gapped phases it exhibits .",
    "our study is complete enough so as to be able to solve for these problems in a very precise manner .",
    "the understanding of these purely quantum effects is usually a hard problem .",
    "perturbative and variational methods in quasi - one dimensional systems like chains and ladders are not well suited to uncover the physics in the whole range of coupling constants involved in the description of the interactions in the system . on the contrary",
    "the dmrg method @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite allows us to identify the critical phases clearly and without any bias .",
    "this is so because the method is non - perturbative and allows a controllable management of errors .",
    "our studies are also of interest since experiments on ladder materials have revealed a very complex behaviour , such as an interplay between a spin - gapped normal states and superconductivity @xcite . moreover , a new field of study for these complex effects has been opened by the simulation of strongly correlated systems in optical lattices @xcite , in particular quantum spin chains and ladders @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sect.[sect_model ] we introduce the model hamiltonian describing a 2-leg ladder lattice of spins @xmath3 with columnar bond - alternating antiferromagnetic couplings in the horizontal direction and ferromagnetic couplings in the vertical direction , see fig.[ladderpic ] .",
    "we can identify some particular behaviours in appropriate weak and strong coupling limits , but not for generic values of the couplings .",
    "in sect.[sect_critical ] we point out the rich physical effects posed by open boundary conditions in these 2-leg ladders with finite length , although it also implies an a priori analysis in order to find out which low - lying states contribute to the gap of the system in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this we can be done with the dmrg method by targeting several states and measuring their magnetization properties in the bulk and at the ends .",
    "then , we compute numerically the gap and we establish the existence of a critical line in the quantum phase diagram of the model",
    ". a numerical fit of this critical curve is also given . in sect.[sect_haldanedimer ] we determine the structure of the phase diagram by identifying the type of gapped phases occurring at each side of the critical line found in the previous section .",
    "they correspond to haldane and dimer phases .",
    "they are identified by measuring the string order parameter and the dimerization parameter with the dmrg method .",

    "competing ferromagnetic versus antiferromagnetic spin interactions may give rise to critical phases if they are appropriately arranged in certain quasi - one dimensional lattices .",
    "one emblematic example of this phenomenon is a lattice of quantum spins with the shape of a 2-leg ladder such that there are antiferromagnetic couplings along the legs and ferromagnetic interactions along the rungs connecting both legs .",
    "in addition , the antiferromagnetic couplings are bond - alternating in a columnar fashion .",
    "dimerization interactions in the hamiltonian are also known as staggered interactions .",
    "this configuration is shown in fig.[ladderpic ] .",
    "more precisely , this configuration of heisenberg - like interactions is associated with the following quantum hamiltonian    . in the horizontal direction ( legs )",
    ", we picture the bond alternation with strong links @xmath4 and weak links @xmath5 . in the vertical direction ( rungs ) , the system is arranged in the form of a columnar dimerization : strong links are parallel to one another , and similarly for weak links in the lattice . ]",

    "notice that several known regimes can be reached by tuning the coupling constants towards particular values . in the weak coupling limit , making @xmath13 we end up with a system consisting on two effectively decoupled @xmath14 heisenberg chains with bond alternation ( bahc ) , which are known to be gapped for every value of the dimerization parameter @xmath15 @xcite , except for the point @xmath16 . in the strong coupling limit , making @xmath17 the system can be effectively described by a @xmath18 spin chain with bond alternation , which is predicted to be gapped for all values of @xmath15 except for a critical point at a non - zero value @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "these predictions are based on an approximate mapping onto the o(3 ) @xmath20 model @xcite at topological angle @xmath21 .",
    "this yields a critical value of @xmath22 when @xmath23 , and similarly another symmetric critical value at @xmath24 .",

    "prediction misses the correct location of the critical point due to the approximations involved in that mapping .",
    "the exact location of this point has been widely studied @xcite and results slightly varied depending on the approach , however modern studies place it at @xmath27 @xcite@xcite , also compatible with fig.[l500vsl2x140](_lower _ ) which gives @xmath28 for a chain of @xmath29 sites .",

    "we shall provide ways to do this identification by targeting appropriate low - lying states and measuring convenient observables with them .    in particular",
    ", using open boundary conditions we have found that the first excited state lies within the sector with total z - spin angular momentum @xmath37 , but in the haldane phase it converges to the ground state that has @xmath59 as we take larger sizes of the system .",

    "the reason for considering @xmath64 instead of @xmath65 as the gap of the system , can be justified as follows : in the complete dimerized limit @xmath66 , it is clear that the difference in energy between two arbitrary consecutive levels is the same , and corresponds exactly to the energy needed to promote one singlet bond to a triplet . the argument for the limit @xmath16 makes use of the properties of haldane phases , where it is known to appear a non bulk excitation due to the existence of virtual spins at the end of the chain .",
    "our conclusion is that the lowest lying state with @xmath67 consists on a superposition of two kind of excitations , namely the haldane non - bulk triplet mentioned before and the bulk itself , also giving a triplet . considering this scheme , in order to obtain the gap related to the bulk excitations we have to substract the non bulk excitations present in the lowest lying states of sectors @xmath68 and @xmath67 .    in fig.[obcexcitations ]",

    "the _ down _ part of this figure , we plot the difference of energy density of the excited states with @xmath37 and @xmath38 : @xmath40 the difference has been divided into three contributions : the contribution labelled with _ even _ stands for links involving sites in the same leg and the even sublattice ( @xmath70 ) , _ odd _ involves links joining sites in the same leg and the odd sublattice ( @xmath71 ) , and _",

    "notice also that the difference of the density of energy between these states is close to zero at the ends , while it becomes clearly apreciable in the bulk .",
    "all these facts strongly support the picture of a non - bulk triplet excitation with the same nature in both states , that leaves the bulk of the chain with a neat value of the projection equal to @xmath76 and @xmath77 and gives a strong hint on the equivalence of @xmath78 with periodic boundary conditions and @xmath64 for open systems .     sites .",

    "since we are explicitly introducing some staggering in the hamiltonian , the dimerization parameter is non - vanishing even in the haldane phase .",

    "the graph corresponding to the @xmath18 bahc , has been scaled down by a factor @xmath89 due to the effective coupling constant of the ladder , which is known to be half the constant corresponding to the bahc . ]",
    "now , we can detect the presence of a critical line in the quantum phase diagram separating gapped phases . in fig.[l500vsl2x140 ] we plot the critical region consisting of the coordinates for each minimum in fig.[gap21 ] . in earlier studies",
    "@xcite , we placed the critical point of the @xmath18 bond - alternating heisenberg chain ( bahc ) at @xmath27 .",
    "the curve shown in fig.[l500vsl2x140 ] shows a vertical asymptota that is still a bit off from this limiting value corresponding to the region @xmath79 , but this is simply because we have chosen a value of @xmath90 which is still not big enough and also due to finite - size effects on the 2-leg ladder . in the lower plots of fig.[l500vsl2x140 ]",
    "we address these possibilities by comparing our ladder in the strong ferromagnetic limit with a pure @xmath18 bahcs with different sizes .",
    "two parameters are important in this discussion , namely , the value @xmath52 that minimizes the gap , and the value of the gap itself at this point @xmath91 .",
    "as we can observe in fig.[gap21 ] , the value of @xmath91 does not strongly depend on the particular choice of the coupling constant ratio @xmath44 , while it is definitely influenced by the size of the system .",
    "in fig.[l500vsl2x140](lower ) it is shown that the shift of @xmath19 computed for two @xmath18 bahcs with different sizes , but still large enough both , is less noticeable than the difference in their value of @xmath91 .",
    "it is clear the similarity of this magnitude in the case of the ladder and the corresponding bahc , as well as the shift in the value of @xmath19 .",
    "all this make us conclude that in order to attain a better convergence with the @xmath18 bahc and a better estimate of the critical asymptota @xmath27 , we shall increase the strength of the ferromagnetic coupling rather than the size of the system .",
    "as we have a set of numerical data from the finite - size analysis of the critical line , we can also make a numerical estimation of the criticality curve . in fig .",
    "[ fit ] we present a fit of the critical curve in the region close to @xmath92 .",
    "we choose as trial function for this fitting an inverse power law with some coefficients and exponents that are fixed by our numerics , namely , @xmath93 the fitting yields the following estimations for the values of the parameters @xmath94 and @xmath95 that best fit the data : @xmath62 and @xmath96 , and for simplicity the value of @xmath27 is taken for fixed .     in the ground state of a @xmath69 sites ladder and @xmath56 .",
    "the plot on the left shows the correlation value for some arbitrary values of @xmath15 .",
    "the plot on the right shows the value of this magnitude in the whole region of the parameter @xmath15 . ]",
    "once we have established the existence of a critical line in the quantum phase diagram of the model , it is natural to wonder about the two gapped phases that this line separates .",
    "more specifically , whether they are different or not and their identification as quantum phases in the framework of strongly correlated systems",
    ".    the possible nature of those phases can be guessed from the strong ferromagnetic limit @xmath97 of the ladder , effectively leading to the @xmath18 bahc .",
    "the phases of this chain are known to be the massive haldane phase , separated by a critical point from the also massive dimer phase . to test the nature of each phase",
    ", we will resort to two different order parameters .",
    "the haldane phase is known to exhibit a particular hidden order that can be measured by the string order parameter ( sop ) @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the definition of this operator for a spin-1 chain is as follows : @xmath98 this operator acting on our ground state measures how far it is from a spin liquid nel state consisting on a sequence of @xmath18 spins such that every spin with projection @xmath99 is followed by @xmath100 and @xmath101 for every @xmath102 .    when we deal with @xmath14 particles , to compute the sop we have to define the pairs of particles which are most likely to couple to give a triplet and compute the sop along the path connecting them .",
    "in our case , the existence of a ferromagnetic coupling clearly suggests that the triplets will result via this coupling .",
    "it is also worth recalling that the sop is a parameter suited to work with translational invariant systems . in order to correctly estimate the sop in open systems",
    ", we must restrict the computation to a region shorter than the whole length of the chain where end - effects are negligible and only bulk physics is relevant . in fig.[sop ] we show the sop computed traversing the path shown in fig.[laddersop ] .",
    "we can observe a non - vanishing sop in the haldane region , while it rapidly decays to zero in the dimer phase .",
    "the inset shows the sop computed for a @xmath18 bahc and the resemblance between both systems is apparent .",
    "therefore , the phase below the critical line in the numerical phase diagram of fig.[l500vsl2x140 ] is a gapped haldane phase .     in the first lying excited state in the sector with @xmath37 of a @xmath69 ladder and @xmath56 . ]     in the first lying excited state in the sector with @xmath38 of a ladder consisting on @xmath88 sites and @xmath56 . ]",
    "as for the region above the critical line in fig.[l500vsl2x140 ] , we have guessed from the strong coupling limit that it may be a dimer phase .",
    "the structure of a dimer phase is such that full translational invariance symmetry of the system is broken by one unit cell of the lattice .",
    "this situation can be detected by means of the dimerization parameter , which can be defined for our particular 2-leg ladder as @xmath103     ladder for the lowest lying states in the sectors @xmath37 ( _ top _ ) , and @xmath38 ( _ bottom _ ) . the curves are separated in the different sublattices consisting on the sites ocuppying odd or even positions .",

    "nevertheless , our plots clearly exhibit different behaviours related to the convexity of the parameter at each phase .",
    "this observation indicates that an accurate estimation of the point of inflexion in the dimerization parameter could be used as a measure of the critical point separating both phases .",
    "we have also performed some measurements in the ladder to give more hints to understand the nature of both phases .",
    "figures [ colormap0 ] , [ colormap1 ] , and [ colormap2 ] show the correlation @xmath106 between sites in the perpendicular rungs .",

    "we observe that the perpendicular rungs in the ground state are forming triplets and the distribution is uniform all along the ladder . in the excited states",
    "however , the triplet strength of some rungs is weakened , signaling the presence of magnon - like excitations , also apparent in fig.[szgraph ] .",
