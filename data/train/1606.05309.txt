    "considerable observational progress is being made in charting when cosmic reionization occurred .",
    "the most recent values of @xmath4 , the optical depth of electron scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons , reported by the planck consortium @xcite , implies the average redshift at which reionization occurred lies between @xmath5 and 8.8 .",
    "this represents a significant revision of the picture inferred from earlier cmb data and indicates reionization was both more rapid and occurred more recently than earlier imagined . combining the cmb data with line of sight measures of the opacity of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) obtained via spectroscopy of high redshift quasars and gamma ray bursts @xcite and the fraction of lyman break galaxies whose ly@xmath2 emission is detectable @xcite , indicates reionization began shortly before @xmath6 and was largely complete by @xmath7 .",
    "late reionization is particularly important in strengthening the view that star - forming galaxies were the primary ionizing agent .",
    "the abundance and luminosity distribution of @xmath8 galaxies is increasingly well - determined from deep imaging in blank and cluster lens fields using hubble space telescope s ( hst ) near - infrared camera wfc3/ir@xcite .",
    "@xcite present a model showing that , depending on their ionizing output , the demographics of the @xmath9 galaxy population can match the planck @xmath10 values by a redshift @xmath6 .",
    "there are two key uncertainties in the ionizing output .",
    "the first is an efficiency factor , @xmath11 , necessary to convert the ( observed ) uv luminosity to the production rate of lyman - continuum photons ; this depends on the nature of the stellar population and the presence or otherwise of agn .",
    "reasonable progress has been made in estimating typical @xmath11 values for high redshift galaxies from recombination or other emission line measures @xcite .",
    "the second uncertainty is the fraction , @xmath12 , of the ionizing photons that escape into the igm due to the porosity of neutral hydrogen in a typical galaxy . for reasonable values of @xmath11 ,",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite require an absolute escape fraction , @xmath13@xmath14see section [ sec : def ] for the definition of @xmath13@xmath14 and @xmath13@xmath15 . ] , of up to 20% to account for the planck value of @xmath10 whereas @xcite and @xcite estimated @xmath13@xmath16 .    the most direct way to measure the escape fraction is to detect the leaking lyman continuum ( lyc ) photons through spectroscopy or appropriate rest - frame imaging . in the local universe , non - zero spectroscopic",
    "lyc measures are only available for six galaxies .",
    "most have @xmath13@xmath17 @xcite , while one has @xmath13@xmath18 @xcite .",
    "several surveys have attempted direct detection at @xmath19 with a similarly low success rate - a few detections out of hundreds examined ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . even when significant detections are apparent , they usually reflect contaminating radiation from foreground galaxies that can easily camouflage as substructures of the clumpy high - redshift galaxies(e.g . * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "so far , only three convincing detections have been reported : @xmath13@xmath20 , @xmath13@xmath21 and @xmath13@xmath22^[note1]^ @xcite . with an assumption of some attenuation",
    ", @xcite translates the measured relative escape fraction to @xmath13@xmath23 .",

    "the relatively rare lyc leakers at @xmath25 tend to be compact , less massive , efficiently star - forming systems with high [ o iii]/[o ii ] emission line ratios @xcite .",
    "@xcite present a model whereby the high [ o iii]/[o ii ] line ratio seen in many intense ly@xmath2 emitters can be understood if the hii regions are density- rather than ionization - bound . in this case , although a rare population locally , if such [ o iii]-intense systems are more common at high redshift(e.g .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , conceivably the mean escape fraction in the reionization era is significant ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "numerical simulations show mixed results regarding escape fraction and its evolution with redshift .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations yield escape fractions ranging from smaller than a few percent ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to @xmath26 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in galaxies with halo masses @xmath27@xmath28 with a strong anti - correlation between escape fraction and halo mass .",
    "@xcite show recently that inclusion of binary star evolution can boost the escape fraction at @xmath29 to be as high as @xmath30 .",
    "most simulations find little or no evolution in the escape fraction but rather a temporary fluctuation with different delay times after bursts of star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "while observational progress will eventually be made in securing robust measures of the escape fractions for large samples at @xmath25 , the above discussion illustrates how evolution in the galaxy population necessitates measures of @xmath12 for sources in the reionization era .",
    "unfortunately , the direct methods discussed above are not practical for galaxies with @xmath31 due to the increased igm absorption .",
    "only a modest amount of foreground neutral hydrogen can completely absorb the lyc radiation .",
    "therefore , even with the full armory of the james webb space telescope ( jwst ) and next generation large ground - based telescopes , indirect methods are the only route to estimating @xmath13  and hence understanding the role of galaxies in this final piece of cosmic history .",
    "@xcite have proposed a method for estimating the lyc leakage using a combination of the uv spectral energy distribution ( which constrains the stellar population ) and the strength of a balmer line such as h@xmath32 through recombination theory . for @xmath9 galaxies ,",
    "this requires spectroscopic access to wavelengths beyond 2 @xmath33 m and thus must await jwst .",
    "a more immediate indirect method is to constrain the _ covering fraction _",
    "@xmath34 of low ionization gas from absorption line spectroscopy .",
    "as discussed in  4 this provides a valuable proxy for the escape fraction .",
    "the technique was first applied locally with promising results .",
    "@xcite studied 26 star - forming galaxies correlating the residual absorption signals they found from low ionization species with fuse spectroscopy below the lyman limit and the strength of recombination lines . in our earlier work",
    "@xcite we first applied the absorption line method to a stacked spectrum derived from 81 @xmath354 lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) .",
    "in comparison with a similar stack at @xmath36 @xcite , the covering fraction was reduced implying an increased porosity of neutral gas and a higher @xmath12 .",
    "a further comprehensive analysis of stacked spectra in the context of the escape fraction for 121 @xmath353 galaxies at @xmath353 has recently been presented by @xcite .    however , our experience with stacked spectra has revealed limitations in their utility for the present purpose . at the spectral resolution available in our large scale redshift survey at @xmath37@xcite ,",
    "the weakened absorption found at @xmath354 - 5 could equally reflect evolution in the outflow kinematics . by its very nature as a composite , the stacked spectrum must average over of a range of absorption line kinematic profiles , confusing any interpretation of the spectra in terms of opacity alone .",
    "clearly it is preferable to study the joint kinematics and absorption line depths in suitably bright individual galaxies .",
    "although a challenging task , in @xcite we secured higher resolution absorption line spectra of 3 _ gravitationally - lensed _",
    "@xmath354 galaxies and , taking into account different kinematic profiles , confirmed the original redshift dependence mentioned in @xcite we also found a lower covering fraction for those galaxies with intense ly@xmath2 emission .",
    "although one expects @xmath38 and thus the method can strictly only provide an upper limit @xcite , our goal here is to enlarge the sample of lensed galaxies , both in size and redshift range , so we can strengthen evidence for an evolutionary trend as well as improve our understanding of the behavior of @xmath12 with other physical properties of high redshift galaxies .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze high signal to noise absorption line spectra for a further 4 lensed high redshift galaxies , more than doubling the sample in @xcite and extending the redshift range to @xmath39 .",
    "this allows us to better examine the evolutionary trend in @xmath34 as well as correlations with other parameters .",
    "moreover , by studying lensed galaxies with strong gravitational magnification , we demonstrate that resolved spectroscopy allows to examine how the covering fraction varies _ across a galaxy _ as a function of its kinematics and spatially - dependent star - formation rate .    a plan of the paper follows .",
    "we present our new data in  2 .",
    "the basic properties of our sample are then determined in  3 , including the lens models essential for recovering the intrinsic star formation rates and luminosities .",
    "we introduce two methods for deriving the escape fractions in  4 and examine the trends derived for the total sample ( including that in @xcite ) with redshift and the ly@xmath2 equivalent width .",
    "we also discuss the spatially - resolved data for the @xmath40 galaxy lensed by the cluster ms1358 + 62 .",
    "we summarize our results in  5 .",
    "for the present study we selected four gravitationally - lensed galaxies from the literature using the following criteria : ( i ) spectroscopic redshift @xmath41 , ( ii ) total apparent magnitude @xmath42 and ( iii ) the availability of a reasonable lens model to enable the magnification to be determined . in conjunction with the earlier study by @xcite ,",

    "this grating choice allow us to sample rest - frame wavelengths from 1200 to 1650   ensuring good coverage of lyman @xmath2  , si@xmath44 , o@xmath45si@xmath46 , c@xmath47 , and si@xmath48 . for multiply - imaged galaxies , where possible we arranged the multi - slits to cover as many images as practical .",
    "the final slit placements are overlaid on hst images of each target in figure [ fig : slit ] .",
    "we reduced the deimos spectra using code associated with the spec2d pipeline . because our galaxies are lensed with extended non - gaussian profiles , we used a boxcar extraction with specified full width half maxima ( fwhm ) to extract the 1d spectra from the 2d data .",
    "each spectrum was corrected for telluric absorption line using spectra of standard stars and smoothed with the spectral resolution at each wavelength measured from atmospheric emission lines . for absorption line measurements ,",
    "we spline fitted the continuum and normallized each spectrum . if the galaxy was observed with multiple masks ( in the case of ms1358 ) or had multiple images ( macs0940 ) , we combined the continuum - normallized 1d - spectra using a weighted arithmetic mean . for ms1358 , we excluded arc b in the final combination both to prevent contamination from a foreground lensing galaxy and since some sub - components in the lensed image lay outside the slit . for star formation rate measurements , we calibrated each telluric - corrected spectrum using standard stars observed at the end of each night for an overall throughput correction and flux calibrated using hst photometry in that imaging band which overlaps our deimos wavelength coverage .",

    "the goal of this paper is to interpret the covering fraction of low ionization gas in terms of new constraints on the escape fraction of ionizing photons in an enlarged sample of @xmath0 galaxies .",
    "we will introduce two methods for making the connection between the covering and escape fraction . however , first it is important to introduce some definitions .",
    "the most important measure of the escape fraction is that used in calculating whether galaxies are capable of driving cosmic reionization .",
    "this is the _ absolute escape fraction _ defined as :    @xmath123    that is the ratio between the lyman continuum flux density escaping the galaxy , usually measured at 900 , to the internal stellar flux density at the same wavelength .",
    "most of the escape fractions reported in numerical simulations and theoretical calculations refer to this absolute value . however , observationally it is very difficult to estimate the internal stellar flux density at 900  since it requires modeling the spectral energy distribution(sed ) beyond the range of direct observation . instead ,",
    "a more accessible estimate is the _ relative escape fraction _ defined as :    @xmath124    since @xmath125 can be additionally absorbed by neutral hydrogen in the igm along the line of sight , we can write @xmath126 as a function of the observed lyman continuum flux(@xmath127 ) as    @xmath128    notwithstanding the fact that the relative escape fraction can be obtained from good observations , modeling of the seds is still required to determine the intrinsic ratio of the 900   and 1500  luminosities , which results in additional uncertainties .",
    "we can estimate the covering fraction of neutral hydrogen in a galaxy by measuring the amount of non - ionizing uv radiation absorbed by metals following the approach described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "realistically , we must assume that galaxies are covered partially by hi regions with different velocities relative to the systemic value .",
    "neutral clouds of a particular velocity will have a covering fraction of @xmath129@xmath130 .",
    "photons of each low - ionization absorption line , when shifted to match the cloud velocity , will be able to escape if they travel through holes in the neutral gas or will otherwise be attenuated .",
    "the underlying principle is that low ionization gas represents a faithful tracer of neutral hydrogen , an assumption discussed in detail by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite find low ionization absorption line widths correlate with the inferred escape of lyman @xmath2 photons , and @xcite find a strong correlation with 21 cm line widths which directly trace the neutral hydrogen .",
    "however , @xcite claim , from their recent @xmath353 sample , that the outflowing gas may be metal poor in which case the true hi covering fraction could be underestimated somewhat by our technique .",
    "the relevant radiative transfer equation is : @xmath131    where @xmath132 is the continuum level and @xmath10 is the optical depth of each absorption line : @xmath133 where @xmath134 is an oscillator strength of each transition from level @xmath135 to @xmath136 ( available from the nist atomic spectra databased ) , @xmath137 is the transition wavelength in , and @xmath138 is the ion column density in @xmath139(km s@xmath140 .",

    "if we have more than two absorption lines originating from the same ion , we can solve for the two variables .",
    "this picture of a `` picket fence '' for the ism , whereby each individual absorbing cloud forms a ` picket ' for each velocity bin , is consistent with that determined to be an appropriate model for local analogs of high redshift star - forming galaxies .",
    "a good example follows observations of the cah and k absorption lines in clouds around hot ob stars that resolve into several radial velocity components @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite found all four local lyman break analogs with high residual intensities in the low - ionization absorption lines are a better match to the picket fence model compared to a uniform shell model .",

    "an exception is made is when the lines are optically thick , in which case only a lower limit on the column density can be obtained .",

    "the covering fractions estimated from low - ionization absorption profiles at each velocity resolution element are shown in figure  [ fig : covfrac ] .",
    "in general we find that the absorbing gas is spatially inhomogeneous : the absorption line profiles show only partial covering of the stellar radiation with a maximum absorption depth of @xmath14950100% . formally this translates to geometric escape fractions of up to 50% .",
    "only two of the seven lensed galaxies , a2219 and j1621 , are consistent with a complete ( 100% ) covering fraction at any velocity and hence a zero escape fraction . without accounting for possible spatial variations in the covering fraction as a function of velocity , which will be examined in section [ sec : spatial_variation ] , we find a median value of covering fraction in our enlarged sample is @xmath150 .",
    "if this represents the true hi covering fraction , corresponds to @xmath151 .",
    "however , to translate these measures to the desired absolute escape fractions , it is necessary to account for dust extinction since these galaxies are not dust - free as indicated by the fact their uv slopes @xmath152 ( see table  [ table : sfr ] ) . accounting for reddening based on the dust - in - cloud model ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the corresponding median @xmath153 and weighted standard deviation of our sample becomes @xmath154% . at face value such an absolute escape fraction , if typical of sources at higher redshift , would imply that early star - forming galaxies are readily capable of maintaining reionization(e.g .",
    "our median value derived from low - ionization absorption profiles is consistent though somewhat larger than that inferred via recombination rate studies of the igm using qso absorption lines at a similar redshift , which imply @xmath155 @xcite . if @xmath12 is indeed 12% then we would expect an average @xmath156% for our sample , accounting for reddening .",
    "it is likely that our estimate is higher than the true value due to several violations of the assumed simple `` picket fence '' model of absorption as discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we now explore these possibilities quantitatively in order to estimate the degree by which our @xmath157 measures may overestimate the true escape fraction .",
    "firstly , it is possible that the non - ionizing stellar radiation could be associated with a lower covering fraction of gas than that for the ionizing starlight .",
    "this would arise if , for example , the h i and low - energy ions preferentially cover younger stars . one way to estimate",
    "the potential importance of this effect is to estimate the fraction of detected uv continuum radiation ( at @xmath1491500  ) which arises from starlight whose photons are incapable of ionizing hydrogen . for a galaxy with a history of continuous star formation",
    "over 100 myr , only around 10% of the uv radiation arises from spectral types later than b @xcite so this can not be a significant effect .",
    "furthermore the si ii transitions show no evidence of a higher covering fraction at shorter wavelengths .",
    "such an effect would result in weaker absorption of si ii @xmath1371526   compared to @xmath1371304   in an optically thick gas , which is not observed in the majority of our combined sample where both lines are free from sky contamination .",
    "we therefore conclude that a differential covering fraction of ionizing stars introduces @xmath158% systematic error on our derived values .",
    "a second uncertainty arises from the fact that scattered photons are capable of `` filling in '' the absorption profiles , mimicking a reduced covering fraction . in the extreme case where line filling is induced from optically thin gas ,",
    "the si ii 1304 and 1526   absorption profiles would be filled by  50% of the flux seen in the si ii * 1309 and 1533 lines , respectively .",
    "the observed fine structure emission line fluxes therefore allow us to directly estimate the magnitude of this effect . in abell 2219 where these emission lines are strongest",
    ", we find that scattering could only reduce the inferred covering fractions by at most 13% . on average across the full sample ,",
    "we find line filling can change our derived @xmath157 by at most 4% ( i.e. to @xmath159% ) which is small compared to the quoted uncertainties .",
    "the actual effect of line filling must be even less than this limit as most cases indicate optically thick absorption .    in summary ,",
    "accounting for the possibilities of wavelength - dependent covering fraction and line filling discussed above , we can revise the original covering fraction to at most @xmath160% implying @xmath161% . however , we emphasize that these corrections represent the maximum conservative limits allowed by our data , and there is no conclusive evidence that the effects discussed actually reduce @xmath12 at all . therefore the difference between our covering fraction measurement and the @xmath162% implied by igm studies , if real , can only be reconciled if these are the only important effects .",
    "the most challenging and remaining uncertainty arises from the possibility that absorbing gas at different velocities may cover different spatial lines of sight ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to examine this possibility",
    ", we would need to examine the _ spatial variation _ of the absorption line profiles .",
    "normally this would currently be impractical in any source at @xmath163 but , by good fortune , this is possible in our most distant lensed source ms1358 . in the next section ,",
    "we show that it is likely that such spatial variations may be the largest cause of difference between our derived covering fractions and the true ionizing escape fraction .          in the specific case of the highly - magnified target ms1358 at @xmath164 , we can examine the covering fraction of low ionization gas in discrete sub - components of the galaxy .",
    "when the region being examined spectroscopically is physically small , the angular distribution of clouds of different velocities should be less of a concern .",
    "in addition , if a particular region has a high star - formation rate , the possibility that its stellar continuum is affected by non - ionizing radiation should also be reduced . by examining the spectroscopic variation among the star - forming clumps in ms1358",
    ", we can therefore address several of the uncertainties in the inferred escape fraction from our methods discussed above .    adopting the lensing magnification from our ltm model (  3.3 ) and physical parameters for ms1358 calculated in @xcite ,",
    "its total stellar mass is @xmath165@xmath28 and its integrated star - formation rate(sfr ) is @xmath166@xmath28 yr@xmath43 . the source itself is only a few kpc@xmath167 in size . since the individual clumps are conveniently linearly distributed along the arc , we have extracted spectra of each of 3 regions for specific clumps identified by @xcite . due to the limited spatial resolution of our ground - based spectroscopy and the signal to noise of our data , we group 3 of the smaller clumps ( c1 - 3 ) together in extracting the spectra .",
    "the resulting arrangement targeting 3 regions ( c0 , c1 - 3 and c4 ) is shown in figure [ fig : clump ] alongside the [ oii ] image derived from the @xcite integral field unit observations .",
    "importantly , we find there is a significant variation in the low - ionization absorption profiles across the source ( figure [ fig : covfrac_clumps ] ) .",
    "the inferred covering fraction ranges from near - complete ( @xmath168 ) in c0 to only @xmath169 in c4 .",
    "the variation within ms1358 is comparable to that across the integrated analysis of our full sample shown in figure [ fig : covfrac ] .",
    "as expected , it suggests that the escape fraction is governed by small - scale physics associated with star - forming regions .",
    "the variation between individual clumps indicates that covering fractions derived from integrated spectra may not be representative of the sum of all regions , and we can examine the degree of this effect .",
    "the sfr - weighted total of individual clumps is @xmath170 whereas we find @xmath171 based on the integrated light ( figure 7 ) .",
    "it is possible that even higher covering fractions would be found at finer spatial resolution , although we note that @xcite found @xmath172 in a compact source of similar size to the clumps studied here ( @xmath149 few hundred pc ) .",
    "we conclude that spatial variation in the covering fraction therefore reduces the limit on @xmath12 by a factor of @xmath173 in this source . to help determine the extent to which this source is representative of the larger sample , in the following sections we examine trends in our sample as a function both local and integrated physical properties .    .",

    "they propose this correlation , modeled according to contributions from both photoelectric absorption and dust extinction , could form the basis of a new method to infer the escape fraction of high redshift galaxies , thereby bypassing the assumption of our method that the opacity of low ionization metal lines represent a reasonable proxy for that of neutral hydrogen .",
    "although a correlation between the line of sight extinction , as inferred from the color excess @xmath177 , and @xmath34 seems reasonable , for the integrated spectra for our full sample , we nonetheless found no strong dependence between our absolute covering fraction and @xmath177 .",
    "however , the three data points from the resolved data on ms1358 suggest that regions with higher covering fractions within the galaxy have redder uv continua and also stronger star formation rates as shown in table [ table : sfr ]",
    ". we will explore the variation of absorption line strength and star formation rates in the next section .",
    "our spatially - resolved observations of ms1358 presented in  4.5 suggested that the implied escape fraction of ionizing photons depends sensitively on the small - scale structure of its star - forming regions .",
    "here we consider the origin of these variations in terms of both the local and integrated star - formation rates .",
    "the star formation rate ( sfr ) may have two opposing effects on the escape fraction .",
    "first , the sfr is directly correlated with the column density of gas , including lyc - absorbing hi as well as molecular h@xmath178 and dust @xcite however , strong feedback and radiation pressure in high sfr regions may clear the absorbing clouds resulting in a higher escape fraction . understanding the balance between these two effects in early galaxies is critical in resolving the question of whether galaxies are capable of maintaining an ionized igm .    according to our data shown in figure [ fig : sfr_fc ] ,",
    "we see tentative evidence of a modest anti - correlation between sfr and the inferred escape fraction .",
    "formally this trend is non - zero at the 2.8@xmath179 level , with a correlation coefficient of @xmath180 for the galaxy - integrated measurements .",
    "the trend is apparently stronger ( though statistically consistent ) for the individual clumps in ms1358 as compared to that seen for the integrated values across the galaxies in the sample .",
    "if real , this difference might be expected since the escape fraction inferred for an entire galaxy is necessarily a spectroscopic measure averaged over clumps with a range of both low and high sfrs .",
    "the observed anti - correlation can be interpreted in two independent ways .",
    "firstly , regions of low sfr are associated with lower column densities of both interstellar and outflowing material ( including hi and dust ) .",
    "therefore , the probability of holes permitting leaking lyc photons is higher .",
    "alternatively , regions with lower sfr may represent those whose rates were higher in the past and are now in decline .",
    "the associated delay time increases the chance that feedback effects can clear any covering clouds .",
    "although both explanations may be valid , we consider the latter more likely because only a small column density of hi gas is needed to extinguish any leaking lyc radiation .",
    "regardless of the surface density of low ionization gas , it seems feedback will be the more effective factor in governing both a low sfr and a smaller hi covering fraction .",
    "most radiative transfer hydrodynamical simulations of the resolved ism support our conjecture that a time delay will increase the escape fraction .",
    "star formation may become increasingly ` burst - like ' at high redshift@xcite and the escape fraction will then fluctuate on short time scales , out of phase with the sfr .",
    "@xcite find a delay of @xmath310 myr for a covering cloud to be dispersed by feedback from supernovae , while @xcite found a slightly shorter delay of @xmath33 - 10 myr . a larger delay will increase the strength of the anti - correlation between sfr and escape fraction .    one cautionary remark is relevant in considering how to interpret figure [ fig : sfr_fc ] given the sfr values are inferred from gravitationally - lensed galaxies using our lensing model (  3.3 ) .",
    "while the intrinsic sfr can be reliably estimated by dividing the observed value by the appropriate magnification , the covering fraction is measured from the absorption line depths in the image plane .",
    "hence , there is a potential bias such that the covering fraction so measured will refer to that of the regions with the highest magnifications . it would only be possible to appropriately transfer the absorption line spectra into the source plane with resolved spectroscopy using an integral field unit spectrograph . such a bias would , however , only be significant if there is a significant magnification gradient along an arc , e.g .. when it is close to a critical curve . in our sample , this issue is not important .",
    "both a1689 and a2219 have low and uniform magnifications and the individual ms1358 clumps are sufficiently small as to have uniform magnifications within each region . when ms1358 is considered as an entirety , we excluded arc b ( figure [ fig : slit ] ) which has a high variation in magnification",
    ". macs0940 is the only system where the variation in magnification is significant .",
    "however , its sfr is relatively low so such a bias is unlikely to affect its location on the relation in figure [ fig : sfr_fc ] .    ) .",
    "the trend is apparently stronger in individual star - forming clumps.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      it is clear that , despite the significant uncertainties , our moderate covering fractions imply absolute escape fractions that are higher than the averages observed via direct measures of the lyc radiation at lower redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if star formation is increasingly burst - like at high redshift where galaxies are physically more compact , it is quite likely from the arguments discussed above , that there is increase in @xmath13  with redshift .",
    "theoretical studies present conflicting predictions on the question of evolution in @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite present an analytical calculation that illustrates why the average escape fraction should decrease with time during the reionization era . with an assumed value for the efficiency of star - formation , they estimate @xmath13  decreased by a factor of 3 from @xmath181 to @xmath182",
    ". however , sample - limited radiative hydrodynamical simulations show no significant variation over the same redshift interval @xcite .    in compiling the data for figure [ fig : z_fc ] we include observations at redshifts @xmath183 from @xcite ( not shown in table 1 ) , @xcite , and @xcite . across this increased redshift range",
    ", the figure shows that we can not yet detect any significant time dependence .",
    "this is because the scatter in covering fraction is dominant and apparently constant over time , in agreement with our deduction that the escape fraction depends largely on the small - scale structure of clouds , their physical association with star formation regions and the short timescale of activity , and consistent with the behavior of simulated galaxies in @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : z_fc ] , absorption line measurements of comparable quality to those presented here are still scarce at @xmath184 - 3 .",
    "recent studies of the  cosmic horseshoe \" at @xmath185 further highlights the challenge in comparing direct and indirect methods .",
    "the covering fraction was found to be @xmath75% using methods equivalent to ours @xcite , yet imaging below the lyman limit indicates @xmath186 @xcite .",
    "this might be reconciled if @xmath34 overestimates @xmath12 by a factor of 5 , or by low igm transmission ( @xmath14920% probability , @xcite , or a combination of both effects .",
    "at present the cause is not clear and it will be of great interest to examine low - ion covering fractions in more low redshift sources with direct @xmath12 measurements .",
    "this is becoming feasible following recent lyc detections in nearby galaxies using hst / cos ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite present new measures of the covering fraction of both the low ionization gas and neutral hydrogen for stacked spectra derived from their keck survey at @xmath353 providing a valuable complementary approach to that discussed here .",
    "although we have highlighted the possible difficulties of inferring a mean covering fraction from a stack of many spectra with diverse kinematic absorption line profiles ( such as the variety shown in figure 4 ) , @xcite draw from a much larger sample and have questioned some of the assumptions inherent in the use of low ionization gas alone . however , within the observational uncertainties at this stage , both approaches give reasonably consistent results for the inferred escape fraction at @xmath41 .    despite significant observational and theoretical effort , direct evidence for a rising escape fraction at high redshift is still lacking due to the scarcity of lyc detections . our data set suggests a median @xmath187% at @xmath188 - 5 if we interpret the covering fraction as @xmath189 . however , spatial variation may lower this value to @xmath190% if the resolved properties of ms1358 are typical of our sample , and other effects discussed in section 4.4 may reduce the value slightly further ( to @xmath191% ) .",
    "these estimates are certainly compatible with independent determinations from the igm , as well as an increase over the limits at @xmath192 .",
    "furthermore the demographic trends in figures 7 and 8 indicate that we may expect escape fractions to increase with redshift , commensurate with increasing @xmath193 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we speculate that a key difference may be that star formation is more burst - like ( e.g. higher specific sfr ; @xcite at higher @xmath194 .",
    "intense short - duration starburst episodes may be capable of clearing sightlines through the local ism resulting in increased ionizing escape during periods of lower activity , giving rise to the trend in figure 8 .    .",
    "no trend is apparent and the scatter supports our deduction that the escape fraction is governed by the small scale behavior of star - forming regions which fluctuate in their activities over short timescales .",
    "the color scheme follows that in figure [ fig : sfr_fc ] . the black error bar and the black data point show @xmath157 derived from low - ionization absorption profiles , in a stacked spectrum of @xmath195 galaxies from @xcite and in a spectrum of a lensed @xmath196 galaxy from @xcite respectively.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "we present intermediate resolution absorption line spectroscopy for four new gravitationally - lensed sources which , together with our earlier work @xcite , provides a total sample of seven star - forming galaxies in the redshift interval @xmath0 .",
    "our signal to noise in all cases is adequate to sample the depth of absorption in low ionization species which can act as a valuable indicator of the covering fraction of neutral hydrogen .",
    "we describe two methods to convert this covering fraction into estimates of the fraction of lyman continuum photons that are capable of reaching the intergalactic medium and undertake a critical analysis of possible uncertainties in our results .",
    "our enlarged sample strengthens the trends discovered in our earlier work .",
    "in particular we find :    * the amount of absorbing gas varies significantly from galaxy to galaxy across our sample .",
    "however , only two systems are consistent with a complete coverage of low ionization gas .",
    "the median observed covering fraction is 66% . following a correction for reddening based on a dust - in - cloud model , we infer a median absolute escape fraction of lyman continuum photons of @xmath154% * we discuss various uncertainties in this estimate including the possibility that the stellar radiation has different covering fractions depending on its ionizing capability as well as scattered photons which could fill in the absorption line profiles mimicking a reduced covering fraction .",
    "we demonstrate that , even in the extreme case , these issues would only lower the escape fraction to no less than 11% , a value in broad agreement with independent estimates based on recombination studies of the igm probed by qso absorption lines . further study of low - ion absorption lines in nearby galaxies with recent lyc detections will help determine the degree to which covering fractions may overestimate @xmath12 . * for one of our lensed sources , ms1358 ,",
    "we demonstrate that the low ionization gas is clearly spatially inhomogeneous with covering fractions ranging from 40 - 100% across various star - forming clumps .",
    "although our sample generally strengthens the correlation we found earlier whereby the escape fraction increases with the equivalent width of ly@xmath2 emission , the scatter increases when we consider trends in the individual star - forming clumps in ms1358 , consistent with recent numerical simulations . as the escape fraction is anti - correlated with the local star formation rate , this suggests a time delay between a burst and the emergence of leaking lyman continuum photons . *",
    "overall , our observations indicate significant variations in the escape fraction , both from galaxy - to - galaxy and spatially within an individual galaxy .",
    "this pattern is consistent with the ability of escape being governed by the small scale behavior of star - forming regions which fluctuate in their activities over short timescales .",
