    "the interstellar extinction down to the lyman limit is of interest for several reasons .",
    "shortward of 1200 , the extinction rises strongly and differences between galaxy environments appear to increase .",
    "this means that corrections to observed ( uv restframe ) fluxes are potentially very sensitive to the amount and type of interstellar extinction .",
    "this is important in understanding the energy budget of galaxies with young stellar populations , and at high redshifts in identifying the full population of young galaxies .",
    "there have been many studies in the iue / hst range ( 1200 - 3200 ) where it is known that the extinction curve varies widely between different environments ( see e.g. cardelli , clayton , and mathis 1989 : ccm ; gordon and clayton 1998 ) .",
    "in particular , the uv extinction laws differ stongly between the galaxy , lmc , and smc , in the sense that lower abundance galaxies have higher uv extinction for a given visible reddening , and less pronounced 2175   ` bump ' .",
    "this general rule is thought to indicate that the ism composition or range of grain sizes changes with continued stellar enrichment .",
    "there are , however , variations within the local galaxies that must reflect a range of local ism conditions or history .",
    "it is more difficult to obtain reddening for the much fainter stars in the m31 group galaxies , but work by bianchi et al ( 1996 ) shows that the variations are seen there too .    in the range below 1200 , observations are rare and the rising extinction makes it difficult to get data on significantly reddened stars .",
    "the hut spectrograph on astro yielded extinction curves in this range , but for only 2 stars ( clayton et al 1996 ) .",
    "fuse is more powerful , has higher resolution , and is building up an archive of spectra suitable for this work . while there are programs planned to observe reddened stars specifically for extinction studies , we present in this paper an initial , but significant derivation of extinction from lightly reddened stars observed for other purposes .",
    "this study describes some of the difficulties in deriving extinction curves in this wavelength range , and presents some results from the galaxy and magellanic clouds , where the expected extinction differences are seen and measured .",
    "the sample of stars was chosen to contain pairs matched in spectral type and luminosity with different b - v , assumed to indicate a different amount of extinction .",
    "table 1 shows the stars selected from the fuse pi team database of ob stars taken for stellar wind and o vi studies .",
    "these stars were selected for their spectral class and uv flux , and thus are not highly reddened , except for the galactic stars , where brighter stars are available .",
    "all observations were taken with the large fuse aperture and the data were processed uniformly with the calfuse data pipeline .",
    "the data were not obtained through the fuse archive as most were still proprietary , so the data used may possibly differ from that which were delivered to the archive .",
    "since the magellanic cloud stars are lightly reddened , the precision of the colour photometry is an important part of the error budget of this work .",
    "we have used what we regard as the most reliable values from the literature in table 1 , but in all cases we investigated the effects of photometric errors within the range ( typically a few hundredths of a magnitude ) of values published for the individual stars , or other stars from the same papers .",
    "we also rely on spectral types to pick good pairs of stars to compare for differential reddening , and a similar inspection of published spectral types was made .",
    "the adopted spectral types are given in table 1 .",
    "as the fuse archive grows , more and better pairs will become available , so this list represents only those that were suitable after the first year of operations .",
    "the fuse spectra were edited of airglow emission lines , where significant ( see feldman et al 2001 ) , before further processing . using model spectra of h@xmath0 absorption ( tumlinson , private communication ) ,",
    "the strongest features were edited out by placing a continuum across them .",
    "these absorptions are signifcant at the shorter wavelengths ( below 1100 ) , and usually in stars with e@xmath1=0.2 or more .",
    "see hutchings et al ( 2001 ) for an illustration of the h@xmath0 spectrum .",
    "strong wind lines , present in high luminosity o stars , were identified from the atlas of ob fuse spectra which the fuse team is preparing ( or as illustrated by fullerton et al 2000 ) , and also edited out .",
    "the edited spectra were then ratioed with the less reddened star as numerator , and the result was heavily smoothed ( 5   or more boxcar ) .",
    "this was done separately for all channels of fuse data , so that each pair of stars yielded a set of 8 ratioed spectra .",
    "these were then plotted in inverse wavelength , normalised to unit e@xmath1 , as is conventional for extinction plots .",
    "this approach usually resulted in 8 non - continuous lines , although all showed the expected rise with decreasing wavelength .",
    "the discontinuities arise from the h@xmath0 blanketing , which changes strongly with wavelength , flux errors at the edges of channels , fuse detector ` worm ' effect , and possibly extraction incompleteness .",
    "the small differences of reddening between the stars in our pairs means that these are amplified by large factors ( typically 30 ) in normalising to unit e@xmath1 .",
    "nevertheless , the average of each emsemble of 8 plots appeared to represent credible extinction curves for the fuse range .    in order to treat each spectrum more uniformly across the whole fuse range ,",
    "the spectra were edited of airglow and then all channels resampled to 1a bins and overplotted .",
    "h@xmath0 models were generated with the same sampling and plotted for a range of absorbing columns .",
    "some stars have had detailed h@xmath0 modelling by tumlinson et al ( 2001 ) .",
    "this process allowed us to a ) identify a smooth mean observed spectrum over the whole fuse range , and b ) estimate the continuum level of the star by correlating the strengths of the main h@xmath0 absorption features , and interpolating across any strong wind lines .    in this way , each spectrum was modelled as a continuum defined by 12 points across the full fuse wavelength range , and these were then divided and normalised .",
    "the results were generally consistent with the separate channel plots , but without the discontinuities .",
    "the absolute level of the extinction was derived by correcting the numerator spectrum by a factor which amounts to the ratio of unreddened v - band flux , taking into account the observed v magnitudes and b - v colours .",
    "this is standard practice and treats the numerator star as having total extinction equal to the difference of extinction between the two stars .",
    "the results for the sample stars are shown in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "because of the large multiplier applied for small extinction differences , we repeated the processing for a set of v and b - v values for the stars covering the range of published values , or their errors . figures 1 and 2",
    "illustrate these , and show the sensitivity of the derived extinction curves to these quantities .",
    "the figures plot the overall continuum 12-point ` models ' .",
    "the results from the individual channel plots are illustrated for the nominal photometric values by the pairs of filled squares .",
    "these show the end points of linear fits to the ensembles of 8 individual channel plots .",
    "the agreement between these and the plotted continuum models gives a good idea of the reproducibility of our analysis by two different approaches .",
    "the individual extinction curves in figures 1 - 2 were assessed for their sensitivity to the uncertainties in continuum fitting , and to the photometric values as described above .",
    "there is clearly a wide range of curves present , and some are very dependent on the photometric precision .",
    "figure 3 shows our adopted mean curves for the three galaxies , derived from the individual ranges of extinction curves in figures 1 and 2 , weighted by the colour difference for each pair .",
    "these mean curves were calculated for 5 wavelength bins .",
    "the plots also show schematic longer wavelength extinction curves for the galaxy , lmc , and smc , that represent those found in the literature . in figure 3",
    "we indicate the full range of curves for the lmc and smc from misselt et al ( 1999 ) and gordon and clayton ( 1999 ) , while for simplicity the smaller diagrams just show ` typical ' curves for each galaxy .",
    "the curves in figure 3 have ` formal ' errors per point which are about the separation between the three curves . however , the fact that the curves are nearly parallel and do not cross , add significance to the overall family of curves and their trend with host galaxy abundances .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear from figures 1 and 2 that more reliable results will require stars with more extinction , more detailed continuum modelling , and more precise photometry .",
    "clayton et al ( 1996 ) published extinction curves for two lmc stars in this range from hut spectra .",
    "these are more heavily reddened than ours , and their extinction curves closely bracket our mean galactic curve , while lying above the ccm sketched model .",
    "however , the general steepening rise is reproduced very closely .",
    "extinction from galactic star pairs as indicated .",
    "schematic extinction curves for smc , lmc , and ccm are shown in each panel for comparison .",
    "the nominal values of @xmath2 are labelled , and the other values are given to show the sensitivity of the extinction curve to the photometric precision .",
    "in the case of the b0.5 pair , we also show the effect of a change of v magnitude with the same colour difference .",
    "the black squares show the end values for the extinction derived from the separate chennel plots ( see text for description ) .",
    "the agreement between the squares and the nominal colour difference plots is an indication of the random errors in continuum fitting .",
    "mean values from star pairs in the three host galaxies , from figures 1 and 2 .",
    "the formal errors on the five values plotted for each galaxy are @xmath31.5 magnitudes , but the general behaviour of the set of curves suggest that their shapes and separation are significant .",
    "the star and open square symbols outline the extinction curves from 2 lmc stars by clayton et al ( 1996 ) .",
    "the longer wavelength schematic plots show the range of extinction curves derived in the smc and lmc from references given , and the solid line is the ccm curve for galactic extinction .",
    "note that our results appear to extend the extinction curves for the three galaxies in a straightofrward way .",
    "the structure in the fuse range curves is unlikely to be more than noise .",
