    "the luminosity density of the universe in the range from about 0.2@xmath1 m  to 2.2@xmath1 m , mid - uv to near - ir , is dominated by stellar emission .",
    "this wavelength range spans the peak in the spectra ( @xmath19 ) of stars with effective temperatures from about 20000k down to 2000k .",
    "therefore , measurements of the luminosity density in various broadbands across this range provide a powerful constraint on cosmic star - formation history ( sfh ) and/or a universal stellar initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "the stellar imf describes the relative probability of stars of different masses forming ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent reviews and analyses ) .",
    "its importance crosses many fields of astronomy from , for example , star formation ( testing theoretical models ) to cosmic chemical evolution ( heavy metal production from high mass stars ) .",
    "it is widely used in the study of the sfh of galaxies from their integrated spectra .",
    "generally , an imf is assumed and used as an input to evolutionary , stellar population , synthesis models , and these models are fitted to integrated spectra .",
    "the first calculation of an imf was made by @xcite based on the observed luminosity function of solar - neighborhood stars , converting to mass , correcting for main - sequence lifetimes and assuming that the star - formation rate ( sfr ) has been constant for the last 5gyr . despite the uncertainties in mass - to - light ratios , stellar lifetimes and the sfr , this result ( a power - law slope of @xmath20 measured from about 0.3 to 15 )",
    "is still commonly used today .",
    "logarithmic mass bins and @xmath21 wrt .  linear mass bins . ]    measurements of the solar neighborhood imf were reviewed by @xcite producing an imf with a mass fraction peak around 0.51  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : imfs ] ) .",
    "when applied to galaxy populations , this imf is unable to reproduce h@xmath8 luminosities @xcite , and applied to cosmic evolution , is unable to match observed mean galaxy colors @xcite due to a too low fraction of high - mass stars ( @xmath22 ) .    in a more recent review by @xcite , he concluded that the field star imf was of questionable use for a number of reasons ( e.g.  the derived imf in the range 0.91.4  depends strongly on the assumed solar - neighborhood sfh ) .",
    "instead , he summarized the results from studying star clusters in a triple - index power - law imf as an estimate of an average imf ( fig .",
    "[ fig : imfs ] ) .",
    "he also noted that `` if the existing empirical estimates of the imf are taken at face value , they present strong evidence for variations , and these variations do not seem to depend systematically on physical variables such as metallicity or stellar density ''",
    ". the observed imf variations from stellar counts could be largely due to statistical fluctuations and/or observational biases such as mass segregation within a star cluster @xcite .",
    "these points , if correct , mean that the concept of a universal imf is highly useful in the studies of integrated spectra of galaxies ( since they are mostly the result of many star - formation regions and episodes ) but the imf is still uncertain at the level of 0.5 in the power - law slopes . by ` universal imf ' , we mean an imf that represents the average in a significant majority of galaxies and over a significant majority of cosmic time .",
    "measurements of the cosmic luminosity densities represent the @xmath23 components of the `` cosmic spectrum '' which is the luminosity - weighted , average galaxy spectrum @xcite .",
    "thus , if there is a universal imf , it should certainly apply to this spectrum and constraints on the imf can be obtained by fitting population synthesis models .",
    "these constraints are degenerate with the assumed cosmic sfh .",
    "however , cosmic sfh is generally more accurately quantified than the sfh of any individual galaxy other than in the local group .",
    "for example , star - forming galaxies have been observed as far back as @xmath24 @xcite , and there is evidence for reionization as early as @xmath25 @xcite , which for a universe age of @xmath26gyr @xcite gives a time of 12.313.7gyr since the onset of a significant rate of star formation in the universe .",
    "the results for individual galaxies are often limited by age - metallicity degeneracy @xcite and recent bursts of star formation which can disguise their underlying age @xcite . given our knowledge of cosmic sfh , we can then place constraints on a universal imf by limiting the sfh we consider .",
    "the primary knowledge of cosmic sfh comes from measuring the comoving density of sfr indicators at various redshifts @xcite .",
    "these sfr indicators include uv luminosities and emission - line luminosities that are dominated by light from short - lived high - mass stars .",
    "the conversion to sfr depends on the imf .",
    "however , the _ relative _ cosmic sfh is well defined if the same indicator is used at each redshift regardless of the assumed imf . even if the indicator varies ( e.g.  0.2 to 0.3@xmath1 m  rest - frame uv ) , the derived cosmic sfh is less sensitive to the slope of the imf than the local luminosity densities ( 0.2 to 2.2@xmath1 m ) .",
    "it is this principal that enables constraints on a universal imf .",
    "an analysis of this type was applied by @xcite using various luminosity densities ( 0.15 to 2.2@xmath1 m ) spread over a range of redshifts ( 04 ) .",
    "they fitted cosmic sfhs for three different imfs . here",
    ", we use a more quantitative approach to constraining a universal imf slope and use more accurate , recent , local ( @xmath0 ) luminosity density measurements . note that we assume that there is a universal imf and do not constrain any variation in the imf between different galaxies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for evidence for an invariant imf ) .",
    "even if there is some variation , the results presented here could be regarded as constraints on a luminosity - weighted , average imf .",
    "to summarize , if the cosmic sfh is assumed to be known , based on measurements of various sfr indicators with redshift , then local luminosity density measurements provide a constraint on a universal stellar imf . the other principal factors to consider are chemical evolution ( metallicity ) and dust attenuation",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : lum - dens ] , we describe details of recent luminosity density measurements . the measurements are illustrated in figure  [ fig : lum - dens ] and summarized in table  [ tab : lum - dens ] . in section  [ sec : modeling ] , we describe our modeling and fitting procedure .",
    "a summary of the parameters used in the modeling is given in section  [ sec : summary - paras ] . in sections  [ sec : results ] and",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] , we present our results and conclusions .    [ cols=\"<,<,^,^ , < \" , ]     three attenuation - corrected h@xmath8 luminosity density measurements are summarized in table  [ tab : h - alpha ] .",
    "we do not quote error bars as the uncertainties are dominated by systematics .",
    "these include ( i ) subtraction of the stellar contamination which , in particular , affects the measurement of h@xmath27 and thus the estimate of the attenuation ( @xcite  @xcite included this uncertainty which amounted to 0.10.15 in the @xmath28 result ) , ( ii ) uncertainties in the attenuation curve ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which affect the conversion from a reddening measurement to absolute attenuation , and ( iii ) agn contamination .",
    "both the @xcite and @xcite results are based on obtaining the emission - line luminosity function from spectra . however , the selection criteria of the surveys are different , an emission - line objective - prism survey and @xmath29-band photometry , respectively .",
    "@xcite took a different approach of summing sdss spectra to form a cosmic optical spectrum before calculating the h@xmath8 and h@xmath27 luminosity densities .",
    "we take the mean of these three results for our fitting : @xmath30 this is appropriate since the @xcite and @xcite  results may be too high due to agn contamination which are enhanced by aperture affects .",
    "the spectra taken through a fiber are normalized to a broadband filter and since agn are centrally concentrated , any emission line luminosity due to them will be over enhanced .",
    "however , @xcite  did measure the weak oi 6300  line , suggesting that the agn contribution was only a few percent at most . the @xcite  result is probably too low because of the small survey ( i.e.  large scale structure ) and/or because it only includes ew@xmath3110  ( h@xmath8 , emission positive ) galaxies .    to compare this average measurement with model predictions",
    ", we use the output from pegase for the h@xmath8 flux without dust attenuation . as with the earlier fitting , the synthetic spectra are normalized to the @xmath32  band so we are really comparing the ratio of h@xmath8 and @xmath32   band fluxes between the models and the data .",
    "a correction is made for the fact that the measured @xmath32  band flux includes dust attenuation because we are fitting to an attenuation - corrected h@xmath8 measurement .",
    "we use the fiducial attenuation of @xmath33 .",
    "in other words , unlike the earlier fitting we now normalize the synthetic spectra to an attenuation - corrected luminosity density in the @xmath32   band .",
    "figure  [ fig : cont - halpha ] shows the results from fitting to the average attenuation - corrected h@xmath8 luminosity density .",
    "the degeneracy in @xmath27 versus @xmath34 is similar to that for the broadband luminosity densities .",
    "in addition , the best - fit imf slope , @xmath34 in the range 0.91.5 ( 68% conf .  assuming @xmath35 and averaging over the metallicity approximations ) , is in good agreement with the those results",
    "in this paper , we present the results of fitting spectral synthesis models with varying imfs to local luminosity densities .    * a good fit is obtained to the measurements of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite @xmath36-band ( compilation sbc@xmath37 ) with a best - fit metallicity of around solar .",
    "if we fit to the measurements of the first two papers and @xcite ( compilation sbh ) , the best fit metallicity is greater than twice solar and the results are inconsistent with solar metallicity at the 99.7% confidence level .",
    "* the data can be well fit by a universal imf and , therefore , there is no need to invoke imf variations .",
    "however , this provides only a weak constraint on the invariance of the imf because of significant degeneracies associated with this type of modeling . *",
    "the best - fit universal imf slope marginalized over a significant range of cosmic sfh ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) is @xmath2 based on an average between a closed - box approximation and a constant - metallicity approximation around solar ( using compilation sbav ) .",
    "our results are in good agreement with the salpeter imf slope . * a strong upper limit of @xmath7",
    "is obtained with 99.7% or 95% confidence depending on the metallicity approximation .",
    "this rules out the @xcite imf for a universal imf since the mass fraction of stars above 10  is similar to our parameterization with @xmath40 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : imfs ] , see also table  [ tab : publ - imfs ] ) .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by @xcite from fitting to luminosity densities over a range of redshifts and by @xcite from fitting to h@xmath8 ew - color relations for galaxies .",
    "@xcite  found a salpeter imf or an imf with @xmath41 provided adequate fits . here , we find that the latter slope does not provide a good fit to luminosity densities .",
    "this is principally because we have used more accurate local luminosity density measurements .",
    "if we increase our @xmath42 uncertainties by 0.05 at all wavelengths then we obtain @xmath7 with 80% confidence .",
    "* the stellar mass density of the universe is in the range 1.12.0 @xmath10 @xmath11 based on marginalizing over cosmic sfh and our parameterization of the imf .",
    "the current sfr density is in the range 0.74.1 @xmath13 @xmath14 .",
    "the total bolometric stellar emission ( 0.095@xmath1 m ) is known more accurately , naturally because we observe light and not mass , and is in the range 1.21.7 @xmath16 @xmath17  derived from the fitted pegase model spectra ( the mass - to - light ratio is @xmath431.4 / ) .",
    "we find that our dust model can reproduce the estimated total dust emission ( 0.30.7 @xmath16 @xmath17 , @xmath4451000@xmath1 m ) scaled from the far - ir luminosity density @xcite if we have @xmath45 ( @xmath4660% ) .",
    "note that this represents a limit on the cosmic spectrum attenuation , i.e. , a luminosity - weighted average by flux ( not magnitudes ) .",
    "* fitting to the local h@xmath8 luminosity density provides a similar result for the imf slope ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "this provides some evidence that our upper mass cutoff of 120  is a reasonable approximation because the sensitivity of the h@xmath8 flux to massive stars is different to that of the mid - uv to optical fluxes .",
    "more accurate measurements could test this upper mass limit . *",
    "the quantitative results on @xmath34 rely on the accuracy of the population synthesis model ( pegase ) .",
    "an alternative , qualitative result would be that there is consistency between the theory of evolutionary population synthesis ( evolutionary tracks and stellar spectra ) and the measurements of luminosity densities , cosmic sfh and an average mw imf derived from stellar counts ( e.g.   @xmath48 from * ? ? ?",
    "greater constraints can be placed on a universal imf both by improved accuracy in local luminosity density measurements ( in particular , @xmath49 to match the multi - wavelength sdss mgs ) and by improved accuracy of direct measures of cosmic sfh with redshift ( in particular , @xmath50 to @xmath512 ) . for the direct tracing of cosmic sfh ,",
    "it is important that the uv is measured at the same rest - frame wavelength in order to avoid imf dependency . in other words , we need an imf - independent cosmic sfh in order for the local luminosity densities to accurately constrain a universal imf or the imf - dependency should be quantified ."
