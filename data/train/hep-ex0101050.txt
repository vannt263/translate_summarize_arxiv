    "searches for rare and forbidden decays of charm are concerned with final states containing two charged leptons .",
    "such processes occur via flavor - changing neutral - current amplitudes , lepton - flavor - violating amplitudes ( leptons belonging to different families ) , or lepton - number - violating amplitudes ( leptons belonging to one family but having the same sign charge ) .",
    "diagrams for these amplitudes typically contain new types of particles having high masses ; thus , these decays probe energy scales which can not be accessed directly .",
    "for example , the amplitude for the flavor - changing neutral - current decay @xmath3  is expected to be proportional to @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a coupling constant and @xmath6 is the mass of some unknown propagator ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : feynman ] ) . the amplitude for the standard model decay",
    "@xmath7  is proportional to @xmath8 , and thus @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath10 , then @xmath11^{1/4}\\,.\\ ] ] inserting numbers one finds that a branching fraction @xmath12@xmath13 corresponds to a mass @xmath14  gev/@xmath15 .    over the past year , fnal e791 has published new limits on branching fractions for 24 different two- and three - body decay modes@xcite , and submitted for publication new limits for 27 additional three- and four - body decay modes@xcite . in most cases the e791 limits are the most stringent available . here",
    "we review these results and also briefly discuss competitive results from other fnal experiments .",
    "fnal e791 is a hadroproduction experiment studying the weak decays of charm mesons and baryons .",
    "the charm particles were produced by impinging a 500  gev/@xmath16 @xmath17 beam on five thin target foils . the most upstream foil consisted of platinum ; the other foils consisted of carbon ( diamond ) .",
    "all foils were separated by about 15  mm such that @xmath18 mesons decayed predominately in the air gaps between foils .",
    "the experimental apparatus@xcite consisted of a silicon vertex detector followed by a two - magnet spectrometer , two segmented cerenkov counters for hadron identification , an electromagnetic calorimeter for electron identification , and iron shielding followed by scintillator counters for muon identification .",
    "the downstream silicon vertex detector consisted of 17 planes of silicon and was used to reconstruct decay vertices downstream of the interaction vertex .",
    "the spectrometer consisted of 35 planes of drift chambers and two proportional wire chambers .",
    "the two dipole magnets bent particles in the horizontal plane and had @xmath19  kicks of + 210  gev/@xmath16 and + 320  gev/@xmath16 .",
    "the cerenkov counters contained gases with different indices of refraction ; together they provided @xmath20 discrimination over the momentum range 660  gev/@xmath16 .",
    "data were recorded using a loose transverse energy trigger .",
    "after reconstruction , events with evidence of well - separated interaction and decay vertices were retained for further analysis .",
    "the experiment took data from september , 1991 to january 1992 , recording the world s largest sample of charm decays at that time .",
    "the final number of reconstructed decays is over 200000 .",
    "e791 has searched for two- , three- , and four - body @xmath0 decays such as @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 ; and three - body @xmath1 and @xmath2 decays such as @xmath3  and @xmath24 . here and throughout this paper , charge - conjugate modes are included unless otherwise noted .",
    "the sensitivity of a search is determined ( or normalized ) by counting events in a topologically - similar hadronic decay channel such as @xmath25   for which the branching fraction is known .",
    "for all searches , the event selection proceeded via a `` blind analysis '' technique in order to avoid biasing the choice of selection criteria .",
    "this technique has three steps : ( a )  all events having a reconstructed mass within a mass window or `` box '' around @xmath26 are removed from the sample ; ( b )  the selection criteria are chosen by optimizing the ratio @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the number of signal events from a monte carlo simulation that pass all criteria , and @xmath29 is the number of events from data that are within a `` background box '' which is near but exclusive of the signal box ; ( c )  the finalized selection criteria are applied to the events within the signal box to see if any candidate events remain .",
    "the selection criteria resulting from this procedure are listed in tables  [ tab : qualitycuts ] and [ tab : pidcuts ] .",
    "the most important criterion is that of @xmath30 , which is defined as the distance between the interaction vertex and the decay vertex divided by the error in this quantity .",
    "values used for this criterion were 12 for @xmath0 and @xmath2 decays and 20 for longer - lived @xmath1 decays .",
