    "turbulent convection occurs frequently in stellar interiors and other astrophysical fluid flows . while convective motion naturally transports heat and chemical elements , the transport of angular momentum by convection in rotating bodies is a more subtle issue .",
    "it is of particular interest in the case of the sun , where the internal pattern of rotation has been measured but remains incompletely understood",
    ". it may also play an significant role in accretion flows .",
    "numerical simulations of astrophysical convection are becoming increasingly powerful and capable of resolving a widening range of length and time scales .",
    "nevertheless , a simpler , statistical description of turbulent transport is desirable in order to treat the effects of convection on the structure and evolution of stars .",
    "it almost goes without saying that such a description can not be derived strictly from the equations of fluid dynamics but must involve some modelling or parametrization .",
    "the mixing - length theory of turbulent transport was developed by prandtl ( 1925 ) and applied to stellar convection by biermann ( 1932 ) .",
    "it is still the basic model used in most calculations of stellar structure and evolution , usually in the form devised by bhm - vitense ( 1958 ) .",
    "the main purpose of mixing - length theory is to relate the convective heat flux to the superadiabatic gradient ; in this context it does not usually deal with the transport of ( angular ) momentum that arises in the presence of shear or rotation .    a standard theoretical approach to convection in differentially rotating stars is set out in the monograph by rdiger ( 1989 ) .",
    "angular momentum transport is described by a reynolds stress tensor whose components can be related to the large - scale mean flows and thermodynamical gradients .",
    "a first contribution to the reynolds stress is typically proportional to the angular velocity gradient through a turbulent viscosity coefficient .",
    "an important additional contribution comes from the @xmath1-effect ( named after lebedinsky ) , whereby even uniformly rotating convection transports angular momentum by virtue of its anisotropy .",
    "attempts to constrain or parameterize these quantities have been made through local numerical simulations ( e.g.  kpyl , korpi & tuominen 2004 ) or theoretical models ( e.g.  kitchatinov & rdiger 1993 ) .",
    "mean - field models of stellar rotation ( e.g. kitchatinov & rdiger 1999 , rempel 2005 ) have been developed which use such parameterized expressions for the reynolds stress and heat flux .",
    "reynolds - stress models of turbulent flows have been developed in the engineering community over several decades ( e.g.  pope 2000 ) .",
    "the exact equation governing the reynolds stress in a turbulent fluid can not be solved because of the well known closure problem whereby an infinite hierarchy of correlations is involved .",
    "nevertheless , by parametrizing the difficult terms in this equation , models can be constructed that bear some fidelity to the turbulent dynamics . from a more physical point of view , what is obtained is a time - dependent constitutive equation for the turbulent fluid , which relates the turbulent stress to the local history of deformation .",
    "there is a close similarity with models of non - newtonian fluids ( ogilvie & proctor 2003 ) . the advection and deformation of the turbulent stress are accurately represented since they derive from linear terms in the reynolds - stress equation , while the nonlinear ` relaxation ' effects are only modelled ( as is also true for non - newtonian fluids ) .    a similar approach can be applied to turbulent convection in which buoyancy forces play an essential role .",
    "the additional correlations that must be considered are the flux and the variance of entropy ( or temperature , in the boussinesq approximation ) .",
    "this approach offers some benefits over the conventional description in terms of a turbulent viscosity and a @xmath1-effect .",
    "it can be formulated in a covariant manner and is not tied to the spherical geometry of a slowly rotating star .",
    "it starts from a more fundamental description and allows phenomena such as the @xmath0effect to emerge in a natural way from more elementary considerations .",
    "it may also allow a more unified approach to be taken towards problems involving astrophysical turbulence .    in this paper",
    "we explore some of the consequences of a simple dynamical model of astrophysical convection of this type .",
    "the model derives from one originally conceived for magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in accretion discs ( ogilvie 2003 ) and later applied to rotating shear flows without magnetic fields ( garaud & ogilvie 2005 , go05 herafter ) .",
    "our motivation is to develop and test a model that can be applied to the convective zone of the sun , to other stars or to accretion discs .",
    "we emphasize , however , that our model is chosen to be as simple as possible for the purposes of this investigation .",
    "in contrast with some of the engineering literature , we restrict the algebraic complexity in order to retain a physical understanding of the terms in the equations .",
    "further refinements are likely to be required in order to provide an accurate match to a wide range of data .",
    "in comparing a closure model of astrophysical convection with experimental and numerical results , we face certain difficulties .",
    "astrophysical convection usually takes place at very high rayleigh number , in a highly turbulent regime .",
    "experiments have been conducted at very high rayleigh number but mainly for the rayleigh  bnard problem in which the flow is dominated by boundary layers , which may not be relevant in an astrophysical context , or by mean flows not represented in the closure model .",
    "an alternative system is provided by the homogeneous rayleigh  bnard problem , which has periodic boundary conditions in all directions .",
    "this model , however , has certain peculiarities of its own .",
    "these issues will be addressed in the sections that follow .    in the remainder of the paper ,",
    "we develop the closure model first in the boussinesq approximation ( section  2 ) and apply it to the standard rayleigh  bnard problem ( section  3 ) .",
    "we then consider the homogeneous rayleigh  bnard system with triply periodic boundary conditions ( section  4 ) ; in this section we also introduce rotation and discuss the @xmath0effect .",
    "we then adapt the model to the anelastic approximation for use in stars and other astrophysical flows ( section  5 ) and finally draw conclusions ( section  6 ) .",
    "a number of technical details are covered in the appendices .",
    "in the boussinesq approximation ( e.g. chandrasekhar 1961 ) the equations governing the motion of the fluid are @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4,\\ ] ] @xmath5 where we have adopted a cartesian tensor notation .",
    "the dynamical variables are the velocity @xmath6 , the density @xmath7 , the pressure @xmath8 and the temperature @xmath9 .",
    "quantities regarded as constant in the boussinesq approximation are the reference density @xmath10 , the reference temperature @xmath11 , the coefficient of expansion @xmath12 , the gravitational acceleration @xmath13 , the kinematic viscosity @xmath14 , and the thermal diffusivity @xmath15 .    a simple , static basic state is possible when the temperature is uniform and the pressure gradient balances gravity , i.e. @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a reference pressure . to examine departures from this state we define @xmath19 @xmath20 obtaining the governing equations",
    "@xmath22 @xmath23      we now adopt a standard procedure and separate the dynamical variables into mean and fluctuating parts , e.g. @xmath24 where the angle brackets or the overbar are interchangeably used to denote a suitable averaging operation such as a temporal , spatial or ensemble average .",
    "the mean parts of the governing equations are @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the reynolds tensor , representing ( minus ) the turbulent stress , and @xmath29 represents the turbulent heat flux density .",
    "the problem at hand is to determine @xmath30 and @xmath31 and thereby close the system of mean equations .",
    "we also introduce the quantity @xmath32 representing the temperature variance .",
    "it should be noted that all three quadratic correlations @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 will be redefined when we move on to the ( more relevant ) anelastic system in which the reference density is non - uniform , but these definitions are convenient for the boussinesq system .",
    "the fluctuating parts of the governing equations are @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 from these we can obtain exact equations for @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath39 in the form @xmath40",
    "@xmath41 @xmath42 the left - hand sides of these equations represent the linear interaction of @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath39 with the mean velocity gradient , the mean temperature gradient and the gravitational field , as well as their diffusion by the microscopic transport coefficients .",
    "there is no difficulty in treating such terms exactly as they appear .",
    "the right - hand sides of these equations contain difficult terms of three sorts : those involving correlations with the pressure fluctuation @xmath43 , those involving triple correlations of fluctuating quantities , and dissipative terms involving the microscopic diffusivities @xmath14 and @xmath15 . these effects can all be regarded as ` non - linear ' ; although viscous diffusion , for example , is a linear process , when the reynolds number is large the viscous terms can be significant only when a turbulent cascade has forced structure to appear on the dissipative scales .",
    "none of the terms on the right - hand sides of these equations can be written in terms of @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath39 without further knowledge of the statistical properties of the fluctuating quantities , such as the spectrum of the turbulence , which are determined by the non - linear physics of the turbulent cascade .",
    "we therefore attempt to model the system by retaining the exact forms of the left - hand sides and proposing simple closures for the right - hand sides , i.e. @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 where the quantities @xmath47 are non - linear tensorial functions of their arguments .",
    "the dots represent the parameters of the problem , on which the functions @xmath47 may depend .",
    "a simple example of such a model is @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the trace of the reynolds tensor , which is twice the turbulent kinetic energy per unit mass , and @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are positive dimensionless coefficients of order unity , of a universal nature .",
    "( coefficients @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are reserved for a magnetohydrodynamic extension of the model , see ogilvie 2003 )    the justification for introducing non - linear terms of the above form is similar to that used in the model of magnetorotational turbulent stresses originally introduced by ogilvie ( 2003 ) .",
    "the term involving @xmath52 causes a dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy , and allows for the free decay of hydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "the term involving @xmath53 redistributes energy among the components of @xmath30 , and corresponds to the tendency of hydrodynamic turbulence to return to isotropy through the effect of the pressure  strain correlation .",
    "both are constructed assuming that these effects occur on a timescale related to the eddy turnover time , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is defined as the typical scale of the largest turbulent eddies .",
    "terms @xmath54 and @xmath55 , related to the transport of heat , are advanced by simple analogy .",
    "the coefficients must satisfy certain conditions to ensure the realizability of the model , as discussed in appendix  a.    the terms proportional to the microscopic diffusion coefficients are introduced to allow a modelling of the correlation terms @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 at moderate reynolds number , i.e. close to the onset of convection .",
    "in such a situation a turbulent cascade does not form and the dissipative terms are proportional to , rather than independent of , the diffusion coefficients . in a similar way , for turbulent shear flows",
    ", go05 proposed to model the momentum diffusion term as @xmath64 on dimensional grounds .",
    "indeed , it is expected that near the onset of convection , most fluid motions will be on the largest scales of the system ( @xmath60 ) . by analogy , we model the other two terms here as @xmath65 therefore the dissipative term in each of equations ( [ dtrij])([dtq ] ) is modelled by a sum of two terms , one that is independent of the diffusivity and dominates at high reynolds numbers , and another that is proportional to the diffusivity and dominates at moderate reynolds numbers .",
    "this completes the justification for the form of the closure model proposed in equations ( [ eq : rprop ] ) , ( [ eq : fprop ] ) and ( [ eq : qprop ] ) .",
    "we now apply the closure model to the problem of rayleigh  bnard convection .",
    "we consider a horizontally infinite , plane - parallel system , where the bottom plate is located at height @xmath66 and the top plate at height @xmath67 .",
    "the relative temperature of the bottom plate is @xmath68 while that of the top plate is @xmath69 .    in this setup , we look for statistically steady and horizontally homogeneous solutions assuming that mean quantities and correlations between fluctuating quantities vary only with @xmath70 .",
    "we also assume that there are no mean flows in the system . equations ( [ eq : meancont])-([eq : meanenergy ] ) and ( [ eq : rprop])-([eq : qprop ] ) reduce to a set of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) which can be solved to obtain the temperature profile @xmath71 between the two plates , the profiles of the turbulent kinetic energy , @xmath72 , and the temperature variance , @xmath73 ( for example ) .    by analogy with prandtl s mixing - length formulation ( prandtl , 1932 ) we set @xmath60 , the size of the largest eddies , to be equal to the distance to the nearest wall , i.e.  @xmath74 ( see go05 for applications of the same principle to pipe flows and to couette ",
    "taylor flows ) .",
    "it can be shown with little effort that @xmath75 , as well as @xmath76 .",
    "the remaining set of five second - order odes fully characterizes the system : @xmath77 where @xmath78 . in the case of no - slip boundaries with fixed temperature on each plate as listed above , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath39 are zero on both boundaries .",
    "this system of odes with associated boundary conditions can be solved with a two - point boundary - value solver .",
    "typical solutions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : raplots ] for various rayleigh numbers , defined here as @xmath82 we set the prandtl number @xmath83 to  @xmath84 for the purposes of illustration .",
    "note the appearance of the characteristically flat temperature profile between the two plates as ra @xmath85 and of the thin thermal boundary layers .",
    "we now study in more detail the structure of the solution .      as in the case of shear flows past a wall ( see go05 ) , we can derive a universal profile for convection away from a wall .",
    "let us consider a semi - infinite domain @xmath86 , in which case @xmath87 , and let @xmath88 be the convective heat flux through the system .",
    "we define dimensionless variables via @xmath89^{1/4 } \\eta\\mbox {     ,    }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\bar f_z = f_0 f(\\eta ) , \\qquad   \\bar q = \\left [ \\frac{f_0 ^ 3 \\nu}{\\alpha g \\kappa^2 } \\right]^{1/2 } q(\\eta),\\nonumber\\\\ & &   \\bar \\theta - \\delta t =   \\left [ \\frac{f_0 ^ 3 \\nu}{\\alpha g \\kappa^2 } \\right]^{1/4 } \\theta(\\eta ) , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\bar r_{ij } = \\left [ \\frac{\\alpha g f_0 \\kappa^2}{\\nu } \\right]^{1/2 } r_{ij}(\\eta ) , \\label{eq : nondim}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that the system of equations ( [ eq : rbode ] ) becomes @xmath90 the boundary conditions at @xmath91 are @xmath92 .",
    "solutions very close to the wall @xmath93 satisfy : @xmath94 these simple relationships provide an ideal way of calibrating each of the three constants @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 individually ( see section  [ s : calibration ] ) , by analysing the power - law behaviour of the near - wall profiles of experimental or numerical data .",
    "solutions far away from the boundary layer can be expanded as @xmath98 where @xmath99 however , unlike @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 the constant @xmath103 can not be determined without a numerical calculation of the boundary - layer solution for @xmath104 .",
    "the scaling laws obtained for @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 far from the wall are expected on dimensional grounds , and recover the well - known solution of priestley ( 1954 ) .",
    "they are analogous to the universal `` log - law '' solutions for turbulent shear flows past a wall ( e.g. schlichting , 1979 ) . by comparing profiles of @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath108 with laboratory or numerical experiments , one can constrain some of the unknown coefficients @xmath109 ( see section  [ s : calibration ] ) .      the heat flux through the system in rayleigh  bnard convection is commonly measured by the dimensionless nusselt number @xmath110 which compares the total heat flux with the conductive one in the absence of convection . the universal convection - from - a - wall solution calculated in the previous section",
    "can be used to derive the relationship between the nusselt number and the rayleigh number .    indeed , by selecting a rayleigh number we set the relative temperature at the midpoint @xmath111 to be @xmath112 which implies through ( [ eq : nondim ] ) that @xmath113^{1/4 } \\theta\\left (   \\left [ \\frac{\\alpha g f_0}{\\kappa^2 \\nu } \\right]^{1/4 } \\frac{h}{2 } \\right )   \\mbox {    ,   } \\ ] ] yielding an equation for the ( unknown ) constant heat flux @xmath88 .",
    "in dimensionless terms , we have the implicit equation for @xmath114 : @xmath115^{1/4}=\\theta\\left({{\\textstyle\\frac{1}{2}}}[\\mathrm{ra}(\\mathrm{nu}-1)]^{1/4}\\right),\\ ] ] which can be solved to find @xmath116 . in the limit of very large rayleigh number",
    "the mid - point of the system is very far from the boundary layer , so @xmath117 which then recovers the standard scaling law ( malkus 1954 ) @xmath118 the constant @xmath103 depends only on pr and on the closure parameters @xmath119 , but can not easily be expressed analytically in terms of these parameters .",
    "the aim of this section is to estimate , in a rough sense , the parameters @xmath109 by comparing the model predictions with numerical simulations and laboratory experiments .",
    "this approach was successfully used in go05 on pipe flow data and couette  taylor data , yielding : @xmath120 under the assumption that the closure parameters are universal properties of the turbulent cascade , these estimated values should also apply to the case of turbulent convection without need for re - calibration .",
    "the remaining parameters @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath96 and @xmath121 may then be independently estimated . in the following sections , we first discuss this assumption in the light of known model limitations .",
    "we then select appropriate experimental datasets and use them to constrain the remaining parameters .",
    "as discussed by ogilvie ( 2003 ) and go05 the closure model proposed has two intrinsic limitations : it ignores some ( but not all ) of the effects of pressure - strain correlations @xmath122 , and assumes that the effect of all modelled terms ( such as the triple - correlations in ( [ eq : rprop])-([eq : qprop ] ) ) is local both in time and space . as a result , it may poorly represent strongly sheared systems or systems where the turbulent eddies exhibit a strong degree of spatial or temporal coherence .    the neglected effects of the pressure - strain correlations are not thought to be important in turbulent convection , except in the presence of strong rotation or of an externally driven strong mean shear ( where the timescale of rotation and shear is comparable to that of the convection )",
    ". the closure should be well - suited to model convection in stellar interiors , but maybe less so for convectively unstable accretion discs .",
    "we defer this particular case to subsequent work .",
    "however , for similar reasons these effects are also likely to be important in pipe flows or couette  taylor flow , which were used as a basis for calibrating the constants @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( see go05 ) .",
    "consequently , the estimates given in ( [ eq : c1c2 ] ) could be somewhat biased , in particular @xmath53 which contains information on the rate of return to isotropy . comparing the model with turbulent convection experiments ( see below )",
    "can therefore help refine the estimates for @xmath52 and @xmath53 using more appropriate data .    as mentioned above",
    ", the closure is also less reliable when applied to systems where the turbulence exhibits coherence over large scales or long timescales .",
    "this might pose some problems when applied to convection in a finite domain , since large - scale coherent plumes which span the whole system are commonly observed in most cases ranging from boussinesq to fully compressible systems .",
    "comparisons with experiments can help reveal which aspects of convective transport are adequately described by the model , and which are not .",
    "our application of the closure model to rayleigh - bnard convection in sections [ subsec : blbehavior ] and [ subsec : ranu ] assumes for simplicity that the system is horizontally invariant , while all laboratory and numerical experiments have a limited horizontal extent .",
    "the presence , nature and geometry of the side - walls are known to affect various properties of the turbulent convection , in particular through the generation of large - scale circulations ( often called `` wind '' ) .",
    "this wind influences the overall heat transport properties by changing the nature of the boundary layers ( castaing et al .",
    "1989 ; cioni et al .",
    "1997 ; grossmann & lohse 2000 , 2001 , 2002 , 2004 ) .",
    "it also induces large - scale horizontal inhomogeneities , so that the measured vertical profiles of mean quantities and higher - order moments may vary with position ( maystrenko , resagk & thess 2007 ) .",
    "while our formalism can in principle be applied to finite geometries and self - consistently model the effect of large - scale flows , such an extension is beyond the scope of the present paper .    in order to minimize the effect of side - walls we restrict the model comparison to experimental setups with very large aspect ratios ( defined as the ratio of the horizontal to vertical extent of the domain , and denoted as @xmath123 ) .",
    "there are a few large aspect ratio , high rayleigh number experimental studies which provide measurements of the nusselt number .",
    "of particular interest are results of fnfschilling et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for convection in water ( pr = 4.38 ) in a cylindrical enclosure of aspect ratio up to @xmath124 , for ra up to a few times @xmath125 .",
    "niemela & sreenivasan ( 2006 ) provide similar information for convection in helium ( 0.7 @xmath126 pr @xmath126 8) in a cylindrical container with @xmath127 , for rayleigh numbers between @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "finally , the ilmenau barrel experiments of dupuits , resagk & thess ( 2007 ) provide nu(ra ) for convection in air ( pr = 0.7 ) in a cylindrical enclosure with variable aspect ratio up to 11.3 , for rayleigh numbers up to a few times @xmath128 ( in the case of the largest aspect ratio ) .",
    "by contrast , only very few large aspect ratio experimental measurements of the boundary - layer profiles of velocity and temperature correlations ( such as @xmath30 , @xmath31 or @xmath39 ) have been reported .",
    "the largest aspect ratio experiments available ( @xmath130 ) with fully resolved boundary layer profiles are presented by dupuits , resagk & thess ( 2007 ) although the data provided is limited to the mean and rms temperature profiles . taking a different approach ,",
    "direct numerical experiments are a powerful tool for `` idealized '' experiments .",
    "horizontally periodic simulations minimize the effect of side - walls ( although retain a finite aspect ratio ) and permit resolved and precise measurements of all desired mean and fluctuating quantities within the flow .",
    "the main drawback is the limited range of parameter space for which resolved simulations can be run ( typically , ra @xmath131 for large aspect ratio simulations at pr @xmath132 ) .    for these reasons",
    ", we use a combination of experimental data ( dupuits , resagk & thess 2007 ) and numerical simulations to calibrate the remaining model parameters .",
    "our numerical simulations are all run for pr = 1 , in a horizontally periodic domain with aspect ratio @xmath133 , using a spectral method briefly described in appendix  b. the largest rayleigh number achieved in this case is ra @xmath134 .",
    "figure [ fig : rbeyecandy ] shows a typical snapshot of the results , in this parameter regime , for the temperature field for example .",
    "the results of the simulations are globally consistent with those of hartlep ( phd thesis , 2005 , gttingen ) .      very close to the wall ( @xmath135 ) , the closure model solutions for the normalized correlations @xmath105 , @xmath136 , @xmath106 , @xmath108 and @xmath107 are well approximated by power laws , as described in equation  ( [ sublayerprofile ] ) .",

    "moreover , we find that within fitting errors @xmath144 . given the quantities modelled by the associated diffusive terms ( see equations ( [ eq : cnumodel])([eq : ckappamodel ] ) ) , this result is not entirely surprising .    on the other hand , fig . [",
    "fig : rzzcal ] reveals an important caveat of the closure model when applied to rayleigh - bnard convection .",
    "the universal solution for the two horizontal stress components @xmath145 and @xmath146 can easily be deduced from @xmath147 .",
    "these horizontal stresses should therefore be identical to one another and have the same power - law dependence on @xmath148 as @xmath105 and @xmath136 , close to the wall and far from the wall . however , fig .",
    "[ fig : rzzcal ] clearly shows that the numerical data is at odds with the model .",

    "it is reassuring to see that the value of @xmath52 estimated by go05 from wall - bounded shear flow data adequately fits the far - from wall solution for @xmath136 in this convection problem .",

    "systems with roughly cubic geometry are dominated by the channel modes and are found to have very strongly fluctuating large - scale transport properties , but for larger aspect ratio the fluctuations are much smaller and the channel modes are inhibited ( bodo et al .",

    "the elevator modes continue growing unaffected by perturbations until the code fails , which seems to corroborate the premise that the secondary instabilities are inhibited in wider - than - tall boxes . for @xmath206 , the measured nusselt number eventually converges to a meaningful average and is found to scale as predicted by the closure model , namely proportional to ( pr ra)@xmath207 .",
    "a good fit with the model predictions is found by selecting @xmath208 .",
    "for the purpose of illustration , a snapshot of the temperature field for our largest rayleigh number , @xmath209 ( with pr = 1 ) and aspect ratio 1/2 is shown in figure [ fig : hrbeyecandy ] .",

    "this problem , which was identified by miller & garaud ( 2007 ) , can presumably be attributed to the incomplete modeling of the effects of the pressure - strain correlations which are known to play an important role in the limit of rapid rotation .",
    "it is therefore likely that these effects also cause our model to yield inaccurate predictions for @xmath235 in the same limit .",

    "rdiger & kitchatinov ( 1993 ) and ral05 assume the presence of a `` background '' turbulence caused by a given ( unspecified ) forcing mechanism , which , in the absence of rotation , is described by an eddy turnover time @xmath244 , a mixing length @xmath245 and a turbulent diffusivity @xmath246 .",
    "this background turbulence also may also have some degree of anisotropy , controlled by the parameter @xmath247 defined in our notation as @xmath248 where the superscript @xmath249 denotes turbulent quantities of the non - rotating system .",
    "note how @xmath250 for isotropic turbulence .",
    "ral05 show how the presence of rotation ( where the rotation axis lies at an angle @xmath210 from the vertical ) modifies the background turbulence , an effect which gives rise to non - diagonal components in the stress tensor .",
    "they argue that this phenomenon is controlled by the coriolis number @xmath251 defined as @xmath252 their eddy turnover time @xmath244 is naturally related to @xmath253 in our notation , so that , for the purpose of comparison we have @xmath254 where the proportionality constant is of order unity .    in the limit of slow rotation , ral05 predict a @xmath0effect through the following term : @xmath255 where the proportionality constant is the same as in equation ( [ eq : omegastar ] ) .",
    "meanwhile , our model when written in dimensional form and recast in terms of the anisotropy factor @xmath247 yields @xmath256 where @xmath257 is a dimensionless constant which depends only on the model parameters , and is given by equation  ( [ eq : norotlimit ] ) with ro@xmath258 .",
    "in the same slow - rotation limit , the other off - diagonal components of the stress tensor are @xmath259 or higher order in both our and their models .",
    "overall , the two formalisms agree on the dependence of the stresses on the rotation rate and on latitude , as expected on dimensional and geometrical grounds .",
    "in addition , both models explicitly demonstrate the importance of the anisotropy of the background non - rotating turbulence in controlling the amplitude of the @xmath1-effect .",
    "however , the dependence of @xmath260 on the anisotropy factor @xmath247 superficially appears to be different in the two theories .",
    "we interpret this in two ways .",
    "first , note that the anisotropy factor @xmath247 is a `` free '' parameter in the works of ral05 . in our model by contrast , there is no freedom in independently specifying @xmath247 since it is a solution of the model once the system is specified ( e.g. shearing flow , convective flow ) and depends on the @xmath109 parameters . in the hrb system for example @xmath261 .",
    "secondly , @xmath260 is directly proportional to @xmath247 in the model of ral05 while our model reveals an additional contribution to the @xmath1-effect arising from the background turbulent heat flux ( see equation ( [ eq : leffect ] ) for a more explicit expression ) .",
    "this contribution is missing from the model of ral05 which does not take into account the heat equation . as a result",
    ", one may superficially conclude that the @xmath1-effect could exist even for isotropic background turbulent convection . in practice , it is difficult to conceive of a naturally occurring isotropic turbulent system which has a non - zero vertical heat flux , so the term @xmath262 is in fact also indirectly related to the anisotropy of the system , although perhaps not exactly in the same way .",
    "finally , we emphasize that in the limit of rapid rotation , neither theory is expected to be accurate because of the extreme induced anisotropy of the rotating turbulent motions .",
    "nevertheless it is interesting to note that the predicted dependence of the stresses on the rotation rates now no longer agree with one another .",
    "we find that @xmath263 tends to a constant independent of rotation rate while ral05 find that @xmath264 ro .",
    "for the other off - diagonal components @xmath260 and @xmath182 we find a dependence on ro , while they predict a dependence on ro@xmath265 .",
    "we conclude this section by emphasizing the success of our closure model in reproducing numerical experiments of hrb convection at various aspect ratios and rayleigh numbers .",
    "furthermore our model predictions are exactly proportional to those of ral05 ( with a proportionality constant of order unity ) for convection in a slowly rotating system .",
    "hence we expect to recover many of the results and successes of these authors in modeling differential rotation in stars , albeit with an extended model which self - consistently includes heat transport in addition to angular momentum transport . in preparation of this future modeling endeavour",
    ", we finally turn to the next natural step of this work , namely the extension of the model to the anelastic and fully compressible equations .",
    "so far we have worked within the boussinesq approximation , which is applicable only to a shallow layer of fluid whose depth is much less than the density scaleheight . in order to apply our model to stars we must first adapt it to the anelastic approximation ( ogura & phillips 1962 ; gough 1969 ) , which is relevant to subsonic convection in a deep layer .    here",
    "we follow the more standard derivation of the anelastic approximation where the reference state is taken to be an adiabatically stratified fluid in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the reference density @xmath266 and temperature @xmath267 may vary substantially , while the specific entropy @xmath268 is uniform . in place of equations ( [ boussinesq1])([boussinesq3 ] )",
    "we have @xmath269 @xmath270 @xmath271 where the dots represent terms due to viscosity ( in the equation of motion ) and thermal conduction ( in the thermal energy equation ) , while @xmath272 is , again , a modified pressure .",
    "viscous dissipation can also be included in the thermal energy equation , although it is usually omitted in the boussinesq approximation .",
    "a derivation of these equations , omitting diffusive effects , is given in appendix  b. the anelastic system is formally very similar to the boussinesq system except for the variable density of the reference state .",
    "however , the entropy perturbation and background temperature gradient respectively play the roles taken by the temperature perturbation and @xmath273 in the boussinesq approximation .",
    "a very similar analysis to that carried out for the boussinesq system leads to equations for @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath39 of the form @xmath274",
    "@xmath275 @xmath276 where the dots represent terms that require a closure model . in the anelastic system the relevant definitions of the reynolds stress @xmath30 ,",
    "flux @xmath31 and variance @xmath39 are @xmath277 note that @xmath30 now has the correct dimensions for a stress tensor , and that @xmath31 is really an entropy flux density .",
    "some additional linear terms arise in the anelastic system because @xmath278 .",
    "we apply the same closure model as for the boussinesq system , except that the relaxation timescale which was proportional to @xmath279 is now proportional to @xmath280 because of the redefinition of @xmath30 : @xmath281 @xmath282 @xmath283 we do not include any of the terms proportional to @xmath14 or @xmath15 here because we consider the high - rayleigh number limit in the absence of rigid boundaries only .    the question arises as to how the length - scale @xmath60 should be identified for anelastic convection in a deep layer .",
    "it should probably related to the pressure scaleheight or density scaleheight , as in the stellar mixing - length theory .",
    "indeed , numerical simulations of convection in spherical shells with a substantial density variation indicate that the convective cells are much smaller near the outer surface where the scaleheight is small ; nevertheless , there may be situations in which convective plumes can span several scaleheights .",
    "equations  ( [ rij_anelastic])([q_anelastic ] ) can then be combined with equations for the mean variables in the form @xmath284",
    "@xmath285 @xmath286 in the last equation we have included the turbulent viscous heating .",
    "these equations could be applied to studying convection and meridional circulation in rotating stars .",
    "the solution can be assumed to be axisymmetric and independent of time , although for practical purposes it may be easier to evolve the equations forwards in time until a steady state is reached ( if it is ) rather than directly seeking such a solution .    in the absence of rotation the problem becomes spherically symmetric , the mean flow disappears , the stress becomes diagonal ( although anisotropic ) and we obtain the local algebraic system @xmath287 @xmath288 @xmath289 @xmath290 the solution is , by direct analogy with equations  ( [ eq : dimsols1])([eq : dimsols2 ] ) , @xmath291 with @xmath192\\rho_0l^2(-n^2),\\ ] ] where now @xmath292 in this situation the entropy gradient @xmath293 is not known in advance . however , to balance the thermal energy equation , @xmath294 , which implies that @xmath295 is a constant , determined by the luminosity generated by the core of the star .",
    "( this conclusion is modified if the radiative flux or any sources of energy such as turbulent viscous dissipation make an important contribution to the thermal energy equation . )",
    "then the above equations can be solved algebraically to find @xmath296 , @xmath79 , etc .",
    ", at each radius , assuming that a prescription for @xmath60 is given .",
    "the result is equivalent to a version of mixing - length theory .",
    "rotation couples radial and latitudinal transport of heat and momentum and induces large - scale entropy gradients and mean flows .",
    "however , if we assume that their effects can be ignored in the overall turbulent dynamics controlling the properties of the stresses , then the local @xmath0effect is easily recovered as an anelastic version of equation ( [ eq : leffect ] ) . as",
    "before , the only differences with the boussinesq case is that ( i ) the two terms containing @xmath297 , which have their origin in the eddy turnover time , should be replaced by @xmath298 and ( ii ) in expressing ( [ eq : leffect ] ) in dimensional form ( see equation ( [ eq : nondimrot ] ) ) , one must also replace @xmath299 by @xmath300 and @xmath301 by @xmath302 , as seen above . the resulting expression",
    "then directly links the turbulent transport of angular momentum and of heat to one another .",
    "since heat transport in this model is very similar to mixing - length theory , our formalism now provides a simple framework in which to combine models of stellar structure with models of internal stellar dynamics .",
    "note that in practice mean flows and especially latitudinal entropy gradients could play a role in the global dynamics of the system .",
    "the whole model should therefore be solved self - consistently and globally instead of using ( [ eq : leffect ] ) .",
    "this can only be done numerically and is deferred to a subsequent paper .",
    "it is also possible to ` import ' the model of anelastic convection into the full set of equations governing the motion of a compressible fluid .",
    "the idea here is that , while the convection might be assumed to be subsonic and to obey the anelastic approximation , the mean flow need not obey these constraints .",
    "an example is convection in an accretion disc , where the accretion flow , although slow , can not be treated in the anelastic approximation with a reference density profile .",
    "omitting now the bars on all quantities , and neglecting self - gravitation ( although it can easily be restored ) , we propose a system of equations consisting of the equation of mass conservation , @xmath303 the equation of motion , @xmath304 and the thermal energy equation , @xmath305 together with the equations of the closure model , @xmath306 @xmath307 @xmath308 the total energy is then exactly conserved in the form @xmath309}&\\nonumber\\\\    & & + \\partial_i\\left[\\rho({\\textstyle{{1}\\over{2}}}u^2+\\phi+h )    u_i+    { \\textstyle{{1}\\over{2}}}ru_i+r_{ij}u_j+    tf_i\\right]=0,\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath310 and @xmath311 are the specific internal energy and the specific enthalpy , respectively , and the gravitational potential @xmath312 is assumed to be independent of time .",
    "the existence of this conservation law implies a certain self - consistency in the equations of the model .",
    "the terms that were added in passing to the compressible model are required to have the form that they do in order that energy be conserved .",
    "we note again that @xmath34 is really an entropy flux density , and that @xmath313 is the corresponding energy flux density .",
    "the physical content of this model is that the turbulent convecting fluid behaves similarly to a complex , non - newtonian material in which there is a dynamical constitutive equation that relates the stress tensor to the deformation history of the fluid .",
    "the above equation for @xmath314 ( along with those for @xmath315 and @xmath316 ) plays this role .",
    "we have laid out the foundations of a new second - order closure model for the dynamics of turbulent convection , with future applications to stellar convective regions in mind .",
    "this model is a direct extension of the work of ogilvie ( 2003 ) and go05 , and has similar properties .",
    "the proposed closure has a straightforward physical interpretation , and well - understood limitations .",
    "comparison with laboratory and numerical experiments reveals good overall agreement of the model predictions with known properties of rotating shear flows ( go05 ) and high rayleigh - number rotating convection ( this work ) .",
    "in particular , our model naturally reproduces the standard scaling relationships between the rayleigh and nusselt numbers for rayleigh - bnard convection and for homogeneous rayleigh - bnard convection , and contains the well - known @xmath1-effect describing angular momentum transport in a rotating turbulent fluid .",
