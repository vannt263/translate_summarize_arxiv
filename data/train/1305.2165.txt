    "efficient multiplexing of signals in and out of multiple optical channels is central to both quantum and classical optical communication networks .",
    "this is accomplished using an add / drop device ( or filter ) .",
    "the channels are defined by a set of modes , and ideally , these modes are orthogonal field distributions .",
    "for example : a discrete set of frequencies ( wavelength - division multiplexing , wdm ) , or time - bins ( time - division multiplexing , tdm ) , or polarization ( polarization - division multiplexing , pdm ) .",
    "true multiplexing , meaning the ability to efficiently route , add , and drop signals between channels , can be accomplished using the above - mentioned schemes .",
    "a less powerful form of multiplexing is offered by using schemes that do not permit efficient signal routing , adding , and dropping , but do allow detection of signals in different channels .",
    "examples of this are optical code - division multiple access ( ocdma ) , quadrature amplitude modulation ( qam ) , and optical orthogonal frequency - division multiplexing ( ofdm ) @xcite . in those cases",
    "the detector has special capabilities that allow the separate detection of signals associated with different channels , but can not efficiently separate them into distinct spatial channels for routing .",
    "a goal is to accomplish true orthogonal - waveform multiplexing , which would allow signals in different optical channels defined by different orthogonal waveforms to be spatially separated @xcite .",
    "the waveforms making up the orthogonal basis set will be overlapping in both time and frequency spectra , so standard frequency or time separation techniques do not apply . because waveforms , or wave packets , have unique signatures in both time and frequency , we will call a system based on such a scheme orthogonal time - frequency - division multiplexing ( otfdm ) .    nonlinear optical processes such as three - wave mixing ( twm )",
    "have previously been applied to quantum networking in the context of improving infrared single - photon detection efficiency by up - conversion @xcite , and wdm by down - conversion @xcite .",
    "an important step toward optical otfdm was made by the group of c. silberhorn , who proposed an optical ` pulse gate ' based on nonlinear sum - frequency generation by twm @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to explore this twm frequency conversion scheme theoretically , with the introduction of analytical tools that help clarify the physics .",
    "specifically , we want to check a conjecture that the optimum operating regime for shape - selective and efficient frequency conversion is that in which one of the signals copropagates with the same group velocity as the pump pulse @xcite .",
    "the results are applicable to classical and quantum frequency conversion .",
    "related results have also been explored for the case of four - wave mixing @xcite .",
    "we are concerned with sum / difference frequency generation processes involving three - wave mixing in any @xmath2-nonlinear medium .",
    "we designate the pulse - carrier frequencies of the three participating field channels as @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , where @xmath5 is the strong - pump channel , and @xmath3 , @xmath4 are the weak signal and idler channels ( we assume @xmath6 ) . though we account for group velocity mismatch between the channels , we restrict our analysis to sufficiently narrow - band ( broad duration ) pulses so as to neglect higher order effects such as group velocity dispersion .",
    "starting from the standard three - wave interaction equations for these channels and assuming a strong non - depleting pump pulse , an appropriate choice of channel carriers and polarizations that ensures energy conservation @xmath7 , and phase - matching @xmath8 yields the following evolution equations in the spatio - temporal domain@xcite : @xmath9 where for @xmath10 , @xmath11 are the group slownesses of pulses with carrier - frequency @xmath12 ( in any arbitrary frame ) , and @xmath13 is a measure of the mode - coupling strength , which is a product of the effective @xmath2-nonlinearity coefficient and the pump power .",
    "we assume the pump pulse is strong enough that it remains unaltered by the interaction , but not so strong as to affect the group velocities of the signal / idler pulses .",
    "the mode - amplitudes @xmath14 can be interpreted either as the quantum wavefunction amplitudes in the single - photon case @xcite , or as the pulse - envelope functions in the slow - varying envelope approximation in the classical - pulse limit : @xmath15.\\tag{2}\\label{2}\\ ] ] we assume the field - polarizations of the three channels are fixed for optimal phase - matching , and hence treat them as scalar fields .",
    "the pump amplitude is square - normalized @xmath16 .",
    "we denote the length of our uniform - medium with @xmath17 , and assume the interaction starts at @xmath18 . the solutions to eqs . and can be represented using the green function ( gf ) formalism , thus : @xmath19 where @xmath20 are the input amplitudes and @xmath21 are the output amplitudes for @xmath22 . the overall gf is unitary , but the block transfer functions ( @xmath23 ) by themselves ,",
    "we can affect the gf of the process by varying the medium length ( @xmath17 ) , pump power ( @xmath13 ) , pump pulse - shape ( @xmath24 ) and the group - slownesses ( inverse group velocities ) of the various channels ( @xmath25 ) . if the gf is ` separable ' , i.e. @xmath26 , then with sufficient pump power , an incident _ s_-channel signal of temporal shape @xmath27 can be @xmath28 converted into the outgoing _",
    "r_-channel packet @xmath29 , and any incoming signal that is orthogonal to @xmath27 will be left unconverted . in general",
    "however , the gf is not separable .",
    "the ability to separate temporal modes becomes easier to quantify if we represent the gf with its singular - value decomposition @xcite : @xmath30 the functions @xmath31 are the input `` schmidt modes '' and @xmath32 are the corresponding output schmidt modes for the _ r _ and _ s _ channels respectively .",
    "these functions are uniquely determined by the gf , and form orthonormal bases in their relevant channels .",
    "the `` transmission '' and `` conversion '' schmidt - coefficients ( singular values ) @xmath33 and @xmath34 are constrained by @xmath35 to preserve unitarity .",
    "it is convenient to choose the mode - index ` n ' in decreasing order of schmidt mode conversion - efficiency ( ce ) ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the process is deemed perfectly mode - selective if the ce @xmath37 , and @xmath38 for every @xmath39 ( i.e. , the twm process performs full frequency conversion on one particular input mode and transmits all power from any orthogonal mode in the same input channel ) .",
    "we can quantify the add / drop quality of the gf using the ordered - set of conversion efficiencies to define an add / drop ` selectivity ' : @xmath40 we call the factor @xmath41 the ` separability ' , and the additional multiplier ( @xmath42 ) is the ce of the dominant temporal mode .",
    "the selectivity characterizes both the degree of separability of the gf and the process efficiency . the equality in eq",
    ". holds for a perfect add / drop device .",
    "the unitary nature of the transformation imposes a pairing between the schmidt modes across the _ r _ and _ s _ channels @xcite .",
    "consider arbitrary input and output fields expressed as discrete sums over corresponding schmidt modes : @xmath43 the coefficients @xmath44 are pairwise related via a unitary beam - splitter - like transformation @xcite , which , if we assume real @xmath45 and @xmath46 , are expressed as : @xmath47 where the @xmath48-schmidt mode ce ( @xmath49 ) is analogous to `` reflectance '' .",

    "the form of the gf in frequency domain can also provide meaningful insights .",

    "we can develop an important guide to the different regimes of twm by solving the problem for small interaction strengths ( @xmath13 ) for arbitrary group slownesses and pulse shapes ( following the discussion in @xcite ) .",
