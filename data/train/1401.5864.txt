    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the brightest electromagnetic explosions in the universe ( for a recent review , see gehrels et al .",
    "because of their very high luminosity , grbs can be detected out to the edge of the visible universe ( ciardi & loeb 2000 ; lamb & reichart 2000 ; bromm & loeb 2002 , 2006 ) . the farthest grb to date is grb 090429b with a photometric redshift @xmath8 ( cucchiara et al .",
    "2011 ) , significantly larger than those of the most distant quasars .",
    "this property makes grbs indispensable beacons to study the early universe , including the star formation rate ( totani 1997 ; wijers et al .",
    "1998 ; porciani & madau 2001 ; bromm & loeb 2002,2006 ) , the intergalactic medium ( igm ) ( barkana & loeb 2004 ; inoue et al . 2007 ;",
    "mcquinn et al .",
    "2008 ) , and the metal enrichment history ( savaglio 2006 ; wang et al .",
    "in addition , grbs have been used as standard candles to constrain cosmological parameters and dark energy ( dai , liang & xu 2004 ; schaefer 2007 ; wang , qi & dai 2011 ) .    the most popular theoretical model of long - duration grbs is the collapse of a massive star to a black hole ( woosley 1993 ) .",
    "observations also show that grbs are associated with type ib / c supernovae ( stanek et al . 2003 ; hjorth et al . 2003 ) .",
    "so grbs provide a complementary technique for measuring the sfr history ( totani 1997 ; wijers et al .",
    "1998 ; porciani & madau 2001 ) .",
    "recent studies show that _ swift _ grbs are not tracing the star formation history measured by traditional means exactly but including an additional evolution ( le & dermer 2007 ; salvaterra & chincarini 2007 ; kistler et al .",
    "2008 ; yksel et al . 2008 ; wang & dai 2009 ; wanderman , & piran 2010 ; qin et al . 2010 ; cao et al . 2011 ; robertson & ellis 2012 ; but see elliott et al . 2012 ) . the sfr inferred from the high - redshift ( @xmath9 ) grbs seems to be too high in comparison with the one obtained from some high - redshift galaxy surveys ( kristler et al . 2009 ; bouwens et al . 2009 ) .",
    "kistler et al . ( 2008 ) found that there are about four times as many grbs at redshift @xmath10 than expected from star formation measurements .",
    "they claimed that some unknown mechanism is leading to an enhancement about @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) in the observed rate of high - redshift grbs .",
    "using more _ swift _ data , kistler et al .",
    "( 2009 ) found a slightly lower value of enhancement about @xmath13 .",
    "robertson & ellis ( 2012 ) found the value of @xmath14 is about @xmath15 by comparing the cumulative redshift distribution of grbs and sfr .",
    "but on the other hand , elliott et al .",
    "( 2012 ) found that the value of @xmath14 is about zero using a small sample of grbs . in order to explain this discrepancy ,",
    "many models have been proposed .",
    "li ( 2008 ) explained the observed discrepancy between the grb rate history and the star formation rate history as being due to cosmic metallicity evolution ( langer & norman 2006 ) , by assuming that long grbs tend to occur in galaxies with low metallicities .",
    "cheng et al .",
    "( 2010 ) suggested that this discrepancy could be solved if some high - redshift grbs are produced by superconducting cosmic strings .",
    "wang & dai ( 2011 ) used an evolving initial mass function ( imf ) of stars to explain the grb redshift distribution .",
    "virgili et al .",
    "( 2011 ) discussed the possibility that the evolution of the grb luminosity function break with redshift may explain this discrepancy .",
    "observations also show differences in the population of grb host galaxies compared to expectations for an unbiased star - formation tracer ( tanvir et al .",
    "2004 ; fruchter et al .",
    "2006 ; svensson et al .",
    "2010 ) .    in this paper , we study the star formation rate history derived from grbs .",
    "first we use the _ swift _ grb sample to test the evolution of grb rate relative to sfr .",
    "if grbs trace star formation in the universe without bias , the ratio of the grb rate to the sfr would not be expected to vary with redshift .",
    "we find that this ratio is proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "the index is smaller than the value of kistler et al .",
    "we also derive the high - redshift sfr using _ swift _ grb sample by correcting this evolution .",
    "then , we consider the rapidly rotating metal - poor stars with masses smaller than critical mass @xmath16 to see if they can produce grbs to explain the discrepancy between high - redshift sfr and grb rate .",
    "the collapsar model indicates that stars with mass larger than @xmath17 can produce grbs ( woosley 1993 ; bissaldi et al .",
    "2007 ; raskin et al .",
    "observation also shows that the progenitor of grb 060505 has a mass above @xmath18 ( thne et al .",
    "yoon & langer ( 2005 ) investigated the evolution of rotating single stars in the mass range @xmath19 at low metallicity .",
    "they found that if the initial spin rate is high enough , the time scale for rotationally induced mixing becomes shorter than the nuclear time scale .",
    "the star may evolve in a quasi - chemically homogeneous way .",
    "in particular , for low enough metallicity , this type of evolution can lead to retention of sufficient angular momentum in cores to produce grbs according to the collapsar scenario .",
    "last , we calculate the impact of this grb - inferred star formation rate on the reionization history , including the optical depth of electron scattering to the cosmic microwave background .    the structure of this paper is arranged as follows .",
    "in the next section , we compile the _ swift _ grb sample till grb 110403 and test the evolution of grb rate .",
    "the sfr derived from grbs is given in section 3 .",
    "we show the model of grbs from chemically homogeneous evolution scenario and the influence on high - redshift sfr derived from grbs in section 4 . we compute the reionization history with this grb - inferred sfr in section 5 .",
    "we conclude with a summary in section 6 .",
    "the expected redshift distribution of grbs is @xmath20 where @xmath21 represents the ability both to detect the trigger of burst and to obtain the redshift , @xmath22 accounts for the fraction of stars producing grbs , @xmath23 is the sfr density .",

    "this removes many low - redshift , low-@xmath44 bursts that could not have been seen at higher redshift . because the sfr at high redshift is poorly known ( bouwens et al .",

    "the collapsar model explains grb formation via the collapse of a rapidly rotation massive iron core into a black hole ( woosley 1993 ) .",
    "this collapse model requires the initial mass of the massive stars with masses larger than about @xmath17 ( woosley 1993 ; bissaldi et al . 2007 ) .",
    "yoon & langer ( 2005 ) and woosley & heger ( 2006 ) showed that at low metallicity , quasi - chemically - homogeneous evolution of rapidly rotating stars with low masses can lead to the formation of rapidly rotating helium stars which satisfy all the requirements of the collapsar scenario . because the rotation affects the evolution of stars significantly , especially through rotationally induced chemical mixing ( maeder & meynet 2000 ; heger et al .",
    "the star remains chemically homogeneous evolution scenario ( ches ) .",
    "the ches is recognized as a promising path towards collapsars in connection with long grbs .",
    "yoon , langer & norman ( 2006 ) showed that at low metallicity ( @xmath5 ) , quasi - chemically - homogeneous evolution of rapidly rotating stars with masses larger than 12@xmath82 can lead to long grbs .",
    "we call this type of grbs as chemically homogeneous grbs ( chg ) below .",
    "if stars in the same mass range have high metallicities and slow rotation , they will die as type ii supernovae ( see figure 3 of yoon et al .",
    "this picture has also been confirmed by observation ( fruchter et al 2006 ) .",
    "we study the rate of chg from chemically homogeneous evolution scenario as follows .",

    "this extrapolation has been widely used in literature ( langer & norman 2006 ; li 2008 ; robertson & ellis 2012 ) .",
    "we set @xmath100 .",
    "as discussed by yoon , langer & norman ( 2006 ) , the grb production in ches is limited to metallicity @xmath101 . within the ches , the fraction of stars which forms a long grb depends on the semi - convective mixing , and the distribution function of initial stellar rotation velocities , @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the initial rotation velocity and @xmath104 is the keplerian velocity .",

    "the low metallcity and rapid rotation can lead to efficiently produce grbs in two ways .",
    "first , rapid rotation keeps the stars chemically homogeneous and thus avoids the formation of a massive envelope , so stellar core is free of spin - down due to magnetic core - envelope coupling .",
    "second , the stellar wind is weak at low metallicity , so this reduces spin - down due to stellar winds .",
    "our fitting results confirm this idea .",
    "we also calculate the reionization history using the grb - inferred sfr , and find that this sfr can maintain cosmic reionization over @xmath7 and reproduce the observed optical depth of thomson scattering to the cosmic microwave background .",

    "<S> the collapsar model of long gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) indicates that they may trace the star formation history . </S>",

    "<S> the collapsar model explains grb formation via the collapse of a rapidly rotating massive star with @xmath0 into a black hole , which may imply a decrease of sfr at high redshift . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find that the _ swift _ grbs during 2005 - 2012 are biased tracing the sfr , including a factor about @xmath1 , which is in agreement with recent results . after taking this factor , </S>",
    "<S> the sfr derived from grbs does not show steep drop up to @xmath2 . </S>",

    "<S> the chemically homogeneous evolution scenario ( ches ) of rapidly rotating stars with mass larger than @xmath3 is recognized as a promising path towards collapsars in connection with long grbs . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that the stars in the mass range @xmath4 for low enough metallicity @xmath5 with the grb efficiency factor @xmath6 can fit the derived sfr with good accuracy . combining these two factors , we find that the conversion efficiency from massive stars to grbs is enhanced by a factor of 10 , which may be able to explain the excess of the high - redshift grb rate . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the cosmic reionization history using the derived sfr . </S>",
    "<S> the grb - inferred sfr would be sufficient to maintain cosmic reionization over @xmath7 and reproduce the observed optical depth of thomson scattering to the cosmic microwave background . </S>"
