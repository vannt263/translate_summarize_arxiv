    "a rydberg state should be exactly midway between two other rydberg states of the opposite parity [ fig .",

    "the electric field corresponding to the frster resonance has certain values defined by the polarizabilities and energy spacing of rydberg states in a zero field . upon appropriate experimental conditions ( highly stable and homogeneous electric field , absence of stray electric fields , weak dipole - dipole interaction ) , stark - tuned frster resonances can be as narrow as a few millivolts per centimeter [ 5 ] .    in our earlier papers",
    "[ 6 - 8 ] we studied the line shape of the frster resonance @xmath2 in cold rb rydberg atoms excited by a broadband pulsed laser radiation via a three - photon transition .",
    "the resonance was recorded by slowly scanning a weak electric field near the resonant value of 1.79  v / cm [ fig .",
    "when the field was scanned by @xmath00.2  v / cm , the frequency of the optical transition @xmath3 on the third excitation step changed by tens of megahertz due to the stark effect .",
    "this frequency change was unimportant for broadband pulsed radiation as the radiation line width was much broader ( @xmath010  ghz ) .",
    "however , an electric - field pulse was applied at the moment of laser excitation to pull out the cold rb photoions formed due to photoionization by the intense pulsed laser radiation ; otherwise , the frster resonance became asymmetrical due to inhomogeneous electric fields from the photoions [ 8 ] .",
    "in our recent experiments [ 2,9,10 ] we have switched to three - photon excitation by narrowband cw lasers .",
    "this prevents the appearance of photoions , since the laser intensities used are much lower than those for pulsed excitation , and the pulling electric - field pulse is not required .",
    "however , scanning the electric field by just 50  mv / cm shifts the rydberg level out of resonance with the laser radiation , as the cw lasers have line widths below 1 mhz [ 9 ] . in order to avoid this problem , one needs to apply a stark - switching technique [ 11 - 14 ] to excite the atoms first in a fixed electric field and then to induce the interactions in a lower electric field , which is scanned across the frster resonance [ 10,13 ] , as shown in fig .",
    "we have found that the transients at the edges of the controlling electric pulses strongly affect the line shapes of the frster resonances , since the population transfer at the resonances occurs on a time scale of @xmath0100  ns , which is comparable with the duration of the transients .",
    "for example , a short - term ringing at a certain frequency causes additional radio - frequency ( rf)-assisted frster resonances , while non - sharp edges lead to asymmetry ( see fig .  3 ) .",
