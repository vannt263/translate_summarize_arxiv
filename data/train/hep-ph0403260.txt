    "one of the most celebrated features of the standard model of particle physics is that the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) is suppressed by the gim mechanism .",
    "all contributions to the fcnc processes arise at loop level , which are further suppressed by either small mass differences between different generations or small generation mixing angles .",
    "in fact , the mixing between the first two generations is suppressed because of the small quark masses ( and thus small mass differences ) and the mixing containing the third generation is suppressed because of the small entries of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix .",
    "extensions of the standard model generically do not have such a suppression mechanism and thus tend to suffer too large fcnc .",
    "this fact gives stringent constraints on how new physics beyond the standard model should be .",
    "put another way , it implies that signals of a beyond - the - standard - model may be revealed in flavor physics .    nowadays a special attention",
    "is paid to the flavor mixings in b mesons . on the experimental side ,",
    "b - factories are in operation , with a lot of new results on the nature of the flavor mixings of the b mesons . on the theoretical side",
    ", the fact that the quark masses are hierarchical in inter - generations implies that the third generation may be special and a new physics may manifest itself there .    among other things ,",
    "a very interesting process is @xmath2 whose cp asymmetry is measured at the b factories .",
    "theoretically a new physics contribution may easily be seen in this process because there is no tree - level contribution in the standard model .",
    "the latest result of the belle collaboration announced that the discrepancy from the standard model in the cp asymmetry of @xmath2 is still there @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath3 while that of the babar collaboration @xcite @xmath4 is consistent with the standard model prediction . though the situation is yet unclear , one certainly has to watch what is happening when more data are accumulated , and on the theoretical side it is important to investigate in what situation new physics can generate large @xmath5 transition .    here",
    "we consider supersymmetric models , a promising framework to solve the gauge hierarchy problem . a new source of flavor mixing originates from susy breaking masses of squarks and sleptons .",
    "the flavor mixing between the second and third generations both in left - handed squarks ( ll ) and in right - handed squarks ( rr ) can make contribution to @xmath2 .",
    "combined with flavor - conserving left - right squark mixing which is proportional to @xmath6 , with @xmath7 being the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets , the flavor mixing in the left - right squark mixing can also be induced .",
    "the flavor mixing in the rr sector can be generated by renormalization group effects of right - handed neutrino yukawa couplings if the theory is grand unified .",
    "the implications to the cp asymmetry of @xmath8 and other processes were studied intensively  @xcite .",
    "more general analyses were also done in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a notable observation has recently been made in ref .",
    "@xcite , which has found that the present experimental bound on the electric dipole moment ( edm ) of mercury atom severely constrains the cp violating part of a product of the ll and rr down - type squark flavor mixing between the 2nd and the 3rd generations .",
    "radiative corrections ( renormalization group effects ) due to yukawa interaction for up - type quark masses generate significant flavor mixing in the ll sector when one considers the high scale susy breaking scenario where the mediation of the susy breaking takes place at a high energy scale . given the non - negligible mixing in the ll sector at the electroweak scale , the bound from the @xmath9hg edm",
    "thus practically constrains the flavor mixing in the rr sector .",
    "it has been shown that with the parameters satisfying the constraint the contribution to the cp asymmetry of the @xmath2 decay from the rr mixing is negligibly small .",
    "we are thus led to consider the ll mixing in the squark masses as a possible source of the beauty to strange transition in the susy models . in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", we have discussed the constraint on the ll flavor mixing coming from the hg edm . in this case",
    "the dominant contribution is from chargino - squark loop and thus it is not as large as the gluino - squark loop contribution .",
    "thus one expects that the susy contribution to the cp asymmetry of the @xmath2 decay can be considerably large even when presently known constraints including that from the hg edm are taken into account .",
    "a purpose of the present paper is to quantify this prospect .",
    "we will exhibit our numerical study on the cp asymmetry of @xmath2 .",
    "we emphasize that the new constraint from the hg edm will be taken into account , in addition to the well - known constraint from @xmath1 .",
    "we will show that the susy contribution to the cp asymmetry can , in fact , be large when @xmath7 is large even after the constraints are imposed .",
    "we will also observe that the constraint from the hg edm is in general comparable to that of @xmath1 in severity , and which of the two is more stringent depends on the parameters chosen .",
    "this illustrates the importance of the new constraint from the hg edm discussed in our previous paper .",
    "before going to the flavor changing processes , we would like to briefly state the flavor structure of the squark mass matrices assumed in this paper .",
    "the soft susy breaking sfermion masses are given at a very high energy scale , which are driven down to low energy by renormalization group flow .",
    "the flavor violation in the sfermion masses thus has two sources : one is imprinted at the high energy scale , and the other one is due to renormalization group effects . in the minimal supergravity , there is no imprinted flavor violation in the sfermion masses , and the flavor mixing comes only from that of the yukawa coupling matrices . in the minimal supersymmetric model , the flavor mixing arises solely in the su(2)@xmath10 doublet ( left - handed ) squark mass matrix ( ll sector ) and cp phase is proportional to the kobayashi - maskawa cp phase in the quark yukawa coupling matrix .",
    "thus in this case the susy contribution to the cp asymmetry of @xmath2 is not expected . on the other hand , in a grand unified theory with right - handed neutrino yukawa couplings , the su(2)@xmath10 singlet ( right - handed ) down - type squarks ( rr sector )",
    "have flavor mixing as well as new cp violation .",
    "it was argued that this gives a sizable susy contribution to the cp asymmetry of @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "however the cp phase would make too large a contribution to the hg edm unless there is unplausible cancellation between different diagrams @xcite .",
    "our hypothetical flavor - mixing with new cp phase in the su(2)@xmath10 doublet ( left - handed ) squarks , namely in the ll sector , is likely due to the imprinting at the ultra high energy scale , where the flavor violation of the squark masses appears from the beginning .",
    "namely we assume that the initial soft susy breaking masses are given such that flavor violation arises only in the ll sector .",
    "furthermore we assume that the renormalization group effect which causes flavor mixing solely comes from the ckm matrix .",
    "the latter implies that , in the context of gut , either the right - handed neutrino yukawa couplings are small or the soft masses arise below the gut scale .",
    "we anticipate existence of alignment mechanism of quark / squark masses and mixing which realizes the required squark flavor mixing pattern , possibly due to flavor symmetry or geometry of extra dimensions . actually the democratic sfermion mechanism advocated in ref .",
    "@xcite can give this mass pattern : the flavor mixing in the right - handed down - type squarks , which form @xmath12 multiplet with left - handed ( s)leptons , is argued to be absent due to non - trivial interplay with neutrino mass matrix . here we will not pursue possible alignment mechanisms to realize this structure of the squark mass matrices any further in this paper . rather we simply assume this structure and consider its phenomenological implications .",
    "let us turn to susy contributions to @xmath2 .",
    "the time dependent cp asymmetry of the @xmath2 is defined as @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are given by @xmath16 here @xmath17 is defined as @xmath18 the ratio @xmath19 is evaluated from the @xmath20 mixing and is approximately parameterized as @xmath21 .",
    "if the decay amplitude is almost determined by the sm diagrams and there is no additional cp violation , the ratio @xmath22 is real and the cp asymmetry @xmath15 becomes the same as the one measured by the @xmath23 process , @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the susy contributions to @xmath2 in the decay amplitudes is , however , generically comparable to the sm one because the latter is loop suppressed .",
    "then the cp asymmetry @xmath15 deviates from the value by @xmath23 .",

    "the corresponding wilson coefficients @xmath34 are evaluated from the diagrams in which the the heavy sm or the susy particles propagate virtually . in the low energy region , these coefficients have two sources of flavor violation : the ckm matrix and squark mass matrices .",
    "the squark flavor mixings are denoted by the following squark flavor mixing parameters in the mass insertion approximation ( mia ) @xmath35    first , we consider the flavor mixing whose origin comes from the squark mass terms .",

    "in this paper , we revisited the susy contribution to the cp asymmetry of @xmath2 , in the light of the recently found constraint from the mercury edm . ref .",
    "@xcite had pointed out that the flavor mixing of the squarks in the rr sector receives a very severe constraint from the mercury edm , provided that the 2nd and 3rd generation mixing in the ll sector is generated non - zero by renormalization group effect from the quark yukawa couplings . thus the flavor mixing in the rr sector",
    "will not give significant contribution to the @xmath2 cp asymmetry , unless the constraint from the mercury edm is ameliorated by accidental cancellation . this argument",
