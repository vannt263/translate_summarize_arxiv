    "there is strong evidence for the existence of a substantial amount of cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "the leading cdm candidates are weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , for example , the lightest neutralino in supersymmetric models with @xmath2 parity . with a small cosmological constant ,",
    "the cdm scenario is consistent with both the observations of the large scale structure of the universe ( scales much larger than @xmath3mpc ) and the fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background  @xcite .",
    "however , the collisionless cdm scenario predicts too much power on small scales , such as a large excess of dwarf galaxies  @xcite , the over - concentration of dark matter ( dm ) in dwarf galaxies  @xcite and in large galaxies  @xcite . to solve this problem , two of us with their collaborators proposed a scenario based on non - thermal production of wimps , which can be relativistic when generated .",
    "the wimps comoving free - streaming scales could be as large as or possibly even larger than 0.1 mpc .",
    "then , the density fluctuations on scales less than the free - streaming scale would be suppressed  @xcite .",
    "thus , the discrepancies between the observations of dm halos on sub - galactic scales and the predictions of the standard wimp dm picture could be resolved .",
    "recently , the atic @xcite and ppb - bets @xcite collaborations have reported measurements of the cosmic ray electron / positron spectrum at energies of up to @xmath4  tev .",
    "the data shows an obvious excess over the expected background for energies in the ranges @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively . at the same time",
    ", the pamela collaboration also released their first cosmic - ray measurements of the positron fraction @xcite and the @xmath7 ratio @xcite . the positron fraction (",
    "but not the antiproton to proton ratio ) shows a significant excess for energies above @xmath8 up to @xmath9 , compared to the background predicted by conventional cosmic - ray propagation models .",
    "this result is consistent with previous measurements by heat @xcite and ams @xcite .",
    "very recently , the fermi - lat collaboration has released data on the measurement of the electron spectrum from 20 gev to 1 tev @xcite , and the hess collaboration has published electron spectrum data from 340 gev to 700 gev @xcite , complementing their earlier measurements at 700 gev to 5 tev @xcite .",
    "the fermi - lat measured spectrum agrees with atic below 300 gev ; however , it does not exhibit the special features at large energy .",
    "there have already been some discussions on the implications for dm physics obtained by combining the fermi - lat , hess and pamela results  @xcite .",
    "the atic , ppb - bets and pamela results indicate the existence of a new source of primary electrons and positrons , while the hadronic processes are suppressed . it is well known that dm annihilation can be a possible origin for primary cosmic rays @xcite which could account for the atic , ppb - bets and pamela data simultaneously , as discussed first in @xcite and also in @xcite ( see @xcite for a list of references ) . however , the fact that the @xmath7 ratio does not show an excess gives strong constraints on dm models if they are to explain the data .",
    "in particular , it is very difficult to use well - known dm candidates like the neutralino to explain the atic and pamela data simultaneously  @xcite since they would also yield an excess of antiprotons . therefore , if the observed electron / positron or positron excesses indeed arise from dm annihilation , it seems to us that there may exist special connections between the dm sector and lepton physics  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a dm model and study its implications for dm detection .",
    "we fit our model to two different combinations of the experiment data : one set of data from the atic , ppb - bets and pamela experiments ; the other from the fermi - lat , hess , and pamela experiments .",
    "our results show that our model can naturally explain the @xmath10 excesses while at the same time solving the small scale problems of the standard @xmath11cdm model via non - thermal dm production . for a single majorana dm particle ,",
    "its annihilation cross section has @xmath12 wave suppression .",
    "thus , we consider two degenerate majorana dm particles . we add a new dm sector with a @xmath0 gauge symmetry and",
    "introduce an additional discrete symmetry to the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the dm particles are stable due to the discrete symmetry . during the @xmath0 gauge symmetry breaking phase transition a network of cosmic strings",
    "is generated .",
    "the decay of cosmic string loops is a channel for producing a non - thermal distribution of dm .",
    "this non - thermal distribution allows for dm masses and annihilation cross sections large enough to explain the cosmic ray anomalies while simultaneously remaining consistent with the observed dm energy density .",
    "in addition , the observed neutrino masses and mixings can be explained via the seesaw mechanism , and the baryon number asymmetry can be generated via non - thermal leptogenesis  @xcite .",
    "it has been recently recognized that a large annihilation cross section of dm particles into leptons to account for the cosmic ray anomalies will induce a large flux of @xmath1 rays from the galactic center ( gc )  @xcite or from the centers of dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "the predicted @xmath1 ray fluxes based on the nfw profile for the standard cdm scenario have been shown to be in slight conflict with the current observations of hess @xcite . however ,",
    "in our model the dm particles are produced non - thermally , so the high velocity of the dm particles will lower the phase space density of dm and lead to a dm profile with a constant density core @xcite .",
    "therefore our model with non - thermally produced dm on one hand gives rise to a large annihilation cross section to account for the positron / electron excess observed locally while on the other hand it suppresses the dm density at the gc and leads to a low flux of @xmath1 ray radiation .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we describe in detail the model and the production mechanism of the dm particles . in section iii",
    "we study aspects of the phenomenology of the model , including studies of some constraints on the model parameters from particle physics experiments , implications for the pamela , atic , ppb - bets , fermi - lat , and hess results , and also the @xmath1-ray radiation from the gc .",
    "section iv contains the discussion and conclusions .",
    "the dm model we propose consists of adding a new  dm sector \" to the standard model .",
    "the new particles have only leptonic charges and are uncharged under color .",
    "this ensures that the dm particles annihilate preferentially into leptons . to ensure the existence of a stable dm particle , the new sector is endowed with a discrete symmetry which plays a role similar to that of r - parity in supersymmetric models .",
    "the lightest particles which are odd under the @xmath13 symmetry which we introduce are the candidate dm particles .    in our convention , we denote the right - handed leptons and higgs doublet as @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively , where their @xmath16 quantum numbers are given in parenthesis .",
    "we consider the generalized standard model with an additional @xmath0 gauge symmetry broken at an intermediate scale .",
    "in particular , all the sm fermions and higgs fields are uncharged under this @xmath0 gauge symmetry . to break the @xmath0 gauge symmetry ,",
    "we introduce a sm singlet higgs field @xmath17 with @xmath0 charge @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , we introduce four sm singlet chiral fermions @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , a sm singlet scalar field @xmath23 and a sm doublet scalar field @xmath24 with @xmath16 quantum numbers @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath0 charges for @xmath27 and @xmath24 are @xmath28 , while the @xmath0 charges for @xmath29 and @xmath23 are @xmath30 .",
    "thus , our model is anomaly free . to have stable dm candidates , we introduce a @xmath31 symmetry . under this @xmath31 symmetry , only the particles @xmath27 and @xmath23 are odd while all the other particles are even .",
    "the @xmath32 particles will be the dm candidates , whereas the chiral fermions @xmath29 will play the role of right - handed neutrinos .",
    "the relevant part of the most general renormalizable lagrangian consistent with the new symmetries is @xmath33    as we will discuss in the following subsection , the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) for @xmath17 is around @xmath34 gev",
    ". then , the couplings @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 should be very small - about @xmath38 - in order for the model to be consistent with the expected value of the sm higgs .",
    "this fine - tuning problem could be solved naturally if we were to consider a supersymmetric model . moreover , in order to explain the recent cosmic ray data , the yukawa couplings @xmath39 should be around @xmath40 .",
    "this would generate a dm mass around 1 tev .",
    "such small yukawa couplings @xmath39 can be explained via the froggat - nielsen mechanism  @xcite which will not be studied here .    to explain the neutrino masses and mixings via the  seesaw mechanism \" , we require that the vev of @xmath24 be about 0.1 gev if @xmath41 and @xmath42 . in this case , the lightest active neutrino is massless since we only have two right - handed neutrinos @xmath29 .",
    "in addition , in our @xmath0 model , the higgs field forming the strings is also the higgs field which gives masses to the right - handed neutrinos .",
    "there are right - handed neutrinos trapped as transverse zero modes in the core of the strings . when cosmic string loops decay , they release these neutrinos .",
    "this is an out - of - equilibrium process .",
    "the released neutrinos acquire heavy majorana masses and decay into massless leptons and electroweak higgs particles to produce a lepton asymmetry , which is converted into a baryon number asymmetry via sphaleron transitions  @xcite .",
    "thus , we can explain the baryon number asymmetry via non - thermal leptogenesis .    in this paper , we consider two degenerate majorana dm candidates @xmath19 and @xmath20 since the annihilation cross section for a single majorana dm particle is too small to explain the recent cosmic ray experiments  @xcite . for simplicity , we assume that the lagrangian is invariant under @xmath43 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath44 to make sure that we have two degenerate majorana dm candidates @xmath19 and @xmath20 , we choose @xmath45 , and assume @xmath46 .",
    "we assume that the @xmath0 gauge symmetry is broken by the vev of the scalar field @xmath17 .",
    "to be specific , we take the potential of @xmath17 to be v(s ) = ( |s|^2 - ^2 ) ^2 , where @xmath47 is the self - interaction coupling constant .",
    "the vev of @xmath17 hence is @xmath48 with @xmath49 . due to",
    "finite temperature effects , the symmetry is unbroken at high temperatures . during the cooling of the very early universe , a symmetry breaking phase transition takes place at a temperature @xmath50 with t_c . during this phase transition ,",
    "inevitably a network of local cosmic strings will be formed .",
    "these strings are topologically non - trivial field configurations formed by the higgs field @xmath17 and the @xmath0 gauge field @xmath51 .",
    "the mass per unit length of the strings is given by @xmath52 .    during the phase transition , a network of strings forms , consisting of both infinite strings and cosmic string loops .",
    "after the transition , the infinite string network coarsens and more loops form from the intercommuting of infinite strings .",
    "cosmic string loops loose their energy by emitting gravitational radiation .",
    "when the radius of a loop becomes of the order of the string width @xmath53 , the loop releases its final energy into a burst of @xmath51 and @xmath17 particles .",
    "those particles subsequently decay into dm particles , with branching ratios @xmath54 and @xmath55 . for simplicity",
    "we assume that all the final string energy goes into @xmath51 particles .",
    "a single decaying cosmic string loop thus releases n 2 ^-1 dm particles which we take to have a monochromatic distribution with energy @xmath56 , the energy of an s - quantum in the broken phase . in our model , we assume that the masses for @xmath51 , @xmath17 and @xmath29 are roughly the same , so we have @xmath57 .    given the symmetry we have imposed , the number densities of @xmath19 and @xmath20 are equal .",
    "thus , the number density @xmath58 of dm particles , the sum of the number densities of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , is @xmath59    if the @xmath17 and @xmath51 quanta were in thermal equilibrium before the phase transition , then the string network is formed with a microscopic correlation length @xmath60 ( where @xmath61 is the time at which the phase transition takes place ) .",
    "the correlation length gives the mean curvature radius and mean separation of the strings .",
    "as discussed in @xcite ( see also the reviews @xcite ) , the initial correlation length is ( t_c ) ~ ^-1 ^-1 .",
    "after string formation , there is a time interval during which the dynamics of the strings is friction - dominated . in this period , the correlation length increases faster than the hubble radius because loop intercommutation is very efficient .",
    "as was discussed e.g. in @xcite , the correlation length scale @xmath62 in the friction epoch scales as @xmath63 the friction epoch continues until @xmath62 becomes comparable to the hubble radius @xmath64 .",
    "after this point , the string network follows a  scaling solution \" with @xmath65 .",
    "this scaling solution continues to the present time .",
    "the loss of energy from the network of long strings with correlation length @xmath62 is predominantly due to the production of cosmic string loops .",
    "the number density of cosmic string loops created per unit of time is given by @xcite : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a constant of order 1 .",
    "we are interested in loops decaying below the temperature @xmath68 when the dm particles fall out of thermal equilibrium ( loops decaying earlier will produce dm particles which simply thermalize ) .",
    "we denote the corresponding time by @xmath69 .    the dm number density released from @xmath69 till today",
    "is obtained by @xcite summing up the contributions of all decaying loops .",
    "each loop yields a number @xmath70 of dm particles .",
    "we track the loops decaying at some time @xmath64 in terms of the time @xmath71 when that loop was created .",
    "since the loop density decreases sharply as a function of time , it is the loops which decay right after @xmath69 which dominate the integral . for the values of @xmath72 which we are interested in",
    ", it turns out that loops decaying around @xmath69 were created in the friction epoch , and the loop number density is determined by inserting ( [ friction ] ) into ( [ prod ] ) . changing the integration variable from @xmath64 to @xmath62",
    ", we integrate the redshifted number density to obtain : @xmath73 where the subscript @xmath74 refers to parameters which are evaluated today . in the above ,",
    "@xmath75 where @xmath76 is the time at which cosmic string loops which are decaying at the time @xmath69 formed .    now the loop s time - averaged radius ( radius averaged over a period of oscillation ) shrinks at a rate @xcite = - _ loops g , where @xmath77 is a numerical factor @xmath78 .",
    "since loops form at time @xmath76 with an average radius r(t_f ) ^1/2 g^*^3/4 g m_pl^12 t_f^32 , where @xmath79 counts the number of massless degrees of freedom in the corresponding phase , they have shrunk to a point at the time t ^1/2 g^*^3/4 ^-1_loops m_pl^12 t_f^32 . thus t_f",
    "~ ^-1/3 g^*^-1/2 ^23_loops m_pl^-13 t_^23 .",
    "now the entropy density is s = 2 ^2 45 g _ * t^3 .",
    "the time @xmath64 and temperature @xmath80 are related by t = 0.3 g_*^-12(t ) m_plt^2 , where @xmath81 is the planck mass . thus using eqs .",
    "( [ friction ] ) and ( [ eq : no ] ) , we find that the dm number density today released by decaying cosmic string loops is given by @xmath82 where the subscript on @xmath83 refers to the time when @xmath83 is evaluated .    the dm relic abundance is related to @xmath84 by : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the hubble parameter in units of @xmath87 , @xmath88 is the dm mass , and @xmath89 .    to give some concrete numbers , we choose the parameter values @xmath57 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 . in our model",
    ", we have @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 .",
    "we define the dimensionless ratios @xmath98 demanding that we obtain a specific value of @xmath99 for the above choices of the parameter values will fix @xmath50 via ( [ eq : omega ] ) . for various values of @xmath100 and @xmath99 , we present the resulting @xmath50 values for the cases @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 , respectively , in table  [ model - i - ii ] . in short",

    "in this paper we have proposed a dm model and studied aspects of its phenomenology .",
    "we have shown that our model can simultaneously explain the cosmic ray anomalies recently measured by the atic , ppb - bets and pamela experiments or by the fermi - lat , hess and pamela experiments , resolve the small - scale structure problems of the standard @xmath11cdm paradigm , explain the observed neutrino mass hierarchies , explain the baryon number asymmetry via non - thermal leptogenesis and suppress the @xmath1 ray radiation from the gc .    in this model ,",
    "dm couples only to leptons . in direct detection experiments",
    "it would show as an `` electromagnetic '' event rather than a nuclear recoil .",
    "experiments that reject electromagnetic events would thus be ignoring the signal .",
    "however , in the fermi - lat / hess / pamela fits , the dm particle couples mainly to muons , and there being no muons in the target of direct detection experiments , no significant signal would be expected . in the atic / ppb - bets / pamela fit , the dm couples predominantly to electrons ; the electron recoil energy is of order @xmath105 ev , and it would be too small to be detectable in current devices .",
    "alternatively , this energy could cause fluorescence @xcite , albeit the fluorescence cross section would be prohibitively small",
    ". regarding the annual modulation signal observed by dama @xcite , although this experiment accepts all recoil signals , an estimate of the electron scattering cross section shows that the present model predicts a cross section which is about @xmath106 orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath107 required to account for the modulation @xcite .",
    "therefore we do not expect a signal in direct detection experiments if the dm model presented here is realized .",
    "in addition , the capture of dm particles in the sun or the earth is also impossible since the dm will not loose its kinetic energy when scattering with electrons in the sun",
    ". therefore we do not expect high energy neutrino signals from the sun or the earth either .",

    "<S> in this paper we propose a dark matter model and study aspects of its phenomenology . </S>",
    "<S> our model is based on a new dark matter sector with a @xmath0 gauge symmetry plus a discrete symmetry added to the standard model of particle physics . </S>",
    "<S> the new fields of the dark matter sector have no hadronic charges and couple only to leptons . </S>",
    "<S> our model can not only give rise to the observed neutrino mass hierarchy , but can also generate the baryon number asymmetry via non - thermal leptogenesis . </S>",
    "<S> the breaking of the new @xmath0 symmetry produces cosmic strings . </S>",
    "<S> the dark matter particles are produced non - thermally from cosmic string loop decay which allows one to obtain sufficiently large annihilation cross sections to explain the observed cosmic ray positron and electron fluxes recently measured by the pamela , atic , ppb - bets , fermi - lat , and hess experiments while maintaining the required overall dark matter energy density . </S>",
    "<S> the high velocity of the dark matter particles from cosmic string loop decay leads to a low phase space density and thus to a dark matter profile with a constant density core in contrast to what happens in a scenario with thermally produced cold dark matter where the density keeps rising towards the center . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the flux of @xmath1 rays radiated from the final leptonic states of dark matter annihilation from the galactic center is suppressed and satisfies the constraints from the hess @xmath1-ray observations . </S>"
