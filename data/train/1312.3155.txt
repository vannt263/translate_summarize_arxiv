    "carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) have been a subject of intense research since their discovery in 1992 and subsequent systematic synthesis by different growth techniques . @xcite these quasi 1d - systems exhibit interesting physical properties that makes them ideal building blocks for nanodevices with a variety of proposed optoelectronic and sensor functionalities . among the different properties of cnts ,",
    "electronic transport is of special interest , as different structural details of the nanotubes ( wrapping angle and diameter ) result in qualitatively different electronic characteristics , including metallic and semiconducting behavior .",
    "@xcite    the electronic properties of nanostructured devices are strongly influenced by the dielectric properties of the host material , and this is especially true of cnts .",
    "size and chirality dependence of the dielectric constant in cnts have been studied previously , and shown to result in different behavior , depending on the electronic character , size and the external electric field configuration applied on the nanotube.@xcite the zero frequency dielectric response of carbon nanotubes not only affects the charge carrier transport in nanoelectronics devices based on cnt , but can also be a tool to determine their interaction with adsorbed molecules and external fields .",
    "the different dielectric response of metallic and semiconducting cnts has been shown to be an essential ingredient in sorting cnts according to their electronic properties ( as related to the different polarizabilities ) , @xcite and to strongly affect the force microscope measurements on individual cnts.@xcite    interestingly , however , the effect of spin - orbit interactions ( sois ) has not been analyzed in the context of the polarizability of these structures .",
    "the existence of spin - orbit coupling in cnts has been theoretically studied in previous works , @xcite and observed in transport experiments to have sizable effects , @xcite including breaking the four - fold degeneracy and electron - hole symmetry induced by the coupling of the electron orbital and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "@xcite sois provide further fascinating opportunities in the design of qubits and novel spintronic devices .",
    "@xcite in this work we explore the consequences of soi on the polarizability of single walled cnts .",
    "the measure to which soi effects may be tunable via applied fields may provide in principle a useful manipulation scheme of the dielectric function of such nanoscale system .",
    "this approach may also yield additional controls on the optimization of this material for electronic devices .    to this end ,",
    "the aim of this paper is to present calculations of the longitudinal static polarizability of cnts in the long wavelength limit in the presence of soi .",
    "we consider soi contributions known as the _ intrinsic _ spin - orbit ( iso ) , @xcite as well as the _ rashba _ spin - orbit ( rso ) interactions .",
    "@xcite our results are analyzed for different nanotube chiralities , and as function of radius and soi parameters .",
    "as we will describe in detail , iso interactions induce the appearance or enhancement of an energy gap in the spectrum near the fermi level of undoped nanotubes ( for metallic or semiconductor tubes , respectively ) .",
    "this change is shown to be responsible for dramatic changes in the static polarizability , as the intrinsic character of the cnt is modified .",
    "in contrast , rso interactions tend to reduce the gap and produce electron - hole asymmetries in the spectrum , which also affect the dielectric response , opening the possibility of a tunable dielectric function for nanoelectronic device implementation , @xcite metallicity characterization , @xcite and molecular detection.@xcite effects of sois on the transport properties have also been studied recently .",
    "@xcite    in what follows , we describe the four - orbital tight - binding model used , and the effect of including spin - orbit couplings on the electronic band structure of different cnts .",
    "similarly , we present the random phase approximation ( rpa ) formalism used to calculate the dielectric function , and explore the dependence of the polarizability on soi parameters and cnt characteristics .",

    "@xcite nanotubes with @xmath2 are called _ armchair _ for their edge profile and have always metallic behavior ; those with @xmath3 have _ zigzag _ edges , and can be both metallic or semiconducting . as this classification follows the symmetries of flat graphene , it ignores effects of curvature and the concomitant orbital mixing that gives rise to sizable spin - orbit coupling of even the @xmath4-manifold .",
    "@xcite to model the carbon nanotube we use a four - orbital orthogonal tight - binding basis set , considering nearest neighbors hopping and include soi via two different terms in the hamiltonian @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the graphene - like ( no - soi ) hamiltonian , with appropriate boundary conditions .",

    "@xcite    the spin - orbit interactions on the hamiltonian are included only for the @xmath4-orbital subbands .",

    "in addition to the gap opening , we see splitting of the various levels due to the broken spin - degeneracy , resulting as well in a particle - hole asymmetric spectrum ; this behavior has been noted in previous work that includes both soi interactions . @xcite in fig .  [ 90so](d ) we consider both mechanisms , but with a stronger rashba parameter , @xmath88 .",
    "the larger @xmath39 emphasizes the competition taking place between both interactions : while iso opens a gap near the fermi level , the rso term tends to reduce it .",

    "as the rso interaction produces a spin splitting / mixing of the bands , it would be interesting to see whether this has consequences on the spin susceptibility or the screening of magnetic impurities .",

    ". it would be interesting to investigate whether this effect can be used to enhance the response to molecular adhesion selectivity or sensitivity .",
    "the results presented here may be useful in different applications : ( i ) in carbon nanotube separation processes , as the use of applied strong electric fields will intrinsically change the dielectric response ; ( ii ) in molecular detectors , as a molecule attached to the walls of a carbon nanotube is responsible for strong local and likely radial electric fields , hence inducing a rso - like interaction that can change the dielectric function ; ( iii ) in electric - field engineering of the dielectric response to provide desirable spin - dependent functionalities , including the possible polarization of current through cnts .",
