    "the problem of the origin of life and its early evolution is clearly one of the most fundamental problems of modern science . in spite of considerable efforts , even most basic questions in this multidisciplinary issue",
    "remain unanswered .",
    "the basic frame of most theories of the emergence of life was set many years ago by oparin  @xcite , who proposed that life emerged as a result of gradual evolution of nonorganic matter .",
    "oparin s ideas were to some extent verified by experiments done by miller and urey  @xcite , who showed that for a system of water and an atmosphere consisting of gases that were thought to be common on the pre - biological earth , electrical discharges resulted in the formation of some amino acids and nucleotides .",
    "it is believed that once created in sufficient concentrations , these molecules entered complicated synthetic reactions , which produced more and more complex molecules .",
    "some of these complex molecules had catalytic and presumably to some extent even autocatalytic properties  @xcite .",
    "the autocatalytic molecules ( or rather systems of them ) , if of sufficient stability , were clearly more likely to survive in a competition for reactants . the gradual evolution of such autocatalytic systems , subjected to darwinian selection , resulted in mastering their surviving skills and eventually led to the emergence of life .",
    "even though the above - sketched scenario might seem plausible , many of its important details are still unresolved  @xcite .",
    "the replicatory mechanism of contemporary living cells is very sophisticated and basically unchanged since the emergence of the first living cells , which presumably took place about 3.5 - 4 billion years ago .",
    "one of the characteristic features of this mechanism is that the tasks of coding and catalysis are being assigned to different macromolecules , namely to nucleic acids and proteins , respectively .",
    "moreover , the code , i.e. , the way amino acids are encoded by nucleotides , is universal for all living cells .",
    "it suggests an interesting possibility that all living cells are actually descendants of a single pra - cell , which happened to develop the most effective surviving skills .    at the same time",
    ", however , it raises some questions .",
    "one might expect that in search for the most effective cells nature tried many variants of different effectiveness .",
    "why did a certain code predominated all other variants ?",
    "was this variant really of such an enormous effectiveness or maybe predomination was somehow a generic feature of prebiotic dynamics ?",
    "one can notice , however , that in any contemporary ecosystem a large number of species coexist and these species are clearly of different effectiveness .",
    "nevertheless the invasion of an ecosystem by a single species is an unobservable phenomenon .",
    "although very much different , both contemporary ecosystems and primeval soup might be regarded as composed of certain individuals with some replicative properties .",
    "why thus did nature select the single - species solution at the early stages of life and why does it prefer multi - species solutions at later stages ?",
    "various aspects of the problem of the origin of life and biological evolution have been already modeled  @xcite .",
    "even though such models are , by necessity , highly simplified , they help us to understand the essence of these complex phenomena .",
    "for example , one can construct simple models of biological evolution which explain why the dynamics of extinction of species has some scale - invariant properties  @xcite .",
    "the problem of multiplicity of species in replicative systems has been also already addressed in the literature .",
    "a comprehensive review of bio - chemical aspects of this problem was written by orgel  @xcite and most recently by szathmry  @xcite .",
    "certain simple models of replicative systems have been also recently examined  @xcite .",
    "for example , in the model discussed by szathmry and maynard smith an ensemble of replicators is described in terms of differential equations . in particular ,",
    "the concentration of the @xmath0-th replicator is described by the following equation  @xcite : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the growth rate constant of the @xmath0-th replicator and @xmath3 is the order of replication .",
    "it turns out that asymptotic ( @xmath4 ) concentrations ( or rather their ratios ) depend on @xmath3 . for @xmath5 ( malthusian growth ) ,",
    "the replicator with the largest @xmath2 becomes dominant and such a case is characterized as survival of the fittest. for @xmath6 ( parabolic growth ) , the ratios of concentrations become finite , which is termed as survival of everybody. in the case @xmath7 ( hyperbolic growth ) , the dominant replicator is the one with the largest product of the initial concentration and the growth rate constant , which is termed as survival of the common. the interest in growth laws with @xmath8 is partially motivated experimentally , since it was shown that certain oligonucleotides , which presumably played an important role in prebiotic dynamics , indeed follow the growth law with @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "since such a growth implies survival of everybody , we are faced with a problem of the transition to the malthusian growth , which would explain survival of the fittest. however , recently it was shown by lifson and lifson that for more general growth laws than eq .",
    "( [ szat ] ) , the survival of the fittest takes place even in the @xmath6 case  @xcite .",
    "an important assumption underlying models leading to differential equations like eq .",
    "( [ szat ] ) is that replicators are perfect , i.e. , a replicator produces at a certain speed its exact copy . in our opinion , to model evolution at early stages we should rather consider a system of imperfect replicators , which , for example , would produce their copies only with a certain probability and otherwise they would mutate .    in the present paper , we examine two simple models of such systems . in our models , replicators , which might replicate or mutate , exist in infinitely many varieties  @xcite . as our main result",
    ", we show that behaviour of these models strongly depends on some details of dynamics of these models .",
    "namely , only in one of these models the evolution proceeds in a single - species way , i.e. , with the majority of the system descending from the same ancestor . in the second model ,",
    "such single - species states are very unstable and the system evolves through multi - species paths .",
    "in section ii we define our models and present their basic properties . in section iii",
    "we examine in more details the behaviour of each model , emphasizing the difference between single- and multi - species evolution .",
    "section iv contains our conclusions .",
    "let us consider a system composed initially of @xmath9 individuals . these individuals might be regarded as complex molecules at the prebiotic era immersed in the primeval soup and thus involved in a number of catalytic or autocatalytic reactions . with each individual",
    "we assign randomly the replication probability @xmath10 for @xmath11 that the @xmath0-th individual will exactly replicate itself in the course of reproduction .",
    "the dynamics of this model , which in the following will be referred to as model i , is specified as follows :    1 .",
    "choose an individual at random .",
    "the chosen individual is denoted by @xmath0 .",
    "2 .   with the probability @xmath12 the @xmath0-th individual dies .",
    "the constant @xmath13 might be regarded as a certain environmental capacity. namely , provided that initially we have @xmath14 , @xmath9 will never exceed @xmath15 .",
    "3 .   with the probability @xmath16 the @xmath0-th individual survives and produces a new individual @xmath17 .",
    "the probability @xmath18 assigned to the @xmath17-th individual is equal to @xmath19 ( parent s value ) with the probability @xmath19 and is equal to a random number from the interval ( 0,1 ) with the probability @xmath20 .",
    "this rule means that if a copying error happens , it dramatically changes the properties of the new individual .",
    "these rules imply that in the steady state the death rate @xmath21 equals to the reproduction rate @xmath22 and thus on average @xmath23 .",
    "as far as the number of individuals is concerned , model i is equivalent to a certain random walk problem .",
    "indeed , from the rules stated above one can infer the following equation for the probability @xmath24 that in our system there are @xmath9 individuals at time @xmath25 : @xmath26 this equation describes changes in our system after updating a single molecule . to conform to the monte carlo simulations presented later",
    ", we assume that such a single update takes @xmath27 of time ( i.e. , a unit of time corresponds to a single , on average , update of each individual ) .",
    "thus , in eq.([1 ] ) we have @xmath28 . introducing the variable @xmath29 ,",
    "we can rewrite eq.([1 ] ) as @xmath30 which is clearly the equation of a random walk with attraction toward @xmath31 , i.e. , @xmath32 .",
    "it has been already shown that the so - called dog - flea model is also equivalent to a similar random walk problem with attraction  @xcite and that fluctuations in this model around equilibrium ( @xmath31 ) become negligible in the limit , which in our case corresponds to @xmath33 .",
    "thus , we expect that in model i fluctuations of the number of individuals around @xmath32 are also small for large @xmath15 .",
    "to examine replicative properties of our model , we resort first to monte carlo simulations .",
    "since the implementation of the above rules on the computer is rather straightforward , we present only the results of these simulations . in fig.[f1 ] we present the time evolution of the average replication probability @xmath34 .",
    "simulations were done for @xmath35 and initially the probabilities @xmath36 were chosen at random . in all simulations reported in the present paper the initial number of individuals",
    "@xmath9 is equal to @xmath15 .",
    "one can clearly see that the average replication probability increases in time but the increase is very slow and it is not obvious what value is reached in the steady state ( i.e. , for @xmath37 ) .    however ,",
    "below we present some analytical calculations which show that if the limit @xmath38 is taken first , then for @xmath4 the average replication probability @xmath39 converges to unity .",
    "our strategy is to write the evolution equation for the higher order moments of replication probability and then to solve the resulting infinite set of equations in the steady state .",
    "first let us assume that the evolution in our model lasted long enough to equilibrate it with respect to the number of molecules @xmath9 .",
    "thus , we approximate the death and reproduction probabilities as @xmath40 . introducing the notation @xmath41 , where @xmath42 we can write the following evolution equation for the first moment of @xmath19 ( i.e. , for @xmath39 ) @xmath43 , \\label{3}\\ ] ] were we put @xmath44 as an average number of individuals .",
    "the first and second terms on the right - hand side of eq.([3 ] ) describe the changes due to a single update caused , respectively , by the death and reproduction processes .",
    "the term @xmath45 corresponds to production of an individual with a randomly assigned replication probability , which thus on average takes the value @xmath46 .",
    "we can write similar equations for arbitrary @xmath47 : @xmath48 , \\ \\",
    "{ \\rm for } \\",
    "l=1,2\\ldots \\ . \\label{4}\\",
    "] ] in eq.([4 ] ) we used the fact that the @xmath47-th moment of a random variable , which is uniformly distributed on ( 0,1 ) , is equal to @xmath49 . in the steady state ,",
    "the left - hand side of eq.([4 ] ) is zero and thus we obtain @xmath50 this infinite set of equations can be solved .",
    "namely , when we add the eqs.([5 ] ) for @xmath51 all higher - order moments cancel out and we obtain @xmath52 and thus @xmath53 , since both series diverge and differ only by unity .",
    "similarly , all other moments @xmath54 in the steady state are equal to one .",
    "thus we expect that in the limit @xmath4 the replicative probability @xmath39 in fig.[f1 ] increases to unity even though the convergence seems to be very slow .      before discussing other properties of model i ,",
    "let us consider the model where the probability of death of a certain individual depends not only on the total number of individuals ( as in model i ) but also on the individual itself .",
    "such a modification is motivated by the fact that in the primeval soup the survival of a molecule was determined not only by the access to substrates ( and then the total number of molecules is likely to determine the death rate ) but also by the stability of a given molecule against , e.g. , radiation , which clearly depends on the type of this molecule .",
    "thus , let us consider the model which in the following will be referred to as model ii . to each individual @xmath0 , in addition to the replication probability @xmath19 we assign randomly certain individual survival probability @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the dynamics of this model is specified as follows :    1 .",
    "choose an individual at random .",
    "the chosen individual is denoted by @xmath0 .",
    "2 .   with the probability @xmath12 the @xmath0-th individual dies due to the lack of reproductive substrates . 3 .",
    "provided that the individual survived the previous step : * it dies with the probability @xmath57 , * it survives with the probability @xmath55 and reproduces according to the rule analogous to that of model i. namely , the new individual with the probability @xmath19 has the same replication probability and death probability as its parent ( i.e. , @xmath19 and @xmath55 , respectively ) and with the probability @xmath20 these probabilities are chosen randomly anew",
    ".    for @xmath58 model ii becomes equivalent to model i. monte carlo simulations for model ii are also straightforward and we present only the results . in fig.[f1 ] we present the average replication probability @xmath39 defined in the same way as for model i. one can see that the convergence to unity is in this model much faster than in model i.",
    "but there are more important differences between these models than the rate of convergence .",
    "certain indication of different behaviour is seen in fig.[f2 ] , where we plot @xmath59 as a function of time in a logarithmic scale .",
    "one can see that the late - time evolution of model ii proceeds in steps between which the system basically remains at the same level of @xmath39 and none indication of such a stepwise behaviour is seen for model i. this stepwise behaviour suggests that model ii remains mostly in a single - species state with majority of individuals belonging to the same species .",
    "individuals @xmath0 and @xmath17 belong to the same species if @xmath60 and @xmath61 ; for model i the second condition is always satisfied .    to confirm such a scenario we present in fig.[snap ] snapshot configurations for models i and ii after 5000 monte carlo steps and @xmath62 . indeed , after this simulation time model ii was brought to a single - species state with only few individuals of @xmath63 ( they are not shown in fig.[snap ] since they all have @xmath64 ) . on the other hand , model",
    "i still remains in the multi - species state .",
    "we would like to point out that , of course , for finite @xmath15 there exists a finite probability that model i can be brought into a single - species state ( and for small @xmath15 one can indeed see such a behaviour in simulations ) but for large @xmath15 ( @xmath65 ) this would require an extremely long simulation time .",
    "what is , however , more important is that for model i single - species states are relatively unstable and this model mostly remains in multi - species state .",
    "such a behaviour is clearly seen in fig.[domin ] , where we show the time evolution of the percentage @xmath66 of individuals belonging to a dominant species in the system . as an initial configuration",
    "we have chosen a single - species state with prescribed values of replication and death probabilities , namely we set @xmath67 , where @xmath68 or @xmath69 for @xmath70 ( for model i , @xmath71 independently on @xmath72 ) .",
    "one can see that model i indeed quickly abandons the single - species state .",
    "we have checked that also for a larger @xmath72 the behaviour of model i is basically the same and the model quickly evolves toward the multi - species state .",
    "evolution of model ii is different .",
    "when prepared in a state of large @xmath72 ( e.g. , 0.99 ) , the model remains in this state for very long time .",
    "even when @xmath72 is smaller ( e.g. , 0.9 ) , this model , after some short transient , ends up in a single - species state .",
    "further evolution of model ii consists of small fluctuations within such a state , which sometimes might be strong enough to bring the system , again via some short transient , to another single - species state and usually with larger replication and survival probabilities .",
    "such a scenario is also confirmed in figs.[fdod1]-[fdod3 ] .",
    "we simulated the system of the size @xmath73 and with random initial probabilities @xmath19 and @xmath55 . in fig.[fdod1 ] , which shows the occupation of dominant species @xmath66",
    ", one can see that model i has rather irregular behaviour .",
    "sometimes a dominant species occupies a great majority of the system ( @xmath74 ) but sometimes it is only a small fraction of the system .",
    "the behaviour of model ii is different ( fig.[fdod2 ] ) .",
    "the dominant species almost always occupies most of the system . only during very rare and short - lived fluctuations ,",
    "@xmath66 becomes substantially smaller than unity . in fig.[fdod3 ] we show the replication probability of the dominant species for the monte carlo runs shown in fig.[fdod1 ] and fig.[fdod2 ] .",
    "one can see that in model ii , contrary to model i , the dominant species are very longed - lived .",
    "a comparison of fig.[fdod3 ] with fig.[fdod1 ] shows that even when the dominant species is unchanged , the percentage @xmath66 occupied by it might fluctuate wildly .",
    "we have examined two very simple models of systems of replicative individuals . although both models seem to evolve toward the state of perfect replicability , their evolution is markedly different . for model",
    "ii evolution proceeds through a sequence of consecutive transitions , between which the system remains basically in a single - species state ( i.e , with almost all individuals being identical ) . in our opinion",
    ", this model might describe prebiotic evolution until the invention of the universal code . according to this model ,",
    "when the relatively stable and almost error - free replicative mechanism was found , it quickly invaded the whole system . on the other hand , model i during its evolution remains mostly in a multi - species state .",
    "such a multi - species structure resembles modern ecosystems , where a large number of species coexist and are constantly struggling for survival .",
    "finally , let us notice that although the evolution of a system as a whole seems to proceed slower in model i than in model ii ( fig.[f1 ] ) , there are some species in model i with replicative probabilities very close to unity ( fig.[snap ] , fig.[fdod3 ] ) .",
    "thus , multi - species dynamics in model i enhances nucleation of species of very high effectiveness",
    ". however , even they are unlikely to reign for a long time ."
