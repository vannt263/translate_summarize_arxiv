    "it recently has been shown @xcite  that ( _ n_,@xmath14 ) cross - section measurements can be very useful for improving calculated astrophysical rates for reactions involving @xmath14 particles .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown @xcite  that resonance analyses of such data can be even more useful in improving these rates .",
    "this is because a resonance analysis can eliminate confounding uncertainties and therefore allow more direct tests of parameters of nuclear models ra2001,de2002,ra2003a  used to calculate these rates . however , to obtain the most useful information from a resonance analysis , it is necessary to know the spins of the resonances .",
    "this can be a problem because most of the nuclides for which ( _ n_,@xmath14 ) cross sections are measurable at resonance energies have non - zero ground - state spins ; hence , two spins are allowed even for low - energy _",
    "s_-wave resonances and it can be difficult or impossible to determine resonance spins using common techniques .",
    "information contained in the @xmath3-ray cascades following neutron capture reactions can , in principle , sometimes be used to determine resonance spins .",
    "for example , in some cases it is expected that the average number of @xmath3 rays in the de - excitation cascades between the capturing states and the ground state will be different for the two _ s_-wave spins .",
    "consider the case of @xmath1sm@xmath20 . because the ground - state spin of @xmath1sm is @xmath21 , _",
    "s_-wave neutrons lead to @xmath22 and @xmath23 resonances in @xmath24sm . in a very simple model in which only dipole transitions can occur ,",
    "at least three @xmath3-ray transitions are required to reach the @xmath25 ground state from a @xmath26 excited state whereas a minimum of four transitions are required in the case of a @xmath23 state .",
    "hence , in this very simple model , @xmath26 resonances will have an average multiplicity of three and @xmath23 resonances an average multiplicity of four .",
    "in reality , the existence of other multipolarities will both broaden the multiplicity distributions as well as decrease the difference between average multiplicities for @xmath26 and @xmath23 resonances co68,co2004 .",
    "detector effects also can cause changes in the measured multiplicity distributions .",
    "however , as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite the remaining @xmath27 difference in average multiplicity for the two spins still is measurable and independent of resonance energy and was used to determine spins of 91 @xmath1sm@xmath20  resonances below 900 ev .",
    "more recently @xcite , an algorithm that combined monte carlo @xmath3-ray cascades predicted by the nuclear statistical model with a monte carlo particle transport code was used to demonstrate that the predicted and measured multiplicity distributions for a multi - element nai detector were in agreement for @xmath26 and @xmath23 resonances in @xmath28sm@xmath20 .",
    "a similar technique was used to demonstrate good agreement between the measured and predicted multiplicity spectra for a multi - element baf@xmath29 detector re2002 .    the spin assignments from ref .",
    "@xcite  were used in ref.@xcite in an @xmath30-matrix analysis of the @xmath31 data of ref .",
    "@xcite to determine @xmath14 widths for 104 resonances below 700 ev .",
    "the resulting @xmath32 values revealed some surprises with respect to theoretical expectations .",
    "first , the @xmath14-width distributions for both @xmath26 and @xmath23 resonances did not follow the expected @xmath18 distributions .",
    "in particular , the @xmath14-width distributions were broader than reduced - neutron - width distributions instead of being intermediate to the distributions for neutrons and @xmath3 rays .",
    "second , the ratio of @xmath14 strength functions for @xmath26 to @xmath23 resonances was less than @xmath33one half of that predicted by theory . furthermore , exploratory calculations were not able to find an @xmath34nucleus potential that could reproduce the observed @xmath14 strength functions as well as the strength function ratio . trying to reduce the @xmath35 strength function ratio to the observed value quickly led to strength functions which were orders of magnitude larger than measured .",
    "most surprisingly , the data indicated that there is an abrupt decrease in the @xmath35 strength function ratio for energies above about 300 ev .",
    "such an abrupt change can not be reproduced with any optical model of @xmath14 strength functions .    as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath14-width distributions as well as the striking decrease in the @xmath36 ratio near 300 ev depend on accurate spin assignments for the resonances , especially above 300 ev . of the 104 resonances fitted in ref .",
    "@xcite , 23 resonances ( 5 below 300 ev ) had tentative spin assignments .",
    "therefore , we decided to make a new measurement of these resonance spins .",
    "it was expected that the new detector for advanced neutron capture experiments ( dance ) at the los alamos neutron science center ( lansce ) would make it possible to improve upon the measurement of ref .",
    "@xcite for several reasons .",
    "first , the flux at lansce is several orders of magnitude higher , allowing higher precision measurements even using smaller samples .",
    "second , the dance detector has many more detector segments and a more sophisticated data acquisition system making more reliable multiplicity measurements possible .",
    "third , the dance detector is made of baf@xmath29 rather than nai as used in ref .",
    "this change should lead to reduced backgrounds and improved timing .",
    "the experiment was performed using dance on flight path 14 at the manuel lujan , jr .",
    "neutron scattering center ( mlnsc ) at lansce @xcite .",
    "dance is a 4@xmath37 array of 160 baf@xmath29 crystals positioned 20 m from the neutron production target .",
    "details of the apparatus @xcite  and data acquisition @xcite have been published elsewhere , so only the salient features will be given herein .",
    "neutrons are generated at lansce via spallation reactions when an 800-mev proton beam strikes a tungsten target .",
    "the average proton current on target was 110 - 120 @xmath38a and the width of the proton pulses was 125 ns .",
    "flight path 14 views one of the ambient - temperature water moderators at the mlnsc .",
    "the resulting neutron flux peaks near thermal energy and is approximately proportional to @xmath39/@xmath40 over the range of our measurements .",
    "the samples were placed inside an evacuated flight tube which was surrounded by a @xmath41lih neutron - scattering shield at the center of the dance array .",
    "three samples of metallic samarium , which were enriched to 97.93% in @xmath42sm , 1 cm in diameter , and weighed 1.444 , 3.208 , and 10.410 mg , respectively were used .",
    "the samples were held in the neutron beam by attaching them to thin al foils .",
    "sample - out ( blank al backing foil ) and neutron - scattering ( c sample ) background measurements also were made under the same conditions .",
    "the neutron flux was monitored using three different sample / detector combinations downstream of the main sample position : i ) a bf@xmath43 detector , ii ) a fission chamber containing a @xmath44u sample , and iii ) solid state surface - barrier detectors which recorded tritons and @xmath14 particles from the @xmath41li(@xmath45,@xmath14)@xmath46h reaction occurring in a @xmath41lif sample .",
    "data were acquired as waveforms , using separate acqiris transient digitizers for each detector , over a period of 200 to 250 @xmath38s , triggered by a timing signal from the accelerator indicating the arrival of a proton pulse at the neutron production target .",
    "three sets of runs , each with a different delay for this trigger , were required to cover the entire range from 10 @xmath47s before each beam pulse from lansce to just below the lowest energy resonance at 3.397 ev .",
    "the waveforms were analyzed in real time to detect peaks .",
    "for each peak , a summary of the peak shape , together with a high resolution time stamp was written to a disk file .",
    "these data were sorted by a replay routine which generated information such as pulse - height ( @xmath3-ray energy ) , time - of - flight ( neutron energy ) , and cluster multiplicity ( number of @xmath3 rays detected ) for each event . as explained in the references ,",
    "cuts were applied to the data to reduce background from radioactive impurities in the baf@xmath29 crystals .",
    "in addition , an overall pulse - height cut on the total @xmath3-ray energy , @xmath48 mev , was used to restrict events to those in the range expected from @xmath1sm(@xmath49,@xmath3 ) reactions .",
    "this stage of the analysis resulted in a two - dimensional spectrum , time - of - flight versus multiplicity , for each of the runs .",
    "the average fluxes recorded by the flux monitors were used to normalize sample - out runs for background subtraction .",
    "[ 2dfig ] shows representative sample - in , sample - out , and subtracted two - dimensional spectra .",
    "projections of the background subtracted spectrum onto the multiplicity axis for two time - of - flight regions corresponding to resonances having previous firm spin assignments are shown in fig .",
    "[ multprojfig ] .",
    "these projections verify that there is a measurable , significant difference in the average multiplicity for the two different _",
    "s_-wave resonance spins . in principle , such projections at each time of flight ( or over each resonance ) could be used to determine the average multiplicities and hence the spins of the resonances as was done in ref .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ avemvse ] where the average multiplicity as a function of neutron energy is plotted for four energy regions . for this figure ,",
    "the average multiplicity is defined by :    @xmath50    where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the multiplicity and ( background - subtracted ) total yield for that multiplicity , respectively , at neutron energy @xmath53 .",
    "multiplicities one and greater than nine were not used because the statistical precision was too poor for these cases . as shown in the top two panels of fig .",
    "[ avemvse ] , at low energies where most of the resonances are well resolved , average multiplicities fall into two bands at @xmath54 and @xmath55 for @xmath9 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "however , worsening resolution with increasing neutron energy limits the usefulness of this approach , and , as shown in the bottom two panels of fig .",
    "[ avemvse ] , once the resonances are no longer adequately resolved from one another it becomes difficult or impossible to assign spins using this technique .",
    "the problem is that as instrumental resolution smears the peaks together , the multiplicity distribution at each neutron energy contains contributions from more than one resonance .",
    "if these resonances have different @xmath0 values , application of eq .",
    "[ average multiplicity equation ] will result in an @xmath57 value between the values for the two different spins .",
    "for example , the resonances at @xcite 418.3 , 625.3 , and 651.9 ev all have @xmath57 values about midway between the expected values for @xmath9 and @xmath56 . in such cases ,",
    "the average multiplicity often will display a positive or negative slope as a function of neutron energy and , if there is sufficient statistical precision and there are no other partially - resolved resonances nearby , it may be possible to discern that the peak in the yield curve actually is due to two resonances with different spins .",
    "for example , the peak near 65 ev was identified @xcite as a doublet , with the lower - energy resonance having @xmath58 and the upper one @xmath59 , using this technique . on the other hand , although the @xmath57 versus @xmath40 curve displays a slope at the 418.3- , 625.3- , and 651.9-ev resonances , it was not possible to assign firm spins , or to determine if they were doublets , in any of these cases due to partially - resolved @xmath9 and @xmath56 resonances on either side .",
    "another problem with using @xmath57 to assign spins is that , because it involves division by the background - subtracted counts , @xmath57 is very noisy between resonances and near very small resonances where there are few counts . for this reason",
    ", @xmath57 is plotted only near the peaks of the resonances in fig .",
    "[ avemvse ] .    to overcome these difficulties",
    ", we employed a technique which effectively uses not only the average multiplicity but also the shapes of the distributions , and does not require division by the yield .",
    "this technique involves effectively subtracting the prototypical multiplicity distribution for @xmath9 ( @xmath59 ) resonances from the multiplicity distribution at each neutron energy , thereby generating a curve as a function of neutron energy which peaks only at @xmath59 ( @xmath9 ) resonances .    to understand how this technique works ,",
    "consider that the total yield @xmath60 for a given multiplicity @xmath51 at neutron energy @xmath53 has , in general , contributions due to both @xmath9 and @xmath56 resonances ;    @xmath61    assuming that the average multiplicities as well as the shapes of the multiplicity distributions both remain constant for each of the two spins ( which we have verified for isolated resonances in our data ) , it is possible to find a residual yield @xmath62 that will be zero for all @xmath9 resonances ;    @xmath63    where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are integers , and @xmath66 is a normalization constant .",
    "for example , if @xmath67 and the distribution is symmetric , then eq . [ residual yield ] is satisfied for @xmath68 respectively , and @xmath69 . on the other hand , application of eq .",
    "[ residual yield ] to a @xmath59 resonance will yield a positive residual because @xmath57 is greater for @xmath59 resonances than it is for @xmath9 .",
    "these facts are graphically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ multcomboillus ] .",
    "furthermore , application of eq .",
    "[ residual yield ] to the data at energies where the yields contain contributions from both spins ( i.e. , eq .",
    "[ total yield ] ) will recover the @xmath59 component :    @xmath70-n_{1}\\sum% \\limits_{i = c}^{d}[y_{i}^{(3)}(e)+y_{i}^{(4)}(e ) ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\sum\\limits_{i = a}^{b}y_{i}^{(3)}(e)-n_{1}\\sum% \\limits_{i = c}^{d}y_{i}^{(3)}(e)+\\sum\\limits_{i = a}^{b}y_{i}^{(4)}(e)-n_{1}% \\sum\\limits_{i = c}^{d}y_{i}^{(4)}(e )   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\sum\\limits_{i = a}^{b}y_{i}^{(4)}(e)-n_{1}\\sum% \\limits_{i = c}^{d}y_{i}^{(4)}(e ) ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where , in the last step , eq . [ residual yield ] was used to eliminate the first two terms in the third line .",
    "similarly , a second residual yield @xmath71 can be found that will be zero for all @xmath59 resonances ;    @xmath72    because @xmath57 was between @xmath56 and @xmath73 for both spins , the summation limits in equations [ residual yield ] and [ residual yield 2 ] were chosen so that one sum ended at @xmath74 while the second began at @xmath75 .",
    "normalizations @xmath76 and @xmath77 were determined empirically to yield zero net counts in the vicinity of @xmath9 and @xmath56 resonances , respectively while yielding net positive counts for resonances of the other spin .",
    "the actual equations used are given in equations [ j=3 equation ] and [ j=4 equation ] .",
    "curves resulting from these equations are shown over the same energy regions as in fig .",
    "[ avemvse ] , in fig .",
    "[ multcombos ] , where the curve labeled @xmath9 was calculated according to :    @xmath78/1.3 .",
    "\\label{j=3 equation}\\ ] ]    similarly , the curve labeled @xmath59 was calculated using the formula :    @xmath79    . in contrast , resonances at 179.7 , 184.1 , 221.65 , and 225.28 ev have significantly lower average multiplicities of about 4.2 and hence @xmath9 .",
    "however , average multiplicities become less usefull when resonances are not well resolved . for example , the resonances at 418.3 , 625.3 , and 651.9 are only partly resolved from resonances on either side of them and have average multiplicities half way between the expected values for the two spin states . as a result , it is not possible to determine the spins of these resonances using only their average multiplicities .",
    "this situation becomes worse at higher energies.,width=264 ]    .",
    "for the purposes of this illustration , it is assumed that multiplicity is a continuous variable and that multiplicity distributions are symmetric about their means .",
    "two multiplicity distributions with mean values of @xmath80 and @xmath55 , respectively , are shown .",
    "the left and right hatched areas in each panel represent the two terms in equation [ residual yield ] for the two different multiplicity distributions .",
    "integration limits have been chosen so that they extend for equal ranges of multiplicity on either side of @xmath81 . under these conditions ,",
    "the vertically - hatched and diagonally - hatched areas in the top panel are equal and hence their difference is zero . however , as shown in the bottom panel , when these same integration limits are applied to the @xmath67 distribution , the horizontally - hatched area is larger than the cross - hatched area . hence , subtraction of the latter from the former yields a net positive result.,width=264 ]     which accentuates @xmath9 resonances .",
    "similarly , the blue dashed curves were calculated using eq .",

    "these two components are of course undetected in the total yield .",
    "vertical dashed lines in both the top and bottom panels indicate the position of the previously identified resonance position .",
    "the bottom panel shows the results of using measured multiplicity information .",
    "the fitted multiplicity distributions from fig .",
    "[ multprojfig ] were used together with the individual @xmath9 and @xmath56 yields in the top panel to calculate the curves and points in the bottom panel .",
    "the solid black circles represent average multiplicities @xmath57 ( right y axis ) calculated using equation [ average multiplicity equation ] .",
    "the average multiplicity is about midway between values expected for the two spins and displays a slight positive slope .",
    "these facts hint that this resonance might be a doublet .",
    "however , as shown in figs [ avemvse ] and [ multcombos ] , in the actual data this slope may be due to the fact that there is a partially resolved @xmath9 resonance just below and a @xmath59 resonance just above this energy .",
    "hence , it is not possible to draw any firm conclusions based on @xmath57 .",
    "the solid red and dashed blue curves in the bottom panel depict the residual yields ( left y axis ) calculated using equations [ j=3 equation ] and [ j=4 equation ] , which reveal both the spins and energies of the individual components of the doublet.,width=264 ]    the overall normalization constant in eq .",
    "[ j=3 equation ] was chosen to yield peaks of approximately the same height from both equations so that the results could more easily be compared to one another on the same graph .",
    "multiplicities one and greater than nine were not used because the statistical precision was too poor for these cases . the fact that the spin assignments for isolated resonances from this technique agree with those from using just the average multiplicities ( both from this work as well as from ref .",
    "@xcite ) indicates that the multiplicity distributions do remain reasonably constant .",
    "the main advantage of this technique is that it makes spin assignments possible for several un- and partially - resolved resonances for which using @xmath57 failed .",
    "for example , as discussed above , it was not possible to make firm spin assignments for the 418.3- , 625.3- , and 651.9-ev resonances using @xmath57 .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ multcombos ] , the peak in the yield curve at 418.3 ev , which previously had been given a tentative @xmath82 assignment , is clearly due to two resonances with the lower - energy one having @xmath9 and the other @xmath59 .",
    "[ jlcillus ] depicts simulations based on this doublet in an attempt to further illustrate this new technique .",
    "in addition , fig .",
    "[ multcombos ] shows that the 625.3- , and 651.9-ev resonances have @xmath9 .",
    "there were many other similar cases .",
    "overall , of the 140 resonances below @xmath4 kev , we were able to make firm @xmath0 assignments for 33 resonances with no previous @xmath0 assignments and eight firm @xmath0 assignments where previously there were only tentative assignments @xcite .",
    "curves calculated using equations [ j=3 equation ]  and [ j=4 equation ] were used to assign the resonance @xmath0 values up to @xmath4 kev listed in tables [ restable ] .",
    "we stopped at this energy because statistical analysis indicated that a significant fraction of resonances were beginning to be missed because of worsening resolution and statistical precision .",
    "spins from previous measurements also are given in table [ restable ] .",
    "only 14 resonances below @xmath4 kev ( nine below 700 ev ) remain without firm @xmath0 assignments .",

    "although the data in the @xmath130 ev region are in better agreement with larger @xmath94 values , intermediate degrees of freedom ( e.g. , @xmath165 and @xmath166 , for @xmath167 ) can not be excluded .",
    "taken together , both the maximum likelihood and ks methods indicate the shape of the @xmath17 distribution changes from pt to @xmath19 at @xmath168 ev .",
    "results from ks tests of the various distributions are summarized in table [ ksteststable ] .    in doing the above tests , we have calculated the correction for missed resonances using the data in the @xmath169 ev region , and assumed the same number of resonances ( @xmath141 ) in the @xmath16 ev region . although it could be argued that it might be better to use the data in the @xmath130 ev region to obtain the corrected number of resonances in this region , there are at least three reasons why our approach is better .",
    "first , as shown in fig .",
    "[ gn0vse ] , sensitivity to small resonances is greatest at lower energies .",
    "hence by using the data in the @xmath169 ev region , the correction factor is , in principle , smaller and any unknown systematic errors should be less important .",
    "second , all such correction methods must assume a neutron - width distribution .",
    "as discussed above , applying statistical tests to the data in the @xmath169 ev region indicate that these data are in good agreement with a pt distribution .",
    "hence , it should be safe to apply the method of ref .",
    "@xcite ( which assume a pt  distribution ) to the data in this region to obtain the corrected number of resonances . on the other hand , these same statistical tests indicate that the data in the @xmath16 ev region do not follow a pt  distribution , so it may not be valid to apply the technique of ref .",
    "@xcite to obtain the corrected number of resonances in this region from these data ; furthermore , to do so would result in a somewhat circular test ( i.e. , assuming @xmath93 to obtain the corrected number of resonances with which to test if @xmath93 ) .",
    "third , all such correction techniques are multiplicative in nature ; they obtain the corrected number of resonances by multiplying the observed number of resonances by a correction factor therefore , a significant systematic error can result if the wrong neutron - width distribution is assumed . this is because there are fewer resonances having small neutron widths for a @xmath170 distribution than for a pt one .",
    "therefore , for a given threshold such as shown in fig .",
    "gn0vse , fewer resonance will be missed for a @xmath170 distribution than for a pt one . hence ,",
    "if a pt distribution is assumed , but the distribution actually has @xmath170 , the resultant corrected number of resonances will be too large . to illustrate this point , we adapted the technique of ref .",
    "@xcite to a @xmath171 distribution . applying the technique of ref .",
    "fu65 ( with @xmath138 ) to the data in the @xmath16 ev region , assuming @xmath93 results in a corrected average level spacing of @xmath172 ev , which is @xmath173 standard deviations @xcite different from the corrected value ( @xmath174 ev ) in the @xmath169 ev region .",
    "in contrast , applying this same technique to these same data , but assuming @xmath175 results in a corrected average level spacing of @xmath176 ev ( @xmath177 ) , only 1.2 standard deviations from the result obtained for the @xmath169 ev region . hence , these calculations indicate the approach we have taken is reasonable , and further indicate that the @xmath17 data in the @xmath16 ev region are inconsistent with a pt distribution .    as a further check on the correction for missed resonances",
    ", we applied the technique of ref .",
    "@xcite , which is based on the @xmath12 statistic .",
    "the present case is very similar to the @xmath44u example discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , from which it can be calculated that most likely @xmath178 @xmath1sm+@xmath45 resonances were missed for each spin state for @xmath179",
    "ev . hence , the corrected number of resonances for @xmath149 ev from this technique is smaller than , but consistent with , the value obtained above following the technique of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one problem with using the ks test is that it is nonparametric , but we have determined parameters of the theoretical distribution from the data . in such cases , ref .",
    "@xcite indicates that the ks test is conservative , and refs .",
    "@xcite describe how to modify the ks test to make it parametric : the test statistic remains unchanged , but different tables of critical values are used , and these values are calculated using monte carlo techniques .    it is straightforward to adapt the ks test when @xmath180 is determined from the data .",
    "we wrote a computer program which drew @xmath111 ( where @xmath181 in the present case because this was the number of observed resonances in the @xmath121-ev region ) random @xmath17 values from a pt distribution .",
    "the average reduced neutron width for this sampled set then was calculated , and the maximum vertical difference ( the @xmath155 statistic ) between a pt distribution with this @xmath180 and the random samples was calculated .",
    "the program performed this task 30000 times to construct a distribution of @xmath155 values . as a check of the program , a second set of @xmath155 values",
    "was obtained in the standard ks sense ( without calculating @xmath180 from the sampled data ) .",
    "the @xmath159 values calculated using these standard @xmath155 values were found to agree with those in references ( e.g. , ref .",
    "furthermore , it was found that there were fewer large values of the @xmath155 statistic when @xmath182 was determined from the sampled data compared to the standard ks values , verifying that the ks test is conservative .",
    "for example , in the present case for a pt distribution having @xmath146 , the @xmath155 value calculated from the data was 0.2432 ( in the @xmath121-ev region ) , and the @xmath159 value increased from @xmath183 for the ks test to @xmath184 for this parametric variation .",
    "adapting the ks test to the case where @xmath111 also is determined from the data requires additional assumptions .",
    "we assumed that the resonances were spaced according to a wigner distribution and that the method of ref .",
    "@xcite can be used to correct for missed resonances .",
    "hence , for the @xmath121-ev region , we assumed a starting value of @xmath185 ev ( @xmath186 ) , and randomly sampled level spacings from this wigner distribution to obtain @xmath187 resonance energies between @xmath188 and @xmath189 ev .",
    "we then used random sampling to obtain a set of @xmath190 reduced neutron widths from a pt distribution .",
    "we then applied the same threshold curve determined from the data to remove those @xmath17 values which were below threshold , resulting in @xmath191 resonances with averaged reduced neutron width @xmath192 .",
    "subsequently , the method of ref .",
    "@xcite was used to obtain corrected @xmath193 and @xmath194 values .",
    "the pt distribution with these corrected parameters was compared to the sampled data to obtain the @xmath155 value for this sample .",
    "reduced neutron widths below the maximum threshold for the correction technique of ref .",
    "fu65 were excluded from this calculation .",
    "this procedure was repeated 30000 times to construct the distribution of @xmath155 values .",
    "these calculations revealed that when both @xmath111 and @xmath180 are determined from the data , there are even fewer large @xmath155 values than in either the standard ks case or the case where @xmath180 alone is determined from the data .",
    "for example , if a pt distribution having @xmath186 is compared to the data in the @xmath121-ev region , @xmath195 is obtained , for which the standard ks test yields @xmath196 .",
    "in contrast , this second modified ks test yields @xmath197 in this case .",
    "in addition to demonstrating that the data in the @xmath121-ev region are inconsistent with a pt  distribution to high confidence , the above tests also illustrate that this conclusion is unaltered by assuming , within reason , a higher threshold @xmath17 value or more missing resonances ( than applying the method of ref .",
    "@xcite to the data for @xmath198 ev yields ) .",
    "for example , the final version of the `` parametric '' ks test described above assumes that 10 more resonances were missed ( 17 versus 7 ) in the @xmath121-ev region .",
    "we have employed the same published techniques that have been used to demonstrate the validity of the pt distribution for reduced neutron widths to show that the pt distribution is inconsistent with the current data for @xmath130 ev to high confidence .",
    "this conclusion is in contrast with ref .",
    "@xcite where it was found that the reduced neutron width distributions agreed fairly well with pt distributions .",
    "however , our new dance data show that many of the spin assignments used in ref .",
    "@xcite as well as the relative number of @xmath9 to @xmath59 resonances assumed ( according to @xmath125 ) in that reference were incorrect .",
    "similar deviations from a pt distribution have been reported for @xmath199th @xcite , as well as for five odd - a nuclides ( @xmath200sm , @xmath201dy , @xmath202er , @xmath203lu , and @xmath204hf ) @xcite for which the @xmath12 statistic indicated that very few resonances had been missed .",
    "it is interesting to note that the reduced - neutron - width distribution for @xmath205th changes shape in a manner similar to what we have found for @xmath206sm ; from having @xmath19 for one energy range ( @xmath207 ev ) @xcite , to being consistent with pt for another energy range ( @xmath208 ev ) @xcite .",
    "it also is interesting to note that the deviation from a pt distribution for @xmath1sm occurs at the same energy where an anomaly in the @xmath14 strength function ratio has been reported @xcite .",
    "finally , it may be noteworthy that all seven of the reported deviations from pt discussed above are limited to relatively low energies , @xmath209 ev and nuclides in which deformation may be important .",
    "perhaps all these effects can be explained by the same theory .    in the early days of neutron",
    "width measurements , an exponential distribution ( @xmath102 ) seemed to be favored @xcite for the reduced neutron widths .",
    "subsequently it was shown @xcite , however , that a pt distribution fitted the data better .",
    "in addition to fitting the data better , plausible arguments were put forward to explain why the underlying physics should lead to a pt distribution . the assumptions that expansion coefficients of the compound nuclear wave function follow a gaussian distribution with zero mean , that these coefficients are real ( because , due to time - reversal invariance",
    ", the reduced width amplitudes have been shown to be real wi47 ) , and that neutron scattering is a single - channel process at these energies , leads to the pt distribution @xcite . consequently",
    ", if one or more of these conditions does not hold the result may be a width distribution different from pt .",
    "for example , the existence of additional channels results in @xmath94 values greater than one .",
    "it is well known , for example , that the distribution of total radiation widths following neutron capture is described by a @xmath210 distribution with many degrees of freedom by virtue of the many different possible @xmath3-ray channels from the capturing state . however , the lowest - lying excited state of @xmath1sm is at @xmath211 kev .",
    "so , there are no known neutron channels in addition to the elastic one in the energy range of our analysis .",
    "furthermore , the technique used ( transmission measurement ) should yield neutron widths that are fairly insensitive to inelastic channels .    another way of adding an additional effective channel might be through a non - statistical nuclear structure effect such as a doorway state .",
    "it is interesting that a ( parity ) doorway model has been proposed to explain the so - called sign effect @xcite in parity - violating asymmetries for _",
    "p_-wave @xmath199th+_n _ resonances , which occurs at about the same energy as the reported @xcite deviation from a pt distribution for the neutron widths in this nuclide .",
    "it was expected ( based on arguments similar to those leading to the pt distribution ) that the signs of these parity - violating asymmetries would be random .",
    "however , all ten measured asymmetries for resonances below 250 ev had the same sign .",
    "models proposed to explain this sign effect are based on either distant bo92,au92,au92a , fl92,ko92,ca93a , ca95,le92,au94  or nearby au95,fl95,au96,de96,hu95,fe96,lo96 ( parity ) doorway states .",
    "perhaps the same type of model could be invoked to explain the observed deviations in the neutron width distributions from the expected pt shape , while at the same time these deviations might provide some clue to the physical origins of the doorway .",
    "the doorway might produce deviations from the pt shape by effectively providing a second channel .",
    "in addition , it is interesting to note the local - doorway model of ref .",
    "@xcite is associated with the known octupole deformation of @xmath212th .",
    "deformation also is known to be significant in the @xmath24sm region @xcite , and because deformation could have a large effect on @xmath14 decay , it is possible that the same type of model might also explain the strange behavior of the @xmath14 strength function ratio @xcite .",
    "there are at least two arguments against a doorway explanation for the observed effects in @xmath1sm+_n _ resonances as well as the observed deviation of the @xmath199th+_n _ neutron - width distribution from the expected pt distribution .",
    "first , the observed effects are much narrower than expected for a doorway state .",
    "second , doorways having such large effects on the neutron - width distributions presumably also should be visible ( as large steps ) in strength - function plots such as those shown in the bottom part of fig .",
    "d0ands0 . however , there are no such effects visible in this figure nor in the corresponding plot for @xmath199th+_n _ @xcite",
    ".    deviations from a pt distribution also may be caused by forms of symmetry breaking .",
    "for example , isospin - symmetry breaking has been put forward hu2000 as an explanation for differences between reduced - width data and a pt distribution . however , the distributions resulting from these kinds of symmetry breaking are expected to be superpositions of two pt distributions rather than a @xmath18 distribution with @xmath213 as observed herein .    other forms of symmetry breaking can lead to width distributions having @xmath214 .",
    "for example , time - reversal invariance violation ( triv ) implies compound nuclear expansion coefficients that are complex , and hence a second degree of freedom and therefore a @xmath18 distribution having @xmath102 for the neutron widths .",
    "this extra degree of freedom also should effect the level - spacing distribution @xcite , leading to fewer small spacings than a wigner distribution .",
    "unfortunately , these effects in the level - spacing distribution appear to be too small to observe in the present case . spacing distributions for both @xmath9 and @xmath56 for the two different energy regions",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ j3and4space2ereg ] . also shown",
    "are the expected spacing distributions corresponding to pt ( wigner distribution , or gaussian orthogonal ensemble , goe ) and @xmath102 ( the so - called gaussian unitary ensemble , gue ) distributions for the reduced neutron widths .",
    "there is no significant difference between the two measured distributions for @xmath59 and the data are consistent with either theoretical distribution .",
    "although there is some difference between the measured distributions for the two energy regions in the @xmath9 case , given the small number of resonances in each region , this difference can not be used to rule out either theoretical distribution at a reasonable confidence level .",

    "we have shown that the dance detector at lansce is an excellent apparatus for this application .",
    "we have devised a new technique for using the measured multiplicity information to discern resonance spins .",
    "we have demonstrated that this new technique is superior to using the average multiplicity for assigning spins to closely - spaced resonances .",
    "spins were determined for 33 resonances without previous assignments and 8 firm spin assignments were made for resonances previously having only tentative assignments .",
    "there are several other nuclides for which this technique should be applicable and so future measurements of this type could lead to a wealth of new resonance parameter data .",

    "our analysis shows that there are very few missing resonances below @xmath10 ev .",
    "furthermore , using the same techniques that have been used to correct for missed resonances and to demonstrate the validity of the pt distribution for reduced neutron widths , we have shown that the present data are inconsistent with pt .",
    "specifically , the reduced neutron width distribution changes shape near @xmath13 ev , from being consistent with pt below this energy to being inconsistent with pt for the next 350 ev .",
    "this change occurs at the same energy as a previously reported @xcite anomaly in the @xmath14 strength - function ratio for @xmath31 resonances .",
    "a similar unexplained deviation from pt was reported for neutron resonances in @xmath199th ri69,fo71,fo71a , ra72 and five odd - a nuclides @xcite at about the same energy .",
    "we have discussed several possible explanations for these observed non - statistical effects . of the considered explanations ( a previously - unknown low - lying excited state in @xmath1sm , a doorway state , and triv )",
    "only triv is consistent with , but by no means proved by , the data .",
    "indeed we know of no physical explanation why triv would be manifested in these nuclides at this energy at such levels .",
    "it seems more likely that an unknown nuclear structure effect , perhaps one related to deformation , is responsible for the reported anomalies @xcite . finally , with current techniques it should be possible to significantly improve both the accuracy and sensitivity of the previous experiment on which the present @xmath1sm neutron widths are based @xcite .",
