    "rigid motion in newtonian space - time has six degrees of freedom : three translations and three rotations . in other words , there are six arbitrary time - dependent degrees of freedom in constructing a three - parameter congruence of  timelike \" worldlines such that the distance between each pair of infinitesimally separated worldlines remains constant .",
    "this fact greatly simplifies the description of the motion of ( rigid ) extended bodies , and motivated m.  born @xcite to propose a similar definition of rigid motion in the context of special relativity , with  distance \" now defined as the orthogonal distance between neighboring worldlines measured with the minkowski line element . soon afterwards",
    ", g.  herglotz  @xcite and f.  noether  @xcite proved that such born - rigid motions exist , but they have essentially only three degrees of freedom . more precisely ,",
    "there are two types of born - rigid motion in special relativity : ( 1 ) arbitrary time - dependent translations with _ no _ rotation ( so - called _ plane _ motions ) , and ( 2 ) motions generated by a killing field , i.e. , the repeated action of one element of the poincar group ( so - called _ group _ motions).@xcite as the simplest representative example of the latter , the only possible motion of a born - rigid body with one point fixed is an eternal unchangeable rotation.@xcite born - rigid motion in the context of general relativity , especially the rotating case , is considerably more subtle  see @xcite and references therein .    a body of literature has grown out of exploring various relaxations or modifications of born s notion of rigidity ( for examples , see @xcite ) , but as far as the authors are aware no proposal has emerged that recovers the full set of six arbitrary time - dependent degrees of freedom in a geometrically natural ( coordinate independent ) way .    in this paper we will introduce the notion of a _ rigid quasilocal frame _ ( rqf ) , which is simply born s notion of rigidity applied not to a _ three_-parameter congruence ( history of a spatial volume - filling set of points ) , but to a _ two_-parameter congruence ( history of the set of points on the surface bounding a spatial volume ) . this volume - to - surface , or quasilocal , relaxation provides a simple and geometrically natural way around the restrictions found by herglotz and noether : whereas born - rigidity for a three - parameter congruence involves six differential constraints on three functions ( an over determined system),@xcite we will see that an rqf involves only _ three _ differential constraints on three functions , and argue that the space of solutions is parameterized by precisely six arbitrary time - dependent degrees of freedom .",
    "remarkably , the existence of these degrees of freedom is intimately connected with the well known fact that a two - sphere ( as opposed to a closed two - surface of any other genus ) , regardless of its geometry ( the size and shape of the rigid  box \" bounding the volume ) , always admits precisely six conformal killing vectors , which generate an action of the lorentz group on the sphere : three rotations and three boosts.@xcite a single observer undergoing arbitrary acceleration and rotation can be thought of as being acted upon by a time - dependent sequence of local lorentz transformations .",
    "in essence , an rqf extends this notion to a two - sphere s worth of observers being acted upon by a time - dependent sequence of  quasilocal lorentz transformations . \"",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ definition ]",
    "we define the notion of an rqf in a general ( 3 + 1)-dimensional spacetime . in  [ simpleexamples ] we construct two simple , representative examples of rqfs in flat spacetime : ( 1 ) a round sphere undergoing arbitrary time - dependent translations , with no rotation , and ( 2 ) a round sphere undergoing _ constant _ rotation , with no translation .",
    "these examples illustrate the two types of rigid motion allowed by the herglotz - noether theorem . in  [ arbitraryperturbations ] we begin to go beyond these types by considering arbitrary time - dependent infinitesimal perturbations about the simplest rqf  a non - accelerating and non - rotating round sphere in flat spacetime .",
    "we demonstrate that the tangent space to the rqf solution space , at the point of this simplest solution , is spanned by precisely six arbitrary functions of time and , moreover , establish the connection between these degrees of freedom and the natural action of the lorentz group on the sphere , mentioned above .",
    "we close  [ arbitraryperturbations ] with a consideration of infinitesimal perturbations about a generic rqf in curved spacetime , which reveals a peculiar  nonlocality \" in time inherent in rqfs with finite time - dependent rotation .    indeed",
    ", this is where the real difficulty lies : constructing , even in flat spacetime , rqfs with arbitrary finite time - dependent rotation .",
    "the reason can be traced to the relativity of simultaneity , which has the most severe consequences for congruences with _",
    ", i.e. , rotating systems , for which the congruence is not hypersurface orthogonal .",
    "as we shall see , this necessarily activates a certain nonlinear term in the rigidity equations that involves a time derivative , changing the basic nature of the partial differential equations involved .",
    "thus the simplest example that would nevertheless provide a strong proof of principle is a flat spacetime rqf undergoing an arbitrary finite time - dependent rotation , with no translation .",
    "( this problem is essentially the quasilocal analogue of the well known ",
    "ehrenfest s paradox , \" in which a rigid body at rest can never be brought into uniform rotation.@xcite ) in  [ generalrotation ] we construct precisely such an example , solving the rigidity equations iteratively in powers of the rotation rate and its time derivatives . computing the first few terms in the series we find that our approximate solution can be pushed with confidence to the rather extreme case of a round sphere rqf spinning up from rest to angular velocities for which observers on the sphere s equator are moving at 1/3 the speed of light , on a time scale less than the time it takes the sphere to rotate a small fraction of one revolution . finally , in  [ conclusions ] we present conclusions .",
    "we will begin by introducing some notation .",
    "let @xmath2 be a smooth four - dimensional manifold endowed with a lorentzian spacetime metric , @xmath3 , with signature @xmath4 .",
    "naturally associated with @xmath3 is its torsion - free , metric - compatible covariant derivative operator , @xmath5 , and volume element @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath7 denote a two - parameter family of timelike worldlines with topology @xmath0 , i.e. , a timelike worldtube that represents the history of a two - spheres - worth of observers bounding a finite spatial volume .",
    "let @xmath8 be the future - directed unit vector field tangent to this congruence , representing the observers four - velocity .",
    "the spacetime metric , @xmath3 , induces on @xmath7 a spacelike outward - directed unit normal vector field , @xmath9 , and a lorentzian three - metric , @xmath10 . at each point @xmath11",
    "we have a _ horizontal _ subspace , @xmath12 , of the tangent space to @xmath7 at @xmath13 , consisting of vectors orthogonal to both @xmath8 and @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath15 denote the spatial two - metric induced on @xmath16 .",
    "finally , let @xmath17 denote the corresponding volume element associated with @xmath18 .",
    "the time development of our congruence is described by the tensor field @xmath19 .",
    "we adopt the usual terminology : the _ expansion _ is @xmath20 ( the trace part ) ; the _ shear _ is @xmath21 ( the symmetric trace - free part , here and elsewhere denoted by angle - brackets ) ; and the _ twist _ is @xmath22 ( the antisymmetric part ) .",
    "a _ rigid quasilocal frame _ is defined as a congruence of the type just described , with the additional conditions that the expansion and shear both vanish , i.e. , the size and shape , respectively , of the boundary of the finite spatial volume  as seen by our observers , do not change with time : @xmath23 these three differential constraints ensure that @xmath24 is a well defined two - metric on the quotient space of the congruence , @xmath25 , i.e. , the space of the observers worldlines .",
    "it describes the intrinsic geometry of the rigid  box \" bounding the volume , as measured locally by our two - spheres - worth of observers .",
    "notice that there is no restriction on @xmath26the twist of the congruence  since we want to allow for the possibility of our rigid box to rotate , in which case the subspaces comprising @xmath18 are not integrable , i.e. , @xmath8 is not hypersurface orthogonal as a vector field in @xmath7 .",
    "it is instructive at this point to recall the landau - lifshitz radar ranging spatial metric associated with a three - parameter family of observers moving along a congruence formed by the integral curves of a time flow vector field , @xmath27.[14 ] with the observers ( unit ) four - velocity given by @xmath28 , the landau - lifshitz metric is defined as @xmath29 , which clearly measures the  in general time - dependent  orthogonal distance between infinitesimally separated observers .",
    "clearly @xmath15 ( with @xmath28 tangent to @xmath7 ) is the two - dimensional analogue of @xmath30 for a timelike congruence in the three - dimensional spacetime @xmath31 .",
    "landau and lifshitz state that for @xmath30 to be well defined on the quotient space of the congruence it is necessary ( and obviously sufficient ) that @xmath27 be a ( timelike ) killing vector field in the four - dimensional spacetime @xmath32 .",
    "the corresponding condition in the three - dimensional spacetime @xmath31 reads : @xmath33 .",
    "however , we observe that in both the four- and three - dimensional cases this condition is overly restrictive , and so unnecessarily rules out most interesting spacetimes .",
    "only the _ spatial projection _ of this condition is necessary and sufficient for the respective radar ranging metrics to be well defined on the respective quotient spaces : @xmath34 in the four - dimensional case and @xmath35 in the three - dimensional case . because of the spatial projection we can replace @xmath27 with @xmath8 in both cases , and what emerges is the born rigidity condition ( @xmath36 in the three - dimensional case ) .",
    "we thus see precisely how the born rigidity condition is weaker than the killing vector condition .",
    "there are two points to make in this regard .",
    "first , as noted in the introduction , the born rigidity condition is still too restrictive to be of much interest in the four - dimensional case , but not necessarily in the three - dimensional ( rqf ) case .",
    "thus , to the extent that rqfs exist , they might be thought of as the closest we can get to a timelike killing vector field in a general , dynamical spacetime . restricting our attention now to the three - dimensional case , our second point is that under the killing vector condition the observers proper acceleration ( @xmath37 ) projected into @xmath7 ( @xmath38 ) is just the gradient of a scalar : @xmath39 .",
    "however , under the born rigidity condition more general accelerations are allowed .",
    "as we shall see shortly ( in the context of equation  ( [ eq : observersacceleration ] ) below ) , the added generality represents  with a small caveat  precisely the dynamical degrees of freedom of the intrinsic geometry of rqfs .    to further clarify the rqf construction , and to establish notation for the examples in subsequent sections ,",
    "let us restore the speed of light , @xmath40 , ( which was hitherto set to 1 ) and introduce a coordinate system adapted to the congruence .",
    "thus , let two functions @xmath41 on @xmath42 locally label the observers , i.e. , the worldlines of the congruence .",
    "let @xmath43 denote a  time \" function on @xmath42 such that the surfaces of constant @xmath43 form a foliation of @xmath42 by two - surfaces with topology @xmath1 .",
    "collect these three functions together as a coordinate system , @xmath44 , and set @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is a lapse function ensuring that @xmath47 .",
    "the general form of the induced metric @xmath48 then has adapted coordinate components : @xmath49 here @xmath50 , and the shift covector @xmath51 , are the @xmath41 coordinate components of @xmath24 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "( we remind the reader that because @xmath45 instead of @xmath53 , this is _ not _ an adm decomposition of @xmath48 . ) note that @xmath54 is the radar ranging , or orthogonal distance between infinitesimally separated pairs of observers worldlines , and it is a simple exercise to show that the rqf rigidity conditions in equation  ( [ eq : rigiditycondition ] ) are equivalent to the three conditions @xmath55 .",
    "the resulting time - independent @xmath50 is the metric induced on @xmath56 .    in other words ,",
    "an rqf is a _",
    "rigid _ frame in the sense that each observer sees himself to be permanently at rest with respect to his nearest neighbours .",
    "the idea is that this is true even if , for example , a gravitational wave is passing through the rqf , in which case neighboring observers must undergo different proper four - accelerations in order to maintain nearest - neighbour rigidity .",
    "they will also , in general , observe different precession rates of inertial gyroscopes . indeed ,",
    "these inertial accelerations and rotations encode information about both the motion of their rigid box and the nontrivial nature of the spacetime it is immersed in .    it is not obvious that the rigidity conditions ( [ eq : rigiditycondition ] ) can , in general , be satisfied . in this paper",
    "we will explore this possibility in the simplest possible context of rqfs in flat spacetime , and in subsequent papers will consider more general spacetimes , including those representing gravitational waves .",
    "however , assuming that these conditions _ are _ satisfied , we are then free to perform a time-_in_dependent coordinate transformation amongst the @xmath41 ( a relabeling of the observers ) such that @xmath50 takes the form @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is a time - independent conformal factor encoding the size and shape of the rigid box , and @xmath59 is the standard metric on the unit round sphere .",
    "for example , if the observers two - geometry is a round sphere of area @xmath60 , and the observers are labeled by the standard spherical coordinates @xmath61 , then @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "we are also free to change the time foliation of @xmath42 such that @xmath64 , i.e. , @xmath43 is proper time for the observers .",
    "thus we see that the intrinsic three - geometry of an rqf has two functional degrees of freedom that  with the choice of coordinate - fixing described above  are encoded in the two components of the shift covector field , @xmath65 ( which are functions of @xmath43 and @xmath41 ) , as well as the time-_in_dependent conformal factor , @xmath66 , encoding our choice of size and shape of the rigid box .",
    "we may also think of the dynamical degrees of freedom , @xmath65 , as being encoded in the observers ( coordinate independent ) proper acceleration tangential to @xmath7 ( @xmath67 defined earlier ) , whose covariant components are @xmath68 in the adapted coordinate system .",
    "( here an over - dot denotes partial derivative with respect to @xmath43 , and @xmath69 . )",
    "more precisely , in addition to @xmath70 we are free to specify the twist , @xmath26 , on one cross section of @xmath7 , where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the @xmath41 coordinate components of @xmath73 .",
    "a full discussion of the intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of rqfs  their kinematics and dynamics , respectively , will be given elsewhere .",
    "our goal here is only to construct some representative examples of rqfs , and argue that rqfs have the same degrees of freedom of motion as a newtonian rigid body .",
    "( note that @xmath65 , the two dynamical functional degrees of freedom in the rqf intrinsic three - geometry , should not be confused with the six time - dependent functions describing the rigid motion , although they are related . as will become clearer in the examples below ,",
    "the latter determine the congruence , and hence both the intrinsic and extrinsic three - geometry of @xmath7 as a hypersurface embedded in an ambient four - geometry .",
    "as intimated earlier in this section , the intrinsic and extrinsic three - geometry in turn contain information about gravitational and other fluxes of energy , momentum and angular momentum through the system boundary .",
    "these fluxes will not be discussed in this paper . )",
    "we will construct two representative examples of rqfs in flat spacetime : ( 1 ) a round sphere undergoing arbitrary time - dependent translations , with _ no _ rotation , and ( 2 ) a round sphere rotating at a _ constant _ rate , with no translation .",
    "for this example we let @xmath74 denote minkowski coordinates in an inertial reference frame in flat spacetime , with metric @xmath75 .",
    "let @xmath76 define an arbitrary timelike worldline @xmath77 , parameterized by proper time , @xmath43 , around which we will construct the timelike worldtube , @xmath7 , of our accelerating rqf .",
    "let @xmath78 be the four - velocity along @xmath77 , such that @xmath79 , and define the timelike unit vector @xmath80 . at some point along @xmath81 ,",
    "say @xmath82 , choose a spatial triad @xmath83 , @xmath84 , orthogonal to @xmath85 .",
    "define @xmath83 all along @xmath77 by fermi - walker transport ( no rotation of the spatial triad):@xcite @xmath86 here we have collected @xmath87 and @xmath83 into a tetrad , @xmath88 , defined along @xmath77 , and defined @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the acceleration along @xmath77 ( and of course @xmath91 ) . in particular , from equation  ( [ fermiwalker ] ) we have @xmath92 , where @xmath93 are the triad components of the proper acceleration of @xmath77 .",
    "let us now embed , in our spacetime , a two - parameter family of timelike worldlines around @xmath77 : @xmath94 representing a two - sphere s worth of observers ( labeled with spherical coordinates @xmath95 , @xmath96 ) comprising the timelike worldtube , @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath97 are the standard direction cosines of a radial unit vector in spherical coordinates in euclidean 3-space , and @xmath98 is a variable parameter that will turn out to be the areal radius of our round sphere rqf .",
    "a simple calculation reveals that , in the adapted coordinate system @xmath99 , the components of the metric induced on @xmath7 have the form of equation ( [ eq : inducedmetric ] ) with @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 , where @xmath59 is the unit round sphere metric introduced in the previous section .",
    "the components of the observers proper acceleration tangential and normal to @xmath7 are then easily found to be @xmath103 and obviously the twist , @xmath26 , vanishes . note that the normal acceleration , @xmath104 , is a component of the extrinsic curvature of @xmath7 .",
    "insofar as we are not developing the formalism to analyze extrinsic curvature in this paper , the result is stated for completeness , but without proof ( although the result is clearly plausible in this simple case ) .",
    "thus we have constructed an rqf that depends on three arbitrary functions of time : the three independent components of @xmath105 , or , if you will , the three components of the acceleration , @xmath106 , which describes a rigid round sphere of area @xmath60 undergoing arbitrary time - dependent translations . despite the proper accelerations the observers experience , both tangential and normal to the spherical frame they define , they may consider themselves to be  stationary \" in the sense described earlier : each observer sees himself to be permanently at rest with respect to his nearest neighbours . in the spirit of einstein s principle of equivalence@xcite",
    "they can consider themselves to be at rest in a time - dependent gravitational field that varies in strength and direction from one observer to the next .",
    "there are two points worth noting .",
    "first , observe that our construction is valid only if @xmath107 , i.e. , @xmath108 .",
    "in other words , our rqf is restricted in size by a ",
    "rindler horizon .",
    "\" this is not surprising , and obviously must be a generic property of rqfs : for a given size of bounding box there must be a maximum value of some acceleration parameter ( in this case @xmath109 ) in order that the proper acceleration of each observer remain finite . to the extent that rqfs provide a general description of physical systems ( to be discussed in subsequent papers ) , we speculate that quantization may introduce a minimum size for rqfs , and hence a maximum acceleration in quantum gravity .",
    "second , observe that there is what might aptly be called a  temporal stress \" associated with the fact that different observers require different proper accelerations to ensure rigidity , and thus different observers clocks record proper time at different relative rates .",
    "this is analogous to the well known fact that the back of a rocket must have a greater proper acceleration than the front for the rocket to maintain constant proper length ( rigidity ) as measured by co - moving observers , and that these observers then necessarily experience a ",
    "temporal stress.\"@xcite      for this example we let @xmath110 denote cylindrical coordinates in an inertial reference frame in flat spacetime , with metric @xmath111 . as in the previous example , we wish to embed a two - parameter family of timelike worldlines , labeled by coordinates @xmath61 and representing observers on a rigid round sphere of areal radius @xmath98 , but this time with each observer rotating with constant angular velocity @xmath112 about the @xmath113-axis ( @xmath112 as measured by observers at rest in the inertial reference frame ) .",
    "beginning with the ansatz : @xmath114 a simple calculation yields an induced metric of the form given in equation ( [ eq : inducedmetric ] ) , with @xmath115 where a prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath95 .",
    "evidently , for the rotating observers to see a round sphere of areal radius @xmath98 we require : @xmath116 where @xmath117 is a dimensionless measure of how relativistic the system is .",
    "unfortunately , the integral for @xmath118 can not be expressed in terms of elementary functions .",
    "figure  1 shows the results of numerical integration for @xmath119 and three values of @xmath120 .",
    "the sphere , which is round for our co - rotating observers , appears to inertial observers as an increasingly cigar - shaped surface as @xmath121 increases .    to understand this figure ,",
    "consider the tangential velocity of observers on the equator ( @xmath122 ) , given by @xmath123 ( observe that @xmath120 , and hence the angular velocity , @xmath112 , can range from @xmath124 to @xmath125 . ) recalling einstein s famous rotating disk thought experiment,@xcite in which rotating observers on the edge of the disk measure a greater circumference than inertial observers , the radius of the equator of our sphere must contract as @xmath126 increases in order to maintain the desired circumference of @xmath127 .",
    "also note that , since there is no length contraction in a @xmath128 constant plane , the length of each of the curves in figure  1 is simply @xmath129 . thus , in the ultra relativistic limit @xmath130 , @xmath118 ranges from @xmath131 to @xmath132 .",
    ", @xmath133 for @xmath119 and @xmath134 0 , 1 and 5 . the last case corresponds to @xmath135 .",
    "the dots show the locations of observers with @xmath136 .",
    "since there is no length contraction in a @xmath128 constant plane , the dots are equally spaced along each curve.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    substituting these results into equations  ( [ eq : observersacceleration ] ) and ( [ eq : nu ] ) we find @xmath137 notice that the magnitude of the observers tangential proper acceleration along the lines of longitude is maximum around mid latitudes and is directed towards the poles , and that the magnitude of the twist of the congruence is maximum at the poles , as one might expect . as in the previous example , for completeness we state , without proof , that the component of the observers proper acceleration normal to @xmath7 turns out to be @xmath138 which in the slow rotation limit reduces to @xmath139 as expected .",
    "observe that even in this very simple example of constant rotation , compared to the arbitrary time - dependent acceleration in the previous example , the expressions for acceleration ( and twist ) are significantly more complicated here . in the context of relativistic rigidity , rotation is inherently much more subtle than translation .",
    "in the previous section we wrote down the general solution for a round sphere rqf in flat spacetime undergoing arbitrary acceleration but no rotation .",
    "in addition , we saw that even _",
    "constant _ rotation is considerably more complicated , and anticipate that any closed form solution for time-_dependent _ rotation , which is of the most interest to us , may well be intractable .",
    "thus , our strategy in this section is to consider an arbitrary _ infinitesimal _ perturbation about the trivial solution  a non - accelerating , non - rotating round sphere rqf in flat spacetime , which is described by equation  ( [ eq : accelerationonly ] ) with @xmath140 .",
    "perturbing about this solution we begin with the ansatz : @xmath141 where @xmath142 is an infinitesimal parameter and @xmath143 are three arbitrary functions allowing complete freedom for the observers to ",
    "wiggle around . \"",
    "a fourth arbitrary function , @xmath144 , is added to allow for a change in the time foliation of @xmath7 .",
    "while the rqf rigidity conditions are obviously invariant under such a time reparametrization ( which manifests itself in @xmath50 being independent of @xmath145 in equation  ( [ eq : perturbedsigma ] ) below ) , a particular choice of @xmath146 will prove convenient later . in our calculations",
    "we will retain only terms linear in @xmath142 .",
    "the goal is to determine the dimension of the rqf solution space at the trivial solution point . under the fairly mild assumption that the dimension is a continuous function on the solution space",
    ", we will thus determine the dimension of the rqf solution space in general , both for flat and curved spacetimes .    calculating the induced metric as",

    "we now demand that @xmath154 , i.e. , the same rigid box we began with ( a round sphere of areal radius @xmath98 ) , but possibly in a state of motion different from rest . taking the trace and trace - free parts of equation  ( [ eq : perturbedsigma ] ) yields three linear partial differential equations @xmath155 in the three unknown functions @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "the first equation tells us that @xmath156 ( the radial perturbation ) is determined by the vector field @xmath157 ( the tangential perturbation ) , and the second tells us that @xmath157 must be a conformal killing vector ( ckv ) field on the unit round sphere .",

    "this is the part responsible for the failure of the time foliation to be hypersurface orthogonal .",
    "we then have @xmath177 comparing with @xmath178 from  [ simpleexamples - translationonly ] we see that the perturbed solution effectively has an acceleration parameter @xmath179 , proportional to the second time derivative of the translation parameter .    in physical ( coordinate covariant ) terms",
    ", the observers proper acceleration and twist are found using equations  ( [ eq : observersacceleration ] ) and ( [ eq : nu ] ) , and turn out to be @xmath180 ( again , the result for the normal acceleration , @xmath104 , is stated without proof . ) from the first equation we see that a nonzero second time derivative of the translation parameter @xmath181 ( respectively , rotation parameter @xmath182 ) is associated with a tangential proper acceleration having the pattern of a boost diffeomorphism generator , @xmath183 ( respectively , rotation diffeomorphism generator , @xmath184 ) .",

    ", we take the ansatz in equation  ( [ eq : constantrotationansatz ] ) , with @xmath223 and @xmath118 replaced by @xmath224 and @xmath225 given by equations  ( [ eq : rho ] ) and ( [ eq : z ] ) with @xmath120 replaced by @xmath226 .",
    "this is _ not _ an rqf , but if @xmath227 and its time derivatives are sufficiently small , it is a good approximation . to this approximate solution",

    "observers only , not the co - rotating observers . for this to not distort the shape of the round sphere as seen by the co - rotating observers , the shape of the embedded sphere in the inertial frame must change .",

    "the most intriguing aspect of this perturbation away from the constant angular velocity solution is that in general it does _ not _ vanish when @xmath248 : there are terms proportional to @xmath249 in @xmath246 and @xmath247 . for instance ,",
    "consider beginning with a round sphere at rest , spinning it up to some angular velocity parameter @xmath250 at , say , @xmath82 , and then bringing it to rest again , in a time - symmetric fashion so that @xmath251 but @xmath252 .",
    "although at @xmath82 the sphere is spinning with an angular velocity that is momentarily constant , the shape of the sphere as seen by the inertial observers is _ not _ that of a sphere _ eternally _ rotating with the same angular velocity parameter ( @xmath253 in both cases ) : relative to figure  1 there is an additional pushing out near the equator , and pulling in near the poles .",
    "( note , however , that the bending of the meridian lines , @xmath230 , _ does _ vanish at the time - symmetric point , as might be expected . )",
    "the origin of this peculiar behaviour is the dependence of @xmath229 on @xmath254 ( the time _ derivative _ of @xmath230see equation  ( [ eq : sigma33 ] ) ) , which can be traced back to the nonlinear @xmath255 term in the relation @xmath256 , and is also related to the @xmath257 term on the right hand side of equation  ( [ eq : phi_equation_ij ] ) .",
    "moreover , using grtensor ii running under maple it is not difficult to iterate this perturbation expansion to higher powers in @xmath227 and its derivatives .",
    "indeed , we have iterated  two and a half \" more times , up to terms in @xmath258 involving the seventh time derivative of @xmath227 , and there appears to be no obstruction to continuing the iterations indefinitely , except that the expressions grow in size exponentially with successive iterations .",
    "thus it seems that the shape of the sphere at any instant of time , @xmath43 , as seen by the inertial observers , depends not only on @xmath227 at that instant , but also on all of its time derivatives up to infinite order , i.e. , it depends on the entire history of @xmath227 .",
    "this is the  nonlocality \" in time discussed in the context of the linearized rigidity equations in the previous section .",
    "we did not see this behaviour in the case of finite time - dependent translation ( with no rotation ) because in that case the congruence is hypersurface orthogonal , so at worst @xmath51 is exact ( a gradient ) ; in fact , we used a time foliation of @xmath7 for which @xmath51 simply vanishes .",
    "for the case of finite time dependent rotation the twist is nontrivial and , according to equation  ( [ eq : nu ] ) , @xmath51 contains an irremovable co - exact ( curl ) part .",
    "and then the @xmath255 term in the relation @xmath256which is present because of the relativity of simultaneity  comes into play . in the end , though , this nonlocality in time is perhaps not surprising if one recalls that rigid motion already involves nonlocality in space in the sense that the acceleration at one point on the bounding box depends on the accelerations at causally disconnected points : equation  ( [ eq : ckvequation ] ) is an elliptic differential equation .    as an example to test the robustness of our solution , we considered the particular choice of time dependent angular velocity given by @xmath259 that describes a time - symmetric situation in which the sphere spins up to a maximum angular velocity @xmath66 and then back down to zero with a time scale @xmath260 . considering both the absolute and relative magnitudes of the successively higher order terms in the solution ,",
    "we can , with confidence , push our approximate solution to the rather extreme case of @xmath261 and @xmath262 ( with @xmath263 ) .",
    "this corresponds to observers on the sphere s equator spinning up to @xmath264 ( see equation  ( [ eq : vequator ] ) ) on a time scale about equal to the time it takes light to cross the system , in this case a small fraction of one revolution .",
    "rigid motion in newtonian space - time has six time - dependent degrees of freedom : three translations and three rotations .",
    "rigid motions also exist in both special and general relativity , but they are severely restricted , as outlined in the first paragraph of the introduction section .    in this paper",
    "we have introduced the concept of a _ rigid quasilocal frame _ ( rqf ) , which opens up the possibility of rigid motion in both special and general relativity with the full six time - dependent degrees of freedom we have in newtonian space - time . the definition of an rqf , applicable in both flat and curved spacetimes , is identical to born s definition of rigidity,@xcite except the key is to consider not a three - parameter congruence of timelike worldlines ( a swarm of observers filling a three - dimensional volume of space ) , but a two - parameter congruence ( the observers on the topologically @xmath158 boundary of the volume  a _ quasilocal _ frame ) .",
    "as proofs of principle we have constructed , either exactly or approximately , several examples of rqfs in flat spacetime , including one that directly addresses the difficult problem of finite time - dependent rotations  see previous section : rqf resolution of ehrenfest s paradox .",
    "two key aspects of quasilocal rigidity emerged .",
    "the first is that the existence of six degrees of freedom in the rigid motion of our two - sphere s worth of observers is intimately connected with the fact that any two - surface with the topology @xmath158 always admits precisely six conformal killing vectors ( ckvs ) , which generate a representation of the lorentz algebra .",
    "in contrast to the usual case of the lorentz group acting locally on a single observer ( rotations and boosts of his tetrad along his worldline ) , here we have the lorentz group acting _",
    "quasi_locally on a two - sphere s worth of observers along their worldtube .",
    "the second is that finite time - dependent rotations are subtle precisely because they introduce a  nonlocality \" in time : unlike in newtonian space - time it is not possible to specify a cross section of the ( twisting ) congruence in space , on a given time slice , without knowing the entire history of the motion .",
    "of course rqfs are also nonlocal in space in the sense that rigid motion requires observers at different points on the boundary to act in concert .",
    "thus an rqf is an inherently nonlocal construction in spacetime .",
    "( it is perhaps worth emphasizing that in any given spacetime , an rqf is simply a congruence of worldlines with certain geometrical properties . throughout this paper",
    "the word  observer \" is used in an abstract sense .",
    "we are not requiring or implying that a two - sphere s worth of physical observers in a dynamical spacetime can actually adjust their accelerations with physical thrusters in concert to achieve an rqf . also , the existence of rqfs does not require or imply the existence of rigid bodies . )    a large set of results on rqfs exists , generated by various of the present authors , which lie outside the scope of this paper and which will appear in future publications .",
    "for example , the case of a round sphere rqf in a generic spacetime with matter has been analyzed as a series expansion in powers of the areal radius , @xmath98 , similar to the construction of fermi normal coordinates . the analysis  carried out to the first few orders in @xmath98indicates that the transition from flat to curved spacetime introduces no obvious obstructions ; we still obtain six time - dependent degrees of freedom .",
    "moreover , as alluded to in the abstract , the application of rqfs to the problem of motion and the nature of gravitational radiation have yielded several interesting new insights .",
    "in addition to exploring more applications , it is important that the existence and uniqueness ( up to six degrees of freedom ) of solutions to the rqf rigidity conditions be rigorously proven .",
    "exact solutions of at least some representative examples of nontrivial rqfs would also be extremely useful .",
