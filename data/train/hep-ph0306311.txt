    "in this contribution i discuss two topics of two - photon physics . in both of them , handbag diagrams play a major role , but the physics issues are rather different .    several talks in this session have shown the ongoing experimental progress in measuring @xmath2 annihilation into meson or baryon pairs at large energy .",
    "recent theoretical work suggests that these processes might help clarify the long - standing problems in understanding the dynamics of exclusive reactions in fixed - angle kinematics ( i.e.  at large mandelstam variables @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) .",
    "in a second part i investigate what one might learn from the annihilation of two virtual photons into a single @xmath6 , beyond what we have already learned from the measurements with one virtual photon and their theoretical analysis .",
    "this presentation is based on work with p.  kroll and c.  vogt @xcite , where further detail and references can be found .",
    "exclusive two - photon processes like @xmath7 or @xmath8 are described by the hard - scattering mechanism of brodsky and lepage in the limit @xmath9 at fixed @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xcite . in this limit",
    "the process amplitudes factorize into a subprocess involving quarks and gluons and into the distribution amplitudes for the lowest fock states of the produced hadrons .",
    "example graphs are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hard ] .",
    "= 0.43    in evaluating these graphs , one encounters regions of loop momentum where all parton lines except those attached to one or both photons are soft , with momenta of a few 100  mev in the collision c.m . in these regions the assumptions and approximations of the hard - scattering calculation break down and the result is not trustworthy . in the limit specified above this is not a problem : the contribution from such soft regions is power suppressed in @xmath12 and thus harmless within the accuracy of the calculation .",
    "problems do however occur in practical calculations for @xmath3 in the range of a few to a few 10 gev@xmath13 .",
    "depending on what one takes for the distribution amplitudes of the produced particles , the result either undershoots data by an order of magnitude or more , or it receives substantial contributions from the soft phase space regions where the result can not be trusted .",
    "one may take this as an indication that the soft contribution just described plays an important role at experimentally accessible values of @xmath3 , and there are recent theoretical attempts to calculate this contribution in a consistent way @xcite . to justify the approximations of the calculations",
    "we must still require that @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 be large compared with a typical hadronic scale ; in particular one has to avoid the region where @xmath14 is close to resonance masses and the regions of forward or backward scattering angle @xmath15 in the c.m .",
    "the separation of the dynamics into soft and hard pieces now differs from the one in fig .",
    "[ fig : hard ] and is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : soft ] : a hard subprocess @xmath16 is followed by soft hadronization into the final state . in order for the second step to be soft , the initial quark and antiquark must each carry approximately the full four - momentum of one final - state hadron ; all other partons involved in the hadronization process must have soft four - momenta in the c.m .",
    "this soft subprocess can be described by matrix elements of the form @xmath17 between the vacuum and the final state , with a quark - antiquark operator separated along the light - cone @xmath18 .",
    "such matrix elements are parameterized by generalized distribution amplitudes @xcite , which are related to generalized parton distributions by crossing symmetry .",
    "= 0.2    in the limit @xmath9 the soft annihilation contribution is power suppressed in @xmath12 compared with the hard - scattering contribution , but it is in finite @xmath3 that we are interested in . at present",
    "we have no theory for consistently adding the contributions from the two mechanisms without double counting .",
    "since in the kinematics of interest the hard - scattering results are small ( at least when the region of soft loop momenta is discarded ) i will in the following neglect this contribution .",
    "i will in fact assume that the soft annihilation mechanism dominates over all other mechanisms ( for instance of vector dominance type , where the hadronic components of the photons take part in the reaction ) .",
    "this leads to predictions which can be confronted with data .      for pseudoscalar mesons",
    "@xmath19 the soft annihilation mechanism gives the @xmath20 cross section as @xcite @xmath21 the information on the soft subprocess is contained in @xmath22 , which is a form factor of the local operator @xmath23 and hence related with the quark energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the mechanism makes a _ prediction _ for the cross section dependence on the scattering angle @xmath15 in the two - photon c.m . , keeping in mind that the result ( [ meson - x - sect ] ) is not valid for @xmath15 close to @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "a general feature of the handbag graphs ( independently of the approximations needed to evaluate them ) is that the reaction proceeds through a single @xmath26 pair in the @xmath3-channel .",
    "this leads to _ predictions _ of the soft annihilation mechanism for the production ratios of different meson pairs .",
    "the cleanest of them makes only use of isospin symmetry and is @xmath27 this result is easily derived : the two - photon collision produces the pion pair only in a @xmath28-even state , which must have isospin @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath30 state is however forbidden in the handbag mechanism since it is unaccessible for a @xmath26 pair . the prediction ( [ pion - ratio ] ) stands out against the hard - scattering mechanism , where one obtains @xmath31 for pion distribution amplitudes close to the asymptotic one @xcite . for @xmath32 production",
    "we correspondingly have @xmath33 since the isospin argument works at the amplitude level , the relation ( [ rho - ratio ] ) readily generalizes to the cross sections for definite polarization states of the @xmath34 mesons . to my knowledge , a prediction of the hard - scattering mechanism is unfortunately not available for the @xmath32 channel . returning to pseudoscalars ,",
    "one obtains as a further consequence of the handbag mechanism that @xmath35 where the @xmath36 sign signals that to obtain this result one needs su(3 ) flavor symmetry , which is only approximately satisfied .",
    "a further consequence of su(3 ) symmetry is @xmath37 which  contrary to the previous relations  is independent of the reaction mechanism .",
    "its violation in the real world may be taken as a measure of how strongly su(3 ) flavor symmetry is broken in this type of process .",
    "notice that the often cited ratio @xmath38 is _ not _ a prediction of the hard - scattering mechanism , but assumes in addition that the distribution amplitudes of pions and kaons have the same shape ",
    "an assumption one may or may not wish to make .",
    "we can not presently calculate the form factors @xmath22 within qcd , so that we have _ no prediction _ for the @xmath3 dependence of the cross section , nor for its absolute size .",
    "we found that the preliminary data for @xmath39 production from aleph @xcite and delphi @xcite can be described by a form factor @xmath40 which for @xmath3 between 6 and 30  gev@xmath13 behaves as @xmath41 and is similar in size to the electromagnetic pion form factor @xmath42 at large timelike @xmath3 .",
    "there is no reason for these form factors to be equal , since they belong to different currents , but it seems plausible that they should be of similar size .",
    "notice that both @xmath40 and @xmath43 approximately follow the @xmath3 dependence obtained in the hard scattering picture ( which fails badly for the absolute normalization ) . that this might happen over a finite interval in @xmath3",
    "is not in contradiction with the soft annihilation mechanism .",
    "i note that this mechanism has an analog in the crossed channel , namely the feynman mechanism for spacelike form factors and large - angle compton scattering , see @xcite for a recent overview . in these cases ,",
    "a model study has in fact shown how the soft mechanism can systematically mimic the hard - scattering scaling behavior in the @xmath4 region of several gev@xmath13 @xcite .      for a baryon",
    "@xmath44 the soft annihilation mechanism leads to a @xmath45 cross section @xcite @xmath46 with @xmath47 the form factors @xmath48 and @xmath49 belong to the axial current and @xmath50 belongs to the vector current of quarks , with the different flavors weighted by their squared electric charges as in ( [ meson - ff ] ) .    as in the meson case",
    ", we can not calculate these form factors at present and hence have _ no prediction _ for the @xmath3 dependence or the size of the cross section .",
    "we found the cleo and venus data @xcite for @xmath51 production at @xmath3 between @xmath52 and 11  gev@xmath13 rather well described by a form factor @xmath53 that falls like @xmath54 and is somewhat larger in size than the measured magnetic proton form factor @xmath55 at similar @xmath3 .",
    "we neglected @xmath56 at this stage since its prefactor in the integrated cross section is rather small in the range @xmath57 of the data . in the @xmath3 range under study",
    "we find again the same @xmath3 behavior one would obtain in the hard - scattering mechanism , and our discussion of the meson case equally applies here .    our result ( [ baryon - x - sect ] ) _",
    "does predict _ the form of the @xmath15 dependence in terms of one unknown parameter @xmath58 .",
    "we obtain more predictions if we assume flavor su(3 ) symmetry and make further approximations , spelled out in @xcite .",
    "the production ratios of all @xmath59 channels where @xmath44 is in the ground state baryon octet are then expressed in terms of a single parameter @xmath34 , which describes the relative strength of the transitions @xmath60 and @xmath61 . taking @xmath34 between @xmath62 and @xmath63 we find fair agreement with the data of cleo and l3 @xcite for @xmath64 and @xmath65 production , and predict in particular that the cross section for the mixed @xmath66 channel should be much lower than  @xmath67 .",
    "the experimental progress reported at this meeting , both for meson and for baryon pairs , will allow one to refine the phenomenological studies i have reported on .",
    "the @xmath15 dependence of the cross section and production ratios for various channels can be used to test the soft annihilation mechanism .",
    "if it stands up to these tests , the data may be used to extract the various form factors which describe the transition from @xmath26 to simple hadronic systems at a quantitative level .",
    "the annihilation of two spacelike photons into a single @xmath6 is one of the simplest exclusive processes and has been studied for a long time . in the limit where the sum @xmath69 of the photon virtualities becomes infinite , the amplitude factorizes into the short - distance annihilation process @xmath70 and the pion distribution amplitude , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pion ] . compared to the processes discussed in section  [ sec : real ] , the theory of @xmath1 is in much better shape : the hard - scattering kernel at @xmath71 has been known and used to for a long time , and the calculation of the @xmath72 corrections has recently been reported @xcite .",
    "power corrections to the leading - twist result have been estimated by various methods and are found to be moderate , even if one of the photon virtualities is zero .",
    "the pion distribution amplitude @xmath73 is a fundamental quantity describing the structure of the pion .",
    "it is useful to expand it on gegenbauer polynomials in @xmath74 , @xmath75 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 denotes the momentum fraction of the quark in the pion and @xmath77 the factorization scale .",
    "the cleanest experimental constraints on the distribution amplitude come from the cleo measurement @xcite of @xmath78 , where one of the photons is quasi - real .",
    "the amplitude is parameterized in terms of the photon - pion transition form factor , which reads @xmath79\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath80  mev , up to relative corrections of order @xmath81 or @xmath82 .",
    "the @xmath83 dependence of the cleo data is well described by this approximation already at a few gev@xmath13 . analyzing the data in terms of the leading - order formula ( [ real - photon ] )",
    "one finds that the sum @xmath84 is small already at @xmath85  gev .",
    "this conclusion does not change much when taking the @xmath71 corrections into account . without further theoretical assumptions",
    "one can however not conclude that the _ individual _ gegenbauer moments @xmath86 must be small , although this would be in line with theoretical prejudice and with the analysis of other processes ( where however the errors of either theory or experiment are considerably larger ) . for a discussion",
    "i refer to @xcite ; a conflicting point of view concerning theoretical errors is taken in @xcite .",
    "the different @xmath87 dependence of the @xmath86 provides a handle to gain separate information about them from the @xmath83 dependence of @xmath88 , but in order to use this one must have sufficient control over power corrections , whose @xmath83 dependence is much stronger .",
    "data with higher statistics at larger @xmath83 would greatly help in this .",
    "it is natural to ask whether more information can be obtained from data on @xmath89 with both photons off - shell . to leading - power accuracy in @xmath90 , the transition form factor for a virtual photon",
    "can be written as @xmath91 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where i have suppressed the dependence on the renormalization and factorization scale @xmath87 and chosen symmetric variables @xmath92 for symmetry reasons the coefficients @xmath93 are even functions of @xmath94 .",
    "evaluating them one finds the surprising behavior shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : surprise ] .",
    "we see that as soon as @xmath94 becomes different from one , the sensitivity to all but the lowest gegenbauer moments @xmath95 rapidly goes to zero . for",
    "our original goal of gaining information about the pion distribution amplitude one would thus focus on the region of @xmath96 shown in the second plot of the figure . as shown in @xcite , the transition form factor in this region",
    "has indeed some power to distinguish different scenarios for the gegenbauer moments which are neither implausible nor ruled out by the existing cleo data .    in a large region around @xmath97",
    "the form factor is however hardly sensitive to the pion structure at all , except via the pion decay constant @xmath98 .",
    "in fact , one finds that it can be expanded around @xmath97 as @xmath99\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where higher gegenbauer moments @xmath95 always appear with at least a power @xmath100 .",
    "given the results of @xcite one can predict @xmath101 within qcd up to relative corrections of order @xmath102 with a hadronic scale @xmath103 , provided one takes the lowest coefficient @xmath104 as an input parameter . at small enough @xmath94 one may even neglect the terms with @xmath105 and then has a prediction for @xmath101 only in terms of @xmath81 and @xmath98 .",
    "the power corrections in @xmath106 may at least be estimated using the results of @xcite , which would require knowledge of the matrix element @xmath107 .",
    "both this quantity and @xmath104 are in principle amenable to calculation from first principles in lattice qcd , and both can be constrained by phenomenological analysis , for instance of data for the transition form factor at @xmath94 close to 1 .",
    "the transition form factor @xmath101 can in this sense be regarded as a precision observable , whose measurement would allow a rather fundamental test of our understanding of qcd .",
    "it is very similar to the bjorken sum rule for deep inelastic scattering , to which it is intimately related as explained in @xcite .",
    "note that compared with the efforts required to measure the bjorken sum , measurement of @xmath101 can in principle be done in a single experiment for @xmath108 in suitable kinematics .",
    "the bad news is that the cross section is quite low : integrating over @xmath94 from @xmath109 to @xmath110 one obtains a differential @xmath111 cross section of @xmath112  fb  gev@xmath113 at @xmath114  gev@xmath13 .",
    "similarly low rates are obtained in the region @xmath115 discussed above .",
    "experimental investigation appears therefore difficult even at the high - luminosity machines babar and belle in their present setups .",
    "the study of this fundamental process may however become feasible at possible luminosity upgrades of these facilities .",
