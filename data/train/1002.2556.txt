    "multiferroic materials have attracted both scientific and industrial interests , due to their profound physics and novel functionalities , respectively.@xcite among them , many studies have been recently performed for `` improper '' ferroelectric materials,@xcite where ferroelectricity is driven by non - centrosymmetric spin , charge , or orbital ordering . in this case , a stronger magnetoelectric coupling is expected , compared to the conventional proper ferroelectrics . so far , mainly manganites ( such as tbmno@xmath7 , tbmn@xmath0o@xmath8 , and homno@xmath7@xcite ) and other perovskite oxides@xcite have been carefully investigated by means of theoretical and experimental approaches , in order to better understand cross - coupling effects between spin / orbital orderings and dielectric properties .    the search for novel multiferroics other than oxides has already started : recently nnert _",
    "et al._@xcite have suggested the ternary copper chalcogenide cu@xmath0mnsns@xmath1 ( with nominal valences as @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 ) as a candidate of `` improper '' ferroelectricity , using a symmetry - based analysis and the landau phenomenological theory , with the ferroelectricity induced by a peculiar antiferromagnetic ( afm ) mn spin configuration .",
    "experimentally , neutron diffraction measurements have clarified that such afm configuration occurs under @xmath13=8.8 k , with mn - spins slightly deviating from the @xmath14 axis by an angle between 6@xmath15 and 16@xmath15 degree .",
    "moreover , the magnetization curve has suggested the spin quantization axis to be close to the @xmath14 direction.@xcite additionally , the small dependence of susceptibility upon the direction of magnetic field implied a rather small magnetic anisotropy .",
    "similar to the famous stannite , cu@xmath0fesns@xmath1,@xcite cu@xmath0mnsns@xmath1 crystallizes in the tetragonal sphalerite superstructure , which shows the @xmath16 ( no.121 ) space group with symmetry operations \\{@xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24}.@xcite the crystal structure is similar to zincblende , often seen in iii - v and ii - vi type semiconductors , where each cation is tetrahedrally coordinated to anions . in this respect , multiferroic effects in this class of materials might prove useful in the context of semiconductor - based spintronics .",
    "although the sphalerite crystal structure itself lacks inversion symmetry , this does not automatically imply that the crystal is polar : due to the mirror and @xmath25-rotation symmetries , the ferroelectric polarization @xmath2 is forbidden along any direction .",
    "on the other hand , nnert _ et al .",
    "_ have claimed that the experimentally observed afm spin order breaks some symmetries , so that @xmath2 arises along the @xmath3 direction ( _ i.e. _ the crystallographic @xmath26 direction ) with possibly large magnetoelectric coupling.@xcite the landau phenomenological theory , based on the symmetry analysis of both the crystal structure and the magnetic order , is a powerful tool to investigate magnetically - induced ferroelectricity.@xcite however , in order to quantify the value of @xmath2 and to clarify the relation between magnetism and ferroelectricity via the electronic structure , a combination of landau theory and _ ab initio _ density functional theory ( dft ) calculations is desirable.@xcite    mnsns@xmath1 .",

    "first , we will discuss the direction and the value of @xmath2 obtained by dft , confirming the predictions based on landau theory ; afterwards , we will focus on the ferroelectric switching , in terms of different mn - spin configurations along the adiabatic path between positive and negative ferroelectric states .",
    "finally , the microscopic mechanism leading to ferroelectricity via spatially - polar cu and mn charge densities caused by heisenberg - exchange is discussed .",

    "since the observed afm configuration breaks the symmetries ( except for @xmath19 ) , ferroelectric polarization is allowed to be magnetically - induced along the @xmath3 direction . to evaluate @xmath2",
    ", we also perform calculations for the ferromagnetic ( fm ) spin configuration , which is considered as a reference non - polar state : the ferroelectric polarization is then calculated as @xmath45 . to connect paraelectric ( pe ) and ferroelectric ( fe ) states , calculations for noncollinear spin configurations ( see below )",
    "are also performed according to ref.@xcite .",
    "the berry phase approach developed by king - smith and vanderbilt@xcite is employed to calculate the electric polarization @xmath2 , where we integrate over eight @xmath32-point strings parallel to @xmath2 .",
    "in the landau potential terms , the ferroelectric polarization @xmath2 appears as coupled with magnetic order parameters , in terms which are invariant under symmetry operations.@xcite nenrt _",
    "et al._@xcite have built up the free energy equation by considering two mn spins ( @xmath46 with position ( 0,0,0 ) and @xmath47 with position ( @xmath48,@xmath48,@xmath48 ) in the nuclear unit cell ) and set up two magnetic order parameters , _",
    "e.g_. , the fm order parameter , @xmath49 , and the afm order parameter , @xmath50 . from the free energy",

    "thereby , they have concluded that a spontaneous polarization arises along the @xmath3 direction upon the afm configuration .",
    "here we extend their model to fit into our afm supercell with eight mn spins , so that we can discuss the adiabatic switching path between the positive fe ( @xmath55 ) and negative fe ( @xmath56 ) states by changing the direction of mn spins and the consequent electric polarization .",
    "( the same procedure was applied for homno@xmath7 with e - type afm configuration.@xcite ) with these eight mn spins ( labelled as @xmath57 , as in fig.[crystal ] ) , two afm order parameters are constructed as @xmath58 corresponding to the positive and negative ferroelectric domain phases with @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively . in order to switch between the two phases ( as seen in the following section ) , four body - centered mn spins ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) must be flipped . taking into account the irreducible corepresentation of the little group of @xmath16 with the propagation vector @xmath44 , one can write the possible magnetoelectric coupling terms in the second degree of magnetic order parameters and the dielectric term in the landau potential as : @xmath63 & \\ & + c^{xz}_{22}e^{x}_{2}e^{z}_{2}p_{y}+c^{zz}_{12}e^{z}_{1}e^{z}_{2}p_{y } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\ & + \\frac{1}{2}(\\chi^{-1}_{x}p_{x}^{2}+\\chi^{-1}_{y}p_{y}^{2}+\\chi^{-1}_{z}p_{z}^{2}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath14 coefficients denote phenomenological parameters and @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the components of the dielectric susceptibility .",
    "since mn magnetic moments have been experimentally observed in the @xmath67 plane , the terms containing @xmath68 and @xmath69 are omitted in the above equation .",
    "the first and second terms denote exchange terms , the last term is the dielectric energy and the remaining terms are relativistic terms .",
    "the minimization of eq.([lf2 ] ) gives a finite polarization along @xmath3 : @xmath70 & \\ & + c^{xz}_{22}e^{x}_{2}e^{z}_{2}+c^{zz}_{12}e^{z}_{1}e^{z}_{2}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whereas non - zero @xmath71 and @xmath72 are not obtained .",
    "this result confirms nnert s predictions : a spontaneous @xmath51 is evidently induced by the afm coupling .",
    "however , at this point we can not conclude whether the heisenberg - exchange- or the relativistic - interaction terms is dominant in inducing @xmath51 .      [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     here , @xmath51 depends only on the inner products of mn spin vectors , therefore is described by the relative spin angle .",
    "@xmath73 terms in the above equation are neglected because these terms disapper when calculating the polarization difference between fe and pe states . progressive rotation of ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) mn spins can switch the ferroelectric polarization between @xmath55 and @xmath56 continuously . assuming the non - collinear ( nc ) spin configuration as @xmath74 and @xmath75 , eq.([lf2 ] )",
    "becomes @xmath76 indeed , the @xmath77 trend is obtained when we perform dft calculations on the nc configuration by varying @xmath78 between 0 and 180@xmath15 with fully optimized atomic coordinates for each spin configuration .",
    "figure [ noncol ] shows the calculated @xmath79 and the total energy difference @xmath80 along the adiabatic path as a function of the relative mn - spin angle @xmath78 at cu@xmath0mnsnse@xmath1 .",
    "we also show @xmath81 , calculated with atomic coordinates fixed to the case of @xmath82 , so that there is no contribution to the electric polarization from atomic displacements . the similarity between polarization values for fig.[noncol ] ( b ) and ( c ) - including or not the ionic displacements - highlights stannite as a paradigmatic example of _ purely electronic",
    "_ ferroelectricity ( see also discussion below ) .",
    "as expected from landau theory and as pointed out above , the dft - calculated @xmath79 is fitted by a cosine curve , with coefficients @xmath830.0053 and 0.0015 at @xmath37= 0 and 4.0 ev , respectively .",
    "the function @xmath84 shows convex and symmetrical behavior between positive and negative fe states . with increasing @xmath78 from @xmath85 ( positive fe state ) , @xmath84 increases and",
    "reaches maximum value at @xmath82 ( pe state ) with the energy barrier @xmath86 0.68 and 0.25 mev / mn at @xmath37= 0 and 4.0 ev , respectively .",
    "this energy barrier coming from combination of @xmath87 term and @xmath2-related term is much lower than in the homno@xmath7 case , where @xmath88 = 8 mev / mn at @xmath37 = 0 ev.@xcite this is fully consistent with the weak mn - mn exchange - coupling constants involved .",
    "sn atoms do not have magnetic moment .",
    "the orange ( large ) and black ( small ) arrows indicate spins of mn and cu atoms , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    according to the previous section , ferroelectric polarization is induced by heisenberg - exchange coupling between mn spins . we also noted that the heisenberg exchange between collinear spins is more efficient in driving ferroelectric polarization than any spin - orbit dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction@xcite : the order of magnitude of @xmath2 here ( tenth or hundredth of @xmath4 ) is about one order of magnitude higher than that experimentally observed and calculated ( hundredth or thousandths of @xmath4 ) in spiral - based systems such as tbmno@xmath5 .",
    "the origin of ferroelectricity could be explained by analogy with the homno@xmath7 case , where o@xmath89 ions move in order to reduce the magnetic coupling energy between mn spins .",
    "exchange - striction \" mechanism has been referred to as `` inverse goodenough - kanamori '' ( igk ) interaction.@xcite however , since here in cu@xmath90mnsns@xmath91 the mn ions are far apart , the mn spin interaction is too  indirect \" and it is difficult ( and non - intuitive ) to guess how s(se ) ions would move to reduce the magnetic coupling energy . indeed , as shown in fig.[noncol ]",
    "( b ) and ( c ) , @xmath79 and @xmath81 have almost the same value : the ionic displacements are rather small and do not contribute much to @xmath2 .    rather , to explain the  electronic \" origin of the heisenberg - driven polarization , we assume small - size spins ( actually calculated as 0.015 @xmath92 ) on cu sites , which interact with mn spins via `` cu - s(se)-mn '' bonds",
    ". consider s(se ) sites : from the chemical point of view , all of them are equivalent , since they are tetrahedrally surrounded by one mn , two cu and one non - magnetic sn atoms in the symmetry @xmath16 .",
    "however , from the magnetic point of view , due to the small magnetic moments at cu sites , s(se ) ions can have two different magnetic environments at the fe state ( @xmath85 ) : the magnetic moments of the surrounding cu atoms can align either parallel or antiparallel , as shown in fig.[tetra ] ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the anions are therefore split into two categories , they become inequivalent upon this peculiar afm spin ordering , breaking the symmetries and paving the way to ferroelectric polarization .",
    "since mn spins interact via such magnetically inequivalent s(se ) ions , the charge densities at mn sites are modulated by heisenberg - exchange to induce @xmath2 .",
    "similarly , charge densities at cu sites with small magnetic moments caused by mn-@xmath93 and cu-@xmath93 hybridization can polarize .",
    "this is clearly observed in fig.[chg ] , where we show the difference between fe and pe states : mn and cu charge densities are clearly non - symmetric along @xmath26 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath2 along @xmath3 is induced .",
    "the results are consistent with the magnetically broken point group 2 at mn and cu sites ( the point groups at cu and mn sites were  originally \" - _ i.e. _ without magnetic ordering - @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively ) .",
    "the  original \" site symmetry at s(se ) sites is @xmath96 , which is already a polar point group ; therefore , a magnetically induced polar charge does not appear .",
    "we note that , in the pe state ( @xmath82 ) , some cu magnetic moments point along the @xmath97 direction , corresponding to the nc mn spin configuration .",
    "all s(se ) ions have then an equivalent magnetic environment , where half of the cu magnetic moments align parallel to mn and the other half perpendicular to it ( fig.[tetra ] ( c ) ) ; in this configuration , @xmath2 is therefore not expected along any direction .",
    "plane charge density difference between the fe and pe states in cu@xmath0mnsnse@xmath1 : @xmath98 .",
    "( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) show the differences of charge density distributions at @xmath99=0 , 0.125 and 0.25 planes ( _ cf . _",
    "fig.[crystal](a ) ) , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]",
    "we have investigated magnetically - induced ferroelectricity in afm cu@xmath0mnsns@xmath1 and cu@xmath0mnsnse@xmath1 by means of landau theory and dft calculations .",
    "the combination of both methods clearly highlights that the driving force of @xmath2 is not the relativistic term , but the heisenberg exchange term .",
    "microscopically , small localized cu magnetic moments induced by mn magnetic moments play an important role in inducing @xmath2 .",
    "the mn - mn spin interaction via the magnetically inequivalent s(se ) ions produces a polar modulation of the charge density on mn and cu sites , finally inducing a net @xmath2 with predominantly _ electronic _ contribution and negligible contribution from _",
    "ionic displacements_. we therefore show that afm cu@xmath0mnsns@xmath1 and cu@xmath0mnsnse@xmath1 are remarkable examples of novel magnetically - induced ferroelectric materials , with improper multiferroicity branching out into non - oxide and non - octahedral based systems .",
