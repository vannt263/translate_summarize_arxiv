    "to date , most of our knowledge about the relativistic phase of the interstellar medium ( ism ) outside of the galaxy , consisting of relativistic charged particles and magnetic fields , has been obtained indirectly through the detection of synchrotron emission via multi - frequency radio observations ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "synchrotron emission arises from cosmic - ray ( cr ) electron energy losses as these particles are accelerated in the magnetic fields of galaxies .",
    "although the energy density in cr electrons is only @xmath21% of that for cr nuclei , the similarity between the spatial distributions of gamma - ray and synchrotron emission within the galaxy suggests that cr electrons and cr nuclei are fairly well mixed on the scales of a few hundred parsecs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the spatial distribution of a galaxy s synchrotron emission is a function of a galaxy s cr electron and magnetic field distributions .",
    "thus , radio synchrotron maps provide only limited insight on the source distribution of the cr electrons as well as the distances the particles may have traveled before ending up in their current location of emission",
    ".    massive stars ( @xmath48  @xmath5 ) are the progenitors of supernovae ( sne ) whose remnants ( snrs ) , through the process of diffusive shock acceleration @xcite , appear to be the main acceleration sites of cr electrons responsible for a galaxy s observed synchrotron emission .",
    "these same young massive stars are often the primary sources for dust heating as they emit photons which are re - radiated at far - infrared ( fir ) wavelengths .",
    "this shared origin between the fir and radio emission of galaxies is thought to be the foundation for the observed fir - radio correlation among ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and within galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "coupling the shared origin of a galaxy s fir and radio emission with the fact that the mean free path of dust - heating photons ( @xmath2100  pc ) is significantly shorter than the expected diffusion length of cr electrons ( @xmath21 - 2  kpc ) led @xcite to conjecture that the radio image of a galaxy should resemble a smoothed version of its infrared image .",
    "consequently , it appears that the close spatial correlation between the fir and radio continuum emission within galaxies can be used to characterize the propagation history of cr electrons .",
    "this prescription has been shown to hold for galaxies observed at the `` super resolution '' ( @xmath01@xmath6 ) of _ iras _ hires data @xcite and , more recently , for high resolution ( @xmath218@xmath7 ) _ spitzer _ 70@xmath8 imaging ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter m06a ) .",
    "this phenomenology has been further corroborated on scales @xmath450  pc by @xcite who find synchrotron haloes around individual star - forming regions are more extended than fir - emitting regions within the large magellanic cloud .",
    "* hereafter , m06b ) recently studied how the spatial distributions of a galaxy s fir and radio emission vary as a function of the intensity of star formation .",
    "they concluded that cr electrons are , on average , younger and closer to their place of origin within galaxies having higher amounts of star formation activity compared with more quiescent galaxies . using a wavelet - based image decomposition , we extend this work by attempting to characterize separately cr electron populations associated with a galaxy s diffuse disk and its star - forming complexes . we carry out this study for a sample of galaxies observed as part of the _ spitzer _ infrared nearby galaxies survey ( sings ; * ? ? ? * ) and the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt - sings ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for which we have the spatial resolution to resolve physical scales @xmath9  kpc .",
    "the complete study can be found in @xcite .",
    "observations at 24 , 70 , and 160  @xmath1 were obtained using the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ; * ? ? ? * ) as part of the sings legacy science program . a detailed description of the sings observational strategy can be found in @xcite .",
    "radio continuum imaging at 22  cm was performed using the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) as part of the wsrt - sings survey .",
    "a complete description of the radio observations and image processing steps can be found in @xcite .",
    "we match the resolution of the mips and radio images using gaussian psfs rather than the mips psfs , which suffer from significant power in their side - lobes .",
    "we compute the radiation field energy density ( @xmath10 ) of each galaxy using its tir ( @xmath11 ) surface brightness since this parameter is sensitive to the diffusion of cr electrons . using the deprojected area of elliptical apertures ( @xmath12 ) , we calculate tir surface brightnesses @xmath13 along with estimates of @xmath10 for radiation emitted near the surface of a semi - transparent body such that @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a galaxy s bolometric surface brightness , @xmath16 is the speed of light , and all quantities are given in cgs units .",
    "the parenthetical term in equation [ eq - urad ] provides a correction for non - absorbed uv emission that was empirically derived by @xcite using archived fir and uv data for a sample of more than 200 galaxies .      using a phenomenological image - smearing model , first presented by @xcite",
    ", m06b studied how the spatial distributions of fir and radio emission varied as a function of star - formation intensity within 12 spiral galaxy disks .",
    "the basic procedure used here is similar to that presented in m06a , b .",
    "we calculate and minimize the residuals between the free - free corrected radio and observed infrared images after convolving the infrared maps by a parameterized kernel @xmath17 .",
    "the new element is that we now , using a wavlet - based technique , decompose each observed infrared image , into two sub - images : ( 1 ) a _ structure _ image containing features with spatial scale smaller than 1  kpc ; ( 2 ) a _ disk _ image containing all structures with characteristic spatial scales larger than or equal to 1  kpc , largely constituting a galaxy s diffuse disk . the _ structure _ and _ disk _ images are smeared independently , summed , and then compared to the radio image . for a full description of the phenomenological model we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "by plotting the smearing scale - length which best matches the infrared image to the observed radio map versus tir surface brightness ( see figure [ fig-1 ] ) , we find that the fir and non - thermal radio morphologies are more similar to each other for galaxies having higher radiation field energy densities compared to galaxies with lower radiation field energy densities . following the interpretation of m06b ,",
    "our results indicate that cr electrons are , on average , closer to their place of origin in galaxies having higher star formation activity .    as cr electrons propagate through the ism of galaxies they lose their energy due to a number physical processes including synchrotron , inverse - compton ( ic ) scattering , bremsstrahlung , ionization , and adiabatic expansion losses . in normal galaxies synchrotron and ic scattering processes are likely the most significant energy loss terms for cr electrons associated with 1  ghz emission @xcite ; the other terms listed will become non - negligible , however , for galaxies hosting extreme episodes of star - formation like starbursting ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a cr electron having energy @xmath18 will emit most of its energy at a critical frequency @xmath19 where @xmath20 from this , we can express the effective cooling timescale for cr electrons due to synchrotron and ic losses as @xmath21 in simple diffusion models , the propagation of cr electrons is usually characterized by an empirical , energy - dependent diffusion coefficient , @xmath22 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the value of @xmath22 has been found to be around @xmath23 for @xmath0gev crs by fitting diffusion models with direct measurements of cr nuclei ( i.e. secondary - to - primary ratios like boron - to - carbon ) within the solar neighborhood ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we will assume , @xmath24    now , neglecting escape and using a simple random - walk equation , cr electrons will diffuse a distance @xmath25 before losing all of their energy to synchrotron and ic losses . by combining equations [ eq - nube ] and [ eq - de ] , we can express @xmath22 as a function of @xmath26 for a fixed @xmath19 such that , for cr electrons having energies @xmath271  gev , @xmath28      using the above equations , we derive simple , order - of - magnitude estimates to determine whether diffusion and cooling of cr electrons in a steady - state star formation model are able to account for our observations .",
    "taking the mean value of @xmath10 for those galaxies plotted in figure [ fig-1]b ( i.e. @xmath29erg  @xmath30 ) , and assuming @xmath31 , which has been shown to be a reasonable assumption for a large sample of spiral galaxies @xcite , we find from equation [ eq - cool ] that the average cooling time for a 1.4  ghz emitting cr electron is @xmath2@xmath32  yr .",
    "inserting this value into equation [ eq - diff ] , we measure a diffusion scale - length of @xmath26.8  kpc ; this value is clearly off of the scale shown in figure [ fig-1]b . on the other hand , if we instead assume a fixed , typical magnetic field strength of 9  @xmath33 g @xcite , and that @xmath34  erg  @xmath30 , the average cooling time for a 1.4  ghz emitting cr electron is @xmath2@xmath35  yr with a diffusion scale - length of @xmath22.6  kpc .",
    "while this value for @xmath10 is much higher than what we infer from the average tir surface brightness of the sample , it must apply near bright star - forming structures , whose tir surface brightnesses are much greater .",
    "even so , this diffusion scale - length is much larger than any value we find for the best - fit structure scale - lengths . from these simple order of magnitude",
    "estimates it appears that particle fading due to cooling by inverse compton and synchrotron processes alone can not explain the structural differences between the fir and radio maps ; the best explanation seems to be differences in the cr electron population ages .      in order to provide a physical interpretation for the location of galaxies in the best - fit scale - length@xmath10 diagram",
    ", we describe their general locations , designated by roman numerals , in figure [ fig-2 ] . while the placement of ngc  925 , ngc  4725 , ngc  4559 in figure [ fig-1]a may be the result of a signal - to - noise effect",
    ", we will now consider alternative physical explanations .",
    "the irregular galaxies in our sample ( holmb  ii , ic  2574 , and ngc  4236 ) have also been excluded thus far in our discussion due to their lack of a disk component in the fir and radio .",
    "the placement of these objects in figure [ fig-2 ] and their behavior will now be put into the context of our phenomenological picture .",
    "a.   in this region of the diagram we assume a galaxy has just reached a peak in its surface brightness after a recent episode of enhanced star formation ; the episode must have occurred within the last few myr to ensure that snrs are still relatively young and that the morphologies of the radio and infrared emission are similar because cr electrons have not had time to diffuse very far .",
    "b.   after reaching a peak in global star formation activity , those cr electrons associated with the recent enhancement of star formation will dominate the cr population .",
    "as they spread through the galaxy they will begin to lose their energy to synchrotron and ic processes . a galaxy s position along this trend",
    "can not be due to variations in ism parameters alone ; rather , its star formation history is the dominant parameter ( see figure [ fig-1]b ) .",
    "galaxies may move along this part of phase space as star formation activity becomes enhanced and then fades . c.   galaxies in this region are characterized by low star formation activity and have best - fit scale - lengths which are shorter than expected given the trend found in region ii . while this situation can be explained by a signal - to - noise effect ,",
    "it is can also be explained by a significant amount of fir emission arising from an old stellar population .",
    "d.   we find no galaxies occupying this region of phase space in which relatively short global scale - lengths would be measured for a moderate values of @xmath10 .",
    "one way for a galaxy to populate this part of the diagram is if , after a long period of quiescence , it begins to form stars at a moderate rate .",
    "the galaxy would then pass through this region very quickly ( @xmath010@xmath36  yr ) before shifting into region ii .",
    "the lack of such galaxies suggests that , at least in the local universe , star formation in spirals does not completely cease for long periods of time .",
    "e.   the irregulars behave markedly different than the sample spirals .",
    "we do not believe this discrepant behavior to be the result of signal - to - noise effects .",
    "the morphologies and ism of these galaxies do not seem consistent with keeping their cr electrons bound outside of their initial clouds around snrs .",
    "after the cr electrons leave this cloud , the lack of a dense ism and magnetic field to keep them trapped through multiple scatterings off of magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves allows them to easily escape the system and enter intergalactic space .",
    "using a two - component image - smearing analysis , we have separated the signatures of cr electron diffusion at spatial scales corresponding to star - forming structures ( @xmath371  kpc ) and galaxy disks ( @xmath271  kpc ) within 18 galaxies observed as part of sings and wsrt - sings .",
    "our results and conclusions can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the best - fit global scale - lengths decrease as a function of increasing star formation activity as measured by the infrared surface brightness of a galaxy .",
    "our interpretation is that a galaxy s cr electrons are closer to their place of origin within galaxies having intense star formation activity .",
    "2 .   the trend of decreasing best - fit _",
    "global _ scale - length with increasing radiation field energy density is due to higher surface brightness galaxies having undergone a recent enhancement of star formation rather than variations in other ism parameters . for sufficiently large enhancements ,",
    "these galaxies are observed within @xmath210@xmath3  yr of the onset of the most recent star formation episode .",
    "3 .   unlike spirals",
    ", irregular galaxies lack any well defined diffuse disk component at either 70  @xmath1 , or especially at 22  cm . presumably , the cr electrons escape these galaxies soon after leaving their parent star - forming regions due the absence of a dense ism which would keep large - scale interstellar magnetic field locked into place .",
    "this conclusion helps to explain why these galaxies have global fir / radio ratios systematically greater than canonical values .",
    "4 .   as infrared surface brightness increases , the characteristic diffusion scale - length of a galaxy s cr electron population begins to transition at @xmath38 from being biased by cr electrons making up its diffuse disk to being biased by those recently injected near star - forming structures . from this",
    "we conclude that a galaxy s cr electron population transitions from being dominated by old cr electrons to being dominated by young cr electrons as a function of star formation intensity .",
    "the two - component analysis works better than smearing with a single smoothing kernel for spiral galaxies of type sb or later which have high amounts of ongoing star formation activity ( i.e. @xmath240% of the sample ) .",
    "this result suggests that star formation must be intense and highly structured for the two - component analysis of these data to differentiate properly between the different cr electron populations .",
    "e.j.m would also like to thank other members of the _ spitzer _ infrared nearby galaxies survey ( sings ) team for their invaluable contributions to the work presented here , especially those of r.c.kennicutt , jr .",
