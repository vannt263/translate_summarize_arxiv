    "@xcite , it was shown that . in a second , more recent study on awake monkeys  @xcite , power - law scaling was apparent from lfps when considering the statistics of negative peaks , which are known to be related to neuronal firing .",
    "this scale - invariant behavior was taken as evidence for self - organized criticality .    in the present paper",
    ", we attempt to resolve these contradictory observations by first performing the same analysis on negative lfp peaks in cats , and we study the statistical distribution of avalanche sizes , as well as negative peaks in the lfps ( linked to neuronal firings ) , positive peaks , and surrogate data .",
    "we then study similar stochastic problems , and the results obtained by the experimental data analysis can also be observed in purely stochastic systems without the presence of underlying self - organized criticality .",
    "the experimental data used in the analysis consist of simultaneous recordings of multisite local field potentials ( lfps ) and unit activity in the parietal cortex of awake cats ( see fig .  [ exp ] ) , which were obtained from a previous study  @xcite .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the characteristic decay time constant of each exponential event , @xmath2 is the jump amplitude of each event , and @xmath3 are independent poisson processes .",
    "the solution of eq .   can be written as : @xmath4 here , the stochastic variable @xmath5 represents the lfp as the summation of a large number of randomly - occurring synaptic events , each described by a decaying exponential .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    in the limit of a high number of poisson processes with summable intensities ( or in the limit of a finite number of poisson process with high firing rate and suitable scaling on the jump amplitude ) , the solution of equation converges in law towards the solution of the equation : @xmath6 @xmath7 is related to the @xmath2 and the rates of the poisson processes .",

    "in such cases , we say that the tail of the distribution follows a power law .    in this paper",
    ", we are interested in discriminating power - laws another type of the exponentially - tailed distribution . random variables with such distributions are characterized for @xmath13 by an exponential probability density , : @xmath14 given some experimental data , the problem is to identify the parameters of the power - law or exponential law , which means estimating the parameter @xmath15 , and the power - law exponent @xmath16 or the exponential - law intensity @xmath17 .",
    "taking the logarithm of the probability density of a power - law random variable , we obtain @xmath18 .",
    "the histogram of the power - law therefore presents an affine relation in a log - log plot .",
    "similarly , the exponential distribution s histogram is characterized by an affine relation in a log - linear plot .",
    "for this reason , power - laws in empirical data are often studied plotting the logarithm[multiblock footnote omitted ] of the histogram as a function of the logarithm of the values of the random variable , and doing a linear regression .",
    "this dates back to pareto in the 19th century ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "this widely used technique generate systematic errors under relatively common conditions ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , there is not any evaluation of the goodness of fit obtained the power - law assumption . in this paper , we prefer to use a maximum likelihood estimator , which is considered the most reliable of usual estimators ( see @xcite for a comparison of different estimators ) .",
    "it is known to provide an accurate parameter estimate in the limit of large sample size ( see @xcite ) .",

    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    we start by analyzing the power - law scaling from experimental data . to analyze the power - law relations from lfp activity , we exploited the well - known relation between negative lfp peaks and neuronal firing .",
    "we the negative peaks of the lfps as shown in fig .  [ nlfp ] .",
    "the detection was done numerically using a fixed threshold , after digital filtering of the low - frequency components of the signal and the detected peaks were then repositioned in the intact original signal the results of this detection for two different thresholds are displayed in fig .  [ nlfp ] ( top ) .",
    "the detected lfp negative peaks are clearly related to neuronal firing , wave - triggered average ( wta ) of the unit activity .",
    "indeed , the average unit activity presented a clear increase related to the presence of negative peaks of the lfp ( fig .",
    "[ nlfp ] , middle ) .",
    "the same procedure was repeated for all channels , leading to rasters of nlfp activity ( fig .",
    "[ nlfp ] , bottom ) .",
    "we next performed an avalanche analysis based on the occurrence of nlfps .",
    "for high threshold , the avalanche distribution was better fit by a power - law , whereas for low threshold it exponential distribution .",
    "similar results were obtained when the size was defined as the total number of events ( peaks ) within each avalanche ( not shown ) .",
    "this shows that the exact functional form of the distribution highly depends on the peak detection threshold .",
    "using a high detection threshold may give the impression of a power - law relation , but lowering the threshold makes the system tend to an exponential distribution , consistent with the exponential scaling of avalanches calculated from unit activity    to assess the significance of this result , we performed a kolmogorov- test to the same data .",
    "the results of this test are presented in table  [ tab : gofdataavalanches ] for defined the cumulated peak amplitudes .",
    "we observe that the distribution of is globally well fit by an exponential distribution , which is valid for a large proportion of the data . indeed , an exponential fit yields significant p - values for both low and high threshold .",
    "moreover , the estimated parameters for exponential fit hardly change when the threshold is varied , suggesting that the observed exponential fit is meaningful . , the estimated power - law parameters change significantly when changing the detection threshold , thus , although the power - law distribution seems to provide a good fit by a linear regression in a log - log representation , this apparent good fit is not supported by the statistical analysis .    .    to further test the dependence on unit activity ,",
    "we have repeated the same avalanche analysis , but using positive peaks of the lfp . in this case , as expected , the peaks are not related to unit firing ( fig .",
    "[ positive]b ) .",
    "unexpectedly , however , the scaling relations observed in graphical representations are similar for nlfps ( fig .  [",

    "interestingly , there are also some regions where the high distributions ( fig .  [ positive]c , dotted lines ) . here",
    ", the kolmogorov test gave results very close to the case of negative peaks .",
    "thus , similar to negative peaks , the apparent good fit of the power - law distribution is not supported by the statistical analysis ,    another essential test is to generate surrogate data sets . by taking the nlfp data sets , and randomly shuffling the occurrence times of the different peaks , keeping the same distribution of peak amplitudes .",
    "the avalanche analysis was then repeated these randomized events , and the result is shown in fig .",

    "there is no correlation between these peaks and unit activity , but interestingly , the same relations still persist . in particular",
    ", it is quite unexpected that stochastic system seems to give power - law distributed avalanche sizes .",
    "this power - law scaling was seen mostly high threshold , while the low - threshold condition behaved more exponentially .",
    "the opposite scaling was also seen in restricted regions ( fig .",

    "we first investigate computationally whether a power - law relation can be obtained from the peak size distribution of a purely stochastic process . to this end",
