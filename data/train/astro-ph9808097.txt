    "however , a recent study ( wang et al .",
    "1998 ) did not confirm the necessity of invoking the third ( power - law ) component . at the high - energy end ,",
    "psr b0656 + 14 joined the egret - pulsar family with a relatively weak evidence of pulsation ( ramanamurthy et al .",

    ", it is apparent that the spectrum will bend , either gradually or more abruptly , between 10 kev and 100 mev ( figure  [ spectrum ] ) .",
    "such a spectral bending can be used to constrain possible emission sites and mechanisms for these x - rays and gamma - rays",

    "they also suggest that the reported power - law component based on _ asca _ sis data in 1 - 10 kev fitted jointly with _ rosat _ data , if real , should be mainly unpulsed .",
    "the pca and hexte on board _ rxte _ were pointed at psr b0656 + 14 during august 22 ",
    "september 3 , 1997 ( mjd 50682  50694 ) , for about 160 ksec . the _ rxte _ mission , spacecraft and instrument capabilities are described in swank et al .",

    "the hexte comprises two clusters of four scintillation counters .",
    "the net open area of the eight detectors is 1600 @xmath3 ( rothschild et al .",
    "the two instruments pca and hexte have no imaging capability .",
    "their field of view is one degree .",
    "data were first screened according to the following two criteria : ( 1 ) the offset , that is , the difference between the source position and the pointing of the satellite , is less than 0.02 degree ; and ( 2 ) the elevation angle , that is , the angle between the earth s limb and the target viewed from the satellite , is larger than 10 degrees . during the whole observation ,",

    "the total exposure for the hexte is then 153.9 ksec @xmath4 1600 @xmath6 , which is 2.155 @xmath7 sec @xmath3 .    around the same epoch of the _ rxte _ observation , psr b0656 +",
    "14 was also monitored at jodrell bank radio observatory .",
    "the radio ephemeris is summarized in table 1 and used as the input for pulsation search .",
    "the data were reduced to the solar system barycenter and analyzed using the jpl de200 ephemeris , the pulsar position listed in table  [ ephemeris ] , and the _ rxte_-related tasks in the software package ftools v.4.0 .    in the timing analysis ,",
    "pca data were divided into five energy bands with each covering pca channels 6 - 16 ( 2.1 - 6.1 kev ) , 17 - 26 ( 6.1 - 9.8 kev ) , 27 - 55 ( 9.8 - 20.5 kev ) , 56 - 107 ( 20.5 - 40.4 kev ) , and 108 - 249 ( 40.4 - 98.5 kev ) , respectively .",
    "the hexte data were also divided into three bands : hexte channels 14 - 60 ( 15 - 60 kev ) , 61 - 121 ( 60 - 125 kev ) , and 122 - 234 ( 125 - 250 kev ) . to search for pulsation ,",
    "each detected photon was assigned an arrival phase @xmath8 based on the ephemeris in table  [ ephemeris ] , and @xmath9 , with @xmath10 being the pulsar frequency , @xmath11 the barycentric corrected arrival time of the photon , and @xmath12 the radio epoch .",
    "we then binned the photons in each energy band and various combinations of energy bands according to their arrival phases to form lightcurves with 20 and 40 bins in one period .",
    "the result was that none of the lightcurves shows significant deviation from a model steady distribution under the pearson s @xmath13-test ( leahy et al .",
    "1983a , b ) .",
    "we also applied the bin - independent parameter - free @xmath0-test ( de jager , swanepoel & raubenheimer 1989 ) to search for signature of pulsation .",
    "the @xmath0-test was applied to the data in different energy bands and various combinations .",
    "the results of the @xmath0-test all show high probability of the data being consistent with a steady source .",
    "only a very marginal detection of pulsation was found in the whole hexte energy band ( channels 14 - 234 , 15 - 250 kev ) with a 95.5% probability of being inconsistent with a steady source based on the @xmath0-test .",
    "the folded lightcurve in this energy band is shown in figure  [ lightcurve ] . applying the straight @xmath14-test ( the rayleigh test , which is more appropriate if the underlying pulse profile is sinusoidal )",
    ", the probability is 90.6% , while the @xmath15-test gives a probability of 98.4% . in our analysis , the @xmath13-test and the @xmath0-test",
    "were repeated in an interval of pulsation frequencies near the radio one .",
    "unlike the spiky dependence of the @xmath13-value on frequencies , the @xmath0-test gives a smooth variation in the corresponding probability for different frequencies .",
    "none of these trials gives significant evidence of pulsation .",
    "a higher probability was found at a frequency lower than the radio one by @xmath16 hz . at this frequency ,",
    "the @xmath0-test gives a 98.2% probability of pulsation detection in the hexte data covering channels 14 - 234 .",
    "based on these analyses , we do not consider the current observation provides evidence of pulsation from psr b0656 + 14 in the _ rxte _ energy band .",
    "the upper limit of pulsed flux is estimated following the prescription given by ulmer et al .",
    "( 1991 ) assuming a duty cycle of 0.5 we obtain the following 3-@xmath17 upper limits , which are also shown in figure  [ spectrum ] : for pca , @xmath18 in 2.1 - 6.1 kev , @xmath19 in 6.1 - 9.8 kev , @xmath20 in 9.8 - 20.5 kev , @xmath21 in 20.5 - 40.4 kev , and @xmath22 in 40.4 - 98.5 kev ; for hexte , @xmath19 in 15 - 60 kev , @xmath23 in 60 - 125 kev , and @xmath24 in 125 - 250 kev .",
    "in the study with _ rosat _ pspc and _ asca _ sis data , greiveldinger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) reported a three - component spectral model , which consists of two blackbodies with temperature at @xmath25 k and @xmath26 k and a power - law with a photon spectral index of -1.5 .",
    "based on the _ asca _ gis data , the pulsed fraction was estimated to be 71% as a 3-@xmath17 upper limit in 0.5 - 10 kev , or 31@xmath2710% at a 2-@xmath17 level of detection in 0.5 - 2 kev and 100% as a 3-@xmath17 upper limit in 2 - 10 kev . for comparison , the proposed power - law component , which includes both pulsed and unpulsed fluxes , and the 3-@xmath17 upper limit in 2 - 10 kev from _ asca _ gis data for the pulsed flux are plotted in figure  [ spectrum ] . our estimated 3-@xmath17 upper limits from _ rxte _",
    "pca data in 2 - 10 kev are about one order of magnitude lower than that from _ asca _ gis data .",
    "these new upper limits make it plausible that the spectrum of the pulsed flux below 20 kev , if detected , should have a photon spectral index larger than -1.5 , assuming that the index increases from -2.8 above 100 mev",
    "monotonically toward the lower - energy end .",
    "egret pulsars all have power - law spectra typically covering two orders of magnitude in the egret band with best - fit photon spectral indices in the range of @xmath28 to @xmath29 except for the crab and psr b0656 + 14 ( fierro 1995 ; nolan et al .",
    "1996 ; merck et al .  1996 ) .",
    "their spectra all turn flatter at lower energies .",
    "for example , psr b1951 + 32 , though with a steeper spectrum in the egret band , has a spectrum with a photon spectral index of -1.5 around 1 - 10 mev .",
    "this spectral behavior has been discussed and used to form an argument which provides a useful diagnostic to constrain possible emission locations and mechanisms for these high - energy emissions",
    "( chang & ho 1997 ) .",
    "the key issue in that argument is a ` bending energy ' below which the spectrum starts deviating from a cooling one .",
    "a cooling spectrum is due to a cooling model of a steady - state electron / positron distribution and has a photon spectral index of @xmath30 for the dominant cooling mechanism being synchrotron radiation and @xmath31 for curvature radiation . in the parameter space of the electron / positron energy and the distance from the stellar center , which characterizes the strength of magnetic fields and the curvature radius of fieldlines , one can find a line along which the radiative cooling time scale for a certain radiation mechanism is comparable to the dynamical time scale of the relativistic motion of the charges .",
    "the observed radiation is expected to occur around a distance charaterized by a point on that equal - time - scale line at which the critical energy of radiated photons for the corresponding parameters is equal to the observed bending energy . at any other distances , the cooling population of radiating charges , if exists , will have a cooling spectrum with a bending energy either higher or lower than the observed one . in view of the common trait in the spectral behavior of most egret pulsars , it is very likely that if psr b0656 + 14 has a spectrum with a photon spectral index around -1.5 at some energies below 100 mev , it must start getting flatter toward low energy from above 20 kev as required by the _ rxte _",
    "pca upper limits .",
    "a bending energy higher than 20 kev for psr b0656 + 14 suggests an emission location at a distance larger than a couple of @xmath32 cm from the stellar center and the synchrotron radiation being the dominant emission mechanism for radiating charges with a typical pitch angle of about 0.1 to 0.001 . curvature radiation does not yield a reasonable emission location within the light cylinder .",
    "more observations with the _ rxte _ and the future _ integral _ are very much desired for providing better statistics and helping advance our understanding of high - energy emissions from neutron stars .    up to date",
    ", existing observations show that except for the crab , the bending energies for other gamma - ray pulsars are all higher than a few tens of kev , though many of them are not yet well determined . on the other hand ,",
    "some observations also reveal possible nonthermal x - ray emissions around kev from some of the gamma - ray pulsars .",
    "however , they may have an origin different from that of the whole continuum from several tens of kev up to a few gev .",
    "for example , the reported nonthermal emissions around 1 kev for the geminga and psr b1951 + 32 both have a photon spectral index of about -1.5 ( halpern & wang 1997 ; safi - harb , gelman & finley 1995 ) , which , together with their flux magnitudes , makes them a separate component from that of higher energies ; see figure 6 in strickman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and figure 2 in chang & ho ( 1997 ) .    the current observation ,",
    "since no pulsation was detected , can not confirm the power - law component proposed in greiveldinger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for psr b0656 + 14 .",
    "however , the estimated upper limits ensure that if that component is real , it must be mainly unpulsed .",
    "an unpulsed power - law spectrum is not easy to be attributed to magnetospheric emissions .",
    "though in the analysis of wang et al . ( 1998 ) the power - law component was not confirmed , its existence and being unpulsed could just be a good example supporting the idea of the ` electron - positron blanket ' proposed by wang et al .",
    "( 1998 ) future _ axaf _ and _ xmm _ observations will be able to solve this issue .",
