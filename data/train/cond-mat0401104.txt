    "for the last two decades , discovery of unconventional superconductors have fueled intensive research for novel pairing mechanisms .",
    "of particular interest have been the cuprate  @xcite and heavy - fermion  @xcite systems where the very existence of superconductivity is quite surprising due to the strong coulomb repulsion within the framework of the conventional eliashberg - migdal theory  @xcite .",
    "recently discovered class of superconductors close to the ferromagnetic phase such as sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2  @xcite , uge@xmath1  @xcite demand better understanding between symmetry and superconductivity which goes beyond the @xmath0-wave bcs theory .",
    "one of the most puzzling aspects of the superconductivity in the strongly correlated regime is the role of the repulsive coulomb interaction .",
    "common belief is that the pairing mechanism is driven or assisted by the coulomb repulsion to an attractive interaction between electrons which results in spatial or temporal structures in the superconducting wavefunction to avoid direct coulomb repulsion .",
    "even some conventional @xmath0-wave phonon - mediated superconductors such as alkali - doped fullerenes have also shown extraordinarily high transition temperatures  @xcite despite the strong coulomb repulsion near the mott transition  @xcite .    even before the onset of superconductivity ,",
    "direct coulomb interaction is heavily renormalized away by electrons moving in a correlated manner to form a narrow resonance near chemical potential .",
    "the superconductivity in such regime should be understood in terms of those correlated electronic basis , typically called quasi - particles ( qp ) .",
    "the problem of mutual renormalization effects between electron - electron and electron - phonon ( el - ph ) has received a great deal of interest resulting in different interpretations , ranging from the conventional coulomb pseudopotential  @xcite , field - theoretic approaches  @xcite to numerical analysis  @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been pointed out  @xcite that the symmetry of the el - ph interaction critically influences the pairing interaction where the two interactions are so interwoven that the effective pairing interaction can not be reduced into a form similar to the mcmillan formula  @xcite .",
    "we show here on the basis of generic hamiltonians that local orbital correlations are crucial for the superconductivity and , in particular , predict the hund s rule ( hr ) induced superconductivity .",
    "we discuss the local pairing as mediated by self - generated fluctuations within the on - site interactions and show that the coulomb interaction and multiplet interaction work in fundamentally different way than described in perturbative theories .",
    "the hr superconductivity has the spin - triplet pairing state .",
    "in contrast to the well - known non-@xmath0-wave triplet pairing  @xcite , the anti - symmetric part of the exchange symmetry of the pairing wavefunction is taken up by the local orbital variables , leaving the spatial part as the symmetric @xmath0-wave .",
    "we will discuss possible consequences of this new pairing structure .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : models ] , we define the problem in models of multiplet interactions for hund s rule and jahn - teller el - ph couplings . in the following section  [ sec : pairing ] , the pairing mechanism is explained in a perturbation theory of a simplified dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) .",
