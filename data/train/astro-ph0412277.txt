    "in addition , sne are expected to be strong gravitational - wave ( gw ) sources .",
    "about 1  sn per second takes place in the visible universe , but the neutrino burst has been observed only once from sn  1987a , the closest sn in modern history .",
    "gws are even more difficult to detect and have never been measured from any source . on the other hand ,",
    "the next galactic sn probably will be observed with high statistics in several large neutrino detectors as well as with the existing gw antennas .",
    "for the first time there is a realistic opportunity to observe such a cataclysmic event in all forms of radiation .",
    "however , galactic sne are rare so that the next sn neutrinos to be observed could well be the diffuse neutrino background from all cosmic sne .",

    "the proposed gadolinium upgrade  @xcite or a corresponding future megatonne detector may well produce a positive detection .",
    "therefore , it is natural to ask the analogous question whether the diffuse gw background from all past cosmic sne will be important for current or future gw antennas that search for signals from individual astrophysical events or for the stochastic cosmic background that probably arises in the very early universe during the inflationary epoch .",
    "the existing literature focuses on gws from the sn bounce signal in the khz range that is relevant for bar detectors or ground - based laser interferometers such as ligo , virgo , geo and tama .",
    "however , recent studies of sne as gw sources indicate that a much stronger signal may be expected from the large - scale convective overturn that develops in the delayed explosion scenario during the epoch of shock - wave stagnation that may last for several 100  ms before the actual explosion  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the relevant frequencies reach below 1  hz where they may be relevant for space - based detectors .",
    "while we find that a first - generation instrument such as lisa is not sufficient , the gw background from sne may become relevant for a second - generation detector such as the proposed big - bang observatory ( bbo ) .",
    "while a detection of the gw background from sne would be intriguing from the perspective of sn physics , particularly in conjunction with a future detection of the corresponding neutrino background , this possibility could be a significant problem for searches of the inflationary gw background that would probe a very early epoch of the universe .",
    "in fact , if ordinary astrophysical foreground sources were seriously expected to mask the inflationary gws in some range of frequencies , probably an instrument like the bbo should be designed to have its optimal sensitivity in a different frequency range .",

    "for typical event rates and/or lower values of the total gw energy emitted , the gw spectrum from popiii stars could be comparable to or lower than the one expected from inflation . in this case",
    "the zero - frequency limit would influence the gw spectrum only at frequencies below 0.05  hz . in any event ,",
    "the largest problem for a reliable prediction of the gw background from stellar core collapse is the almost complete lack of theoretical understanding of massive popiii stars as gw sources and the extreme uncertainty of their abundance , in fact the uncertainty of their very existence .    in summary ,",
    "the uncertainties of the stochastic gw background from the core collapse of ordinary sne and from popiii stars is large , but it is intriguing that its power is in the ball park of the maximum gw background expected from inflationary models . of course",
    ", the inflationary gw background itself is also very uncertain and could be smaller than the benchmark shown in our figures . if stochastic gws are detected with a future instrument like the bbo , it may be challenging to disentangle the inflationary gws from those caused by sne or the collapse of popiii stars .",
