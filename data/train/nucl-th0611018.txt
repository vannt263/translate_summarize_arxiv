    "the perturbative calculation of the strong nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) potential in the framework of effective - field theory ( eft ) was first suggested by weinberg @xcite .",
    "counting rules systematically arrange the magnitude of a two - nucleon irreducible diagram for calculating the @xmath0 potential in terms of @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes a typical small momentum and/or pion mass @xmath5 and @xmath6 the chiral scale . accordingly , one - pion exchange ( ope ) and a constant two - nucleon contact term are the most dominant contributions . at the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) , there are two - pion exchange ( tpe ) , contact terms with two derivatives and/or pion mass factors , relativistic corrections , _",
    "etc_. if one goes to higher orders , there appear multi - pion exchanges and contact terms with more than two derivatives and/or @xmath5 , and heavy - meson exchange possibly comes into play . at low energies where eft is applicable , a physical process",
    "is mostly governed by the long - range interaction and it is more or less insensitive to what s happening in the short - range region . thus in most cases , heavy mesons are integrated out from the lagrangian and their short - range interaction is accounted for by contact terms .",
    "a physical observable calculated with the @xmath0 potential must be independent of a cutoff value that is introduced in calculating loop diagrams and its transformation to coordinate space .",
    "this can be achieved by contact terms together with some renormalization method .",
    "strong eft potentials thus obtained were applied to the analysis of @xmath0 scattering phase shifts @xcite , showing a well - behaved convergence and predictive power .",
    "the role of the nnlo potential was intensively explored in @xcite where it was shown to be important in extending the predictability of the eft to higher energies .",
    "in addition , it gives a correction to the leading order ( lo ) potential which is non - negligible even at the energy of a few mev .",
    "the above approach has recently been extended to the parity - violating ( pv ) nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) potential  @xcite . since then",
    ", it has been used for the calculation of observables @xcite , especially the pv photon asymmetry @xmath1 in @xmath7 at threshold , where it could be of some relevance .",
    "the pv @xmath0 potential is obtained by replacing a parity - conserving ( pc ) vertex in the strong @xmath0 potential with a pv vertex .",
    "most of the low - energy pv calculations have relied on a one - meson - exchange potential with ddh estimates for the pv meson - nucleon coupling constants  @xcite .",
    "theoretical estimations of @xmath1 have been extensively worked out with this model ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for recent ones ) .",
    "the most elaborate results with various strong - interaction models  @xcite turn out to be basically identical .",
    "the asymmetry is dominated by the pv one - pion - exchange potential ( opep ) and the heavy - meson contribution is negligible .",
    "one can thus discuss whether the measurements of @xmath1 could provide us with an opportunity to determine the weak pion - nucleon coupling constant @xmath8 .",
    "some literature has also investigated the pv two - pion - exchange potential ( tpep ) @xcite .",
    "its contribution to @xmath1 , calculated with the hamada - johnston potential , amounts to about @xmath9% of the opep contribution @xcite .",
    "not surprisingly , the tpep is also part of the pionful eft approach where it appears at nnlo  @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we concentrate on its contribution to the asymmetry @xmath1 mentioned above and consider the questions that its estimate raises .    since the pv asymmetry in @xmath7 is sensitive to the one - pion - exchange contribution",
    ", we adopt the heavy - baryon chiral perturbation ( hb@xmath10pt ) .",
    "we employ the argonne v18 potential for the pc potential and the siegert s theorem for the current operators and consider the pv potential relevant to @xmath7 up to nnlo .",
    "this calculation will allow us to estimate the order and the magnitude of higher - order corrections , which will be important in pinning down the value of @xmath11 and its uncertainty .",
    "at the same time , it will provide a criterion for the validity of the eft approach to the pv phenomena .",
    "in hb@xmath10pt , the order of a diagram is counted in terms of a small momentum @xmath4 ( more precisely @xmath3 ) with the following rules ; i ) a meson propagator is counted as @xmath12 , ii ) a nucleon propagator as @xmath13 , iii ) a loop integral as @xmath14 , iv ) a vertex as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number of derivatives at the given vertex . with these counting rules , diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : pep ] constitute the contributions up to nnlo .",
    "one - pion exchange ( a ) , and the two - pion exchange ( b - d ) and the contact ( ct ) ( e ) terms respectively represent lo and nnlo contributions .",
    "the pv potential is odd in powers of the momentum transfer in momentum space or the radial vector in the configuration space , which changes the orbital angular state by an odd number . in order to keep the wave function of a fermion system antisymmetric",

    "the change of @xmath21 in the pv potential should be an odd number .",
    "for a two - fermion system , the possible combinations of the spin and isospin operators in the pv potential must thus be @xmath22 or ( 0,1 ) . among various possible combinations of spin and isospin operators that give @xmath23 , the term relevant to our estimation of @xmath1 has the following form in momentum space @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) is the momentum of a nucleon 1 in the initial ( final ) state .",

    "leaving aside consistency problems between different approaches , double counting with the tpep considered here for instance , we notice that it compares to the ddh best value of @xmath11 @xmath63 .",
    "the corresponding value of @xmath64 is @xmath65 in units of this value of @xmath11 .",
    "a second contribution is provided by the mn scheme where @xmath66 is treated independently of @xmath57 , which consequently gives @xmath53 dependence in the result .",
    "if we choose @xmath67 , we have @xmath68 in units of @xmath11 .",
    "this value is one order larger than @xmath64 , and therefore the effect of @xmath66 and the dependence on @xmath53 can be non - negligible .",
    "a third contribution stems from a deeper examination of the tpep .",
    "this one has been obtained by removing from the square - box diagram the iterated opep , ignoring the cutoff introduced in actual calculations .",
    "the correction , which involves the whole strong interaction and should contribute to make the results cutoff independent , is not easy to calculate .",

    "here we present and discuss numerical results corresponding to the various contributions outlined in the previous section .",

    "while the potential is almost independent of the cutoff value in the range @xmath80 fm , some sizable deviation from the yukawa form occurs at @xmath81 fm when the cutoff is equal to 500 mev .",

    "therefore one can conclude that the long - range dynamics is essentially cutoff independent and governed by opep . on the contrary , tpep changes sign in the intermediate or short range ( bottom - left panel ) , and the position at which the sign change occurs depends on the cutoff value .",
    "what matters in this behavior is that this change occurs in the intermediate region where tpep is supposed to play an important role .",

    "the small dependence of @xmath83 on the cutoff @xmath70 can be attributed to the sensitivity of @xmath79 in the range @xmath81 fm to @xmath70 . on the other hand",
    ", it seems that the region below @xmath101 fm gives an almost negligible contribution since @xmath79 with @xmath102 mev differs sizably from its value with larger cutoff values below @xmath101 fm , but the difference in @xmath83 is negligible . roughly speaking",
    ", the significant contribution to @xmath99 comes from the region @xmath103 fm .    the tpep contribution to @xmath99 , on the other hand , varies significantly in sign and magnitude .",
    "the change of @xmath88 can be attributed to the strong dependence of @xmath82 on the cutoff value in the intermediate and short ranges .",
    "the sign change , which can be ascribed to a contact term implied by the method used to calculate the potential , is physically questionable . from the behavior of @xmath79 and the sign of @xmath83",
    ", one can deduce that a decreasing term gives a negative contribution to @xmath99 . with a smaller cutoff value ,",
    "the decreasing part of tpep spreads to a larger @xmath104 .",
    "for instance , tpep becomes increasing at around @xmath105 fm for @xmath106 mev , but this occurs around 1.5 fm for @xmath100 mev . in the discussion of @xmath83 , we argued that most of the contribution arises from the region @xmath103 fm . with a smaller cutoff value ,",
    "the negative contribution to @xmath88 becomes more substantial and , as a result , @xmath88 with @xmath100 mev is negative .",
    "the convergence of the tpe contribution with an increasing cutoff value is slower than the ope one , which can also be attributed to the strong dependence of tpep on the cutoff value .",
    "however , @xmath88 will not increase indefinitely and we guess that @xmath88 with @xmath107 mev will not be much different from that in the limiting case @xmath45 . for example , @xmath108 with @xmath109 mev , which suggests that the rate of increase with respect to @xmath70 has decreased compared to that in the smaller @xmath70 region .",
    "thus , without significant error , we can conclude that the tpe contribution to @xmath99 is about 10% of the ope .    all the lec contributions ( @xmath110 )",
    "have a magnitude that decreases with increasing cutoff value . with a smaller cutoff value , @xmath111 is less short - range peaked and more spread out to larger @xmath104 .",
    "taking into account the @xmath103 fm criterion , it is a natural result to have a @xmath112 smaller in magnitude with a larger cutoff .",
    "the @xmath64 contribution is small in comparison of the other ones , but this could be a result of the particular value of @xmath60 used in its calculation  @xcite .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath66 term , absent in the mx scheme , is comparable to the tpep one .",
    "consequently , the choice of the regularization scheme can give a non - trivial effect for the total sum of ope , tpe and lec contributions , @xmath113 .",
    "the @xmath114 contribution is also comparable to the tpep one , but only at small @xmath70 .",
    "as expected from its derivation , it removes the @xmath70 dependence of the ope contribution .",

    "comparison of the results in different columns gives insight on the cutoff dependence , while comparion of rows in the mn case shows how results vary with the renormalization scale , @xmath53 .",
    "this scale is conventionally set to the @xmath58-meson mass , the chiral symmetry breaking scale @xmath6 or the order of the cutoff value  @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "exploring the corresponding dependence with values @xmath134 and 1000 mev , @xmath113 is found to increase with @xmath53 ( algebraically ) .",
    "this is simply related to the contribution of the @xmath66 term which is a logarithmically increasing function of that variable .",
    "the dependence on the cutoff value is found to be opposite in the mx scheme and the mn one with @xmath135 .",
    "since the contributions of the ope plus @xmath114 and @xmath64 terms remain almost constant , the @xmath70 dependence in the mx scheme is mainly due to the tpe one .",
    "the opposite effect in the mn scheme results from the further lec contribution involving @xmath66 , which roughly has the same magnitude but is decreasing instead of increasing with @xmath70 .",
    "the overall @xmath70 dependence is sensitive to the @xmath53 value and can almost vanish ( @xmath120 ) as well as be more pronounced ( @xmath136 1000 mev ) .    because of the considerable dependence on the cutoff @xmath70 ( mx scheme ) or on both the cutoff and the renormalization scale ( mn scheme ) , the uncertainty of @xmath137 or @xmath138 is rather large .",
    "moreover the average value differs from one scheme to the other . in principle",
    ", lec contributions should make low - energy observables independent of the input parameters . in this respect ,",
    "our results are not quite satisfactory . in the mx scheme , further contributions",
    "are definitively required , while in the mn scheme , instead , it appears that an acceptable result could be obtained , provided that a low value of @xmath53 is used .",
    "interestingly , this occurs for a value of @xmath66 that roughly compensates the tpep contribution at short distances , which is partly unphysical .",
    "a cancellation on this basis implies @xmath139 in the log term contributing to @xmath66 ( and perhaps some modification of the associated constant ) .",
    "whatever the approach , results show that ope is a dominant contribution to @xmath99 , and that the nnlo contributions are in a reasonable range of about 10 @xmath140 20 % of the ope contributions for the most stable cases .",
    "we would say it reasonable in the sense that the range is obtained with standard values of input parameters and that , at the same time , the amount of the nnlo contribution has the typical size of higher - order corrections in the eft calculation .",
    "we have considered the pv @xmath0 potential , up to the nnlo , from heavy - baryon chiral - perturbation theory , and applied it to the calculation of the pv asymmetry in @xmath2 at threshold .",
    "the opep appears at the lo , there is no term at the nlo , and tpep and ct terms are picked up at the nnlo .",
    "heavy degrees of freedom are integrated out by introducing a monopole form factor in the fourier transformation of the momentum - space potentials and the corresponding contribution is ascribed to contact terms .",
    "a renormalized lec is obtained from the dimensional regularization and its form depends on the regularization scheme .",
    "we employ the minimal and maximal subtraction schemes to determine this form . lacking a way to fix the renormalized lec , we illustrated its contribution by two terms . the first one is obtained from the @xmath58-resonance saturation of the vector - meson exchange pv potential , and the other one restores the @xmath70 independence of the ope contribution .",
    "in the mn scheme , we have an additional constant term which depends on the renormalization scale .",
    "cutoff dependence is explored with values @xmath141 mev , and regularization - scheme dependence with renormalization scales @xmath142 mev .",
    "the ope contribution to the asymmetry is satisfactorily cutoff independent .",
    "the tpe potential depends strongly on the cutoff value and is somewhat uncertain , in particular in the intermediate range . as a result ,",
    "the tpe contribution to the asymmetry varies widely and even shows a change of sign .",
    "however , the tpe contribution is bounded by the limiting cutoff value @xmath45 and does not exceed about 10% of the ope one .",
    "the lec contributions are found to be significantly dependent on both the cutoff and renormalization scales introduced in their calculations .    the total sum of ope , tpe and lec contributions varies non - negligibly , depending on the choice of the cutoff and renormalization - scale values .",
    "with the parameters considered , we have @xmath143 .",
    "if the pv @xmath2 experiment measures @xmath1 at the order @xmath144 , the present result of @xmath113 can fix the first digit of the weak @xmath145 coupling constant @xmath11 unambiguously .",
    "however , some caution is needed . in principle , the role of lec is to account for degrees of freedom whose microscopic description is practically irrelevant for low - energy processes like the one considered here and , at the same time , to make results independent of parameters or regularization schemes employed in their calculation .",
    "the present treatment of the lec does nt fully satisfy the latter requirement , though some steps in this direction have been considered .",
    "thus , the estimate of @xmath113 made here provides a range in which its _ true _ value may be , but it is still premature to claim the result for sure . for pinning down the _ true _ value of @xmath113 , the lec terms should be treated in a more rigorous and reliable way , _",
    "e.g. _ fitting them to experimental data if possible , obtaining them with lattice calculations , or making a better use of renormalization group methods . a comparison with earlier tpep calculations  @xcite could also be quite useful .",
