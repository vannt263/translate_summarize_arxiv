    "sensitive surveys in the submm and millimeter wavebands have identified a population of distant dusty , active galaxies which may represent the formation phase of massive spheroidal galaxies ( smail , ivison & blain 1997 ; hughes et al .",
    "1998 ; bertoldi et al .",
    "2000 ; scott et al .  2002 ; webb et al .",
    "irrespective of the precise mechanism responsible for the prodigious luminosity of these galaxies , either star formation or dust - reprocessed radiation from an agn , several have been confirmed as high redshift massive , gas - rich galaxies ( frayer et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "one of the most pressing issues for study is to identify the most distant examples .",
    "these provide a critical test of theoretical models of galaxy formation and evolution , which already struggle to produce sufficiently large gas masses in galaxies at @xmath5 ( granato et al .",
    "2002 ) . identifying similarly luminous , gas- and dust - rich mergers at even higher redshifts , @xmath6 ,",
    "will provide even stronger constraints .    in this letter",
    "we discuss the identification and spectroscopic follow - up of two recently discovered submm galaxies in the field of the @xmath0 cluster a851 . exploiting very deep radio and optical / near - infrared images we identified counterparts to both submm sources and subsequently targetted them in spectroscopic observations with the gmos spectrograph on gemini - north .",
    "one of these galaxies has the highest spectroscopic redshift for a scuba galaxy to date , at @xmath4 .",
    "we adopt a cosmology with @xmath7 , @xmath8 and h@xmath9kms@xmath10mpc@xmath10 .",
    "the two scuba galaxies discussed here were identified by cowie , barger & kneib ( 2002 ) in a deep 850@xmath11 m scuba map of a851 ( @xmath12mjy ) .",
    "these observations also detected smmj09429 + 4658 , previously catalogued and studied by smail et al.(1999 , 2002a ) .",
    "the two new sources are smmj09431 + 4700 ( 094303.96 + 470016.0 , all coordinates are j2000 ) , which has an 850@xmath11 m flux density of 10.5mjy , and smmj09429 + 4659 ( 094253.49 + 465952.0 ) at 4.9-mjy .",
    "cowie et al .  (",
    "2002 ) use a detailed lens model for the cluster to estimate that these sources are likely to be amplified by a factor of 1.2 and 1.3@xmath13 respectively .",
    "the 1.4-ghz vla map used in our analysis reaches a 1-@xmath14 noise level of 3.5@xmath11jybeam@xmath10 in the field center .",

    "( 2002b ) .",
    "the radio source surface density down to a 5-@xmath14 limit of 17.5@xmath11jy is 4arcmin@xmath15 ( smail et al .",
    "2002b ) . adopting a nominal error radius of 3@xmath16 for the scuba sources ( smail et al .",
    "2002a ) , this translates into only a 3% chance of an unrelated radio source falling within the scuba error circle . searching within this radius around the position of smmj09429 + 4659 we identify a bright , unresolved ( @xmath170.15@xmath16 ) 970@xmath11jy radio source : h8 [ 094253.42 + 465954.5 ] , 2.5@xmath16 from the submm position . for smmj09431 + 4700",
    "we identify two radio counterparts ; one has a 1.4-ghz flux density of 72@xmath11jy ( h6 : 094304.08 + 470016.2 ) and is 1.2@xmath16 from the submm position , the other has 55@xmath11jy ( h7 : 094303.70 + 470015.1 ) and is 2.8@xmath16 away .",
    "the low surface density of radio sources suggests that h6 and h7 are both related to the submm emission .",
    "both of these sources are slightly resolved in our vla map , with sizes of 0.70.9@xmath16 .",
    "we next exploit deep @xmath18 imaging of this field to identify the radio source counterparts of the submm galaxies in the optical and near - infrared .",
    "these images reach typical 3-@xmath14 depths of @xmath19 in the optical and @xmath20 in the near - infrared and their reduction and calibration are described by kodama et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and smail et al .",
    "( 2002b ) .",
    "we astrometrically align the near - infrared images to the radio frame with a precision of 0.32@xmath16 rms using the positions of 90 sources detected in the two wavebands .",
    "this allows us to pinpoint near - infrared counterparts to the many faint radio sources in our vla map .",
    "all three of the radio counterparts to the scuba galaxies are identified in our optical or near - infrared data : h6 has @xmath21 and @xmath22 , h7 is undetected in @xmath23 but is coincident with a @xmath24 , @xmath25 galaxy , and h8 has @xmath26 and is extremely red @xmath27 .",
    "we show the optical / near - infrared images of these galaxies in fig .  1 .",
    "unfortunately , neither galaxy lies in the sparse _ hst _ mosaic of this field discussed by dressler et al .",
    "( in prep ) and only h6 is detected at sufficient signal - to - noise in our good - seeing optical images to reliably measure its intrinsic fwhm : @xmath28 .",
    "the spectroscopy of these galaxies was attempted with the gmos spectrograph ( davies et al .",
    "1997 ) on gemini - north .",
    "the target of this survey was faint radio galaxies , which are likely to lie at @xmath294 ( owen et al .",
    "2002 ) , and so we aimed for the widest possible wavelength coverage and the highest resolution to maximise the chance of detecting weak emission and absorption features in these optically - faint galaxies . to accomplish this we observed each mask twice , once with the b600 grating ( centered at 4730 ) and then with",
    "the r400 grating ( centered at 7920 ) to provide continuous spectral coverage from 3500  to 1@xmath11 m .",
    "the detectors were read out in 3-amp mode with @xmath30 binning ( along both the spatial and dispersion axes ) .",
    "the resulting pixel scale is 0.145@xmath16 pixel@xmath10 with dispersions of 0.91  pixel@xmath10 ( b600 ) and 1.37  pixel@xmath10 ( r400 ) .",
    "slitlets of 1@xmath31 were placed on each target , giving a resolution of 34 .",
    "a multislit mask was designed for the center field in a851 which includes both submm sources .",
    "a total of 2.5 hrs integration was obtained with each of the b600 and r400 gratings on the nights of march 14 and 15 , 2002 in 0.70.8@xmath16 seeing .",
    "these observations were reduced and calibrated in a standard manner using iraf scripts .",
    "we used a cuar lamp spectrum for wavelength calibration , and removed any remaining offsets using bright sky lines .",
    "the spectra were flux calibrated with observations of feige 34 ( b600 ) and hz44 ( r400 ) observed through a 1@xmath16 long - slit . both h6 and h8 were targeted in the same mask .",
    "h7 s proximity to h6 precluded placing slitlets on both sources .",
    "from the observation of the source h8 ( @xmath32 ) , we are unable to identify either any features or detect the continuum .",
    "however , we do identify a series of strong emission lines in the spectrum of h6 shown in fig .",
    "finally , we have retrieved the _",
    "xmm / newton _ x - ray image of this field from the public archive to place limits on the hard x - ray emission from the submm sources .",
    "this image provides 49.4-ks of useful integration from the epic mos1 and mos2 cameras and allows us to place 3-@xmath14 limits of @xmath33ergss@xmath10 and @xmath34ergss@xmath10 on the unabsorbed 210kev fluxes of smmj09429 + 4659 and smmj09431 + 4700 . adopting a photon index of 1.7 ,",
    "these limits translate into 3-@xmath14 lower bounds on the submm - x - ray spectral indices ( fabian et al .",
    "2000 ) of @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively .",
    "we identify several strong emission lines in the combined gmos spectrum of h6 shown in fig .  2 , including ly@xmath37 , nv and civ . based on the wavelength of the narrow ly@xmath37 line we estimate a redshift of @xmath38 , consistent with the observed wavelengths of the other broader emission features .",
    "this is currently the highest spectroscopic redshift for the counterpart of a scuba galaxy  breaking the @xmath39 barrier for this population for the first time .",
    "while this is only a modest increase in lookback time , compared to the previously most - distant source at @xmath40 , it corresponds to a decrease of a factor of two in the predicted abundance of the massive halos , @xmath41m@xmath3 , believed to host these luminous galaxies ( jenkins et al .",
    "the exponential decline in the space density of the most massive halos at higher redshifts underlines the strong constraints available from identifying the highest redshift submm galaxies .",
    "the 850@xmath11 m flux of smmj09431 + 4700 of 8.8mjy ( corrected for lensing ) translates into l@xmath42l@xmath3 , assuming t@xmath43k.k , and a far - infrared luminosity of l@xmath44l@xmath3 . ]",
    "this makes this galaxy a hyperluminous infrared system ( hylirg , rowan - robinson 2000 ) .",
    "if purely powered by massive star formation , its immense luminosity would require a star formation rate of @xmath45m@xmath3yr@xmath10",
    "!    however , the spectrum of h6 shows the signatures of a weak agn .",
    "the strongest lines include a narrow and symmetrical ly@xmath37 line with a flux of @xmath46ergss@xmath10cm@xmath15 and a fwzi of 55 .",
    "there are also broader emission lines coincident with the expected wavelength of redshifted nv@xmath481239.7 , with an observed fwzi of @xmath49 , and an integrated flux of @xmath50ergss@xmath10cm@xmath15 , and civ@xmath481549 , with a fwzi of @xmath51  and a flux of @xmath52ergss@xmath10cm@xmath15 .",
    "we also identify a number of weaker emission lines and mark these in fig .",
    "the velocity widths of these lines cover a wide range , from a restframe fwhm of 210kms@xmath10 for ly@xmath37 upto @xmath53 550kms@xmath10 for the higher excitation lines .",
    "in addition the morphologies of the nv and civ lines appear very similar ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the spectral properties , line widths and line ratios of this galaxy are very similar to those seen for narrow line seyfert-1 s ( nlsy1 , osterbrock & pogge 1985 ; crenshaw et al .",
    "1991 ) , in particular mrk24 .",
    "this classification is supported by the ratio heii@xmath481640/civ=0.05 , indicative of a nlsy1 or nlqso ( heckman et al .",
    "these galaxies have narrow forbidden and permitted emission lines , fwhm@xmath54700kms@xmath10 , which are thought to result from an increase in the size and density of the broad line region compared to a normal seyfert-1 ( laor et al .",
    "1997 ) .    based on our deep imaging we measure 3@xmath16-diameter photometry of h6 giving : @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 $ ] , @xmath60 $ ] , @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "the @xmath63 color is relatively red , @xmath64 , suggesting the presence of either strong absorption in the @xmath65-band or strong emission in the @xmath66-band .",
    "we note that at @xmath4 the lyman - limit falls just blueward of the @xmath65-band ( indeed emission is seen down to 890  in the restframe , rising as @xmath67 ) , however , several strong lines fall in the @xmath66-band ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "integrating all the flux in the @xmath66-band part of the gmos spectrum we measure a slit magnitude of @xmath68 , in reasonable agreement with the 3@xmath16-diameter aperture magnitude and from this we estimate that 50% of the @xmath66-band light is contributed by ly@xmath37 and nv , a similar calculation for civ suggests that it contributes 35% of the @xmath69-band flux . using the apparent @xmath23-band magnitude of this galaxy we estimate an absolute @xmath66-band magnitude of @xmath70 at @xmath4 ,",
    "although a significant fraction of this light may be contributed by emission lines , including h@xmath71 and [ oiii]@xmath484959,5007 .",
    "we also investigate the spatial extent of the emission lines along our slit  focusing on ly@xmath37 and nv as these lines lie close in wavelength .",
    "we find that ly@xmath37 is spatially extended compared to nv with a fwhm of 0.95@xmath16 versus 0.74@xmath16 .",
    "as the estimated image quality in the @xmath72-band was 0.7@xmath16 at the beginning of the observations , the nv width is consistent with being spatially unresolved .",
    "for ly@xmath37 we measure an intrinsic fwhm of @xmath73  indicating extended ly@xmath37 emission on a scale of 8kpc .    turning to the radio properties of this galaxy ,",
    "the radio luminosity of h6 is @xmath74whz@xmath10 for an @xmath75 spectral slope or @xmath76whz@xmath10 for @xmath77 ( including a 20% correction for lensing ) .",
    "these luminosities correspond locally to those expected for a fr i radio galaxy , although it is equally consistent with strong radio emission from a massive starburst at the level detected in the submm waveband .",
    "the radio - submm spectral index , @xmath78 , is @xmath79 based on the radio emission from h6 ( if h7 contributes as well then @xmath80 ) .",
    "these correspond to a redshift of @xmath81 using the models from carilli & yun ( 2000 ) , in reasonable agreement with our spectroscopic measurement .",
    ", corresponding to only @xmath82 .",
    "it is clear that the radio emission must include a significant contribution from an agn and the estimated redshift is only a lower limit  assuming the galaxy follows the @xmath23@xmath83 relationship for powerful radio galaxies it most likely lies at @xmath84 , jarvis et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . ]",
    "the _ xmm - newton _",
    "observations suggest that unless highly obscured , the intrinsic luminosity of the agn in h6 must be modest , @xmath85210kev@xmath86ergss@xmath10 .",
    "however , the limit on the submm - x - ray spectral index of h6 , @xmath36 , is also consistent with a heavily obscured agn such as ngc6240 ( keel 1990 ) , with n(hi)@xmath87 , at @xmath4 ( fabian et al .",
    "the spectroscopic identification of a second hylirg in the scuba population provides the opportunity for a detailed comparison of the properties of these two galaxies : smmj02399@xmath880136 and smmj09431 + 4700 .",
    "detailed study of smmj02399@xmath880136 has shown that it is a massive , gas - rich system ( ivison et al .",
    "1998 ; frayer et al .  1998 ) , identified with a pair of galaxies : l1 and l2 , at @xmath40 , and has a far - infrared luminosity of l@xmath89l@xmath3 .",
    "l1 hosts a partially obscured agn , which has recently been classified as a broad absorption line ( bal ) qso ( vernet & cimatti 2001 ) . the second component l2 is separated from l1 by about 10kpc in projection ( compared to 50kpc for h6h7 ) , and may be tidal debris rather than an independent galaxy .",
    "apart from their apparent binary morphologies , the most striking similarity between these two hylirgs is that both systems host agn . as highlighted by ivison et al .",
    "( 2000 ) : 80% of the scuba galaxies with known redshifts show some signs of an agn .",
    "the close relationship of agn and qso activity to the growth of supermassive black holes ( smbh ) and the apparent ubiquity of smbh in local , massive spheroids suggests that this is a natural consequence if scuba galaxies are the progenitors of the most massive galaxies in the local universe ( e.g.  sanders et al .",
    "1988 ; silk & rees 1998 ; granato et al .",
    "2001 ; archibald et al .",
    "one measure of the importance of the agn in these systems is to quantify its contribution to their total emission .",
    "x - ray observations of the two hylirg submm galaxies suggests that in neither does the agn dominate the bolometric emission ( bautz et al .",
    "2000 ) , which instead comes from an intense starburst which also produces the substantial masses of dust in these galaxies .",
    "although they do not dominate the energetics , the agn may still have a profound effect on the evolution of these galaxies : the agn in smmj02399@xmath880136 is driving a substantial wind which may in time sweep the central regions of the galaxy clear of gas and dust .",
    "can we find any signs of similar agn - induced feedback in smmj09431 + 4700 ?",
    "there are several hints : the contrast between the narrow , spatially - extended ly@xmath37 emission and the broader , but spatially - unresolved high excitation lines , may indicate that the former arises from emission in an outflow .",
    "this situation is very similar to that seen in some high - redshift radio galaxies , such as 53w002 at @xmath90 ( windhorst , keel & pascarelle 1998 ) .",
    "moreover , the structured broad emission lines seen in h6 are reminiscent of the structures seen in broad emission lines of some radio galaxies and radio - loud quasars ( eracleous & halpern 1994 ) , although those show much larger velocity ranges .",
    "these structured emission lines are interpreted as resulting from scattering of radiation from the agn by outflowing conical winds ( corbett et al .",
    "1998 ) and the same mechanism may be operating in smmj09431 + 4700/h6 . the final connection is from the spectral classification of this galaxy as a nlsy1 , where analysis of examples at @xmath91 have led to the identification of strong nuclear winds and a suggested link to balqsos ( lawrence et al .  1997 ; leighly et al .  1997 ; laor et al .  1997 ) .",
    "if both systems do show signatures of massive outflows ",
    "this suggests that winds powered by the agn ( as well as starbursts ) must be central to our understanding the growth of the spheroidal components in these massive , young galaxies ( granato et al .",
    "the feedback on the system from energy injected by the agn provides one possible mechanism for creating the observed smbh to bulge mass correlation seen in local galaxies ( maggorian et al .",
    "the future evolution of these submm sources will be determined by the ability of the agn to clear the bulk of the gas and dust from the nuclear regions  if they can , then they may evolve into the population of less - obscured qsos .    with regard to the wider environment of h6",
    ", we note a striking coincidence : h6 is just 400kms@xmath10 and less than 1mpc ( @xmath92 ) from an optically - selected galaxy , dg433 ( @xmath93 ) , ( trager et al .",
    "1997 ) , suggesting that the two galaxies inhabit a single structure .",
    "dg433 has a uv spectrum dominated by absorption lines and an estimated star formation rate of @xmath94m@xmath3yr@xmath10 , indicating it is a much less active system than the hyperluminous galaxy h6 .",
    "the relationship between the highly obscured and very active submm - luminous galaxies and the less obscured populations which cluster in the same environments will be one of the most important questions to address in the next few years .    based on observations obtained at the gemini observatory , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc .",
