    "classical and quantum descriptions of a physical system that is considered as composed of interacting subsystems have radically different features .",
    "the typical feature of quantum dynamics is the creation of specifically quantum correlations , the entanglement , among the subsystems . on the other hand ,",
    "the typical property of classical description is the occurrence of chaotic orbits and fractality of the phase space portrait , which can be considered as typically classical type of correlations between the subsystems .",
    "the type of correlations introduced by the dynamical entanglement does not occur in the classical description , and likewise , the type of correlations introduced by the chaotic orbits with fractal structures does not occur in the quantum description .",
    "this intriguing complementarity of the two descriptions represents a problem that is expected to be solved by a detailed formulation of the correspondence principle .",
    "comparison of typical features of classical and quantum mechanics is facilitated if the same mathematical framework is used in both theories .",
    "it is well known , since the work of kibble @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , that the quantum evolution , determined by the linear schroedinger equation , can be represented using the typical language of classical mechanics , that is as a hamiltonian dynamical system on an appropriate phase space , given by the hilbert space geometry of the quantum system .",
    "this line of research was later developed into the full geometric hamiltonian representation of quantum mechanics .",
    "@xcite-@xmath2 $ ] .",
    "such geometric formulation of quantum mechanics has recently inspired natural definitions of measures of the entanglement @xcite , and has been used to model the spontaneous collapse of the state vector @xcite,@xcite , and dynamics of decoherence @xcite .",
    "it is our goal to use the geometric hamiltonian formulation of quantum mechanics to study the relation between the dynamical entanglement and typical qualitative properties of hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "motivated by the fact that the schroedinger equation can always be considered as a hamiltonian dynamical system , and that for hamiltonian systems the definitions and properties of the dynamical chaos are well understood , we shall seek for a formal condition that when imposed on the hamiltonian system representing the schroedinger equation of the compound quantum system renders the hamiltonian dynamics nonintegrable and chaotic .",
    "it is well known that the linear schroedinger equation of quantum mechanics represents always an integrable hamiltonian dynamical system , irrespective of the dynamical symmetries of the system .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the hamiltonian formulation of classical systems , where enough symmetry implies integrability and the lack of it implies the chaotic dynamics .",
    "linearity of the quantum hamiltonian dynamics , and the consequent integrability , is introduced in the hamiltonian formulation by a very large dimensionality of the phase space of the quantum system .",
    "this high dimensionality can be considered as a consequence of two reasons . for a single quantum system ,",
    "say a one dimensional particle in a potential , linear evolution and with it the principle of state superposition require infinite dimensional phase space of the hamiltonian formulation .",
    "if the classical mechanical model is linear , say the harmonic oscillator , the quantum hamiltonian dynamics can be exactly describe on the reduced finite - dimensional phase space , the real plane in the case of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "the other related reason that increases the dimensionality of the quantum phase space compared to the classical model is in the way the state space of the compound systems are formed out of the components state spaces in the two theories . in order to represents the entangled states as points of the quantum phase space the dimensionality of the quantum phase space is much larger than just the sum of the dimensions of the components phase spaces .",
    "the points in the cartesian product of the components phase spaces represent the separable quantum states and form a subset of the full quantum phase space .",
    "needles to say , although the separable states are the most classical - like states of the compound system , they still are quantum states with nonclassical properties like nonzero dispersion of some subsystem s variables",
    ". our main result will be that when the quantum dynamics , represented as a hamiltonian system , is constrained on the manifold of separable quantum states the relation between the symmetry and the qualitative properties of the dynamics such as integrability or chaotic motion is reestablished .",
    "thus , suppression of dynamical entanglement is enough to enable manifestations of the qualitative differences in dynamics of quantum systems and the relation between integrability and symmetry , traditionally related with classical mechanical models .    in order to study the relation between the dynamical entanglement , separability and the properties of hamiltonian formulation of the quantum dynamics we shall use , in this paper , the simplest quantum system that displays the dynamical entanglement , that is a system of two interacting qubits : @xmath3 where @xmath4 are the three pauli matrices of the @xmath5-th qubit , and satisfy the usual @xmath6 commutation relations . in particular we shall compare the dynamics of the system ( 1 ) in the case @xmath7 with the case when @xmath8 .",
    "the former case is symmetric with respect to @xmath9 rotations around @xmath10-axis and the later lacks this symmetry . besides its simplicity , the systems of the form ( 1 ) are of considerable current interest because the hamiltonian of the universal quantum processor is of this form @xcite,@xcite .",
    "various lines of research , during the last decade , improved the understanding of the relation between dynamical entanglement and properties of the dynamics .",
    "strong impetus to the study of all aspects of quantum entanglement came from the theory of quantum computation @xcite .",
    "quantization of classical non - integrable systems , and various characteristic properties of resulting quantum systems , have been studied for a long time @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the dynamical entanglement , between a quantum system and its environment , on the qualitative properties of the dynamics of the system was studied indirectly , within the theory of environmental decoherence @xcite .",
    "the relation between the rates of dynamical entanglement and the qualitative properties of the dynamics in the semi - classical regime was initiated in the reference @xcite and various aspects of this relations have been studied since @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the relation between the symmetry of the genuinely quantum system ( 1 ) and the degree of dynamical entanglement was studied in reference @xcite .",
    "as we shall see , our present analyzes is related to the quoted works , but the relation between the dynamical entanglement and symmetry is here approached from a very different angle    the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "we shall first recapitulate the necessary background such as : the complex symplectic and riemannian geometry of @xmath11 ; hamiltonian formulation on @xmath11 of the quantum dynamics ; geometric formulation of the set of separable pure states and hamiltonian formulation of the constrained dynamics . in parallel with the general reminder",
    ", the explicit formulas for the system of two interacting qubits will be given .",
    "these are then applied , in section 3 , to the study the qualitative properties of the separability constrained dynamics for the qubits systems .",
    "the main results are summarized and discussed in section 4 .",
    "there we also discuss a model of an open quantum system with dynamics that clearly differentiates between the symmetric and the nonsymmetric systems .",
    "hamiltonian formulation of quantum mechanics is based on the fact that the scalar product of vectors @xmath13 in the hilbert space of a quantum system can be used to represent the linear schroedinger equation of quantum mechanics in the form of hamilton s equations . the canonical phase space structure of this equations",
    "is determined by the imaginary part of the scalar product , and the hamilton s function is given by the quantum expectation @xmath14 of the quantum hamiltonian",
    ".    however , due to phase invariance and arbitrary normalization the proper space of pure quantum states is not the hilbert space used to formulate the schroedinger equation , but the projective hilbert space which is the manifold to be used in the hamiltonian formulation of quantum mechanics . in general",
    ", the resulting hamiltonian dynamical system is infinite - dimensional , but we shall need the general definitions only for the case of quantum system with finite - dimensional hilbert space , like the finite collection of qubits , in which case the quantum phase space is also finite - dimensional .",
    "we shall first review the definition of the complex projective space @xmath12 , and then briefly state the basic definitions and recapitulate the formulas which are needed for the hamiltonian formulation of the quantum dynamics on the state space and its restriction on the separable state subset .",

    "the influence of the non - hamiltonian terms of drift ( proportional to @xmath180 and the diffusion ( proportional to @xmath181 ) , with the linblad operator of the form ( 41 ) , is to drive an entangled state towards one of the separable states with the corresponding probability .",
