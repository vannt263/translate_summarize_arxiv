    "in the past few decades , a flux of 511 kev photons @xmath2 ph @xmath3 s@xmath4 emitted in the milky way was reported @xcite .",
    "these 511 kev photons are supposed to originate from the positrons produced .",
    "the predicted production rate of positrons in the bulge and disk are respectively given by @xmath5 s@xmath4 and @xmath6 s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "in particular , the bulge to disk ratio is abnormally high @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the positrons produced in the galactic disk can be explained by some mechanisms , such as novae , supernovae , pulsars and low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxrb ) @xcite .",
    "however , the high positron production rate in the bulge remains a mystery , especially at the central part .",
    "observations indicate that the 511 kev line comes from mainly diffuse sources rather than point sources @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the positrons produced through dark matter annihilation can account for the required production rate @xcite .",
    "for example , ascasibar et al . ( 2006 ) show that dark matter annhilation can give enough positrons , and the dark matter mass should be smaller than 100 mev if the annihilation cross section is velocity - independent .",
    "later , based on the gamma - ray spectral shape , sizun et al .",
    "( 2006 ) further constrain the dark matter mass to smaller than 7.5 mev . although these models can give enough positrons to account for the 511 kev line",
    ", we do not have another independent promising observational evidence to support these models .",
    "also , most of the models depend strongly on the dark matter density profile , annihilation cross - section and the dark matter annihilation channels .",
    "recently , an excess of gev gamma - ray near the galactic centre has been reported @xcite .",
    "the spectrum obtained can be best fitted with the annihilation of dark matter particles with mass @xmath8 gev through @xmath1 channel .",
    "the required annihilation cross - section @xmath9 is about @xmath10 @xmath11 s@xmath4 @xcite , which is consistent with the expected canonical thermal relic abundance cross - section @xmath12 @xmath11 s@xmath4 in cosmology .",
    "based on this result , boehm et al .",
    "( 2014 ) try to use this model to explain the 511 kev line . however , the production rate is too small to account for the required rate @xcite .    in this letter ,",
    "i suggest a possible mechanism to account for both the 511 kev line and the gev gamma - ray excess . by assuming the existence of a large dense cloud near the supermassive black hole @xmath13 years ago and following the model that used to account for the gev gamma - ray excess , the production rate of positrons can satisfy the required rate .",
    "recent studies indicate that a large amount of dense gas @xmath14 in the form of a disk might exist near the galactic centre ( @xmath15 pc ) @xmath16 years ago to account for the young , massive stars extending from 0.04 pc - 0.4 pc @xcite .",
    "the existence of the dense gas can overcome tidal shear in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole and help to explain the truncation of the stellar surface density within 0.04 pc .",
    "part of the cloud is converted to stars and the remainder is accreted onto the supermassive black hole @xcite .",
    "the accretion can last for @xmath17 s , and the number density of the cloud can be as high as @xmath18 @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "most particles in the gas are electrically neutral because the temperature is not enough for ionization @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent studies also indicate that the density of gas was @xmath20 @xmath19 at 1 pc from the galactic centre million years ago to overcome tidal shear @xcite .",
    "the size of such a high density region is probably larger than @xmath21 pc @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "i propose that a large amount of positrons can be produced in the dense gas through pair - production mechanism ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "if the photons produced by dark matter annihilation have energy greater than @xmath23 , pair - production is possible in the field of the nucleus from the surrounding gas .",
    "the pair - production cross - section for photon energy greater than 0.1 gev is @xmath24 @xmath25 @xcite , and it would be smaller for lower energy .",
    "although this cross - section is small , the amount of positrons produced would still be large if the number of gas nuclei is large .",
    "therefore , when a large amount of gamma - ray produced by dark matter annihilation is passing through this dense cloud of gas , a large amount of positrons can be produced .",
    "the positrons produced can also generate secondary photons by bremsstrahlung process .",
    "these photons produced can further produce high - energy positrons . as a result , cascades of electrons , positrons and photons would be produced .",
    "assume that the mean density and the size of the dense cloud are @xmath26 @xmath19 and @xmath27 pc respectively .",
    "the optical depth of the electron - positron pair - production is @xmath28 .",
    "if we assume that the gas cloud density is falling with distance @xmath29 @xcite , the optical depth is @xmath30 . for @xmath31 , each high - energy photon entering",
    "the cloud would generate @xmath32 positrons in the pair - production mechanism @xcite .",
    "the pair - production rate is efficient when the photon energy is greater than 0.1 gev .",
    "since the optical depth is large , the energy of the final positrons produced would be @xmath33 mev ( still relativistic ) .",
    "this satisfies with the strong constraints on higher energy positrons from in - flight annihilations ( @xmath34 mev ) @xcite .",
    "when the positrons leave the dense cloud , they would cool down mainly by synchrontron loss , inverse compton scattering , bremsstrahlung loss and coulomb loss @xcite : @xmath35,\\ ] ] where @xmath36 ev / s , @xmath37 ev / s , @xmath38 ev / s , @xmath39 ev / s , @xmath40 is the number density of hydrogen atom in @xmath19 , @xmath41 is the electron number density in @xmath19 , and @xmath42 is the lorentz factor of a positron . here",
    ", we assume that the magnetic field strength in the galactic bulge is of the order @xmath43 g @xcite .",
    "the survival probability of positrons before forming positroniums is @xcite @xmath44,\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the annihilation cross - section and @xmath46 is the final energy of positrons after cooling . in order to form positronium ,",
    "a positron should cool down to lower than 100 ev . for @xmath47 mev ,",
    "@xmath48 ev and @xmath49 @xmath19 near the galactic centre , only less than 1% of positrons would annihilate with electrons before forming positroniums .",
    "1 shows that our model satisfies the constraint of mev photon spectrum observed @xcite .",
    "a relativistic positron can cool down to non - relativistic in @xmath50 s if the injection energy is @xmath51 mev ( see fig .",
    "this means that the positrons produced @xmath52 s ago by pair - production mechanism in the dense gas would use @xmath50 s to cool down to non - relativistic",
    ". then they would combine with hydrogen atoms to form positroniums and emit 511 kev line .",
    "basically , since we can still observe the strong 511 kev line nowadays , the cooling time scale @xmath53 should be less than the time of existence of the gas cloud @xmath54 .",
    "moreover , the cooling time scale should be longer than the timescale of disappearance of the gas cloud @xmath55 ( the duration between the present time and the moment of the disappearance of the gas cloud ) . based on our calculations ,",
    "the condition @xmath56 is satisfied .",
    "however , since @xmath55 is hard to confirm , we assume that @xmath57 in the following discussion .",
    "in fact , the positrons produced in the dense cloud would finally be trapped by the magnetic field to within 100 pc @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the 511 kev line signal produced by these positrons would only extend to 100 pc from the galactic centre , which seems inconsistent with the morphology observed ( @xmath51 kpc in size ) @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the 511 photon flux from the outer part of galactic bulge ( @xmath58 pc ) can be explained by the morphology of lmxrb ( @xmath59 @xmath3 s@xmath4 rad@xmath4 ) @xcite .",
    "our model is going to account for the unexplained strong 511 kev line from the central part of galactic bulge ( @xmath60 @xmath3 s@xmath4 rad@xmath4 ) .",
    "the rate of dark matter annihilation within a radius @xmath61 is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63^{-(\\beta-\\gamma)/\\alpha}.\\ ] ] following @xcite , we take @xmath64 gev/@xmath11 , @xmath65 kpc , @xmath66 kpc , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( the best - fit value to account for the gev excess ) . by using eq .",
    "( 3 ) and assuming @xmath12 @xmath11 s@xmath4 , the dark matter annihilation rate within 5 pc is @xmath70 s@xmath4 . by using the spectrum calculated in @xcite ,",
    "the total number of photons produced with energy greater than 0.1 gev through dark matter annihilation is 115 per one annihilation ( see fig .  3 ) . assuming @xmath71 , the total number of positrons produced in this pair - production mechanism within 5 pc is @xmath72 s@xmath4 , which is enough to account for the 511 kev line .    on the other hand ,",
    "the diffuse source of positrons produced directly from dark matter annihilation can be estimated by using the positron energy spectrum obtained from @xcite ( see fig .",
    "the total number of positrons produced per one annihilation is 12 . by using eq .",
    "( 3 ) , @xmath73 for @xmath74 kpc . therefore ,",
    "the rate of diffuse positron production within 1 kpc is about @xmath75 s@xmath4 .",
    "this minor diffuse source of positrons requires a bit longer time to cool down to non - relativistic ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "they would finally contribute to the 511 kev line which extend to 1 kpc from the galactic centre .",
    "however , this minor diffuse source is negligible compared with the other available explanations .",
    "the rate of change of total number of positrons in the bulge is given by @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the cross - section of positronium production .",
    "since the energy dependence of the cross - section is an exponential function of the positron energy , the positronium formation rate would be the largest for certain positron energy ( @xmath78 ev ) @xcite . as a result",
    ", a dynamical equilibrium state would be achieved when the positrons are cooled to around 14 ev and become positroniums . in equilibrium , the total number of cooled positrons in the bulge is @xmath79 because @xmath80 s@xmath4 and @xmath81 s@xmath4 .",
    "however , part of the dense cloud would eventually change to stars , and most of the remaining part would be captured by the supermassive black hole .",
    "therefore , the relatively strong 511 kev line would not last forever .",
    "when the dense cloud disappears , the production rate would reduce to @xmath82 s@xmath4 ( from novae , supernovae , pulsars , lmxrb , etc . ) . also , the final batch of positrons produced from the dense cloud would diffuse away and cool down to form positroniums to give 511 kev line . as a result , from the solution of eq .",
    "( 5 ) , the total number of positrons would decrease significantly at @xmath53 after the disappearance of the dense cloud : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the original number of positrons , and @xmath85 is the time after all the positrons produced from the dense cloud disappeared .",
    "when @xmath86 s , the total number of positrons in the bulge would reduce to @xmath87 , and the intensity of the 511 kev line would decrease by a factor of three . in fig .  5 , we show the changes of positron number , gas cloud density and the stregth of 511 kev flux as a function of time .",
    "in this letter , we discuss a possible model to explain the observed 511 kev line . following the dark matter annihilation scenario that used to account for",
    "the gev gamma - ray excess in the galactic centre , the gamma - ray produced by the dark matter annihilation can generate enough positrons ( @xmath72 s@xmath4 ) through electron - positron pair - production inside the dense cloud , if we assume the existence of a dense gas cloud surrounding the supermassive black hole @xmath88 s ago .",
    "the cooling time scale ( diffusion time scale ) of positrons is @xmath89 s. therefore , the strong 511 kev line observed is just a single event , which last for about @xmath50 s after the disappearance of the dense cloud",
    ".    however , the uncertainties in the cloud size and density may significantly affect the optical depth for pair - production .",
    "our model would fail if the optical depth near the supermassive black hole is too small for the high - energy gamma - ray .",
    "therefore , more observational data from the parsec region near the supermassive black hole is needed to verify our proposed model .",
    "to conclude , by assuming a large dense cloud with number density @xmath90 @xmath19 , it can generate enough positrons to account for the 511 kev line and explain the excess gev gamma - ray observed in the galactic center .",
