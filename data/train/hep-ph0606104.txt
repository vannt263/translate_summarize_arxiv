    "minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is one of the most promising candidates of the physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) that may solve the hierarchy problem in the higgs sector  @xcite .",
    "the model predicts a set of superpartners ( sparticles ) whose charges are exactly the same to that of the sm partners but the spins are different by one half .",
    "these sparticles will be directly searched at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern , which is a @xmath3 collider with 14  tev center of mass energy .",
    "the lhc is scheduled to start in 2007 .",
    "one of the interesting features of the mssm model is the conserved r parity , and all sparticles are assigned to have odd r parity .",
    "because of the conservation law , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is stable , and is assumed as a good candidate for the dark matter . at collider experiments , sparticles are produced in pairs , and a sparticle decay should produce at least one lsp .",
    "susy events at collider experiments therefore have a distinctive missing transverse momentum .",
    "if supersymmetry ( susy ) is an exact symmetry , a particle and its superpartner have a same mass .",
    "therefore susy must be broken spontaneously .",
    "the susy is considered to be broken in `` hidden sector '' , and the susy breaking will be mediated to our sector by mediation fields .",
    "the mechanism is already under severe constraints .",
    "for example , the mass of the sfermions with same charge must be universal so that they do not cause dangerous fcnc , or sfermion masses must be so heavy that correction from the susy sector is suppressed .",
    "this suggests that yet unknown symmetry / dynamics exists in the sector .",
    "the origin of the supersymmetry breaking and mediation mechanism may be understood indirectly by measuring masses of the susy particles .",
    "therefore both the discovery and mass determination of the susy particle have been studied intensively in recent years  @xcite .",
    "if susy is broken at some high energy scale and the boundary conditions are universal at the scale , strongly interacting ( si ) susy particles are heavier than electroweakly interacting ( ewi ) susy particles .",
    "for example , gaugino masses follow the relation @xmath4 in the minimal supergravity model , therefore the gluino is six times heavier than the bino - like particles . at the lhc ,",
    "si susy particles will be copiously produced in @xmath3 collisions , and subsequently decay into lighter ewi susy particles .",
    "the gluino and squark decays are associated with jets with high transverse momentum ( @xmath5 ) . the transverse momentum is the order of the gluino and squark masses .",
    "moreover , because the lsp is significantly lighter than the gluino , the lsp from the gluino decay also has a high @xmath5 . they would give a large missing transverse momentum to the susy events .",
    "in addition , decays of the ewi sparticles may produce high @xmath5 leptons .",
    "events from the standard model ( sm ) processes do not have such high @xmath5 particles .",
    "motivated by these observations , following cuts are often applied to reduce the sm background events to the susy signal events  @xcite ;    * an event is required to have at least one jet with @xmath6  gev and three jets with @xmath7  gev within @xmath8 , * the effective mass of the event must satisfy @xmath9  gev , where the effective mass is defined using the transverse missing energy ( @xmath2 ) and the transverse momentum of four leading jets as : @xmath10 if the event has hard isolated leptons , the effective mass may be defined as follows : @xmath11 where sum of the lepton @xmath5 can be taken over the leptons with @xmath12  gev and @xmath13  gev .",
    "* the missing transverse energy must satisfy the relation : @xmath14 * the transverse sphericity @xmath15 must be greater than 0.2 , where @xmath15 is defined as @xmath16 , with @xmath17 and @xmath18 being the eigenvalues of the @xmath19 sphericity tensor @xmath20 formed by summing over the transverse momentum of all calorimeter cells .    to reduce the background further , hard , isolated lepton(s ) may be required .",
    "these cuts are good enough to reduce the sm backgrounds from @xmath21+@xmath22-jets and @xmath23+@xmath22-jets productions down to a manageable level , although the production cross section of the sm processes may be @xmath24 higher than signal cross sections . while the susy production section reduces very quickly as sparticle masses increase beyond 1  tev , but the signature peaks at higher @xmath1 where backgrounds can be ignored .",
    "previous studies show that the squark and gluino with mass around 2.5  tev can be found at the lhc in the minimal super gravity model ( msugra ) .    in msugra",
    ", the sm background after the cuts can be neglected safely .",
    "then , the distribution of accepted events are also useful to determine the mass scale of susy particles .",
    "for example , the peak of the @xmath1 distribution is sensitive to the squark and gluino masses . for the events with same flavor",
    "opposite sign dileptons , the invariant mass distributions , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , are useful to reconstruct the susy particle masses @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "recently it is pointed out that a string inspired model based on the flux compactification ( kklt models )  @xcite predicts a mass relation different from that of the msugra  @xcite .",
    "this is called mixed modulus anomaly mediation ( mmam ) model .",
    "this model has a volume modulas @xmath32 and a compensator field of minimum supergravity model @xmath33 as a messenger of the susy breaking .",
    "the susy mass spectrum depends on the ratio of the two susy breaking parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the unification scale of the sparticle masses depends on the ratio .",
    "it is interesting that the unification scale of the soft susy parameters can be much lower than the gut scale in this model .",
    "they may unify even at the weak scale for a special choice of the model parameters .",
    "when sparticle masses are degenerated at the weak scale , we expect a reduced probability to have high @xmath5 jets , and smaller @xmath1 and @xmath2 for given squark and gluino masses .",
    "this means that the standard susy cuts reduce the signal events as well , and susy discovery is more affected by the sm background .",
    "quantitative understanding of the sm background may be required in this case .",
    "existing background estimates have large theoretical uncertainty coming from the scale of the strong coupling .",
    "recently , several groups has emphasized importance to include the matrix element correction  @xcite in the previous parton shower estimate of the background , which significantly change the background distribution in the signal region .",
    "when overlap between the signal and background distribution is large , as it is expected in the degenerated susy spectrum , the uncertainty of the background must be taken seriously , and we also need to reconsider the cuts to reduce the background .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to illustrate the phenomenology of the degenerated supersymmetry .",
    "we take the mmam model as an example . by changing the ratio @xmath36 , the mass spectrum changes smoothly from msugra - like one to anomaly - mediation - like one . in between",
    ", there are regions of parameters where squark , slepton , and gaugino masses are significantly degenerated compared with those expected in msugra .",
    "the model therefore provides one dimensional parametrization from the `` transverse signature '' to its non - transverse limit .",
    "the investigation of our analysis may easily be extended to other susy / non - susy scenarios with @xmath2 signature , such as the universal extra dimension model or little higgs model with @xmath32 parity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the mmam model and its mass spectrum with an emphasis on the region of parameter space where sparticle masses are degenerated . in section 3",
    ", we describe our monte carlo simulations . in section 4 , we study how susy event distribution depends on sparticle mass degeneracy and compare it with the background .",
    "we find that the signal @xmath1 distribution is quite similar to that of the background if @xmath37 .",
    "however we find a certain relation among @xmath2 and @xmath1 that is universal for the model with heavy colored particle that decays into the stable neutral particle lhc will miss the susy signature if @xmath38 .",
    "section 5 is devoted to discussions and conclusions .",
    "in this section , we briefly describe the mmam model following the notation in @xcite . in this model",
    ", all shape modulus and dilaton will be fixed by non - zero flux on a cy manifold in the type iib string theory .",

    "the mass spectrum in the matter sector depends on @xmath52 .",
    "if yukawa couplings @xmath61 are non - vanishing only for the combination @xmath102 satisfying @xmath103 , or if the effect of the yukawa couplings in the rge can be ignored , the scalar masses and trilinear couplings also unify at the same scale of the gaugino mass unification .",

    "<S> discovery of supersymmetric ( susy ) particles at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has been studied for the models where squarks and gluino are much heavier than the lightest supersymetric particle ( lsp ) . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the susy discovery in the models with degenerated mass spectrum up to @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> such mass spectrum is predicted in certain parameter region of the mixed modulas anomaly mediation ( mmam ) model . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the effective transverse mass of the signal for the degenerated parameters shows the distribution similar to that of the background . experimental sensitivity of the susy particles at the lhc therefore depends on the uncertainty of the background in this class of model . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that susy signal shows an interesting correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 which may be used to determine the signal region properly to enhance the s / n ratio even if the sparticle masses are rather degenerated . </S>",
    "<S> the structure is universal for the models with new heavy colored particles decaying into visible particles and a stable neutral particle , dark matter . </S>"
