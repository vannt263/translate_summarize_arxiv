    "optical solitons have promising potential to become principal carriers in telecommunication due to their capability of propagating long distances without attenuation and changing their shapes @xcite . therefore considerable attention is being paid theoretically and experimentally to analyse the dynamics of optical solitons in optical waveguides ( for example silica fibers ) under different contexts @xcite .",
    "such investigations are helpful for realizing optical soliton applications , particularly in soliton - based optical communication systems @xcite and nonlinear optical switches @xcite .",
    "the waveguides used in such optical systems are usually of kerr type @xcite .",
    "consequently the dynamics of light pulses are described by the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) family of equations with cubic nonlinear terms @xcite . however , as the intensity of the incident light field becomes stronger , non - kerr nonlinearity effect comes into play and due to this additional effect , the physical features and the stability of nls soliton can change @xcite .    the way through which non - kerr nonlinearity influences nls soliton propagation is described by the nls family of equations with higher - degree nonlinear terms @xcite .",

    "are not completely integrable and can not be solved exactly by the inverse scattering transform method . in such non - integrable systems , therefore , the details of soliton - interaction during collision can not be described exactly and hence are still open to debate .",
    "however , numerical stimulations @xcite show that even the slightest change from the kerr nonlinearity results in the two solitons annihilating each other , merging or creating many new solitons , depending on the initial inclination of the two solitons and their shapes .",
    "but besides the important problem of computer time , the numerical approach is not very appealing in the sense that it is not a simple task to get physical insight from purely numerical experiments .",
    "the idea therefore is to use approximate analytical methods such as perturbation technique , variational method , etc .",
    ", in order to compensate for the lack of exact results @xcite .",
    "by treating the quintic nonlinear terms due to non - kerr effect as perturbations of the cubic nls equations , i.e. restricting the effects of quintic nonlinearity to be less predominant than the cubic terms , the nls equations are studied both analytically and numerically in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we have obtained for the first time ( to our knowledge ) an integrable system of coupled nls equations including cubic - quintic terms describing the effects of quintic nonlinearity with arbitrary coupling , which generalizes the coupled hybrid nls equations with cubic nonlinearity @xcite .",

    "a remarkable interrelation between the newly proposed integrable model and the celebrated manakov model @xcite helps to use the recently discovered general two - soliton solution of the later model @xcite .",
    "this reveals the fascinating occurrence of shape changing inelastic soliton collision also in the present model , in addition to some other interesting features .",
    "we believe that such a study using higher - order solitons ( multisolitons ) becomes important in the light of the proposal by hasegawa and nyu @xcite regarding `` eigenvalue communication '' , in which the information may be transmitted by higher - order solitons and a recent one sugested by jakubowski , steiglitz and squiev @xcite on nontrivial information transmission system , which uses the more general two - soliton solution of the manakov system @xcite derived by radhakrishnan , lakshmanan and hietarinta in @xcite .",
    "we also find that the hamiltonian of the present integrable model is associated with a non - canonical poisson bracket ( pb ) structure .",

    "the basic evolution equation with cubic - quintic nonlinearity which describes the soliton evolution in non - kerr media with parabolic nonlinearity is discussed in sec - ii .",
    "sections iii is devoted to the proposed model and presents its integrability property by explicit construction of the lax pair as well as the hierarchy of conserved quantities generated through a recurrence relation , which in turn is derived from a coupled ricatti equation using the lax operator .",

    "v we give another evidence of its integrability by relating system ( [ new ] ) to the integrable manakov model through a gauge transformation of the pair ( 11 ) to the manakov lax operators .",
    "integrable systems , as is well known , possess infinite number of conserved quantities in involution , of which usually the lower ones are of physical importance .",
    "explicit forms of such conserved quantities for the integrable system ( [ new ] ) can be derived from a recurrence relation obtained from the ricatti equation related to the lax operator . for this purpose",

    "the above conserved quantities in ( [ c1]- ) may be interpreted in terms of the number operator @xmath89 , the total momentum @xmath90 and the total energy or the hamiltonian of the system @xmath91 .",
    "however it is intriguing to remark that since here the fields @xmath92 do not have canonical poisson bracket relations some care has to be taken in deriving the equation of motion ( [ new ] ) from the hamiltonian ( ) . in fact the poisson bracket structures of the fields , which are derived in sec v , show an interesting anyon - like feature .",
    "the proposed system ( [ new ] ) with quintic nonlinearity allows exact @xmath89-soliton solutions , which can be found for example by hirota s method following the same procedure as in the manakov model .",
    "however a more direct and convenient way is to use the known solutions of the manakov model ( [ manakov ] ) themselves for constructing the soliton solutions of ( [ new ] ) .",
    "this is possible due to the interrelation between these two models , which will be established in the next section .",

    "the plane wave like character in the manakov model has been deformed into a wave suffering compression and rarification of the phases in a kink - like profile ( see fig .",
    "this shows that the effect of quintic nonlinearity of our model appears in the soliton phases and therefore in the derivatives of the soliton profile @xmath96 which must also change the momentum and energy of the soliton .    now exploiting the higher - soliton solutions of the manakov model",
    "it is also possible to find higher - solitons for ( ) in explicit form .",
    "the manakov model ( [ manakov ] ) has received considerable attention in recent years @xcite in order to understand the soliton collision in birerefringent fiber . however",
    "the importance of finding higher - soliton solutions in explicit form has been understood only quite recently @xcite . by constructing the most general two - soliton solution of the integrable manakov model ,",
    "two of the authors ( r.r and m.l ) and hietarinta@xcite have shown that the soliton in birefringent fiber can in general change its shape after interaction due to an intensity redistribution among the modes , eventhough the total intensity remains conserved .",
    "this shape changing collision arising essentially due to the change in polarisation angle helps to realise the exciting possibility of switching between components .",
    "( however , the standard shape - preserving collision property of the ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional soliton system is recoverd , when restrictions are imposed on some of the free parameters in the two - soliton solution @xcite ) . recently using the shape changing collision concept , jakubowski , steiglitz and squier @xcite",
    "have designed sequences of solitons operating on other sequences of solitons that effect logic operations and suggested nontrivial information transformation system .    now in order to investigate the implication of this property of soliton when the additional cubic and quintic nonlinear terms are included , we construct the two - soliton solution of the system ( [ new ] ) and expect again a non - trivial change in the soliton phase as in the case of 1-soliton solution .",
    "such a two - soliton solution expressed compactly through that of the manakov system ( [ manakov ] ) @xmath97 takes the form ( see eq.(24 ) below ) @xmath98 where a general two - soliton solution@xcite of the manakov model is given by @xmath99 in which @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "the six arbitrary complex parameters @xmath111 and @xmath112 determine the amplitude , velocity and phase of the asymptotic soliton .",
    "as we have detected already , we see also here that the two - soliton solution ( 19 ) of ( [ new ] ) differs from that of the manakov model in phase - terms in a nontrivial way . clearly , the phase change depends on the values of the real free parameters @xmath113 and @xmath114 and vanishes for the trivial choice giving back the manakov soliton .",

    "this can be directly studied using the two - soliton solution ( 19 - 20 ) parallel to the procedure of the manakov model given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in order to answer the above question",
    ", we have plotted pictures of soliton collision corresponding to the function @xmath116 instead of @xmath117 since due to @xmath118 = @xmath119 one has to look into the derivatives of the fields , where the effect of phase terms are reflected . for comparing with the pure manakov model",

    "the change in shape disappears if we apply the elastic collision ( shape - preserving collision ) condition , namely @xmath127 by following the work of @xcite . in figs . 2 - 3 , as mentioned",
    ", there is a splitting in each of the asymptotic profiles which appear before and after interaction .",

    "the corresponding interaction profile of the solitons during their propagation is shown in fig .",
    "we observe firstly that , as in the case of manakov model , here also generically the fascinating shape changing inelastic collision persists .",
    "however , in this case one can overcome the splitting effect of figs . 2 - 3 corresponding to the manakov model .",
    "for example , if we set @xmath139 , in ( 19 ) then the splitting of solitons disappear , as evident from figs . 4 - 5 .",
    "the reason for this is that now we have @xmath140 where @xmath141 and @xmath142 are equal to @xmath143 and @xmath144 for @xmath145 , while to @xmath146 and @xmath147 for @xmath148 .",
    "since here the second term dominates over the first in the region of splitting , the splitting effect naturally gets supressed . comparing figs . 3 and 5 it is also important to note that the intensity of solitons ( @xmath149 , @xmath144 , @xmath146 and @xmath65 appearing in eq.([new ] ) .",
    "as we have mentioned above there exists an interesting interrelation between the quintic generalization ( ) and the manakov model ( [ manakov ] ) , which in fact we have used already in deriving the soliton solutions of ( ) .",
    "we establish now this relationship by showing that the lax operators of these two models are related through a local gauge transformation 29,30,31 , while the fields are connected by a nonlinear transformation in dependent variables .",

    "we have seen that for obtaining ( ) from the hamiltonian ( ) we have to use noncanonical brackets ( ) .",
    "on the other hand if nevertheless one considers them to be canonical , i.e. \\{q_i(x ) , q^*_j ( y)}=(x - y ) _",
    "ij ,  \\{q_i(x ) , q_j ( y)}=0 , from the same hamiltonian ( ) we can derive completely different coupled equations with fifth - degree nonlinearity . if for simplicity we assume @xmath163 , we can derive these equations easily from @xmath164 as iq_1z+q_1tt+ 2 ( |q_1|^2 +    ( |q_1|^2+|q_2|^2)q_1t+(q_1^*q_1t+q_2^*q_2t)q_1 ) = 0 and similarly for @xmath165 by interchanging the indices @xmath166 in ( ) .",
    "we notice that this system of coupled equations again with cubic - quintic nonlinearity is a new system which is different from eq .",
    "( ) presented earlier . to anlyse these equations more closely we perform again a nonlinear variable change as @xmath167 with @xmath168 .",
    "after some lenghty but simple manipulations one can reduce the system ( ) further to a more compact form with only cubic nonlinearity : iq_az+q_att+2(n-_0 j ) q_a=0 , where we have denoted @xmath169 we immediately recognize that this is nothing but the vector generalization of the aglietti et al equation jakiw , however with the addition of a cubic nonlinearity coming from the manakov model .",
    "nevertheless the system ( ) shows remarkable property close to the chiral - soliton feature of jakiw .",
    "in particular assuming the 1-soliton form as @xmath170 one may conclude that here the quantity @xmath171 acts as the effective coupling constant of the nonlinear term , which regulates the intensity of the soliton .",
    "therefore for the soliton velocity @xmath172 only ( with @xmath173 ) manakov model like bright solitary wave solution can exist . with decreasing velocity the effective coupling",
    "constant @xmath174 also decreases , which interestingly influences the intensity of the soliton to increase and reflects a possible nonintegrable property of the model . finally for the soliton velocity @xmath175 the nonlinear term to sustain the soliton disappears and hence no such soliton can appear anymore .",
    "however for the negative velocity below this value , @xmath176 the sign of @xmath174 flips and kink - like exact dark soliton can appear . for @xmath177",
    "the whole picture reverts .",
    "this amazing solitonic feature evidently is a generalization of the chiral soliton property of jakiw due to the presence of manakov term as well as the multi - component nature and may have important applications in nonlinear optics .",
    "the suspected nonintegrable nature of this system and consequently the original chiral - solitonic system jakiw can be convincingly proved by showing that the conserved quantities of the model are not in involution ( in particular using the canonical bracket ( ) it can be shown that @xmath178 ) . therefore though this system possesses lax pair and infinite conserved quantities , their noninvolutiveness spoils the integrability .",
    "the involution of the conserved quantities however is restored if we use the noncanonical bracket ( ) and this ensures the exact integrability of ( ) .",
    "we have constructed the lax pair of the proposed integrable cnls equation ( [ new ] ) with cubic - quintic nonlinearity governing the soliton propagation in non - kerr media , and using it generated the infinite set of its conserved quantities in explicit form .",
    "we also presented the exact one and two - soliton solutions of the model using those of the well known manakov model .",
    "it has been demonstrated through the explicit two - soliton solution of the proposed model that the intensity of the t - derivative of soliton in the interaction region is much higher than that of the manakov model .",
    "moreover , the localized part of the time derivative of the manakov soliton gets splitted and peaks around two values as shown in figs 2 and 3 .",
    "however , such splitting can be suppressed in the generalized cubic - quintic equation ( [ new ] ) having nonzero @xmath52 s and @xmath179 s as has been demonstrated in figs . 4 and 5 .",
    "these figures also confirm that the shape changing inelastic soliton collisions , as in the manakov case , persist in our model .",
    "we believe that our results will be found equally useful in more general situations like eq .",
    "( 5 ) by taking our model as the unperturbed part and treating the remaining terms as perturbations .",
    "we have also established the relationship between the proposed model and the manakov model at the lax pair level as well as at the field solution level , which shows an intriguing change in the canonical structure , namely the bosonic relations of manakov model transforms into the anyonic relations of the present system .",
    "another remarkable fact is that assuming the standard canonical structure for our fields we are able to derive from the same hamiltonian yet another coupled system with cubic - quintic nonlinearity .",
    "this novel model , which turns out to be nonintegrable , represents a vector generalization of aglietti et al model , famous for exhibiting chiral - soliton solutions .",
    "such chiral - soliton property also prevails in the present vector case showing fascinating properties of the solitons , like changing intensity with soliton velocity , vanishing of bright solitons and appearance of dark solitons below certain velocity etc .",
    "such properties may have important applications in nonlinear optical processes .",
