    "it is well known that the presence of weak quenched disorder in a ferromagnetic system can essentially modify its critical properties in the vicinity of the phase transition point such that new universal critical exponents may set in @xcite . on the other hand in recent years",
    "it is argued that due to the presence of disorder the statistical properties of some thermodynamical quantities at the critical point can become non - self - averaging @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present study is to demonstrate that due to the presence of weak disorder the statistics of the free energy fluctuations in the critical point of the ising ferromagnet is described by a nontrivial universal distribution function .",
    "away from the critical point at scales much bigger than the correlation length @xmath2 the situation is sufficiently simple : here the system could be considered as a set of essentially independent regions with the size @xmath2 , and for that reason one could naively expect that the free energy distribution function must be gaussian . in fact , besides the central gaussian part ( the  body \" ) this distribution has asymmetric and essentially non - gaussian tails @xcite . approaching the critical point",
    "one finds that the range of validity of the gaussian body shrinks while the tails are getting of the same order as the body . finally , when the correlation length becomes of the order of the system size ( in the critical point ) the free energy distribution function turns into a universal curve .",
    "present investigation of the critical free energy fluctuations is performed in terms of the renormalized replica ginzburg - landau hamiltonian in dimensions @xmath0 which allows to derive the explicit expression for their probability distribution function ( pdf ) . in particular , using known fixed - point values for the renormalized coupling parameters we obtain the universal curve for such pdf in the dimension @xmath1 ( eq.([18 ] ) , figure [ figure1 ] ) .",
