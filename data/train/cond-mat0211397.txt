    "with the rapid development of the high - density information storage device , the control of grain size and grain size distribution in magnetic thin films will be required for the next generation of information storage technology , where the drive for decreased media noise and increased storage density is pushing the grain size below the 10 nm regime.@xcite present technology involves the deposition of co rich magnetic phases onto seed layers whose grain size determines the grain size of the magnetic layer through grain to grain epitaxy .",
