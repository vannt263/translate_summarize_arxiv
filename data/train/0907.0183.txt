    "the large area telescope aboard the fermi gamma - ray space telescope ( _ fermi _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will measure for the first time the all - sky gamma - ray emission at energies from a few tens of gev to a few hundred gev , an energy band which is especially promising for indirect dark matter searches .",
    "a generic prediction of cold dark matter models is the persistence of substructure within dark matter halos .",
    "depending on the details of the particle physics model , the smallest dark matter halos form in the early universe with masses of @xmath0 ",
    "@xmath1 m@xmath2 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and many of these dense halos are expected to survive to the present day .",
    "this prediction is consistent with the results of numerical simulations , which find an abundance of subhalos within a galaxy - sized dark matter halo .",
    "simulations also find that the radial distribution of subhalos is less centrally concentrated than the smooth dark matter of the host halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and consequently the angular distribution of galactic subhalos on the sky as observed from our position appears fairly isotropic @xcite , as shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : maps ] .",
    "the rate of dark matter annihilation scales with the square of the density , so nearby regions of high density , such as the galactic center and subhalos , are natural targets for indirect searches . while the galactic center is almost certainly the brightest point source of gamma - rays from dark matter , substantial astrophysical foregrounds make extracting a dark matter signal from the galactic center a formidable challenge .",
    "subhalos , on the other hand , are largely free of such foregrounds , and although most subhalos in the halo of the milky way are not likely to be resolved individually as point sources by _ fermi _ @xcite , collectively substructure is expected to generate a large flux of diffuse gamma - rays , exceeding the smooth halo flux for angles @xmath3 10 degrees from the galactic center @xcite .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : maps ] shows a realization of the signal from substructure as observed by an experiment with the angular resolution of _ fermi _ above @xmath4 gev .",
    "the ` isotropic ' diffuse gamma - ray background thus may include contributions from galactic dark matter substructure and extragalactic dark matter , as well as from unresolved members of known extragalactic source classes such as blazars . since most of the measured dark matter flux may be hidden in diffuse emission ,",
    "it is worthwhile to explore methods for robustly extracting this signal . recognizing that different source classes have different anisotropy properties , several recent studies have considered anisotropies in diffuse emission on small angular scales as a way of statistically identifying contributions from distinct source classes .",
    "angular power spectra of the gamma - ray emission from several extragalactic source classes @xcite as well as from galactic dark matter @xcite have been predicted .    in this paper , i review recent theoretical work related to anisotropy analysis of gamma - ray data , however the content presented is based primarily on @xcite and @xcite . in section  2",

    "the angular power spectrum provides a statistical measure of fluctuations as a function of angular scale .",
    "here i consider the angular power spectrum @xmath6 of intensity fluctuations @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the intensity in the direction @xmath9 .",
    "note that the fluctuations are expressed in units of the mean map intensity , hence @xmath10 is dimensionless .",
    "the angular power spectrum is given by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 are determined by expanding @xmath13 in spherical harmonics , @xmath14 .",
    "for an unclustered distribution of point sources ( i.e. , a distribution for which the angular position of a given source is uncorrelated with the position of the other sources ) , the angular power spectrum is noise - like . in this case , @xmath6 takes the same value at all @xmath15 , and is inversely proportional to the number density of sources per solid angle .",
    "blazars are point sources and only weakly clustered , hence their angular power spectrum is well - approximated as noise - like ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "most galactic subhalos are point - like due to the extremely small angular size of their emission region , and from our position do not appear strongly clustered , so galactic dark matter substructure also produces a fairly noise - like power spectrum .",
    "however , subhalos which are sufficiently massive or nearby are extended sources , and their contribution results in relatively less angular power at high multipoles ( corresponding to small angular scales ) compared to a pure noise - like source distribution . in general , the amplitude of the angular power spectrum from galactic substructure is predicted to be much greater than that from blazars .",
    "this can be understood by noting that as a cosmological source class , blazars have a much higher number density per solid angle than galactic substructure , and thus produce less angular power .",
    "figure  [ fig : powerspect ] shows the angular power spectrum from galactic substructure for subhalo populations which extend to a minimum subhalo mass @xmath16 m@xmath2 and @xmath17 m@xmath2 , and for the smooth dark matter halo . in the small @xmath18 scenario , the angular power spectrum is quite noise - like , reflecting that most of the emission is from subhalos that are effectively point sources . for the large @xmath18 case",
    "the angular power spectrum is flatter because more of the emission originates from extended sources .",
    "the overall normalization of the power spectrum is higher in the @xmath17 m@xmath2 case since the mean map intensity is smaller , and thus the same intensity fluctuation is a larger fractional deviation from the mean than in the @xmath16 m@xmath2 case . due to its small contribution to the total intensity , the smooth halo contributes minimally to the total angular power .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that because the angular power spectra shown are calculated in units of the mean intensity of each source class , to compare the contributions of these source classes to the total angular power spectrum the individual power spectra must be scaled by the fractional contribution of the intensity of that source class squared .",

    "i consider only these two source classes , as they are expected to be the most relevant for analysis of the diffuse gamma - ray background with _",
    "in this section i present two example scenarios that demonstrate that the energy dependence of the angular power spectrum of the total measured emission could be used to confidently infer the presence of multiple contributing source populations . in these examples",
    "i assume that the total measured isotropic diffuse emission is comprised exclusively of emission from unresolved blazars and from galactic dark matter substructure . for cosmological source populations such as blazars , at energies above a few tens of gev interactions with the uv , optical , and ir backgrounds ( the extragalactic background light , ebl ) lead to an exponential cutoff in the observed intensity energy spectrum , so for the blazar spectra ebl attenuation is approximated here by applying an energy - dependent cut - off , and assuming for simplicity that all blazars reside at a single redshift .",
    "the dark matter intensity energy spectrum is calculated using the approximation given in @xcite .",
    "the angular power spectrum of the total diffuse emission from extragalactic sources @xmath19 and galactic dark matter substructure @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the ( energy - dependent ) fractions of the total emission from extragalactic sources and galactic dark matter substructure , respectively .",
    "extragalactic sources and galactic dark matter substructure are uncorrelated , so here the cross - correlation term @xmath24 . as evident from eq .",
    "[ eq : clsum ] , the amplitude of the total angular power spectrum at a given energy depends on the relative contributions of each source class to the measured emission at that energy . for clarity ,",
    "i use the term intensity energy spectrum to describe the energy dependence of the photon intensity .",
    "the anisotropy energy spectrum is defined as the value of the angular power spectrum at a fixed multipole @xmath15 as a function of energy .",
    "the angular power spectrum of a single source class in which all members have the same intensity energy spectrum is independent of energy because the angular distribution of the sources on the sky is identical at all energies .",
    "however , contributions to the diffuse emission from multiple populations with different intensity energy spectra result in a modulation of the anisotropy energy spectrum , as the relative contribution of each population changes with energy .    figures  [ fig : aniso1 ] and  [ fig : aniso2 ] present the intensity energy spectra and corresponding anisotropy energy spectra at @xmath25 for two example scenarios . in each scenario",
    "the intensity energy spectrum of the total measured diffuse emission is consistent with that of an unresolved blazar population plus a dark matter component , but also with that of an unresolved blazar population with slightly different spectral properties without a dark matter component . in these cases",
    "spectral information alone is insufficient to identify the dark matter signal , however , the anisotropy energy spectrum can be used to robustly identify the presence of a dark matter contribution . in both examples the observed ` total ' intensity energy spectra and anisotropy energy spectra are the sum of the dark matter and the ebl - attenuated reference blazar contributions .",
    "the intensity energy spectrum of an alternative blazar model is also shown which , with ebl attenuation , could plausibly produce the observed total intensity energy spectrum without a dark matter component .    the scenario in figure",
    "[ fig : aniso1 ] assumes a dark matter mass of 700 gev , and despite dark matter dominating the total intensity above @xmath5 20 gev , its contribution is not clearly identifiable in the intensity energy spectrum . in the anisotropy energy spectrum ,",

    "[ fig : aniso2 ] the dark matter mass is assumed to be 80 gev , and here dark matter never dominates the intensity energy spectrum , but still produces a strong feature in the anisotropy energy spectrum . in both examples",
    "the anisotropy energy spectrum enables the blazar plus dark matter scenario to be distinguished from a blazar - only scenario : if unresolved blazars were the sole source of the isotropic diffuse emission , the anisotropy energy spectrum would be constant in energy , but the presence of a dark matter contribution results in a modulation in the anisotropy energy spectrum , unambiguously indicating a change in contributing source populations with energy .    in these figures",
    "the error bars indicate the @xmath26 statistical uncertainty in the measured angular power spectrum for an all - sky observation time of 5 years with _ fermi _ , assuming a fraction @xmath27 of the sky over which the analysis is performed .",
    "the @xmath26 uncertainty is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the angular power spectrum of the signal ( here , @xmath30 ) and @xmath31 is the window function of a gaussian beam of width @xmath32 , which here corresponds to _ fermi s _ angular resolution .",

    "unresolved blazars and galactic dark matter substructure are considered signal , while any other observed emission , such as galactic sources other than substructure , are noise .",
    "the error bars shown generously assume @xmath38 , i.e. , an order of magnitude more background than signal photons .    for the anisotropy energy spectrum at @xmath25 , the error bars rapidly increase at low energies ( @xmath39 gev ) due to the degradation of _ fermi s _ angular resolution below this energy , and at high energies due to low photon statistics .",
    "at intermediate energies the noise term in eq .",
    "[ eq : deltacl ] ( @xmath40 ) is quite small , and in this regime a modulation in the measured anisotropy energy spectrum can be easily identified .",

    "anisotropies in diffuse gamma - ray emission can be a powerful diagnostic of the properties of contributing source populations .",

    "the robustness of anisotropy analysis can be improved by examining the energy dependence of anisotropies , since the angular power spectrum of the total measured emission varies with energy according to the energy - dependent contribution of each source population .",
    "the examples presented in section  3 demonstrate that a contribution from galactic dark matter substructure to the measured diffuse emission leads to a departure of the anisotropy energy spectrum from an energy - invariant quantity .",
