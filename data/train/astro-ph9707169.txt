    "the measure of galaxy number counts and the study of the spectrophotometric properties of faint galaxies are probably the two leading topics to constrain the evolutionary history of galaxies , a point which is absolutely needed in cosmology .",
    "the new observational tools coming from hst imagery surveys , deep number magnitude counts in different wavelengths and spectroscopic surveys of faint galaxies have allowed to approach the spectromorphological evolution of galaxies in a reliable way . for the first time , some clues have been proposed to explain the nature of the faint blue galaxies and to determine the star formation history ( see the review by @xcite and @xcite ) . nevertheless , it is still difficult to estimate the rate at which this evolution occurs as well as the physical processes involved , because number counts are integrated values over the redshift distribution and the luminosity distribution of galaxies .",
    "spectroscopic surveys in deep fields are one of the issues to treat the problem , but they are limited in magnitude .",
    "for example , the surveys up to the limit @xmath1 ( @xcite , @xcite ) show a peak at @xmath2 , but the lack of a large number of high redshift objects in these surveys argues for a mild luminosity evolution at intermediate redshift . from a deep sample of @xmath3-band selected galaxies ,",
    "the canada france redshift survey ( cfrs , @xcite ) reveals an evolution in the luminosity function ( lf ) of the bluer field galaxies of about 1 magnitude between @xmath4 and @xmath5 but again fails to identify a population of high-@xmath6 galaxies .",
    "spectroscopic data acquired by the autofib redshift survey ( @xcite ) leads to similar conclusions about the evolution of the luminosity function with redshift and show also a clear steepening in the faint end slope of the lf .",
    "a powerful way to investigate higher redshifts with the same magnitude limit is possible thanks to the gravitational magnification of background sources in the field of massive clusters of galaxies ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "serendipitously lensed by a foreground cluster , gravitational arcs and arclets are representative of a rather distant population of galaxies , at least up to a redshift @xmath7 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , or even higher in a few cases ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "but again the magnitude limitation for spectroscopy prevents an extensive and deep analysis .",
    "photometric identification of very high redshift objects has also proved very successful in the case of multiple images lensed by a massive cluster of galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . to overcome the difficulty , several approaches are proposed , each of them being based on a redshift estimate for individual arclets .",
    "a promising one is the lens inversion technique which consists in finding the most probable redshift for each arclet depending on its location and shape parameters for a given lens model of the cluster potential ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "successfully used in a few cases , it allows to reach intrinsic magnitudes up to @xmath8 27 .",
    "the redshift distribution of gravitational arclets can also be estimated with multicolor photometry ( @xcite ) , thanks to the photometric redshift estimated from a long wavelength baseline ( from u to k ) .",
    "a more straightforward method consists in measuring the depletion in counts of arclets caused by the amplification bias : depending on the slope of the field galaxies number counts , the radial density of arclets will show a depletion curve characteristic of the sources redshift ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the drawing of the critical lines corresponding to the most distant galaxies was also proposed as a sub - product of this method and could be used to constrain the redshift of formation of the galaxies .",
    "the aim of the paper is to probe the spectrophotometric evolution of galaxies by computing both the number counts of arclets behind a cluster - lens and their redshift distribution .",
    "the basic idea is to consider cluster - lenses as `` high-@xmath6 filters '' which select background galaxies and distort them , making their shape easier to identify .",
    "so the sample of arclets is a subsample of a global sample of faint field galaxies in which galaxy evolution at relatively large look - back times may be much stronger .",
    "the deep number counts of arclets are then supposed to probe more directly the redshift distribution of _ distant _ galaxies and their relative weight with respect to a possible population of faint nearby galaxies .",
    "previous statistical studies about the occurence rate of arcs or arclets assumed spherical potential for all clusters and/or neglected galaxy evolution ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . the authors were more concerned about constraining the mass profile of the lenses , whereas in this paper we want to emphasize the implications on galaxy evolution . for this reason",
    ", we apply our models on real cluster - lenses ( abell 370 and abell 2218 ) for which the presence of multiple - images strongly constrains the potential in the cluster core . moreover in order to optimise the arclets identification among the crowded cluster fields , we use deep hst images available for both clusters .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in section 2 , we compute the number counts of gravitational arclets by combining models of spectrophotometric evolution of galaxies , which reproduce the field number - counts , and realistic models of mass distribution for clusters , which are well constrained by multiple images and giant arcs .",
    "the sensitivity of our model with respect to uncertainties on the lensing potential at large radii is tested , and the robustness of the results with respect to some observational criteria such as axis ratio or surface brightness is explored .",
    "section 3 presents the results obtained with this method on two cluster - lenses , a2218 and a370 , including a comparison between the predicted number counts of arclets and the observed ones .",
    "the sensitivity of our model to different parameters is discussed in section 4 , and some clues about the possibility to detect high - z galaxies are also considered . finally , conclusions are presented in section 5 .    throughout the paper , we consider a hubble constant of h@xmath9 , with @xmath10 .",
    "the surface density of gravitational arclets obeys to two competing effects : one is the magnification of the luminosity by the cluster potential and the other one is surface dilution . if @xmath11 is the surface density of galaxies up to magnitude @xmath12 with slope @xmath13 , the density of arclets magnified by a factor @xmath14 is @xmath15 hence , @xmath16 the dominating effect depends on the slope of number counts in empty fields without magnification by an intervening mass . for steep counts ( @xmath17 ) , gravitational lensing will increase the surface density whereas for shallower counts a depletion will take place ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    looking in details at the number counts behind a cluster - lens , we can write the number of arclets brighter than magnitude @xmath12 with an axis ratio greater than @xmath18 and a surface brigthness brighter than @xmath19 within a given region of the sky as : @xmath20 the summation is over the different morphological types and @xmath21 is the lens redshift .",
    "@xmath22 is the redshift cutoff corresponding to the limit in central surface brightness @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath23 is the angular area in the source plane ( at redshift @xmath6 ) filled by sources corresponding to arclets with an axis ratio between @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 is the lf at redshift @xmath6 for each morphological type .",
    "@xmath27 is the luminosity of an object at redshift @xmath6 which has an apparent magnitude @xmath12 after magnification by the cluster , assuming that the source is circular and that its axis ratio is a after magnification ( see below in  2.3 ) .",
    "finally , @xmath28 is the bright end of the lf and @xmath29 is the volume element .",
    "the main differences with standard number counts are : firstly , the integration in redshift runs from the lens - redshift @xmath21 as a minimum up to a limit which depends essentially on the limitation in surface brightness @xmath22 .",
    "gravitational lensing preserves the surface brightness of the sources , so a cut in observed surface brigthness is more realistic than a cut in magnitude for extended objects .",
    "secondly , one has to take into account the differential observed surface , computed in the source plane for each redshift and for each magnification .",
    "finally , each luminosity has to be corrected from the magnification before the integration over the lf of the sources , as well as the minimum limit in luminosity .",
    "an additional application is to compute local values of the different parameters to derive the 2d projected number density and the mean redshift of arclets ( see  3.6 ) .    in order to validate this computation of number counts",
    ", we check first in the following section that observations in empty fields are correctly reproduced by the evolution model .",
    "we then present how to include a mass model in the problem , and the way both models are combined .",
    "we finally investigate the sensivity of counts to these mass distributions .",

    "moreover , density evolution can occur due to the addition of a population of dwarf objects at low redshift or to an earlier phase of merging .",
    "a change in the overall density is not required in a low @xmath46 universe but it is necessary in a closed universe to reproduce number counts ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we consider here two different models , which correspond to these two cases :    * model 1 : @xmath30=0 , with a constant schechter function , which is a pure luminosity evolution model . *",

    "model 2 produces more faint objects at high redshift than model 1 , a trend which is consistent with the results of the autofib redshift survey ( @xcite ) . nevertheless , this qualitative model is somewhat unrealistic because the photometric properties induced by merging are not investigated in details . in any case ,",
    "model 2 is a useful approach to the @xmath39 scenario in view of the high @xmath54 values found in weak lensing analysis ( see @xcite for a review ) which seem to reject a low @xmath46 universe .",
    "finally , the number counts of arcs and arclets are limited to redshifts higher than the lens redshift , and they are mainly sensitive to rather bright objects , even at the faintest magnitudes . for this reason , these counts do not depend severely on the uncertainties on the faint end slope of the local lf .",
    "as the detection of extended objects is highly dependent on surface brightness , we include this effect in the models .",
    "we assign a gaussian distribution of central surface brightness in @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) to each morphological type .",
    "the parameters defining these observed distributions in the local universe have been taken from the literature ( all the units are in @xmath57 ) :    * e : @xmath58 , @xmath59 ( @xcite ) * s0 , sa , sb and sc : @xmath60 @xmath61 , @xmath62 ( @xcite ) * sd and i m : @xmath60 @xmath63 , @xmath64 ( @xcite )    the evolution of @xmath56 with @xmath6 obeys to the standard relationship : @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are computed with the bruzual & charlot code .",
    "when no other value is indicated , the surface brightness limit for the detection is 28 @xmath57 in @xmath55 , a value which is close to the @xmath68 detection level in most cases considered here . at redshift @xmath6 and for each morphological type and magnitude ,",
    "a visibility weight is introduced according to the above surface brightness distributions to compute the total fraction of objects actually detected .    on ground - based images , the seeing spreads the light coming from the center of the objects .",
    "for number counts of arcs and arclets , the effect of seeing is also important because it modifies the shapes of the images ( see details in  2.3 and  2.4 ) .",
    "several effects should be considered to properly take into account the results of seeing on galaxy profiles and to include an observational cut in surface brightness . in principle , the luminosity profile for each morphological type defines a characteristic radius which is related to the total luminosity of the galaxy , @xmath69 .",
    "this characteristic angular radius @xmath70 is then convolved with the seeing to give an _ observed _ central surface brightness @xmath71 .",
    "a cut in @xmath71 induces a maximum redshift at which the galaxy can be observed .",
    "this effect is minor for elliptical galaxies because @xmath72 provided that the surface brightness limit is faint enough , but it should be much more sensitive for spirals .",
    "we have adopted here the crude weighting described above , as a function of @xmath71 , and the selection is often performed on wfpc hst images , where these seeing effects are negligible in practice .",
    "a more realistic treatment of source profiles will require a fair knowledge of the morphological evolution of galaxies , taking into account that morphology is expected to be strongly wavelength dependent .",
    "the predictions of field number counts in the @xmath55-band are presented in figure [ fig - comptesb ] , and the corresponding redshift distributions are shown in figure [ fig - redshiftb ] .",
    "all these calculations were performed without seeing .",
    "observed number counts are taken from the compilation by metcalfe et al .",
    "( 1991 ) of various works .",
    "the counts at faint magnitudes were obtained by williams et al .",
    "( 1996 ) from the hubble deep field survey .",
    "when we introduce a seeing of @xmath73 and a more accurate treatement of galaxy profiles , only a slight difference appears for the faintest bin in magnitude , where the counts are reduced to @xmath74 of their value without seeing .",
    "we also checked that number counts in filters @xmath41 and @xmath3 were correctly reproduced as well as the redshift distribution of galaxies selected in @xmath3 ( @xmath75 ) according to the cfrs ( @xcite ) .",
    "infrared counts in the @xmath42-band are somewhat more discrepant and show an underestimate of the counts predicted at faint magnitudes .",
    "an accurate modelling of the mass distribution in the lens is needed because , in principle , any variation in the local substructures or in the slope of the potential may induce a change in the local magnification and axis ratio of the background galaxies .",
    "steep surface mass density profiles will produce arclets narrower than a more gradual slope ( @xcite ) .",
    "for this reason , the model is applied in the first place to two well studied cluster - lenses , using the published lens models : a370 at @xmath76 ( @xcite ) and a2218 at @xmath77 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "both clusters are very well represented by bimodal cluster - scale mass distributions , with the clumps being centered on the two main galaxies and the potentials modelled by pseudo isothermal elliptical distributions ( piemd , @xcite ) . in the improved modelling for a2218 ( @xcite ) ,",
    "the authors introduce an additional galaxy - scale component in the mass distribution .",
    "each one of the 34 brightest cluster galaxies is modelled by a pseudo  isothermal elliptical mass distribution with the parameters ( truncation radius , core radius and velocity dispersion ) scaled to the galaxy luminosity . the effect on number counts of uncertainties in the mass distribution",
    "is quantified below ( see  2.5 ) .",
    "the axis ratio of an arclet is the result of the intrinsic size of the source , tangential and radial magnifications and seeing .",
    "the images from the medium deep survey ( the mds project ) show that the intrinsic size of galaxies seems rather constant until @xmath78 ( @xcite ) . on the contrary , the results of lens inversion based on hst images ( scanning higher redshift galaxies ) lead to the conclusion that the half light radius of the sources of giant gravitational arcs is decreasing with increasing redshift following approximately the law @xmath79 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this effect is relevant in the merging hypothesis and implies lower dimensions for high redshift objects .",
    "we include the decreasing law as an additive hypothesis in models 1b and 2b , for @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively .",
    "the evolution of the linear size then follows the relation @xmath80 scaled with the average half light radius of nearby spiral galaxies ( 8.7 kpc , @xcite ) , and also in good agreement with the typical sizes observed for the most distant galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "models 1a and 2a are the equivalent ones with a constant linear size of 8.7 kpc , whatever the redshift .    all sources are considered circular because it is not worth introducing an ellipticity distribution when we are only interested in arclets with rather high axis ratio ( @xmath81 ) , and when the intrinsic ellipticity of sources is negligible compared to the one induced by the lens . however , we are aware of the higher importance of source ellipticities in weak lensing studies , when reconstructing mass profiles .",
    "hence the observed axis ratio is : @xmath82 @xmath83 and @xmath84 being the tangential and radial magnification , @xmath85 the half light angular radius and @xmath86 the seeing or the width of the psf .",
    "@xmath87 in equation 3 is the background surface at redshift @xmath6 where the sources have an axis ratio between @xmath24 and @xmath88 after magnification .",
    "it is a specific term related to lensing and magnification , which makes the arclet number counts quite different from results in empty fields .",
    "numerically , @xmath87 is obtained by computing the area in the image plane where arclets with @xmath89 can be found , and then dividing by the magnification at each point because of the dilution factor in the image plane . the upper limit chosen for the magnification is 20 , a value representative of giant arcs , but of negligible effect because statistics is not dominated by giant arcs . in practice ,",
    "as number counts will be computed in the image plane , we have chosen to scan this plane with a grid of 1  step and then to relate these image elements to the corresponding surface in the source plane at each redshift .    in the case of a circular potential , two arclets at the same redshift with the same axis ratio would have identical magnifications .",
    "but the link between the axis ratio and the magnification of an arclet is not unique in the more realistic cases considered in this paper ( bimodal potentials , perturbing galaxies ) .",
    "figure [ fig - axes2218 ] illustrates this effect on the relationship between axis ratio and magnification , for a realistic set of parameters in the cluster - lens a2218 , compared to the results expected when the potential corresponds to a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) . in practice , to compute the intrinsic magnitude of an arclet at redshift @xmath6 and with an axis ratio between @xmath24 and @xmath88 , the net magnification by the cluster was assumed to be the averaged magnification factor for all the arclets with the same axis ratio and redshift .",
    "the effect of the finite size of sources was neglected when computing magnifications : in regions close to critical lines the magnification of an extended source is different from that of a point source at the same location , it does not grow to infinity .",
    "indeed , for magnifications smaller than 20 this effect is quite negligible .      in spite of the fact that gravitational lensing does not change the surface brightness , other intervening effects such as atmospheric seeing , optical psf and pixel sampling tend to modify it .",
    "thanks to the magnification , an arclet appears larger than the equivalent unlensed galaxy , and its luminosity profile is stretched while the central surface brightness remains unchanged . hence flattening by",
    "the seeing is less effective for a lensed object than for its source galaxy .",
    "the relevant parameters become the characteristic lengths of the profile along both axis of the arc , enlarged by the convolution with the full psf .",
    "in addition to simple magnification , gravitational lensing makes the detection of faint galaxies easier by increasing their mean surface brightness .",
    "this is even more sensitive for ground - based images ( with seeing @xmath90 1 ) as point sources are much more attenuated by the psf .",
    "this effect can be approximated by considering the change in surface introduced by the seeing : @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the semi major and semi minor axis of the arc and @xmath86 is the seeing fwhm . in the case of hst data , the fwhm is equal to 0.1  although data are undersampled by the pixel size .",
    "of course the result is also sensitive to the way @xmath92 and @xmath93 are measured , the central part being more circular than the limiting isophote after convolution .",
    "we choose here to consider the half light distances in both axis .",
    "a more precise treatment is proposed by hattori et al .",
    "( 1997 ) who consider isophotal magnitudes whereas we are concerned here with total magnitudes , less sensitive to detection conditions . in the following we limit the counts to arcs with central surface brightness @xmath94 or @xmath95 .",
    "we check here the sensitivity of our model to uncertainties on the mass distribution . in particular , we focus on the effects of varying the assumptions for the cluster potential in the two cluster - lenses considered : a2218 and a370 .    as explained in  2.2 , two lens models are available for the cluster a2218 ( @xcite and @xcite ) : the first one with only cluster - scale mass components , and the improved one with 34 additional galaxy - scale components in the mass distribution .",
    "both of them reproduce correctly the observed shear pattern . nevertheless , the second model increases the local magnification and distorts the critical lines in the regions around each lensing galaxy , in such a way that a lensed image located in this area will be divided in 2 or 3 parts whereas the same object would appear as a giant arc with a smoother cluster - scale potential .",
    "hence a higher number of arclets is expected , for a given set of lens parameters ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "an example of such multiplication of arclets is given by the giant arc # 359 at redshift @xmath96 ( according to the numbering scheme of @xcite ) .",
    "introducing the local magnification by the mass of galaxies # 341 and # 373 enabled to identify three other images of this object ( arcs # 328 , # 337 and # 389 ) .",
    "this point is quite crucial in our problem because although they do not dominate the arcs counts , multiple images can distort our statistics of small numbers , at least in a few magnitude bins .",
    "the difference between the expected number counts with these two models , compared to real counts , is shown in figure [ fig - histo2218 ] .    the cluster - scale model of a2218 ( kneib et al .",
    "1995 ) has been used to investigate the influence of uncertainties in the core radii and the velocity dispersions . to summarize ,",
    "when these parameters are modified within reasonable values ( taking model uncertainties into account ) , the net result is only a change in the absolute normalisation of @xmath97 , with no shift in the mean redshift of the sample .",
    "the results are much more sensitive to errors in velocity dispersions than to core radii .",
    "when the core radii varies by 20% , the number of arcs changes by only a 15 % , whereas the total number of arclets is modified by 45% for a small change of 10% in the velocity dispersions .",
    "it is worth noting that such variations in the parameters are far beyond the published uncertainties .",
    "the uncertainty introduced by the slope of the cluster potential in the external part of the deflector , where most of the arclets appear , has also been investigated with the lens model of a370 . in this case , the mass distribution in the central part of the cluster is very well constrained by two systems of multiple images : the giant arc a0 and the pair b2/b3 lead to a bimodal mass distribution with two clumps centered on the cluster galaxies g20 and g35 ( @xcite ) .",
    "hence , we have introduced modifications in the external potential , keeping the center unchanged .",
    "the external region is defined in figure [ fig - potentielhst ] by an ellipse oriented parallel to the line linking the two central galaxies and with a semi major axis of 40 . inside the ellipse",
    "we keep the potential to the expression by kneib et al .",
    "( 1993 ) @xmath98 where g20 and g35 are the main cluster galaxies ( see @xcite ) . outside the ellipse ,",
    "the potential is not bimodal any longer but it follows the same law as for each clump : @xmath99^{\\gamma}$$\\ ] ] in polar coordinates , with @xmath100 .",
    "@xmath101 is the orientation , @xmath102 the ellipticity , @xmath103 the velocity dispersion , @xmath104 the core radius , @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the angular diameter distances respectively between the lens and the source and between the observer and the source .",
    "note that this potential is continuous only along the major axis of the ellipse in figure [ fig - potentielhst ] , but this simplification is only used to test the effects of the slope of the potential on the absolute normalisation of arcs number counts .",
    "outside the ellipse , the parameters of the global potential are @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 @xmath111 to fit the modelling of kneib et al .",
    "the values @xmath112 and @xmath113 have been chosen to provide respectively an underestimate and an overestimate of the surface mass density of about 1/3 at large distance from the center of the cluster ( figure [ fig - potentielprof ] ) .",
    "whatever the model used , the change in the amount of mass in the external parts of the cluster - lens simply scales the total number of arcs seen through a cluster , with a negligible change in the mean redshift of the sample ( _ i.e. _ an overestimate of the total mass , @xmath114=1.1 , increases the number of arclets by 25 % while an underestimate , @xmath114=0.8 , will decrease it by 30 % ) .",
    "more details about the uncertainties induced by the mass modeling are discussed in the next section .",
    "the detection of arclets in the two cluster - lenses was performed in the frame of wfpc2 hst images , obtained from the stsci archives : 5600 sec of exposure in filter f675w for a370 ( p.i . :",
    "r.saglia ) , and 6500 sec of exposure in filter f702w for a2218 ( @xcite ) . the @xmath115 color distribution of arclets in a2218 is also studied below .",
    "blue magnitudes for a2218 were determined from ground - based deep b images obtained a the 3.5 m telescope at calar alto ( @xcite ) . the pixel size was @xmath116 and the seeing was @xmath117 in this case .",
    "the sextractor package ( @xcite ) was used to detect the arclets , with the requirement for an object to have at least 12 contiguous pixels above @xmath68 of the local sky level .",
    "the detection limit at 1@xmath118 above the sky is @xmath119 in a2218 and @xmath120 in a370 .",
    "we limit the sample to objects with total @xmath121 magnitude between 21.5 and 25.5 and axis ratio greater than 2 , the bright end cut is aimed to avoid contamination by cluster members .",
    "a close inspection of each object has been done to eliminate objects with problems in detection or photometry ( close or inside the pc , partially out of field , ... ) , and also those showing position angles outside the range @xmath122 from the predicted local shear .",
    "the final catalog contains 73 objects in a2218 and 81 objets in a370 , the number of objects excluded by weak shear constraints being 2 and 12 respectively .",
    "the observed and predicted number counts of arclets versus r magnitude in a2218 are shown in figure [ fig - histo2218 ] .",
    "the predicted total number of arcs ( @xmath123 and @xmath81 ) with the best mass model is lower than the observed number by a factor of 2 ( table [ tab-2218 ] ) .",
    "similar counts in a370 with @xmath124 and @xmath81 are displayed in figure [ fig - histo370 ] .",
    "again , the models underpredict the observed counts by a factor of @xmath125 at the faintest magnitudes .",
    "the contamination by cluster members is possible , especially for the less elongated objects or the faintest ones .",
    "the number of objects excluded in each cluster allows to estimate this source of contamination , which is unable to explain all the observed excess .",
    "some clues to understand this discrepancy in terms of cosmological parameters , lf and clustering are given in  4 .",
    "ccc mass model&@xmath126&@xmath127 + bimodal ( @xcite)&12.1&5.1 + multimodal ( @xcite)&16.7&7.9 + observed arclets&30&13 +      another test of reliability for these results is to compare the predicted with the expected color distribution of arclets . to do that ,",
    "the evolution with @xmath6 of the color index @xmath115 was computed for the four morphological types of galaxy included in the model .",
    "then , these discrete values were replaced by a gaussian distribution for each type ( @xmath59 mag . ) and the counts in color were computed in the usual way .",
    "these predictions have been compared to the observed values in a2218 .",
    "because of the different detection conditions in the @xmath55band compared to the wfpc2 ( exposure time , seeing , pixel size ) , the resulting catalogue is limited to 49 objects with @xmath128 and @xmath129 , 21 of them at @xmath130 .",
    "the color distribution of arclets in a2218 for @xmath131 and @xmath81 is shown in figure [ fig - color2218 ] .",
    "the observed range of @xmath115 is well reproduced by the models , although the modelled colors tend to be slightly bluer than observed .",
    "this effect is probably due to the way color indices are computed on ccd images : with such different sampling and observing conditions , colors are obtained roughly as the difference between the measured magnitudes , hst magnitudes being total ones while b - magnitudes are isophotal . as isophotal magnitudes tend to be overestimated at faint fluxes ,",
    "the net effect is an artificial reddening of the sample which could explain this small discrepancy .      for a direct comparison with existing deep redshift surveys ,",
    "the redshift distribution of arclets has been computed in both @xmath55 and @xmath121 filters .",
    "these results are shown in figures [ fig - z2218-r ] and [ fig - z2218 ] for a2218 , and in figure [ fig - z370 ] for a370 . in the case of a2218 ,",
    "our results can be partially compared to the results of a successful spectroscopic survey of arclets ( @xcite ) , where 19 redshifts were obtained ranging from @xmath6 = 0.45 to 2.5 , and observed magnitudes from r = 20.0 to r = 23.5 .",
    "this observed distribution peaks to a mean value of @xmath132 , with only two objects at @xmath133 .",
    "figure [ fig - z2218-r ] shows the redshift distribution of arclets expected with the same selection conditions than that adopted by @xcite .",
    "the peak observed is remarkably well reproduced .",
    "however , another population of objects is expected at higher redshifts , @xmath134 , with models 1 and 2 , which is not seen in these data .",
    "this high redshift tail is mainly produced by e type galaxies and it is extremely sensitive to the redshift of formation assumed for the sources and to the hypothesis of no - evolution in morphological types .",
    "the maximum value of n(z ) at @xmath134 is lowered by @xmath135 assuming a redshift of formation @xmath136 , but the distribution extends to higher redshifts keeping the total number of objects approximately constant .",
    "selection biases affecting the spectroscopic sample , the accuracy of the lens model and the effects of clustering behind the lens are discussed below (  4 ) .",
    "we have also tried to compare our model with a larger sample of giant arcs and arclets originating from different clusters ( figure [ fig - zarcs ] ) , from a compilation of all measured redshifts at the present day .",
    "again , in this sample arclets are mostly found between @xmath6=0.5 and 1 , although arcs produced by different mass distributions are mixed and can not be used for a close comparison with figure [ fig - z2218 ] .",
    "this sample is however interesting because it corresponds to arcs with high magnifications so the integrated flux favours the acquisition of better s / n ratio on the continuum of the spectra .",
    "some absorption lines are expected to be observed at least in a few cases of star forming galaxies , and they would help in principle to determine redshifts in the range @xmath137 where no emission lines are present in the visible spectrum .",
    "this may be the case for the giant arc in cl0024 + 17 ( @xcite ) where a blue continuum is detected with no emission lines , but no firm identification has been proposed up to now .",
    "beeing aware that objects with @xmath137 are systematically missed in spectroscopic surveys because of the lack of strong spectral features in their visible spectrum , we find again a similar trend : present - day arcs spectrocopy reveals very few objects at @xmath134 , whatever the selection criteria are .",
    "when neither the seeing nor the surface brightness are considered , the total number counts and the color distributions of arclets are almost independent of the size evolution of sources with redshift . on the contrary ,",
    "when realistic ground - based detection conditions are introduced in the model , the resulting redshift distribution can differ significantly .",
    "figure [ fig - z2218_seeing ] shows these effects on the redshift distribution of arclets in a2218 . when an atmospheric seeing of 1@xmath138 is introduced together with size evolution of galaxies , the observed population splits into two components : one corresponds to spirals at redshifts of the order of 1 and the other one to ellipticals at @xmath6 greater than 2 .",
    "the former probably constitutes the bulk of the redshifts compiled in figure [ fig - zarcs ] because most of these arcs were selected on ground based images and display emission lines .",
    "as expected , including an evolution of the size of galaxies does not change the results on hst data where the psf is always smaller than the angular size of the sources whatever the redshift .",
    "one of the most interesting issues of this work is to produce a tool to select lensed galaxies at various redshifts . instead of computing counts in the whole field , one can compute the 2d distribution for both counts and mean redshifts , in order to estimate and to compare the local densities all over the field . for computational reasons , the surface brightness distribution in  2.1.3 was replaced by the mean value of @xmath139 for each morphological type .",
    "the results for a2218 are shown in figure [ fig - carte ] .",
    "the area where arclets are observed is fairly well identified ( see figure 1 in @xcite for comparison ) .",
    "these figures show the places where the numerous high redshift objects ( seen in the @xmath97 curves ) are expected .",
    "as one goes away from the cluster center , only arcs with high @xmath6 can be lensed to acquire an axis ratio greater than 3 .",
    "however , in the limiting area where arcs can be found , the cutoff in the density of arcs is quite sharp . in the very center of the cluster , radial arcs at high redshift",
    "are also predicted by the model .",
    "these objects remain unobserved because of obscuration by the cd enveloppe .    with the help of our model and maps similar to those in figure [ fig - carte ]",
    "we can optimize the search for well defined samples of arclets and/or the search for high redshift lensed galaxies .",
    "the selection procedure could even benefit from the combination with redshifts estimated through multi - color photometric techniques ( @xcite ) or with the so - called `` lensing redshift '' ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "note that some high - z lensed galaxies at @xmath140 have already been detected , although serendipitously , in the cluster cl0949 + 4713 ( @xcite ) , or in cl1358 + 62 ( @xcite ) , all of them showing `` red '' colors in the visible .",
    "this seems to indicate that , in the absence of a large wavelength coverage , the selection will have to rely on morphological information first and not on the usual criterium based on blue colors .    -2",
    "the observed absolute number counts of arclets presented in figures [ fig - histo2218 ] and [ fig - histo370 ] tend to be overestimated with respect to the predicted values , especially at faint magnitudes where the excess attains a factor of 1.3 to 2 , depending on the cluster .",
    "it is worth noting that computing number counts is difficult because of the large number of uncertainties involved in models , and some of them concerning the evolution of galaxies are quite similar to those encountered in empty fields .",
    "firstly , counts in cluster lenses depend on the local normalisation of the lf , which has an uncertainty of a factor of 2 ( see the discussion in @xcite ) , partly due to the statistical fluctuations from field to field and to the clustering of background galaxies . secondly ,",
    "as we are looking deeply in only a few lines of sight , these fluctuations may introduce a bias because the cluster - lenses selected at first are among those with the highest number of arcs and arclets .",
    "this particular bias is difficult to avoid , but it is not expected to induce a difference larger than a factor of @xmath141 in the case of a2218 , where the differences between observed and predicted number counts are the highest . a possible excess of galaxies at @xmath142 is already mentionned by ebbels et al .",
    "( 1997 ) but it does not seem to strongly distort the final redshift distribution .",
    "an example of clustering of background galaxies is observed behind another cluster - lens , namely the system of arclets in a2390 where two redshift planes are suspected behind the cluster ( @xcite ) preventing to do this kind of analysis .",
    "anyhow , a spectacular change in the number counts is obtained when we take into account the effects due to galaxy - scale mass components .",
    "the number of lensed objects is increased thanks to both the local increased magnification and the additional critical lines which divide giant arcs in smaller ones . a piece of evidence for this effect is given in  3.2 and  3.4 in the case of a2218 , where the number of arclets is a factor of 1.5 higher when galaxy - scale mass components are introduced ( kneib et al . 1996 ) .",
    "this is a strong justification of the need for accurate modelling when computing arcs statistics , and in this sense the present model is a clear improvement with respect to other previous similar works ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in particular ,",
    "the absolute normalisation of counts through a cluster - lens is approached in a reliable way for a2218 . in the case of a370",
    ", we plan to improve the lens modelling by adding the local effects of individual galaxies as additional mass components , thanks to the constraints given by new spectroscopic results which clearly confirm some multiple image candidates ( bzecourt et al . in preparation ) .",
    "if the results are similar to those found in a2218 as expected , this procedure may reconcile the observed number of arclets presently in excess with model predictions for this cluster .",
    "another major point to discuss is the sensitivity of our results to the geometry of the universe .",
    "the two models considered here have been fixed to reproduce both number counts and redshift distributions of galaxies in the field .",
    "the mass models used in all the simulations were determined for a universe with @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "it was assumed here that the same models were still valid for @xmath145 because varying @xmath46 would not change the mass distributions by more than a few percents .",
    "this remark can also be extended to the value of @xmath146 , which has a negligible effect on the lens - model parameters ( less than @xmath147 ) , but a more significant impact on the expected distribution of background sources .",
    "as shown in figures [ fig - z2218-r ] and [ fig - z2218 ] , the value chosen for @xmath30 affects the expected distribution of background sources at high redshift .",
    "the total number counts are also sensitive to @xmath30 ( figures [ fig - z2218-r ] and [ fig - z2218 ] ) , especially at faint magnitudes where the main contribution comes from the more distant objects .",
    "roughly speaking , when @xmath30 changes from @xmath148 to @xmath149 keeping @xmath10 , the efficiency of the cluster - lens given by n(z ) increases by a small factor of less than @xmath150 up to @xmath151 , but it rises dramatically up to a factor of @xmath152 at the highest @xmath6 ( figures [ fig - histo2218 ] and [ fig - histo370 ] ) .",
    "the maximum effect on absolute number counts is @xmath153 for the faintest bins in magnitude ( @xmath154 ) .",
    "when we change from a matter dominated ( @xmath155 ) to a @xmath146 dominated geometry ( @xmath156 ) keeping @xmath144 ( @xmath157 ) , the predicted number counts of arcs will increase by a @xmath158 even at moderate magnitudes ( @xmath159 ) . according to this result",
    ", models with @xmath160 could reconcile observed with predicted number counts of arcs .",
    "the increase in number counts is even higher when we consider models with low values of @xmath161 : it attains @xmath162 at the same moderate magnitudes with @xmath163 and @xmath164 , but this model is somewhat unrealistic .",
    "the main discrepancy between predicted and observed n(z ) for arclets is the apparent lack of objects observed at @xmath165 .",
    "several arguments can be proposed to account for these missing galaxies : ( a ) a systematic bias in the sample of arclets selected for spectroscopy and/or in the successful sub - sample , ( b ) lens modelling is not accurate enough , and ( c ) the spectro - morphological properties of galaxies above @xmath166 are not well represented by the evolutionary models adopted here .",
    "\\(a ) objects with @xmath6 between about 1.2 and 2.2 can be missed in spectroscopic surveys because of the lack of any emission lines in the visible part of the spectrum . in the spectroscopic sample of ebbels et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , it is striking that all the redshift determinations considered as secure correspond to spectra with an emission line , generally identified with [ oii ] .",
    "this clearly indicates a bias in the spectroscopic sample to redshifts lower than 1.2 or higher than 2.2 .",
    "about @xmath162 of this sample of arclets remains with no redshift determination and may correspond to galaxies at @xmath133 .",
    "a more detailed examination of their photometric seds might allow to deduce a photometric redshift and to discuss this particular point .",
    "anyway , as far as no well defined and magnitude - limited samples of arclets are studied yet , no direct comparison with our work can be proposed .",
    "\\(b ) sensitivity to the lens mass distribution has been investigated by several methods , and we have shown that only minor effects apply on the redshift distribution when we change the main parameters of the lens models such as the core radius , the velocity dispersion or the slope of the potential , although this can significantly change the total number of lensed objects .",
    "\\(c ) several uncertainties remain in the general problem of modelling galaxy evolution which could modify the predicted n(z ) .",
    "computing the redshift distribution of gravitational arclets with @xmath167 is in fact equivalent to the distribution of field galaxies up to @xmath168 or fainter after magnification by the cluster .",
    "as the evolution model is constrained roughly until to @xmath1 , where spectroscopic data for field galaxies are available ( @xcite , @xcite ) , a discrepancy may appear at fainter levels .",
    "hence , we would meet here once more the excess in the number of high@xmath6 objects initially found in works about numbers counts ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noted that the introduction of internal absorption by dust in the model could decrease the counts at high redshift as we are mostly interested by the @xmath55band , equivalent to the rest frame @xmath169-band , where absorption effects are more important .",
    "this hypothesis has been explored by campos and shanks ( 1995 ) .",
    "metallicity effects are not taken into account here ( metallicity is assumed to be solar ) , and would act in the opposite way because the uv luminosity is increased for a lower metallicity ( as expected at earlier epochs ) .",
    "the last point to comment is the difference found in the n(z ) distributions behind the two clusters .",
    "the fraction of galaxies at @xmath170 is quite small in the case of a370 with respect to the high redshift tail .",
    "this is essentially related to the difference in the redshift of the lens : the magnification of galaxies at @xmath171 is much less efficient in a370 ( @xmath172 ) than in a2218 ( @xmath173 ) .",
    "this is also visible in the spectroscopic redshift survey of a2218 where 50% of the redshifts are smaller than 0.6 .",
    "we have shown that detailed absolute number counts , color and redshift distributions can be computed for lensed galaxies through an accurate modelling of the cluster - lens mass distribution . the framework for galaxy evolution has been chosen to fairly reproduce the observed number counts and redshift distribution of field galaxies .",
    "the interest in applying these calculations to arclets is to use cluster - lenses as filters to select faint distant galaxies .",
    "we have applied this procedure to two different cluster - lenses , a2218 and a370 , for which the mass distribution is fairly well known , and we have studied the impact of the different sources of uncertainty on the predicted number counts and redshift distributions , taking into account the observational conditions .",
    "the main result is that arcs at redshifts between 0.5 and 1 are correctly predicted by the modelling as observed .",
    "nevertheless , an important population of high redshift arclets ( @xmath0 ) is also revealed by the simulations , which is not observed in spectroscopic surveys of arclets .",
    "this disagreement could result partly from a bias in the spectroscopy of arclets , but the main contribution is probably due to uncertainties in the evolutionary models for galaxies at high redshift .    in summary ,",
    "our results show that a detailed model for the cluster - lens , including galaxy - scale mass components , is absolutely needed to interpret the observed distribution of arcs and arclets in terms of general properties of the background population of galaxies .",
    "a good agreement between model and observed absolute number counts can be obtained by a fine tuning parametrization of the evolutionary models for galaxies and/or the cosmological parameters . in this respect ,",
    "the present work joins the problems encountered in the modelling of faint field galaxy samples ( pbz , @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , the difference in this case is that we are selecting high redshift galaxies and rejecting the faint neighbouring population . as evolutionary effects are extremely sensitive to the behaviour of sources at high redshift ,",
    "the more distant the lens is , easier it will be to constrain them , provided one is able to detect a cluster lens with a sufficient number of arclets . in a more prospective way , observing distant cluster - lenses could help on disentangle the role of pure geometrical effects , giving constraints on the world model , from pure spectromorphological evolution . in any case , the piece of work presented here is just the beginning of a study , an example on two single clusters at moderate redshift , but the effort has to be pursued on a complete sample of lenses in order to minimize the fluctuations and possible clustering along the line of sight , which is difficult to avoid .",
    "for this reason , it is essential to define a homogeneous sample of cluster - lenses in order to derive reliable constraints on the absolute number of background galaxies .",
    "this could be explored by using the sample of distant clusters selected from the emss catalog ( @xcite ) , but it would require an analysis of hst images for each cluster combined with an accurate modelling for all those identified as cluster - lenses .",
    "another interesting effect which is amplified when selecting high redshift objects is the role of elliptical galaxies .",
    "they are responsible for the bulk of the presently undetected population of high redshift arclets at @xmath174 .",
    "changing the redshift of formation modifies the expected n(z ) distribution at such redshifts , but it does not reduce significantly the total excess in number . the most straightforward way to solve",
    "the problem is to break down the hypothesis that ellipticals form in a unique burst .",
    "this idea is also supported by the deep hst images ( see also a discussion in @xcite ) , where the distant galaxies seem rather irregular , deviating from the pure elliptical shape assumed here . in a more general way",
    ", there is no observational reason to assert that the progenitors of present day galaxies follow the simple evolutionary law used here ( spectrophotometric evolution + @xmath175 dimming in surface brightness ) , and the first results on the arclet sample strongly support this idea .",
    "there is more probably a strong relationship between morphology and spectrophotometry , the two aspects being both interdependent and wavelength dependent . in any case , the identification of the distant progenitors of ellipticals remains an exciting challenge .",
    "computing the 2d distributions in number counts or mean redshift seems to be an important tool to build up independent samples of high redshift galaxies .",
    "we propose to couple together the computational tool presented here with photometric redshift techniques in order to select the spectroscopic samples .",
    "it is worth noting that arcs and arclets correspond to a sample of galaxies much less affected by biases in intrisic luminosity .",
    "besides , the brightest galaxies at any ( high ) redshift will be seen through lens magnification before being detected somewhere else .",

    "<S> we present a detailed model of the absolute number counts , color and redshift distributions of gravitational arclets observed in clusters of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the framework adopted for galaxy evolution is chosen to fairly reproduce the observed number counts and redshift distribution of field galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> then , the spectrophotometric evolutionary code is coupled with an accurate modelling of the cluster - lens mass distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the interest in applying these calculations to arclets is to use cluster - lenses as filters to select faint distant galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure is applied on two different cluster - lenses , abell 2218 and abell 370 , for which the mass distribution is well constrained . </S>",
    "<S> we have studied the impact of the different sources of uncertainty on the predicted number counts and redshift distributions , taking into account the observational conditions for two sets of data , hst and ground - based images . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate in details the influence of the mass modelling on the counts and we show that simple cluster - scale potentials can no longer be used for arcs statistics . </S>",
    "<S> the main result is that arcs at redshifts between 0.5 and 1 are correctly predicted by the modelling as observed . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , an important population of high redshift arclets ( @xmath0 ) is also revealed by the simulations , which is not observed in spectroscopic surveys of arclets . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the nature of this disagreement , probably due to uncertainties in the evolutionary models adopted here for galaxies at high redshift . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial distribution of arclets in number density and the local mean redshift of the sample are also derived . </S>",
    "<S> these maps can be used as a tool to optimize the search for high redshift galaxies magnified by the clusters of galaxies . </S>"
