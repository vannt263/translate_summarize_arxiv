    "brownian motion refers to the random motion of small particles immersed in a large bath .",

    "the theorem can also be utilized to evaluate the mean - squared displacement of the brownian particle and thereby illustrate the diffusive nature of the particle .",
    "it is well known that , in a bath maintained at a finite temperature , the mean - squared displacement of the brownian particle grows linearly with time at late times .",

    "<S> we investigate the random motion of a mirror in @xmath0-dimensions that is immersed in a thermal bath of massless scalar particles which are interacting with the mirror through a boundary condition . imposing the dirichlet or the neumann boundary conditions on the moving mirror , we evaluate the mean radiation reaction force on the mirror and the correlation function describing the fluctuations in the force about the mean value . from the correlation function </S>",
    "<S> thus obtained , we explicitly establish the fluctuation - dissipation theorem governing the moving mirror . using the fluctuation - dissipation theorem </S>",
    "<S> , we compute the mean - squared displacement of the mirror at finite and zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we clarify a few points concerning the various limiting behavior of the mean - squared displacement of the mirror . while we recover the standard result at finite temperature , we find that the mirror diffuses logarithmically at zero temperature , confirming similar conclusions that have been arrived at earlier in this context </S>",
    "<S> . we also comment on a subtlety concerning the comparison between zero temperature limit of the finite temperature result and the exact zero temperature result . </S>"
