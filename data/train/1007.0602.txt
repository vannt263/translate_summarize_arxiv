    "one challenge in constraint programming is to develop effective search methods to deal with common modelling patterns .",

    "a constraint satisfaction problem ( csp ) consists of a set of variables , each with a domain of values , and a set of constraints specifying allowed values for subsets of variables .",

    "an important feature of many csps is symmetry .",

    "a simple but effective method to deal with symmetry is to add _ symmetry breaking constraints _ which eliminate symmetric solutions .",

    "many problems are naturally modelled by a matrix of decision variables with variable symmetry in which the rows and/or columns are interchangeable @xcite .",
    "we say that a csp containing a matrix of decision variables has row symmetry iff given a solution , any permutation of the rows is also a solution .",
    "similarly , it has column symmetry iff given a solution , any permutation of the columns is also a solution .    the equidistant frequency permutation array ( efpa ) problem is a challenging problem in coding theory .",
    "the goal is to find a set of @xmath5 code words , each of length @xmath6 such that each word contains @xmath7 copies of the symbols 1 to @xmath8 , and each pair of code words is hamming distance @xmath9 apart .",
    "for example , for @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , one solution is :    @xmath14    this problem has applications in communication theory , and is related to other combinatorial problems like finding orthogonal latin squares .",

    "note that all 4 of these 4 by 5 matrices are row and column symmetries of each other .",
    "for instance , consider the row and column symmetry @xmath0 that reflects the matrix in the horizontal axis , and swaps the 1st column with the 2nd , and the 3rd with the 4th : @xmath116 in general , we consider the @xmath33 by @xmath33 permutation matrix : @xmath117 this satisfies the constraints . we can add any @xmath108th column which reading top to bottom is lexicographically larger than or equal to the @xmath118th column and reading bottom",
    "to top is lexicographically larger than or equal to the @xmath33th column .",
    "in fact , we can add any column with eactly @xmath19 of the @xmath33 bits set .",
    "this gives us a set of @xmath33 by @xmath108 matrices that are row and column symmetries of each other .",
    "there are @xmath119 bit vectors with exactly @xmath19 of @xmath33 bits set .",
    "hence , we have @xmath119 matrices which satisfy that are in the same row and column symmetry class . using stirling s formula , this grows as @xmath109 .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ tm : fpt ] gives a polynomial method to break all row and column symmetry .",
    "this allows us to compare symmetry breaking methods for matrix models like and , not only with respect to each other but for the first time in absolute terms .",
    "our aim is to evaluate : first , whether the worst - case scenarios identified in theorems  [ tm : expsol ] and  [ tm : snake - expsol ] are indicative of what can be expected in practice ; second , how effective these methods are with respect to each other ; third , in cases where they differ significantly , how much closer the best of them is to the optimal .    to answer these questions , we experimented with different symmetry breaking constraints : @xmath16 , the column - wise ( @xmath120 ) or the row - wise ( @xmath121 ) @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath122 to denote no symmetry breaking constraints . for each problem",
    "instance we found the total number of solutions left by symmetry breaking constraints ( @xmath123 ) and computed how many of them were symmetric based on the method outlined in the proof of theorem  [ tm : fpt ] .",
    "the number of _ non symmetric _ solutions is equal to the number of symmetry classes ( @xmath124 ) if the search space is exhausted . in all instances",
    "at least one model exhausted the search space to compute the of symmetry classes , shown in the column @xmath125 .",
    "we use ` @xmath126 ' to indicate that the search is not completed within the time limit . as the  model typically could not exhaust the search space within the time limit , we use ` @xmath127 ' to indicate a lower bound on the number of solutions . finally , we used a variable ordering heuristic that follows the corresponding lex - leader variable ordering in each set of symmetry breaking constraints ( i.e. row - wise snake ordering with @xmath121 ) .",
    "we ran experiments in gecode 3.3.0 on an intel xeon x5550 , 2.66 ghz , 32 gb ram with @xmath128 sec timeout .    _ unconstrained problems .",
    "_ we first evaluated the effectiveness of symmetry breaking constraints in the absence of problem constraints .",
    "this gives the `` pure '' effect of these constraints at eliminating row and column symmetry .",
    "we considered a problem with a matrix @xmath129 , @xmath130 $ ] , @xmath131 $ ] , @xmath132 $ ] whose rows and columns are interchangeable .",
    "table  [ t : t2 ] summarizes the results .",
    "the first part presents typical results for 0/1 matrices whilst the second part presents results for larger domains .",
    "the results support the exponential worst case in theorems  [ tm : expsol ] and  [ tm : snake - expsol ] , as the ratio of solutions found to symmetry classes increases from 1.25 ( 3,3,2 ) to over 6 ( 6,6,2 ) , approximately doubling with each increase of the matrix size .",
    "as we increase the problem size , the number of symmetric solutions left by and  grows rapidly .",
    "interestingly , @xmath120 achieves better pruning on 0/1 matrices , while @xmath16 performs better with larger domains .    .[t",

    "number of solutions found by posting different sets of symmetry breaking constraints .",
    "@xmath133 is the number of vectors , @xmath134 is the length of a vector , @xmath135 is the size of the domains , @xmath136 is the covering strength .

    "we used the non - boolean model of efpa  @xcite ( table  [ t : t1 ] ) , the boolean matrix model of bibd  @xcite ( table  [ t : t3 ] ) and a simple model of ca  @xcite ( table  [ t : t4 ] ) .",
    "we consider the satisfaction version of the ca problem with a given number of vectors @xmath133 . in all problems",
    "instances the @xmath16 , @xmath121 and @xmath120 constraints show their effectiveness , leaving only a small fraction of symmetric solutions .",
    "note that @xmath120 often leaves fewer symmetric solutions .",
    "however , it is significantly slower compared to @xmath16 and @xmath121 because it tends to prune later ( thereby exploring larger search trees ) .",
    "for example , the number of failures for the @xmath137 efpa problem is @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 for @xmath16 , @xmath121 and @xmath120 respectively .",
    "on efpa problems , @xmath121 is about twice as fast as @xmath16 and leaves less solutions .",
    "on the ca problems @xmath16 and @xmath121 show similar results , while @xmath16 performs better on bibd problems in terms of the number of solution left .",
    "overall , our results show that @xmath16 and @xmath141 prune most of the symmetric solutions . @xmath120",
    "slightly outperforms @xmath16 and @xmath121 in terms of the number of solutions left , but it explores larger search trees and is about two orders of magnitude slower",
    ". however , there is little difference overall in the amount of symmetry eliminated by the three methods .",

    "more recently , grayland _ et al .",
    "_ have proposed , an alternative to based on linearizing the matrix in a snake - like way @xcite .",
    "an alternative way to break the symmetry of interchangeable values is to convert it into a variable symmetry by channelling into a dual 0/1 viewpoint in which @xmath142 iff @xmath143 , and using lexicographical ordering constraints on the columns of the 0/1 matrix @xcite .",
    "however , this hinders propagation @xcite .",
    "finally , dynamic methods like sbds have been proposed to remove symmetry from the search tree @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , dynamic techniques tend not to work well with row and columns symmetries as the number of symmetries is usually too large .",
    "we have provided a number of positive and negative results on dealing with row and column symmetry . to eliminate some ( but not all ) symmetry we can post static constraints like and . on the positive side , we proposed the first polynomial time method to eliminate _ all _ row and column symmetry when the number of rows ( or columns ) is bounded . on the negative side",
