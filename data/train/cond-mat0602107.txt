    "the properties of a superconducting film or thin wire s are modified when they are in contact with a normal metal n. this phenomenon was first observed in the pioneering experiments by meissner @xcite who explored the properties of superconducting wires covered with normal metals .",
    "it is generally called the `` superconducting proximity effect '' ( spe ) .",
    "it was intensively studied in the 1960 s @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . during the last decade",
    "it has experienced a renewed interest theoretically @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite as well as experimentally @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "recently the spe has been extended to sn - multi layers @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a few years ago , our group @xcite investigated the proximity effect between pb and several alkali metals . for a better analysis of these measurements we developed a quantitative numerical method for the calculation of the transition temperature of an sn double layer @xcite .",
    "our numerical results show that , when a superconductor s is covered with a normal metal n , that the initial slope @xmath3 is independent of the mean free paths of the two metals and the transparency of the interface ( if the transmission is not dramatically changed ) . if one defines a normalized initial slope @xmath4 then @xmath5 is independent of the thickness @xmath6 of the superconductor up to relatively large values of @xmath6 .",
    "if the superconductor is very weak coupling ( @xmath7 , @xmath8=debye temperature ) then our result for the initial slope converges towards the results for the thin film cooper limit @xcite ( see below ) .",
    "when we compared our experimental initial slope @xmath9 with our numerical calculation we observed that the experimental results were considerably smaller than the theoretical predictions .",
    "surprised by the discrepancy we searched the literature and found early experiments from the 1960s , particularly by hilsch @xcite , @xcite and minigerode @xcite , from which the normalized initial slope can be derived .",
    "these measurements showed a similar disagreement in the initial slope with the theory ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    since we were rather amazed by the discrepancy between our experiments and theory in the spe and also by the fact that this discrepancy had not been detected previously , we decided to re - investigate the spe . in this paper",
    "we investigate the spe in the range , where a minimum of experimental parameters is needed to perform a quantitative comparison with the theory .",
    "we focus on the normalized initial slope @xmath5 of sn sandwiches and the transition temperature of very thin ns sandwiches in the thin film limit .",
    "we use thermal evaporation to condense the thin films onto a substrate at liquid helium temperature . to obtain clean films all the evaporation sources are surrounded with liquid n@xmath10 and the vacuum in our system is better than @xmath11torr . we first evaporate 10 atomic layers of insulating sb on a helium cold quartz substrate .",
    "the sb film acts as a fresh substrate and insures that the following quench condensed films are flat and homogeneous .    in a series of experiments a film of the superconductor pb",
    "is first condensed onto the sb substrate .",
    "afterwards the pb is covered in several step with an increasing thickness of the normal metal ag .",
    "the thickness of the films is measured with a quartz oscillator .",
    "the accuracy of the thickness measurement is about 15% .",
    "after each evaporation the superconducting transition curve , the magnetoresistance and the hall effect of the double layer are measured .",

    "let us consider a double layer with the superconducting transition temperature @xmath0 .",

    "a well - known example is the thin film or cooper  limit of a double layer when both films are much thinner than their coherence lengths and the transmission time  through the interface is much shorter than @xmath44 in the limit that @xmath45is much smaller than the debye temperature , @xmath46 the transition temperature of such a double layer is given by the bcs - cooper formula @xmath47 where the effective bcs interaction @xmath48 of the double layer is @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the bcs interactions in the super- and normal conductor .",

    "( this is sometimes called the single mode expansion ) .",
    "this theory agrees quite well with the experimental results for double layers of two superconductors @xcite .",

    "this numerical calculation derives the transition temperature of a double or multi layer of a superconductor and a normal conductor .",
    "the equivalence in the propagation of the superconducting pair amplitude and a single electron in gorkov s linear gap equation is used .",
    "the single electrons act as messengers which carry the information about the superconducting gap ( @xmath60 ) from one position - time @xmath61 to another position - time @xmath62 .",
    "this message which decays thermally with time as @xmath63 , is integrated at @xmath64 over all starting position - times @xmath65 and , after multiplication with the bcs interaction @xmath66  yields the new gap function @xmath67 . at the transition temperature",
    "the procedure has to be self - consistent , i.e. the initial and final gap function have to be identical .",
    "the propagation of the single electrons is then quasi - classically simulated .",
    "the frame work of the calculation is the weak coupling theory of superconductivity .",
    "this numerical procedure to calculate the transition temperature of double or multi - layers consisting of thin films of superconductors and normal conductors is very flexible .",
    "it uses the following input parameters of the individual metal films ( i ) thickness , ( ii ) density of states and fermi velocity , ( iii ) transition temperature , ( iv ) debye temperature , ( v ) mean free path and ( vi ) transmission through the interface between the films .",
    "an important outcome of the numerical simulation is the result that the normalized initial slope of an sn double layer as a function of @xmath68 at @xmath69 does not depend on ( i ) the mean free paths of the two metals , ( ii ) the thickness of the superconductor and ( iii ) a finite ( but not too large ) barrier between the two metals .",
    "we include the numerical results @xmath70 in table i. for the double layers with the normal conducting metals cu , ag , au and mg the discrepancy between experiment and theory is very large , of the order of 3 . it is remarkable that the deviation is considerably smaller when the normal metal  is really a superconductor with a smaller transition temperature although the deviation is still factor of about 1.5 . for in and sn",
    ", however , there is a good agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "it is surprising that this disagreement between experiment and theory has not been noticed in the past .",
    "the main reason is that the majority of the experimental and the theoretical work focused on ns sandwiches with thick normal metal films .",
    "then superconductivity is only obtained for a finite thickness of the superconductor . in this case a comparison between experiment and theory requires many fit parameters such as the transparency of the interface and the mean free paths of the superconductor and the normal conductor .",
    "therefore it is quite possible to fit the experimental data by using the wrong parameters that ca nt be checked otherwise .",
    "the physical origin of this disagreement between experiment and theory is not understood .",
    "our theoretical simulation of the spe uses the frame work of weak coupling superconductivity .",
    "quench condensed pb , in and sn are not weak coupling .",
    "the ratios of @xmath71 for quench condensed films are 4.6 for pb , 3.9 for in and 4.0 for sn @xcite , @xcite",
    ". an obvious proposal would be to solve the superconducting proximity effect for strong coupling superconductors .",
    "this means to develop and solve a series of equations for the energy and position dependent gap function @xmath72",
    ". this would be an extremely demanding job . as a start",
    ", we considered the thin film limit for the spe of strong superconductors .",
    "this consideration , which will be published elsewhere , does not remove the discrepancy between experiment and theory .",
    "the fact that the werthamer result @xmath34 disagrees less with the experimental data @xmath32 for cu , ag , au and mg than our numerical result might be accidental .",
    "the single mode expansion of @xmath67 in the werthamer theory is surely less appropriate than a self - consistant gap function .",
    "the experimental normalized initial slope is proportional to the density of states ratio .",
    "although the density of states can be modified in quench condensed films it is inconceivable that this explains a factor of three in the initial slope .",
    "let us return to fig.1 where the reduction of @xmath0 of pb by a thin layer of ag is plotted .",
    "in this paper , the superconducting proximity effect is investigated for sn double layers in a regime where the resulting @xmath0 does not depend on the mean free path of the films and , within limits , not on the transparency of the interface .",
    "this regime includes the thin film limit and the normalized initial slope @xmath73 .",
    "while the layer s is always pb the layer n is either a non - superconducting metal such as cu , ag , au and mg or a superconductor with a @xmath0 below the transition temperature of pb . the experimental results for the transition temperature @xmath0 are compared with a numerical calculation which was recently developed in our group .",
    "the results for the sn double layers can be divided into three groups :    * when n represents a non - superconducting metal film ( n = cu , ag , au and mg ) we observe grave deviations between experiment and theory by a factor of the order of three .",
    "* when n represents a superconductor with a low @xmath0 ( n = cd , zn , al ) the deviation between experiment and theory is still there but reduced by a factor of two .",
    "* when n represents a superconductor with a @xmath0 which is about half the @xmath0 of pb ( n = in , sn ) then we observe a reasonably good agreement between experiment and theory .",
    "prior to our recent experiments we believed that the proximity effect between a superconductor and a normal conductor represented an intensively studied phenomenon with a good theoretical understanding .",
    "we are deeply puzzled by the large observed discrepancy between experiment and theory .",
    "it would be very desirable if other theoretical approaches would give quantitative predictions for the normalized initial slope in sn double layers .",
    "there have been a number of theoretical papers published which extended the proximity effect to more complex systems , for example between a superconductor and a ferromagnet but which include implicitly the simpler case of an sn double layer .",
    "these authors would be able to calculate quantitatively the normalized initial slope from their theory .",
    "experimentally it would be desirable to extend the measurements to sn layers where s is a weak coupling superconductor .",
    "this requires lower temperatures but permits the use of thicker films because the coherence lengths are larger at lower temperatures .",
    "aluminum would be a good candidate for the superconductor if evaporated in ultra - high vacuum so that the al is not granular ."
