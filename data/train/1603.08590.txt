    "<S> section [ finitelygen ] addresses finitely generated associative shelves , their cardinalities and generating functions . following this , finitely generated proto - unital shelves , pre - unital shelves , and unital shelves are discussed . while some of the observations in this section are new , others are stated for completeness ( @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .    in section [ homologyassoc ] , the two well - known homology theories for self - distributive algebraic structures , namely one - term distributive homology and two - term ( rack ) homology are defined and the main results concerning the homology groups of a special class of associative shelves are proven . in particular , we compute one - term and two - term ( rack ) homology of unital shelves . </S>",
    "<S> the main theorem concerning two - term homology of shelves with right fixed elements extends to the two - term ( rack ) homology groups of laver tables ( @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) and f - block spindles ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    finally , section [ future ] and the appendix contain conjectures and computational data . </S>"
