    "the single impurity anderson model @xcite is one of the most fundamental and probably the best understood model for strong electronic correlations . invented to describe the properties of magnetic impurities in non - magnetic metallic hosts 35 years ago , a variety of standard techniques have been applied to it and new methods have been developed to study its static and dynamic properties in basically the whole parameter space ( for a review see e.g.   @xcite ) .",
    "although a very clear picture of the physics of the single impurity anderson model has emerged from these calculations , a reliable method for calculating dynamic properties at very low temperatures and intermediate or large values of the coulomb interaction was for a long time missing .",
    "for example , bethe ansatz calculations @xcite , which are essentially exact , can only access static properties and the quantum monte carlo method @xcite , which can be viewed as another numerically exact technique , can not reach very low temperatures and/or large values of the coulomb parameter , although it does not suffer from a minus sign problem here .",
    "in addition , the analytic continuation of the imaginary time data to real frequencies is a numerically highly ill - conditioned problem .    among the approximate treatments",
    "the resolvent perturbation theory together with the so - called non - crossing approximation @xcite turned out to be a simple and powerful technique for high and intermediate temperatures of the order of the kondo scale but completely fails to reproduce the local fermi - liquid properties as @xmath6 .",
    "last but not least , straightforward second - order perturbation theory in @xmath7 @xcite has been shown to work surprisingly well down to @xmath8 but it is restricted to the symmetric case and not too large values of @xmath7 .    the numerical renormalization group method ( nrg ) , invented by wilson for the kondo problem @xcite and later applied by krishnamurthy et al . to the impurity anderson model @xcite , is usually acknowledged primarily in the context of universality and low - energy fixed point behaviour of the kondo or anderson model .",
    "one of its most appealing features is that it can deal equally well with small , intermediate or large values of @xmath7 and is not restricted to half - filling . during the last 15 years considerable progress has been made to extract dynamical properties with this method , too , and it has been shown to give very accurate results also for e.g.  dynamical one- and two - particle and also transport properties @xcite .",
    "the nrg works best at @xmath8 , and various dynamic correlation functions can be calculated with an accuracy of a few percent .",
    "although less well defined for finite temperatures , its extension to @xmath9 also shows very good agreement with exact results @xcite .",
    "it is quite remarkable that no sum - rules ( friedel sum rule , total spectral weight ) must be used as input for these calculations . on the contrary",
    ", they can serve as an independent check on the quality of the results .",
    "more recent interest in reliable methods to solve the impurity anderson model and calculate its dynamical properties has been motivated by the discovery that lattice models in the limit of infinite dimensions acquire a purely local one particle self - energy @xcite .",
    "this simplification eventually leads to a mapping of the lattice problem on an effective impurity anderson model coupled to a medium to be determined self - consistently @xcite .",
    "note that in the general case the solution of this self - consistency requires the knowledge of the one particle self - energy . in view of the wide range of problems",
    "to which this so - called dynamical mean field theory ( dmft , see e.g.  @xcite ) can be applied , it seems surprising why there have been hardly any contributions using the nrg .",
    "the only nrg - calculation known to us is the work of sakai et al .",
    "@xcite where the symmetric hubbard model in the metallic regime was studied . in their paper , these authors point out some difficulties in the progress of iterating the nrg results with the dmft equations , which are largely related to the necessary broadening of the nrg spectra ( see further below ) .    in this contribution",
    "we present a new method to calculate dynamic properties for the impurity anderson model , namely by directly constructing the interaction contribution to the self - energy as the ratio of two correlation functions , @xmath10 , with @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( see section ii ) .",
    "details of how to calculate the @xmath13 are given in the appendix . in section iii",
    "we discuss results for    * the standard case , where the coupling between impurity states and metallic host , @xmath14 , is constant , * and the hubbard model in @xmath15 , where @xmath2 has to be determined self - consistently .    the hubbard model is studied in the paramagnetic regime , at half - filling and @xmath8 .",
    "we discuss the properties of self - energy and local density of states both in the metallic and insulating regimes and some preliminary results for the metal - insulator transition .",

    "alternatively , the interaction part of the self - energy can of course also be calculated directly from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gfofz ] ) using @xmath47 on a first glance , there seems to be no apparent reason to prefer the more complicated equation ( [ eq : sigma ] ) over equation ( [ eq : sigma_inv ] ) . in order to clarify the advantage of using eq .",

    "the important point of the method is that the coupling between consecutive elements of the chain decreases exponentially for increasing distance from the origin , so that with increasing chain length at each iteration basically only the lowest lying states will be renormalized and such a truncation is meaningful .",
    "the spectral functions at each iteration are calculated from the corresponding matrix elements , which are in turn related to those of the previous iteration .",

    "the spectral function for the whole frequency range has to be built up from the data of all the iterations .",

    "it is well known that with this scheme the nrg gives already quite accurate results for @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "however , one might anticipate some problems with the calculation of @xmath45 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma_inv ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath58 is , of course , known exactly since @xmath2 is a given quantity .",
    "building the difference between an exactly known and a numerically determined function is usually very susceptible to numerical errors , especially in regions where the result becomes small .",
    "since this is expected to happen close to the fermi level , i.e.  in the physically most relevant region , one is likely to run into problems there .",
    "one naive attempt to reduce these kind of inconsistencies and numerical errors when building the difference in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma_inv ] ) is to treat @xmath58 and @xmath59 on the same level , that is to calculate @xmath58 via the nrg as well by setting @xmath60 .",
    "however , since according to the theory of error propagation in sums or differences the absolute errors add , one must expect this procedure to be also ill - conditioned .",
    "if both @xmath61 and @xmath25 are known exactly , the difference @xmath62 always gives a negative imaginary part for the self - energy as there would be a pole in @xmath59 for every pole in @xmath58 at the same energy with equal or larger residue .",
    "this is no longer guaranteed as soon as both @xmath61 and @xmath25 are only known approximately , and one has to use rather large values of the broadening parameter @xmath55 to avoid unphysical oscillations in @xmath45 .",
    "this broadening in turn leads to a strong suppression of the high energy peaks because spectral weight is shifted from the center of the peak to its tails ( to the high energy side due to eq .",
    "( [ gauss ] ) ) .",
    "for the calculation of @xmath45 via eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma ] ) on the other hand we do not expect to face these kind of problems that severely .",
    "again , both quantities are calculated on the same basis by broadening the nrg results with ( [ gauss ] ) , i.e.  with the same systematic error .",
    "this time , however , we _ divide _ them by each other , which means that only the _ relative _ errors will be propagated , leading to a numerically much more stable procedure .",
    "let us support this rather qualitative argument in favour of expressing the self - energy as the ratio @xmath63 by comparing the spectral function @xmath64 obtained directly from the nrg ( solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] ) and the @xmath65 calculated from eq.([eq : gfofz ] ) with the self - energy expressed as in eq .",

    "the 7% deviation in @xmath74 can in principle be reduced by improving the resolution of the nrg calculation ( smaller deviations have been achieved e.g.  in @xcite ) .",
    "this is , however , not necessary in our case because the self - energy resulting from eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma ] ) is an analytic function and the sum - rule @xmath75 is then automatically fulfilled ( apart from the very small numerical error ) . * the charge fluctuation peaks near @xmath21 are much more pronounced in @xmath76 .",
    "that the high energy features are usually underrated is a well - known problem in the calculation of dynamical properties with the nrg .",
    "this problem is at least partially resolved in our new scheme , since the main contribution in this part of the spectrum rather comes from the hybridization part @xmath2 , which is treated exactly .",
    "* the oscillations in @xmath64 near @xmath77 are due to the choice of the broadening which is obviously too small to see the correct low - frequency behaviour of the spectral function .",
    "these oscillations almost vanish in @xmath65 and the @xmath78- behaviour can be clearly identified .",
    "* the deviation from the friedel sum - rule @xmath79 ( @xmath80 for the parameters used here ) is about 7% in @xmath64 and 4% in @xmath65 .",
    "although the error in the friedel sum - rule is visibly reduced , the deviation is still a few percent .",
    "its origin will be discussed in the following .",

    "the self - energy finally is given with eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma ] ) as @xmath84 in the particle - hole symmetric case , @xmath85 necessarily vanishes at @xmath77 , therefore @xmath86 which of course has to give the hartree term @xmath87 , and @xmath88 in the case of the standard single - impurity anderson model we furthermore know that the friedel sum - rule @xmath89 has to be fulfilled , which implies that @xmath90 where @xmath91 denotes the principal value . the relation ( [ eq : ref0 ] ) is obviously not trivial regarding the unusual shape of @xmath82 .",
    "it indeed turns out that @xmath92 is numerically zero as long as the _ full _ spectrum of the hamiltonian can be used . however , as soon as a truncation of states sets in the calculated value for @xmath93 suddenly jumps to a finite value , eventually leading to a violation of the friedel sum - rule as observed e.g.  in figure [ fig : f1 ] .",
    "this observation suggests that also high energy states are important to guarantee that @xmath94 and that a slight violation of the friedel sum - rule is almost unavoidable in this method .",
