    "the study of strongly - correlated magnetic systems has experienced a tremendous boost thanks to inputs from quantum information processing @xcite . in particular , the analysis of various forms of entanglement has revealed deep connections to quantum phase transitions @xcite and order parameters @xcite , conformal field theory @xcite and numerical simulations of quantum many - body systems @xcite .",
    "the fidelity approach has been successful for the analysis of quantum phase transitions ( qpt ) with no order parameters or with infinite order @xcite .    an alternative approach based on quantum correlations",
    "has allowed the quantum information / condensed matter community to analyse the  quantumness \" of not only the ground state of magnetic hamiltonians , but also thermal states . for the latter , entanglement tends to disappear quite rapidly with temperature and is subject to mathematical pathologies such as the  sudden death \" @xcite .",
    "quantum discord ( qd ) is a measure of nonclassicality that has attracted a lot of attention recently  @xcite .",
    "while the resource nature of qd is still an open question  @xcite , it has shown to be a remarkably effective tool in studying a range of quantum phenomena and protocols including qpts  @xcite , entanglement distribution  @xcite , and work extraction  @xcite .",
    "while most of the literature is devoted to the discord of two - level systems and continuous variable gaussian states , very little has been done for higher dimensional quantum states  @xcite .",
    "this can be understood in light of the difficulty in evaluating qd  @xcite .",
    "thus , this work aims at providing a concrete analysis of the qd in a realizable physical system beyond those typically examined , namely a spin-1 chain .    in this paper",
    ", we study the quantum discord of spin-1 chains governed by a heisenberg hamiltonian and in the presence of single - ion anisotropy , i.e. a uniaxial ( quadratic zeeman ) field .",
    "the model gives rise to three gapped magnetic phases ( nel , haldane , large - d ) separated by a second order transition and a gaussian one respectively .",
    "the haldane phase , a symmetry protected phase , is quite peculiar as it is characterised by the absence of local order but by the establishment of a hidden string order parameter .    while this model has been studied extensively in the condensed matter and quantum information communities using the entanglement and fidelity  @xcite , a systematic investigation of its discord content is missing .",
    "the aim of this paper is to fill this gap by analysing the two - spins discord and the global version introduced in ref .",
    "we employ numerical simulations based on exact diagonalisation and density matrix renormalisation group ( dmrg ) @xcite .",
    "we find that discord is able to locate very accurately the two transitions by showing singular behaviour as a function of the single - ion anisotropy .",
    "moreover , for the gaussian transition we are able to extract an estimate for the critical exponent for the correlation length . finally , we analyse the thermal behaviour of discord and find that while it normally decays with increasing temperature , in the large - d phase and for two non nearest - neighbour spins it actually increases .",

    "the quantum discord ( qd ) between two systems @xmath0 and @xmath1 described by a density matrix @xmath2 can be defined as the difference of two distinct ways to measure correlations in a quantum system that would otherwise give the same result classically  @xcite .",
    "the first way is to use the quantum mutual information @xmath3 where @xmath4 $ ] is the von neumann entropy of the reduced state @xmath5 of system @xmath0 and analogously for system @xmath1 .",
    "the quantity @xmath6 is the conditional entropy .",
    "an alternative definition of correlations can be given in terms of information acquired on @xmath0 after performing a measurement of @xmath1 with a set of projectors @xmath7 .",

    "a symmetrized version of the qd can be obtained with a bi - local measurement @xmath13 such that @xmath14 .",
    "we define the symmetric qd @xmath15 where we have introduced the relative entropy : @xmath16-{\\text{tr}}[\\rho\\log_2\\sigma],\\ ] ] which vanishes as @xmath17 approaches @xmath18 .",
    "eq .   can be interpreted as the difference between the first term , that is global on @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and the second term , which is the sum of two local contributions .",
    "eq .   was shown to be generalizable to multipartite states  @xcite . for a quantum system comprising of @xmath19 subsystems we define the global quantum discord ( gqd ) @xmath20 in order to evaluate eqs .   and",
    "for the spin-1 system presented in the following section , we require suitable projective measurements . in ref .",
    "@xcite the parametrization of local orthogonal measurements for spin-1 particles was given .",
    "we use the spin-1 operators @xmath21 fulfilling the normal angular momentum commutation relations . for simplicity",
    ", we define the eigenstates of the @xmath22-component of the angular momentum as : @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "a projective measurement for three - level systems is specified by three orthogonal projectors summing to the identity matrix @xmath25 where @xmath0 is a unitary matrix and we have defined the transformed basis states as @xmath26    contrary to spin-1/2 systems , the norm of the bloch vector for pure states , @xmath27 is not always one for spin-1 systems , i.e. they are not always coherent states .",
    "this is related to the fact that , while for spin-1/2 particles unitaries can always be written as spin rotations ( apart from an irrelevant phase factor ) , for spin-1 there exist more general unitaries related to quadrupolar operators , which induce spin squeezing .",
    "thus , the most general unitary should be written as the exponential of a polynomial of degree 2 in the spin operators .",
    "alternatively one can split this exponential as the product of the exponentials of simpler combinations of spin operators .",

    "we conduct our analysis on the ground and thermal states of a spin-1 chain described by the heisenberg hamiltonian with uniaxial anisotropy of strength @xmath32 @xmath33 where the subscript @xmath34 runs over the sites in the chain and we will consider both open and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "when @xmath35 @xmath36 the anisotropy is usually referred to as  easy - axis \" (  easy - plane \" ) anisotropy .",
    "the ground state phase diagram consists of three phases : for @xmath37 the system is in the  large d \" phase @xcite in which the ground state has a strong component onto the @xmath38 state . for @xmath39 ,",
    "the system is in the nel antiferromagnetic phase , characterized by the staggered magnetization . for the intermediate values of @xmath40 $ ] , the system is in the haldane phase , a symmetry protected phase , characterized by the absence of local ordering , a nonlocal string - order parameter and an entanglement spectrum with even degeneracies @xcite .",
    "the transition separating the nel and haldane phases is of the ising type , with the staggered magnetization ordering in the nel phase .",
    "the transition from haldane to large d is of gaussian type and has been recently studied in @xcite .",
    "the entanglement properties of spin-1 chains have been studied using the block entropy and entanglement spectrum @xcite , thus connecting with predictions from conformal field theory .    when computing discord we need to optimize the basis so as to minimize the quantities introduced in the previous section .",
    "the ground and thermal states of the real symmetric hamiltonian @xmath41 can be chosen real .",
    "it follows that the optimal basis is always real as in ref .",
    "this further reduces the number of parameters to optimize over since we impose @xmath42 so that the basis @xmath43 is a real superposition of the states @xmath44 .",
    "we remark that this constraint is only applied to the optimization of the gqd , which due to computational complexity , necessitates such simplifications . however , when dealing with the symmetric qd , eq .",
    ", a full minimization with the full set of angles is tractable .     for @xmath45 . for odd length chains the ground state changes suddenly due to energy level crossings .",
    "here we see the first crossing at @xmath46 and a second crossing at @xmath47 . ]",
    "when considering finite - length chains , we find an even / odd parity effect with the total length , the origin of which lies in a geometrical frustration for odd lengths .",
    "in fact , in the repulsively interacting heisenberg chain we are considering , nearest - neighbor spins tend to form strongly correlated pairs , an effect observed in the alternating behavior of the block entropy and other correlations .",
    "thus , while for an even chain all spins are paired , for odd chains there is always an unpaired spin .",
    "this frustration gives rise to energy crossings as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : energylevelgraph ] .",
    "this means that , at these energy crossings , the ground state of the system changes discontinuously with @xmath32 .",
    "for this reason , we examine even and odd lengths separately , as for the latter we will observe discontinuities in the discord measures .",
    "however , we remark that this is a finite size effect that will vanish in the thermodynamic limit , as the three phases of the model are all gapped .    , for the reduced state of the two central spins of an open - ended chain of length @xmath48 8 ( red ) , 16 ( green ) , 32 ( blue ) , 64 ( gray ) , 128 ( black ) and 256 ( orange ) going from bottom to top .",

    "we see the curves for all lengths have collapsed on top of each other and the reduced states are virtually identical .",
    "this indicates that , in these regions ( which are sufficiently far from the qpts of the model ) , already with 8 spins , we are close to the properties of the thermodynamic limit . in the intermediate region , @xmath56 $ ] , the curves exhibit a much richer behavior , and as we increase @xmath51 the value of the qd increases .",

    "this corresponds to the point when the optimizing angles required to minimize @xmath52 change .",
    "when @xmath35 we find @xmath52 is optimized when both spins are measured using the angles @xmath58 , corresponding to a projection onto the eigenbasis of @xmath59 , while for @xmath60 we require @xmath61 , @xmath62 , corresponding to a projection onto the eigenbasis of @xmath63 . for @xmath57 both sets of angles give identical values of @xmath52 .",
    "such a sudden change is unsurprising considering that at this point we are switching from easy - axis for @xmath35 to easy - plane for @xmath60 anisotropy .",
    "although @xmath57 is not a critical point , the hamiltonian , and therefore its ground state , is su(2 ) invariant , and projective spin measurements differing only by a spin rotation give the same discord . indeed ,",
    "such behavior is not uncommon when dealing with nonclassicality indicators that involve complex parameter optimizations .",
    "a similar behavior was recently reported in the spin-1/2 @xmath64 model when examining measures of local quantum coherence  @xcite .     in the critical region of the gaussian qpt .",
    "the point markers are the numerically calculated values @xmath51=16 ( downward green triangles ) , 32 ( blue diamonds ) , 64 ( gray circles ) , 128 ( black squares ) , and 256 ( upward orange triangles ) .",

    "[ dmrg2 ] ( a ) we examine the derivative of the qd with respect to @xmath32 for chains of increasing length .",
    "we see a peaked behavior appearing near @xmath68 , which becomes more pronounced for larger @xmath51 .",
    "such behavior is consistent with the signature of a second order qpt @xcite : a discontinuity of the second order derivative of the ground state energy or of the first derivative of the state ( and therefore of discord ) .",
    "we can accurately predict the critical value for @xmath69 through finite size extrapolation . in fig .",
    "[ dmrg2 ] ( b ) we disregard the two smallest sized chains ( @xmath53 and 16 ) and find the linear fit for the remaining four data points , which approximately lie on a straight line , giving the critical point position at @xmath70 , precisely inline with the value determined in  @xcite .",
    "turning our attention to the haldane - large d qpt , this transition is gaussian and expected to be a third order transition .",
    "furthermore , the critical region is known to be very tight , and not extending more than @xmath71 from the critical point  @xcite .",
    "this results in its characterization being extremely difficult .",
    "in fact , in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors employed a refined dmrg technique in order to access lengths of up to 20,000 spins to determine the critical point to a high degree of accuracy , finding @xmath72 . in  @xcite the critical value",
    "was estimated to be @xmath73 by studying the finite size scaling ( fss ) of the entanglement spectrum for up to @xmath74 , while using monte - carlo simulation the predicted value was found to be @xmath75  @xcite . as the haldane - large d transition is a third order continuous phase transition , we expect a point of inflection in the second derivative of the energy , and consequently , in the first derivative of the ground state and therefore of @xmath52 .",
    "thus , we anticipate , by examining the second derivative of @xmath52 , to find a minimum . using finite size extrapolation , as before ,",
    "even with the best quadratic rather than linear fit , we find the qpt predicted at @xmath76 ( results not shown ) which is a few percent off the value predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite , indicating that the nature of this qpt will require larger sizes to accurately locate its critical point using discord .",
    "however , a curious result appears when studying the second derivative . in fig .",
    "[ dmrg3 ] we show the behavior of @xmath77 within the critical region .",
    "the various symbols correspond to the numerically calculated values , while the solid curves are quadratic lines of best fit for each data set . for all chains with @xmath78",
    "we see the second derivatives cross each other near the same point located approximately at @xmath65 .",
    "smaller chains behave markedly different , although this is in keeping with the behavior of the nel - haldane transition where @xmath53 and 16 were too small to apply finite extrapolation to .",
    "since we expect a point of inflection in the first derivative of the discord , or equivalently , a vanishing value for third order derivative , we conjecture that close to the critical point the second derivative of the discord scales as : @xmath79,\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is an analytic function close to @xmath81 $ ] and @xmath82 is the critical exponent associated with the divergence of the correlation length .",
    "that is , the critical exponent associated to the second derivative of discord equals to zero , and thus , the third derivative vanishes in the thermodynamic limit . this way all the dependence on the parameter @xmath32 is reabsorbed in the correlation length . by fitting our results",
    "we find that the value @xmath83 collapses the data for different lengths as shown in the inset in fig .",
    "[ dmrg3 ] .",
    "the value we find is in agreement with the more accurate result @xmath84 found in ref .",
    "@xcite . therefore ,",
    "if our conjecture is correct , discord is not only able to locate the position of the qpt but also the universal scaling exponents associated with it .",
    "there is an additional parity effect for these even length chains . in the above cases we consider chains such that @xmath85 is odd .",
    "although for all even length chains the spins form nearest neighbor pairs , in this situation we are examining ( the central ) two spins both of which have formed a pair with their other respective nearest neighbors , and not with each other .",
    "this means the correlation between the two central spins is weaker than with their other respective neighbors .",
    "however , the larger we take @xmath51 , the smaller this difference becomes and we see the behavior reported in fig .",
    "[ dmrg ] ( a ) , i.e. increasing qd for increasing l. in contrast , when @xmath85 is even ( i.e. @xmath486 , 10 , 14 ,  ) the two central spins correspond exactly to a dimer formed in the chain , and this results in larger values for the qd that decreases as we increase @xmath51 .",
    "the qualitative behavior remains unaffected and , in fact , for @xmath86 any differences between these situations are negligible .      while the previous section highlighted that using measures of nonclassicality applied to reduced states can capture the thermodynamic properties of systems beyond the paradigmatic spin-@xmath87 models previously studied",
    ", we now turn our attention to the global properties of finite size chains . for spin-1/2 models",
    "the gqd was shown to be remarkably effective at spotlighting the critical nature emerging from spin chains consisting of just @xmath88 spins  @xcite , and was able to accurately recover the correct critical exponents .",
    "furthermore , in this paper we use the reformulation of the global discord expression found in ref .",
    "@xcite which considerably simplifies the optimisation of the local measurement basis .",
    "the calculation of gqd is significantly more involved than the nearest neighbor calculations performed previously and requires us to make as much use of the symmetries present in the system to simplify our calculation ( in fact we remark the calculation of qd was recently shown to be np - complete  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , from here on we assume the chain has periodic boundary conditions , thus making it translationally invariant .",
    "this immediately simplifies our calculation of eq .   as all spins will now be optimized using the same set of angles .",
    "this is true when the ground state does not break spontaneously translational invariance .",
    "when @xmath89 we can determine the gqd employing a full minimization and we find the angles optimizing the gqd correspond exactly to those found in the nearest neighbor calculation , @xmath58 for @xmath90 and @xmath61 , @xmath62 for @xmath91 .",
    "we conjecture that for a chain with periodic boundaries these will be the optimizing angles for all even and odd length chains .",
    "for @xmath92 we calculated the full minimization for a smaller selection of values of @xmath32 and confirmed the conjecture . for larger systems , we calculate the gqd using these known fixed values for the optimizing angles . despite not being accessible to analytic proof , this approach of using numerical confirmation has proven fruitful when calculating such involved quantities  @xcite .",
