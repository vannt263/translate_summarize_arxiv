    "the uncertainty ( indeterminacy ) principle is a basic feature of quantum physics .",
    "it reveals the fundamental difference between quantum and classical descriptions of nature .",
    "the indeterminacy principle was introduced in 1927 by heisenberg who demonstrated the impossibility of simultaneous precise measurement of the canonical quantum observables @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( the coordinate and the momentum ) by positing an approximate relation @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the plank constant , @xmath4 erg.sec .",
    "_ `` the more precisely is the position determined , the less precisely is the momentum known , and vice versa '' _ .",
    "heisenberg considered this inequality as the `` direct descriptive interpretation '' of the canonical commutation relation between the operators of the coordinate and momentum : @xmath5 = i\\hbar$ ] , @xmath5 \\equiv \\hat{x}\\hat{p}_x-\\hat{p}_x\\hat{x}$ ] .",
    "qualitative statements about the repugnance of the precise determination of the coordinate with that of the momentum have been formulated in 1926 also by dirac and jordan ( see refs . in m.jammer , _ the conceptual development of quantum mechanics _ , mc graw - hill , 1967 ) .",
    "let us recall that in quantum physics a physical quantity ( observable ) @xmath6 is represented by a hermitian operator @xmath7 in the hilbert space of states .",
    "soon after the heisenberg paper appeared kennard and weyl proved the inequality ( p_x)^2 ( x)^2 /4 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the variances ( dispersions ) of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , defined by weyl for every quantum state @xmath10 via the formula @xmath11 and similarly is @xmath12 defined .",
    "the matrix element @xmath13 is the mean value of the observable @xmath7 in the state @xmath10 .",
    "the square - root @xmath14 is called standard deviation .    in correspondence with the classical probability theory the standard deviation @xmath15",
    "is considered as a measure for the indeterminacy ( or for the fluctuations ) of the observable @xmath7 in the corresponding state @xmath10 . in 1930",
    "dichburn [ r.dichburn , proc .",
    "royal irish acad . * 39 * , 73 ( 1930 ) ] established the relation between weyl @xmath16 and heisenberg @xmath17 [ namely @xmath18 , and proved that the equality @xmath19 can be achieved for gauss probability distributions only .",
    "they are these distributions for which heisenberg derived his relation , resorting to the properties of the fourier transformation .",
    "the heisenberg - weyl - kennard inequality ( [ hwk ] ) became known as the _ heisenberg uncertainty relation_.    generalization of ( [ hwk ] ) to the case of arbitrary two observables ( hermitian operators @xmath7 and @xmath20 ) was made by robertson in 1929 , ( x)^2(y)^2 ||^2 .",
    "robertson inequality ( [ rur1 ] ) became known again as the heisenberg uncertainty relation for two observables @xmath7 and @xmath20 , and it is regarded as a mathematical formulation of the heisenberg indeterminacy principle for two quantum observables . in view of this inertia and of the significant robertson contribution we shall refer to the relation ( [ rur1 ] ) as heisenberg  robertson inequality or heisenberg  robertson uncertainty relation ( while ( [ hwk ] ) is referred to as heisenberg relation ) .",
    "the heisenberg  robertson uncertainty relation ( [ rur1 ] ) and/or its particular case ( [ hwk ] ) became an irrevocable part of almost every textbook in quantum mechanics .",
    "however from the classical probability theory it is known that for two random quantities one can define three second moments : the variances of each observable and their _ covariance_. in the relations ( [ rur1 ] ) and ( [ hwk ] ) the two variances @xmath7 and @xmath20 are involved only .",
    "this fact was first noted by schrdinger in 1930 , who derived ( using schwartz inequality ) the more general inequality ( x)^2(y)^2 - ( xy)^2    notations , used in the literature , for the covariance ( variance ) , are cov@xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ( var@xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) . in his original paper schrdinger did nt introduce any symbol for the quantity @xmath28 , while for the variance ( mean - square deviation ) he used @xmath29 . ] of @xmath7 and @xmath20 , @xmath30 .",
    "the ratio @xmath31 is called correlation coefficient for two observables . in the classical probability theory",
    "the vanishing covariance is a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for the statistical independence of two random quantities .",
    "nonvanishing covariance means stronger correlation between physical quantities .    in the case of coordinate and momentum observables relation ( [ sur ] ) takes the shorter form of @xmath32 . for the sake of brevity",
    "henceforth we shall work with dimensionless observables @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( instead of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are parameters with dimension of mass and frequency respectively . for @xmath37 and @xmath38 the heisenberg and schrdinger inequalities",
    "read simpler : @xmath39 , ( q)^2(p)^2 - ( qp)^2 .    the schrdinger inequality ( [ sur ] ) is more general and more precise than that of heisenberg  robertson , eq .",
    "( [ rur1 ] ) : the former is reduced to the latter in states with vanishing covariance of @xmath7 and @xmath20 , and the equality in ( [ rur1 ] ) means the equality in ( [ sur ] ) , the inverse being not true .",
    "thus the schrdinger inequality provides a more stringent limitation ( from below ) to the product ot two variances . despite of these advantages the relation ( [ qpsur ] ) and/or ( [ sur ] ) are lacking in almost all text books .",
    "the interest in schrdinger relation has been renewed in the last two decades only ( for the first time , to the best of my knowledge , in ref .",
    " 50 years after its discovery ) in connection with the description and experimental realization of the _ squeezed states",
    "_ ( ss ) of the electromagnetic radiation .",
    "another useful property of the schrdinger uncertainty relation consists in its form - invariance against nondegenerate linear transformations of the two observables .",
    "if one transforms @xmath40 to @xmath41 , @xmath42 one would obtain that the left and the right hand sides of ( [ sur ] ) are transformed in the same manner ( _ covariantly _ )  by multiplication by the factor @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is @xmath45 matrix of the transformation coefficients @xmath46 .",
    "it then follows that if a given state saturates ( [ sur ] ) for @xmath7 and @xmath20 , it saturates ( [ sur ] ) for the transformed observables @xmath41 as well . the covariance of the heisenberg  robertson inequality , eq .",
    "( [ rur1 ] ) , is much more restricted : both its sides are transformed in the same manner under the linear scale transformations of the observables @xmath47 , @xmath48 _ only_. in the case of canonical observables this restricted covariance means that the equality in ( [ hwk ] ) is not invariant under linear canonical transformations , in particular it is not invariant under rotations in the phase plane .",
    "the scale transformations and the rotations form two distinct subgroups of the group of linear canonical transformations .",
    "it is quite natural then to look for another uncertainty relation for @xmath49 and @xmath50 which is covariant ( the equality being invariant ) under the rotations in the phase space .",
    "it turned out that such covariant inequality does exist : it has the simple form of ( q)^2 + ( p)^2 1 .",
    "this inequality is less precise than ( [ qpsur ] ) and ( [ hwk ] ) in the sense that the equality in it entails the equality in both ( [ qpsur ] ) and ( [ hwk ] ) .",
    "the equality in ( [ nner ] ) is invariant under rotations in the phase plane .    the most precise inequality , the schrdinger one , eq .",
    "( [ qpsur ] ) , is most symmetric  the equality in ( [ qpsur ] ) is invariant under both subgroups ( rotations and scale transformations ) of the group of linear canonical transformations of @xmath37 and @xmath38 . for two arbitrary observables ( hermitian operators ) the inequality ( [ nner ] )",
    "takes the form @xmath51\\ra|$ ] .",
    "the interest in minimization of uncertainty relations has increased after the discovery of _ coherent states _ ( cs ) of the electromagnetic field in 1963 ( independently by the american physicists klauder , glauber and sudarshan  see refs . in ) , and especially after the discovery of _ squeezed states _ ( ss ) .",
    "next we consider the basic properties of states , that minimize heisenberg and schrdinger inequalities for the canonical pair @xmath52 ( subsections * a * and * b * ) and for some non - canonical observables : the spin and quasi - spin components ( subsection * c * ) .",

    "he found , that the measurement accuracy can be significantly increased if laser light used in the interferometer is replaced with squeezed light , described by @xmath144 .",
    "this fact motivated the search of squeezed states for other pairs of ( noncanonical ) observables @xmath40 , i.e. of field states with reduced quantum fluctuations of @xmath7 or @xmath20 . in paper",
    "it was proposed to construct ss for two general observables as states , that minimize schrdinger inequality ( [ sur ] ) .",
    "such minimizing states were called @xmath7@xmath20 generalized intelligent states , or @xmath7@xmath20 schrdinger intelligent states . following they",
    "could be called @xmath7@xmath20 correlated states .",
    "the inequality ( [ sur ] ) is minimized in a state @xmath10 if and only if @xmath10 is an eigenstate of ( generally _ complex _ ) combination of @xmath7 and @xmath20 , i.e. if @xmath191 satisfies the equation ( u+v^)|= z| , where @xmath192 , @xmath193 .",
    "this equation shows that at @xmath194 ( @xmath195 ) the solution @xmath196 must tend to the eigenstate of @xmath7 ( of @xmath20 ) , i.e. at @xmath194 ( @xmath195 ) quantum fluctuations of @xmath7 ( @xmath20 ) must tend to zero .",
    "therefore the solutions @xmath197 to ( [ |zuv > ] ) , when exist , are ideal squeezed states for the corresponding two observables ( shortly @xmath7@xmath20 ss ) .",

    "generators of @xmath200 and @xmath201 have important boson / photon realizations ( see , e.g. quant - ph/9912084 and refs . therein ) .",
    "for example , the @xmath200 generators can be realized by means of one pair of boson annihilation and creation operators @xmath56 , @xmath72 as    @xmath204    states @xmath202 for this realization ( here @xmath205 ) can exhibit squeezing in fluctuations not only of @xmath206 and @xmath207 , but also of @xmath37 and @xmath38 . in a certain range of parameters @xmath208 and @xmath209 squeezing may occur for @xmath206 and @xmath38 ( or for @xmath207 and @xmath37 simultaneously ( joint squeezing for two noncommuting observables ) .",

    "the answer to this question is positive : such states with optimally balanced fluctuations of the three observables @xmath225 ( @xmath226 ) ( states with maximal @xmath227 or @xmath228 intelligency ) are the known klauder - perelomov @xmath200 cs ( radcliffe - gilmore @xmath201 cs ) _ only _ ( proof in quant - ph/9912084 and in j. phys . a 31 ( 1998 ) 8041 ) . for the above",

    "we have seen that @xmath229 minimize the schrdinger relation for @xmath37 and @xmath38 as well .",
    "hence the squeezed vacuum states are the unique states that minimize schrdinger inequalities for four pairs of observables @xmath215@xmath216 and @xmath49@xmath50 simultaneously .",
    "they are these states that was used by caves to increase the accuracy of the interferometric measurements .",
    "the heisenberg and schrdinger uncertainty relations reveal quantitatively the statistical correlations between two observables in one and the same state .",
    "two natural questions can be immediately formulated : are there statistical correlations a ) between several observables in one state ?",
    "b ) between observables in two and more states ?    the positive answer to the first question was given by robertson in 1934 [ phys .",
    "rev . * 46 * 794 ( 1934 ) ] by proving of the inequality c , where @xmath230 is the matrix of all second moments ( the uncertainty , the covariance or dispersion matrix ) of @xmath74 observables @xmath231 , and @xmath232 is the matrix of mean values of their commutators , @xmath233 , @xmath234\\ra$ ] . at @xmath235 robertson uncertainty relation ( [ rur ] ) coincides with the schrdinger one , eq .",
