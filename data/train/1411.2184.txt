    "magnetic field has important effects in low - mass star formation .",
    "it can launch a collimated jet but may suppress the formation of a rotationally supported ( accretion ) disk ( rsd ) in the early phase of star formation .",
    "in current theory , gravitational collapse of a rotating magnetized cloud core produces a flattened envelope and an hourglass field morphology around a central source ( i.e. , protostar ) ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the flattened envelope is not rotationally supported and is thus called pseudodisk . in the flattened envelope , rotation velocity increases toward the center , generating a toroidal field in the inner part @xcite .",
    "however , the pinched geometry of the magnetic field in the flattened envelope generates a magnetic braking , suppressing the formation of a rsd around the center @xcite .",
    "one possible solution is to have a misalignment between rotation axis and magnetic field axis @xcite .",
    "observations of linearly polarized thermal dust emission toward low - mass class 0 systems have revealed magnetic field morphologies of the envelope in support of the above theoretical picture . they have revealed an hourglass field morphology in , e.g. , ngc 1333 iras 4a @xcite and",
    "l 1157 @xcite .",
    "they have also showed a tentative detection of toroidal fields near the center in , e.g. , ngc 1333 iras 4a @xcite and iras 16293 - 2422 b @xcite .",
    "moreover , misalignment between rotation axis and magnetic field axis could be common , as suggested in @xcite . however , further observations are still needed to confirm the field morphology near the center and the misalignment .",
    "on the other hand , the field morphology in protostellar jet is poorly determined due to a lack of polarization detection . in current jet - launching models",
    "@xcite , poloidal field is needed to launch the jet and toroidal field is needed to collimate the jet .",
    "therefore , the jet is expected to be magnetized with a helical field . for high - mass systems , the jet can emit synchrotron radiation , allowing us to map the field morphology with polarization observation in synchrotron continuum @xcite . for low - mass systems , the jet can emit molecular line emission @xcite .",
    "line polarization has been detected in molecular outflows in low - mass systems , e.g. , ngc 1333 iras 4a @xcite and high - mass systems , e.g. , dr 21 @xcite .",
    "it is attributed to the goldreich - kylafis ( gk ) effect @xcite , and thus can be used to infer the field morphology in the molecular outflows .",
    "it can also be used to infer the field morphology in the jet .",
    "hh 211 is a nearby ( 280 pc ) low - mass system , in which a flattened envelope has been detected , a rsd has been claimed , and a collimated jet has been detected in sio and co down to the launching point inside an outflow cavity ( gueth et al .",
    "1999 ; lee et al .",
    "2009 , hereafter @xcite ) .",
    "it is young in the class 0 phase , with significant material still in the flattened envelope and a mass of only @xmath0 0.06 for the central source .",
    "the jet is almost in the plane of the sky and the flattened envelope is almost edge - on , providing the best view for the fields . here ,",
    "we report detections of thermal dust polarization in the flattened envelope and line polarization in the jet , and discuss possible field morphologies in this system .",
    "polarization observation toward hh 211 was carried out with the submillimeter array ( sma ) @xcite on 2013 november 28 in the extended configuration , using a dual - receiver mode with the 345 ghz and 400 ghz receivers .",
    "sio ( @xmath1 ) , co ( @xmath2 ) , and so ( ) lines were observed simultaneously with continuum .",
    "here , we only present the results in continuum and sio that show polarization detection .",
    "the receivers have two sidebands , lower and upper , covering the frequency range from 335.6 to 337.6 ghz and from 345.6 to 347.6 ghz , respectively . combining the line - free portions of the two sidebands results in a total bandwidth of @xmath0 3.7 ghz centered at @xmath0 341.6 ghz for the continuum .",
    "the baselines of the array have projected lengths ranging from @xmath0 27 to 224 m. the primary beam has a size of @xmath0 .",
    "the correlator was set up to have a velocity resolution of @xmath0 1.4 .",
    "quasar 3c84 was used as a gain , a bandpass , and a polarization calibrator .",
    "its fractional linear polarization was determined to be @xmath0 0.1% , which is the limit of detectability with the sma .",
    "the absolute flux scale was determined by using the 3c84 flux ( 6.3 jy ) in the sma database , with a flux uncertainty of @xmath3 15% .",
    "the visibility data were reduced , with the bandpass and gain calibrations done with the mir package , and the polarization and flux calibration done with the miriad package .",
    "the antenna leakages were found to be up to @xmath0 3% except for antenna 7 which is @xmath0 7% .",
    "the calibrated visibility data were imaged with the miriad package . with natural weighting ,",
    "the synthesized beam has a size of @xmath4 at a position angle ( p.a . ) of @xmath0 @xmath588 .",
    "the rms noise levels in different maps are given later in figure captions .",
    "at 341.6 ghz , the continuum map shows a flattened structure within a radius of @xmath0 of the central source , roughly perpendicular to the jet axis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cont_pol ] ) .",
    "the source is assumed to be at the peak position of the continuum , which is @xmath6 , @xmath7 , consistent with the position found at higher resolution @xcite .",
    "the jet is known to be bended and wiggling , with a mean axis having a p.a .",
    "of 114@xmath84 @xcite .",
    "the continuum has a total flux density of 220@xmath830 mjy , consistent with the value found before .",
    "the center is unresolved with a peak flux density of 112 .",
    "a fit to the visibility amplitude versus @xmath9-distance plot of the continuum requires two circular gaussian components ; an extended component with a size of @xmath0 and a compact component with a size of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , as discussed before , the continuum traces the thermal dust emission from a flattened envelope and a possible compact disk around the source @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a faint secondary source was detected at @xmath0 to the southwest of the central source at higher resolution .",
    "however , this source can not be resolved here .",
    "the envelope is slightly asymmetric , extending further to the sw than to the ne ( probably partly because of the secondary source ) and further to the se than to the nw .",
    "linear polarization is detected in the thermal dust emission in the se , ne , sw , and nw parts of the envelope , as shown by the polarization intensity map and vectors in figure [ fig : cont_pol]a .",
    "the angles of the polarization vectors have an uncertainty of @xmath0 13 .",
    "the degree of polarization reaches @xmath0 30% at the edges of the envelope , as found in other systems e.g. , ngc 1333 iras 4a @xcite . in the se part , the detection of the polarized emission has a peak of more than 3@xmath10 and is thus real . in other parts ,",
    "the detections are 2 to 3@xmath10 and thus should be considered as tentative .",
    "figure [ fig : cont_pol]b shows the magnetic field lines in the envelope obtained by rotating the polarization vectors by 90 .",
    "the field morphology is complicated because the field lines have different orientations in different regions . along the major axis ,",
    "the sw field lines are roughly aligned with the jet axis slightly pinched toward the source .",
    "however , the ne field lines , which are closer to the central source than the sw field lines , are almost perpendicular to the jet axis . along the minor axis ,",
    "the nw field lines appear to be roughly perpendicular to the jet axis . however , the se field lines , which are further away from the central source than the nw field lines , appear to be roughly aligned with the jet axis .",
    "as mentioned earlier , current polarization observations support a gravitational collapse model of a rotating magnetized cloud core for low - mass star formation . for the first comparison ,",
    "we compare to a simple version of such model , in which the field lines are initially poloidal with the field axis aligned with the rotation axis . because of the gravitational collapse ,",
    "the field lines are pinched toward the source , forming an hourglass field morphology .",
    "moreover , toroidal fields are generated by rotation in the flattened envelope near the source around the rotation axis .",
    "figure [ fig : cont_pol]c shows the 3d view toward the inner part of such a model from @xcite , where the toroidal field lines have formed .",
    "the model has a spatial scale about 4 times larger because it is 5 - 10 times older than hh 211 , and is thus only used as an illustration of the complex structure of the magnetic field in the envelope .",
    "the model has an edge - on view , appropriate for hh 211 .",
    "it is rotated with the field axis ( black lines ) aligned with the jet axis in hh 211 .",
    "in addition , it has the same rotation sense as observed in hh 211 , with the blueshifted part in the sw and redshifted part in the ne @xcite .",
    "the observed field morphology is complicated , but may not be incompatible with the model , as it predicts different orientation depending on the region / distance .",
    "the nw field lines can trace the toroidal fields in the flattened envelope generated by the rotation .",
    "the se field lines are further away from the center and thus can trace the fields at the outer edge of the flattened envelope , where the fields are still mainly poloidal .",
    "the sw field lines are slightly pinched and thus can trace the hourglass field lines dragged in by the gravitational collapse .",
    "the ne field lines are located closer to the source , where the hourglass field lines are expected to be dragged in more by the gravitational collapse and thus bent to be roughly perpendicular to the jet axis ( see also fig 4a in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . note that it is also possible that the field lines there trace the toroidal fields generated by the rotation , as claimed in the case of ngc 1333 iras 4a where field lines were also detected perpendicular to the jet axis @xcite .",
    "in addition , the ne / sw asymmetry could also be partly due to the presence of a secondary source . the polarization is not detected in all parts of the envelope , probably because of depolarization due to the complicated field morphology and our insufficient angular resolution @xcite .",
    "further observations at higher sensitivity and resolution are needed to confirm the different field orientations in different regions .",
    "hourglass field morphologies have been seen in other class 0 systems , e.g. , ngc 1333 iras 4a ( a binary system ) at @xmath0 400 au resolution @xcite and",
    "l 1157 at 300 - 525 au resolution @xcite . at higher , @xmath0 180 au , resolution ,",
    "toroidal field lines have also been detected tentatively in ngc 1333 iras 4a within 300 au of the center @xcite . in hh 211 ,",
    "a partial hourglass field morphology has also been seen at @xmath0 1000 au resolution , with a pinched field morphology in the sw @xcite .",
    "here at higher , @xmath0 170 au , resolution , we may have detected not only the hourglass field morphology in the sw further in but also the toroidal field lines in the flattened envelope within 300 au of the center .",
    "thus , higher resolution observations are needed to reveal the toroidal fields , likely because the rotation dominates only in the very inner region in the class 0 phase .    in current theory , the pinched geometry of the magnetic field in the flattened envelope can produce a magnetic braking , preventing a rsd to be formed at the center @xcite .",
    "however , such a rsd must have formed in order to launch the jet , as claimed in @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that a magnetic - field - rotation misalignment in a larger size scale could help the formation of the disk @xcite . in the larger size scale in the cloud scale ( arc - minute scale ) @xcite , the magnetic field lines are found to be roughly north - south oriented , neither aligned with nor perpendicular to the jet axis .",
    "however , the rotation axis in this scale is found to be roughly aligned with the jet axis @xcite .",
    "thus , there is a misalignment of @xmath0 30 between the large - scale field axis and the rotation axis , and it may help the disk formation .",
    "figure [ fig : siojet ] shows the blueshifted ( black contours ) and redshifted ( gray contours ) components of the jet in sio , rotated clockwise to be aligned with the x - axis . as seen in @xcite , the jet is highly collimated and consists of a chain of knotty shocks .",
    "the figure also shows the polarization intensity map and vectors in the jet in the sio line .",
    "the angles of the polarization vectors have an uncertainty of @xmath0 13 .",
    "the line polarization can be attributed to the gk effect . in hh 211 ,",
    "the jet lies close to the plane of the sky . for the sio j=8 - 7 emission ,",
    "the optical depth is close to 1 and the radiative transition rate is greater than the collision rate in most regions @xcite .",
    "all these are optimal for polarization detection and thus the polarization degree could exceed 10% @xcite , as seen in the observation .",
    "two polarization detections , one in knot rk2 and one in between knots bk2 and bk3 , are greater than 3@xmath10 , and thus should be real .",
    "their polarization vectors have different orientations , with the former parallel to the jet axis and the latter inclined by @xmath0 50 to the jet axis .",
    "other detections are below 3@xmath10 and thus should be considered as tentative . no polarization is detected toward the bright innermost pair of knots probably because of the higher density there than other regions .    according to the gk effect , the field could be either parallel or perpendicular to the polarization vector , depending on the angle @xmath11 between the velocity flow axis and the polarization vector @xcite . if @xmath12 , the field direction is parallel to the polarization vector . if @xmath13 , then there is a 90 ambiguity in the field direction . in the jet",
    ", the velocity flow axis is the same as the jet axis .",
    "the polarization vectors in between knots bk2 and bk3 have @xmath14 50 , thus the field lines there are parallel to the polarization vectors , highly inclined to the jet axis , and thus could be helical . in knot rk2 , the polarization vectors are almost aligned with the velocity flow axis . in this case , the field lines could be either parallel or perpendicular to the polarization vectors .",
    "therefore , the fields there could be either poloidal or toroidal .",
    "in knot rk2 , there are sufficient number of polarization vectors for us to estimate the magnetic field strength there . according to @xcite and @xcite , we can estimate the field strength in the plane of the sky with the following formula @xmath15 the mass density @xmath16 g with @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the velocity dispersion along the line of sight @xmath18 @xcite . with the dispersion of the polarization angle @xmath19 ( including the uncertainty in the angle of the polarization vectors ) , we have @xmath20 35@xmath21 mg . as discussed earlier , the field there could be toroidal . according to @xcite ,",
    "the toroidal field strength in an originally unshocked jet material could be @xmath22 7 mg for the hh 211 jet , which has a radius of @xmath3 20 au @xcite .",
    "thus , if the field in knot rk2 is purely toroidal , our estimated field strength there is about 5 times as high , probably not unreasonable considering a shock compression .",
    "the magnetic pressure due to this toroidal field is @xmath23 dyne . the thermal pressure there is @xmath24 dyne with @xmath25 k @xcite , much lower than the magnetic pressure .",
    "hence , the jet material there should be well confined by the magnetic field , if the field there is really toroidal .",
    "magnetic field morphology in protostellar jet is still poorly determined due to a lack of polarization detection .",
    "previously , @xcite detected linear polarization in the synchrotron jet hh 80 - 81 from the high - mass protostar iras 18162 - 2048 and found that the field lines there are mainly aligned with the jet axis .",
    "they saw an increase in polarization degree toward the jet edges and argued it to be due to helical field toward the jet edges .",
    "however , the jet with the polarization detection is far at @xmath0 0.5 pc away from the source and has an extremely large transverse width of @xmath0 40000 au , and thus might not trace the intrinsic jet coming from the source @xcite . in comparison ,",
    "our polarization detections are within 2000 au ( @xmath0 ) of the source .",
    "the jet is located inside an outflow cavity and has a transverse width of @xmath3 40 au @xcite , as expected for a jet coming from a low - mass protostar .",
    "since the polarization detections here show different orientations in different regions , further observations with alma at higher sensitivity are really needed to confirm them and to determine the field morphology .    in conclusion",
    ", we might have detected for the first time polarized sio line emission in the jet due to the gk effect .",
    "if confirmed , our detection will open an perspective that gk effect can be used to infer magnetic field morphology in the jet in the early phase of star formation , in which the jet is primarily molecular .",
    "the inferred field morphology can then be used to constrain the jet launching models .",
