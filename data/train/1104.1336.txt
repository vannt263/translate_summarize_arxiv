    "in recent years diffuse interface models have been successfully used to describe the flow of two or more immiscible fluids both for theoretical studies and numerical simulations .",
    "one fundamental advantage of these models is that they are able to describe topological transitions like droplet coalescence or droplet break - up in a natural way .",
    "these ideas go even back to works of van der waals and korteweg , cf .",
    "@xcite for a review and further references . in the case of two",
    "incompressible , viscous newtonian fluids the basic diffuse interface model is the so - called `` model h '' , cf .",
    "hohenberg and halperin  @xcite .",
    "it leads to the navier - stokes / cahn - hilliard system @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the density , @xmath2 is the mean velocity , @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the pressure , and @xmath5 is an order parameter related to the concentration of the fluids ( e.g. the concentration difference or the concentration of one component ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath6 is the viscosity of the mixture , @xmath7 is a constant related to the surface energy density , @xmath8 is a ( small ) parameter , which is related to the `` thickness '' of the interfacial region , @xmath9 is a homogeneous free energy density and @xmath10 is the chemical potential .",
    "capillary forces due to surface tension are modeled by an extra contribution @xmath11 in the stress tensor leading to the term on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : nsch1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , we note that in the modeling diffusion of the fluid components is taken into account .",
    "therefore @xmath12 is appearing in ( [ eq : nsch3 ] ) , where @xmath13 is the mobility coefficient .",
    "one of the fundamental modelling assumptions is that the densities of both components as well as the density of the mixture @xmath1 are constant .",
    "of course , this restricts the applicability of the model to situations when density differences are negligible .",
    "gurtin et al .",
    "@xcite derived this model in the framework of rational continuum mechanics and showed that it satisfies the second law of thermodynamics in a mechanical version based on a local dissipation inequality .",
    "lowengrub and truskinovsky  @xcite derived a thermodynamically consistent extension of the model h for the case of different densities , which leads to the system : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the bulk viscosity coefficient . here",
    "the free energy has the density @xmath17 per unit volume .",
    "a simplified version of this model has been successfully used for numerical studies , cf .",
    "lee et al .  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , there are  to the best of the authors knowledge  no discrete schemes available which are based on the full model -",
    ". this may be due to fundamental new difficulties compared with model h - .",
    "for instance , the velocity field @xmath2 is no longer divergence free and therefore no solution concept is available which avoids to determine the pressure @xmath4 .",
    "at least analytically , these difficulties could be overcome , see abels  @xcite for existence of weak solutions .",
    "mathematically the coupling of the navier - stokes - and the cahn - hilliard part - is much stronger , for instance the pressure @xmath4 enters the equation for the chemical potential , and the linearized system is very different from the linearization of model h , cf .",
    "abels  @xcite , where strong solutions locally in time are constructed .",
    "alternative generalizations of the model h for the case of different densities were presented and discussed by boyer  @xcite and ding et al .",
    "@xcite . the model by ding et al .",
    "consists of  - , but now for a variable density @xmath18 . in order to justify this generalization",
    "they start from the mass balance equation @xmath19 for the individual fluids @xmath20 and define the mean velocity @xmath2 of the mixture as _ volume averaged velocity _",
    "@xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the volume fraction of fluid @xmath23",
    ". then yields @xmath24 cf . section  [ eq : derivation ] below .",
    "in contrast to that lowengrub and truskinovsky define the mean velocity @xmath2 as _ mass averaged / barycentric velocity _",
    "@xmath25 , which yields @xmath26 the incompressibility relation of course has advantages with respect to numerical simulations ",
    "see the computations related to the model by ding et al . in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , neither global nor local energy inequalities are known to hold for - when @xmath1 is not constant .",
    "the model by boyer is more complicated .",
    "but it is derived using a volume averaged mean velocity , which leads to a divergence free mean velocity field too .",
    "the further derivation of boyer differs from the one in @xcite and ours since the starting point are the equations for the conservation of linear momentum of each single fluid .",
    "also for this model neither global nor local energy inequalities seem to be known , cf . also @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to derive a thermodynamically consistent generalization of - to the case of non - matched densities based on a solenoidal velocity field @xmath2 .",
    "more precisely , we will derive the system @xmath27 together with @xmath28 where the order parameter @xmath29 stands for the difference of the volume fractions @xmath30 , @xmath20 . ] . here",
    "the free energy of the system has the density @xmath31 ( per unit volume ) .",
    "we note that the first equation in the latter system is equivalent to @xmath32 where @xmath33 , cf . section  [ eq : derivation ] below . in comparison with",
    "the system derived in @xcite there is the additional term @xmath34 in the equation for the linear momentum .",
    "this term vanishes in the case of matched densities , i.e. , @xmath35 .",
    "but this term is crucial in the case of non - matched densities for consistency with thermodynamics .",
    "we note that in contrast to the model by lowengrub and truskinovsky - the usual continuity equation is not part of our system .",
    "nevertheless there is conservation of mass in our system .",
    "more precisely , we have @xmath36 and in section  [ eq : derivation ] it will be shown that in fact individual masses are conserved .",
    "note that @xmath37 is the specific density of fluid @xmath20 and that @xmath38 .",
    "we emphasize that according to equation   the ( volume averaged ) velocity @xmath2 does not describe the flux of the density . in our model",
    "the flux of the density consists of the two parts : @xmath39 , describing the transport by the mean velocity , and a relative flux @xmath40 related to diffusion of the components .",
    "hence the diffusion of the components relative to the mean velocity leads to a diffusion of the mass density in the case that @xmath41 .",
    "moreover , we note that in the classical model h effects related to diffusion of the components can play an important role and can lead to ostwald ripening effects and disappearance of small droplets , cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section  [ eq : derivation ] we will derive the generalization of model h , described above in the framework of rational continuum mechanics . first we will use a local dissipation inequality and a choice of the energy flux as in @xcite to derive restrictions for the form of the stress tensor and the chemical potential , which finally leads to our model after suitable constitutive assumptions .",
    "then we briefly discuss the changes in the derivation if the energy flux is not specified at the beginning and liu s lagrange multiplier method is used , cf .",
    "@xcite . in section  [ sec :",
    "onsager ] , we present a third approach to derive a thermodynamically consistent model , this time based on onsager s variational principle .",
    "we consider the more general situation when either the system is subjected to gravitational forces or when one additional soluble species is present in both fluids . in the latter case ,",
    "transport effects across the interface are taken into account , too , and we derive a diffuse interface analogue of henry s law , cf . section [ sec : onsager ] .    in section  [ sec : sharpinterface ]",
    "we discuss the sharp interface asymptotics in the limit @xmath42 for the diffuse interface model together with a soluble species .",
    "this is done by using the method of formally matched asymptotics .",
    "we show that the limit system depends essentially on the choice and the scaling of the mobility .",
    "actually , we consider four cases related to choosing the mobility degenerate or non - degenerate and letting the mobility tend to zero or not .",

    "moreover , the interface is transported by the velocity of the fluid , i.e. , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the normal velocity of @xmath45 .",
    "if a soluble species with density @xmath52 is present , we obtain the classical henry condition for the jump of the concentrations of the soluble species .    in the case of a constant mobility ,",
    "we obtain in the limit @xmath42 that the momentum balance in the bulk is given as @xmath53 in this case the diffusive flux @xmath54 enters the momentum balance , cf . @xcite . at the interface",

    "degenerate mobility the evolution of the interface is governed by the surface diffusion law @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the laplace - beltrami operator of @xmath45 and @xmath62 is a diffusion coefficient related to @xmath59 .",

    "in particular the surface flux @xmath64 enters the momentum balance at the interface . in section [ sec : energy ]",
    "we prove that energy estimates are valid for sufficiently smooth solutions of the sharp interface models .",
    "finally , several important identities for the formally matched asymptotics calculations are shown in the appendix .",

    "in order to derive the diffuse interface model , one assumes a partial mixing of the macroscopically immiscible fluids in a thin interfacial region . therefore let us introduce some terminology related to mixtures . in the following",
    "the fluids are labeled by @xmath20 and they fill a domain @xmath65 .",
    "the total mass density of the mixture is denoted by @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , @xmath66 denotes the mass density of the fluid @xmath23 , i.e. , @xmath67 is the mass of the fluid @xmath23 contained in a set @xmath68 and we obtain @xmath69 .",
    "moreover , we denote by @xmath70 the _ mass concentration _ and note that @xmath71 .    denoting by @xmath72 the mass flux of fluid @xmath23 , the mass balance equation in local form",
    "is given by @xmath73 defining the velocities @xmath74 , @xmath20 , of the single fluids as @xmath75 the mass balance equation can be rewritten as @xmath76 in what follows we assume that the volume occupied by a given amount of mass of the single fluids does not change after mixing , i.e. , the excess volume due to mixing is zero .",
    "if @xmath77 is the specific ( constant ) density of the unmixed fluid @xmath23 , we introduce @xmath78 .",
    "the assumption that the excess volume is zero results in @xmath79 expressed in terms of the mass concentrations @xmath80 and @xmath81 , condition ( [ volin ] ) reads as @xmath82 introducing the mass concentration difference @xmath83 , the above relation implies that @xmath84 with a function @xmath85 defined via @xmath86 we remark that possible choices for the order parameter in the phase field model are the mass concentration difference @xmath5 , the density difference @xmath87 or the difference of volume fractions @xmath88    we now introduce a suitable averaged velocity of the mixture .",
    "in contrast to the _ mass averaged / barycentric velocity _ @xmath89 given by @xmath90 , cf .",

    ". hence the classical continuity equation does not hold with respect to the velocity @xmath2 .",
    "this reflects the fact that we allow for mass diffusion in the system .    instead of @xmath5",
    ", one could use @xmath107 as order - parameter .",
    "because of @xmath108 and @xmath109 , @xmath110 , we can also assume that @xmath111 and @xmath112 . in order to have flexibility in the choice of the order parameter , we assume in the following that @xmath113 is any suitable order parameter such that @xmath114 and @xmath115 for some constitutive functions @xmath116 . here",
    "@xmath117 is the density difference .",
    "possible choices are @xmath118 as above , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 .",
    "then @xmath121 is equivalent to @xmath122    as in gurtin et al .",
    "@xcite , we assume that the inertia and kinetic energy due to the motion of the fluid relative to the gross motion is negligible .",
    "therefore we consider the mixture as a single fluid with velocity @xmath2 , which satisfies the law of conservation of linear momentum of continuum mechanics with respect to the volume averaged velocity . the density and the stress tensor",
    "are assumed to depend on additional internal variables like @xmath113 and @xmath123 .",

    "this means that the change of total energy in time is bounded by the working due to macroscopic and microscopic stresses and the change of energy due to diffusion .",

    "first of all , multiplying ( [ eq : conservationlinmomentum ] ) with @xmath2 and using ( [ eq : diffeq1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath168 moreover , @xmath169 and @xmath170 because of ( [ eq : diffeq1 ] ) and where we have used @xmath171 thus we conclude that ( [ eq : localdiss ] ) is equivalent to @xmath172 where we have used @xmath173 .    in order to motivate the constitutive assumptions",
    ", we will derive some restrictions for the constitutive relations specifying @xmath174 by an argument typical for rational continuum mechanics : to this end , we assume that @xmath175 are functions of @xmath176 only .",
    "moreover , we assume that @xmath177 is symmetric . invoking general external forces and mass supplies in the equations ,",
    "one argues that @xmath178 @xmath179 can attain arbitrary values for a given point in space and time and since @xmath180 and @xmath159 do not depend on @xmath181 , we conclude from ( [ eq : dissinequality ] ) that @xmath182 necessarily . in particular , @xmath159 depends only on @xmath183 .",
    "hence ( [ eq : dissinequality ] ) reduces to @xmath184 where @xmath185 .",
    "since the skew part of @xmath186 can attain arbitrary values independent of @xmath187 and @xmath188 we conclude that @xmath189 and therefore @xmath190 thus @xmath191 and therefore @xmath192 for some @xmath193 .",
    "on the other hand , the first term after the equality sign in ( [ eq : dissinequality2 ] ) is linear in @xmath161 and @xmath194 and @xmath10 are assumed to be independent of @xmath161 .",
    "therefore the first term in ( [ eq : dissinequality2 ] ) has to vanish to satisfy ( [ eq : dissinequality2 ] ) in general and @xmath195 finally , the local dissipation inequality is satisfied if and only if @xmath196 here @xmath197 is also called viscous stress tensor since it corresponds to irreversible changes of the energy due to friction in the fluids .    _ constitutive assumptions : _ motivated by newton s rheological law , cf",

    "usually we take the difference of volume fractions as order parameter .",
    "this has the advantage that the mass difference depends linearly on the order parameter and as usual in phase field models the values @xmath231 correspond to unmixed `` pure '' phases .",

    "we now assume a dissipation inequality @xmath237 for every volume @xmath143 transported with the flow for some general _ energy flux _",
    "@xmath238 , which will be specified later .",
    "then the equivalent local form is @xmath239 because of the conservation law ( [ eq : flux ] ) , we conclude that for every scalar function @xmath240 the inequality @xmath241 has to be valid . using ( [ eq : conservationlinmomentum ] ) , ( [ eq : id1 ] ) , ( [ eq : id2 ] ) we obtain that ( [ eq : localdiss2 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath242 where we have used @xmath173 . making use of ( [ eq : id3 ] )",
