    "beam emittance in a storage ring is an important parameter for characterising machine performance . in the case of a light source , for example",
    ", the brightness of the synchrotron radiation produced by a beam of electrons is directly dependent on the horizontal and vertical emittances of the beam and is one of the main figures of merit for users .",
    "second generation light sources had natural emittances of order 100 nm . over the years",
    ", significant improvements in lattice designs have been achieved ( see fig .  [ figlightsourceemittance ] ) , motivated largely by user requirements ; third generation light sources now typically aim for natural emittances of just a few nanometres . in the case of colliders for high energy physics ,",
    "one of the main figures of merit is the luminosity , which is a measure of the rate of particle collisions .",
    "lower emittances allow smaller beam sizes at the interaction point , leading to higher particle density in the colliding bunches , and higher luminosity for the same total number of particles in the beam .",
    "there are of course ways of improving the brightness of a light source and the luminosity of a collider without reducing the emittances : in both cases , for example , the beam current could be increased . however , beam currents are generally limited by collective effects such as impedance - driven instabilities , touschek scattering , or ( for colliders ) beam - beam effects . designing and operating a storage ring for maximum performance involves a good understanding and control of effects that impact the beam emittances .    in this note",
    ", we shall consider the emittance of electron ( and positron ) storage rings : because of synchrotron radiation effects , lepton storage rings are able to achieve very small emittances ( of order 1 nm horizontal emittance , and less than 10 pm vertical emittance )",
    ". we shall begin in section  [ section1 ] by reviewing some of the key features of beam dynamics in the absence of synchrotron radiation .",
    "in particular , an important property of the dynamics in such cases is that the particle motion is symplectic : this has the consequence that the beam emittances ( which characterise the phase space volume occupied by the particles in a beam ) are conserved as the beam moves around the storage ring .",
    "we shall then show that , in a classical approximation , radiation effects lead to damping of the emittances .",
    "we shall derive expressions for the exponential damping times .",
    "then , we shall discuss how quantum effects of synchrotron radiation lead to excitation of the beam emittances . as a result , the emittances of beams in electron ( or positron ) storage rings reach equilibrium values determined by the beam energy and lattice design .",
    "in section  [ section2 ] we shall apply the expression for the natural emittance derived in section  [ section1 ] to particular styles of lattice design .",
    "in particular , we shall consider fodo , double bend achromat , theoretical minimum emittance , and multi - bend achromat lattices .",
    "double bend achromats are of particular interest for light sources , because they achieve low natural emittance ( leading to high brightness ) while providing long , dispersion - free ( or low dispersion ) straight sections that are ideal locations for insertion devices such as undulators or wigglers @xcite .",
    "insertion devices are useful for providing intense beams of synchrotron radiation with specific properties .    in a planar storage ring , the vertical emittance is dominated by alignment and tuning errors , rather than by the design of the lattice . in section  [ section3 ]",
    "we shall discuss how the vertical emittance is related to a range of errors , including steering errors , tilt errors on quadrupoles and vertical alignment errors on sextupoles .",
    "betatron coupling and vertical dispersion are important features of the dynamics in this context , and both will be discussed .",
    "optimisation of a lattice design for a low - emittance storage ring will generally involve simulations to characterise the sensitivity of the vertical emittance to different types of machine error . for this , techniques are needed for accurate computation of the equilibrium emittances from models in which different errors can be included",
    ". we shall consider three techniques that are widely used for emittance computation , discussing the envelope method in particular in some detail .",
    "finally , we shall mention briefly some of the issues associated with operational tuning of a storage ring for low - emittance operation .",
    "in this section , we shall review the relevant aspects of beam dynamics needed for understanding the effects of synchrotron radiation",
    ". our focus will be on electron ( or positron ) synchrotron storage rings .",
    "initially , we shall neglect radiation effects ; then , we shall include the emission of synchrotron radiation as a perturbation to the motion of individual particles .",
    "this approach is valid if radiation effects are relatively weak , which means that the energy lost by a particle through radiation in one synchrotron period should be small compared to the total energy of a particle .",
    "this is almost invariably the case for practical storage rings .",
    "we shall consider only incoherent synchrotron radiation , in other words we shall assume that the motion of each particle and the radiation that it produces can be considered independently of all other particles in the beam . in some regimes ( including , for example , in free electron lasers ) particles generate radiation coherently , leading to a strong enhancement of the radiation produced by a beam .",
    "generally , some special efforts are needed to achieve the generation of coherent synchrotron radiation with sufficient intensity that it has a measurable impact on the beam ; we shall not discuss such situations here .",
    "briefly , we shall proceed as follows .",
    "the symplectic motion of particles in an accelerator ( i.e.  motion neglecting synchrotron radiation and collective effects ) is conveniently described using action - angle variables .",
    "we shall define these variables , and use them to review the key features of particle motion in synchrotron storage rings .",
    "we shall then include the effects of synchrotron radiation , initially in a classical approximation , leading to expressions for the energy lost per turn in a storage ring , and the damping times for the horizontal , vertical and longitudinal emittances .",
    "finally , we shall discuss the effects of quantum excitation , and derive results for the equilibrium beam emittances .",
    "these results will be used in section  [ section2 ] , where we consider how the equilibrium emittances are affected by the lattice design in a storage ring .      .",

[ figcoordinatesystem2 ] ) .",

    "@xmath24 this means that ( continuing to neglect radiation and collective effects ) the equations of motion for particles in an accelerator beam line are given by hamilton s equations @xcite , with an appropriate hamiltonian that describes the electromagnetic fields along the beam line . in a linear approximation",

    "physically , symplectic matrices preserve volumes in phase space ( this result is sometimes expressed as liouville s theorem @xcite ) .",
    "for example , for a linear transformation in one degree of freedom , a particular ellipse in @xmath7@xmath30 phase space will be transformed to an ellipse with ( in general ) a different shape ; but the area of the ellipse will remain the same .",
    "the number of invariants associated with a linear symplectic transformation is at least equal to the number of degrees of freedom in the system .",
    "thus , for motion in three degrees of freedom , there are at least three invariants . for particles in a beam in an accelerator beam line ,",
    "the invariants are associated with the emittances .",
    "if there is no coupling between the degrees of freedom ( so that motion in any direction @xmath7 , @xmath8 or @xmath14 is independent of the motion in the other two directions ) then we can associate an emittance with each of the three co - ordinates , i.e.  there is a horizontal emittance , a vertical emittance and a longitudinal emittance .",
    "we shall give a more formal definition of the emittances shortly .",
    "consider a particle moving through a periodic beam line , without coupling ( i.e.  a beam line with no skew quadrupoles or solenoids ) .",
    "after each periodic cell , we can plot the horizontal co - ordinate @xmath7 and momentum @xmath30 as a point in the horizontal phase space . after passing through many cells , observing the particle always at the corresponding locations in successive cells , and assuming that the motion of the particle is stable , we find that the points trace out an ellipse in phase space .",
    "the shape of the ellipse defines the _ courant  snyder parameters _ @xcite in the beam line at the observation point : see fig .",
    "[ figphasespaceellipse ] .",
    "the area of the ellipse is a measure of the amplitude of the oscillations .",
    "we define the _ horizontal action _",
    "@xmath31 of the particle such that the area of the ellipse is equal to @xmath32 .",
    "applying simple geometry to the phase space ellipse , we find that the action ( for uncoupled motion ) is related to the cartesian variables for the particle by : @xmath33 where the courant  snyder parameters satisfy the relation : @xmath34 we define the _ horizontal angle _ variable @xmath35 as follows : @xmath36 for a particle with a particular action ( i.e.  on an ellipse with a given area ) the angle variable specifies the position of the particle around the ellipse .",
    "the action - angle variables @xcite provide an alternative to the cartesian variables for describing the dynamics .",
    "although we have not shown that this is the case , the action - angle variables form a canonical conjugate pair : that is , the equations of motion expressed in terms of the action - angle variables can be derived from hamilton s equations , using an appropriate hamiltonian ( determined as before by the electromagnetic fields along the beam line ) .",
    "the advantage of using action - angle variables to describe particle motion in an accelerator is that , under symplectic transport ( i.e.  neglecting radiation and collective effects ) , the action of a particle is constant .",

    "can be generalised without too much difficulty to coupled motion ( see , for example @xcite ) , leading to _ normal mode emittances _ that are conserved under symplectic transport even where coupling is present .",
    "however , the expression for the emittance ( [ emittancerms ] ) is less easily generalised to include coupling , and an emittance that is defined by ( [ emittancerms ] ) will , in general , not be constant in a beam line where there is coupling .",
    "so far , we have considered only symplectic transport , i.e.  motion of a particle in drift spaces or in the electromagnetic fields of dipoles , quadrupoles , rf cavities etc .  without any radiation .",
    "however , we know that a charged particle moving through an electromagnetic field will ( in general ) undergo acceleration , and a charged particle undergoing acceleration will radiate energy in the form of electromagnetic waves .",
    "we now address the question of the impact that this radiation will have on the motion of a particle in a synchrotron storage ring .",
    "we shall consider first the case of uncoupled vertical motion : for a particle in a storage ring , this turns out to be the simplest case .",
    "since we are primarily interested in the dynamics of the particles generating the radiation , we quote a number of results regarding the properties of the radiation itself ( rather than derive these results from first principles ) .",
    "the first result that we quote for the properties of synchrotron radiation , is that radiation from a relativistic charged particle is emitted within a cone of opening angle of @xmath45 , where @xmath11 is the relativistic factor for the particle @xcite .",
    "the axis of the cone is tangent to the trajectory of the particle at the point where the radiation is emitted . for an ultra - relativistic particle , @xmath46 ,",
    "and we can assume that the radiation is emitted directly along the instantaneous direction of motion of the particle .",
    "consider a particle with initial momentum @xmath47 , that emits radiation carrying momentum @xmath48 .",
    "the momentum of the particle after emitting radiation is : @xmath49 since there is no change in direction of the particle , the vertical component of the momentum must scale in the same way as the total momentum of the particle : @xmath50 now we substitute this into the expression for the vertical betatron action ( valid for _ uncoupled _ motion ) : @xmath51 to find the change in the action resulting from the emission of radiation : @xmath52 note that in ( [ djy1 ] ) we neglect a term that is second order in @xmath53 .",
    "this term vanishes in the classical approximation when we consider the emission of an infinitesimal amount of radiation in an infinitesimal time interval @xmath54 ; however , we shall see later that including quantum effects , the second order term will lead to excitation of the action . retaining for the present only the first order term in @xmath53 , averaging ( [ djy1 ] ) over all particles in the beam gives : @xmath55 where we have used : @xmath56 and : @xmath57    the emittance is conserved under symplectic transport , so if the effects of radiation are ` slow ' ( i.e.  the rate of change of energy from radiation is small compared to the total energy of a particle divided by the revolution period ) , then for a particle in a storage ring we can average the momentum loss around the ring . from ( [ depsilonybydt ] ) : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the revolution period , and @xmath60 is the energy lost through synchrotron radiation in one turn .",
    "the approximation is valid for an ultra - relativistic particle , which has @xmath61 .",
    "the damping time @xmath62 is defined by : @xmath63 the evolution of the emittance is given by : @xmath64 typically , in an electron storage ring , the damping time is of order several tens of milliseconds , while the revolution period is of the order of a microsecond .",
    "in such a case , radiation effects are indeed slow compared to the revolution frequency .",
    "note that we made the assumption that the momentum of the particle was close to the reference momentum , i.e.  @xmath47 .",
    "if the particle continues to radiate without any restoration of energy , we will reach a point where this assumption is no longer valid .",
    "however , electron storage rings contain rf cavities to restore the energy lost through synchrotron radiation . for a thorough analysis of synchrotron radiation effects on the vertical motion ( at least , with a classical model for the radiation )",
    ", we should consider the change in momentum of a particle as it moves through an rf cavity .",
    "however , in general , rf cavities are designed to provide a longitudinal electric field .",
    "this means that particles experience a change in longitudinal momentum as they pass through a cavity , without any change in transverse momentum . in other words ,",
    "the vertical momentum @xmath65 of a particle will remain constant as the particle moves through an rf cavity , which will therefore have no effect on the emittance of the beam .    to complete our calculation of the vertical damping time , we need to find the energy lost by a particle through synchrotron radiation on each turn through the storage ring . at this point , we quote a second result from the theory of synchrotron radiation : the radiation power from a relativistic particle following a circular trajectory of radius @xmath1 is given by linard s formula @xcite : @xmath66 where the particle has charge @xmath5 , velocity @xmath67 , energy @xmath68 and momentum @xmath69 .",
    "the particle travels on a path with radius @xmath1 in a magnetic field of strength @xmath3 .",
    "the approximation in the final expression of ( [ synchrotronradiationpower ] ) is valid for ultra - relativistic particles , @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath70 is the permittivity of free space , and @xmath71 is a physical constant given by : @xmath72 for electrons , @xmath73 .",
    "note that the radiation power has a very strong scaling with the particle mass : the larger the mass of the particle , the smaller the amount of radiation emitted . in proton storage rings , except at extremely high energy , synchrotron",
    "radiation effects are generally negligible . for a particle with the reference energy , travelling close to the speed of light along the reference trajectory , we can find the energy loss by integrating the radiation power around the ring : @xmath74 using the expression ( [ synchrotronradiationpower ] ) for @xmath75 , we find : @xmath76 where @xmath1 is the radius of curvature of the particle trajectory , and we assume that the particle energy is equal to the reference energy @xmath77 . for convenience ,",
    "we assume that the closed orbit is the same as the reference trajectory for a particle with the reference momentum .",
    "following convention , we define the _ second synchrotron radiation integral _ , @xmath78 @xcite : @xmath79 in the ultra - relativistic limit , the energy loss per turn @xmath60 is written in terms of @xmath78 as : @xmath80 note that @xmath78 is a property of the lattice ( actually , a property of the reference trajectory ) , and does not depend on the properties of the beam .",
    "conventionally , there are five synchrotron radiation integrals used to express the effects of synchrotron radiation on the dynamics of ultra - relativistic particles in an accelerator .",
    "the first synchrotron radiation integral is not , however , directly related to the radiation effects .",
    "it is defined as : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the horizontal dispersion .",
    "@xmath83 is related to the _ momentum compaction factor _ @xmath84 , which plays an important role in the longitudinal dynamics , and describes the change in the length of the closed orbit with respect to particle energy : @xmath85 the length of the closed orbit changes with energy because of dispersion in regions where the reference trajectory has some curvature ( see fig .  [ figdispersivepathlength ] ) : @xmath86 if @xmath87 , then : @xmath88 the momentum compaction factor can be written : @xmath89     and follows a path parallel to the reference trajectory , then the length of the path followed by the particle is @xmath90 , where @xmath1 is the radius of curvature of the reference trajectory , and @xmath91 is the corresponding distance along the reference trajectory.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]      analysis of the effect of synchrotron radiation on the vertical emittance was relatively straightforward . when we consider the horizontal emittance , there are three complications that we need to address .",
    "first , the horizontal motion of a particle is often strongly coupled to the longitudinal motion .",
    "we can not treat the horizontal motion without also considering ( to some extent ) the longitudinal motion .",
    "second , where the reference trajectory is curved ( usually , in dipoles ) , the length of the path taken by a particle depends on the horizontal co - ordinate with respect to the reference trajectory .",
    "this can be a significant effect since dipoles inevitably generate dispersion ( a variation of the orbit with respect to changes in particle energy ) , so the length of the path taken by a particle through a dipole will depend on its energy . finally , dipole magnets are sometimes built with a gradient , in which case the vertical field seen by a particle in a dipole will depend on the horizontal co - ordinate of the particle .",
    "coupling between transverse and longitudinal planes in a beam line is usually represented by the dispersion , @xmath82 and @xmath92 , defined by : @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the co - ordinate and momentum for a particle with energy deviation @xmath19 on a closed orbit .",
    "we use the horizontal action - angle variables @xmath31 and @xmath35 to describe the horizontal betatron oscillations of a particle with respect to the dispersive closed orbit , i.e.  the closed orbit for a particle with energy deviation @xmath19 . in terms of the horizontal dispersion and betatron action ,",
    "the horizontal co - ordinate and momentum of a particle are given by : @xmath96 when a particle emits radiation , we have to take into account both the change in momentum of the particle , and the change in co - ordinate and momentum with respect to the new ( dispersive ) closed orbit .",
    "note that when we analysed the vertical motion , we assumed that there was no vertical dispersion .",
    "this is the case in an ideal , planar storage ring , but as we shall discuss later , alignment errors on the magnets can lead to the generation of some vertical dispersion that depends on the errors , the effects of which can not always be neglected .    taking all the above effects into account for the horizontal motion , we can proceed along the same lines as for the analysis of the vertical emittance .",
    "that is , we first write down the changes in co - ordinate @xmath7 and momentum @xmath30 resulting from an emission of radiation with momentum @xmath48 ( taking into account the additional effects of dispersion ) .",
    "then , we substitute expressions for the new co - ordinate and momentum into the expression for the horizontal betatron action , to find the change in action resulting from the radiation emission . averaging over all particles in the beam",
    "gives the change in the emittance that results from radiation emission from each particle in the beam .",
    "finally , we integrate around the ring ( taking account of changes in path length and field strength with the horizontal position in the bends ) to find the change in emittance over one turn .    filling in the steps in this calculation ,",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "first , we note that , in the presence of dispersion , the action @xmath31 is written : @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the horizontal co - ordinate and momentum with respect to the dispersive closed orbit : @xmath100 after emission of radiation carrying momentum @xmath48 , the variables change by : @xmath101 we write the resulting change in the action as :",
    "@xmath102 the change in the horizontal action is : @xmath103 where , in the limit @xmath104 : @xmath105 and : @xmath106 treating radiation as a classical phenomenon , we can take the limit @xmath107 in the limit of small time interval , @xmath108 . in this approximation , the term that is second order in @xmath48 vanishes ,",
    "and we can write for the rate of change of the action : @xmath109 where @xmath75 is the _ rate of energy loss _ of the particle through synchrotron radiation ( [ synchrotronradiationpower ] ) . to find the _ average _ rate of change of horizontal action , we integrate over one revolution period :",
    "@xmath110 it is more convenient , given a particular lattice design , to integrate over the circumference of the ring , rather than over one revolution period .",
    "however , we have to be careful changing the variable of integration ( from time @xmath18 to distance @xmath0 ) where the reference trajectory is curved : @xmath111 so : @xmath112 where the rate of energy loss @xmath75 is given by ( [ synchrotronradiationpower ] )",
    ".    we have to take into account the fact that in general , the field strength in a dipole can vary with position .",
    "to first order in @xmath7 we can write : @xmath113 substituting ( [ gradientdipole ] ) into ( [ synchrotronradiationpower ] ) , and with the use of ( [ w1 ] ) , we find ( after some algebra ) that , averaging over all particles in the beam : @xmath114 where the energy loss per turn @xmath60 is given by ( [ energylossperturn ] ) , the second synchrotron radiation integral @xmath78 is given by ( [ eqn_i2 ] ) , and the fourth synchrotron radiation integral is @xmath115 : @xmath116 @xmath117 is the normalised quadrupole gradient in the dipole field : @xmath118 note that in ( [ eqn_i4 ] ) , the dispersion and quadrupole gradient contribute to the integral only in the dipoles : in other parts of the ring , where the beam follows a straight path , the curvature @xmath119 is zero .",
    "averaging ( [ djxdt ] ) over all particles in the beam and combining with ( [ a7 ] ) we have : @xmath120 defining the horizontal damping time @xmath121 : @xmath122 where : @xmath123 the evolution of the horizontal emittance can be written : @xmath124 the quantity @xmath125 is called the _ horizontal damping partition number_. for most synchrotron storage ring lattices , if there is no gradient in the dipoles then @xmath125 is very close to 1 . from ( [ horizontalemittanceevolution1 ] )",
    "the horizontal emittance decays exponentially : @xmath126      so far we have considered only the effects of synchrotron radiation on the transverse motion , but there are also effects on the longitudinal motion .",
    "generally , synchrotron oscillations are treated differently from betatron oscillations because in one revolution of a typical storage ring , particles complete many betatron oscillations but only a fraction of a synchrotron oscillation . in other words ,",
    "the betatron tunes are @xmath127 , but the synchrotron tune is @xmath128 . to find the effects of radiation on synchrotron motion , we proceed as follows .",
    "we first write down the equations of motion ( for the dynamical variables @xmath14 and @xmath19 ) for a particle performing synchrotron motion , including the radiation energy loss . then , we express the energy loss per turn as a function of the energy deviation of the particle .",
    "this introduces a damping term into the equations of motion .",
    "finally , solving the equations of motion gives synchrotron oscillations ( as expected ) with amplitude that decays exponentially .",
    "the changes in energy deviation @xmath19 and longitudinal co - ordinate @xmath14 for a particle in one turn around a storage ring are given by : @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the rf voltage , @xmath131 the rf frequency , @xmath77 is the reference energy of the beam , @xmath132 is the nominal rf phase , and @xmath133 ( which may be different from @xmath60 ) is the energy lost by the particle through synchrotron radiation . strictly speaking ,",
    "since the longitudinal co - ordinate @xmath14 is a measure of the _ time _ at which a particle arrives at a particular location in the ring , changes in @xmath14 with respect to energy should be written in terms of the _ phase slip factor _",
    "@xmath134 , which describes the change in revolution period with respect to changes in energy , rather than in terms of the momentum compaction factor @xmath84 .",

    "as we shall see , this induces some ` noise ' on the beam , known as _ quantum excitation _ , the effect of which is to increase the emittance .",
    "the beam in an electron ( or positron ) storage ring will eventually reach an equilibrium distribution determined by a balance between the radiation damping and the quantum excitation . in the remainder of this section , we shall derive expressions for the rate of quantum excitation and for the equilibrium emittances in an electron storage ring .",

    "lattices rarely , if ever , achieve the ideal conditions .",
    "in particular , the beta function in an achromat is usually not optimal for low emittance ; and it is difficult to tune the dispersion for the ideal tme conditions .",
    "the main reasons for this are : first , beam dynamics issues ( relating , for example , to nonlinear dynamics and collective effects ) often impose a variety of strong constraints on the design ; and second , optimising the lattice functions while respecting all the various constraints can require complex configurations of quadrupoles .",
    "a particularly challenging constraint on design of a low - emittance lattice is the dynamic aperture .",
    "storage rings require a large dynamic aperture in order to achieve good injection efficiency and good beam lifetime .",
    "however , low emittance lattices generally need low dispersion and beta functions , and hence require strong quadrupoles . as a result ,",
    "the chromaticity can be large , and must be corrected using strong sextupoles .",
    "strong sextupoles lead to highly nonlinear motion and a limited dynamic aperture : the trajectories of particles at even quite modest betatron amplitudes or energy deviations can become unstable , resulting in short beam lifetime .",
    "lattices composed of dba cells have been a popular choice for third generation synchrotron light sources .",
    "the dba structure provides a lower natural emittance than a fodo lattice with the same number of dipoles , while the long , dispersion - free straight sections provide ideal locations for insertion devices such as undulators and wigglers . if an insertion device , such as an undulator or wiggler , is incorporated in a storage ring at a location with large dispersion , then the dipole fields in the device can make a significant contribution to the quantum excitation ( @xmath197 ) . as a result",
    ", the insertion device can lead to an increase in the natural emittance of the storage ring . by using a dba lattice ,",
    "dispersion - free straights are naturally provided , in which undulators and wigglers can be located without blowing up the natural emittance . however , there is some tolerance . in many cases ,",
    "it is possible to detune the lattice from the strict dba conditions , thereby allowing some reduction in natural emittance at the cost of some dispersion in the straights .",
    "the insertion devices will then contribute to the quantum excitation ; but depending on the lattice and the insertion devices , there may still be a net benefit . some light sources that were originally designed with zero - dispersion straights take advantage of tuning flexibility to operate with non - zero dispersion in the straights ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "this provides a lower natural emittance , and better output for users .",
    "there are of course many options for the design of a storage ring lattice , beyond the fodo , dba and tme cells we have discussed so far . for example , it is possible to combine the dba and tme lattices , constructing an arc cell consisting of more than two dipoles .",
    "the dipoles at either end of the cell have zero dispersion ( and gradient of the dispersion ) at their outside faces , thus satisfying the achromat condition .",
    "since the lattice functions are different in the central dipoles compared to the end dipoles , we have additional degrees of freedom we can use to minimise the quantum excitation .",
    "the result is a _ multi - bend achromat _ ( mba ) that combines the benefits of a dba lattice ( with long straights providing good locations for insertion devices ) and a tme lattice ( providing the possibility of achieving lower emittance than in a dba ) .    in a mba , it is possible to have cases where the end dipoles and central dipoles differ in the bend angle ( i.e.  length of dipole ) , and/or the bend radius ( i.e.  strength of dipole ) . for simplicity ,",
    "let us consider the case where the dipoles all have the same bending radius ( i.e.  they all have the same field strength ) , but they vary in length .",
    "assume that each arc cell has a fixed number @xmath304 of dipoles , with average bending angle @xmath305 . if the two outer dipoles have bending angle @xmath306 and the inner dipoles have bending angle @xmath307 , then the coefficients @xmath308 and @xmath309 satisfy : @xmath310 let us assume that the lattice functions ( courant  snyder parameters and dispersion ) in the outer dipoles are the same as in a dba lattice , and in the inner dipoles are the same as in a tme lattice",

    "as long as the dispersion in the straights is not too large , there is a net benefit , despite some contribution to the emittance from quantum excitation in the insertion devices .    as a final remark",
    ", we note that further flexibility to optimise the natural emittance can be provided by relaxing the constraint that the field strength in a dipole is constant along the length of the dipole .",

    "recall that the natural ( horizontal ) emittance in a storage ring is given by ( [ naturalemittance1 ] ) : @xmath322 if the horizontal and vertical motion are independent of each other ( i.e.  if there is no betatron coupling ) then we can apply the same analysis to the vertical motion as we did to the horizontal .",
    "if we build a ring that is completely flat ( i.e.  no vertical bending ) , then there is no vertical dispersion , i.e.  @xmath323 at all locations around the ring .",
    "it follows that the vertical @xmath199 function @xmath324 : @xmath325 also vanishes around the entire ring , and that therefore the synchrotron radiation integral @xmath326 will be zero .",
    "this implies that the vertical emittance will damp to zero .",
    "however , in deriving equation ( [ naturalemittance ] ) for the natural emittance , we assumed that all photons were emitted directly along the instantaneous direction of motion of the electron .",
    "in fact , photons are emitted with a distribution having angular width @xmath45 about the direction of motion of the electron .",
    "this leads to some vertical ` recoil ' that excites vertical betatron motion , resulting in a non - zero vertical emittance .",
    "a detailed analysis leads to the following formula for the fundamental lower limit on the vertical emittance @xcite : @xmath327 to estimate a typical value for the lower limit on the vertical emittance , let us write equation ( [ verticalemittancelowerlimit ] ) in the approximate form : @xmath328 where @xmath329 is the average vertical beta function around the ring . using some typical values ( @xmath330 m , @xmath331 , @xmath166 , @xmath332 , @xmath333 )",
    ", we find : @xmath334 the lowest vertical emittance achieved so far in a storage ring is around a picometer , several times larger than the fundamental lower limit ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in practice ,",
    "vertical emittance in a ( nominally planar ) storage ring is dominated by two effects : residual vertical dispersion , which couples longitudinal and vertical motion ; and betatron coupling , which couples horizontal and vertical motion .",
    "the dominant causes of residual vertical dispersion and betatron coupling are magnet alignment errors , in particular : tilts of the dipoles around the beam axis ; vertical alignment errors on the quadrupoles ; tilts of the quadrupoles around the beam axis ; and vertical alignment errors of the sextupoles .",
    "let us consider these errors in a little more detail .",
    "steering errors lead to a distortion of the closed orbit , which generates vertical dispersion and ( through vertical offsets of the beam in the sextupoles ) betatron coupling .",
    "a vertical steering error may be generated by rotation of a dipole , so that the field is not exactly vertical , or by vertical misalignment of a quadrupole , so that there is a horizontal magnetic field at the location of the reference trajectory .",
    "coupling errors lead to a transfer of horizontal betatron motion and dispersion into the vertical plane : in both cases , the result is an increase in vertical emittance .",
    "coupling may result from rotation of a quadrupole , so that the field contains a skew component .",
    "when particles pass through a skew quadrupole , they receive a vertical kick that depends on their horizontal offset . as a result , quantum excitation of the horizontal emittance feeds into the vertical plane .    a vertical beam offset in a sextupole",
    "has the same effect as a skew quadrupole . to understand this ,",
    "recall that a sextupole field is given by : @xmath335 a vertical offset can be represented by the transformation @xmath336 : @xmath337 the terms in ( [ offsetsextupolebx ] ) and ( [ offsetsextupoleby ] ) that are first order in @xmath338 constitute a skew quadrupole of strength @xmath339 .",
    "when designing and building a storage ring , we need to know how accurately the magnets must be aligned , to keep the vertical emittance below some specified limit .",
    "although beam - based tuning methods also normally have to be applied , the ultimate emittance achieved after machine tuning does depend on the accuracy with which the initial alignment is performed .",
    "it is therefore useful to have expressions that relate the closed orbit distortion , vertical dispersion , betatron coupling and ( ultimately ) the vertical emittance , to the alignment errors on the magnets .",
    "let us begin by considering the closed orbit distortion .",
    "in terms of the action - angle variables , we can write the coordinate and momentum of a particle at any point : @xmath340 suppose there is a steering error at some location @xmath341 which leads to an instantaneous change ( i.e.  a ` kick ' ) @xmath342 in the vertical momentum .",
    "after one complete turn of the storage ring , starting from immediately after @xmath256 , the trajectory of a particle will close on itself if : @xmath343 where @xmath344 , and @xmath345 is the vertical tune ( see fig .",

    ", we can write the coordinate for the closed orbit at any point in the ring : @xmath347 where @xmath348 is the phase advance from @xmath256 to @xmath0 .    , then after nearly one complete turn , just before the dipole kick the co - ordinate and momentum of the particle are @xmath349 .",
    "the dipole kick then puts the particle back onto the closed orbit.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]      it is often helpful to be able to estimate the size of the closed orbit distortion that may be expected from random quadrupole misalignments of a given magnitude .",
    "we can derive an expression for this from equation ( [ closedorbitequation ] ) .",
    "for a quadrupole of integrated focusing strength @xmath351 , vertically misaligned from the reference trajectory by @xmath352 , the steering is : @xmath353 squaring equation ( [ closedorbitequation ] ) , then averaging over many seeds of random alignment errors , we find : @xmath354 in performing the average , we assume that the alignments of different quadrupoles are not correlated in any way .",
    "the ratio between the closed orbit rms and the magnet misalignment rms is sometimes known as the _ orbit amplification factor_. values for the orbit amplification factor are typically in the range from 10 to about 100 .",
    "of course , the amplification factor is a statistical quantity : the actual rms of the orbit distortion depends on the particular set of alignment errors present .      in the context of low - emittance storage rings ,",
    "vertical closed orbit errors are of concern for two reasons .",
    "first , vertical steering generates vertical dispersion , which is a source of vertical emittance .",
    "second , vertical orbit errors contribute to vertical beam offset in the sextupoles , which effectively generates skew quadrupole fields , which in turn lead to betatron coupling .",
    "we have seen how to analyse the beam dynamics to understand the closed orbit distortion that arises from quadrupole alignment errors of a given magnitude .",
    "our goal is to relate quantities such as orbit distortion , vertical dispersion , coupling , and vertical emittance , to the alignment errors on the magnets .",
    "we continue with betatron coupling .",
    "betatron coupling describes the effects that can arise when the vertical motion of a particle depends on its horizontal motion , and vice - versa .",
    "betatron coupling can arise ( for example ) from skew quadrupoles and solenoids .    in a storage ring ,",
    "skew quadrupole fields ofen arise from quadrupole tilts , and from vertical alignment errors on sextupoles .",
    "a full treatment of betatron coupling can become quite complex , and there are many different formalisms that can be used . however , it is possible to use a simplified model to derive approximate expressions the equilibrium emittances in the presence of coupling .",
    "the procedure is as follows .",
    "first , we write down the equations of motion for a single particle in a beamline containing coupling .",
    "then , we look for a ` steady state ' solution to the equations of motion , in which the horizontal and vertical actions are each constants of the motion .",
    "finally , we assume that the actions in the steady state solution correspond to the equilibrium emittances ( since @xmath355 ) , and that the sum of the horizontal and vertical emittances is equal to the natural emittance of the ` ideal ' lattice ( i.e.  the natural emittance of the lattice in the absence of errors ) .",
    "this procedure can give some useful results , but because of the approximations involved , the formulae are not always very accurate .",
    "we will use hamiltonian mechanics . in this formalism , the equations of motion for the action - angle variables ( with path length @xmath0 as the independent variable ) are derived from the hamiltonian : @xmath356 using hamilton s equations : @xmath357 for a particle moving along a linear , uncoupled beamline , the hamiltonian is : @xmath358    the first step is to derive an appropriate form for the hamiltonian in a storage ring with skew quadrupole perturbations . in cartesian variables , the equations of motion in a skew quadrupole",
    "can be written : @xmath359 where : @xmath360 these equations can be derived from the hamiltonian : @xmath361    we are interested in the case where there are skew quadrupoles distributed around a storage ring .",
    "the ` focusing ' effect of a skew quadrupole is represented by a term in the hamiltonian : @xmath362 this implies that the hamiltonian for a beam line with distributed skew quadrupoles can be written : @xmath363 the beta functions and the skew quadrupole strength are functions of the position @xmath0 .",
    "this makes it difficult to solve the equations of motion exactly .",
    "therefore , we simplify the problem by ` averaging ' the hamiltonian : @xmath364 here , @xmath365 , @xmath366 are the phase advances per unit length of the beam line , given by : @xmath367 where @xmath368 is the circumference of the ring .",
    "@xmath369 is a constant that characterises the coupling strength . for reasons that will become clear shortly ,",
    "we re - write the coupling term , to put the hamiltonian in the form : @xmath370 the constants @xmath371 represent the skew quadrupole strength averaged around the ring . however , we need to take into account that the kick from a skew quadrupole depends on the betatron phase .",
    "thus , we write : @xmath372 where @xmath245 and @xmath373 are the betatron phase advances from the start of the ring .",
    "now suppose that @xmath374 .",
    "( this can occur , for example , if @xmath375 , in which case all the contributions to @xmath376 from the skew quadrupole perturbations will add together in phase . )",
    "then , we can simplify things further by dropping the term in @xmath377 from the hamiltonian : @xmath378 we can now write down the equations of motion : @xmath379    even after all the simplifications we have made , the equations of motion are still rather difficult to solve .",
    "fortunately , however , we do not require the general solution .",
    "in fact , we are only interested in the properties of some special cases .",
    "first of all , we note that from ( [ coupledeom1 ] ) and ( [ coupledeom2 ] ) : @xmath380 and therefore the sum of the actions @xmath381 is constant .",
    "going further , we notice that if @xmath382 , then the rate of change of each action falls to zero .",

    "we expect the betatron actions of the particles to change only slowly , i.e.  on the timescale of the radiation damping , which is much longer than the timescale of the betatron motion . in that case",

    "the procedure is simple : a quadrupole ( or combination of quadrupoles ) is used to change the tunes , and then the tunes are recorded and plotted as a function of quadrupole strength .",
    "the minimum separation between the measured tunes gives the coupling strength .",

    "now we look for a transformation , represented by a @xmath438 matrix @xmath444 , that puts @xmath439 into block - diagonal form , i.e.  that ` decouples ' the transverse motion : @xmath445 @xmath446 and @xmath447 are @xmath442 matrices describing betatron motion in a coordinate system in which the motion appears uncoupled .",
    "there are various recipes for constructing the decoupling transformation @xmath444 ( which is not unique ) : see , for example @xcite .",
    "having obtained the matrices describing the uncoupled motion , we can derive the courant  snyder parameters for the normal mode motion in the usual way .",
    "for example , we can write : @xmath448 and similarly for mode i. we can also obtain the normal mode dispersion functions , by applying the transformation @xmath444 to a vector constructed from the dispersion functions in the original cartesian co - ordinates .",
    "then , we can construct the @xmath199 function for each mode ; for example : @xmath449 finally , we can write for the _ mode ii emittance _ : @xmath450 and similarly for mode i.    for many storage rings , equation ( [ modeiiemittance ] ) works well , and gives an accurate result .",
    "however , if there is strong coupling between the transverse and the longitudinal motion ( which can happen , for example , for large values of the synchrotron tune ) , then the approximations needed to derive equation ( [ modeiiemittance ] ) start to break down .    as an alternative to the normal mode analysis",
    ", we can consider chao s method @xcite for computing the emittances , which provides a formula that can be expressed in a convenient form , though it is not always easy to apply .",
    "it is again based on the single - turn transfer matrix , but it is more accurate than the ` decoupling ' method , since it uses the full @xmath451 transfer matrix , and does not assume weak coupling between the longitudinal and transverse motion .",
    "we do not explain here the physics behind the formula , but simply quote the result : @xmath452 where @xmath453  i , ii , iii is an index that specifies a particular degree of freedom , the eigenvalues of the single - turn matrix _ including radiation damping _",
    "are @xmath454 , @xmath455 is the fifth component of the @xmath456 eigenvector of the _ symplectic _ single - turn matrix , and : @xmath457 where @xmath458 is the classical radius and @xmath10 the mass of the particles in the beam .    finally , we mention the envelope method @xcite . like",
    "chao s method , it gives accurate results for the emittances even if there is strong coupling between all three degrees of freedom .",
    "the envelope method is based on finding the equilibrium beam distribution described by the _ sigma matrix _ :",
    "@xmath459 this is a symmetric matrix , constructed from the second order moments of all possible combinations of the dynamical variables . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume in what follows that the first order moments are all zero , i.e.  that the closed orbit lies along the reference trajectory . however , the method is easily generalised to include cases where there is closed orbit distortion . in the absence of coupling , the sigma matrix will be block diagonal .",
    "we are interested in the more general case , where coupling is present .    under a single turn around an accelerator",
    ", @xmath460 transforms as : @xmath461 where @xmath25 is the single - turn transfer matrix ( including radiation damping ) and @xmath462 is a constant matrix representing the effects of quantum excitation . from knowledge of the properties of synchrotron radiation",
    ", we can compute the matrices @xmath25 and @xmath462 for a given lattice design : this will be discussed further below , where we shall give explicit expressions for the transfer matrices in a dipole , including radiation effects .",
    "the _ equilibrium _ distribution @xmath463 has the property : @xmath464 for given @xmath25 and @xmath462 , we can solve equation ( [ equilibriumdistributioncondition ] ) to find @xmath463 , and then from @xmath463 we can find the _ invariant _",
    "emittances , i.e.  the conserved quantities under symplectic transport . for any beam distribution @xmath460 , the invariant emittances @xmath465 are given by : @xmath466 where @xmath28 is the antisymmetric block - diagonal matrix ( [ antisymmetricmatrixs ] ) .",
    "to see that this is the case , consider the ( simpler ) case of motion in one degree of freedom .",
    "the sigma matrix in this case is : @xmath467 in one degree of freedom , the matrix corresponding to ( [ antisymmetricmatrixs ] ) is : @xmath468 then , the eigenvalues of @xmath469 are @xmath470 .",
    "now , we can show that ( under certain assumptions ) the emittance is conserved as a bunch is transported along a beam line . in any number of degrees of freedom , the linear transformation in phase space co - ordinates of a particle in the bunch between two points in the beam line can be represented by a matrix @xmath25 : @xmath471 where @xmath472 is a vector whose components are the phase space variables @xmath473 .",
    "now consider how the sigma matrix transforms .",
    "the sigma matrix can be written as the product of the phase - space co - ordinates averaged over the bunch : @xmath474 where @xmath475 is the @xmath476 component of the sigma matrix , and the @xmath473 are the dynamical variables .",
    "the brackets @xmath477 indicate an average over all particles in the bunch . then , using ( [ transfermatrix1 ] ) , it follows that under a transformation @xmath25 of the dynamical variables , the sigma matrix transforms as : @xmath478 since @xmath28 is a constant matrix , it immediately follows that : @xmath479 then , using the fact that @xmath25 is symplectic ( [ symplecticcondition ] ) , we have : @xmath480 this is a similarity transformation of @xmath469 : the eigenvalues of any matrix are conserved under a similarity transformation . therefore , since the eigenvalues of @xmath469 give the emittance of the bunch , it follows that the emittances are conserved under linear , symplectic transport .",
    "this argument applies for any number of degrees of freedom .",
    "we define the matrix @xmath28 in three degrees of freedom by ( [ antisymmetricmatrixs ] ) .",
    "the six eigenvalues of @xmath469 are then @xmath481 , where @xmath482 is an index ranging over the different degrees of freedom .",
    "the quantities @xmath465 are all conserved under linear , symplectic transport . even if , as is generally the case , the sigma matrix is not block - diagonal ( i.e.  if there is coupling present ) , then we can still find three invariant emittances using this method , without any modification .",
    "neglecting radiaton , if @xmath25 is a ( symplectic ) matrix that represents the linear single - turn transformation at some point in a storage ring , then an invariant or ` matched ' distribution is one that satisfies : @xmath483 in general , all the particles in the bunch change position in phase space after one turn around the ring : but for a matched distribution , the second order moments remain the same .",
    "although this condition determines the lattice functions ( which can be found from the _ eigenvectors _ of @xmath469 ) , it is not sufficient to determine the emittances . in other words",
    ", the matched distribution condition determines the _ shape _ of the bunch , but not the _ size _ of the bunch .",
    "this makes sense : after all , in a proton storage ring , we can have a matched bunch of any emittance .",
    "however , in an electron storage ring , we know that radiation effects will damp the emittances to some equilibrium values .",
    "we shall now show how to apply the concept of a matched distribution , when radiation effects are included , to find the equilibrium emittances in an electron storage ring .    to account for radiation effects in an electron storage ring ,",
    "we must make two modifications to the single - turn transformation .",
    "first , the matrix @xmath25 will no longer be symplectic : this accounts for radiation damping .",
    "second , as well as first order terms in the transformation ( represented by the matrix @xmath25 ) , there will be zeroth order terms : these will correspond to the quantum excitation .",
    "the condition for a matched distribution should then be written : @xmath484 where @xmath25 and @xmath462 are constant , non - symplectic matrices that represent the first order and zeroth order terms in the single - turn transformation , respectively .",
    "equation ( [ singleturndampingexcitation ] ) is sufficient to determine the sigma matrix uniquely  in other words , using just this equation ( with known @xmath25 and @xmath462 ) we can find the bunch emittances and the matched lattice functions .",
    "the envelope method for finding the equilibrium emittances in a storage ring then consists of three steps .",
    "first , we need to find the first order terms @xmath25 and zeroth order terms @xmath462 in the single - turn transformation : @xmath485 in the second step , we use the matching condition ( [ singleturndampingexcitation ] ) to determine the sigma matrix .",
    "then , in the third and final step , we find the equilibrium emittances from the eigenvalues of @xmath469 .    strictly speaking , since @xmath25 is not symplectic , the emittances are not invariant as the bunch moves around the ring .",
    "therefore , we may expect to find a different emittance at each point around the ring .",
    "however , if radiation effects are fairly small , then the variations in the emittances will also be small .",
    "the transfer matrices @xmath25 and @xmath462 for an entire ring can be constructed from the transfer matrices for individual components in the ring . as an example",
    ", we shall consider a thin ` slice ' of a dipole .",
    "this is an important case , since in most storage rings , radiation effects are significant only in dipoles . furthermore , complete dipoles can be constructed by composing the maps for a number of slices .",
    "hence , once we have a map for a thin slice of dipole , and knowing the usual ( symplectic ) transfer maps for drift spaces , quadrupoles and rf cavities , we will be able to construct the map for one complete turn of a storage ring , starting at any point .",
    "recall that the transformations for the phase space variables in the emission of radiation carrying momentum @xmath48 are : @xmath486 where @xmath4 is the reference momentum . in general",
    ", @xmath48 is a function of the co - ordinates . to find the transformation matrices @xmath25 and @xmath462",
    ", we find an explicit expression for @xmath53 , and then write down the above transformations to first order . for an ultra - relativistic particle , the momentum lost through radiation can be expressed in terms of the synchrotron radiation power @xmath75 ( energy loss per unit time ) : @xmath487 where @xmath1 is the radius of curvature of the reference trajectory .",
    "the radiation power @xmath75 is given by ( [ synchrotronradiationpower ] ) .",
    "in general , the dipole may have a quadrupole gradient , so the field is : @xmath488 also , the particle may have some energy deviation , so the total energy is : @xmath489 substituting these expressions , we find ( after some manipulation ) : @xmath490 where @xmath117 is the normalised quadrupole gradient in the dipole : @xmath491 hence , the normalised momentum loss may be written : @xmath492 expanding to first order in the phase space variables , we can write : @xmath493    given the expression ( [ dpbyp0 ] ) for @xmath53 , the transformations ( [ radiationcoordinatetransformation1])([radiationcoordinatetransformation6 ] ) become ( to first order in the dynamical variables ) : @xmath494 the first order terms give the components of @xmath495 , the transfer matrix for a thin slice ( length @xmath91 ) of a dipole .",
    "there is a zeroth order term in the map for the dynamical variables that will contribute to ( the ( 6,6 ) component of ) @xmath496 , which contains the zeroth order terms in the transformation of the sigma matrix through a thin slice of a dipole . since the ( 6,6 )",
    "component of @xmath496 represents the quantity @xmath497 , the contribution to this component from the zeroth order term in ( [ radiationcoordinatetransformation6a ] ) will be second order in @xmath91 .",
    "we still have to take proper account of the quantum nature of the radiation .",
    "this will make an additional contribution to @xmath496 .",
    "the zeroth order term in the map for the sigma matrix is given by : @xmath498_{66 } = \\left\\langle \\left ( \\frac{dp}{p_0 } \\right)^{\\!\\!2 } \\right\\rangle \\approx \\frac{\\langle u^2 \\rangle}{e_0 ^ 2},\\ ] ] where @xmath499 is the mean square of the photon energy .",
    "using ( [ integralndotusquared ] ) , we find that , to zeroth order in the phase space variables : @xmath500 note that this term is first order in @xmath91 , whereas the contribution to @xmath496 that we found previously was second order in @xmath91 .",
    "hence , in the limit @xmath501 , the latter contribution dominates over the previous contribution .    collecting the above results , and taking only dominant contributions in the limit @xmath501 , we find that the radiation in a thin slice of dipole has an effect on the sigma matrix that can be represented by : @xmath502 where : @xmath503 and : @xmath504    to construct the full single - turn transformation , we need to compose the maps for all the elements in the ring , including the radiation effects in the dipoles .",
    "it is straightforward to do this numerically using a computer .",
    "however , some care is needed in handling the @xmath462 matrices .",
    "for example , given the sigma matrix at a location @xmath256 , we find the sigma matrix at a location @xmath505 from : @xmath506 then the sigma matrix at @xmath507 is given by : @xmath508 hence : @xmath509 continuing the process , we find : @xmath510 when composing the transfer maps for thin slices of a dipole , we have to remember to ` interleave ' the radiation maps with the usual symplectic transport map for a thin slice of dipole .",
    "the next step in finding the equilibrium emittances is to solve the matching condition ( [ singleturndampingexcitation ] ) to find the sigma matrix for the equilibrium distribution . to do this ( for given matrices @xmath25 and @xmath462 ) , we make use of the eigenvectors @xmath133 of @xmath25 , and the diagonal matrix @xmath511 constructed from the eigenvalues of @xmath25 : @xmath512 defining @xmath513 and @xmath514 by : @xmath515 the solution for the sigma matrix can be written : @xmath516 the above formulae enable us to find the matched ( equilibrium ) distribution @xmath460 ; the eigenvalues of @xmath469 are then @xmath481 , where @xmath465 are the emittances .",
    "the envelope method makes explicit the fact that vertical emittance is generated by coupling between the vertical and longitudinal planes in regions where radiation is emitted ( i.e.  by vertical dispersion in dipoles ) , and by coupling between the vertical and horizontal planes in regions where radiation is emitted ( i.e.  by betatron coupling in dipoles ) . here",
    ", we need to be careful in the use of the term ` coupling ' . in this context",
    ", coupling means the presence of non - zero components off the block - diagonals in the single - turn matrix , @xmath25 .",
    "full characterisation of the coupling requires complete specification of all the components off the block - diagonals in @xmath25 . depending on these components , it is possible to have coupling in a storage ring , and not generate any vertical emittance .",
    "for example , one could construct a closed ` coupling bump ' using sets of skew quadrupoles in a straight section in a storage ring . with proper care in the design , outside the region between the skew quadrupoles ,",
    "the vertical motion can be completely decoupled from the horizontal and the longitudinal . then , despite the presence of strong coupling in some parts of the storage ring , the equilibrium vertical emittance will come only from the opening angle of the cone describing the spatial distribution of the synchrotron radiation .",
    "numerical computational procedures ( such as the envelope method ) for finding the equilibrium beam distribution in a storage ring are important because they provide ways to calculate the equilibrium emittances in complex , coupled lattices .",
    "it is possible to include other non - symplectic effects in the calculation ( such as , for example , intrabeam scattering ) .",
    "often , coupling comes from magnet alignment errors , which will not be known completely in an operating machine . at the design stage , it is important to characterise the sensitivity of a lattice to magnet alignment errors , particularly regarding the vertical emittance .",
    "being able to compute the beam emittances in a storage ring with coupling errors present makes it possible to simulate the effects of various types and sizes of alignment error  and then to optimise the lattice design to minimise the sensitivity to the likely errors .",
    "however , in practice , tuning a storage ring to achieve a vertical emittance of no more than a few picometres ( which may be required for some applications ) is a considerable challenge , even in a lattice designed so as to minimise the sensitivity to coupling errors .",
    "accurate alignment ( by survey ) of the magnets is always the first step in achieving ultra - low emittances ; but beam - based tuning methods will then also be needed .          1 .",
    "align the magnets by a survey of the ring .",
    "typically , quadrupoles need to be aligned to better than a few tens of microns , and sextupoles to better than a couple of hundred microns . 2 .",
    "determine the positions of the bpms relative to the quadrupoles .",
    "this is known as ` beam - based alignment ' ( bba , see fig .",
    "[ figbeambasedalignment ] ) , and can be achieved by steering the beam to a position in each quadrupole where changing the quadrupole strength has no effect on the orbit @xcite .",
    "3 .   correct the orbit ( using steering magnets ) so that it is as close as possible to the centres of the quadrupoles .",
    "4 .   correct the vertical dispersion ( using steering magnets and/or skew quadrupoles , and measuring the dispersion at the bpms ) as close to zero as possible .",
    "correct the coupling , by adjusting skew quadrupoles so that an orbit ` kick ' in one plane ( from any orbit corrector ) has no effect on the orbit in the other plane .",
    "results from the tuning procedure described above can be limited by systematic errors on the bpms , which can affect dispersion and coupling measurements .",
    "a useful technique for overcoming such limitations is to apply orbit response matrix ( orm ) analysis @xcite .",
    "this can be used to determine a wide range of magnet and diagnostics parameters , including coupling errors and bpm tilts .",
    "although vertical emittances of order 1 pm have now been achieved ( representing an emittance ratio of less than 0.1% ) , tuning an electron storage ring to operate in this regime still remains a challenging goal , requiring extensive work and application of a range of techniques to reduce errors . even making measurements of emittances less than a few picometres is not straightfoward , and requires specialist instrumentation ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
