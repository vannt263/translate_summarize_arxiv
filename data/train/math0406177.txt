    "a link @xmath0 in a homology @xmath1-sphere is called a _ graph link _ if its exterior is a graph manifold .",
    "for example , a link in @xmath2 is a graph link if and only if it is _ solvable _ , that is , if it can be constructed by iterated cabling and connected sum operations from the unknot .",
    "this class of links is particularly interesting , since all the links that arise in complex algebraic geometry are of this type .",
    "eisenbud and neumann @xcite gave a classification of graph links by means of decorated trees called _",
    "splice diagrams _ ; they also found a formula for the multivariable alexander polynomial @xmath3 of graph links in terms of the splice diagram ( see ( [ thm : multi - alex ] ) below ) .",
    "since the conway potential function is determined up to a sign by @xmath3 , the only problem is to compute this sign .    in 1999",
    ", walter neumann @xcite succeeded in computing the conway polynomial ( that is : the one variable potential function ) of any fibered solvable link . in this article , neumann proves several formulas for fibered solvable links , and asks whether these equalities still hold for any graph link . in this paper , we compute the multivariable potential function of any ( fibered or non - fibered ) graph link in a homology sphere ( theorem [ theorem : cpf ] ) .",
    "as a consequence , we give a positive answer to neumann s questions ( corollaries [ cor:1 ] , [ cor:2 ] and [ cor:3 ] ) .",
    "in 1970 , conway @xcite introduced a new invariant of links called the _ potential function_. given an oriented ordered link @xmath4 in @xmath2 , its potential function is a well defined rational function @xmath5 which satisfies @xmath6 where @xmath7 means equal up to a multiplication by @xmath8 .",
    "thus , this invariant is basically the multivariable alexander polynomial without the ambiguity concerning multiplication by units of @xmath9 $ ] . as a particular case of the potential function ,",
    "conway defined what was later called the _",
    "conway polynomial _ of a non - ordered link @xmath0 .",
    "it is given by @xmath10 unfortunately , conway s paper contains neither a precise definition of the potential function , nor a proof of its uniqueness .    in 1981",
    ", kauffman @xcite found a very simple geometric construction of the conway polynomial , namely @xmath11 where @xmath12 is any seifert matrix of the link @xmath0 and @xmath13 the transpose of @xmath12 .",
    "finally , in 1983 , hartley @xcite gave a definition of the multivariable potential function @xmath14 for any ordered oriented link in @xmath2 .",
    "this definition was later extended by turaev @xcite to links in a @xmath15-homology @xmath1-sphere , and by boyer and lines @xcite to links in a @xmath16-homology @xmath1-sphere .",
    "let us now state several useful properties of the potential function ; we refer to @xcite for the proofs . given an oriented ordered link @xmath4 in a @xmath15-homology sphere , there exists a well defined invariant @xmath14 related to the multivariable alexander polynomial @xmath3 of @xmath0 by the equality ( [ equ : alex ] ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath14 satisfies the symmetry formula @xmath17 also , if @xmath18 , where @xmath19 denotes @xmath20 with the opposite orientation , then @xmath21 finally , if @xmath22 , we have the following _ torres formula _ : @xmath23 where @xmath24 stands for the linking number @xmath25 .",
    "eisenbud and neumann @xcite gave a classification of graph links using splice diagrams .",
    "following neumann @xcite , we will not recall the whole construction here , just several important features of these combinatorial objects .",
    "a splice diagram @xmath26 for a graph link @xmath0 is a tree decorated as follows :    some of its valency one vertices are drawn as arrowheads , and correspond to the components of @xmath0 ;    the arrowheads have weight @xmath27 or @xmath28 ( depending on whether the corresponding component of @xmath0 has `` intrinsic '' orientation or not ) ;    each edge has an integer weight at any end where it meets a _ node _ ( vertex of valency greater than one ) , and all the edge weights around a node are pairwise coprime .    given a non - arrowhead vertex @xmath29 of @xmath26 , there is a so - called _ virtual component _",
    "@xmath30 : this is the additional link component that would correspond to a single arrow at @xmath29 with edge weight @xmath31 .",
    "it is very easy , given two vertices @xmath29 and @xmath32 , to compute the linking number @xmath33 of their corresponding components ( virtual or genuine ) : if @xmath34 denotes the shortest path in @xmath26 joining @xmath29 and @xmath32 ( including @xmath29 and @xmath32 ) , then @xmath33 is the product of the edge weights adjacent to but not on @xmath34 , and of the possible arrowhead weights .",
    "let us now recall eisenbud and neumann s formula for the multivariable alexander polynomial of a graph link ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 12.1 ) . if @xmath4 is a graph link given by a splice diagram @xmath26 , its multivariable alexander polynomial is equal to @xmath35 where the product is over all non - arrowhead vertices @xmath29 of @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the valency of the vertex @xmath29 , and @xmath38 denotes the linking number of @xmath39 with @xmath40 . in this equation ,",
    "the terms of the form @xmath41 should be formally cancelled against each other before being set equal to zero .    in proving this theorem , eisenbud and neumann",
    "also show another remarkable result ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 12.2 ) .",
    "let us call an @xmath42-component link _ algebraically split _ if , after possible renumbering , there is an index @xmath43 such that @xmath44 whenever @xmath45 .",
    "the theorem says that if @xmath0 is a graph link , then @xmath46    this is a very striking property of graph links .",
    "for example , it implies that the alexander polynomial @xmath3 of a @xmath47-component graph link is zero if and only if the linking number @xmath48 of the components is zero . for general @xmath47-component links",
    "@xmath0 , if @xmath3 vanishes , then @xmath49 ( by the torres formula ) .",
    "but the converse is false : the whitehead link has alexander polynomial @xmath50 , although @xmath49 . as a matter of fact",
    ", it is still an open question how to characterize geometrically @xmath47-component links with vanishing alexander polynomial ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* problem 16 ) ) .    before stating and proving our results ,",
    "let us finally recall very briefly neumann s argument @xcite for fibered solvable links .",
    "let @xmath0 be an oriented graph link given by a splice diagram @xmath26 . using the value of the one variable alexander polynomial @xmath3 of @xmath0 , together with the equality @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the degree of @xmath3",
    ", we obtain the formula @xmath53 where the product is over all non - arrowhead vertices of @xmath26 , @xmath37 is the valency of the vertex @xmath29 , and @xmath54 denotes the linking number of @xmath0 with @xmath40 .",
    "thus , the only issue is the determination of the sign of @xmath55 .",
    "if @xmath0 is a fibered link , its seifert matrix @xmath12 is unimodular .",
    "therefore , the leading coefficient of @xmath56 is given by @xmath57 .",
    "for fibered links , lee rudolph defined an integer invariant @xmath58 called the _ enhanced milnor number_. if the ambient sphere is @xmath2 , this number is known to satisfy the following formula ( see @xcite ) : @xmath59 neumann proves that @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the number of @xmath62-weighted arrowheads and @xmath63 the number of non - arrowhead vertices @xmath29 for which @xmath54 is negative and @xmath37 is odd .",
    "this leads to @xmath64 giving the formula @xmath65 these results lead neumann to the following questions :    is the formula @xmath66 true for any graph link in a homology sphere  ?    does the equality @xmath67 hold for fibered graph links in a homology sphere  ?    is the equation @xmath68 still valid for fibered graph links in a homology sphere  ?",
    "corollaries [ cor:1 ] , [ cor:2 ] and [ cor:3 ] provide an affirmative answer to these three questions .",
    "we are now ready to state and prove our results . using ( [ thm : multi - alex ] ) along with the equations ( [ equ : alex ] ) and ( [ equ : sym ] ) , it is easy to compute the conway potential function up to a sign .",
    "by ( [ thm : multi - alex ] ) and equation ( [ equ : alex ] ) , @xmath5 is equal to @xmath71 for some integers @xmath72 and some sign @xmath73 . the symmetry formula ( [ equ : sym ] ) implies that @xmath74 , giving the lemma .",
    "let us use kauffman s construction of the reduced potential function @xmath79 where @xmath12 is any seifert matrix for @xmath75 .",
    "it is easy to check that the seifert matrix for a graph knot @xmath75 is equal to the seifert matrix for the knot @xmath80 obtained from @xmath75 by deleting every non - fibered splice component .",

    "therefore , we can assume that @xmath75 is fibered .",
    "in that case , @xmath12 is unimodular . in particular",
    ", @xmath57 is non - zero , so that @xmath57 is the leading coefficient of @xmath83 .",
    "there is an explicit computation of @xmath12 for graph knots in @xcite ; it can be used to check the lemma .",
    "details can be found in @xcite .",
    "let us associate to @xmath0 a graph @xmath86 as follows : the vertices of @xmath86 correspond to the components of @xmath0 , and two vertices are linked with an edge if the linking number of the corresponding components is not equal to zero .",
    "clearly , @xmath0 is algebraically split if and only if @xmath86 is not connected . given a vertex @xmath29 of a graph @xmath87 ,",
    "let us denote by @xmath88 the subgraph obtained by deleting the vertex @xmath29 and every edge adjacent to @xmath29 .",
    "we are left with the proof of the following assertion : given a graph @xmath87 , if @xmath88 is not connected for any vertex @xmath29 of @xmath87 , then @xmath87 is not connected .",
    "in other words : if @xmath87 is a connected graph , there exists a vertex @xmath29 such that @xmath88 is connected .",
    "this last statement is very easy to prove : given @xmath87 a connected graph , let @xmath89 be a maximal subtree of @xmath87 . since @xmath89 is a tree , it has at least one vertex @xmath29 of degree one . then , @xmath90 is connected , as well as @xmath88 .    [ theorem : cpf ] let @xmath0 be a graph link with @xmath42 components given by a splice diagram @xmath26 .",
    "then , its conway potential function is equal to @xmath91 where the product is over all non - arrowhead vertices @xmath29 of @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the valency of the vertex @xmath29 , @xmath92 , and @xmath61 is equal to the number of @xmath62-weighted arrowheads .    by formula ( [ equ : inv ] )",
    ", it may be assumed that all the arrowheads have weight @xmath76 . using the notation of lemma [ lemma : uptosign ]",

    "let us fix some @xmath97 , and assume that @xmath98 for all graph link @xmath99 with @xmath100 arrowheads , all @xmath76-weighted .",

    "by lemma [ lemma : split ] , it follows that @xmath0 is algebraically split , so that @xmath102 . in this case",
