    "a well - known fact is that the formation of stable dissipative solitons ",
    "most typically , in lasing media @xcite and plasmonic cavities @xcite  relies upon the simultaneous balance of competing conservative and dissipative effects in the system , i.e. , respectively , the diffraction and self - focusing nonlinearity , and linear and nonlinear loss and gain @xcite .",
    "the generic model describing media where stable dissipative solitons emerge via this mechanism is based on the complex ginzburg - landau ( cgl ) equations with the cubic - quintic ( cq ) combination of gain and loss terms , which act on top of the linear loss lasers .",
    "in addition to modeling the laser - physics and plasmonic settings , the cgl equations , including their cq variety , serve as relevant models in many other areas , well - known examples being bose - einstein condensates in open systems ( such as condensates of quasi - particles in solid - state media ) @xcite , reaction - diffusion systems @xcite , and superconductivity @xcite .",
    "thus , the cgl equations constitute a class of universal models for the description of nonlinear waves and pattern formation in dissipative media @xcite .",
    "the cgl equation with the cq nonlinearity was originally postulated by petviashvili and sergeev @xcite as a model admitting stable localized two - dimensional ( 2d ) patterns .",
    "subsequently , systems of this type were derived or introduced phenomenologically in many physical settings , and a great deal of 1d and 2d localized solutions , i.e. , dissipative solitons , have been studied in detail in them @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a 2d model of laser cavities with an internal transverse grating , based on the cq - cgl equation supplemented by a spatially periodic ( lattice ) potential , which represents the grating , was introduced in ref .",
    "note that the currently available laser - writing technology makes it possible to fabricate permanent gratings in bulk media @xcite .",
    "in addition , in photorefractive crystals virtual photonic lattices may be induced by pairs of pump laser beams with the ordinary polarization , which illuminate the sample in the directions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , while the probe beam with the extraordinary polarization is launched along axis @xmath2 moti - general .",
    "in fact , the laser cavity equipped with the grating may be considered as a photonic crystal built in the active medium .",
    "periodic potentials are also known in passive optical systems , driven by external laser beams and operating in the temporal domain , unlike the spatial - domain dynamics of the active systems . in such systems , effective lattices",
    "may be induced by spatial modulation of the pump beam firth , advances . a notable fact reported in ref .",
    "@xcite is that localized vortices , built as sets of four peaks pinned to the periodic potential , may be stable without the presence of the diffusion term in the cgl laser model , which is necessary for the stabilization of dissipative vortex solitons in uniform media , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , but is unphysical for waveguiding models ( the diffusion term is relevant in models describing light trapped in a cavity , where the evolutional variable is time , rather than the propagation distance @xcite ) . in subsequent works ,",
    "stable fundamental and vortical solitons in 2d @xcite and 3d @xcite cgl models with trapping potentials were studied in detail .",
    "spatiotemporal dissipative solitons in the cq - cgl  model of 3d laser cavities including the transverse grating were investigated too @xcite . both fundamental and vortical",
    "solitons were found in a numerical form as attractors in the latter model , and their stability against strong random perturbations was tested by direct simulations .",
    "while the stability of various 2d localized patterns has been studied thoroughly in the framework of the cq - cgl equations with the transverse lattice potential used as the stabilizing factor , a challenging problem is mobility of such 2d dissipative solitons under the action of a kick applied across the underlying lattice .",
    "actually , the action of the kick in this context implies the application of a tilt to the beam .",
    "it should be noted that the cgl equation models single - pass optical amplifiers , as well as laser cavities . in the latter case the evolution",
    "is considered in the temporal domain , while in the former the evolution variable is the propagation distance . in order to build the required initial data in a laser cavity",
    ", the tilt should be applied very quickly .",
    "this may be achieved by means of an optically induced grating or mirrors , using some fast device . on the other hand , in the single - pass amplifier",
    "the input is an incident beam , the tilt being a mere misalignment between the beam and the amplifier s axis .",
    "below , we present the analysis in terms of the amplifier s setup , which is more straightforward for the experimental implementation .",
    "thus , we assume that an external source produces a beam , which is shaped into the fundamental - soliton mode of the amplifier by means of an adequate setup .",
    "then , the direction of this input beam is slightly tilted with respect to the amplifier s axis , allowing the transverse part of the beam s momentum to acts as the kick applied to the fundamental spatial soliton .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate that the effective hopping motion of the kicked soliton through cells of the periodic potential can be used for controlled creation of various patterns filling these cells ( or a part of them ) .    thus , the main objective of this work is to study the mobility of the 2d fundamental solitons , and scenarios of the pattern formation by kicked ones , in the framework of the cq - cgl models with the lattice potential .",
    "the model is formulated in section ii , which also presents an analytical approximation , that , using the concept of the peierls - nabarro ( pn )  barrier , makes it possible to predict , with a reasonable accuracy , the minimum ( threshold ) strength of the kick necessary for depinning of the quiescent soliton trapped by the lattice .",
    "the main numerical results for the mobility of the kicked soliton , and various scenarios of the pattern creation in the wake of the soliton hopping between cells of the potential lattice , are reported in section iii , while section iv deals with collisions between a freely moving soliton and a standing structure created and left by it , in the case of periodic boundary conditions ( which correspond to a pipe - shaped amplifier , i.e. , one in the form of a hollow cylinder ) .",
    "in particular , elastic collisions provide for an example of a soliton newton s cradle .",
    "the paper is concluded by section v.",
    "following refs . @xcite and @xcite , the scaled cq - cgl equation for the evolution of the amplitude of the electromagnetic field , @xmath3 , in two dimensions with transverse coordinates @xmath4 , along the propagation direction , @xmath5 ,",

    "the transverse grating is represented by the periodic potential , @xmath12 ,   \\label{v}\\]]of depth @xmath13 , with the period scaled to be @xmath14 .",
    "localized modes produced by eq .",
    "( [ cgl ] ) , which physically correspond to light beams self - trapped in the @xmath15 plane , are characterized by the total power , @xmath16    in the simulations , eq .",
    "( [ cgl ] ) was solved by means of the standard fourth - order runge - kutta scheme in the @xmath5-direction , and five - point finite - difference approximation for the transverse laplacian .",
    "as specified below , we used periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the integration domain correspond to an @xmath17 matrix of @xmath18 grid points covering the area of @xmath19 .",
    "generic results for the mobility of fundamental dissipative solitons can be adequately represented by fixing the following set of parameters : @xmath20for which the quiescent fundamental soliton is stable .      in simulations of eq .",
    "( [ cgl ] ) , the kick ( i.e. , tilt ) was applied to the self - trapped beam , as usual , by multiplying the respective steady state , @xmath21 , by @xmath22 , with the vectorial strength of the kick defined as @xmath23where the square - lattice symmetry of potential ( [ v ] ) makes it sufficient to confine the orientation angle , @xmath24 , to interval @xmath25 . in terms of the amplifier setup ,",
    "a small angle @xmath26 between the carrier wave vector @xmath27 of the beam ( in physical units ) and the @xmath5-axis , gives rise to the transverse component @xmath28 which corresponds to the kick .",
    "the paraxial approximation implies that @xmath29 before studying effects induced by the kick , it is relevant to explain the corresponding physical setting in more detail , making it sure that the tilted beams remain within the confines of the paraxial description .    equation ( [ cgl ] ) can be derived from the underlying wave equation by means of the standard slowly varying envelope approximation ( svea ) rosa . for this purpose , electric field @xmath30 ( in its scalar form )",
    "is split into a slowly varying amplitude and the rapidly oscillating carrier either as @xmath31where @xmath32 are the coordinates and time in physical units , @xmath33 is the group velocity , and @xmath34 stands the complex conjugate , or , alternatively , as @xmath35the difference is that that carrier wave is oblique in eq .",

    "thus , the svea can be fixed in the form of eq .",
    "( [ dec2 ] ) , with @xmath39 , where @xmath40 the linear index of the medium .",
    "further , to proceed to normalized equation ( [ cgl ] ) , we set @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is a characteristic scale of the beam s width  say , @xmath43 @xmath44 m for narrow beams , if the underlying wavelength ( in vacuum ) is @xmath45 @xmath44 m .",
    "accordingly , the period of grating ( [ v ] ) is @xmath46 in the physical units .",
    "note that @xmath43 @xmath44 m corresponds to the period @xmath47 @xmath44 m , which is relevant estimate ( gratings with the period on this order of magnitude can be readily manufactured ) .",
    "then , the scaled propagation distance is @xmath48 , and the scale wave amplitude is@xmath49where @xmath50 is the third - order nonlinear susceptibility .",
    "further , the respective rescaling of the wave vector components is given by @xmath51 .",
    "thus , the deviation angle can be estimated as @xmath52 , and , for generic tilted modes , with @xmath53 in the scaled notation , condition ( [ parax ] ) for the validity of the paraxial approximation amounts to @xmath54 , which is nothing but the standard paraxial assumption .    with the above - mentioned typical values , @xmath55 @xmath44 m and @xmath43 @xmath44 m , along with @xmath56 , the above estimate yields @xmath57 ( in radians ) .",
    "then , the minimum propagation distance relevant to the experiment , @xmath58 cm , corresponds to the transverse deviation of the tilted beam @xmath59 @xmath60 m , which can be easily detected and employed in applications .",
    "the first characteristic of kink - induced effects is the threshold value , @xmath61 , such that the soliton remains pinned at @xmath62 and escapes at @xmath63.to develop an analytical approximation which aims to predict the threshold , one can , at the lowest order , drop the loss and gain terms , as well as the lattice potential , in eq .",

    "<S> we consider the kick ( tilt)-induced mobility of two - dimensional ( 2d ) fundamental dissipative solitons in models of bulk lasing media based on the 2d complex ginzburg - landau ( cgl ) equation including a spatially periodic potential ( transverse grating ) . </S>",
    "<S> the depinning threshold , which depends on the orientation of the kick , is identified by means of systematic simulations , and estimated by means of an analytical approximation . </S>",
    "<S> various pattern - formation scenarios are found above the threshold . most typically , </S>",
    "<S> the soliton , hopping between potential cells , leaves arrayed patterns of different sizes in its wake . in the single - pass - amplifier setup , this effect may be used as a mechanism for the selective pattern formation controlled by the tilt of the input beam . freely moving solitons feature two distinct values of the established velocity . </S>",
    "<S> elastic and inelastic collisions between free solitons and pinned arrayed patterns are studied too . </S>"
