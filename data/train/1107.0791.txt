    "the modal amplitudes in the fourier decomposition of any homogeneous random field are uncorrelated . in a gaussian random field , they are also statistically independent ; but in homogeneous turbulence , nonlinearity produces statistical dependence among the amplitudes .",
    "the simplest consequence is that the third - order correlations representing energy transfer , which would vanish in a gaussian random field , do not vanish in homogeneous turbulence .",
    "some further consequences of statistical dependence of fourier amplitudes in homogeneous turbulence were considered in an important paper by chen , herring , kerr and kraichnan,@xcite which compared various fourth - order moments with the corresponding moments in a gaussian random field with the same second - order properties as the turbulent velocity field ( the construction of such gaussian surrogates is sometimes called ` kinematic simulation ' @xcite ) . among the quantities investigated by chen _",

    "one of the mechanisms which can lead to this _ depression of nonlinearity _ is the preferential alignment of velocity and vorticity , also called _",
    "beltramization_.@xcite however , this preferential alignment is not the only non - trivial mechanism which is consistent with the depression of nonlinearity ; we will return to this issue in section [ sec : discussion ] .    from the viewpoint of a fourier analysis of the spectrum of the correlation in eq .",
    "( [ nonl ] ) , the depression of nonlinearity is a consequence of statistical dependence of the uncorrelated fourier amplitudes that enter the expression for this spectrum .",
    "one finding of chen _ et al .",
    "_ was that this phenomenon appears to be well predicted by kraichnan s @xcite direct interaction approximation ( dia ) .",
    "the successful prediction of a nonzero fourth - order cumulant by a closure theory might seem unexpected or even surprising , since from the very beginning , closure theories have been associated with cumulant discard hypotheses;@xcite the debate between kraichnan and proudman at the famous 1961 marseille conference @xcite centered on this issue.@xcite the computation of a nonzero cumulant and the favorable comparison with data perhaps vindicate , somewhat after the fact , kraichnan s assertion at that time,@xcite that dia _ does not assume ( or imply ) the vanishing of fourth order cumulants . _    in the present work we will show that an effect of statistical dependence of fourier amplitudes analogous to depression of nonlinearity also appears in the advection of a passive scalar @xmath1 .",

    "( [ nonl ] ) : the variance of fluctuations of the bilinear scalar - velocity coupling @xmath2 herring and mtais @xcite have shown that this quantity is smaller in passive scalar advection than it would be if the fourier amplitudes of velocity and scalar were statistically independent , even at the more refined level of fourier spectra .",
    "we confirm their conclusions using higher resolution dns data , and following chen _ et al .",
    "_ , show that closures related to the dia predict trends consistent with the data .",
    "a different perspective on non - gaussian properties of turbulence is provided by recent detailed studies of the properties of realizations of turbulent velocity fields .",
    "such studies , made possible by high resolution direct numerical simulations,@xcite reveal the existence of flow structures such as vortex tubes and sheets , and spotty regions of very high dissipation ; in comparison , since a gaussian random field is simply space- and time - filtered white noise , it is expected to be essentially ` featureless . '",
    "this viewpoint makes the existence of such structures the most significant effect of non - gaussianity in turbulence . in the present paper we focus on a statistical characterization of non - gaussian features in turbulence and do not investigate features of the instantaneous flow realizations .",

    "these correlations are then _ modeled _ by the damping provided by @xmath20 ; then the transfer of scalar fluctuations between modes is treated in dia as the result of this damping acting against the forcing .",
    "perhaps the most important qualitative feature to note is that the theory requires two - time statistics : this complication is inevitable given that dia attempts to describe complex bilinear interactions by means of second - order statistics alone .",

    "corresponding to depression of nonlinearity is a reduction of the variance of the advection term , which is connected to a tendency of the velocity vector to align perpendicular to the scalar gradient .",
    "study at the level of fourier spectra shows that the reduction of advection is approximately constant in the inertial - convective range and becomes weaker in the viscous - convective ( batchelor ) range .",
