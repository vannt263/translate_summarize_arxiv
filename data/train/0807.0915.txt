    "one interesting candidate process in the indirect search for non - standard physics is the rare inclusive @xmath0 decay @xcite . due to its low sensitivity to non - perturbative effects and ,",
    "being a flavour - changing neutral current , its loop - suppression in the standard model ( sm ) stringent constraints on the parameter space of physics beyond the sm can be derived from both accurate measurements and precise theory predictions .",
    "the latest measurements by babar , belle and cleo @xcite have been combined by the heavy flavour averaging group ( hfag ) @xcite into the current world average ( wa ) for the branching ratio , @xmath1 where a cut @xmath2  gev has been imposed on the photon energy in the @xmath3-meson rest frame .",
    "the first uncertainty corresponds to a combined statistical and systematical error , the second one is due to the theory input in the extrapolation of the measured branching ratio to the reference value @xmath4 , whereas the third one is connected to the subtraction of @xmath5 contamination . on the theory side , the expected size of next - to - next - to leading order ( nnlo ) qcd effects to the partonic decay",
    "@xmath6 is comparable with the overall experimental error of about 7% and therefore a complete sm calculation at this level of accuracy is clearly needed .",
    "the recent theoretical estimate of the branching ratio at the nnlo level @xmath1 was derived in @xcite after a large part of the nnlo program has been finished and is in good agreement with the wa .",
    "the uncertainty here consists of four types of error added in quadrature : non - perturbative ( 5% ) , parametric ( 3% ) , higher - order ( 3% ) and @xmath7-interpolation ambiguity ( 3% ) .",
    "large logarithms of the form @xmath8 appear in qcd corrections to the partonic decay width @xmath9 and have to be resummed with renormalization - group techniques to get a reasonable prediction . most suitably , this is done in the framework of an effective low - energy theory with five active quarks by integrating out the heavy electroweak and the top fields in the sm . as a consequence ,",
    "local flavour - changing operators @xmath10 up to dimension six and wilson coefficients @xmath11 appear in the resulting effective lagrangian @xmath12 .",
    "a few years ago , the next - to - leading order qcd corrections to the @xmath13 decay have been completed ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the next - to - next - to leading order evaluation , which is a very complicated task , is currently under way and large parts are already finished . in general , three steps are required for a consistent calculation in the low - energy effective theory and in particular also at the nnlo level :    1 .",
    "determination of wilson coefficients @xmath14 at the electroweak scale @xmath15 by requiring equality of green s functions in the effective and full theory at leading order in ( external momenta)/@xmath16 . to this precision ,",
    "the matching of the four quark operators @xmath17 and the dipole operators @xmath18 at the two- and three - loop level , respectively , has been computed in @xcite .",
    "derivation of the effective theory renormalization group equations ( rge ) and computation of the operator mixing under renormalization by evolving the wilson coefficients @xmath11 from @xmath19 down to the low scale @xmath20 using the anomalous dimension matrix up to @xmath21 . in the sectors",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 , the three - loop renormalization was found in @xcite .",

    "3 .   calculation of on - shell matrix elements with single insertions of effective operators at @xmath20 to @xmath24 .",
    "this task is not completed yet , although a number of contributions is known . in @xcite , the two - loop matrix element of the dipole operator @xmath25 together with the corresponding bremsstrahlung",
    "was determined , confirmed in @xcite and subsequently extended to include the full charm quark mass dependence in @xcite .",
    "dominant contributions to the photon energy spectrum in the so - called large-@xmath26 approximation @xmath27 have been obtained in @xcite .",
    "using an expansion in @xmath28 the @xmath29 contributions to the two - loop matrix elements of @xmath25 and @xmath30 , as well as to the three - loop matrix elements @xmath31 and @xmath32 , were found in @xcite .",
    "these results have been confirmed in @xcite and , moreover , the full fermionic corrections beyond the large-@xmath26 approximation have been provided there .",
    "the full matrix elements of @xmath31 and @xmath32 at @xmath33 constitute an important piece that is still missing . at nlo",
    "the choice of scale and scheme of @xmath7 constitutes the main source of uncertainty stemming from the fact , that these operators contain the charm quark and contribute for the first time at @xmath34 .",
    "removing this ambiguity is therefore a nnlo effect in the branching ratio .",
    "so far , the full matrix elements of the @xmath31 and @xmath32 operators have been evaluated in the large @xmath7 limit , @xmath35 , and subsequently used for an interpolation to the physical range of @xmath7 @xcite assuming some ad - hoc value at @xmath36 .",
    "this is the source of the aforementioned interpolation ambiguity in the current nnlo branching ratio estimate .",
    "removing this uncertainty requires the calculation of @xmath37 at physical @xmath7 and involves the evaluation of hundreds of on - shell three - loop vertex diagrams with two scales @xmath38 and @xmath7 .",
    "reducing this interpolation uncertainty is possible by computing the matrix elements at @xmath39 and thus fixing the endpoint of the interpolation .",
    "both evaluations are currently being pursued .",
    "this paper is meant to describe the current status .",
    "the effective low - energy theory , in which the calculation of @xmath40 at @xmath24 is performed , is given by the effective lagrangian @xmath41 the first term corresponds to the usual qed - qcd lagrangian for the light sm fields , the second term gives the local operator product expansion , @xmath42 are the matrix elements of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix and @xmath43 is the fermi coupling constant .",
    "the relevant physical operators are chosen as @xcite @xmath44 @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 stand for various products of dirac and colour matrices .",
    "as already mentioned , removing the interpolation uncertainty requires the calculation of @xmath48 matrix elements at the nnlo level .",
    "all appearing vertex diagrams have been generated , expressed through scalar diagrams that depend on the two mass scales @xmath7 and @xmath38 and finally reduced with laporta s algorithm to 476 master integrals .",
    "the latter can be evaluated using two different approaches : numerical solutions of differential equations or the mellin - barnes technique .",
    "the first method consists of writing down differential equations for the master integrals in their kinematical invariants and solving them numerically after an expansion about some limit has been taken to provide the startpoint for integration with high precision .",
    "this was already used in the calculation of double fermionic qcd corrections to the photon polarization function @xcite . moreover , in @xcite this idea was also applied to determine the full mass dependence of the @xmath49-production cross - section from light quarks at nnlo .",
    "the second approach is based on the mellin - barnes ( mb ) technique , where mb representations can be derived in an automatized way , analytically continued in @xmath50 and numerically integrated utilizing the package ` mb ` @xcite .",
    "both methods have been used to obtain the full fermionic corrections , extending the so far known massless case to include heavy @xmath51 and @xmath52 quark loops @xcite . as a result , it turned out that while the charm quark contribution is well reproduced by the massless approximation , bottom quark loop insertions are overestimated by a large extent . for the remaining bosonic parts the ibp reduction is still under way .",
    "[ fig : o2o7graph ]        in the limit @xmath39 valuable information can be obtained from @xmath37 to fix the endpoint of the interpolation performed in @xcite .",
    "a possible way of getting @xmath37 is by interfering the matrix elements of the operators @xmath48 with those of the dipole operator @xmath25 and cutting the resulting four - loop propagators selectively .",
    "the final state is required to contain at least one @xmath53 quark and one photon .",
    "altogether , several hundreds of four - loop propagator - like diagrams are generated with up to five - particle cuts and subsequently reduced to about 200 master integrals that have to be evaluated .",
    "the massless cases among them have already been computed up to four - particle cuts using a mellin - barnes based method .",
    "for this task , mellin - barnes representations have been derived and numerically evaluated after performing the necessary phase space integrations .",
    "however , integrals containing massive lines from virtual @xmath51-quarks require a different approach .",
    "the method we are currently using in this respect is again based on differential equations ( deq ) , but it turns out to be more involved as compared to the virtual corrections at @xmath54 . as starting point for the expansion and integration of the system of deq",
    "we choose the large mass limit .",
    "thus , boundary conditions are given by cut integrals in the large mass limit and can be evaluated with automatized diagrammatic expansions and phase space integration .",
    "unfortunately , the usual approach of numerical integration up to the interesting kinematical point , to the on - shell limit in our case , suffers from divergences in the differential equations at both endpoints of the integration contour .",
    "this can be overcome by solving the system of deq with an expansion ansatz around the on - shell point .",
    "comparison of the numerical integration at some point close to the on - shell kinematics with the expansion fixes the boundary conditions of the latter . in the case of logarithmic on -",
    "shell divergences , the integrals are regularized with a sufficient number of irreducible numerators and a change of the basis of master integrals .    the achievable accuracy of this method is , on the one hand , given by the depth of the expansions at the starting and ending points on the integration contour and , on the other , by the error pile - up during numerical integration .",
