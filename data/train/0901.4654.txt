    "later kanke and navrotsky @xcite reported enthalpy measurements by drop - in calorimetry with different re - al oxides , but lualo@xmath5 was not measured in this report .",
    "it was claimed instead that lualo@xmath5 could only be prepared under high pressure ( which is obviously not true @xcite )  as the stability was said to be limited by the disproportionation reaction @xmath53 which would be in agreement with @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , equilibria with the monoclinic phase were not discussed further in @xcite and instead the decomposition of perovskite to garnet and lu@xmath3o@xmath5 was discussed quantitatively ( fig .  7 in @xcite ) .",

    "another issue of @xcite , however , is critical : dta peak temperatures were taken there to construct the phase diagram , but this is principally incorrect .",
    "the start of melting corresponds to extrapolated onset temperatures , and peak temperatures lead to a systematic overestimation of melting points @xmath60 during heating , and to underestimation of @xmath60 if cooling curves are used @xcite .",
    "the broad effects in the heating curve for @xmath37 @xmath61c were attributed by ding et al .",
    "@xcite to the partial decomposition of the perovskite , as described in equation ( [ eq : dis ] ) , and this interpretation was apparently justified by high temperature x - ray diffraction patterns .",
    "indeed , this explanation seems possible , but a phase transformation of the monoclinic phase lu@xmath2al@xmath3o@xmath4 is an alternative explanation : for the isomorphous yttrium compound y@xmath2al@xmath3o@xmath4 yamane et al @xcite found by neutron diffraction a phase transformation from a low-@xmath37 @xmath62 phase to a high-@xmath37 phase with identical space symmetry group .",

    "for some samples , the peak had a small shoulder on the high-@xmath37 side that could indicate the spacing between eutectic melting and liquidus temperatures ( e.g. @xmath74 in fig .",

    "a second peak due to the peritectic decomposition of lualo@xmath5 should be expected for al - rich compositions , but the thermal difference of the eutectic and the peritectic is only @xmath80k ( see fig .  [",

    "the measured dta peaks are by @xmath57k too low",
    "the maximum peak size was measured slightly to the lu - rich side ( @xmath92 ) from the lualo@xmath5 composition where it should be if the perovskite decomposed in the solid phase .",
    "such a strong thermal effect with large consumption of heat is expected to be the result of a melting process rather than a process between solid phases only .",
    "indeed it could be seen that the dta samples were really molten directly after passing the peak , if the dta measurement was stopped there .",
    "it can be concluded that under the current experimental conditions the phase diagram of wu et al .",
    "@xcite is correct .",
    "however , the question should be discussed why different results were found by others : petrosyan et al .",
    "@xcite write that their measurements were performed under argon / hydrogen atmosphere , with unspecified composition . moreover , it is claimed that ``  lu and al have stable oxidation states ( iii )  ( and ) changes in phase states of condensed systems will not depend on the change  of the partial pressure of oxygen in the co - existing gaseous phase '' .    in a previous paper @xcite petrosyan et al . used a mixture of 20vol.% h@xmath3 with",
