    "main sequence fitting is a basic tool used in the study of star clusters ; the principle behind it is also used to estimate distances to field main sequence ( ms ) stars .",
    "the hipparcos mission ( esa 1997 ) has provided parallaxes for a number of open cluster stars , which permits a direct determination of the distances to the open clusters which can be compared with distances obtained from ms fitting",
    ". there are surprising differences between distances obtained with these two methods ; in this paper we explore possible explanations for them .",
    "ms fitting relies upon the vogt - russell theorem : the location of a star in the hr diagram is uniquely specified by its mass , composition , and age .",
    "this implies that we can infer the distance of a given cluster by comparing the apparent magnitudes of cluster stars with the absolute magnitudes of stars with known composition and distance .",
    "there are several possible approaches .",
    "unevolved lower ms field stars with known distances or a cluster ( such as the hyades ) of known distance can be used to construct an empirical ms .",
    "the distance to the cluster is inferred from the vertical shift needed to line up the cluster ms with the empirical ms .",
    "clusters can also be compared with theoretical isochrones calibrated on the sun ; the latter method requires a color calibration which relates the model effective temperatures to the observed colors .",
    "most nearby open clusters are close to the sun in metal abundance , which minimizes uncertainties in the distance scale from variations in composition .",
    "there is also a large database of fundamental effective temperature measurements for stars near the solar [ fe / h ] , so the color calibrations should be relatively reliable .",
    "the nearby open clusters also have been extensively studied for membership , photometry , abundances , and reddening . for all of these reasons",
    "the open cluster distance scale has not been regarded as controversial , and evidence that ms fitting yields incorrect distances could have significant astrophysical importance .",
    "the hipparcos mission has resulted in a large increase in the number of open cluster stars with measured parallaxes .",
    "this data allows the distance scale inferred from ms fitting to be compared with the distance scale inferred from trigonometric parallaxes .",
    "the recently announced hipparcos determination of the mean parallax of the pleiades cluster gives the result @xmath3 milliarcsec ( van leeuwen & hansen ruiz 1997a ) .",
    "this corresponds to a distance of @xmath4 pc , or a distance modulus of @xmath5 magnitude .",
    "traditional determinations of the pleiades distance ( e.g. , vandenberg & bridges 1984 ; soderblom et al .",
    "1993 ) , comparing the cluster s main sequence to that of nearby stars , lead to a distance modulus of about 5.6 mag ( @xmath6 pc ; @xmath7 mas ) .",
    "thus the hipparcos parallax , being almost 1 mas larger than expected , suggests that the pleiades cluster stars are systematically @xmath8 magnitude fainter than we have thought up to now .",
    "parallaxes for stars in other clusters have also been measured , and the results are compared with those obtained from ms fitting in table 1 ( data taken from perryman et al .",

    "1997 , robichon et al .",
    "the standard reddening for the clusters is also indicated , along with a notation about whether or not differential reddening is present .",
    "the second column lists the cluster [ fe / h ] values from boesgaard & friel ( 1990 ) and friel & boesgaard ( 1992 ) ; we have adopted their abundance scale for the clusters in the present study ( see section 4 ) .",

    "we have adopted the mermilliod distance ; if we were to adopt the vh97b distance to the cluster we would have to add praesepe to the list of clusters with a significant ( 2 @xmath2 ) discrepancy between the ms fitting and hipparcos distance scales .",
    "the first column of distance moduli in table 1 lists the values cited as `` lynga '' by mermilliod et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and robichon et al .",
    "we note that these are _ apparent _ distance moduli , needing considerable ( up to 1.2 mag ) corrections for extinction , and can not be directly compared with the distance moduli @xmath30 calculated from the hipparcos parallaxes .",
    "the second column in table 1 lists the distance moduli which correspond to the cluster distances given in lynga s ( 1987 ) catalogue .",
    "these distances come from a variety of sources , are still scaled to a hyades distance modulus of 3.01 mag , and need corrections for each clusters metallicity .",
    "one motivation for our study is to place ms fitting distances for open clusters on a consistent scale . in a paper in preparation",
    ", we have found that the ms fitting distances to some of the more distant open clusters are substantially different from the lynga distances and in marked disagreement with the hipparcos parallax distances .",
    "a second question is the precision of ms fitting estimates ; we will show that accuracy at the 0.05 mag level is possible for well - studied systems .",
    "our results for the clusters studied in this paper are in the fourth column .",
    "discrepancies between the ms fitting distances and the hipparcos distances could arise from several sources . as indicated above , one possibility is that the ms fitting distances need to be rederived on a consistent scale .",
    "another possibility is that some of the basic properties of well - studied open clusters , such as composition , age , or reddening , need to be revised .",
    "if neither of these possibilities can reconcile the distance scales , then we are left with one of two important conclusions : either there are fundamental problems with ms fitting or there are unrecognized systematic errors in the hipparcos parallaxes themselves .",
    "these issues are important for other questions as well .",
    "for example , recent proposed revisions to the globular cluster distance and age scales , based on hipparcos parallaxes of subdwarfs , rely on the same ms fitting technique that gives rise to the puzzling distances to open clusters ( reid 1997 ; gratton et al . 1997 ; chaboyer et al . 1998 ; but see also pont et al .",
    "1998 ) .    in this paper",
    "we address the essential issues raised above .",
    "the pleiades , praesepe , and @xmath1 per are well - suited for a more detailed examination .",
    "there is good membership information and multicolor photometry for all three ; @xmath1 per is a system with an age comparable to that of the pleiades ( 50 myr vs. 100 myr ) and therefore it provides a test of age - related effects .",
    "we have also examined the coma ber star cluster , which has a low quoted error for its hipparcos distance . in a companion paper ( soderblom et al .",
    "1998 ) we have searched for field stars with accurate parallaxes and anomalous positions in the hr diagram .",
    "we begin by describing the theoretical models which we use and the open cluster data in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we begin with a comparison of the pleiades , praesepe , and @xmath1 per in different colors .",
    "we then use the hyades cluster to test the zero - point of our distance scale , check on the shape of the isochrones in the observational color - magnitude diagram , and to determine the sensitivity of distance estimates in different colors to changes in metal abundance .",
    "we then derive distance modulus estimates at both solar [ fe / h ] and the individual abundances inferred from high - resolution spectroscopy for the pleiades , coma ber , praesepe , and @xmath1 per using several different methods and both  and @xmath0 . the pleiades and coma ber are found to be in disagreement with the hipparcos distance scale .",
    "we discuss the sensitivity of our results to age , composition , and reddening in section 4 , and present evidence that the hipparcos parallaxes may contain small - scale ( @xmath311 deg ) systematic effects @xmath311 mas in size , large enough to cause the pleiades parallax discrepancy .",
    "our conclusions are in section 5 .",
    "theoretical stellar models were constructed with the yale stellar evolution code for a range of compositions . the nuclear reaction cross - sections are from bahcall , pinsonneault , & wasserburg ( 1995 ) .",
    "we use the saumon , chabrier , & van horn ( 1995 ) equation of state for temperatures less than @xmath32 k ; this eos is superior to the treatment in earlier versions of the yale evolution codes for the conditions present in low mass stars .",
    "the fully ionized eos in the yale code was used for higher temperatures ; in numerical tests this produced a ms indistinguishable from that obtained with the opal eos ( rogers , swenson , & iglesias 1996 ) .",
    "model atmospheres from kurucz ( 1991a ) were used as a surface boundary condition ; these are available for a range of metal abundances .",
    "we also constructed models ( for solar composition only ) using a grid of atmospheres kindly provided by f. allard ( see allard et al .",
    "1997 for a review ) .",
    "kurucz ( 1991b ) molecular opacities were used for temperatures less than @xmath33 k , and opal opacities ( rogers & iglesias 1992 ) were used for higher temperatures . the mixing length ( @xmath34 ) and helium abundance ( @xmath35 ) were calibrated by requiring that a solar model have the radius and luminosity of the sun at the age of the sun .",
    "we then generated models from [ fe / h]=-0.3 to [ fe / h]=+0.2 in 0.1 dex increments .",
    "at each metal abundance we ran a grid of masses from 0.2 - 1.6 @xmath36 in 0.1 @xmath36 increments .",
    "helium abundances for non - solar [ fe / h ] were obtained by combining the solar helium abundance with an assumed @xmath37y /@xmath37z = 2 .",
    "isochrones were constructed at a variety of ages , to account for the pre - ms nature of the lower mass stars in the young clusters .",
    "we also constructed a set of models with solar z but enhanced helium ( y=0.37 ) .",
    "the yale color calibration ( green 1988 ) was used to convert from the theoretical ( l , teff ) plane to the observational ( magnitude , color ) plane in  and @xmath0 .      for the open clusters the distance modulus estimates from hipparcos parallaxes",

    "fitting we restricted the sample to stars with  in the range 0.5 - 0.9 .",
    "distance modulus estimates for early - type stars can be affected by the assumed cluster age , and @xmath0 becomes a poor temperature indicator ; we therefore excluded stars with  colors less than 0.5 .",
    "the color calibrations become unreliable for late - type stars ; we therefore excluded stars with  colors greater than 0.9 from our main sequence fitting estimates .",
    "our choice of this color interval also makes our distance estimates insensitive to the adopted cluster ages .    for the photometry of open cluster stars , data was taken from several sources .",
    "for the hyades we used cluster members ( as determined by perryman et al .",
    "1997 ) which were considered to be single stars by griffin et al .",
    "we restricted the sample to stars with ri photometry ( on the johnson system ) from mendoza ( 1967 ) .",
    "since the hipparcos sample is magnitude - limited , including other stars in common between the perryman and griffin paper did not result in increasing the sample size significantly in the color range of interest , and including additional stars with ri colors measured in other systems raises the possibility of systematic color effects .",
    "individual parallaxes for the hyades stars were used to infer individual @xmath38 values and correct for depth effects .    for both the pleiades and praesepe , photometry for the upper ms stars",

    "@xmath1 per has patchy and variable differential reddening which is apparent in the cluster color - magnitude diagram ; we adopted @xmath39=0.10 ( see crawford & barnes 1974 , prosser 1994a ) .",

    "most work on cluster distances has used  colors as an effective temperature index . in figure 1",
    "we compare the pleiades to @xmath1 per and praesepe at the hipparcos distances in the observational ( @xmath38 versus ) plane .",
    "both praesepe and @xmath1 per are distinctly above the pleiades .",
    "this result is as disturbing as the discrepancies in table 1 because the measured [ fe / h ] of the three clusters are within 0.1 dex , implying that the cluster main sequences should be very close in this diagram ( within 0.1 magnitudes ) .",
    "the  color is highly metallicity sensitive , and the distances inferred from  are therefore quite sensitive to the adopted cluster [ fe / h ] values . if the true cluster abundances deviate from the currently accepted values then one might expect the cluster main sequences to be closer in a less metallicity - sensitive index , such as @xmath0 . the clusters are compared in @xmath49 in figure 2 .",
    "praesepe is closer to the pleiades in this index , which suggests that part of the difference in figure 1 is caused by a difference in chemical composition .",
    "however , the two cluster main sequences are still well separated in @xmath0 and the difference between the pleiades and @xmath1 per is the same in both colors .",
    "these figures illustrate both the magnitude of the problem and the difficulty in explaining it by either metallicity or age .",
    "to quantify this problem , we need to determine the sensitivity of distances based upon temperature measurements from  and @xmath0 to changes in composition .",
    "we show theoretical isochrones for 1 gyr populations with different abundances in figure 3 .",
    "the top , middle , and bottom panels are the theoretical plane , @xmath0 , and  respectively ; the yale color calibration was used for the bottom two panels .",
    "the width of the ms is different in each ; 0.5 dex in [ fe / h ] produces a range of @xmath50 mag in the theoretical plane , @xmath51 dex in v/@xmath0 , and @xmath52 dex in v/. helium variations affect the isochrones the same in all three planes : a 0.1 increase in y produces a 0.28 magnitude decrease in the locus of the main sequence .",
    "the isochrones are nearly parallel across the entire color range of interest .",
    "the alonso , arribas , & martinez - roger ( 1996 ) [ aar ] color calibration is an alternate method of converting from the theoretical to the observational plane .",
    "the aar color calibration is based on application of the infrared flux method , and it can be used to derive the sensitivity of different color indices to changes in metal abundance .",
    "the [ fe / h ] sensitivity of  in aar is comparable to that in the yale color calibration , but aar find that @xmath0 , at least in the johnson system , is metallicity independent : that is , that the changes in a @xmath0 based color magnitude diagram should faithfully reflect changes in the theoretical hr diagram . the hyades and praesepe clusters provide support for the aar findings on the metallicity sensitivity of @xmath0 , at least for systems near solar metal abundance .    if we adopt the yale color calibration , a 0.1 dex increase in [ fe / h ]",
    "produces a 0.12 magnitude decrease in @xmath38 at fixed  and a 0.09 magnitude decrease in @xmath38 at fixed @xmath0 .",
    "for example , this would imply that the hyades ( at [ fe / h]=+0.15 ) would lie 0.18 magnitudes above a solar composition isochrone in  and 0.135 magnitudes above a solar composition isochrone in @xmath0 . if the metallicity sensitivity of aar is adopted , then a 0.1 dex increase in [ fe / h ] produces a 0.13 magnitude decrease in @xmath38 at fixed  and a 0.06 magnitude decrease in @xmath38 at fixed @xmath0 .",
    "the yale color calibration implies that a color - color diagram in  and @xmath0 should be metallicity - insensitive because both indices are metallicity sensitive ( albeit to slightly different degrees ) ; the aar results would produce a wider spread in a color - color diagram because  is much more metallicity sensitive than @xmath0 .",
    "the local field stars span a range in [ fe / h ] , with the bulk of the f and g stars in the gliese catalog spanning a range from -0.3 to + 0.2 ( wyse & gilmore 1995 ; see also mcwilliams 1997 ) .",
    "we therefore expect a significant intrinsic width to the field star ms as well as a population of binary stars above the ms .",
    "the relative width of the ms in the  and @xmath0 planes can be used as a test of the relative sensitivities of the two color indices to [ fe / h ] .",
    "the hipparcos mission has provided parallaxes accurate to @xmath53 or better for a significant number of lower ms stars .",
    "there is a smaller sample ( 680 stars ) with both  and @xmath0 colors ; the field ms in both colors is compared with the models in figure 4 .",
    "the field ms is much tighter in @xmath0 than in , suggesting that much of the spread in figure 4 is caused by atmospheric effects ( the dependence of  color on metal abundance ) rather than by interiors effects .",
    "we therefore expect that there will be systematic differences between the derived distances in  and @xmath0 if the adopted [ fe / h ] for the isochrone departs from that of the star , or cluster , at the 0.07 ( aar ) or 0.03 ( yale ) magnitude level per 0.1 dex in [ fe / h ]",
    ". this discrepancy will be in the sense that the @xmath0 distance will be longer than  if the true metal abundance is higher and the @xmath0 distance will be shorter than the  distance if the true metal abundance is lower .",
    "the hyades cluster provides an opportunity to check the distances derived from ms fitting against the hipparcos distance scale for a system with a large number of measured parallaxes spread across a large region of the sky .",
    "we can also compare the isochrones in the theoretical plane and in different colors ; the hyades provides a useful check of the sensitivity of the isochrones to changes in metal abundance because it has a metal abundance 0.1 - 0.2 dex above solar .",
    "the perryman et al .",

    "this comparison indicates that systematic differences between different isochrones are at or below the 0.04 magnitude level overall and agree to within 0.03 magnitudes near the temperature of the sun .",
    "the hyades ms of perryman et al .",
    "is 0.164 magnitudes brighter than their solar [ fe / h ] isochrone in this temperature interval ; their isochrone with [ fe / h]=+0.14 and solar scaled helium would be too faint to be consistent with the data .",
    "they were therefore forced to a subsolar helium abundance ( 0.26 ) to reproduce the observed hyades ms .",

    "the average is 3.36 with a rms deviation of 0.16 .",
    "since the average error in @xmath38 is 0.13 , color errors are contributing little to the overall scatter in the diagram .",
    "since the parallax errors can be correlated , the error in the mean scales as @xmath59 , not @xmath60 ( lindegren 1988 , 1989 ) ; the formal error in the mean distance modulus estimate is therefore 0.05 . because of the nearness of the hyades the mean distance modulus estimate will depend on the subset of the stars used in the comparison , and therefore the difference between this estimate and the cluster mean of 3.33@xmath29 0.01 is not problematic .",
    "the difference ( @xmath38(observed ) - @xmath38(predicted ) ) for both colors is shown for the single stars as a function of color in figure 7 ; the difference between the isochrones and the empirical ms is also shown .",

    "the dispersion about the mean in both cases is 0.13 , consistent with the errors in the absolute magnitudes .",
    "the discrepancy between the distance estimates in  and @xmath0 could be reduced , or removed , by an increase in the adopted cluster metal abundance ; alternately , it could indicate that  is more metallicity sensitive and @xmath0 is less metallicity sensitive than predicted by the models .",
    "since increasing the hyades metal abundance would cause a disagreement with both the parallax distance to the cluster and the spectroscopic [ fe / h ] measurements we believe that the latter explanation is more likely .",
    "if we adopt the derivatives of @xmath38 with respect to [ fe / h ] from aar the mean for the   distance is 3.33 ( -0.03 ) and the mean for the @xmath0 distance is 3.36 ( 0.0 ) .",

    "we also compare the distance estimates derived from the isochrones and the distance estimates derived from the empirical hyades ms with the zero point adjusted to agree with the isochrones at one solar mass for the different colors .",
    "the hyades ms needs to be corrected for the higher than solar [ fe / h ] of the cluster ; the @xmath38 at fixed color for a solar abundance ms is 0.19 magnitudes higher at fixed  and 0.09 mag higher at fixed @xmath0 .",
    "the empirical ms that we adopted at solar metal abundance in  and @xmath0 respectively are therefore    @xmath61 and    @xmath62 ( valid only from 0.55 to 0.9 in @xmath0 ) .    for younger clusters the empirical hyades ms",
    "needs to be corrected for age effects ( a 0.04 magnitude level effect for the pleiades ) .",
    "we took the difference between our 100 and 600 myr isochrones and applied it to the relationships given above for the pleiades .",
    "we stress that the distances obtained in this manner have the same zero - point as the isochrones ; we are using the shape of the hyades ms and not its absolute distances , and our distance scale is therefore not tied to the distance to the hyades ( although it is in agreement with the cluster distance as measured by hipparcos ) .      in figure 9",
    "we present histograms of the distance modulus estimates for the pleiades using different techniques . in the top panels",
    "100 myr solar composition isochrones were used to estimate @xmath38 from  and @xmath0 respectively ; in the bottom panels the empirical hyades ms was used .",
    "the darker bins are for hotter stars and the lighter bins are for cooler stars ; a discrepancy between the mean of the two is an indication of a deviation between the shape of the isochrone and the cluster cmd . in the isochrone",
    "distances cooler stars give systematically longer distance modulus estimates at the 0.1 mag level ; these color trends are removed relative to the hyades ms fits in the lower panels .",
    "the good agreement between different techniques suggests that there are small internal errors in ms fitting for systems with good photometry .",
    "an average of the @xmath0 distance methods yields 5.63 @xmath29 0.02 , while an average of the  distance methods also gives 5.63 @xmath29 0.02 .",
    "this should be compared with the hyades , where a solar abundance isochrone would give distance modulus estimates that differ by 0.1 magnitudes ; this difference is caused by a cluster [ fe / h ] 0.15 dex higher than solar .",
    "if we add the errors in quadrature this implies that we have a 0.03 magnitude relative error in the  and @xmath0 distance estimates , which corresponds to a 0.05 magnitude error in the photometric [ fe / h ] .",
    "boesgaard & friel ( 1990 ) obtained [ fe / h ] = -0.034@xmath290.024 for the pleiades ; at this metal abundance our  and @xmath0 distance moduli are 5.59 and 5.61 respectively .",
    "our ms fitting distance to the pleiades is therefore 5.60 , and we estimate that errors in the metal abundance and systematic differences in the ms fitting technique are at the 0.04 magnitude level .    in figure 10",
    "we compare the pleiades to a [ fe / h]=-0.03 100 myr isochrone in both  and @xmath0 . the isochrone has been shifted to a distance of 5.60 .",
    "the isochrone is an excellent fit to the cluster cmd .",
    "we note that single rapid rotators are on or above the ms in @xmath0 but below it in ; this may indicate that the relationship between color and temperature for these stars is different than for slow rotators , and we therefore exclude them from distance estimates in both this cluster and @xmath1 per .",
    "a detailed binary inventory for the pleiades has recently been published ( bouvier , rigaut , & nadeau 1997 ; see also mermilliod et al .",
    "1992 ) , and we can therefore check for the possible impact of binary contamination on our distance estimates .",
    "we compare distance estimates for binaries , single stars , and rapid rotators in figure 11 .",
    "as expected , stars with very low distance estimates are binaries and for the high mass ratio binaries  is less sensitive than @xmath0 .",
    "the broader distributions for @xmath0 seen in figure 9 are therefore a reflection of its greater sensitivity to binary contamination .",
    "the techniques that we have applied do not appear to be affected significantly ; if we use only the single stars a slightly higher distance of 5.65 is indicated for both colors .    to reproduce the hipparcos distance of 5.33",
    "we would require [ fe / h ] = -0.25 for and [ fe / h ] = -0.45 for @xmath0 .",
    "reproducing the hipparcos distance to the pleiades by changing the metal abundance would therefore require a much lower metallicity than that obtained by high - resolution spectroscopy ; furthermore , the distance estimates for different colors would be in strong disagreement .",
    "other possibilities are discussed in section 4 .      in figure 12",
    "we present histograms of the distance modulus estimates for praesepe using different techniques ; as for the pleiades the top panels are relative to the isochrones ( 600 myr for praesepe ) and the bottom panels are relative to the isochrones with the shape adjusted to agree with the empirical hyades ms . particularly for",
    ", there is a clear indication that the distance estimates for the uncorrected isochrones depend on color at the 0.1 magnitude level ; this is more apparent for praesepe than for the pleiades largely because the praesepe sample includes more cool stars than the pleiades sample .",
    "however , the histogram peaks and medians are similar for the uncorrected isochrones and those obtained relative to the shape of the hyades ms .",
    "an average of the @xmath0 distance methods yields 6.17 @xmath29 0.02 , while an average of the distance methods yields 6.08 @xmath29 0.02 .",
    "this difference is significantly larger than our estimated relative error of 0.03 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the difference between the two is real and indicates that praesepe is mildly metal - rich .",
    "the two distance modulus estimates agree at [ fe / h]=+0.13 and a distance modulus of 6.25 .",
    "the friel & boesgaard ( 1992 ) [ fe / h ] for praesepe is + 0.04@xmath290.04 , while a higher abundance is inferred by some other studies ( see section 4.2 ) . at the fb92 [ fe / h ]",
    "the distance modulus is 6.13 in  and 6.19 in @xmath0 ; we therefore adopt a distance modulus estimate of 6.16 for praesepe ( figure 13 ) .",
    "this is well within the error bounds of the hipparcos distance estimate of 6.24@xmath290.12 .",
    "we conclude that praesepe is consistent within the errors with the hipparcos distance measurement and that the photometry is consistent with it being more metal - rich ( at the 0.1 dex level ) than the fb92 estimate .",
    "the dominant source of error in the distance modulus is the metal abundance of the clusters ; in general , relative metal abundances can be determined more precisely than absolute metal abundances .",
    "another way of looking at the problem of reconciling the ms fitting and hipparcos distance scales is therefore to look at relative distances in different colors and asking what metal abundance difference is needed to explain the results .",
    "the pleiades and praesepe are especially difficult to explain in combination . at solar [ fe / h ]",
    "the relative distances of these two clusters from ms fitting are 0.45 and 0.54 magnitudes in  and @xmath0 respectively . by comparison ,",
    "the magnitude difference between the two clusters for the hipparcos distance scale is 0.91 .",
    "if praesepe is metal - rich or the pleiades is metal poor then the true difference in distance modulus estimates will be larger than at solar [ fe / h ] , with  being more metallicity sensitive than @xmath0 . reconciling the relative cluster distances in  and @xmath0 by changing the metal abundances would require a metallicity difference of 0.35 dex and 0.6 dex respectively ; both are well outside the range of relative metal abundances reported by different investigators .",
    "@xmath1 per is a young system ( 50 myr ) , and it has a larger overall reddening ( 0.10 ) than the other clusters we examine and some differential reddening . in figure 14",
    "we show the distribution in distance modulus estimates in both  and @xmath0 relative to a solar composition 50 myr isochrone .",
    "there is a larger population of rapid rotators in this cluster than in the pleiades , and they show the same pattern ( long distances in  and short distances in @xmath0 ) .",
    "a subpopulation of stars at higher distances is present in both colors , with distances systematically higher for  than for @xmath0 .",
    "this could be caused by variable reddening , rapid rotators with low sin i , or contamination of the sample by non - members . excluding these stars",
    "only affects the distance estimates at the 0.02 magnitude level and does not change the relative distances in the two colors .",
    "there is a well - defined peak in  at a distance of 6.275 and the distribution for @xmath0 is centered at the same distance ; the median of the single stars is at 6.29 and 6.27 for  and @xmath0 respectively , giving average distances of 6.28 and 6.27 for the two colors .",
    "therefore , at solar abundance the average cluster distance is 6.28 ; there is a hint of a mild metal deficiency in the relative distances in the two colors , at the 0.02 dex level .",
    "if we adopt the high - resolution abundance [ fe / h]=-0.05 our average distance is 6.23 ; because the error in the metal abundance is higher for this system than for the others ( 0.05 ) the error is larger , 0.06 magnitudes .",
    "a 50 myr isochrone is compared with the cluster in figure 15 .",
    "significantly , there is no evidence for a discrepancy between the ms fitting and hipparcos distance scales ; because both @xmath1 per and the pleiades are young , this indicates that the problem with the pleiades is not a consequence of systematic color errors arising from the youth of the system .",
    "coma ber is a sparse cluster with an age comparable to the hyades ; it is mildly metal - poor ( [ fe / h]=@xmath63 ; see taylor 1994 ) .",
    "surveys have been undertaken to find low - mass members , and few candidates have been found ( see randich , schmitt , & prosser 1996 for a discussion ) .",
    "we used the johnson & knuckles ( 1955 ) photometry for  and the mendoza ( 1967 ) photometry for @xmath0 ; we note that the @xmath0 photometry for the cluster stars listed in rsp differs significantly from that in the mendoza 1967 paper and is based on an earlier study by mendoza .",
    "the sample size for the color interval used in the other clusters is small ( 15 stars ) , so we also included 9 additional stars with  from 0.35 to 0.49 and @xmath64 .",
    "a histogram of the distance estimates from the isochrones is shown in figure 16 .",
    "there is a clear peak in the histogram for  at a distance modulus of 4.625 at solar [ fe / h ] .",
    "the hyades ms shape yields a peak at a similar distance of 4.675 , but with a systematic dependence of the distance estimate on color , i.e. the shape of the coma ber and hyades ms are different for the hotter stars .",
    "we therefore adopt the isochrone fit for our distance estimate . correcting for metal abundance",
    "we get a  distance modulus for coma ber of 4.54 ; given the low quoted error in the cluster [ fe / h ] we estimate an error of 0.04 magnitudes . if we were to adopt a larger uncertainty of 0.05 dex in the cluster [ fe / h ] the error in the distance estimates for all of the clusters we have studied would rise to 0.06 mag . the ms fitting distance of 4.54 is a @xmath65 discrepancy with the hipparcos distance if we adopt an error in the ms fitting distance of 0.04 and @xmath66 if we adopt an error in the ms fitting distance of 0.06 .",
    "the behavior of the cluster in @xmath0 , however , is puzzling .",
    "there is no well - defined peak for the cool stars , and the hotter stars concentrate at a distance ( 5.1 ) well above either the  or the hipparcos distance .",
    "this can be traced to the temperature scale for the two colors ; the @xmath0 colors for the cluster f stars imply temperatures significantly hotter than the colors .",
    "the isochrones are brighter at the hotter temperatures , causing higher distance modulus estimates for these stars ( smaller @xmath38 implies larger m - m ) .",
    "we compare the temperatures from the isochrones in the two colors to those obtained by boesgaard ( 1987 ) in a study of lithium in f stars in figure 17 .",
    "boesgaard estimated temperatures from , stromgren photometry , and also measured spectroscopic temperatures ; her temperature scale is in excellent agreement with the  temperature scale in the isochrones and in significant disagreement ( at the 200 - 300 k level ) with the @xmath0 temperature scale for the f stars .",
    "adopting the hotter temperature scale implied by the @xmath0 colors would raise a series of problems : the lithium dip in coma would be at hotter @xmath56 than for other clusters , it disagrees with spectroscopic temperature estimates and those from stromgren photometry , and large internal variations in the derived iron abundances for cluster stars would result .",
    "we have no explanation for this problem , and reobserving the cluster stars in @xmath0 and ir colors would be useful to understand the problem .",
    "we therefore do not use the @xmath0 distance to the system , and our ms fitting distance to this cluster must be taken with this discrepancy in mind .",
    "the cluster is compared to isochrones in both of our colors in figure 18 .",
    "the results of section 3 indicate that it is the hipparcos distance to the pleiades which is in the most serious conflict with ms fitting . in all of the other systems except coma ber , ms fitting in different colors yields distance results that are consistent with one another , normal helium , and [ fe / h ] values from high resolution spectroscopy .",
    "coma ber may have an equally serious disagreement , but the unusual behavior of the cluster in @xmath0 suggests that other problems may be contributing to the discrepancy for it .",
    "we therefore examine in turn the various possible mechanisms that could reconcile the cluster distance scales for the pleiades ; in all cases we believe that they can not do so . in a companion paper",
    "we show that the same conclusions result from an examination of nearby field stars ( soderblom et al .",
    "we then proceed to an analysis of the hipparcos parallaxes for the pleiades , and show that there are indications of possible systematic errors that could be the origin of the discrepancy .",
    "the calculations that we have presented are standard stellar models .",
    "we have therefore not included physical processes such as gravitational settling , rotational mixing , magnetic fields , internal gravity waves , or mass loss , which are surely present .",
    "there are strong reasons for believing that these nonstandard effects will not influence the distance scale , although they could be potentially important for other issues .",
    "the single most important reason is the youth of the clusters that we have examined ; detailed nonstandard calculations predict little , if any , effect for ages as young as the pleiades .",
    "in addition , any such process would have to affect stars with a wide range in masses to a similar extent and be different among different clusters to explain the pattern that we see .",
    "gravitational settling is minimal in young systems such as the pleiades , and the degree to which helium and heavy elements sink depends strongly on the convection zone depth and thus the stellar mass .",
    "for example , helium and heavy element diffusion are a 10% fractional effect in the sun , which is almost 50 times older than the pleiades .",
    "the observed cluster lithium abundances require a mild envelope mixing process , and models with rotational mixing that are consistent with the lithium data predict little or no deep mixing ( pinsonneault 1997 ) .",
    "in addition , the observed range in rotation rates in clusters is large , and any extra mixing would produce a spread in ms properties rather than a uniform shift in the distance estimates .",
    "other physical processes could affect the results , but they are still subject to a variety of observational constraints which make a large effect unlikely .",
    "we have compared different standard model calculations , and the zero - point offset is small ( 0.01 - 0.03 mag for stars between 5600 and 7000 k , for example ) . the systematic errors in the standard model distance estimates",
    "is therefore also too small to explain the results that we have obtained .",
    "we now discuss age , composition , and reddening effects .",
    "it is well - known that many young stars are heavily spotted ; this could influence the color - temperature relationship and therefore the distance estimates for young systems such as the pleiades and @xmath1 per . in figures 1 and 2 we compared these two clusters at the hipparcos distances in our two colors ; the pleiades is clearly anomalous with respect to @xmath1 per if the hipparcos distance scale is adopted . since @xmath1 per is younger and has a larger population of rapid rotators , if anything @xmath1 per should be more anomalous than the pleiades if our ms fitting age estimates were in error because of activity .",
    "we note that similar conclusions can be obtained by comparing young and old field stars ( soderblom et al .",
    "the narrow width of the pleiades ms also indicates that a wide range in stellar activity does not produce a significant effect on the color - temperature relationship .",
    "for all of these reasons we reject the idea that youth is responsible for the difference between the distance estimates .",
    "another possibility is that activity could be influencing the pleiades [ fe / h ] , which has been derived from lte model atmospheres .",
    "if such a phenomenon were at play , it might lead to derived abundances being a function of line strength due to the direct effect of activity on the stronger lines formed at smaller depths in the photosphere .",
    "we have a number of high resolution spectra of pleiades members that was originally obtained to study lithium abundances .",
    "we have analyzed the data in the cool pleiades dwarfs and find no such [ fe / h]-line strength correlation .",
    "this does not exclude such a real correlation , though , given the influence of damping , which is adjusted to enforce such a lack of correlation . to the extent that our damping assumptions seem quite reasonable compared to numerous other fine spectroscopic analyses , and",
    "are consistently applied in both the stellar and solar analyses to yield line - by - line [ fe / h ] values , the analysis suggests any such trends are not substantial .",
    "regardless , any systematic error in the inferred mean [ fe / h ] is greatly mitigated by the fact that the damping adjustments enforce consistency with the weaker lines , which are formed at deeper depths , and thus presumably are more immune from the direct effects of chromospheric activity .",
    "activity in very young stars can manifest itself in the form of an effective veiling continuum .",
    "such behavior would presumably weaken the line absorption , thus leading to _ underestimated _ line strengths and , hence , abundances .",
    "detailed nlte line formation calculations to determine how the active pleiades dwarfs fe and other metal abundances might be affected by activity , spots , convective flows , _ etc .",
    "_ would be of interest , but are unlikely to produce large errors for the reasons discussed above .",
    "homogeneous fe abundances are available for the pleiades , praesepe , and @xmath1 per from the work of boesgaard and collaborators .",
    "independent modern fine analyses of these clusters ( and a few others ) by other investigators are available for comparison with their work .",
    "all the studies considered here derive self - consistent solar fe abundances with which the stellar values are normalized .",

    "boesgaard ( 1989 ) determined a `` best '' pleiades abundance by analyzing new data for 8 pleiads ; the result was [ fe / h]@xmath69 .",
    "boesgaard & friel ( 1990 ) used new data for 12 of the same stars in boesgaard _",

    "the single datum standard deviation in all these studies is @xmath70 dex .",

    "the @xmath73 dex offset between the cayrel and boesgaard values is representative of uncertainties in reddening ( which enters via photometric @xmath74 determinations by boesgaard ) , the @xmath74 determinations ( the cayrel values are based on h@xmath1 profiles ) , and other details .",
    "the cayrel result is consistent with eggen s ( 1986 ) inference from narrow band photometry that the pleiades [ fe / h ] is near the hyades value    in order to increase the sample of pleiades stars with [ fe / h ] determinations , some of us ( king _ et al . _",
    "1997 ) have used high quality keck spectra of two slowly rotating very cool ( @xmath75 k ) pleiades dwarfs to derive fe abundances .",

    "the mean abundance is [ fe / h]@xmath76 , with estimated errors in the mean of perhaps 0.05 dex .",
    "while comparison of the different studies indicates there may be systematic errors at the 0.1 dex level , we regard this ( dis)agreement to be quite satisfactory given the @xmath77 k range in @xmath74 , the disparate sources of data , and distinct methods used to derive @xmath74 . while a slightly sub - solar fe abundance is often assumed for the pleiades based on the boesgaard & friel results , the totality of the high - resolution spectroscopic evidence may be more consistent with a slightly super - solar value ; our photometric [ fe / h ] is consistent with solar [ fe / h ] . therefore , if anything the data suggest a distance modulus estimate larger than our ms fitting value rather than smaller .",

    "these are small compared to the offset needed to explain the hipparcos - based m@xmath87 values for the pleiades . barring fundamental failure or incompleteness in our understanding of spectral line formation and stellar atmospheres",

    "we might caution , however , that the abundances of other important atmospheric opacity contributors ( _ e.g. , mg and si _ ) are , unfortunately , unknown .",
    "there are other factors that make a large error in the pleiades [ fe / h ] unlikely .",
    "colors that incorporate an infrared band are less sensitive to metallicity than .",
    "the figures in the previous section indicate clearly that the shift in the cluster distance modulus is the same for different color indices ; the pleiades must be intrinsically subluminous if the revised distance estimate is correct .",
    "the deviations from the high - resolution [ fe / h ] values for the pleiades are both large and inconsistent from color to color .",

    "carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen can affect stellar structure in ways other elements do not ; are they anomalous in the pleiades ? as part of his thesis , king ( 1993 ) examined the oxygen abundances of stars in several clusters over a broad range of age .",
    "the [ o / h ] for the pleiades was found to be higher than for praesepe ( + 0.29 and + 0.02 respectively , with errors in the mean of 0.08 for both ) .",
    "however , the trustworthiness of abundances ( such as these ) derived from the high excitation 7774  lines is a matter of some debate .",
    "besides possible large data and analysis differences between various studies ( e.g. king & hiltgen 1996 ) , there may be significant abundance corrections due to non - lte effects on line formation in stellar atmospheres ( see garcia lopez et al .",
    "1995 ) . unfortunately ,",
    "systematic errors of 0.3 dex in the cluster o abundances derived from high - excitation lines remains plausible . in any case , the king results would act to make the pleiades more metal - rich and therefore require a higher distance modulus estimate .",
    "detailed abundance studies would be useful , but deviations from the solar mixture would need to be very large to have a significant impact on the luminosity of the ms .      the initial solar helium abundance can be inferred from theoretical solar models by the requirement that the model have the solar luminosity at the age of the sun .",
    "modern evolution codes give estimates for the initial solar @xmath90 in the range @xmath91 ; the best solar models of bahcall , pinsonneault , & wasserburg ( 1995 ) had @xmath92 and @xmath93 with and without gravitational settling respectively .",
    "a comparison of theoretical stellar models with the hipparcos main sequence of the hyades by perryman et al .",

    "this agreement between the sun and hyades was anticipated and reinforces the notion that stars formed in the current epoch have similar helium abundances .",
    "nevertheless , we consider what range of @xmath90 would be needed to drop the pleiades main sequence by 0.3 mag , and that value is about @xmath95 .",
    "such a high value of @xmath90 for the pleiades would imply a drastic revision of chemical evolution models and , by extension , would raise the possibility that other clusters might have similar anomalies .",
    "ms fitting would therefore require knowledge of both the metal and helium abundances ; since helium can only be directly observed in young systems this would make ms fitting unreliable at the 0.3 magnitude level for the majority of clusters .",
    "we believe that this question is best answered by direct measurements of the helium abundance in hii regions and massive stars .",
    "we begin with a discussion of the literature on helium abundances ; we have also obtained data on the relative helium abundances in the pleiades and @xmath1 per .",
    "neither the field star data nor our pleiades spectra are consistent with significant variations in the initial helium abundance from the solar value .    ignoring a deviant few percent of field stars , nissen s ( 1974 )",
    "study revealed no intrinsic scatter in @xmath90 greater than @xmath96% ( compared to the 30 - 40% deviation required by the pleiades stars ) in nearby main - sequence field b stars .",
    "gies & lambert ( 1992 ) found helium abundances consistent with both the sun and the orion nebula for a sample of 35 b dwarfs ; 4 b supergiants in that sample were found to have anomalously high helium abundances .",
    "there is evidence that evolutionary effects are responsible for helium enrichment in the most massive stars ( see maeder & conti 1994 , lyubimkov 1996 , pinsonneault 1997 for reviews ) , so helium abundances from ms o stars and massive supergiants may not be reliable indicators of the initial @xmath90 . the b star field data and the orion nebula abundances are therefore our best test for the range in helium abundance at solar metal abundance , and they are consistent with only small variations in the initial helium abundance .    for galactic clusters , however , the picture is less clear .",
    "shipman & strom ( 1969 ) , peterson & shipman ( 1973 ) , nissen ( 1976 ) , and lyubimkov ( 1977 ) found evidence for 20%-30% variations in @xmath90 among young associations , including some systems with significantly lower @xmath90 .",
    "lyubimkov suggested an increasing he abundance with _ increasing _ age amongst the young clusters / associations studied , a conclusion not supported by the subsequent field star work of gies & lambert .",
    "patton ( 1979 ) determined he abundances of 60 stars in 8 young clusters and associations .",
    "she noted that her initial abundances displayed a range in @xmath90 of about 25% , and that this could not be explained by the the usual error sources ; she also called attention to a correspondence between he abundance and cluster age .",
    "however , patton shows that binarity may be responsible for observed cluster - to - cluster he abundance dispersions , and the notably low he abundances ( observed by others too ) seen for a few stars within a given cluster / association . eliminating",
    "_ suspected _ ( but not positively identified ) binary systems from her analysis results in cluster he abundances which are identical to within the uncertainties .",
    "this highlights the need for secure knowledge of very fundamental stellar parameters ( e.g. , binarity ) before reliable he abundances can be derived .    with this muddled picture of main sequence",
    "stellar he abundances , one may wonder if the pleiades he abundance could be abnormal . both the pleiades and @xmath1 per are young enough to have b stars , and their helium can be directly measured .",
    "the @xmath90 values from lyubimkov ( 1977 ) agree to within @xmath97 , which is well within the uncertainties ; the pleiades and @xmath1 per @xmath90 value is 0.04 larger than the corresponding field star value , but the uncertainties are comparable to this offset .",
    "klochkova & panchuk ( 1986 ) also derived b - star he abundances in both the pleiades and @xmath1 per .",
    "they claim to find no difference between the mean abundances that is larger than the uncertainties .",
    "however , this conclusion is not clear to us from the abundances listed in their table ii , which do demonstrate quite a very large difference .",
    "unfortunately , only two pleiades stars are included in the analysis .",
    "therefore small number statistics and the possible effects of binarity make assessment of this difference quite difficult .",
    "we attempted a final comparison using the `` field '' stars from nissen ( 1974 ) .",
    "this sample includes four @xmath1 per stars , and two stars ( hr 5191 and 7121 ) which are suggested members of the purported pleiades supercluster .",
    "the mean @xmath90 value is only 0.03 larger for the pleiades field stars than for the @xmath1 per stars ; the uncertainties are probably not much smaller than this difference .    to investigate the possibility of a non - standard helium abundance in the pleiades fischer & king ( 1998 ) observed ms b stars in @xmath1 per and pleiades to differentially compare the helium abundances .",
    "preliminary analysis of the lines strengths for six he lines suggests that the cluster he abundances are identical within an uncertainty of 15% .",
    "any real difference appears to be in the opposite sense of what is needed to make the pleiades underluminous : the pleiades line strengths are , if anything , consistently smaller than the @xmath1 per counterparts .",
    "reddening will tend to make a cluster ms fainter at a given color .",
    "if the reddening is increased the inferred distance modulus will therefore increase .",
    "the effect can be roughly estimated as follows : in the color interval that we are using for ms fitting the derivative of @xmath38 with respect to both  and @xmath0 is @xmath315 .",
    "the extinction @xmath40=3.12@xmath39 and @xmath98=1.5@xmath39 . adding these effects together",
    "an increase in @xmath39 of 0.10 magnitudes would increase v at fixed  and fixed @xmath0 by 0.188 ( 0.5 mag from a shift of 0.1 in  - 0.312 mag from extinction ) and 0.438 ( 0.75 mag from a shift of 0.15 in @xmath0 - 0.312 mag from extinction ) magnitudes respectively .",
    "the relative distances inferred by the two colors can therefore be affected if the reddening is incorrect .",
    "in addition the [ fe / h ] abundances derived for cluster stars are sensitive to t@xmath99 , and an increased reddening would imply a higher [ fe / h ] for a given equivalent width ( therefore further increasing the distance modulus ) .",
    "other colors , such as @xmath100 , will be less reddening - sensitive .",
    "neither the hyades nor praesepe show any evidence for reddening along the line of sight ; increasing the reddening estimate for the pleiades would worsen the discrepancy with the hipparcos distance modulus estimate . even changing @xmath39 from 0.04 to 0",
    "would only decrease the distance modulus by 0.08 magnitudes .",
    "the reddening estimates for the pleiades have been derived for a wide range of masses and from different techniques ; crawford and barnes used stromgren photometry to estimate @xmath40 for b , a , and early f stars in the pleiades and praesepe , prosser and stauffer used m dwarfs in the same clusters , and breger used polarization measurements in the pleiades .",
    "we conclude that reddening is not a significant source of uncertainty in distance estimates for the pleiades .",
    "multicolor distance measurements of the type performed in this paper could be a useful check on the reddening for more heavily obscured systems .",
    "another possibility is that systematic errors in the photometry could cause errors in the distance estimates . for the color range that we are considering , the slope of the ms is @xmath315 ; this would require a systematic error of 0.06 magnitudes in  to reconcile the pleiades distance scales , which is unreasonably large .",
    "the size of the systematic errors can be constrained by comparing spectroscopic temperature estimates with those based upon colors . in the case of coma ber , for example",
    ", it appears that spectroscopic temperature estimates are in agreement with the  colors of f stars but not with the @xmath0 colors .",
    "we note that the slope of the ms in @xmath0 is steeper for f stars than for the cooler stars , and that systematic errors in the @xmath0 photometry might explain the puzzling behavior of coma ber .",
    "we have attempted whenever possible to rely upon a single source for photometry in a given color for a given cluster . even in the case of the @xmath0 data we see no evidence of systematic differences between the location on the color magnitude diagram of stars with colors converted to the cousins system from the kron system and those converted to the cousins system from the johnson system .    for the pleiades , independent studies ( section 2.2 )",
    "give consistent photometry for individual stars at the level of the quoted errors ( 0.01 - 0.02 mag ) .",
    "the 0.3 mag discrepancy between the hipparcos and ms fitting distance distance modulii is much too large to be explained by systematic errors in the photometry .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopy of the pleiades is consistent with the observed colors , and the reddening is small . for systems with higher reddening ,",
    "however , care must be taken when converting between different photometric systems ; the johnson , cousins , and kron system i bands have different effective central wavelengths and therefore different reddening corrections .",
    "the final possibility is that the hipparcos pleiades parallaxes may contain previously undetected systematic errors .",
    "if the ms fitting result @xmath101 does indeed give the correct pleiades distance , then a systematic zero - point error would need to approach the 1 mas level to produce the discordance with the hipparcos results .",
    "such an error seems impossibly large , in view of the extensive tests ( arenou et al .",
    "1995 , 1997 ) demonstrating the global zero - point error of the hipparcos parallaxes to be smaller than 0.1 mas",
    ". however , global tests have little power to reveal effects occurring on the small angular scale ( @xmath102 ) of the hipparcos spatial correlations ( see below ) . indeed ,",
    "the hipparcos parallaxes of stars in open clusters such as the pleiades represent the first real opportunity to test for systematic effects on small angular scales .",
    "one might well argue that it would only be prudent to consider the hipparcos cluster results as the first direct tests for small - scale zero - point errors , rather than as cluster distance measurements .",
    "the hipparcos pleiades parallax ( van leeuwen & hansen ruiz 1997a ) is based on measurements of 54 cluster members , ranging in @xmath103 from 2.8 to 11.5 within @xmath104 of the cluster center , so it represents a fairly broad sampling of the cluster . because hipparcos observed widely separated ( @xmath105 apart ) star fields simultaneously , the parallaxes are inherently on an absolute scale over the whole sky . over small regions of the sky ( @xmath106 )",
    ", however , the astrometric results are positively correlated because neighboring stars ( within the @xmath107 hipparcos field of view ) tended to be observed on the same great circles the satellite swept out over the sky ( lindegren 1988 , 1989 ) . a comprehensive discussion of the hipparcos mission and data reductions is given in volumes 13 of the hipparcos catalogue ( esa 1997 ) .",
    "the spatial correlations may significantly impact the astrometric results for star clusters , whose angular size is of the same order as the hipparcos correlation scale . to account for this , van leeuwen & hansen ruiz ( 1997a ) re - calculated the pleiades mean parallax from the intermediate hipparcos data .",
    "for this paper , one of us ( r.b.h .",
    ") has re - examined the individual pleiades parallaxes from the hipparcos catalogue .    moreover , besides the spatial correlations , there is a different type of correlation affecting the hipparcos results  the statistical correlations among the five astrometric parameters ( position , proper motion , and parallax ) , arising from the imperfect distribution of hipparcos observations on the sky over time .    in classical parallax work ( cf .",
    "vasilevskis 1975 ) , the time distribution of observations over a star s parallactic ellipse is controlled to maximize the parallax factors and minimize the correlations between position , proper motion , and parallax .",
    "this is easy to achieve from the ground , but hipparcos could not do this because of the limited span of observations and the pattern of scans of the sky , as explained in section 3.2.4 ( pp .",
    "321 - 325 ) of the hipparcos introduction ( esa 1997 , vol .",
    "figures 3.2.42 to 3.2.61 of that work illustrate the patterns of the correlations over the sky ; figure 3.2.66 ( p. 363 ) shows histograms of the 10 correlations .",
    "the rms values are @xmath108 , and large areas of the sky show correlations averaging 0.4 or more in size .",
    "it must be emphasized that these correlations are substantially larger than would be considered acceptable in ground - based parallax observations .    for parallax work ,",
    "the most important correlation is @xmath109 , between parallax and right ascension ( field h20 in the hipparcos catalogue ) .",
    "this is because , over most of the sky , most of the extent of the parallactic ellipse is in right ascension .",
    "the hipparcos @xmath110 correlation is shown in fig .",
    "3.2.44 of the hipparcos introduction .",
    "large values of @xmath110 were caused in certain areas of the sky by the unfortunate circumstance of unequal observations on both sides of the sun , as discussed on p. 325 of the hipparcos introduction .",
    "this happens to impact the pleiades particularly badly .",
    "the mean value of @xmath110 near the pleiades center is + 0.4 ; this is at the 96th percentile in the histogram in fig 3.2.66 .",
    "the question this raises is whether this large correlation , caused by the time distribution of hipparcos observations of the pleiades stars , has any effect on the parallax values .",
    "we stress again that this is a different effect from the spatial correlation that exists because hipparcos astrometric data over small ( @xmath102 ) areas of the sky are not fully independent measurements .    in figure 19",
    "we plot parallax vs. the correlation @xmath110 for 49 pleiades members verified by proper motion , radial velocity , and position in the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "( mermilliod et al s 51 stars and van leeuwen et al s 54 are virtually the same set as these ; we rejected several additional stars on account of problems noted in fields h30 and h59 of the hipparcos catalogue . )",
    "this plot shows several interesting things .",
    "the filled symbols are 12 bright ( @xmath111 ) stars within @xmath102 of the cluster center with correlations @xmath112 ( the mean value for the whole sample ) . due to the spatial correlation effect ,",
    "these 12 stars all have nearly the same parallax ( mean 8.86 mas , rms dispersion 0.45 mas ; @xmath113 too small at the 0.995 significance level ) . because hipparcos errors are smallest for bright stars , these stars carry much of the weight of the pleiades parallax .",
    "there is a clear trend ( slope ) of parallax vs. @xmath110 correlation ; a weighted least - squares solution gives a slope of @xmath114 mas per unit correlation .",
    "the solid line in fig .",
    "19 is this slope , run through the mean point ( + 0.34,+8.53 ) .",
    "the dashed lines show @xmath115 slopes .",
    "the intercept at zero correlation is @xmath116 mas , quite consistent with the ms fitting distance .",
    "figure 20 plots parallax vs. distance from the cluster center .",
    "the filled symbols are the same 12 bright stars with high @xmath110 as in fig .",
    "the open symbols are the 15 stars with @xmath117 , with no restriction on magnitude or distance .",
    "the two sets of stars barely overlap because the brightest stars in the pleiades are highly concentrated to the cluster center .",
    "the low - correlation stars lie farther from the pleiades center and show a much larger parallax scatter , reflecting ( a ) the larger errors for fainter stars and ( b ) the lack of spatial correlations on scales @xmath118 .",
    "moreover , their mean parallax is smaller ( reflecting the slope discussed above ) .",
    "for the 15 stars with @xmath117 , the weighted mean parallax is @xmath119 mas .",
    "the rms dispersion is 1.66 mas , consistent with the published parallax errors .",
    "this exercise is not intended to be a definitive re - determination of the pleiades parallax ; that would require going back to the intermediate hipparcos data as per van leeuwen et al ( 1997 ) , and exploring the effects of both the @xmath110 and the spatial correlations at that level .",
    "however , it is quite clear that ( a ) small - angular - scale systematic effects at the 1 mas level are present in the hipparcos pleiades parallaxes ; ( b ) these effects are related to the high values of the @xmath110 correlation near the cluster center ; ( c ) the bright stars within @xmath120 of the center , which carry most of the weight of the mean parallax , are the most severely affected ; and ( d ) the stars with lower @xmath110 correlations , far enough ( @xmath118 ) from the center to be unaffected by the spatial correlation , have smaller parallaxes , consistent with the ms fitting distance .",
    "we also looked for effects of the @xmath110 correlation in the hyades , praesepe , @xmath1  per , and coma  ber clusters . in figures",
    "2124 we present the parallax vs. correlation plots for those clusters .",
    "the hyades , praesepe , and @xmath1  per clusters also have large values of @xmath110 , but the the slope ( d@xmath121/d@xmath122 ) present in the pleiades data does not occur in these clusters , where the ms fitting distances and the hipparcos distances are in good agreement .",
    "the data for coma  ber do show a slope d@xmath121/d@xmath123 mas , but the range of @xmath110 is small , and the mean is near zero .",
    "the hipparcos distances to the open clusters can be regarded as either a test of the theory of stellar structure and evolution or as a test of the parallaxes themselves .",
    "to distinguish between the two it is necessary to determine what the errors in stellar interiors - based cluster distances are .",
    "we have performed a detailed multicolor analysis of the distances to the nearby open clusters , and verify that ms fitting can be performed to a precision of order 0.05 magnitudes . with the exception of coma ber , distance estimates from  and @xmath0 colors can be used to get photometric [ fe / h ] values accurate at the 0.05 dex level , and these estimates are in good agreement with those obtained from high - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "there is a small zero - point shift , of order 0.04 dex , between our photometric abundance scale and that of friel and boesgaard ; if we adopted our zero - point the distance estimates we have reported would all be increased by 0.04 magnitudes .",
    "we also note that the distances inferred for rapid rotators are not consistent for the two colors ; this implies that color temperatures for these stars may be in error , especially if they are derived from colors .",
    "this may play some role in the lithium - rotation correlation seen in young rapidly rotating stars .",
    "we have shown that the internal consistency of ms fitting is high and , in the particular case of the open clusters , the systematic errors are small .",
    "the basic cluster data ( abundances , reddening , etc . )",
    "are also well established for the systems that we have studied in this paper . the extremely good agreement between helioseismology and theoretical solar models places strong constraints on missing physics in the models , and by extension the properties of solar analogs",
    "should be accurately represented by the models .",
    "for all of these reasons we believe that the open cluster distance scale from ms fitting is on very strong ground .",
    "the hipparcos mission permits a comparison of parallax and ms fitting distances for a number of open clusters . in two of the systems that we have studied ( @xmath1 per and the hyades ) the two distance scales are in very good agreement . in coma and",
    "the pleiades they disagree at the 0.2 and 0.3 magnitude level respectively ; these differences are at the 3.4 and 3.7 @xmath2 level respectively .",
    "the different distance scales for praesepe are either very close ( 0.08 mag ) or discrepant ( 0.33 mag ) depending upon which of the hipparcos distance measurements is adopted ; the latter would be a 2 @xmath2 disagreement .",
    "we have searched for sources of error in the ms fitting distances of coma ber and the pleiades .",
    "the @xmath0 photometry of coma yields a distance that disagrees both with hipparcos and ; this can be traced to a discrepancy in the temperature scales for the two colors in this cluster .",
    "although we believe that there are a number of indications that the  temperature scale is correct ( consistency with spectroscopic temperatures and stromgren photometry , for example ) reobserving this cluster in ir and near - ir colors would be highly desirable to quantify the magnitude of the problem .",
    "in the case of the pleiades there is no such ambiguity ; different colors yield identical distances .",
    "errors in the metal abundance and reddening as a solution can be rejected on a variety of grounds .",
    "the increase in the cluster helium abundance needed to reconcile the distance estimates is large and not consistent with direct measurements .",
    "furthermore , we can find no counterparts of the pleiades in the field , i.e. intrinsically faint solar abundance stars ( soderblom et al .",
    "we are therefore left with the uncomfortable choices of either requiring unknown physics in the interiors models or a problem with the hipparcos parallax distance scale to the pleiades .",
    "the former choice is made even less attractive by the requirement that the models retain agreement with the sun , the other clusters , and numerous other tests of the theory of stellar structure and evolution .",
    "we therefore believe that the latter explanation is more likely .",
    "we have shown that there is evidence in the pleiades data for systematic errors in the parallaxes on small angular scales .",
    "the same trends are not present in the clusters where the two distance scales agree ; they may also be present in the coma ber cluster .",
    "clusters such as the pleiades provide many more stars within a small region of the sky than are present for the sky as a whole , and they are therefore uniquely suited to test systematic effects at small angular scales . the other clusters and",
    "the pleiades show no evidence for systematic errors on scales larger than @xmath124 .",
    "the pleiades results suggest that individual parallax measurements with large @xmath110 correlations should be treated with caution",
    ". the implications of this result for other applications of the hipparcos parallaxes will depend upon the characteristics of the sample . for large samples over large regions of the sky",
    "the net effect will be a modest increase in the overall error . a numerical example : arenou et al .",
    "( 1997 , pp.441 - 443 ) find the overall ratio of hipparcos `` external '' to `` internal '' errors to be 1.06@xmath290.07 from clusters and 1.04@xmath290.04 from distant stars . with the internal error",
