    "the advent of ubiquitous traffic sensing provides unprecedented real - time , high - resolution data that elucidate historical trends and current traffic conditions . however , traditional signal timing approaches have yet to take full advantage of these data @xcite . surveys of practitioners suggest that only sixty percent of the 300,000 signalized intersections in the united states are retimed at intervals less than five years @xcite , and the national transportation operations coalition has given a grade of `` c@xmath0 '' to signal timing practices and a grade of `` f '' to traffic monitoring and data collection in the united states .",
    "these deficiencies contributed to the 6.9 billion hours of additional travel time caused by inefficient traffic management in 2015 @xcite .    increased urbanization demands more efficient use of this transportation infrastructure , which in turn requires full use of measured data . at signalized intersections ,",
    "standard actuated signal timing plans are designed to make limited use of real - time measurements to , _",
    "e.g. _ , extend green time for approaching vehicles or enable actuation phases to be skipped if no waiting vehicles are present @xcite .",
    "however , actuated traffic signal timing only accommodates modest deviations from the nominal traffic conditions and is thus unable to respond to systematic changes in the traffic flow .",
    "this paper proposes a _ traffic predictive control _",
    "strategy for signalized intersections that predicts future traffic flow based on real - time measurements and adjusts the intersection s signal timing accordingly .",
    "the prediction algorithm first identifies trends in historical traffic flow and then uses real - time measurements to determine the degree to which these historical trends are exhibited by the current traffic conditions .",
    "for example , historical trends may indicate that increased flow in one commute direction during the morning correlates with increased flow in the opposite direction in the evening .",
    "traffic predictive control identifies this relationship and uses it to adjust signal timing parameters in the afternoon using measurements of traffic flow in the morning .",
    "the present work thus lies within the extensive literature on traffic prediction and forecasting .",
    "see , for example , @xcite for a survey of the literature .",
    "the majority of the forecasting literature focuses on freeways rather than urban street traffic @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite develop a stochastic traffic flow model for freeways , and it is shown that this model is amenable to kalman filtering techniques to estimate traffic conditions .",
    "kalman filtering is also used in @xcite to estimate traffic flow as the result of a random walk biased by historical increments in measured flow over time . in @xcite , @xmath1-means clustering is used to divide historical data , and an armax prediction is computed for each possible cluster .",
    "the most likely cluster is used to provide a forecast of future traffic flow .",
    "a large body of literature focuses on estimating flows throughout a network using flow measurements and conservation laws .",
    "for example , in @xcite , real - time link flow data is used to predict origin - destination and link flows by modeling a traffic network as a gaussian bayesian network , which provides conditional distributions and probability intervals for link flow . in @xcite , structural deviations from regular traffic patterns , modeled using polynomial trend filters , are used to estimate origin - destination flows .",
    "in contrast to these approaches , we focus on predicting traffic flow at a higher resolution for a single intersection .",
    "a variety of model - based and statistical approaches exist for estimating travel times on arterial roads , which is closely associated with the problem of estimating traffic flows and volumes .",
    "a flow model is combined with gps probe data in @xcite to predict arterial travel times using a bayesian network learning approach .",
    "each link is modeled as being in a state of congestion or undersaturation , and the bayesian network models the transition between these states .",
    "a similar approach is considered in @xcite for using gps probe data to estimate travel time where additional explanatory variables such as speed limits and number of lanes per link are used to reduce the number of parameters in the model . in @xcite , an approach for short - term travel time estimation that fuses past and real - time data",
    "is presented .",
    "these data are weighted based on their quality , which incorporates properties of the data including sensor accuracy and delay .",
    "a queuing theory approach is used to provide probability distributions on queue lengths in traffic networks in @xcite , and the model accounts for finite - capacity queues and captures spatial correlations .",
    "while the above approaches focus on aggregate estimates for larger networks , the focus of this paper is on high - resolution estimates of traffic flow for all movements at a single intersection .    in @xcite ,",
    "aggregate daily traffic flow patterns are studied , and a functional principal component decomposition is used reduce the dimensionality of the data .",
    "this approach is similar to the analysis proposed in section [ sec : princ - comp - analys ] of the present paper , however , @xcite focuses on identifying changes in daily traffic patterns for long term traffic monitoring , whereas , in the present paper , we use a principal component decomposition to lay the foundation for our traffic prediction approach .",
    "moreover , @xcite focuses on freeway networks and not signalized networks .    when prediction is applied to signalized intersections for adaptive control ,",
    "prediction horizons are short , _",
    "e.g. _ , seconds or minutes @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the present work focuses on longer prediction horizons on the order of hours for use in conjunction with more traditional traffic signal timing methods such as pre - defined timing plans .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a principal - component based prediction scheme for signalized intersections using the _ projection to latent structures ( pls ) _ algorithm @xcite .",
    "abstractly , this algorithm decomposes two sets of data to find low - rank , correlated structure between the data sets .",
    "for example , in the case of traffic , suppose the objective is to predict traffic flow from 2 pm to 8 pm using traffic flow measurements up to time 10 am .",
    "first , historical measurements of traffic flow up to 10 am and of traffic flow between 2 pm and 8 pm are collected .",
    "next , the pls algorithm decomposes the data into a set of pairs of _ latent structures _ which provide low - rank approximations of the data sets with the additional requirement that each pair of latent structures is highly correlated .",
    "then , given real - time measurements of traffic flow for a particular day up to 10 am , future traffic from 2 pm to 8 pm is predicted by computing weights for the latent structures .",
    "an important property of this approach is that the proposed traffic predictive control builds on existing standard practices for traffic signal timing .",
    "in particular , we consider the common practice of signal timing based on time - of - day plans which are preprogrammed to apply during certain periods of the day ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 5 ) .",
    "each plan is designed to accommodate a certain level of traffic flow at the intersection . traditionally ,",
    "this level of traffic flow is determined based on averaged historical measurements ; often , these measurements span only a limited time window over several days and may have been collected years ago . critically , averaged historical flow is unable to capture anomalous traffic patterns . in @xcite",
    ", a genetic algorithm selects from among a set of predefined plans based on current conditions .",
    "the primary contribution of this paper is a traffic predictive control scheme that uses a prediction of future traffic flow to adjust the time periods for which the time - of - day plans are active and , additionally , suggests predicted levels of traffic around which the timing plans should be designed .",
    "our approach thus does not depend on the exact algorithm that is used to determine timing plans ( _ i.e. _ , green splits ) from traffic flow , however , in our case study we employ a delay minimization policy . by ensuring that the proposed control approach is well - aligned with existing practices , the proposed controller integrates well with existing traffic control hardware which universally accommodate time - of - day timing plans and are often capable of remote changes to these plans .",
    "additionally , practitioners familiar with standard practices are likely to be more receptive to the proposed traffic predictive control .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : preliminaries ] describes the problem setup , available data , and details of the case study .",
    "section [ sec : princ - comp - analys ] analyzes structural trends in the traffic flow data using a principal component analysis , which establishes the foundation for the prediction algorithm presented in section [ sec : traff - pred - from ] .",
    "section [ sec : traff - pred - contr ] proposes a traffic predictive control scheme that uses predictions of future traffic flow to adjust signal timing plans .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] provides concluding remarks , future directions of research , and plans for implementation .",
    "we first characterize the requirements and assumptions generally and then specialize to a specific test site as our case study throughout the paper .      we consider a single traffic intersection consisting of a set of @xmath2 _ turn movements _ indexed @xmath3 through @xmath2 .",
    "for example , a prototypical intersection consists of four approaches , each approach consisting of a left turn movement , a right turn movement , and a through movement so that @xmath4 , as in the case below .",
    "the flow rate of vehicles along each turn movement is measured and recorded once per interval of time @xmath5 .",
    "thus , @xmath6 measurements of the flow are made per movement per day .",
    "we assume measurements are available for a total of @xmath7 days .    for day @xmath8 and movement @xmath9 ,",
    "let @xmath10 denote the flow rate of vehicles executing the @xmath11-th turn movement on day @xmath12 during time interval @xmath13 in vehicles per hour ( vph ) . from this notation ,",
    "we aggregate the measurements into vectors and matrices as follows : @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes vector transpose . that is , @xmath16 is the vector of flow measurements along the @xmath11-th movement on day @xmath12 and @xmath17 is the vector of flow measurements along all @xmath2 movements on day @xmath12 .",
    "we define the aggregated data measurement matrix as @xmath18 typically , @xmath19 so that @xmath20 is a wide matrix .",
    "table [ tab : notation ] contains a summary of the notation .",
    "we consider measured turn movements to represent the exogenous demand on the system from the external environment .",
    "in particular , it is assumed that measured turn movements are negligibly affected by the choice of control action :    [ assum : exo ] turn movement flows originate from an exogenous process and , in particular , are not influenced by the choice of control actions at the intersection .    for this assumption to be reasonable , we must have the sampling period @xmath5 long enough so that the impact of the control signal is negligible ( _ e.g. _ , if @xmath5 is 5 minutes and the cycle time of the signal actuation at the intersection is 2 minutes , then a measurement @xmath10 may include between two and three periods of actuation for movement @xmath11 .",
    "thus , @xmath5 is too short since @xmath21 will exhibit undesired oscillations caused by the control signal ) .",
    "empirical evidence suggests that @xmath22 minutes is reasonable for minimizing such effects .",
    "additionally , implicit in assumption [ assum : exo ] is that vehicles do not reroute in response to changes in signal actuation .",
    "the test site presented below is a large intersection for which few alternative routes exist .",
    "thus , the assumption that vehicles do not reroute is reasonable for our study .",
    ".summary of notation . [ cols= \"",
    "> , < , < , > \" , ]",
    "we have proposed a traffic predictive control scheme that identifies trends in historical traffic flow data and uses real - time measurements to predict future traffic flow . these trends manifest as low - rank structure in the data which are identified using decomposition techniques akin to principal component analysis and particularly suited for prediction . using a rich dataset of traffic flow measurements over the course of eight months",
    ", we provide evidence that much of the day - to - day variation in traffic flow consists of these low - rank , latent structures .",
    "the traffic predictive control adjusts the time periods and parameters for time - of - day traffic signal scheduling based on predictions of traffic flow using real - time measurements .",
    "this scheme is particularly well - suited for implementation on existing traffic control hardware , which universally support time - of - day plans and often are capable of remote updating of signal timing parameters .",
    "furthermore , this approach is well - aligned with standard signal timing practices , increasing the likelihood of successful adoption by practitioners .",
    "additionally , the traffic predictive control requires minimal tuning and accommodates any green split optimization scheme that requires expected traffic flow as input .",
    "the savings in delay for the case study intersection is found to be 7.8 veh@xmath23hr per day . valuing a driver s time at $ 20 per hour and conservatively assuming that each vehicle carries only one occupant , this suggests annual savings of around $ 57000 .",
    "in addition , this metric is compared to a well - timed but pre - specified controller that does not account for real - time measurements ; the savings are likely to be higher for intersections that are currently poorly timed . if these calculations are even only approximately correct , the savings are likely to be well worth the relatively small implementation costs .",
    "an important future direction of research is to consider the case of an arterial corridor . in this case , a straightforward extension of the proposed approach is to consider all movements along the corridor in aggregate .",
    "however , there is high correlation between the traffic flows for some sets of movements as vehicles progress along the corridor .",
    "this suggests an approach that explicitly accounts for these spatial correlations as is done in @xcite .",
    "additionally , future research will investigate confidence bounds on the predictions .",
    "for example , can low - rank structure be used to predict the 90th or the 99th percentile traffic flow ? furthermore , traffic prediction from historical trends captures phenomena that have occurred previously in the historical data , and thus may not be well - suited for events that are truly one - off events such as lane closures due to construction . however",
    ", it may be that lane closures in one direction over an interval of time affects traffic in a similar manner as lane closures on a different leg at a different time .",
    "learning these more universal trends is another future direction of research .",
    "finally , these questions will be pursued alongside an implementation pilot planned in collaboration with sensys networks , inc .",
