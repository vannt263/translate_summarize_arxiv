    "the studies related to plasma response at fast electron time scales are becoming a topic of considerable research interest lately .",
    "the topics of laser plasma interaction @xcite , reconnection in electron current layers @xcite , fast z pinches @xcite , fast plasma based switching devices @xcite and also fast ignition physics @xcite primarily involve a study of plasma phenomena occuring at electron response regime @xcite .",
    "one particular simplified fluid model description characterizing the electron dynamics against the background stationary charge neutralizing ions is the electron magnetohydrodynamics ( emhd ) @xcite .",
    "the model has so far been primarily studied in the context of plasma with uniform homogeneous density . in realistic situations",
    ", however , the plasma typically has an inhomogeneous density .",
    "the role of density inhomogeneity was outlined briefly earlier in a paper by kingsep @xcite .",
    "the paper , however , discussed the effect in the absence of any electron inertia related terms . in the present manuscript the emhd model has been generalized for the case of a plasma with inhomogeneous density profile including effects associated with finite electron inertia .",
    "the governing equations for the generalized emhd are shown to reduce to two coupled scalar field evolution in the 2-d limit .",
    "for homogeneous density these equations reduce to the well known form studied extensively earlier @xcite .",
    "the emhd equations for the homogeneous plasma permits a variety of coherent localized solutions which are of a stationary monopolar form or a travelling ( with constant velocity ) dipolar form @xcite .",
    "these solutions are extremely robust and have been observed to form spontaneuosly in simulations @xcite . here , we study the propagation and evolution of such coherent solutions when they encounter an inhomogeneous plasma .",
    "this is done by employing our generalized emhd ( g - emhd ) equations for the numerical evolution of these solutions specified as an initial condition .    in the next section",
    "we outline the details of the derivation of the governing equations for the g - emhd model corresponding to the spatially inhomogeneous plasma density .",
    "the 2-d limit of the equation is then obtained and it is shown that the governing equations are a coupled evolution equation for two scalar fields .",
    "these scalar fields represent the component of the magnetic field and the vector potential along the symmetry direction . in section iii",
    "we briefly recapitulate the coherent solutions of the emhd equations and their well known propagation characteristics in the context of a homogeneous plasma . the physical similarity of the dipole structure to a forward moving current pulse accompanied by spatially separated reverse shielding currents is also shown in this section . in section",
    "iv we then show with the help of our numerical simulations how the density inhomogeneity influences the propagation of these structures .",
    "the restrictions on total grid points constrains us to consider a ratio of maximum to minimum plasma density in our simulation domain to be at most a factor of @xmath0 only .",
    "this constraint arises from the need of adequately resolving the plasma skin depth scales in the high density regime . in section",
    "v we present a novel observation illustrating the trapping of dipolar emhd structures in the high density plasma region . the consequence of this novel observation on the physics of fast ignition is also pointed out . finally , in section vi we summarize the salient points of the paper .",
    "in this section we obtain the governing equations for describing dynamical phenomena occuring at fast electron time scales in the presence of plasma density inhomogeneity .",
    "the time scales are fast such that the ion response can be ignored .",
    "however , it is considered to be slower compared to the minimum value of the local plasma frequency @xmath1 and/or @xmath2 ( here @xmath3 is the electron gyrofrequency ) whichever is smaller .",
    "this ensures that the displacement current can be ignored and hence electron density fluctuations are considered to be negligible .",
    "this essentially implies that the electron continuity equation drops out from the evolution .",
    "thus the system of equations which we derive here can be looked upon as the generalized electron magnetohydrodynamics ( g - emhd ) model for inhomogeneous plasma .",
    "the curl of electron momentum equation can be written as @xmath4 \\label{curl_emom}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 .",
    "the electron velocity @xmath6 from the ampere s law , as the displacement current can be ignored and ions being stationary the current is determined by the electron flow velocity alone .",
    "also , here @xmath7 and @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote magnetic vector potential , magnetic field vector and the plasma density respectively .",
    "we choose to normalize the electron density with the minimum value of the plasma density @xmath10 in the region of interest , and the length by the corresponding skin depth @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) corresponding to this density .",
    "the magnetic field is normalized by @xmath13 , the typical magnitude of the magnetic field and the time by the corresponding electron gyrofrequency @xmath14 .",
    "the normalized equation can then be written as @xmath15 \\label{ncurl_emom1}\\ ] ] @xmath16 equation([ncurl_emom1],[ncurl_emom2 ] ) represents the g - emhd model written in normalized fields and variables .    for the case",
    "when the variations of the fields are confined in two dimensional @xmath17 plane , the g - emhd model ( eq.([ncurl_emom1],[ncurl_emom2 ] ) can be represented by a coupled set of evolution equations for two scalar fields @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "these two scalar fields define the magnetic field of the system through the following relationship : @xmath20 thus @xmath18 represents the magnetic field component along the symmetry direction @xmath21 and the magnetic field along @xmath22 and @xmath23 directions are @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "the normalized electron velocity , the expression for @xmath26 , etc .",
    ", in terms of these two scalar fields can then be written as @xmath27   + \\nabla \\left(\\frac{1}{n } \\right ) \\times   \\left[\\hat{z } \\times \\nabla b - \\nabla^2 \\psi \\hat{z } \\right ] -   \\left[b \\hat{z } + \\hat{z } \\times \\nabla \\psi \\right ] \\label{vgfld}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equations ( [ ncurl_emom1],[ncurl_emom2 ] ) ( which describe the evolution of @xmath28 ) may be separated in terms of components @xmath29 and @xmath30 from which we may derive the following coupled set of evolution equations for @xmath18 and @xmath19 fields .",
    "@xmath31   + \\hat{z } \\times \\nabla \\psi \\cdot \\nabla \\left ( \\frac{\\nabla^2 \\psi}{n}\\right ) = 0   \\label{2db}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath32 equations([2db],[2dpsi ] ) represent the generalized emhd equations in two dimensions .",
    "when the plasma density @xmath33 is a constant , the above coupled set of equations reduce to the emhd equations in 2-d .",
    "the sum of magnetic and the kinetic energy of the system is given by the expression @xmath34 dx dy\\ ] ] and is an invariant for the above coupled set of g - emhd equations .",
    "however , when the in plane component of the magnetic field is zero , i.e. when @xmath35 , an additional square invariant @xmath36 ^ 2   dx dy\\ ] ] also exists for the system . note that for the homogeneous case @xmath37 represents the enstrophy ( space integral of mean square vorticity ) , which is the second invariant for the system .",
    "in the subsequent sections we will discuss the results of the numerical simulation of eqs.([2db],[2dpsi ] ) for several distinct choices of plasma inhomogeneity . equations ( [ 2db ] ) and ( [ 2dpsi ] ) are evolved for the generalized vorticities @xmath38 and @xmath39 using the flux corrected algorithm developed by boris _ et . al _ @xcite .",
    "( here @xmath40 and @xmath41 are used to denote the operators , which upon operating on @xmath18 and @xmath19 produce @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively . )",
    "the value of the @xmath18 and @xmath19 at each time step are then extracted from the generalized vorticities @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively by constructing matrices corresponding to the inverse operators @xmath44 and @xmath45 for the chosen spatial inhomogeneity of the plasma density .",
    "it should be noticed here that the dimension of this matrix being extremely large ( @xmath46 , where @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 represent the number of grid points along @xmath22 and @xmath23 directions respectively ) it puts a severe constraint on the resolution . to adequately resolve the skin depth at the maximum plasma density and to simultaneously also have the box dimension longer than several electron skin depths ( corresponding to the minimum value of plasma density ) we were constrained to choose the ratio of maximum to minimum plasma density to be at most a factor of @xmath0 only .",
    "alternatively , to achieve higher resolutions a relaxation algorithm to evaluate @xmath50 and @xmath51 , needs to be implemented @xcite which utilizes the standard solvers for helmholtz equation where the ram requirements would not be so extensive .",
    "we are in the process of implementing this for our future studies on g - emhd model .",
    "the g - emhd equations ( eqs.([2db],[2dpsi ] ) ) reduce to the following form for a homogeneous density @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath53 = [ \\psi , \\omega_{\\psi } ]   \\label{2db_h}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath54 = 0   \\label{2dpsi_h}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the uniform plasma density has been chosen for the density normalization .",
    "the symbol @xmath55 $ ] used in the equations represents a poisson bracket between the field @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "it is then clearly evident from the above equations that for the homogeneous system all radially symmetric ( monopolar ) structures are exact stationary solutions of the equations .",
    "furthermore , it has been observed that monopolar structures localized within a spatial extent of electron skin depth are fairly robust and stable and they are spontaneously created during simulations with arbitrary initial configurations .",
    "a collection of monopoles which are spatially separated by a distance larger than the electron skin depth also constitute a stationary configuration of the above set of equation .",
    "this is so as in this case the self term of the poisson bracket vanishes on account of radial symmetry and the cross term between two structures vanishes as there is no spatial overlap amidst them .",
    "it is then interesting to see how these structures behave in the presence of density inhomogeneity .",
    "this is explored by us by numerically simulating the evolution of these structures in a given inhomogeneous density profile .",
    "the results of such studies are presented in the next section .    the other interesting class of solutions permitted by eqs.([2db_h],[2dpsi_h ] )",
    "have dipolar form @xcite .",
    "these solutions are not stationary but have a steady translational velocity with respect to the static ion frame of the emhd model .",
    "the dipolar solutions can be obtained by seeking stationarity in a moving frame @xmath58 ( assuming the translational velocity to be along the @xmath23 coordinate ) .",
    "equation([2dpsi_h ] ) can then be written as the vanishing of the poisson bracket @xmath59 = 0 $ ] .",
    "this implies that @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is a function of @xmath62 . using this expression for @xmath43 as well as the stationarity criteria in the @xmath63 frame , eq.([2db_h ] ) can be expressed as @xmath64 = 0;\\ ] ] here @xmath65 indicates a differential with respect to the argument @xmath66 of the function @xmath61 .",
    "this suggests that @xmath67 ( @xmath68 being another function of @xmath62 ) .",
    "thus a travelling solution can be obtained by seeking solutions of the following coupled set : @xmath69 the general solutions would correspond to any choice of the functions @xmath68 and @xmath61 . however , analytical form of the dipole solutions are typically obtained by choosing the vorticity source functions @xmath68 and @xmath61 as linear functions of their argument @xmath70 in the inner spatial region of radii @xmath71 around the centre of the structure .",
    "the differential equation can be separated in @xmath72 and @xmath73 coordinates in the two dimensional @xmath74 plane .",
    "it can be shown that an explicit appearance of @xmath75 ( as a coefficient of @xmath76 ) produces a @xmath77 dependence and hence a dipolar form of the solution .",
    "furthermore for the radial part in this inner region , the solutions can be represented in terms of a bessel function of the first kind denoted by @xmath78 . to achieve localization the vorticity source functions @xmath68 and @xmath61",
    "are chosen to be zero in the outer spatial region @xmath79 .",
    "the solutions for the fields @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the outer region are thus modified bessel function @xmath80 of the radial coordinate .",
    "the matching of the field and its derivative in the inner and outer region yields a localized solution .",
    "it might appear that the specific linear choice made for the inner region is too restrictive and may in general not correspond to reality .",
    "however , it has been shown recently ( for the system with @xmath35 ) that a linear choice of @xmath68 is consistent with a self organization paradigm based on the enstrophy minimization subject to the constancy of the energy of the system @xcite .",
    "the approach of the system to such a self organized state has been confirmed by numerical simulations which show the spontaneous formations of structures from an arbitrary initial condition satisfying eq.([dipole ] ) for a linear functional form of @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "similar studies in the presence of finite @xmath19 field are underway and the results will be reported elsewhere . in the present manuscript",
    "we report the propagation characteristics of the dipolar solutions for both cases ( viz . @xmath35 and @xmath19 finite , with @xmath68 and @xmath61 both as linear functions of the argument @xmath62 ) as they encounter the inhomogeneous plasma density profile .    it should be noted that a monopolar structure is like a circularly rotating current similar to that of a solenoid .",
    "the propagating dipoles on the other hand can be viewed as an electron current pulse translating in space .",
    "the central spatial region within the positive and the negative peaks of the magnetic structure carries electron current in the direction of the propagation of the dipole , whereas the outer edge region carries a reverse current as shown in the schematic plot of fig.1 .",
    "thus the dipole structure can be viewed as a current pulse containing a spatially separated forward and the reverse shielding electron current pulse .",
    "the current configuration of a dipole is thus quite similar to the one encountered during the ignition phase of the fast ignition experiments .",
    "the forward energetic electrons generated at the critical density surface moves towards the dense target core .",
    "the background plasma in this case provides for the return shielding current .",
    "the two currents get spatially separated through weibel instability and form current channels in which the inner region carries the forward current and the outer region the return shielding current .",
    "the numerical study of the propagation of the dipole magnetic structure through an inhomogeneous plasma and its behaviour in the high density region is therefore an important issue for investigation . in the subsequent sections",
    "the result of such a simulation will be presented .",
    "in this section we study the propagation of both monopolar and dipolar solutions through an inhomogeneous plasma .",
    "the plasma density inhomogeneity is chosen to have the following spatial profile @xmath81 the parameters @xmath82 and @xmath18 were chosen appropriately to define either a density hump in the region @xmath83 or a density cavity .",
    "for the above chosen density profile the constant density contours form straight lines parallel to the @xmath22 axis .",
    "the monopolar structures are the exact stationary equilibrium solutions of the homogeneous emhd equations . in order to study the influence of plasma inhomogeneity on their evolution we place a monopolar structure initially at the boundary region ( around @xmath84 ) , where the plasma density inhomogeneity is typically high .",
    "the subplots of the fig.2 show the evolution of this structure . for this case",
    "we had chosen the simulation box of size @xmath85 and @xmath22 and @xmath23 coordinates range from @xmath86 to @xmath87 .",
    "for the plasma density we had chosen @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the maximum and minimum value of density is therefore @xmath92 and @xmath93 respectively .",
    "the local electron skin depth therefore ranges from @xmath94 .",
    "the high density plasma region here is confined within @xmath95 for all @xmath22 .",
    "the density falls sharply within a length @xmath96 from @xmath0 to unity beyond @xmath97 .",
    "the density scale length at the boundary is typically of the order of the electron skin depth as @xmath91 .    from the figure it is clear that the monopolar structure moves transverse to the density gradient .",
    "the monopoles being stationary in the homogeneous plasma the propagation velocity is clearly an artifact of the presence of plasma density inhomogeneity .",
    "the direction as well as the magnitude of the propagation velocity is observed to match with the following drift velocity . @xmath98 which can be obtained from the eq.([2db ] ) upon ignoring electron inertia related terms . for the density profile of eq.([profilea ] ) @xmath33 is a function of @xmath23 alone and we have the propagation along @xmath22 and the magnitude of the velocity is @xmath99 from the subplots of the fig.2 , the value of @xmath100 evaluated by observing the distance propagated by the structure along @xmath22 is @xmath101 which is close to that estimated from the above expression for the electron drift velocity , as @xmath18 typically ranges from @xmath102 to @xmath103 in the monopolar structure and @xmath104 ranges from @xmath105 to @xmath106 over the structure .",
    "this implies that the value of @xmath100 from the expression can be about @xmath107 to @xmath108 .",
    "the observed value lies within this range .",
    "in fact the average of @xmath100 evaluated over the @xmath23 extent of the structure ( through which the structure would translate ) turns out to be very close @xmath109 to the observed velocity .",
    "this clearly indicates that the monopole is essentially propagating with the drift velocity of @xmath110 .",
    "the other density gradient dependent terms arising through the finite electron inertia related terms are typically smaller in magnitude and they generally contribute as a source causing modification of the spatial profile of the magnetic structure .",
    "we next study the behaviour of dipoles as they encounter the region of plasma density inhomogeneity .",
    "since the dipolar structures are known to propagate along their axis , we start our simulation by placing an exact nonlinear dipole structure at some distance away from the density gradient region , i.e. at a location of a uniform low density plasma where @xmath111 at a positive @xmath112 .",
    "the sign of the lobes in this case are chosen in such a way that the dipole propagates towards the high density region .",
    "we observe that the dipolar structure crosses past the inhomogeneous density region to enter the high plasma density region .",
    "the subplots of fig.3 clearly illustrate the penetration of the dipolar structure in the high density plasma region .",
    "( for the plots of this figure we again have @xmath113 , @xmath89 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "the box length in this case is @xmath116 . ) in fact we observe that at the inhomogeneous density region the axial translational velocity of the dipole increases considerably .",
    "the two lobes get squeezed towards each other forming a shock like structure in the direction transverse to the density gradient .",
    "this behaviour appears to be in stark contrast to the propagation characteristics of the monopolar structures , which merely show a movement transverse to the density gradient direction .",
    "the observations on dipole propagation can , however , be understood readily . for the dipole structure approaching the high density plasma region ( along decreasing @xmath23 , in fig.3 )",
    "the left lobe corresponds to positive values of @xmath18 whereas the right lobe has negative @xmath18 values .",
    "clearly , when the two lobes of the dipole encounter the density inhomogeneity the left lobe has a drift velocity due to the density inhomogeneity towards right ( positive @xmath22 direction ) whereas the right one drifts towards the negative @xmath22 direction .",
    "this sqeezes the two lobes of the dipoles closer in @xmath22 . as a result",
    "the size of the lobes as well as their separation gets significantly reduced .",
    "this also causes an enhancement in the magnitude of @xmath117 of the two lobes .",
    "the reduced distance between the lobes as well as the enhanced amplitude of @xmath117 results in an increased axial propagation velocity of the dipole .",
    "this accelerates the penetration of the dipolar structure in the high density plasma region .",
    "it should be noted that for the case where the dipole approaches a density cavity the effect is entirely different .",
    "the sign of @xmath118 being opposite , in this case the lobes separate with the drift speed .",
    "the separation results in a reduced axial velocity of the dipole , which ultimately dimishes to zero as the separation distance between the two lobes exceeds the electron skin depth distance .",
    "the two lobes then separately move as monopolar structures transverse to the density gradient direction .",
    "thus , the dipole is unable to penetrate the region of lower plasma density .",
    "our simulations indeed show this effect as the subplots of fig.4 clearly illustrate . here",
    "the central region @xmath119 corresponds to a low density plasma region with @xmath120 .",
    "here @xmath121 , @xmath122 and other parameters are same as that of fig.3 .",
    "let us now study in detail the behaviour of the dipole as it enters the high density plasma region . though the shape of the dipole is considerably distorted while it traverses the inhomogeneous plasma region , but once it is inside the high density homogeneous plasma region it regains the familiar dipolar form .",
    "the scale length of the dipole , in the high density region changes by the same factor as the ratio of the skin depth of the high and low density regions .",
    "for instance the initial dipole was chosen to have @xmath123 and at @xmath124 when it is completely inside the high density region the value of @xmath125 ( a reduction by a factor of approximately @xmath126 ) .",
    "we thus observe that the dipolar structures are fairly robust . even after encountering a strong density inhomogeneity , once in the region of homogeneous plasma",
    "they adjust smoothly to the new value of the density .    in the next section",
    "we illustrate an interesting consequence of the above observations , namely that of novel trapping behaviour of emhd dipoles in a high density plasma region .",
    "the propagation characteristics of the dipolar structure discussed in the preceding section has an interesting consequence .",
    "it suggests that the emhd magnetic structures of dipolar form can enter a high density plasma region .",
    "however , once inside a high density plasma region they would remain trapped there .",
    "we choose a density profile @xmath127 which has a high density region with a finite transverse extent as well .",
    "a circular region in the @xmath17 plane is chosen to have a high density of the plasma .",
    "the functional form of the plasma density is @xmath128 the choice of parameters for simulation with this density profile is @xmath129 . for this particular density profile a dipole",
    "is placed with its centre on the line @xmath130 at the positive value of @xmath131 .",
    "the axis of the dipole is parallel to the @xmath23 axis as can be seen from the subplot at @xmath132 of fig.5 .",
    "the dipole velocity is directed along the negative @xmath23 axis so that it approaches the high density plasma region .",
    "it can be seen from the subsequent subplots that due to the individual density inhomogeneity related drift velocity of the two lobes , the two lobes of the dipole approach each other .",
    "this enhances the axial dipolar velocity and the dipole structure enters the high density region .",
    "once inside the homogeneous high density region it translates along its axis which is along the diameter of the circular high density region . upon reaching the other end",
    "the dipole again encounters the inhomogeneous plasma density region .",
    "however , the direction of the density gradient is now opposite to the one that it encountered while entering the high density region .",
    "thus in this region the two lobes of the dipole separate from each other . as the separation between the lobes exceeds the skin depth distance the lobes act like individual monopolar structures and move transverse to the density gradient . in this case",
    "the density gradient being along the radial direction , the two structures move along the perimeter of the circle .",
    "they thus again come in close contact at the topmost point of the circle from where they had entered the high density region . at this place they again form a dipolar structure and translate along the diameter of the high density region .",
    "the simulations clearly show the repetition of this cycle .",
    "it is thus clear that the dipole structure remains trapped inside the high density plasma region .",
    "these numerical results showing penetration of the dipolar structures inside the high density region and its trapping within the high density region suggests an important implication for the problem of fast ignition @xcite . in this scheme one",
    "relies on energetic electrons generated at the critical density surface by the ignitor laser pulse to penetrate the high density pre - compressed target core and deposit its energy there for the creation of hot spot . here",
    ", we have shown that a current pulse in the form of a dipolar structure ( similar in form to a forward moving electron current and a spatially separated reverse shielding current ) can easily penetrate a high density plasma region .",
    "it has also been observed that once inside the compressed target the structure is unable to come out of the compressed high density region .",
    "this suggests that there will be ample time for them to dump their energy in the high density compressed region of the core of the fusion target plasma .",
    "another interesting thing to note is the fact that as the dipole enters the high density region the squeezing of its lobes results in a shock formation along the direction transverse to the density gradient .",
    "such a shock formation is an artifact of the thermoelectric like source term @xmath133 in the magnetic field evolution equation where the self consistent magnetic field @xmath134 , itself acts as a pressure term .",
    "this nonlinearity is responsible for the shock formation .",
    "the sheared current layer in the magnetic shock structure would lead to the kelvin helmholtz ( kh ) like instability @xcite .",
    "the instability converts the electron flow energy into fine scale vortices . in the three dimensional case such vortex flows cascade energy towards finer scales @xcite and",
    "eventually dissipate into heat by electron landau damping effects .",
    "we would show through simulations as well as analytical modelling in a subsequent publication that the shoch width adjusts in such a fashion that the energy dissipation in such a shock structure is essentially independent of the value of the dissipation mechanism .",
    "this again is very important in the context of fast ignition scheme as it suggests that the energy dissipation would occur no matter how small is the value of the classical collisional damping process in the dense target core .",
    "furthermore , in some recent fast ignition experiments it has been observed that if a metallic wire is attached to the gold cone where the ignitor laser pulse is incident , the energetic electrons generated at the critical density surface choose a preferential path provided by the ionized wire to traverse from the low density plasma corona towards the compressed target core @xcite .",
    "this result is important as it indicates that the energetic electrons can be guided in the low density plasma corona region to reach the dense target core .",
    "an understanding of this pheneomena has , however , been lacking .",
    "we feel that this can again be understood on the basis of the novel trapping mechanism outlined above .",
    "the ionized wire in this case forms a high density plasma path amidst the low density coronal plasma .",
    "the high density region can then trap the current pulse structure formed by the combination of the forward energetic electrons and the background reverse shielding current .",
    "a generalized electron magnetohydrodynamic ( g - emhd ) model has been introduced here which accounts for the fluid model description of fast electron time scale phenomena in an inhomogeneous plasma .",
    "the electron density fluctuations have , however , been ignored by restricting to times scales which are slower than electron plasma period @xmath135 and/or @xmath136 whichever is smaller .",
    "this is the same condition which is invoked for the derivation of the emhd model and justfies ignoring the displacement current . a reduced g - emhd model for 2-d case has also been obtained .",
    "the model is represented in terms of a coupled set of evolution equation for two scalar fields .",
    "the two scalar fields correspond to the component of the magnetic field and the vector potential along the symmetry direction .",
    "the g - emhd equations in 2-d were used to study numerically the evolution and propagation of nonlinear coherent solutions of the emhd equations in the presence of density inhomogeneity .",
    "the two varieties of coherent solutions ( viz . , the stationary monopolar solutions and the travelling dipolar solutions ) show interesting novel aspect of propagation as they encounter a region of plasma density inhomogeneity .",
    "the monopolar structures are no longer stationary but are observed to propagate with a diamagnetic drift velocity .",
    "the dipoles on the other hand display a very novel behaviour .",
    "they show penetration inside the high density plasma region from a lower density side . however , once inside the higher density region they get trapped inside this region . it has been shown that this behaviour of trapping can have interesting favourable implications in the context of the energetic electron propagation and their stopping inside the dense target core in the context of fast ignition experiments .",
