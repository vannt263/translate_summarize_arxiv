    "spin precession measurements on atoms , molecules or solid state samples are susceptible to noise from magnetic field fluctuations . for measurements performed close to the surface of conductors ,",
    "the magnetic johnson noise caused by thermal fluctuation of electrons in the conductor @xcite can contribute significantly to the uncertainty of the measurement .",
    "this effect is a known challenge in atom chip experiments @xcite and precision magnetometry @xcite .",
    "magnetic johnson noise is also becoming a challenge for experiments that measure the electron s electric dipole moment ( edm ) @xcite .",
    "measurements of the electron edm are typically carried out in neutral atoms or molecules @xcite using some form of electron spin precession .",
    "limitations associated with magnetic noise in edm experiments can be avoided by choosing neutral system with a small magnetic moment and/or a large sensitivity to the size of edm @xcite . even using a favorable system",
    ", magnetic johnson noise must be minimised through careful choice of the materials placed close to the atoms or molecules .",
    "this paper describes a simple , low cost set of electric field plates which will be used for an improved measurement of the electron edm using the ybf molecule @xcite .",
    "the ybf experiment measures the phase difference between zeeman sublevels of the molecule in an applied electric field @xmath1 ( which defines the @xmath2-axis ) and an applied magnetic field @xmath3 .",
    "the phase shift @xmath4 of a level has an electric part @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the electron s edm and @xmath7 is the effective electric field interacting with the edm , and @xmath8 is the duration of the interaction .",
    "there is also a magnetic part @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the magnetic moment ( in our case the bohr magneton ) and @xmath11 is the magnetic field component parallel to @xmath1 .",
    "details of the experiment are given in @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath6 should ideally be limited by the shot noise associated with the number of ybf molecules detected , but @xmath4 also has noise due to the fluctuations of @xmath11 . in order to benefit from current improvements that lengthen @xmath8 and increase the number of detected molecules",
    ", it is now becoming important to reduce the magnetic noise , which is dominated by the johnson noise due to current fluctuations in the electric field plates @xcite .",
    "let the time - dependent noise in @xmath11 be @xmath12 . we relate this to the corresponding spectral density of the noise power , @xmath13 ,",
    "by the wiener - khintchine relation @xmath14 the rms phase uncertainty after interaction time @xmath8 is @xmath15 as noted in @xcite , we can use eq .",
    "( [ eq : wktheorem ] ) to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : phaseerreq ] ) in the form @xmath16 eqation ( 38 ) of varpula and poutanen @xcite provides a formula for @xmath17 at distance @xmath2 from an infinite slab of conducting material at temperature @xmath18 , having thickness @xmath19 and resistivity @xmath20 . in reality",
    "the molecule passes between two electric field plates , each contributing to the magnetic field noise , so we multiply eq.(38 ) of @xcite by a factor of @xmath21 : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a complicated expression given in eq.(39 ) of @xcite .",
    "the @xmath24 variable encodes the frequency dependence of the magnetic field noise via fourier integrals .    the last generation of the ybf eedm experiment @xcite used aluminium electric field plates ( @xmath25 m ) of thickness @xmath26  mm .",
    "the gap between the plates was 12 mm , so the distance from the molecules to the surface was @xmath27 mm . at that distance , the magnetic noise spectrum given by eq.([eq : bnz ] ) is plotted as the top ( blue ) line in fig .",
    "[ fig : bnzplot ] .",
    "the noise tends to a constant at low frequency , given by @xcite @xmath28 the integrand in eq.([eq : mungerd ] ) also involves the function @xmath29 , shown ( green , middle ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : bnzplot ] . here",
    "@xmath30  ms as that was the interaction time in the experiment .",
    "after squaring and multiplying these two functions , numerical integration of eq.([eq : mungerd ] ) gives the phase noise as @xmath31  mrad .",
    "this causes an uncertainty in the electron edm of @xmath32 e.cm for a single measurement over coherence time @xmath33  ms in an electric field of 8.3 kv / cm .",
    "averaging over a data run of @xmath34 measurements the corresponding johnson noise in @xmath6 is @xmath35 e.cm . while this was negligible in the previous version of the experiment , that is no longer the case @xcite ,",
    "so we have designed new plates with a much lower johnson noise",

    "equation ( [ eq : bnzf0 ] ) suggests four ways to reduce the magnetic noise : reduce @xmath18 , increase @xmath2 , increase @xmath20 , and reduce @xmath19 .",
    "the temperature does not offer a significant improvement unless the plates could be cooled far below liquid nitrogen temperature , and this does not seem practical in a molecular beam apparatus . larger plate spacing is also not a very useful option for the ybf as it would be challenging to maintain the required high electric field .",
    "with a view to increasing @xmath20 , we have built field plates from commercial ito coated glass ( pilkington k glass ) , which has good vacuum properties and is transparent to visible light .",
    "we find that the coating is prone to discharge , particularly at the edges .",
    "this problem was also reported by @xcite , who tried to mitigate it by custom coating ito over rounded edges .",
    "also , the surface is very easily damaged by discharges .",
    "it has also been proposed that one might use soda glass , heated to a temperature of 150@xmath44c to achieve enough conductivity @xcite , but the addition of plate heaters is a complication we prefer to avoid in the ybf experiment .",
    "our approach has therefore been to reduce @xmath19 , which we have done by making the electrodes from gold - coated polyimide ( kapton ) tape @xcite , on which the gold layer is only @xmath43  nm thick .",
    "this is roughly @xmath45 of the previous plate thickness , while the @xmath46 m resistivity of gold is only slightly less than that of aluminium .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : bnzf0 ] ) suggest that this will reduce the magnetic field noise by approximately 100 , and numerical integration of eq.([eq : bnz ] ) shows this to be the case , as plotted by the red dashed line in fig.[fig : bnzplot ] . the corresponding phase uncertainty , given by eq.([eq : mungerd ] ) ,",
    "is @xmath47rad for a 1  ms measurement in the ybf experiment , which converts to an uncertainty in the electron edm of @xmath48  e.cm over a data run of @xmath34 measurements .",
    "this is sufficiently small that the new ybf experiment will not be limited by magnetic noise from the new plates .",
    "we note that the magnetic noise from the glass substrates is negligible @xcite .",
    "photograph and cross section of the film - on - glass electric field plates . ]    these new , thin , field plates are built on slabs of float glass , with dimensions @xmath49  mm , chamfered on the edges at 45@xmath50 by a few mm , and rounded by hand using silicon carbide abrasive paper .",
    "these are cleaned using detergent and water , then rinsed in distilled water followed by isopropanol .",
    "a cold - roll laminator applies a continuous length of the self - adhesive , gold - coated polyimide tape to the front face of each plate , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : plates](a ) .",
    "excess tape is then folded over onto all four sides of the glass , as illustrated in cross - section in fig .",
    "[ fig : plates](b ) .",
    "when viewed in daylight the surface shows a ripple with a period of a few millimetres , but on measuring the height variations on a flat bed we found less than @xmath51 m peak - to - peak over a @xmath52  mm - square region and no perceptible ripple .    on the top side , viewed in fig.[fig : plates](a )",
    ", the tape is folded over to the back , where it is cut to form a small tab of @xmath53 mm , with its long axis parallel to the top edge of the substrate .",
    "an aluminium block , shown in fig.[fig : plates](a ) , is glued over this tab using conducting epoxy , and is tapped to accept the threaded 2-mm end of a vacuum - compatible high - voltage cable .",
    "the exposed edges of the gold - coated tape discharge at high voltage , but this is suppressed when we cover them with uncoated self - adhesive kapton tape . the four short corners are covered with a small quantity of _ torr seal _ vacuum epoxy to avoid any awkward edges .    inside the vacuum chamber ,",
    "the plates are mounted vertically along the beam line .",
    "each plate is held by two horizontal alumina rods , glued with structural epoxy @xcite to the back face at the top and the bottom .",
    "these plug into two aluminium support plates , where precisely machined holes set the plate separation .",
    "the length of the leakage path from the gold conductor to the grounded aluminium support structure is 21 mm .    once assembled and placed in the vacuum chamber ,",
    "the entire apparatus is baked at 80@xmath44c for three days to accelerate the outgassing .",
    "after cooling to room temperature , the pressure in the vacuum chamber falls to @xmath54 mbar , which is also the base pressure of the chamber without the plates .",
    "we conclude that the outgassing rate from the tape with its acrylic adhesive is below @xmath0 mbar.l / s .",
    "next , the plates are conditioned to support a large potential difference by applying a voltage and switching its polarity with about a one minute period .",
    "we monitor the leakage current using na - sensitive leakage monitors @xcite and raise the voltage in 100v steps until current spikes of @xmath55  na start to appear . then the voltage is held constant ( while continuing to switch the polarity ) until the spikes disappear .",
    "this takes between a few minutes and a few hours , after which the voltage can be further increased .",
    "if the leakage current becomes continuous at greater than 10na the voltage is reduced for a time .",
    "if large leakage currents ( @xmath56a ) are observed the voltage is reduced to zero and conditioning starts afresh . unlike the ito coating , the gold suffered no perceptible damage from these discharges , perhaps because the gold has much higher conductivity , both electrical and thermal .    with this procedure ,",
    "we reach a voltage of @xmath57kv after several days of conditioning .",
    "the leakage current from the plates and high voltage cabling is @xmath58 na , which is dominated by leakage in the external 10m - long coaxial connecting cables and high voltage switching equipment .",
    "the leakage current from the plates and high voltage connections under vacuum is less than 200 pa .",

    "it is important in the edm experiment that the molecules experience a homogeneous electric field between the plates @xcite .",
    "we have mapped the field between the new plates at 4kv / cm , using the molecules themselves to sense the field strength through the stark effect of the hyperfine structure @xcite .",
    "the triangular data points ( red online ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : separation ] show the fractional variation of the field as a function of position along the length of the plates .",
    "this is within the range @xmath59 , which provides a sufficiently uniform stark shift for the edm experiment . for comparison",
    ", we also show the fractional field variation measured between the old plates , which is very similar in magnitude .",
    "rotation of the electric field direction can also be undesirable when it induces a berry phase @xcite , but the variation we measure here occurs over a long distances and that implies a small rotation angle that is insufficient to produce a significant systematic error in the edm experiment .",
    "it would also have been been possible to apply the gold layer by vacuum deposition , but the tape is considerably cheaper and allows field plates of any length to be produced .",
    "it is also straightforward to replace the tape in - house if it were to become damaged by electrical discharge or surface contamination .",
