    "the discovery of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropies ( smoot et al .",
    "1992 ; wright et al . 1992 ) immediately prompted the question of their origin .",
    "in most cosmological scenarios temperature anisotropies are expected to arise with the growth of matter density perturbations ( peebles 1980 ) ; but it was also suggested ( hogan 1992 ) that the anisotropies could have been originated by inverse compton scattering from hot diffuse clouds of electrons in nearby superclusters ( see birkinshaw 1999 for a review on the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ) . right after hogan s suggestion , boughn & jahoda ( 1993 ) and bennett et al .",
    "( 1993 ) searched for non cosmological signal contributions to the cobe / dmr 2 year sky maps .",
    "if the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) component is significant at some level and the distribution of hot electrons is traced by rich clusters or any other extragalactic source , then temperature anisotropies should be correlated with maps constructed from extragalactic source surveys .",
    "banday et al .",
    "( 1996 ) performed this analysis for the cobe / dmr 4 year map .",
    "their study did not find a statistically significant contribution , reassuring the idea that temperature anisotropies were of cosmological origin .",
    "similar cross - correlation analysis have been carried out by several authors to estimate the rms level of the galactic emission present in different cmb maps ( kogut et al .",
    "1996 ; kneissl et al . 1997 ; de oliveira - costa et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "in this article we study the contribution of nearby structures on the temperature anisotropies measured by the tenerife map ( gutirrez et al .",
    "two effects associated with the local matter distribution can give rise to anisotropies in the cmb : the non - linear evolution of gravitational structures ( rees & sciama 1968 ) and the mentioned sz effect .",
    "the latter is expected to give the largest contribution , and we shall center our analysis on it .",
    "since clusters are known to posses ionized gas at temperatures about @xmath3k they are expected to give the largest contribution to the sz effect .",
    "cocoons of radio galaxies ( yamada , sugiyama & silk 1999 ) or other foreground sources subtend a very small angle and , due to beam dilution , have a very small contribution at the scales probed by the tenerife experiment . therefore , we shall look for correlations between the tenerife cmb data and template maps generated from cluster catalogues ; in particular , we use the aco ( abell , corwin & olowin 1989 ) , and rosat pspc catalogues ( vikhlinin et al .",
    "1998 ) . to test the hypothesis that the cmb signal is generated by hot diffuse gas distributed on supercluster scales",
    "we also include a supercluster catalogue ( einasto et al . 1994 ) in our analysis .",
    "finally , we also constructed template maps from the heao 1 a-1 map of x - ray sources ( kowalski et al .",
    "1984 ) that should trace the distribution of hot electrons . in sec .",
    "2 we describe the statistical methods used for comparing data on temperature anisotropies with template maps constructed from different surveys . in sec .",
    "3 we describe the catalogues used and how the template maps were elaborated . finally , in sec .",
    "4 we present and discuss our main results .",
    "at any given frequency , the cmb anisotropy map can be considered a superposition of contributions of cosmological origin , @xmath4 , astrophysical origin , @xmath5 , and instrument noise ,",
    "@xmath6 : @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 is a conversion factor -to be determined- that gives the amplitude of the contribution of foreground sources to the cmb temperature anisotropies . as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", the spatial distribution of clusters should trace that of the electrons . from cluster catalogues",
    "we shall construct template maps of the temperature anisotropies induced on the cmb spectrum by the hot gas traced by clusters .",
    "we shall name template map the term @xmath5 .",
    "let us remark that we do not have a map of the distribution of gas on the nearby universe .",
    "our hypothesis that clusters trace the gas distribution means that we expect the autocorrelation function of the template map to be rather similar to that of the hot gas even though we ignore the exact gas distribution . therefore , and unlike de oliveira - costa et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , our analysis shall be based on comparing correlation functions and not the maps themselves .",
    "assuming that the contribution of foreground sources is uncorrelated with the cosmological signal and noise in the temperature anisotropy map , then the cross correlation of the cmb and the template maps @xmath9 is related with the template map autocorrelation function @xmath10 as : @xmath11 .",
    "a best - fit value of @xmath8 is obtained by minimizing ( banday et al . 1996 ) @xmath12 m^{-1}_{ij } [ c_{tm}(\\theta_j)-\\alpha c_{mm}(\\theta_j)].\\ ] ] in this expression @xmath13 is the covariance matrix of the cross - correlation functions ( ganga et al .",
    "1993 ) defined as follows : @xmath14 [ c(\\theta_j)- < c(\\theta_j)>]>$ ] , with @xmath15 two arbitrary angular separations in the sky .",
    "@xmath16 is the cross correlation of the template map and one single realization of the observed sky .",
    "realizations of the sky were performed in two different ways : ( a ) at each measured temperature we add a random realization of a gaussian distributed noise with zero mean and the variance at that point .",
    "( b ) we performed monte carlo cmb simulations of the tenerife data drawn from a gaussian distribution with variance @xmath17 at each multipole , normalized to @xmath18k .",
    "we assumed a harrison - zeldovich power spectrum for the primordial fluctuations since , together with the previous normalization , is a good approximation at the scales probed by the tenerife experiment ( gutirrez et al .",
    "2000 ) . to each point in the cmb map we add a realization of the noise as in ( a ) . in both cases , the average @xmath19 was obtained from a thousand realizations .",
    "the minimum - variance estimate is : @xmath20 with formal error @xmath21    the approach ( a ) described above does not include sample variance .",
    "we estimated the associated error bar by performing a thousand monte carlo realizations of the cmb sky and finding @xmath8 from the correlation with the template maps .",
    "as expected , the average value of @xmath8 was zero .",
    "the dispersion around this mean , @xmath22 , is a measure of both cosmic variance and the variance coming from random alignments . on the other hand ,",
    "the approach ( b ) includes all contributions to the variance in the estimate of @xmath23 .",
    "the results of the tenerife cmb experiments are presented in gutirrez et al .",
    "the observations were performed in two frequencies : 10 and 15 ghz covering 5000 and 6500 square degrees , respectively .",
    "the experiments are sensitive to multipoles @xmath24 which corresponds to the sachs - wolfe plateau of the radiation power spectrum .",
    "the experiment measures strips in right ascension separated by @xmath25 in declination .",
    "the 15ghz map is made of 8 strips that spans a region on the sky from 8h to 18h in r.a . and from @xmath26 to @xmath27 in dec .",
    "the 10ghz is slightly smaller with only 5 strips running from @xmath28 up to @xmath29 .",
    "the map is in the north galactic hemisphere and has a galactic latitude @xmath30 .",
    "the experiment uses a double - differencing technique to measure , with a @xmath1 fwhm beam , points separated @xmath31 in r.a . for 15ghz , the band power of the cmb signal is @xmath32k , including a possible contaminating effect due to the diffuse galactic component .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "temperature anisotropy at @xmath1 is @xmath33k . at 15ghz , @xmath34k .",
    "the sensitivity at 10 and 15 ghz was @xmath35k and @xmath36k , respectively , in a beam - size region .    as explained in the previous section",
    ", we assume that clusters trace the spatial distribution of the hot gas .",
    "cluster surveys select members according to a given criteria . therefore , different catalogues have different selection biases . for each catalogue we shall elaborate a template map to compare with the tenerife cmb data .",
    "let us briefly describe the ones that will be used .",
    "the aco all - sky catalogue contains 4073 rich clusters of galaxies , each having at least 30 members within magnitude range @xmath37 to @xmath38 ( @xmath37 is the magnitude of the third brightest cluster member ) and each with redshift less than 0.2 .",
    "the heao 1 a-1 catalogue is essentially a catalogue of aco clusters with x - ray emission in the energy range @xmath39kev . for several nearby clusters",
    "the sz effect has been measured ( birkinshaw 1998 ) .",
    "therefore , this catalogue traces the extragalactic objects known to be sources of sz . in this respect , it will be interesting to compare the results obtained by cross - correlating each of these templates with the tenerife map . by including clusters that do not contribute significantly to the sz effect , we could have diluted the signature of the hot gas in the cross - correlation between the aco template and tenerife .",
    "rosat is a catalogue of x - ray selected objects .",
    "it includes from poor groups till rich clusters of galaxies .",
    "these clusters were serendipitously detected in the rosat pspc high galactic latitude pointed observations ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the satellite covers a large energy range ( @xmath41kev ) in the soft x - ray band .",
    "the cluster redshifts range from @xmath42 to @xmath43 in the area of the sky covered by tenerife .",
    "the heao 1 a-1 and rosat catalogues are less sensitive than optical catalogues to projection effects and could detect `` failed clusters '' were galaxy formation was suppressed .",
    "the tenerife experiment operates on the rayleigh - jeans regime and the effect of the hot electrons is to produce a decrement on the radiation temperature .",
    "therefore , if the experiment has detected any contribution from hot gas , cold spots in the data and the template maps should be correlated .",
    "the anisotropy depends linearly on the central electron temperature , cluster core radius and electron density : @xmath44 ( zeldovich & sunyaev 1969 ) .",
    "the exact relation depends on the cluster density profile but this is of no significance since clusters are unresolved by the antenna .",
    "the parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 scale with the cluster mass ( bower 1997 ) . to elaborate a template map",
    "we assume that not only clusters trace the gas distribution but also that the cluster richness is a measure of the cluster mass , and , consequently , of its size , gas content and electron temperature .",
    "we only had information on the richness of aco and heao 1 a-1 clusters . for them",
    ", we constructed a template map by assigning a number to each pixel : zero if there was no cluster , and a contribution proportional to the richness @xmath47 if there was a cluster .",
    "since we did not know how to scale the cluster size , gas density and electron temperature with richness class we tried exponentiating the richness class to three different powers : @xmath48 .",
    "finally , this pixel map was convolved with the tenerife window function . to avoid boundary effects",
    ", we included objects within @xmath49 of the region probed by tenerife .",
    "like in bennett et al .",
    "( 1993 ) we found no significative effect : while for the aco clusters larger @xmath50 led to diminishing the cross - correlation and consequently the value of @xmath8 , for the heao 1 a-1 catalogue , the opposite effect was observed .",
    "however , in all cases the effect was minute and well within the error bars .",
    "we shall quote our results for @xmath51 , when all clusters contribute equally to the sz effect .",
    "the template map of the rosat catalogue was constructed in a similar manner but without scaling with richness class .",
    "finally , we also included in our analysis the supercluster catalogue of einasto et al .",
    "this catalogue was elaborated from the distribution of rich clusters of galaxies up to redshift @xmath52 , extracted from the aco catalogue described above . for each supercluster , the number of cluster members , center position , average distance @xmath53 , extent in supergalactic coordinates and length @xmath54 in mpc are given . in our analysis , twenty two superclusters with typical angular sizes between 5 and @xmath55 were included .",
    "contrary to clusters , superclusters can not be considered point - like . therefore , different hypothesis about the gas distribution could lead to different results . as a first approximation",
    ", we took the gas distributed homogeneously on a sphere of size @xmath56 .",
    "this template is very convenient in order to check hogan ( 1992 ) hypothesis about the local origin of temperature anisotropies .",
    "we called this template `` superclusters with homogeneous gas distribution '' .",
    "we checked that the correlation level did not depend on the gas distribution by chosing a model with a density profile : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a fiducial radius .",
    "we called this template `` superclusters with concentrated gas '' .",
    "finally , both templates were convolved with the tenerife beam pattern before performing the correlation analysis .",
    "table 1 summarizes the results of our analysis .",
    "after substracting the mean and normalizing the templates to unit variance , the autocorrelations and cross correlations were computed given equal weight to each pixel .",
    "we tried different angular bins , from 1@xmath59 to 5@xmath59 , and computed the correlation function out to @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "no significant differences were found . in table 1 , the results are quoted for correlation functions in bins of @xmath62 out to @xmath63 .",
    "the sz effect will generate approximately equal and negative contributions at 10 and 15ghz .",
    "if the signal detected is real one should expect equal and positive values of @xmath8 at the two frequencies . in table 1",
    "we give @xmath23 , @xmath64 as given by eqs .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) and ( [ salpha ] ) , and @xmath65 per degree of freedom ( dof ) in the two approaches described in sec .",
    "2 . for simplicity , we termed ( a ) `` without sample variance '' and ( b ) `` with sample variance '' . in the case",
    "( a ) , we also give the error associated with sampling variance @xmath22 , which should be added in quadrature with @xmath64 .",
    "as the maps were normalized to unit variance , @xmath66 gives the sz component of the cmb map in thermodynamic units .",
    "for each template we calculate the cross - correlation with the 15ghz and 10ghz maps .",
    "since the latter covers a smaller fraction of the sky , we also correlate a reduced 15ghz map ( denoted by 15c in the table ) cut to the size of the 10ghz map to eliminate the bias introduced by the different sky coverage .",
    "no significative detections ( larger than @xmath67 ) were found by either of the two methods .",
    "we always found negative values of @xmath8 , i.e. , cold spots in the template map correlate with hot spots in the data , contrary to what one would expect if there was a significant sz contribution .",
    "the largest signal was obtained at the 15c rosat template map .",
    "since the amplitude of the sz effect does not change much at the tenerife frequencies , consistency would require a fluctuation of the same order to be present at 10ghz .",
    "furthermore , when sample variance was not included in the covariance matrix , the best - fit was never a good fit .",
    "only when it was included @xmath68 became of order unity .",
    "the low quality of the fit can be understood by looking at figure 1 , where we plot the autocorrelation of the template maps ( fig 1a ) and their cross correlation with the data on 15ghz ( fig 1b ) .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the autocorrelation and cross correlation of the aco catalogue , the long dashed line to the heao 1 a-1 catalogue , the dot - dashed line to the rosat catalogue .",
    "thick and thin solid lines correspond to superclusters with uniform and concentrated gas , respectively .",
    "while the autocorrelation functions are rather similar in all cases , the cross - correlation differ substantially in shape .",
    "when the sample variance is not included in the covariance matrix , @xmath64 is small and the difference in shape implies a large @xmath68 .",
    "only when sample variances are included , the error bars are much larger and the fit to the data improves . to conclude , we can only set upper limits on the value of @xmath8 .",
    "taking the results on 15ghz , we limit @xmath69 at the 99% confidence level .",
    "for an experiment with such a beam width like tenerife , one could not expect to find a large correlation between data and templates .",
    "for example , some clusters in the aco catalogue have been found to produce temperature fluctuations of the order @xmath70k ( birkinshaw 1999 ) .",
    "but they subtend an angular scale of few arcminutes and as a result the sz signal is diluted by the large solid angle covered by the tenerife beam .",
    "still , the tenerife data limits the contribution of nearby clusters and superclusters to be smaller than @xmath71k at 99% confidence level .",
    "the mean comptonization parameter at @xmath72 at the same level of confidence .",
    "our results are slightly more restrictive than those previously found by banday et al .",
    "let us remark that @xmath73 obtained above only limits the contribution due to nearby superclusters , while the cobe result of mather et al .",
    "( 1994 ) applies to the contribution of all structures located between the last scattering surface and the observer . to conclude , this study , like previous ones based on the cobe / dmr data , indicate that most of the signal measured by tenerife is not of extragalactic origin but cosmological .",
