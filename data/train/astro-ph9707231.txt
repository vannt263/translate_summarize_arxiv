    "the study of galaxies in rich clusters at earlier epochs has long been seen as one of the best routes to understanding the role of environment in the evolution of galaxy populations , as well as more general issues of galaxy formation .",
    "for this reason a number of groups have studied the photometric and spectroscopic properties of galaxies in distant clusters ( e.g.  butcher & oemler 1978 , 1984 ; couch & sharples 1987 ; dressler & gunn 1992 ; aragn - salamanca et al .",
    "1993 ; barger et al .",
    "one of the most interesting conclusions of these studies has been the realisation that the luminous elliptical population which dominates local cluster cores ( dressler 1980 ) has been in place for a considerable time , at least prior to @xmath5 ( smail et al .  1997a ; ellis et al .",
    "1997 ) and possibly earlier than @xmath6 ( faber et al .  1997 ; lubin et al .",
    "all indications are that this population has undergone only passive evolution in the recent past ( van dokkum & franx 1996 ; ellis et al .",
    "1997 ; barger et al .",
    "in contrast to the relative stability of the elliptical population , the other major component of the local cluster population , s0 galaxies , are claimed to be relatively rare in distant clusters ( dressler et al .",
    "the recent formation or transformation of this population and the nature of the process responsible for it are therefore of considerable interest for understanding the extent of environmental influences on galaxy morphology .",
    "the most dramatic evidence for evolutionary change in the cluster population , however , is seen in the blue galaxy populations of these regions ( butcher & oemler 1978 , 1984 ; couch & sharples 1987 ; dressler & gunn 1992 ) . butcher & oemler s extensive study of a heterogenous sample of distant clusters indicated a substantial increase in the blue populations of rich clusters at @xmath7 .",
    "recent hst work on these systems has shown that these objects are mainly disk galaxies , some of which are interacting ( couch et al .",
    "1994 , 1997a , 1997b ; dressler et al .  1994 ; smail et al .",
    "the absence of this population from similar environments in local clusters may connect with the large present - day population of s0s in these regions .",
    "mechanisms proposed for removing or transforming these star - forming galaxies from the centres of clusters include ram - pressure stripping from the icm ( gunn & gott 1972 ) , tidal effects due to the cluster potential ( byrd & valtonen 1990 ) and interactions with other cluster galaxies ( moore et al .",
    "1996 ) . to date , however , few well - defined samples of distant clusters have been available to test the different correlations predicted by these mechanisms ( c.f .  the @xmath8@xmath9 relation shown by edge & stewart ( 1991 ) or the mass@xmath9 relation of smail et al .",
    "such samples are also necessary to link the observations at different redshifts , by providing an understanding of the parallel evolution of the structures which the galaxies inhabit .    here",
    "we describe a statistical analysis of the galaxy populations in a large , well - defined sample of 10 distant clusters at @xmath100.3 , selected on the basis of their x - ray emission .",
    "our sample focuses on the highest @xmath8 systems , from this we hope to understand the variation in the properties of massive clusters across a relatively narrow mass range , and the effects this has had on the galaxy populations in such regions . in particular , we will concentrate on the variation in the star - formation histories of the luminous elliptical populations between clusters , as determined from their uv  optical colours .",
    "this is a technique previously only applied to small samples of 23 clusters ( bower , lucey & ellis 1992 , ble ; ellis et al .",
    "1997 ) , here we can compare a homogeneous sample of 10 clusters imaged in identical conditions to robustly determine the cluster to cluster scatter .",
    "in particular , we illustrate how our combination of @xmath0 imaging is particularly useful for searching for the signature of recent star - formation in more quiescent systems .",
    "we show the advantages of working in the restframe mid ",
    "uv for detecting even small traces of past activity in certain populations ( dorman et al .",
    "we also study the blue populations of these clusters , using the large positive k correction in @xmath11 for these galaxies to identify them relative to the passive cluster galaxies .",
    "we focus on the varying proportion of this blue , star - forming population in the clusters and the dependence of this component on the global properties of the clusters .",
    "our final aim is to understand the relationships between the various galactic components of the clusters within the framework of a simple model for their growth and evolution .",
    "this study is particularly timely given recent theoretical work in this area ( bower 1991 ; moore et al .  1996 ; baugh et al .  1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "the integration of spectral evolution models with simple dynamical models for structure formation , allow us for the first time to begin to compare theory and observations in this field ( e.g.  baugh et al .",
    "detailed n - body simulations are also now well placed to follow the dynamical evolution of galaxies within cluster potentials ( e.g.  moore et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "it is these types of quantitative comparisons which will benefit from the well - defined cluster sample we use .",
    "this paper is thus part of an on - going program to map out the properties of the galaxy populations in the most massive collapsed structures in the universe as a function of epoch out to @xmath12 .",
    "the data described here deals with the statistical analysis of the galaxy populations in luminous x - ray clusters in the range @xmath13 .",
    "a similar study using very wide field ccd imaging and spectroscopy of a sample of luminous x - ray clusters at @xmath14 is underway ( ohely et al . , in prep ) , this will provide continuous coverage of the evolution of the most massive clusters and their galaxy populations from @xmath150.3 .",
    "previous work linking the galaxy population of distant clusters with their global characteristics has concentrated on the blue , star - forming or `` butcher - oemler '' galaxies in distant clusters ( lea & henry 1988 ) and has found little evidence relating their characteristics to the x - ray properties of the clusters ( although see wang & ulmer 1997 ) . nevertheless , there is still much discussion of the role of a cluster s x - ray - emitting gas in effecting the properties of its galaxy populations .",
    "we note , however , that the necessity for such processes to power the butcher - oemler effect is diminishing .",
    "it is no longer apparent that the star - formation rates seen in the distant bo galaxies are in any way extreme given the characteristics of the surrounding field population ( couch et al .",
    "while the only class of objects thought to be uniquely associated with the bo effect in the distant clusters , the post - starburst galaxy ( psg ) or `` e+a '' , have recently been discovered in the local field ( zabludoff et al .",
    "1996 ) . hence , although our study focuses on a sample of luminous x - ray clusters , our emphasis is to use the x - ray properties of the clusters to provide a well - defined sample of massive clusters and also to give some insight into their dynamical states , rather than to simply test possible interactions between the galaxy populations and the cluster x - ray gas .",
    "we briefly describe the structure of this paper .",
    "section 2 details the observations and their reduction and analysis . in section 3 we catalogue the galaxy populations in our clusters before describing our analysis of these catalogues to study the properties of the cluster populations , both the evolved red spheroidal systems and the star forming galaxies associated with the clusters .",
    "finally , in section 4 we discuss our results and give our main conclusions .",
    "the cluster sample we elected to use for this study is ideally suited for investigating the properties of the galaxy populations in the most massive collapsed structures at @xmath16 .",
    "the sample contains a total of 24 of the most luminous x - ray clusters in the redshift range 0.2@xmath170.3 selected from the northern section of the rosat all sky survey , as given in an early compilation of the brightest cluster sample of ebeling et al .",
    "these clusters all have x - ray luminosities in excess of @xmath180.12.4@xmath19 erg s@xmath20 , kms / sec / mpc and @xmath21 unless otherwise stated . ] indicating that their typical masses are : @xmath22 and they thus represent some of the most massive collapsed structures known .",
    "this is also supported by the richnesses of these systems as demonstrated by our analysis below .",
    "the x - ray luminosities derived from rosat hri imaging are presented in table  1 and are discussed in more detail in edge et al .",
    "( 1997a , in prep ) .",
    "the sample has also been subjected to extensive x - ray observations , providing deep , high resolution x - ray images of all the clusters and x - ray spectroscopy of all but one .",
    "these x - ray images show that the majority of the clusters have relatively simple morphologies , the most obvious exception being the bimodal cluster a1758 ( fig .",
    "1 ) which exhibits a highly elongated x - ray morphology .",
    "most importantly for the simple comparison of their galaxy populations , the whole sample spans only a modest range in redshift , minimizing differential k corrections .",
    "we have obtained deep and wide - field , multi - colour imaging of a subsample of 10 of these clusters ( those whose right ascensions lie in the range 1322@xmath23 ) for the analysis here .",
    "one particular feature of this project has been our use of a blue sensitive ccd , allowing us to acquire deep @xmath11-band ( restframe @xmath24  in the mid  uv ) images of the clusters .",
    "the @xmath11 filter used for this study is a copy of bessell s @xmath11 ( bessell 1990 ) kindly made available to us by dr .",
    "j.  schombert .",
    "our standard johnson @xmath25 and cousins @xmath26 exposures provide complimentary information on the cluster galaxies at restframe wavelengths around @xmath27  and @xmath28 , very close to @xmath11 and @xmath29 respectively .",
    "the catalogue of candidate gravitationally lensed features from our survey is given in edge et al .",
    "( 1997b ) , while the galaxy populations in some of the individual clusters are briefly discussed in smail et al .",
    "( 1995b ) and allen et al .",
    "x - ray imaging of the clusters in this sample are presented in edge et al .",
    "( 1997a ) .",
    "the data discussed here comprise @xmath0 imaging of all 10 clusters .",
    "these data were acquired using the cosmic imaging spectrograph and a thinned 2048@xmath30 tek detector on the 5-m hale telescope at palomar during the nights of june 9 - 12 1994 and july 5 - 7 1994 .",
    "this detector provides 0.284 arcsec sampling over a large , @xmath31 arcmin , field with very good response into the near - ultraviolet .",
    "the bulk of the data analysed here was taken in good conditions during the june run .",
    "the median seeing in the @xmath26-band during these nights was 1.10 arcsec and the nights appeared stable and photometric .",
    "a log giving the field identifications , positions , exposure times and seeing is presented in table  1 .",
    "the reddening values come from the estimated hi column densities in these fields , using the conversion @xmath32 ) .",
    "the exposures typically comprise a 3000 s integration in @xmath11 , along with shorter 500 s integrations in @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "these exposures were split into @xmath334 sub - exposures to allow for cosmic - ray rejection during processing .",
    "observations of landolt ( 1992 ) standard fields were interspersed between the science exposures .",
    "standard iraf reduction procedures were used to process both the science frames and standards .",
    "firstly the images had their bias levels calculated from the overscan region and this subtracted from the exposure , which was then trimmed .",
    "flatfields were constructed from either dome ( @xmath11 ) or twilight observations ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) to roughly remove sensitivity gradients across the detector .",
    "having initially flattened the frames , we then cleaned them of the brighter galaxies and stars and used a median algorithm to stack all the cleaned frames in a given filter for each night .",
    "this created an illumination correction frame which was smoothed with a large box filter , normalised and divided through the science frames to remove any remaining mismatch between the `` true '' sky illumination and that removed by the flatfields .",
    "these frames were then aligned and coadded with a rejection algorithm to eliminate the cosmic rays .",
    "examples of the final reduced images are given in fig .",
    "1 .    total exposure times and seeing from the final stacked images are listed in table  1 .",
    "analysis of the standard star exposures through the nights confirms our impression that all the nights used for this project were photometric .",
    "photometric calibration of our science exposures indicates average zero point errors contribute to the scatter in the colours at the level of @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "analysis of the colour terms for our filter+detector combinations shows that these are negligible compared to the reddening corrections ( table  1 ) and so we have applied only the latter correction ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) . combining the uncertainty in the reddenings ( @xmath38 ) with the zero point errors",
    ", we estimate that our colours are accurate to @xmath39 and @xmath40 on average .",
    "we have tested the accuracy of our photometry ( and the reddening corrections ) using the distribution of reddening - corrected colours for objects identified as stars on our frames . comparing the distribution in ",
    "colours for stars identified in each cluster to that given in landolt ( 1992 ) using a two dimensional k - s test we find only two instances of significant ( @xmath41% ) offsets , these are in the @xmath25 photometry of a2390 ( @xmath42 ) and a2261 ( @xmath43 ) . applying these corrections and then combining the stellar colour distributions for 314 stars in the ten clusters we determine limits on the maximum offsets in our mean colours of @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the errors on these offsets are consistent with those claimed for the individual passbands .",
    "sample which had blue  colours , but were very red in .",
    "these objects have @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "their colours indicate that they are most likely to be @xmath52 qsos , in which case we would estimate a space density of such objects of @xmath53 degree@xmath54 .",
    "the two objects lie in a1758 ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) and a2261 ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) , at radii of 330 and 240 arcsec from the central galaxies .",
    "the object in a1758 is also detected as an x - ray source in the pspc / hri images of this cluster . ]    having aligned and calibrated our @xmath0 images we now create object catalogues from the @xmath26-band images of each cluster .",
    "for this we use the sextractor package ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) to detect and analyse galaxies on the @xmath26 frames .",
    "we adopt a detection criteria of 10 contiguous pixels each 1@xmath59 ( of the pixel - to - pixel noise ) above the local background , after convolution with a @xmath60 pixel top - hat filter .",
    "these catalogues are then visually inspected and cleaned of spurious objects ( e.g.  diffraction spikes and noise objects in the halos of a few very bright stars ) .",
    "the coordinates from the cleaned object catalogues so created are then used to measure colours (  and ) for all the objects detected . before measuring colours , however , we first match the seeing in the @xmath0 frames from the profiles of stars in the images .",
    "we have chosen to use a fixed angular size photometry aperture , 3.0 arcsec in diameter ( 6.87.9 @xmath61 kpc ) , rather than a fixed metric aperture to simplify the field corrections for our catalogues .",
    "we discuss the uncertainties which arise from this later in the paper .",
    "these apertures are sufficiently large that we should detect the bulk of the light from both bulge and disk components of luminous galaxies in these clusters .",
    "the final frames typically cover an area of @xmath62 sq .",
    "arcmin to an 80% completeness limit of @xmath6323.0 ( table  1 ) , where these values are estimated from comparing the observed galaxy counts with those expected from deeper field observations ( smail et al .",
    "1995a ) . to determine galaxy luminosities we use the best magnitude provided by sextractor , which is based on a `` kron - type '' magnitude for brighter galaxies , with a fixed minimum aperture size for fainter objects . in our analysis we restrict ourselves to an @xmath64 sample to ensure @xmath65% completeness in all our fields .",
    "analysis of the other passbands shows that our exposures provide photometry to 20% accuracy to median limits of @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the final catalogues contain a total of 11,211 objects brighter than @xmath68 over an area of 898 sq .",
    "arcmin , of which 1138 have profiles consistent with being stars , giving an average surface density of @xmath69 galaxies arcmin@xmath54 , where the scatter is field - to - field .      to determine the field correction for our cluster frames we used the deep @xmath11 exposure analysed by hogg et al .",
    "this 28.0 ksec exposure covers an area of 81.0 sq .",
    "arcmin in a high - latitude blank field ( table  1 ) and was taken with the same instrument as used for our observations , although using a different @xmath11 filter . to supplement this observation we acquired 500s exposures of the field in @xmath25 and @xmath26 during the night of january 31 1997 ( table  1 ) .",
    "these frames were reduced in the same manner as the cluster observations .",
    "calibration of these data was provided from observations of landolt ( 1992 ) standard stars , observed before and after the science exposures , giving zero point errors of @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "we confirm the accuracy of the colours determined from these fields using the locus of stars on the colour - colour plane as was done for the cluster observations .",
    "the objects in this field were catalogued in a similar manner to the cluster observations , starting with an @xmath26-selected sample and measuring colours in seeing - matched apertures .",
    "the precision of these colours is similar to that achieved in our cluster observations due to equivalent exposure times for the @xmath25 and @xmath26 observations .",
    "the final catalogue contains 377 galaxies brighter than @xmath68 , or a surface density of @xmath72 galaxies arcmin@xmath54 , where the variation is estimated from independent sub - regions within the field .",
    "as we will show the clusters studied here are sufficiently rich , given their redshifts , that field contamination only becomes an important correction at the faintest magnitudes discussed .",
    "to @xmath73 the typical cluster frame contains 315 galaxies , of which 90 ( 28% ) are expected to be field contamination , predominantly blue galaxies , this fraction increases to 40% at @xmath74 , the faintest limit used in this work . in our analysis",
    "we will ignore the effects on the estimated field correction of gravitational amplification of the background field population .",
    "the majority of our analysis focuses on galaxies with red optical colours and for these we expect the effects of lensing to actually lower the background field density ( c.f .",
    "broadhurst et al .",
    "1997 ) , leading to a slight over - correction for field contamination .",
    "we start by describing the general colour distribution of galaxies within our clusters , before identifying particular groups of objects and discussing their properties in more detail in the following sections .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "2 the distribution of galaxies on the colour - colour ( c - c ) plane in each of the 10 clusters , after correcting for field contamination .",
    "we also show the composite colour distribution for all the clusters combined .",
    "all of these plots use only those objects classified as galaxies and with magnitudes brighter than @xmath75 .",
    "no differential k corrections , to compensate for the different cluster redshifts , have been applied to any of these plots . in fig .",
    "3 we present the combined cluster sample as three independent magnitude slices , along with the whole sample . on these plots we have marked the locus of colours expected for the spectral energy distributions ( sed ) representative of the spectral types of galaxies with e , sab , sbc , scd and sdm morphologies in the local universe ( effectively a series of increasing ratio of current to average star - formation rate ) , as they would be observed at @xmath76 .",
    "it can be seen that the clusters contain galaxies spanning the whole range of star - formation rates observed in the local field . at bright magnitudes , however , the distribution is dominated by a population of galaxies whose  and  colours similar to unevolved elliptical galaxies at these redshifts . as we look at fainter luminosities within the clusters we find a gradual increase in the number of blue galaxies , with colours ranging across those expected from galaxies with star - formation rates similar to local sbc to sdm galaxies .",
    "a similarly wide range in galaxy colours is also seen for the brightest cluster galaxies ( fig .",
    "3 ) , these are typically d or cd galaxies , and although a number of them show the red colours expected for such massive spheroidal systems , three show substantially bluer colours indicating significant on - going star - formation ( allen 1995 ) .",
    "we now identify three groups of cluster galaxies on the   colour - colour plane to @xmath74 and",
    "use these to highlight the various components of the cluster populations . at this depth",
    "the median photometric errors are @xmath77 and @xmath78 , with 80% of the objects having errors less than @xmath79 and @xmath80 , adequate to define independent regions of the colour - colour plane .",
    "in particular the accuracy of our photometry allows us to robustly separate samples of galaxies using this colour , which measures the strength of their 4000  breaks .",
    "the three groups we identify are : 1 ) a large population of galaxies with colours similar to passive elliptical galaxies at the cluster redshift ; 2 ) the cluster population with colours typical of star - forming galaxies at @xmath81 ; 3 ) a number of galaxies whose  colours indicate a strong 4000  break , representative of an evolved stellar population , but which have bluer  colours than group # 1 showing that they are , or recently have been , forming stars . for ease of use we have called these three groups : `` red '' , `` blue '' and `` uv+ '' . to estimate the relative proportions of these groups within the clusters we define rough limits of their boundaries on the , colour - colour plane as : [ 0.1:0.9,2.9:3.6 ] for red , [ @xmath821.1:0.9,1.9:2.9 ] for blue and [ @xmath821.1:0.1,2.9:3.6 ] for uv+ .",
    "note that the exact definitions of the samples used in our analysis below vary according to what questions we are attempting to answer , we have used the regions above simply to illustrate the distribution of objects in the various groups .",
    "the typical proportions of the three cluster populations are then : [ 0.95,0.05,0.00 ] to @xmath83 and [ 0.66,0.29,0.05 ] to @xmath84 .",
    "we give the proportions in the individual clusters in table  2 .",
    "the average radial distributions of the three galaxy populations in the clusters within 500 @xmath61 kpc of the cluster centres are shown in fig .",
    "4 . outside of @xmath85",
    "kpc the profile of the red galaxies drops as @xmath86 , close to the value expected for an isothermal distribution .",
    "the uv+ population follows a radial distribution close to that of the red galaxies , although with a large scatter , @xmath87 . while the blue galaxy distribution is considerably flatter with @xmath88 .",
    "finally , we can identify one further sample of galaxies on the c - c plane : those galaxies with colours substantially redder than the cluster elliptical sequence in  ( which provides a good measure of the strength of the 4000  break at the cluster redshifts ) .",
    "this last group consists of galaxies which are probably background to the cluster , as the elliptical sequence represents galaxies with the strongest 4000  breaks at the cluster redshift , and as such we do not discuss them further here .",
    "the number of objects lying substantially redward of the cluster sequence in  is consistent with the number expected from our field distributions .      the most obvious feature of the   plots in figs .",
    "2 and 3 is the strong clump of red galaxies in all the clusters .",
    "the clump is populated with the luminous elliptical galaxies which dominate the bright end of the cluster population .",
    "replotting the catalogues as colour - magnitude ( c - m ) diagrams illustrates another property of this population  a very narrow colour - luminosity relation in both @xmath26 and @xmath26 ( fig .  5 ) .",
    "in both panels the elliptical sequence slants down , indicating that the spheroidal galaxies have bluer colours at fainter luminosities , a result of lower mean metallicities in the low luminosity galaxies ( kodama & arimoto 1997 ) . in the fainter samples in fig  3 , however , this population appears to disperse , a feature which may be associated with the apparent `` break '' at @xmath89 in the red elliptical sequence on the @xmath26 plane .",
    "we return to discuss this feature later .",
    "the first question we wish to investigate is the variation in the typical colours of the brighter spheroidal galaxies across the clusters . as we discussed in the introduction ,",
    "the dispersion in the restframe uv  optical colours of galaxies is a sensitive test of their recent star - formation , and the variation of the mean colours for the spheroidal population can give powerful constraints on their formation epoch ( ble ; ellis et al .",
    "1997 ) as well as the formation of the larger structures they inhabit . to study this scatter we fit to the colour - luminosity relation in our clusters and then correct these fits to a fiducial cluster at @xmath76 ( the mean of our sample ) to compare the various values .",
    "we fit a linear relation ( @xmath90 or the equivalent for ) to the c - m relation using the same technique applied by ble and ellis et al .",
    "( 1997 ) : huber s robust estimator , after removal of probable field contamination .",
    "galaxies are rejected from the fit interactively until the fit is stable to the inclusion of remaining points , the expected number of field galaxies is used as a guide to indicate the numbers of galaxies to be removed ( typically @xmath91 galaxies , or @xmath92% of the sample ) .",
    "we have confirmed that these fits are not sensitive to modest changes in the definition of the red sub - sample region on the c - c plane .",
    "we then fit the resulting sample across a fixed range in absolute luminosity corresponding to @xmath93 $ ] ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "for simplicity we parameterise the variation in apparent magnitude across the redshift range of our sample , for a @xmath95 galaxy with a non - evolved elliptical sed the apparent magnitude is : @xmath96 .",
    "the fits are evaluated at an absolute magnitude corresponding to @xmath97 at @xmath76 , roughly @xmath98 .",
    "we then apply differential k corrections to the intercept values to convert them to a cluster observed in  or  at @xmath76 , the corrections assume a non - evolved elliptical sed and are parameterised as : k@xmath99 and k@xmath100 to 2% accuracy .",
    "these corrections amount to @xmath101 in  and @xmath102 in , with uncertainties of @xmath103 at a fixed luminosity .",
    "the different k corrections associated with the variation in galaxy colour along the elliptical sequence will introduce a scatter into the corrected colours .  from the slope of the c - m relations we expect this to be at the level of @xmath104 and @xmath105 , where the slope is steeper in both colours at higher redshifts .",
    "this is substantially larger than the colour variations introduced between clusters due to our adoption of a fixed aperture size for our photometry , @xmath106 , and so we ignore the effects of the variation in metric aperture size across the different clusters .",
    "we obtain the fits listed in table  3a and 3b ( for  and  respectively ) .  from these",
    "we determine average slopes for the c - m sequence of @xmath107 and @xmath108 , where the scatter within the sample is comparable to the typical errors on the fit .",
    "we have therefore simply adopted these average slopes for all the clusters .",
    "next to simplify the comparison of the clusters we fix the relevant slopes at these average values and refit to our data , across two absolute magnitude ranges : @xmath93 $ ] ( @xmath109 ) and a more restrictive range @xmath110 $ ] ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "the results of these fits ( evaluated at @xmath97 ) are listed in table  4 and we illustrate the values for the complete sample in fig .  6 .",
    "these values show a remarkably small dispersion , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , while for the smaller , bright subsamples we obtain @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "we find no statistically significant correlation between the mean colours in the two passbands .",
    "the typical colours of the bright elliptical cluster population derived above are similar to those expected from a local l@xmath116 elliptical galaxy placed at @xmath76 : @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "the observed colours are offset by @xmath119 and @xmath120 compared to these .",
    "these offsets are in a similar sense to the limits we placed on the relative offset of the colours of stars in our fields compared to the distribution in landolt ( 1992 ) . taking the uncertainty in our absolute colour system into consideration we can only place weak limits on the extent of colour evolution of cluster ellipticals out to @xmath76 .",
    "looking at the average  c - m slope we derived from our clusters , we can crudely compare this with that measured in @xmath121 using the slope observed in @xmath122 for spheroidal galaxies in coma by ble .",
    "they find @xmath123 , the expected slope in @xmath124 is @xmath125 ( kodama & arimoto 1997 ) , indicating a predicted slope of @xmath126 , only slightly steeper than the observed value in our distant clusters of @xmath127 .",
    "unfortunately , there is little information on the uv properties of cluster ellipticals shortward of the atmospheric cut - off and so we can not compare the observed slope in  with a locally determined value .    turning to the scatter in the mean colours of the elliptical sequences between the clusters .",
    "the random errors in the calibration of the clusters are approximately @xmath128 and @xmath129 , removing these contributions from the observed scatter would indicate intrinsic @xmath130 dispersions of @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the red , spheroidal populations brighter than @xmath133 are remarkably homogeneous across all 10 clusters in our sample at a lookback time of @xmath134 gyrs .",
    "we also note that the small spread in colours for the brighter ellipticals in the clusters would allow them to be used as a crude , but economical , redshift indicator provided the colour evolution of the population can be calibrated for a number of clusters spanning the redshift range of interest .",
    "the observed scatter in the mean  colour of the bright cluster ellipticals , including measurement errors , is @xmath135 , corresponding to an accuracy in the estimated redshift of @xmath136 ( c.f .",
    "belloni et al .  1995 ) .",
    "a complete analysis of the expected scatter in the mean colour of the elliptical sequences within rich clusters will require a combined spectral modelling and press - schechter approach ( e.g.  baugh et al .",
    "nevertheless , we can use a simple , if somewhat contrived , model to understand what general constraints our observations provide on the discreteness of the structures which coalesce to form rich clusters . in the model , clusters form from sub - units ( groups ) of galaxies each containing a fixed number of elliptical galaxies , @xmath137 .",
    "the elliptical galaxies within a given groups have synchronised formation at some epoch ( this could be thought of as relating to the collapse redshift of the group ) which we distribute uniformly in time between the big bang and a cut - off time , @xmath138 , when elliptical formation ceases in all structures .",
    "we define @xmath138 relative to @xmath76 and hence @xmath139 means that elliptical formation continues right up to @xmath76 , while @xmath140 gyrs ( @xmath141 ) corresponds to a time 5 gyrs prior to @xmath76 or roughly @xmath142 . in the press - schechter models",
    "the redshift cut - off and the distributions in relative formation times for ellipticals within the groups would probably both be functions of group mass , as well as cosmology , but the current model is sufficient to illustrate the technique .",
    "we now determine what joint constraints our observed cluster - to - cluster scatter in , restframe @xmath121 , provides on the numbers of structures from which the clusters were built , and the most recent epoch of elliptical formation in these structures .",
    "we use the spectral evolution model of fioc & rocca - volmerange ( 1997 ) for elliptical galaxies to determine the evolution in the rest - frame @xmath121 colours of the galaxies .",
    "starting from the observed number of ellipticals in the cluster , we randomly select groups of @xmath137 galaxies and assign them a formation epoch uniformly in the available time interval , from this we determine their @xmath121 colour at @xmath76 . we repeat this until we have fully populated the cluster and then calculate the mean colour of the elliptical population in the cluster before moving onto the next cluster , until all have their full complements of elliptical galaxies . with values for the mean colours of the elliptical population in each of the 10 model clusters",
    "we next estimate the scatter in the colours _ between",
    "_ the clusters .",
    "this proceedure is repeated 10,000 times for each combination of @xmath137 and @xmath138 to estimate the likelihood that the scatter amongst the 10 model clusters would be less than or equal to that observed for those parameters .",
    "looking at fig  7 it is apparent that as we form the cluster from larger and larger sub - units ( higher @xmath137 ) then the scatter between the clusters should increase .",
    "remembering that all the galaxies within a given sub - unit form together , but that the sub - units themselves can form at any point within the available time period , we can see that this constraint arises from the increasing shot - noise in the average colour of the cluster population when it is formed from a smaller and smaller number of independent sub - units . at one extreme",
    "where each cluster forms as a single group of ellipticals , @xmath143 , which themselves all formed together at a given time , then the scatter between the clusters simply reflects the scatter between the formation times of the original groups and these are therefore constrained to all have formed in a relatively short period of time ( to minimise the scatter between their present day colours ) .",
    "such a model might represent the result of a top - down formation of clusters from large zeldovich pancakes with the bright ellipticals being formed in the first collapse .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "7 we could constrain the elliptical formation to occur at least @xmath1447 gyrs ( @xmath141 ) before @xmath76 or @xmath145 . at the other extreme , where the clusters form from accreting individual elliptical galaxies , @xmath146,whose formation epochs are uncorrelated",
    ", we see that given the large number of ellipticals within each cluster the mean colours of the clusters have a very small scatter and hence the constraint on the last period of star - formation in the elliptical population is much weaker ( equivalent to @xmath147 ) .",
    "taking an intermediate case , if the clusters typically form from sub - clumps and groups containing @xmath92 ellipticals , and the formation of the galaxies within each group is synchronised , then these structures must have formed their galaxies at least 5 gyrs ( @xmath141 ) before @xmath76 ( 95% c.l . ) , equivalent to @xmath148 .",
    "requiring that the bulk of the ellipticals form much earlier than this ( e.g.  @xmath52 , ellis et al .",
    "1997 ) would mean that we could only rule out their coherent , stochastic formation in large structures ( @xmath149 ) .",
    "the colours of the bright cluster ellipticals indicate that this population is remarkably homogeneous between clusters .",
    "we can further test this homogeneity by investigating the scatter in the amount of baryonic material locked up as stars in the cluster ellipticals , as compared to the total mass of the cluster .",
    "the simplest method to achieve this is to compare the luminosity in the elliptical sequence to the cluster x - ray temperatures for the 7 clusters with published temperatures ( mushotzky & scharf 1997 ) .",
    "we determine the total spheroidal luminosity in our cluster by simply integrating the light in the cluster sequences defined above down to @xmath133 across the whole field ( an effective radius of @xmath150 mpc in a typical cluster ) .",
    "the values obtained , along with a bootstrap estimate of their uncertainties , are given in table  5 .",
    "we find a reasonable linear correlation ( fig .",
    "8) between the the integrated red galaxy luminosities and the x - ray temperatures : @xmath151 , where the fit has been constrained to pass through [ 0,0 ] .",
    "the dispersion around this line is small , only 17% , ( compared to @xmath152% when @xmath8 is used in place of @xmath153 ) indicating that the integrated luminosity of the red galaxy population is a good tracer of the total mass of the cluster .",
    "in fact the `` true '' scatter may be less when proper account is taken of the roles of mergers and cooling flows in changing the observed x - ray temperatures .",
    "parameterising the ratio of the cluster mass to the luminosity of the elliptical population as : @xmath154 , and assuming an isothermal gas distribution with @xmath155 we find @xmath156 for @xmath157 in solar units and @xmath153 in kev .",
    "thus the observed best fit slope corresponds to @xmath158 in the restframe @xmath159-band . including the observed passive evolution of the stellar populations ( see  3.2 ) this corresponds to an equivalent @xmath160 value of @xmath161 .",
    "this compares well to the value for the coma cluster of @xmath162 within @xmath163 mpc ( transformed from the @xmath25-band value of fusco - femiano & hughes 1994 ) .      while the proportion of galaxies falling in the uv+ region of the fig .",
    "3 is small at bright magnitudes , constituting only @xmath164% of the cluster population brighter than @xmath165 , it substantially increases as we reach fainter into the cluster population ( table  2 ) .",
    "the colour selection used to define this sample is sufficiently wide that it will include all cluster galaxies with strong 4000  breaks ( e  s0sa ) , which also show blue  colours .",
    "the accuracy of our  colours means that we expect little contamination of the sample from later spectral types ( with bluer 4000  colours ) .",
    "we now investigate the relation between this population and the apparent break in the c - m relation for the cluster ellipticals in @xmath26 . to do this we first look at the luminosity distribution of galaxies lying along the elliptical c - m sequences defined above .",
    "we select a wedge - shaped region parallel to the c - m sequence with a width varying from @xmath1660.33 ( @xmath1670.43 ) from @xmath16822.0 , the increasing width of the region at fainter limits compensates for the increased photometric errors .",

    ". using these areas we determine counts from the combined cluster sample and correct these using the same regions of the field galaxy colour - magnitude plane . the magnitudes and colours for the cluster galaxies",
    "are corrected to those of a fiducial cluster at @xmath76 using the k corrections suitable for a non - evolved elliptical sed ( consistent with the typical colours observed for this population ) .",
    "we plot the luminosity distributions determined from both colour - magnitude planes ( fig .",
    "9 ) . to parameterise the differences between these two lfs we have fitted composite gaussian+schechter functions ( e.g.  wilson et al .  1997 ) to the distributions and these are over - plotted in fig .  9 .",
    "the only free parameter in the fit is the faint end slope of the schechter function .",
    "the parameters of the gaussian function ( @xmath170 and @xmath171 ) have been fixed to agree with the luminosity function of elliptical galaxies in local clusters ( binggeli , sandage & tammann 1985 , bst ; thompson & gregory 1993 ; biviano et al .",

    "these correspond to @xmath178 , or @xmath179 mag brighter than the @xmath180 value .",
    "this is in good agreement with the expectation from luminosity evolution of a passively evolving stellar population formed at high redshift ( @xmath181 ,  3.3 ; barger et al .",
    "the characteristic magnitude of the schechter function is fixed at @xmath169 , @xmath182 .",
    "the main feature of interest in fig .",
    "9 is the difference in the relative numbers of galaxies lying on the red cluster sequence beyond @xmath183 , there being considerably fewer in the  sequence .",

    "thus we confirm the visual impression from the @xmath26 c - m diagram that there is a decline in the number of red sequence members at magnitudes fainter than @xmath89 ( @xmath187 ) . splitting the selected sample on the basis of radius from the cluster center we see at most a very marginal preference for the decrement to be greater in the cluster centre ( @xmath188 kpc ) .",
    "this is as expected given the similarity of the radial profiles of the uv+ and red galaxies shown in fig .",
    "4 .    to search for the cause of the dip we select those galaxies lying along the elliptical sequence in the -@xmath26 c - m plane and study the distribution of their  colours .",

    "the remaining seven galaxies split roughly equally into s0 and e. with only three galaxies in each class ( we remove the s0/a ) , our conclusions are limited , however , we note that the s0 galaxies tend to be bluer in both  ( @xmath201 versus @xmath202 , where the errors on the means are bootstrap estimates ) and  ( @xmath203 versus @xmath204 ) , as well as spanning a wider range in  colours than the ellipticals , @xmath205 as opposed to @xmath206 . to determine the significance of this difference in the dispersions , we simulate a gaussian distribution with a dispersion equal to that of the combined e+s0 sample and ask how often we expect the ratio of the relative dispersions of random subsets of three galaxies to exceed that observed ( @xmath207 ) .",
    "this occurs in only 2% of cases , which would imply that there maybe a real difference between the  colour ranges of e and s0 galaxies .",
    "we conclude that the majority of the cluster galaxies with @xmath183 and red  colours are spheroidal systems ( e or s0 ) and that the bluer half of these contains 70% s0 galaxies .",
    "the relatively strong 4000  breaks in the uv+ galaxies means that in the absence of dynamical effects , we would expect them to undergo only modest fading in their restframe optical luminosities between @xmath208 and today , not much above that expected for the elliptical population , @xmath209 .",

    "first we determine the blue fractions ( @xmath212 ) in our clusters , following the prescription of butcher & oemler ( 1984 , bo ) .",
    "they estimate the radius in the cluster which contains 30% of the population brighter than @xmath133 . using this radius",
    "they then calculate the fraction of the @xmath213 population within that aperture which have restframe @xmath214 colours bluer than 0.2 mag below the elliptical sequence . defining the cluster centre from our x - ray images , and correcting for the field counts , we determine the values for @xmath215 and @xmath216 , the number of cluster galaxies within this radius , given in table  5 .",
    "table  5 also gives the concentration index , @xmath217 , as defined by bo .",
    "the only remaining step is to determine the equivalent colour boundary for our passbands .",
    "we have the colour of the elliptical sequence in each cluster (  3.1 ) , we need to transform an offset of @xmath218 in the restframe into a difference in the observed  colour at @xmath208 . for this purpose",
    "we simply fit the variation in restframe @xmath214 colour with observed  colour for the non - evolved seds used earlier .  from these fits",
    "we can derive the  offset which provides the equivalent colour difference in the restframe @xmath214 .",
    "a colour of @xmath219 is between an sab and sbc sed ( 0.67 sab + 0.33 sbc ) and equivalent to an offset of @xmath220 from the observed elliptical c - m sequence . using this limit and the observed elliptical sequences we determine the blue fractions given in table  5 .",
    "we have one cluster in common with the original bo study : a1758 . for this",
    "we derive @xmath221 , @xmath222 arcmin and @xmath223 , in good agreement with the values published by bo : @xmath224 , @xmath225 arcmin and @xmath226 .",
    "the median @xmath212 for the concentrated clusters in our sample , those with @xmath227 , is @xmath228 .",
    "this is slightly lower than the value of @xmath229 for a similar sample of @xmath100.3 clusters in butcher & oemler s original work , perhaps indicating a tendency for these massive clusters to contain a smaller proportion of active galaxies than typically seen in a broad range of collapsed structures at their epochs .",
    "it should be a goal of any future studies to investigate such possibilities by contrasting the properties of galaxy populations in massive and less massive structures at a single epoch .",
    "while the individual cluster cores contain so few luminous , blue galaxies ( typically 23 per cluster ) that the individual values of @xmath212 are not well determined , the presence of such a small number of star - forming galaxies in the core regions of these clusters does mean that they do not show any butcher - oemler effect .",
    "the scatter in our @xmath230 sample is considerable , @xmath231 , and somewhat intriguing given that the clusters are all concentrated and in addition span both a small range in mass and a restricted redshift range .",
    "looking at the concentrated clusters with the two highest @xmath212 values ( we ignore the two @xmath232 clusters ) we can see no obvious distinction between them and the remainder of the sample . similarly focusing on the most bimodal cluster , a1758",
    ", we also see no indication of atypical blue fractions in this system .",
    "evidence has been presented for recent mergers in both a2219 ( smail et al .",
    "1995b ) and a2390 ( pierre et al .",
    "1996 ) from detailed lensing analysis , although the blue populations in neither cluster shows any strong evidence for a recent influx of star - forming galaxies .",
    "we conclude that the wide range in @xmath212 seen in our sample probably results from small accretion events which , while adding a few star - forming galaxies to the cluster , do not substantially alter its morphology , mass or x - ray luminosity .",
    "this is not to say that the accretion of a more massive structure would not effect the cluster , just that such events appear not to substantially alter the mix of galaxies in the cores of massive clusters at @xmath160.3 .    in the light of this",
    "we address the recent claim by wang & ulmer ( 1997 , wu ) of a correlation between the blue fraction , @xmath212 , and the ellipticity of the x - ray emission on large scales in a sample of clusters at @xmath2330.6 .",
    "we show the original data from wang & ulmer ( 1997 ) in figure  11 , where we also give similar observations of 5 clusters in our sample ( those for which pspc images are available ) .",
    "we have remeasured the ellipticities of the x - ray emission in all the clusters , both those in wu and the new clusters added here , inside a radius of 750 @xmath61 kpc , to confirm that our new measurements are on the same scale as the earlier values .",
    "we find a mean offset between the wu values and our measurements of : @xmath234 , with a typical deviation of @xmath235 between the estimates .",
    "we conclude that our ellipticity measurements are in good agreement with those presented in wu and hence we can add our clusters to their sample .",
    "the addition of our high luminosity clusters to the already heterogenous sample from wu obviously does not improve the correlation seen in their data ( although neither does it completely destroy it ) .",
    "moreover , we note that the presence of two points at high@xmath236 and high@xmath212 appears to be responsible for much of the significance of their original correlation",
    ". one of these is the cluster a2125 , which has an x - ray luminosity of only a tenth of the next lowest luminosity cluster in the sample , and as such is clearly a very different object to the remaining clusters in the figure . removing this single object to provide",
    "a more homogenous sample also removes any statistically significant correlation between @xmath212 and @xmath236 .",
    "we therefore caution that the @xmath212@xmath236 correlation reported by wang & ulmer ( 1997 ) may be simply the result of a small and diverse sample .",
    "the lack of any correlation between @xmath212 and @xmath236 for luminous x - ray clusters at @xmath237 should not be surprising given the generally low level of butcher - oemler activity in these clusters and their wide range of morphologies .",
    "while our sample of clusters does lack a large population of luminous blue galaxies , looking at the values in table  2 we can see that they do harbour a substantial population of star - forming galaxies , albeit at considerably fainter magnitudes than those used to trace the butcher - oemler effect . as we show below the characteristic @xmath159-band luminosity of the blue populations in these clusters",
    "is considerably fainter than the cluster ellipticals , in contrast to the situation in more distant clusters at @xmath12 where the blue , spiral population have a characteristic luminosity brighter than that of the ellipticals ( smail et al .",
    "this may be hinting at a redshift ",
    "luminosity relation for the active populations in the clusters , with the characteristic luminosity of the star - forming class of galaxies increasing with redshift . a similar proposal",
    "has recently been made for the evolution of the star - forming population in the distant field ( lilly et al .",
    "lilly et al .",
    "( 1995 ) claim that the characteristic luminosity of the bluer field galaxies may brighten by up to a magnitude out to @xmath12 . combining this evolution with the increased accretion rate onto massive clusters at moderate redshifts it may be possible to explain the redshift evolution of the butcher - oemler effect using a simple infall model ( bower 1991 ) .",
    "we now look in more detail at the colour distribution within this faint blue cluster population to better understand its subsequent evolution .",
    "we address this using the two dimensional distributions from fig .  3 and project these onto the axis defined by the non - evolved seds seen in that figure .",
    "this allows us to crudely classify the various galaxy populations , in terms of their equivalent present - day spectral type .",
    "we see a broad distribution of spectral classes , the frequency and breadth of this distribution is at odds with that seen at similar luminosities in comparably massive local clusters .",
    "fitting to the luminosity distribution of the population with colours of an sab or bluer in , we find @xmath238 and a steeply rising faint end slope , @xmath239 .",
    "thus the characteristic luminosity of this population is @xmath240 , about 2.5 mag fainter than the elliptical population .",
    "this is in contrast to more distant clusters where the spiral population has a characteristic luminosity similar to that of the cluster ellipticals ( smail et al .",
    "furthermore , the bulk of this population have colours similar to present - day sbc  scd galaxies , with comparatively few as blue as would be expected for vigorously star - forming sdm galaxies .",
    "although it should also be kept in mind that the absence of objects as blue as very late - type spirals from our clusters may be partly explained by the limiting magnitude of our sample ( @xmath241 ) . with the advent of mid  uv surveys of local clusters ( brosch et al .",
    "1997 ) , it will become possible to trace the evolution of the uv luminosity function ( and hence the mean star - formation rate ) in cluster environments from @xmath160 and compare this to the strong increase in star - formation seen in the distant field , amounting to a factor of @xmath242 increase in the luminosity density at 2800  out to @xmath243 ( lilly et al .",
    "such a comparison would determine whether the mean star - formation rates in clusters evolves in a similar manner to that in the surrounding field , or whether the cluster environment produces an additional long term decline in the star - formation of cluster galaxies at recent epochs .",
    "if the cluster environment is producing a widespread decline in the star - formation of member galaxies , we can ask how the clusters we see at @xmath81 might appear today , in particular where the various galaxy populations we have identified would appear in the luminosity distribution of a local rich cluster . to do this",
    "we need to model the evolution in their star - formation rates with time .",
    "this can only be done approximately , of course , given our lack of knowledge of their detailed dynamical history and previous star - formation .",
    "nevertheless , at this stage it sufficies to determine what the simplest model for the star - formation rate of the cluster population might predict at the present day .",
    "we start with the expectation that the star - formation in all cluster galaxies will decline towards the present , and hence for simplicity we have chosen to truncate the star - formation in all the cluster galaxies at @xmath76 and evolve them forward to the present day , allowing the galaxy s stellar populations to fade and redden by the amount expected from the models .",
    "one attractive model for stopping star - formation in cluster galaxies is to deplete their gas reservoirs by removing their halos through interaction with the intracluster medium ( larson , tinsley & caldwell 1980 ) . while other more drastic alternatives are possible , and may be necessary to form some of the more extreme spectral features observed in some cluster galaxies ( couch et al .",
    "1994 ) , this basic mechanism is sufficient to produce the drop in star - formation required in our simple model .",
    "we will next assume that a galaxy whose colours are similar to a particular spectral type at @xmath76 would , if left undisturbed , retain that spectral type until the present day .",
    "this allows us to use the evolutionary models of fioc & rocca - volmerange ( 1997 ) which fit the local spectral types ( e  sdm ) to describe the star - formation histories of the various galaxy populations in our clusters .",
    "we can then take these models and truncate the star - formation at @xmath76 before evolving them to @xmath160 . using fioc & rocca - volmerange s spectral synthesis code ( pegase , fioc & rocca - volmerange 1997 ) we",
    "can then determine the amount of fading and reddening the various spectral types would undergo , in their restframe @xmath29 and @xmath121 respectively .",
    "the evolution of the stellar populations after the star - formation ( if any ) is truncated produces different degrees of subsequent reddening between @xmath244 for an elliptical to @xmath245 for an sdm , the equivalent fading in the restframe @xmath29 is @xmath246 for an elliptical and @xmath247 for an sdm . and @xmath248 , giving a look - back time to @xmath76 of 4 gyrs . ]",
    "the predicted fading and reddening from our model should be viewed as the maximum allowed for a continously star - forming galaxy , both are lower in the event that either the star - formation was halted prior to @xmath76 and we are observing the already fading remnant , or the star - formation continues to lower redshift before being truncated",
    ". however , the predicted fading and reddening can be exceeded if the star - formation is burst - like , as appears to be necessary for modelling some of the spectral properties of distant cluster galaxies ( e.g.  couch et al .",
    "more substantial fading of this population would also result if dynamical processes ( stripping , harassment , etc ) removed stellar material from the galaxies .",
    "moreover , we would expect different fading rates across this population in those scenarios where the efficiency of removing material is a function of bulge strength ( i.e.  hubble type ) , as appears to be the case for the harassment mechanism ( moore et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "indeed , the harassment model predicts substantial stripping from later - types ( sdm / irr ) and low surface brightness galaxies , possibly amounting to @xmath24995% of their stellar material , while leaving early - type sab s relatively untouched ( apart from the truncation of the star - formation in their disks ) .",
    "thus it is conceivable that the strong - bulge , early - type spirals ( sab ) would suffer only the fading expected from the stellar population model , whereas the later - type spirals would fade considerably more than our predictions , possibly up to 24 mags ( moore et al .",
    "1997 ) , due to the stripping of stars from these systems .",
    "better predictions from the various theoretical models are required before we can make more detailed comparisons .    to begin with",
    "we ignore possible dynamical effects , and simply apply the evolution expected from our stellar models to the original distribution of galaxies in the cluster , as a function of their spectral type ( figure  12 ) .",
    "we show the results of this in figure  13 , where we give both the original distribution at @xmath76 and that which would be observed for the same cluster at @xmath160 . as can be seen in figure  13 , the truncation of all the star - formation in the clusters at @xmath76 results in a large population of faint , mid - type spiral galaxies moving towards the elliptical sequence . concentrating on these fading spirals",
    "we would predict a characteristic magnitude of @xmath250 at the present day , and the population would retain the steep faint end slope characteristic of the original blue cluster population ( @xmath239 ) . adding the dynamically - driven",
    ", type - dependent fading discussed above would tend to produce two families of remnents .",
    "the stronger bulged , and typically brighter , early - type spirals would end up around @xmath251 , perhaps identifying them as precursors to the uv+ group . while the bluer and later - type spirals would fade to @xmath252 , providing a natural source of the large population of dwarf elliptical ( de ) galaxies seen at these magnitudes in local clusters ( e.g.  bst ; gregory & thompson 1993 ) .",
    "for completeness we repeat the fit to the luminosity distribution of galaxies lying along the red sequence predicted for the local clusters ( using our simple fading model ) .",
    "we find that the evolution of the blue population leads to a general steepening of the faint end of the distribution .",
    "repeating the fit of a composite gaussian+schechter function to the luminosity distribution along the red sequence , we find that the faint end slope is expected to steepen by @xmath253 from @xmath254 to closer to @xmath255 as a result of the truncation of star - formation at @xmath76 . here",
    "we have evolved the parameters describing the brighter elliptical component to reflect the expected evolution to @xmath160 .",
    "the resulting faint - end slope lies close to that seen in the coma cluster today , @xmath256 ( biviano et al .  1995 ) .",
    "while our simple model has provided a possible outline of where the remnents of the galaxy populations identified in the distant clusters might be found today , we reiterate that much more detailed models , including information on both the dynamics and the previous evolutionary history of the galaxy populations , are needed to conclusively tackle this problem ( c.f .",
    "baugh et al .",
    "we have analysed the galaxy populations in the 10 luminous x - ray clusters in our sample on an individual cluster - by - cluster basis .",
    "the interest of this sample comes from its selection from the most massive clusters at @xmath16 , allowing a simple comparison to the properties of the richest local clusters .",
    "furthermore , using the uniformity of our sample and dataset we have been able to combine the galaxy populations across all the clusters to provide a more detailed view of their typical populations",
    ". the galaxy mix in our clusters at bright magnitudes is characterised by a population of luminous red galaxies , with only a small fraction of blue , star - forming galaxies ( @xmath257% ) and an even smaller fraction of uv+ objects ( @xmath164% ) .",
    "we find that the typical colours of the luminous ( @xmath258 ) red galaxies are highly homogenous across all the clusters in our sample .",
    "the intrinsic scatter in the typical colours of this population between clusters is @xmath2% in restframe @xmath121 . in our bluer colour , restframe @xmath259@xmath260",
    ", the scatter may be larger although our photometric precision is not as high , leading to a limit on the cluster - to - cluster variation of @xmath261% in their mean colours .",
    "these observations thus extend the studies of ble and ellis et al .",
    "( 1997 ) across a larger sample of clusters and into the mid  uv .",
    "we conclude that the brightest cluster galaxies comprise a homogeneous population longward of 2900  in their restframe .",
    "we illustrate the type of constraints on cluster formation which this observation can provide using a very simple model .",
    "the model allows us to convert the observed cluster - to - cluster scatter in the mean colours of cluster ellipticals into a joint constraint on the lower limit of the formation epoch for this population and the maximum size of the structures in which they can coherently form . while the model we use is not physically well motivated ,",
    "it does provide some insight into the information on cluster formation which these observations can provide .",
    "a rigorous theoretical analysis of the scatter expected in the colours of luminous ellipticals both within clusters ( e.g.  ellis et al .",
    "1997 ) and between clusters is urgently required .",
    "a comparison between the integrated luminosity of the red cluster galaxies with the x - ray temperatures of 7 of the clusters in our sample shows a good correlation between in the two observables with a scatter of only @xmath262% .",
    "we conclude that the total luminosity of the elliptical population in the clusters is a reasonable tracer of the cluster mass .",
    "again this is an interesting observation to tackle with theoretical models of cluster formation and growth , which can be robustly applied to our sample due to the well - defined cluster selection originally used .",
    "the picture of wide spread uniformity abruptly changes as we probe fainter in the clusters .",
    "beyond @xmath263 we start to detect an increasing population of blue cluster galaxies .",
    "these objects fall into two groups , galaxies blue in both  and  ( about @xmath152% of the population ) and those which while having blue  colours are red in : the uv+ galaxies , these are @xmath257% of the total cluster population and comprise @xmath210% of the faint cluster population with red  colours . the latter class of galaxies defines an extension of the narrow red sequence of the luminous ellipticals in the  c - m plane .",
    "the same is not true in  where they exhibit a substantial spread in colours , in contrast to the brighter ellipticals .",
    "a galaxy s flux around 2900 , as probed by our  colours , traces residual star - formation ( dorman et al .",
    "1995 ) , being @xmath210% more sensitive to low levels of star - formation than our  colour for standard imfs .",
    "thus the wide range in  colours for this population indicates a spread in current star - formation , albeit at a low enough level that it does nt substantially perturb their red  colours .",
    "the lack of a strong signature in the 4000  colours of these galaxies means they are not included in the standard butcher - oemler definition for the blue fraction of the cluster population , although neither are they completely passive .",
    "the fates of these two blue populations in present - day clusters are of considerable interest .",
    "we propose that , in the absence of dynamical processes or a reactivation of their star - formation , the uv+ population will undergo only modest fading in their optical luminosities from that observed at @xmath81 . as the clusters we study are amongst",
    "the most massive formed at their epoch , we assume that their galaxy populations should evolve to be similar to that seen in the richest local clusters . therefore , these galaxies should contribute a large proportion of the quiescent , red @xmath264 population in the most massive local clusters ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "of the @xmath183 galaxies in the distant clusters with red  colours , roughly 50% lie in a blue tail in .",
    "the high proportion of such objects indicates that a large fraction of the quiescent @xmath265 population in local clusters must have passed through this stage . the morphological mix in the coma cluster at these magnitudes is dominated by s0 galaxies , 65% of the population , with ellipticals making up 30% and sa s most of the remaining 5% ( dressler 1980 ) .",
    "thus while some of the uv+ galaxies may continue to form stars at a low level and hence appear as sa galaxies in the local clusters , the majority must be precursors to the s0 or e populations .",
    "moreover , the typical magnitude of these galaxies corresponds to a luminosity close to the characteristic value for the s0 populations in local clusters .",
    "bst claim a mean luminosity of @xmath266 for the s0 galaxies in virgo ( assuming @xmath267 ) , while thompson & gregory ( 1993 ) find @xmath268 for the s0 population of coma . in the light of this and",
    "the observations of a rapid decline in the numbers of s0 galaxies in @xmath269 clusters ( dressler et al .",
    "1997 ) , we suggest that the faint galaxies observed in our @xmath160.3 clusters with red  colours , but blue may be the precursors of today s s0 cluster population , whose characteristics they would closely match .    by",
    "morphologically classifying a small number of the @xmath183 red and uv+ population using wfpc-2 imaging of a2390 we demonstrate that the faint , red cluster population does consist of spheroidal galaxies and we also show marginal evidence that the s0 component of this population may exhibit a wider range , and typically bluer , mid ",
    "uv colours than the faint ellipticals .",
    "the substantial deficit of s0s in clusters at @xmath12 ( dressler et al .",
    "1997 ) , along with our suggested identification of the uv+ population with the precursor s of the s0 population of local rich clusters , would indicate that @xmath15 s0s should show some signs of their recent transformation .",
    "the spectral signatures of recent star - formation have been seen in samples of spheroidal galaxies from the coma cluster ( caldwell et al .",
    "1993 ) , although these have not been linked specifically to the s0 population .",
    "moreover , in a comparison of the dispersions in the @xmath122 colours of luminous ellipticals and s0s in coma , ble concluded that both populations showed essential no intrinsic scatter .",
    "clearly issues of luminosity and morphology must be addressed before we can fully understand the evolution of the galaxy populations of clusters .",
    "central to this understanding will be further work on classifying samples of faint galaxies in @xmath2700.3 clusters , these will enable us to robustly track the morphological evolution of this population ( couch et al .",
    "1997a ) .",
    "the fate of the blue , star - forming galaxies in these distant clusters is more speculative .",
    "these are typically low luminosity systems ( @xmath271 ) , exhibiting relatively modest star - formation .",
    "we illustrate one possible evolutionary pathway , which the population would follow if their star - formation was terminated at @xmath76 , this produces a population of faint , red galaxies in local clusters with a steep luminosity distribution .",
    "these characteristics are similar to those of the dwarf elliptical population which dominates local clusters at faint magnitudes ( bst ) .",
    "recent spectroscopic observations of similar objects in a cluster at @xmath272 has shown them to have very low masses ( koo et al .",
    "1997 ) and so we caution that these low luminosity galaxies may be be quite fragile and hence the cluster environment could have a significant impact on their luminosity and morphological evolution through dynamical processes ( moore et al .",
    "if substantial amounts of baryonic material are removed from late - type galaxies during their accretion onto the clusters we would expect this material to be deposited into the cluster potential as either intracluster gas or intracluster light .",
    "tracing the evolution of these components within rich clusters at @xmath150.5 may provide the most direct test of the stripping and harassment mechanisms ( moore et al .",
    "1997 ) .    in conclusion",
    ", there is a growing body of evidence which indicates that the passive red galaxy populations in local clusters are produce by a diverse range of processes .",
    "the most luminous elliptical galaxies appear to have formed at very early epochs ( @xmath52 , ellis et al .",
    "1997 ) , while the bulk of the s0 population have come into being much more recently ( @xmath273 , dressler et al .",
    "1997 ) as may the lower luminosity dwarf ellipticals ( koo et al .",
    "1997 ) . by combining the galaxy samples from our uniform survey of clusters we have identified a class of galaxies in our distant clusters which would have characteristics similar to those of the s0 population at low redshift , but which still show residual traces of star - formation , consistent with their being previously more active .",
    "determining the morphologies of a large sample of these objects in intermediate redshift clusters using hst will provide a strong test of their relationship to both the butcher - oemler populations of distant clusters and the local s0s ( c.f .",
