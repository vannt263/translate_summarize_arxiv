    "signal processing , at its most fundamental level , concerns the extraction of information ( signal ) from a system under various constraints .",
    "typically , communication engineers consider the signal as being embedded in noise , and although the signal may have spatial , temporal or bandwidth constraints , they are usually concerned with noise as the limiting factor . in the following work , we will consider a fundamental limit to signal extraction without impediments due to noise .",
    "we shall pose the following question :    given a signal ( wavefield ) which has energy in one volume @xmath0 , how well can we constraint that signal to have energy in _ another _ volume @xmath1 ?",
    "this question motivates examination of _ uncertainty principles _ ( up s ) .",
    "we may regard uncertainty as a basic limit on signal information extraction , without requiring a model for noise  since any noise can only further hinder our efforts .",
    "uncertainty principles have gained great popularity since heisenberg .",
    "the famous example is heisenberg s uncertainty principle : it is impossible to exactly measure the location _ and _ momentum of a particle simultaneously .",
    "this is a special case of a more general framework , which may be applied ( via various hilbert space techniques ) to a range of scenarios .    in a communication theory",
    "setting , a similar up has been well known : that a signal can not be arbitrarily confined in both time and frequency .",
    "the reader is directed to @xcite for a discussion .",
    "the work of @xcite has formalised this result , although without explicit reference to the operator theoretic nature of the problem . the time - bandwidth concept of a temporal signal provides us with a great deal of intuition and we shall draw heavily on the classic works .",
    "there is a significant distinction between _ essential dimensionality _ results such as  @xcite and _ uncertainty _ results  @xcite .",
    "dimensionality results ( eg . @xmath2 ) may be seen as a counting of the number of degrees of freedom a signal ( or function ) has within a particular set of constraints  much like the rank of a matrix .",
    "uncertainty tells us to what extent a signal will achieve all constraints , and how uniquely that solution is specified by the constraints .",
    "the remainder of this paper is arranged as follows : in section  [ classup ] we collate classic results in uncertainty and formulate up s in terms of operator theoretic forms .",
    "section  [ comms ] develops an uncertainty principle for communication between volumes with a particular form of operator channel .",
    "we provide a free - space example .",
    "conclusions are drawn , and proofs are consigned to the appendix .",
    "before explaining the uncertainty principle , we develop some relevant notation .      following selig  @xcite ,",
    "let @xmath3 be a hilbert space with inner product @xmath4 and norm @xmath5 .",
    "further , let @xmath6 be a linear operator with domain @xmath7 and range in @xmath3 .",
    "we then define the normalised expectation value , @xmath8 and standard deviation ( uncertainty ) , @xmath9 of the operator @xmath6 with respect to @xmath10 to be  @xcite @xmath11 the adjoint of operator @xmath6 , @xmath12 is defined using the following equation  @xcite @xmath13 furthermore , @xmath6 is said to be hermitian or self - adjoint if @xmath14 . for a self - adjoint operator @xmath15 any operator that obeys equation  [ seladj ] is said to be symmetric",

    "operators @xmath6 and @xmath16 are said to _ commute _ with each other if @xmath21 = 0 $ ] .",
    "otherwise they are called non - commutative operators .",

    "the angle between two non - zero functions @xmath28 and @xmath29 is defined as @xmath30 we also define @xmath31 to be the fourier transform of @xmath32 whenever this integral exists .",
    "the classical uncertainty principle states that the values of two non - commuting observers such as position and momentum can not be precisely determined in any quantum state . that is , the standard deviation of two non - commuting operators can not be made arbitrarily small simultaneously .",
    "the following theorem is a general statement of this phenomenon .",

    "if one defines @xmath50 and @xmath51 to be the measure of approximate time duration and bandwidth of the signal respectively , then theorem  [ th : uptf ] says that the product of time duration and bandwidth of a function is bounded from below by @xmath52 : if the time - spread gets very small , the frequency - spread must be large and vice - versa .",
    "though a good qualitative tool , this is inadequate for the purposes of signal processing . theorem  [ th : uptf ] does not answer the question : given a bandlimited function ( i.e. @xmath53 for @xmath54 $ ] ) how much of the energy of @xmath28 is ` concentrated ' in finite duration of time .",
    "this would be useful in answering the question : `` given a bandlimited channel , how much of the transmitted signal can a receiver measure over a finite period of time ? ''",
