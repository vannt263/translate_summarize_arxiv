    "<S> in an effort to explore the differences between rare - earth - based and uranium - based heavy fermion ( hf ) compounds that reflect the underlying difference between local 4@xmath0 moments and itinerant 5@xmath0 moments we analyze scaling laws that relate the low temperature neutron spectra of the primary ( `` kondo - esque '' ) spin fluctuation to the specific heat and susceptibility . while the scaling appears to work very well for the rare earth intermediate valence compounds , for a number of key uranium compounds the scaling laws fail badly . </S>",
    "<S> there are two main reasons for this failure . </S>",
    "<S> first , the presence of antiferromagnetic ( af ) fluctuations , which contribute significantly to the specific heat , alters the scaling ratios . </S>",
    "<S> second , the scaling laws require knowledge of the high temperature moment degeneracy , which is often undetermined for itinerant 5@xmath0 electrons . by making plausible corrections for both effects , </S>",
    "<S> better scaling ratios are obtained for some uranium compounds . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that while both the uranium hf compounds and the rare earth intermediate valence ( iv ) compounds have spin fluctuation characteristic energies of order 5 - 25 mev , they differ in that the af fluctuations that are usually seen in the u compounds are never seen in the rare earth iv compounds . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the 5f itineracy increases the f - f exchange relative to the rare earth case .    </S>",
    "<S> there are two categories of excitation seen in neutron scattering in paramagnetic heavy fermion compounds . </S>",
    "<S> a `` primary '' spin fluctuation gives rise , when excited , to the high temperature moment . </S>",
    "<S> such an excitation , whose spectrum is typically a broadened lorentzian , is seen in all such compounds , from moderately heavy intermediate valence ( iv ) compounds to very heavy fermion ( vhf ) compounds . </S>",
    "<S> the latter compounds typically reside close to a quantum critical point ( qcp ) for a t = 0 transition to a magnetic state , where magnetic fluctuations representing critical scattering close to the phase transition also occur.@xcite in this situation , scaling laws connect the behavior of the critical fluctuations to that of the specific heat and susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> these scaling laws have a different form for a qcp governed by `` local '' criticality as compared to the critical behavior of a magnetic instability in a fermi liquid.@xcite    one of the oldest - known properties of vhf and iv materials , whether in uranium or in rare earth ( re ) compounds , is the existence of a scaling law whereby the low temperature susceptibility @xmath1 and specific heat coefficient @xmath2 vary with the inverse @xmath3 of the characteristic energy @xmath4 of the primary spin fluctuation.@xcite the latter quantity can be equated to the maximum @xmath5 in the dynamic susceptibility @xmath6 , measured through inelastic neutron scattering . </S>",

    "<S> one of our purposes is to see whether there are differences between the scaling behavior of 4__f _ _ and 5__f _ _ heavy fermion materials due to the distinction between local and itinerant @xmath0 electrons .    the kondo / anderson impurity model results in very precise scaling laws , but assumes localized electrons . since we are concerned with the applicability of scaling to itinerant 5@xmath0 electrons , we need to stress that the low temperature scaling laws follow from very general considerations </S>",

    "<S> the moment is excited ; at low temperatures , the moment `` freezes out '' and the system is nonmagnetic .    a phenomenology of the scaling can be obtained by making several simplifying approximations . </S>",
    "<S> the spin excitation at @xmath5 will give rise to a peak in the specific heat at a temperature @xmath24 that is similar to a schottky peak , with the exception that @xmath25 is linear at low temperature for heavy fermion compounds . </S>",
    "<S> ( this linearity is related to the substantial breadth of the excitation . ) </S>",
    "<S> if we assume that @xmath25 is linear for @xmath26 , that half the @xmath27 entropy is generated between @xmath28 0 and @xmath24 , and that @xmath24 is approximately equal to @xmath293 ( a statement that is true for both schottky anomalies and for the kondo specific heat ) , we then obtain @xmath30 3/2 @xmath27 for the scaling constant . </S>",
    "<S> if we further assume that the susceptibility has a van vleck - like form @xmath31 ( where @xmath32 is the free ion curie constant for total angular momentum @xmath33 ) then we obtain the value 2 @xmath34 for the wilson ratio @xmath35 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the scaling constants derived from this phenomenology can only be viewed as roughly approximate . </S>",
    "<S> the point of the exercise is that scaling laws with values similar to those of the k / aim ( table 1 ) are expected on very general grounds , even when the spin fluctuations arise in an itinerant system where the k / aim is not expected to be applicable . </S>",

    "<S> there are also several differences between the behavior of local moment rare earth - based and itinerant uranium - based heavy fermion compounds that can be deduced from this analysis . </S>",
    "<S> first , we note that the energy scale ( @xmath69 100 - 300 k ) for the spin fluctuations of the uranium heavy fermion compounds exhibited in table 2 is comparable to that of cerium or ytterbium intermediate valence ( iv ) compounds . </S>",
    "<S> however , the af fluctuations that are seen for most of these uranium compounds are _ never _ observed in the rare earth iv compounds , but only in very heavy fermion compounds with small @xmath70 10 k. it is also true that there is no correlation between the magnitude of the af contribution and @xmath9 for the uranium compounds . </S>",
    "<S> for example , ube@xmath48 , which has a fairly large characteristic energy ( 150k ) , shows a large af contribution to the specific heat , while upt@xmath18 , where @xmath9 is much smaller ( 60k ) , exhibits a smaller af contribution to @xmath25 and usn@xmath18 , for which @xmath71 60k , shows no obvious upturn or af contribution to @xmath25.@xcite a possible explanation of these discrepancies between rare earth and uranium compounds is that the itineracy of the 5__f _ _ electrons gives rise to an intersite exchange that is larger relative to the spin fluctuation energy in the 5__f _ _ compounds than in the 4__f _ _ hf compounds , and which bears no universal relation to @xmath9 .    from table 2 , it will be noted that the low temperature specific heat , susceptibility , and neutron characteristic energy ( and hence the low temperature scaling ) are very similar for ybfe@xmath7zn@xmath8 and uco@xmath7zn@xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we have recently@xcite compared the data@xcite for these two compounds to the predictions of the k / aim and shown that the theory works extremely well for the rare earth compound , but very poorly for the uranium compound . </S>",
    "<S> this disagreement undoubtedly also reflects the difference between local moment and itinerant behavior .    </S>",
    "<S> finally we point to the well - known fact that , unlike the rare earth case , well - defined crystal field excitations are almost never observed in uranium intermetallic compounds . </S>",
    "<S> what @xmath72 seen is what we have reported above : a broad excitation on the 5 - 25 mev scale , representing the primary spin fluctuation , and in some compounds low energy ( @xmath44 1 mev ) antiferromagnetic fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> we thus argue that the peak at @xmath5 seen in uranium compounds represents spin fluctuations in an itinerant 5@xmath0 band .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion , we have proposed an approach that , while not highly precise , allows for separation of the contribution of the af fluctuations to the specific heat , thereby giving reasonable values for the kondo - esque scaling constants . </S>",
    "<S> the low values ( 10 - 17 ) of the scaling constant @xmath36 observed in some uranium hf compounds arise from the low degeneracy of the high temperature moment , which is also reflected in values of the curie constant which are small compared to the hund s rule values . </S>",
    "<S> this low degeneracy is a consequence of the itineracy of the 5@xmath0 electrons .    </S>",
    "<S> the results allow us to formulate a line for future research : first , the quantities @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and both @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( the primary and antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations ) should be measured in a single crystal of a given compound . the spectral weight of these two contributions to the magnetic neutron scattering </S>",
    "<S> should then be correlated with the fractional entropy of each contribution to the specific heat . </S>",
    "<S> second , the absolute cross section of the primary spin fluctuation should be measured and the appropriate sum rule used to see whether the integrated scattering corresponds to the high temperature moment seen in the susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> third , the primary spin fluctuation needs to be measured on single crystals of more uranium compounds in an effort to clarify the q - dependence of this excitation in the coherent state .    </S>",
