    "improved methods for studying the regime of small quark mass in lattice qcd provide the realistic prospect of quantitatively determining the parameters of the low energy chiral lagrangian of qcd from first principles . although a definitive comparison with experiment requires the analysis of full and/or partially quenched simulations , detailed studies of chiral behavior in the quenched approximation are of interest for several reasons .",
    "first , the characteristic quenched chiral loop effects which arise from the anomalous double - pole structure of the quenched , flavor - singlet pseudoscalar propagator will also occur in partially quenched calculations ( at a level determined by the mismatch between valence and sea quark masses)@xcite . the observation of these anomalous effects in the quenched theory should provide a useful baseline for future chiral analysis of full qcd .",
    "second , although it is not a unitary theory , the quenched approximation can be analyzed in an effective lagrangian framework , yielding a well - defined set of low - energy constants in quenched chiral perturbation theory .",
    "( in practice , this requires the assumption that the @xmath11 breaking from the anomaly can also be treated perturbatively ) .",
    "comparison of these constants with those of full qcd can provide valuable insight into the role of closed quark loops in hadron phenomenology .",
    "in addition , the study of chiral behavior in the quenched approximation provides useful information about the interplay between topological charge and chiral symmetry breaking in qcd .",
    "for example , the witten - veneziano formula relates the gluonic component of the @xmath12 mass in full qcd to the topological susceptibility of the quenched theory .    in two previous papers",
    "@xcite we reported results of a study of the chiral behavior of scalar and pseudoscalar meson propagators in quenched qcd at @xmath13 using clover improved wilson fermions . in this paper we present results from a new data set at @xmath14 @xcite ,",
    "compare them with the @xmath13 results , and summarize the main conclusions of this study .",
    "we also compare our results to those of other recent studies.@xcite an important ingredient in our analysis is the use of the mqa pole - shifting procedure @xcite to resolve the exceptional configuration problem . our experience with this technique has led us to conclude that it provides a practical and quantitatively acceptable resolution of the problem , which eliminates the spurious statistical fluctuations of exceptional configurations without systematically biasing the final results .",
    "this conclusion is based on the consistency between the light - quark results and those of heavier quarks where the pole - shifting has a negligible effect on the propagators .",
    "it is also supported by the overall agreement we observe between our results ( in and out of the pole region ) and theoretical expectations based on quenched chiral perturbation theory .",
    "( see section 6 )    since the introduction of the mqa procedure , other methods for avoiding the exceptional configuration problem have been explored .",
    "these include twisted - mass qcd @xcite and the use of exactly chiral ( overlap @xcite or domain - wall @xcite ) fermions .",
    "all these approaches have in common the fact that wilson - dirac eigenvalues at positive real quark mass are eliminated , thus resolving the problem .",
    "it should be noted that exactly real eigenmodes of the wilson - dirac operator , which are the cause of the exceptional configuration problem , make a negligible contribution to physical quantities in the infinite volume limit ( vanishing like @xmath15 ) .",
    "thus any prescription which effectively removes these poles from the physical region should provide a satisfactory resolution of the problem for sufficiently large volume .",
    "the mqa pole shifting is a minimal prescription for accomplishing this .",
    "a more stringent test of the procedure is the study of chiral behavior for very light quarks in a _",
    "finite _ volume which is large compared to the qcd scale but comparable to the chiral scale . in this regime , finite volume effects are large but calculable in @xmath16 , simply by replacing loop integrals by finite - volume momentum sums .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the scalar , isovector ( valence ) meson propagator exhibits a prominent quenched chiral loop effect arising from the @xmath12-@xmath17 intermediate state . for the lightest quark masses we study ,",
    "the finite volume effects expected from @xmath16 are quite large .",
    "thus , the detailed agreement ( as a function of both time and pion mass ) between the measured scalar propagator and the _ finite - volume _ one - loop calculation provides a convincing demonstration that the mqa procedure is an effective method for exploring the light quark regime with wilson fermions .",
    "to analyze the quenched theory in a chiral lagrangian framework , one introduces wrong - statistics ghost quark fields to cancel closed loops , yielding a low - energy chiral lagrangian with a graded @xmath18 symmetry . at the one - loop level , this is equivalent to the simpler and more direct approach to quenched @xmath19 @xcite which begins with an ordinary @xmath20 chiral lagrangian describing a nonet of goldstone bosons . to leading order ,",
    "this is @xmath21\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is a @xmath20 chiral field and @xmath23 is the pseudoscalar mass matrix .",
    "our analysis also incorporates the following fourth - order terms in the chiral lagrangian @xcite , @xmath24 the effect of the axial u(1 ) anomaly is introduced as an explicit symmetry breaking term consisting of a flavor - singlet pseudoscalar @xmath12 mass term and a field renormalization , @xmath25 where @xmath26 finally , we will also analyze the scalar , isovector meson propagator , which turns out to be well - described by a combination of a heavy @xmath8 meson and an @xmath12-@xmath17 loop diagram .",
    "thus , we incorporate a scalar - isovector meson field , using the formalism of nonlinear chiral lagrangians @xcite , @xmath27 where d is a chirally covariant derivative .",
    "one of our motivations for studying the scalar correlator is the expectation of a prominent quenched chiral loop effect from the @xmath12-@xmath17 intermediate state , as discussed in ref .",
    "the agreement between the lattice correlator and the one - loop calculation is very good , particularly for the @xmath14 results , as discussed in section 6 .    to summarize ,",
    "the low energy chiral lagrangian used in our analysis is @xmath28 in the quenched approximation , we have the supplementary rule that multiple @xmath12 mass insertions on a given pseudoscalar line are excluded . more generally , any @xmath19 diagram corresponding to a quark - line diagram with internal closed loops is discarded @xcite . at the one - chiral - loop level , these rules are unambiguous , and equivalent to the more systematic procedure of introducing ghost fields .",
    "the calculations discussed in this paper were carried out on the fermilab acpmaps and on the uva linux cluster garcia .",
    "the two monte carlo gauge ensembles analyzed consisted of 300 configurations at @xmath0 on a @xmath29 lattice , and 350 configurations at @xmath14 on a @xmath30 lattice ( the fermilab b and c ensembles ) .",

    "the clover coefficients used were @xmath31 for @xmath0 and @xmath32 for @xmath14 . for @xmath0 , the quark propagators were calculated for @xmath33 and .1428 , with @xmath34 , while for @xmath14 , propagators were calculated with @xmath35 and .1397 , with @xmath36 . in physical units , this corresponds to a range of pion masses of 275 to 565 mev for @xmath0 and 330 to 665 mev for @xmath14 . here and elsewhere",
    ", we will quote results in physical units using the rho mass to set the scale .",
    "an analysis of smeared and local rho propagators on our ensembles yields @xmath37 and @xmath38 for @xmath0 and @xmath14 , respectively .",

    "the resulting physical mass for the @xmath39 ( @xmath44 mev for @xmath0 and @xmath45 mev for @xmath14 ) is close to the mass of the observed @xmath46 resonance .",
    "to get some idea of the systematic error associated with choice of scale , we will sometimes quote equivalent results using the charmonium 1s-1p splitting scales of 1.18 gev and 1.80 gev for the two ensembles .",
    "the mqa pole - shifting procedure @xcite was applied to all quark propagators . for @xmath0 , all poles below @xmath47 were located and shifted , while for @xmath14 , all poles below @xmath48 were shifted .",
    "we begin by determining the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the term @xmath49 , eq . ( [ eq : hairpin ] ) .",

    "this analysis demonstrated a remarkable absence of excited state contamination in the hairpin correlator , even when the sources were only separated by one or two time slices .",
    "moreover , the time - dependence of @xmath59 was well - described at all times @xmath60 by the formula ( [ eq : dipole ] ) with @xmath61 , i.e. by a pure momentum - independent mass insertion . for the present analysis",
    ", we have fit both the 5.7 and 5.9 ensembles to the full two - parameter formula ( [ eq : dipole ] ) in order to obtain an accurate estimate of @xmath5 .",
    "for the 5.7 ensemble , acceptable @xmath62 s were obtained by fitting a range of times from @xmath63 to 12 . using the fully correlated error matrix , the covariant @xmath62 for these fits ranged from 0.8 to 1.5 per degree of freedom . for the hairpin correlators at @xmath64",
    ", we obtained very good fits to the formula ( [ eq : dipole ] ) over the entire time range from @xmath65 to 16 . here the correlated @xmath62 s ranged from 0.3 to 0.5 per degree of freedom .",

    "the values for different @xmath67 s within each ensemble are highly correlated , so the deviation of @xmath5 from zero in either data set has little statistical significance . ignoring @xmath67-dependence and averaging the values within each ensemble , we get @xmath68 and @xmath69",
    "if we ignore any possible lattice spacing dependence and average the two data sets in quadrature , we get the final result @xmath70 this can be regarded as a success of the large-@xmath71 view of the anomaly where this renormalization is an order @xmath72 effect . in the subsequent analysis",

    "first , our data uses somewhat coarser lattices and an independent determination of the clover coefficient .",
    "this could affect the comparison with the alpha analysis although they see little lattice spacing dependence in their data .",
    "there are also differences in methodology .",
    "our results are obtained from a linear fit to @xmath74 where the value of @xmath6 is determined from the dimensionless product of the slope and the intercept of the fit .",
    "this method is insensitive to physical scale parameter but is quite sensitive to the value of the axial - vector renormalization constant , being proportional to @xmath75 . in the context of the tadpole renormalization scheme @xcite our results in eqs .",

    "we note that , in our results , the mass dependence of the tadpole renormalization factor contributes about 17% to the slope of @xmath74 . for linear extrapolations of @xmath74",
    "the above method is actually exactly equivalent to the alpha ratio method with the inclusion of the correction factor ( eq . [ eq : corrs ] ) .    in the alpha procedure ,",

    "in view of the agreement we see on a single size box over a wide range of pion masses , we would expect the chiral loop diagram to also give a good description of the finite volume dependence , as long as the box is still large compared to the qcd scale .",

    "<S> the results of a high - statistics study of scalar and pseudoscalar meson propagators in quenched lattice qcd are presented . for two values of lattice spacing , @xmath0 ( @xmath1 fm ) and @xmath2 ( @xmath3 fm ) , we probe the light quark mass region using clover improved wilson fermions with the mqa pole - shifting ansatz to treat the exceptional configuration problem . </S>",
    "<S> the quenched chiral loop parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 are determined from a study of the pseudoscalar hairpin correlator . from a global fit to the meson correlators , estimates are obtained for the relevant chiral lagrangian parameters , including the leutwyler parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 . using the parameters obtained from the singlet and nonsinglet pseudoscalar correlators , the quenched chiral loop effect in the nonsinglet scalar meson correlator is studied . by removing this qcl effect from the lattice correlator , we obtain the mass and decay constant of the ground state scalar , isovector meson @xmath8 .     </S>",
