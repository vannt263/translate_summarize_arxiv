    "interaction of galaxies is a way to reveal extended gas around galaxies , that could stay cold and dark in quiescent phases .",
    "the hypothesis that the baryonic dark matter around galaxies could be cold h@xmath0 clouds has been developped in recent years , in different models .",
    "the cold clouds could be rotationally supported , orbiting in the outer parts of the galaxies in a flaring plane , associated to the hi gas ( pfenniger et al 1994 , pfenniger & combes 1994 ) .",
    "they are distributed in a fractal structure , with the smallest fragments ( the clumpuscules ) having a mass m @xmath1 m@xmath2 , a molecular density n@xmath3 @xmath4 , and a radius r @xmath5 10 au .",
    "alternatively , the cold h@xmath0 gas could be associated to brown dwarfs in clusters , distributed in the galactic halo , or spheroidal component ( de paolis et al 1995 ; gerhard & silk 1996 )",
    ". their temperature would then be higher ( t= 20k ) .",
    "these clumps are seen in ese ( extreme scattering events ) in front of quasars and in hi- vlbi in absorption against extended radio - sources ( fiedler et al 1987 , walker & wardle 1998 , faison et al 1998 ) .",
    "the statistics of observations are compatible with a large number of these clumps in the galaxy , so that the total mass could be comparable to that of the visible milky way .    the existence of this cold h@xmath0 gas has also been invoked to explain the extra-@xmath6 rays detected by egret , on board gro ( de paolis et al . 1999 ,",
    "sciama 1999 ) and some observational consequences have been studied ( combes & pfenniger 1997 , shchekinov 1999 ) .",
    "cooling flows in clusters could also form these clumpuscules ( ferland et al 1994 ) .",
    "let us recall that the visible matter in the universe corresponds to only @xmath7 0.003 , while the big bang nucleosynthesis implies that the baryonic density is @xmath8 0.01 @xmath9 , or that @xmath10 .",
    "most of the baryons are therefore dark , and the machos can not be a significant part of them , according to the microlensing experiments .",
    "the most striking feature in interacting galaxy groups is the presence of large tidal tails of matter dragged out of the galaxies , huge hi extensions with respect to the optical systems .",
    "yun et al . (",
    "1993 ) have found large quantities of hi all around the m81/m82/ngc 3077 system , and hibbard ( 1995 ) shows in his thesis an evolving sequence of interacting / merging galaxies , where the hi extensions are conspicuous .",
    "more precisely , the percentage of the total hi found in the tails / extensions is increasing with the merging stage , from 20% in the m81 system , to 80% in the merger remnant ngc 7252 .",
    "this does not mean that most of the gas will be expelled from interacting systems .",
    "in fact , with all probability , the gas dragged out remains bound to the system , and will rain back onto the merger remnant , after some billion years .",
    "hibbard et al .",
    "( 1994 ) show that the gas at the bottom of the tails in ngc 7252 is infalling .    in normal galaxies , large hi extents are very rare ( briggs et al 1980 , broeils 1992 , hoffman et al 1996 ) . in average",
    "the gas extent is r@xmath11 2 r@xmath12 .",
    "only interacting systems show extended gas .",
    "what is seen in the molecular phase is just the contrary : apparently large h@xmath0 concentrations pile up at the galaxy nuclei in interacting systems . up to 50% of the dynamical mass",
    "could be under the form of molecular hydrogen in merging systems ( scoville et al .",
    "1991 ) , even when the the co / h@xmath0 conversion ratio is corrected to a minimum ( bryant & scoville 1999 , solomon et al 1997 ) .    in summary ,",
    "the observations suggest that the hi gas is dragged outwards , while the h@xmath0 gas is driven inwards , to be consumed in star formation .",
    "in fact these two tracers ( hi and co ) shed light on two aspects of the same gas component . in normal spiral galaxies , there exists a sharp cut - off in the hi line distribution ( 21 cm ) ( van gorkom et al 1991 , corbelli & salpeter 1993 ) ; it is interpreted as a ionizing front , due to photoionisation from the extragalactic background .",
    "hii is the third gas phase to take into account .",
    "while star formation is enhanced in interacting galaxies , this is not true in groups and clusters .",
    "this is mainly due to the stripping of the outer gas acting as reservoirs of fuel for star formation .",
    "the hi deficiency in compact groups is in average 3 ( williams & rood 1987 , williams et al 1991 , huchtmeier 1997 , oosterloo & iovino 1997 ) , and there is no significant co deficiency or enhancement ( boselli et al 1996 , leon et al 1997 , verdes - montenegro et al .",
    "the missing gas is heated by repeated interactions , and joins the coronal hot phase .",
    "rosat survey of 22 hcg ( ponman et al 1996 ) have revealed that 75% possess a diffuse hot gas .",
    "there appears to be a correlation between x - ray and spiral galaxy fraction ( pildis et al .",
    "1995 ) .      hot gas and its x - ray emission are the keys to follow the fate of gas in interactions .",
    "read & ponman ( 1998 ) have followed a merger sequence and found that the x - ray luminosity is enhanced by the interaction , although not as much as the fir luminosity .",
    "spatially , the x - ray emission is not correlated with tidal tails ; the hot gas is ejected in winds , powered by the central starbursts .",
    "the classical m82-type bipolar outflow is often replaced by unipolar outflows in violent mergers .    in merger remnants ( like in ngc 7252 )",
    "l@xmath13 falls down again .",
    "this is surprising since such remnants are bound to become classical ellipticals , which have more hot gas than spirals ( e.g. fabbiano , 1989 ) .",
    "how is done the transformation ? at the base of the tidal tails , in ngc 7252 , the hi is falling back , as revealed by its kinematics ( hibbard et al .",
    "1994 ) , but then stops suddenly .",
    "it is not replaced by h@xmath0 gas , that is concentrated much further in . it is likely that the returning gas is heated by shocks to form a hot gas halo .",
    "this will take a time - scale of the order of gyrs to form a genuine elliptical .    in small groups ,",
    "the hot gas is even more extended , up to 400 kpc ( davis et al .",
    "the amount of hot gas is such that 20 to 34% of the mass is baryonic .",
    "this can not be done by galactic winds ( ponman et al .",
    "1996 , mulchaey et al .",
    "about 75% of compact groups have detectable x - ray emission ( ponman et al 1996 ) .",
    "in small groups , the hot gas metallicity is low ( lower than in clusters ) . in the l@xmath13-t diagram",
    ", the compact groups occupy a special region , after a turn - over : they have less luminosity for a given temperature than would be expected from clusters ( cf fig . [ lx ] ) .",
    "this could be due to the influence of galactic winds , creating a hole in the center , while winds have no influence in clusters ( ponman et al 1996 ) .",
    "alternatively , the hot gas could be progressively heated , through interactions , and have not yet reached equilibrium in small groups .",
    "this would be the case if the hot gas comes from the cold molecular gas in outer parts of galaxies ( pfenniger & combes 1994 ) .",
    "in this hypothesis , what is the fate of the gas , and when do the cold gas clumps form ?",
    "after recombination ( @xmath14 ) , the largest masses to get non - linear are of @xmath15 m@xmath2 , and the jeans mass is @xmath16m@xmath17 .",
    "all masses between these two will collapse and decouple from expansion , but the structures at precisely the jeans mass collapse first .",
    "the masses correspond to typical @xmath18 giant molecular clouds .",
    "if cooling is efficient enough ( @xmath19 ) , the collapse is quasi - isothermal , and fragmentation occurs , since the jeans mass becomes smaller and smaller as the density increases ( e.g. , hoyle 1953 ) .",
    "fragmentation is limited by opacity , and the smallest fragments ( or clumpuscules ) , which are at the transition of being pressure supported , are today of the order of @xmath20 m@xmath2 , and their mass grows slowly , as @xmath21 or @xmath22 , with redshift .",
    "cooling might be a problem , since primordial gas is non - metallic , with no dust grains ; above @xmath23k the main coolant is atomic hydrogen ( by collisional excitation of ly@xmath24 ) , then vibration - rotation lines of molecular hydrogen take over until @xmath25k , because a significant quantity of h@xmath0 molecules forms through h@xmath26 and h@xmath27 .",
    "below 200k , hd is then more efficient .",
    "many groups have computed the physico - chemistry of the primordial gas , to determine the size of the first forming bound structures ( yoneyama 1972 ; hutchins 1976 ; carlberg 1981 ; palla et al .",
    "1983 ; lepp & shull 1984 ) .",
    "all of them have found that the cooling is indeed efficient , as soon as the redshift is below @xmath28 .",
    "we have studied in particular the recursive formation of fragments , as expected in a fractal structure of dimension d=1.7 ( which fixes the density as a function of sizes and masses ) .",
    "cooling in such a fractal is very efficient , as shown by the temperature curve , which quickly returns back to t@xmath29 of the background after virialisation ( cf fig .",
    "[ clump ] ) .",
    "very soon , the clumps are almost entirely molecular ( combes & pfenniger 1998 ) .",
    "after this efficient formation , most of the gas is not in favorable conditions for star formation .",
    "indeed , larger potential wells have not formed yet , and the density threshold is not reached .",
    "it is therefore likely that the gas will slowly accumulate in bigger potentials to form galaxies , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ scen ] . in the inner parts of these early galaxies , star formation",
    "can then begin .",
    "then galaxy interactions will stirr and heat the gas through shocks and gravitational perturbations .",
    "besides , interactions accelerate the angular momentum transfer : part of the hi gas is dragged outwards in tails . most of the gas is driven inwards , giving rise to huge nuclear starbursts ( and may be agn ) .",
    "galaxy evolution is highly accelerated .",
    "the cold gas that was settled around each galaxy is heated and virialised in the new common potential and might be visible through x - rays .",
