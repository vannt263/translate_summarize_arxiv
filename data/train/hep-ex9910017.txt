    "when the mass is even higher , the effect of lq can be described as an effective four - fermion interaction known as @xmath46 contact interaction ( ci ) .",
    "ci is an effective theory for physics at high mass scales in their approximation at the low - energy limit , and can represent not only heavy lqs but also a variety of models beyond sm such as new heavy vector bosons or composite models of fermions .",

    "depending on the chiral structure of the interaction , many ci models can be constructed and modify the @xmath50 cross section differently .",
