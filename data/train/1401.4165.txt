    "solid - electrolyte interphase ( sei ) films that passivate low voltage anode surfaces are important for lithium ion battery operations.@xcite these films arise from electrochemical reduction and subsequent breakdown of the organic solvent - based electrolyte , which is unstable under battery charging potentials . with the correct choice of electrolyte ,",
    "stable sei films are formed , blocking further electron transfer from the anode to the electrolyte , yet permitting lithium ( li@xmath2 ) transport .",
    "small amounts of additives are often added to the electrolyte to modify the structure and performance of sei films .",
    "additives may be particularly important for the next generation of anode battery materials like silicon ( si ) , tin , and other alloys .",
    "for example , si promises much higher lithium ion capacities than commercially used graphite anodes.@xcite however , si exhibits large volumetric expansion during li intercalation .",
    "this often results in cracking , leading to detachment of particles from each other@xcite and perhaps from sei films formed during previous cycles .",
    "there appears to be a need to continuously reform the sei layer after each cycle , leading to consumption of li@xmath2 .",
    "thus , in general , si anodes have not been sufficiently stable over hundreds of charge / discharge cycles to be useful for commercial automobile batteries .",
    "sei films on traditional graphite anodes yield less capacity fade , even though chemical compositions of sei films on the two materials appear similar.@xcite    recently , fluoroethylene carbonate ( fec , fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) was found to improve the cycling behavior of silicon electrodes in half cell configurations.@xcite electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed that fec - modified sei films on si yield lower li@xmath2 transfer resistance , while atomic force microscopy reported smoother sei surfaces .",
    "mass spectroscopy and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy techniques showed little evidence of c - f covalently - bonded motifs in the sei layers . beyond these broad areas of agreement , details of sei structure and composition reported by different groups",
    "there are discrepancies regarding whether fec increases the film thickness and lif composition , and regarding whether fec and vinylene carbonate ( vc ) have similar additive effects .",
    "oxalate@xcite and polycarbonate@xcite sei components are reported in some studies , but not others .",
    "closely related to sei chemical composition is the chemical mechanisms responsible for decomposition of fec .",
    "the sequence of covalent bond breaking , the propagation of reaction intermediates to form polymeric products ( if any ) , and the number of electrons transferred to reacting complexes at each stage have not been elucidated experimentally.@xcite the apparent absence of c - f bonds in the sei has prompted at least one experimental work to speculate that volatile fluorine - containing hydrocarbon components like c@xmath3h@xmath4f are removed as gas products before they can form sei films.@xcite another proposed mechanism involves the elimination of hydrogen fluoride ( hf ) from fec to form vinylene carbonate ( vc ) deriviatives.@xcite others have disputed this claim , citing observed differences between fec- and vc - derived sei films.@xcite    electronic structure modeling is an excellent complement to experimental analysis.@xcite while unlikely to yield the entire sequence of reactions and precise product branching ratios , modeling is useful for interrogating whether each proposed bond - breaking / making step is exothermic , has a sufficiently low free energy barrier , or whether it will be superceded by other reaction pathways .",
    "concerns about theoretical accuracy can be alleviated by using multiple density functional theory ( dft ) and quantum chemistry methods to cross - check predictions .",
    "the role of electrode surfaces in promoting / hindering sei film formation reactions can also be elucidated .",
    "many insightful and evocative modeling works on bare crystalline si bulk,@xcite surfaces@xcite and their interactions with lithium metal ( as li@xmath2 source ) have been published , but so far they have not focused on sei formation mechanisms .",
    "the si models used in these works also tend to be bare si surfaces , which can exist only under ultrahigh vacuum ( uhv ) , not electrochemical , conditions .",
    "our modeling effort focuses on the initial steps of fec decomposition , disputes the hf and ch@xmath3chf reaction pathways proposed in the literature , and reveals lower barrier reaction mechanisms .",
    "our work also explores subsequent sei - formation steps that can occur .",
    "the two types of model used here dovetails with the two regimes of sei film formation widely associated with ec / dimethyl carbonate ( dmc ) mixtures on graphite anodes and freshly cut metal surfaces.@xcite the initial step consists of fast , two - electron attack ; the later stage involves one - electron reduction of solvent or salt molecules .",
    "the latter dominates when electron tunneling / transfer through the half - formed sei layer slows down .",
    "this two - stage mechanism may be consistent with the two - layer sei structure revealed in experiments .",
    "an inorganic inner layer conducting li@xmath2 but blocking solvent and @xmath5 transport , and an outer porous organic layer penetrable by solvent molecules , have been demonstrated.@xcite note that as - formed sei films may further undergo chemical / electrochemical evolution during cycling .",
    "to model two-@xmath5 reactions , we use li@xmath6si@xmath7 model anodes with their ( 010 ) surfaces in direct contact with a liquid mixture of fec and ec .",
    "this surface is meant as a prototype to study the fast , two-@xmath5 electron transfer regime .",
    "it is meant to mimic battery charging - induced si cracking events that expose sei - free surfaces to the electrolyte .",
    "this can take place during the initial or subsequent charge cycles .",
    "the anode stochiometry is chosen to represent one of the strongly lithiated li - si crystalline phases,@xcite which are in turn models for disordered li - si alloys in cycled materials .",
    "unlike the more commonly studied li@xmath8si@xmath7 stoichiometry , the orthonormal unit cell of crystalline li@xmath6si@xmath7 exhibits three unequal lattice constants .",
    "this inequality facilitates lattice - matching to model oxide films on anode surfaces . rapid fec decomposition induced by two @xmath5 transfer",
    "is observed .",
    "one - electron decomposition of fec is examined using cluster - plus - dielectric models in the absence of the silicon electrode .",
    "such calculations were pioneered by balbuena and coworkers and are valid for reactions that take place in the bulk liquid region.@xcite    we also address the role played by silicon oxide .",
    "theoretical studies of silica and related oxides in the context of lithium - ion batteries have been conducted,@xcite but sei film formation reactions on those surfaces were not a focus .",
    "it may be argued that silicon anodes _",
    "should _ qualitatively differ from graphite with respect to initial sei formation . unlike graphite , silicon samples",
    "are generally covered with a native oxide layer about 20    thick .",
    "recent work demonstrated that sei films on cycled silicon anodes contains buried sio@xmath3 and/or lithium silicate derived from sio@xmath3.@xcite this dense oxide / silicate insulating layer may slow down @xmath5 transfer sufficiently during initial charging that the two - electron regime entirely vanishes.@xcite therefore a computational model that includes an electrode as well as a passivation oxide layer is also considered .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  2 briefly describes the computational methods .",
    "fec decompositions induced by two- and one - electron injections are described in sec .  3 and sec .  4 , respectively .",

    "6 concludes the paper with a brief summary .",
    "two appendices examine the reductive decomposition of fec adsorbed on lithium and silicon clusters using hybrid dft functionals , and report two - electron mechanisms similar to those described in the main text .",
    "finite temperature _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics ( aimd ) simulations are conducted under solvent - immersed electrode conditions to study two - electron - induced fec decomposition .",
    "these calculations are performed using the vienna atomic simulation package ( vasp ) version 4.6@xcite and the pbe density functional.@xcite a 400  ev planewave energy cutoff and a 10@xmath9  ev convergence criterion is applied at each born - oppenheimer time step .",
    "tritium masses on ec are substituted for protons to permit a time step of 1  fs .",
    "the trajectories are kept at an average temperature of t=450  k using nose thermostats .",
    "the elevated temperature reflects the need to `` melt '' ec , which has an experimental freezing point above room temperature , and to improve sampling efficiency.@xcite in real batteries dmc cosolvent molecules reduce the viscosity , but dmc is not included herein . as a result ,",
    "bond - breaking reactions observed in this work reflects accelerated kinetics pertinent to t=450  k.    several types of simulation cells are considered .",
    "one has dimensions 15.84@xmath1033.00@xmath1013.32@xmath11 and contains an apolar li@xmath12si@xmath13 slab with a zero dipole moment perpendicular to the exposed ( 010 ) surfaces .",
    "the bulk li@xmath6si@xmath7 structure is taken from ref .  .",
    "for that system , the ( 010 ) surface is found to be among the lowest energy low index surfaces.@xcite the vacuum gap between the exposed surfaces is filled with 32  ec molecules , which are pre - equilibrated using monte carlo simulations with the towhee monte carlo code , and simple molecular force fields described in earlier works.@xcite then 8 of the 32 ec molecules at the electrode surfaces are replaced with fec and monte carlo is resumed for 5000 passes .",
    "this spatial distribution of molecules faciliates fec decomposition over ec .",
    "finally , aimd is initiated using 2@xmath101@xmath102-point brillouin zone sampling . during experimental preparation of battery cells ,",
    "the voltage is lowered slowly .",

    "( see however ref .   for an alternate interpretation . )",
    "strict voltage control is lacking in these aimd simulations,@xcite which are meant to mimic post - li@xmath0si@xmath1 cracking during cycling conditions , not electrode preparation .",
    "thus , we have used spatial variations in additive compositions to enhance preferential fec decomposition . in vasp calculations ,",
    "the bader decomposition technique is applied to determine the net charge on fec fragments.@xcite    another simulation cell has the same li - si alloy anode and liquid electrolyte , but includes a @xmath14   thin , stoichiometric li@xmath7sio@xmath7 layer on each electrode surface .",

    "the excess @xmath5 is found to be successfully localized on the fec molecule .",
    "static cluster - based , static optimization calculations apply dft / pbe and mller - plesset second order perturbation ( mp2 ) in conjunction with the gaussian ( g09 ) suite of programs@xcite and the `` smd '' dielectric continuum approximation.@xcite the dielectric constant @xmath17 is set to 40 , which approximates the environment of the entire battery electrolyte , not just liquid ec .",
    "geometry optimization is performed using the 6 - 31+g(d , p ) basis set .",
    "single point energies are computed at the 6 - 311++g(3df,2pd ) level of theory .",
    "vibrational frequencies are calculated for stable structures and transition states using the smaller basis , yielding zero point energies and thermal corrections to electronic energies .",
    "the dft / pbe functional is chosen to complement aimd / pbe simulations in this work , and the mp2 method is picked to be consistent with mp2 calculations in one of the authors previous work@xcite and other modeling effort in the literature.@xcite both ( ec)@xmath3fec@xmath16:li@xmath2 and fec@xmath16:li@xmath2 clusters are considered .",
    "the larger cluster is chosen to reflect a previous aimd prediction that li@xmath2 is coordinated to slightly more than 3  ec molecules in ec liquid if one ec contains an excess electron.@xcite    hybrid dft functionals@xcite are used for studies of fec : li@xmath18 and fec : li@xmath2:si@xmath19h@xmath8 clusters .",

    "no hf or ch@xmath3chf is released , contrary to mechanisms proposed in the literature.@xcite by the nature of the simulation , the decomposition reactions observed are not imposed by any assumption , but are the natural manifestations of low - barrier mechanisms .    along this trajectory , after another 5.6  ps , two ec and another fec molecule on the surfaces decompose ( not shown ) .",
    "the two ec molecules absorb two @xmath5 each to form co / c@xmath3h@xmath7o@xmath26 and c@xmath3h@xmath7/co@xmath27 , as has been observed on li@xmath2 intercalated graphite edges.@xcite",

    "the r - cho@xmath16 functional groups of the organic anionic fragments ( fig .",

    "appendix  b also shows that a 2-@xmath5 induced co@xmath27-releasing fec reaction is exothermic but exhibits a high barrier when computed on a si - cluster .",
    "unlike ec@xmath28,@xcite we have been unable to stabilize intact fec@xmath28 molecular structures in a cluster geometry .",
    "fec@xmath28:li@xmath2 complexes always spontaneously decomposes , whether a dielectric continuum treatment is used or not .",
    "hence no cluster - based calculation of fec@xmath28 bond - breaking barrier / reduction potential or direct comparison with aimd / pbe reaction timescales following 2-@xmath5 reduction of intact fec molecules can be made .",
    "we have made a preliminary attempt at modeling 1-@xmath5 attacks on fec in the presence of a li@xmath30si@xmath7 electrode , with each surface coated with a 7   thick li@xmath7sio@xmath7 layer so that the fec liquid is no longer in contact with li@xmath6si@xmath7 surfaces ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]f ) .",
    "two fec are decompose in picosecond time scales . despite the expectation that the oxide should slow down electron transfer and enhance 1-@xmath5 attack on fec over 2-@xmath5 reduction",
    ", bader charge decomposition analysis shows that the products are still consistent with 2-@xmath5-induced reactions .",
    "the reason for 2-@xmath5 attack may be twofold .",
    "( 1 ) the reduction potentials may favor double reduction of fec , as in the case for ec.@xcite the proximity of the metallic electrode means that the dielectric constant at high frequencies remains large .",
    "high @xmath31 means that reorganization energies for both one and two @xmath5 transfer to fec may be low , and therefore electron transfer through the oxide is fast . if that is indeed the case , two electron attack is the correct prediction .",
    "( 2 ) however , aimd / pbe overestimates @xmath5 tunneling rate due to dft / pbe delocalization errors . this tendency has been discussed in ref .  .",
    "thus , 2-@xmath5 attack on oxide - covered anode may be an incorrect dft prediction .",
    "hybrid dft functionals , less susceptible to dft delocalization errors , may be used to study this system in the future , although they are costly to use in the periodically replicated simulation cells discussed in this section . in the next sections ,",
    "1-@xmath5 mechanisms are imposed by adding one excess @xmath5 to model systems in the absence of an electrode .",
    "an aimd trajectory of 31  ec , 1  fec , 1  li@xmath2 , and an excess @xmath5 in the simulation cell is considered next . by design , the excess @xmath5 resides on the fec molecule which is coordinated to the li@xmath2 , as discussed in sec .  [ method ] .",
    "after 5.3  ps , the initially intact fec@xmath16 breaks a c@xmath22-o@xmath23 bond , similar to the initial reaction step observed in most reactions on li@xmath30si@xmath7 surfaces ( fig .  [ fig1]e ) . a snapshot of this configuration is shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] .",
    "using a different force - field pre - equilibrated initial configuration , the same bond breaks after 16.0  ps ( not shown ) .",
    "the bond - breaking time scales are slightly different due to the stochastic nature of barrier crossing events .",
    "intuitively , c@xmath22-o@xmath23 bond - breaking should be favored over c@xmath22-o@xmath3 because the electron - withdrawing f - atom should stabilize the -chfo@xmath32 group . unlike two - electron - induced reactions described in the previous section , the c - f bond has not broken and the f@xmath16 has not yet detached from the fec@xmath16 in this trajectory .",
    "the reason for the intact c - f bond may be the lack of li@xmath2 in the proximity to abstract f@xmath16 and form a stable lif cluster .",
    "this point will be reiterated in light of cluster - based calculations described below .",
    "cluster - based predictions are depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig3]-[fig6 ] .",
    "first we consider the geometries of metastable fec@xmath16:li@xmath2 complexes prior to bond - breaking events .",
    "configurations * a*-*d * ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]a - d ) are somewhat analogous to the ec@xmath16:li@xmath2 geometry.@xcite the c@xmath22-o@xmath22 bond is bent out of the plane containing the 5-atom ring , like ec@xmath16 , but unlike charge neutral fec or ec , because the c@xmath22 atom is now sp@xmath11 ( or `` sp@xmath33 '' ) hybridized to accommodate an extra @xmath5 . unlike the more symmetric ec@xmath16:li@xmath2 , complex , there are four distinct binding geometries depending on whether li@xmath2 and f  reside in the same or opposite side of the 5-member ring , and whether they are on the same side of the bisecting plane perpendicular to the ring .",
    "another configuration , * e * ( fig .  [ fig3]e ) , finds li@xmath2 residing on the approximate bisector plane , only coordinated to o@xmath22 .",
    "all  5 configurations are close in energy , within 0.065  ev ( 0.042  ev ) of each other depending on whether mp2 ( pbe ) is used ( table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "configuration * a *  ( fig .  [ fig3]a ) is most stable according to the pbe functional . when mp2 is used , it is more stable than all other complexes except * d * ( fig .  [ fig3]d ) by a small 0.020  ev , which is within thermal energy of the mp2-predicted global minimum .",
    "given the fact that neither dft nor mp2 has attained chemical accuracy ( i.e. , a mean error of less than @xmath340.04  ev compared to experiments ) , we will henceforth use * a *  as the starting configuration of all further cluster - based degradation studies .",
    "the most important metrics are the barrier heights measured against the most stable intact fec@xmath16 configuration . a small uncertainty of @xmath340.02  ev in the energy of the starting , unreacted complex merely adds a small amount to barrier heights and does not change the qualitative conclusions .",
    "using configuration * a * to represent fec@xmath16:li@xmath2 , the predicted mp2 reduction potential of fec : li@xmath2 is 0.75  v , which is 0.22  v higher than that of ec : li@xmath2 based on a previous study at the same level of theory.@xcite this difference indicates that fec : li@xmath2 accepts an electron at higher voltages than ec : li@xmath2 .",
    "the experimental value appears to be @xmath34 0.95  v.@xcite as mentioned above , adding a second @xmath5 to the fec@xmath16:li@xmath2 cluster leads to immediate decomposition , and thus the reduction potential of intact fec@xmath16 can not be computed .",
    "if the dielectric continuum approximation is omitted , the c@xmath22-o@xmath23 bond in * a * spontaneously breaks during geometry optimization regardless of whether pbe or mp2 is used .",
    "the resulting structure is similar to * f * ( fig .  [ fig3]f , which is however optimized with a dielectric approximation , not in the gas phase ) .",
    "recall that the same bond spontaneously breaks in aimd simulations ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the same bond also breaks in * c * and *",
    "d * in the gas phase ( no dielectric ) during pbe optimization , while the c@xmath22-o@xmath3 bond does not .",
    "the next section focuses on decomposition initiated by c@xmath22-o@xmath23 bond - breaking .",
    "this subsection shows that the most probable ( one - eletron ) fec@xmath16 decomposition route is an indirect , multi - step reaction leading to removal of an f@xmath16 anion followed by release of co@xmath3 and an organic radical .",
    "bond - breaking barriers computed using the fec@xmath16:li@xmath2 cluster are listed in table  [ table2 ] , and the global free energy landscape is illustrated in fig .",
    "c@xmath22-o@xmath35 cleavage yields the lowest initial bond - breaking barrier , predicted using the mp2 ( pbe ) method to be 0.26  ev ( 0.23  ev ) .",
    "this forms intermediate * f * ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]f ) which is metastable by 0.09  ev ( stable by @xmath36  ev ) .",
    "the small ( @xmath37  ev ) discrepancies between mp2 and pbe barriers indicate that these reactions should be fast regardless of computational methods .",
    "a fast reaction rate is qualitatively consistent with the aimd trajectory ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) showing c@xmath22-o@xmath23 bond - breaking within picoseconds .",
    "next we consider possible subsequent steps .",
    "guided by 2-@xmath5 reactions ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]e ) , we next examine c - f bond cleavage that proceeds from * f *  to  * g * ( fig .  [ fig4]a ) .",
    "mp2 calculations reveal that the reaction is exothermic by 0.55  ev ( or 0.64  ev measured from the starting structure * a * , table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "the barrier from * f *  to  * g * is very small ( 0.12  ev , table  [ table2 ] ) .",
    "( using * f * as reference implies that * f *  is sufficiently thermalized following bond - breaking reaction from  * a*. ) the corresponding pbe values are 0.45  ev , 0.34  ev , and 0.26  ev , respectively .",

    "[ fig1]b ) is also thermodynamically and kinetically viable for singly reduced fec .",
    "compared with the aimd simulations depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the reason the c - f bond remains intact there seems to have mostly entropic origins .",
    "the lone li@xmath2 ion is far removed from the f atom in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , and a longer trajectory appears necessary for li@xmath2 to diffuse to and coordinate with the fluorine atom so the latter can detach from the fec@xmath16 fragment .    due to the reactive nature of partially decomposed fec@xmath16 ,",
    "numerous product channels and transition states exist for subsequent steps . in some cases",
    "the li@xmath2 and/or detached f@xmath16 ions are omitted to assist calculation of the specific barriers .",

    "unlike that case , co@xmath3 is predicted to be a biproduct which accompanies the release of uncharged organic radicals that may not form effective sei components .",

    "[ fig4]f ) which is endothermic by 0.20  ev ( 0.00  ev ) .",
    "no low barrier pathway for this two - bond - breaking reaction is found .",
    "so far , the results are derived using a cluster with one fec , plus a dielectric continuum that represents spectator solvent molecules . in experiments ,",
    "the solvent is often a combination of ec and dmc , with fec also present at low concentration . a more accurate way of representing the fec@xmath16:li@xmath2 solvation shell is to introduce more molecules .",
    "configurations * m*-*p * ( figs .  [ fig6]a - d ) depict optimized geometries when two extra ec are included in the li@xmath2 coordination shell . using the pbe functional , the most favorable intact fec configuration  * m * ( fig .",

    "[ fig6]b ) is analogous to * a * ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ) and is metastable , but by only 0.070  ev .",

    "configuration  * o * with a broken c@xmath22-o bond ( fig .",

    "* p * ( fig .  [ fig6]d ) is similar to * g * ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]c ) with a smaller release of free energy .",
    "* o * can not be optimized using the mp2 method ; it decomposes into * p * spontaneously .",
    "we have not computed barriers using these larger clusters .",
    "recall , however , that a c@xmath22-o@xmath23 bond breaks within 5.3  ps in aimd / pbe simulations that treat _ all _ solvation molecules explicitly ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this timescale is consistent with at most a 0.1  ev barrier .",
    "thus , depending on the electronic structure method , cluster size , and treatment of temperature and out - lying spectator ec molecules , c@xmath22-o@xmath23 bond breaking barriers vary from @xmath37  ev to a maximum of 0.26  ev .",
    "such estimated barriers are consistent with fec@xmath16 lifetimes that are much shorter than battery charge / discharge timescales .",
    "the main finding of this subsection is that using the smaller li@xmath2:fec@xmath16 complex may slightly overestimate reaction exothermicities .",
    "at least two requirements must be satisfied for good electrolyte additives : 1 ) they should react at voltages higher than electrolyte solvents / anions to ensure the sei film is dominated by their breakdown products ; 2 ) their reaction intermediates must also coalesce and/or further react to form sei films that effectively transmit li@xmath2 ions but block solvent and electron transport . li@xmath2-containing ionic solids made up of negatively charged species from additive / electrolyte decomposition are likely crucial for li@xmath2 transport .",
    "sei made of purely charge - neutral oligomer products which do not contain li@xmath2 are unlikely to conduct li@xmath2 efficiently , or for that matter become dense / compact enough to block solvent transport .",
    "hence , both prediction of reduction potentials and elucidation of decomposition pathways are needed to define computational screening criteria that lead to design of better additives.@xcite    from this perspective , two - electron products ( f@xmath16 and c@xmath4h@xmath4o@xmath25 ) appear reasonable sei components , although the latter contains x - cho@xmath16 groups that will likely undergo further reactions .",
    "dimerization is observed ; subsequent oligomerization may be possible . the most favorable sequence of one - electron reactions yields f@xmath16 , uncharged radicals , and co@xmath3 .",
    "this suggests that the 1-e@xmath16 route yields lif , found in the sei , and other uncharged organic products that , if they coaleasce , are likely neither very conductive to li@xmath2 nor form compact , effective sei films .",
    "however , it can not be ruled out that co@xmath3 and choch@xmath3@xmath39 can be further reduced electrochemically and then become part of the sei . indeed , co@xmath3 reduction may yield oxalate ( c@xmath3o@xmath7@xmath28 ) , as reported in some measurements.@xcite the likelihood of these subsequent events should depend on the relative rates of electron transfer through the nascent sei film and of preciptation / nucleation of charged fragments on the electrode surface .",
    "thus both 1- and 2-@xmath5 mechanisms lead to rapid release of f@xmath16 to form lif .",
    "we propose this is the main consequence of using fec as additive .",
    "lif can also arise from decomposition of pf@xmath44 , which is often considered not to be an electrochemical reduction , but is related to h@xmath3o contamination .",
    "hence fec may generate lif much more quickly .",
    "polycarbonates , suggested in some of the fec / si - anode literature,@xcite is not directly observed in fec@xmath45 decomposition . a previous computational work by one of the authors proposed polycarbonate chain formation from two - electron reduction of ethylene carbonate ( ec ) .",
    "such chains are predicted to be unstable in high dielectric environments , their roco@xmath3r motifs as prone to electrochemical reduction and c@xmath22-o and c@xmath38-o cleavage as ec itself .",
    "however , if polycarbonate chains form large aggregates , the dielectric constant may be sufficiently lowered that they are no longer susceptible to excess @xmath5 attacks .",
    "thus polycarbonates can not be ruled out even though the experimental evidence for their existence does not appear conclusive .",
    "we have also performed preliminary calculations of fec@xmath16 decomposition on lithium silicate - covered electrode surfaces immersed in liquid electrolyte .",
    "this mixed oxide is known to be present after cycling silicon anodes in lithium ion batteries .",
    "the thin ( @xmath14   ) insulator oxide layers intervening between the metallic li@xmath6si@xmath7 and the electrolyte yield two - electron fec decomposition reactions , and therefore appear not sufficiently thick to perform the necessary function of slowing down @xmath5 transfer sufficiently to limit fec decomposition to 1-@xmath5 reactions .",
    "we have used pbe , mp2 , and in one case , b3lyp methods to compute reaction barriers . in most cases the predictions are similar , within @xmath34@xmath46  ev of each other .",
    "the exception is breaking of the c@xmath38-o bond , where mp2(pbe ) appears to overestimate ( underestimate ) the true barrier ( see also appendix b ) .",
    "in conclusion , we have examined the decomposition mechanisms of fluoroethylene carbonate ( fec ) , which is a promising additive for improving passivating solid electrolyte interphase ( sei ) films on silicon anode surfaces in lithium ion batteries .",
    "various mechanisms are examined using unconstrained aimd simulations of explicit liquid electrolyte / li@xmath30s@xmath7 interfaces and using cluster - based calculations .",
    "the two types of simulations are consistent with two- and one-@xmath5 attack on fec , respectively .",
    "multiple reaction products and pathways are observed in fast 2-@xmath5 induced fec breakdown .",
    "the main products are carbon monoxide or its precursor , f@xmath16 anion , and negatively charged c- and o - containing fragments that may undergo further reactions .",
    "we also observe direct defluorination of `` fec@xmath28 , '' yielding a c@xmath4h@xmath4o@xmath25 fragment with an intact 5-atom ring which in turn initiates nucleophilic attack on a neighboring ec molecule .",
    "f@xmath16 can precipitate to form lif , which has been shown to be abundantly present in fec - derived sei films,@xcite while the negatively charged organic fragments can also contribute to the li@xmath2-conducting part of the sei .",
    "similar initial bond - breaking routes and f@xmath16 ion release are also found during 1-@xmath5 induced reactions .",
    "while reaction pathways and products have not been exhaustively enumerated , the first reaction is predicted to be the cleavage of the c@xmath22-o@xmath23 bond regardless of whether unbiased aimd / pbe simulation or cluster - based mp2/pbe barrier calculation is used .",
    "this internal consistency suggests that the predictions are reasonable .",

    "both one - electron and two - electron mechanisms are possible for decomposition of fec .",

    "the major binding site is the carbonyl o ( o@xmath22 ) and the li@xmath2 in configurations * 1 * and * 2*. * 1 * and * 2 * share similar geometries , and the only difference is the position of the f atom : one is toward the si(001 ) surface , whereas the other is away from the surface .",

    "the fec adsorption is slightly weaker than that in * 1 * and * 2 * , with an adsorption energy of -0.93  ev , suggesting that the o@xmath22-li@xmath2 interaction is stronger than f - li@xmath2 .",
    "the fec geometry shows little change in the adsorbed structures .",
    "the fec - li@xmath2-si@xmath8h@xmath19 cluster may receive one or two electrons before decomposition takes place , depending on the reduction potential , applied voltage , and electron transfer rate .",
    "our geometry optimization produces 7 stable structures for the one - electron transfer process .",
    "the most stable one , * 4 * , is obtained by adding an electron to and optimizing from configuration * 2 * , and the electron affinity ( ea ) is -5.46 ev . the geometry of the fec molecule is hardly changed in the process , implying no significant electron structure change of the adsorbed molecule .",
    "this is further verified by charge distribution analysis : most negative charge ( @xmath3487% ) fluxes into the si@xmath8h@xmath19 cluster , whereas the charge on the fec molecule remains roughly unchanged , as listed in table  [ table4 ] .",
    "thus , without the dielectric environment provided by the liquid electrolyte , the si@xmath8h@xmath19 cluster retains most of the negative charge , retarding fec decomposition .",
    "two - electron transfer reactions are also investigated and five stable structures are obtained after geometry optimization . the energetically most favorable structure is * 5 * generated by * 1 * + 2@xmath5 @xmath43 * 5 * ( combined first and second ea = -7.99 ev ) .",
    "the overall configuration of * 5 * differs substantially from * 1 * , in which the fec molecule is away from the cluster and the ring plane is approximately perpendicular to the si surface .",

    "the combined 1st and 2nd ea is -8.10  ev for * 3 * + 2 @xmath5 @xmath43 * 6*. in the electron transfer process , o@xmath22 moves away from the si surface .",
    "therefore , only one major binding site between the f - atom and the li atoms is found in * 6*. analogous to configuration * 4 * , most negative charge transfers to the si@xmath8h@xmath19 cluster in * 5 * and * 6*. however , there is significant ngative charge ( @xmath3484% ) flowing into the fec molecule .",
    "for example , the net charge of fec in * 5 * is @xmath51 in comparison to @xmath52 in 1 .",
    "next we examine the first step of bond dissociation for both one- and two - electron decomposition mechanisms .",

    "the lowest energy barrier is c@xmath55-o cleavage ( mode c ) , with a value of 0.43  ev .",
    "the intermediates usually have more binding site(s ) on the si surface , primarily via the o and c@xmath38 atoms .",

    "the reactions are more exothermic ( @xmath56  @xmath57  ev ) than those in one electron reactions . although bond - breaking mode a / d exhibits the most negative reaction energy , its high energy barrier ( 1.24  ev ) makes the bond cleavage kinetically less favorable .",
    "one the other hand , bond cleavages at b and c show very low energy barriers ( 0.11 and 0.28  ev ) .",
    "therefore , c@xmath22-o bond breakings via the two - electron mechanism are both thermodynamically and kinetically favorable on the li - si@xmath8h@xmath19 cluster .",
    "this is in full agreement with the aimd calculations .",
    "bond breaking at b leads to the formation of intermediate * 7 * , in which 3 binding sites , o@xmath22-li , c@xmath22-si , and o@xmath38-c , are observed ( fig .",

    "c - f bond breaking is also found in aimd simulations . in summary ,",
    "two electron mechanisms are favorable for fec reduction on the li - absorbed si cluster while one electron mechanisms are either endothermic or exhibit high barriers . whether one- or two - electron routes dominate depends on electron transfer processes , which are beyond the scope of this study .",
