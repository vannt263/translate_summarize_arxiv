    "this paper describes the design , implementation and testing of the microwave radiometers and support electronics incorporated in the microwave anisotropy probe ( _ map _ ) satellite .",
    "the _ map _",
    "mission is the second in nasa s medium - class explorers ( midex ) program @xcite .",
    "its purpose is to produce multi - frequency full sky maps of the microwave sky , from which maps of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) can be extracted .",
    "the design of _ map _ is the result of a detailed study which involved balancing the mission s three major interdependent performance requirements , angular resolution , sensitivity and systematic error suppression , while remaining consistent with the resources provided by midex program .",
    "some of the major design parameters which resulted are : angular resolution of @xmath0 ; minimally correlated pixel noise ; full sky coverage ; frequency coverage of @xmath1  in 5 bands ; polarization sensitivity ; calibration accuracy better than @xmath2 ; sensitivity of @xmath3 per @xmath4 sr / pixel .",
    "the _ map _ instrument is composed of 20 differential hemt based radiometers coupled to the sky by a set of back - to - back off axis gregorian optics .",
    "the optics and input stages of the radiometers are passively cooled by radiation to space .",
    "the angle subtended between the two input beams of each radiometer is @xmath5 .",
    "_ map _ observes from the second earth - sun lagrange point using a compound spin motion producing highly interconnected scan patterns on the sky .",
    "these patterns greatly facilitate reconstruction of the temperature maps from the measured differential signals while suppressing systematic errors .",
    "details of the entire mission , including diagrams of spacecraft and instrument layout and estimated uncertainties in the measured angular power spectra are presented in @xcite .",
    "control of possible sources of systematic errors ( features in the maps , other than random noise , which are not present on the sky ) was a high priority and greatly influenced many aspects of _ map _ s design .",
    "systematic errors can arise from several sources , including sidelobe pickup from foreground objects ( the sun , moon , earth and galaxy ) , instrument instabilities ( amplifier gain fluctuations , thermal drifts , etc . ) or the data processing used to convert the time ordered data into calibrated sky maps .",
    "careful optical design @xcite orbit selection , and a scan strategy that keeps most contaminating sources far from the lines of sight of the instrument were used to minimize sidelobe pickup of foreground objects .",
    "the data processing procedure was checked for possible systematic errors by processing simulated data sets through the entire data processing pipeline and comparing the outputs to the simulation inputs .",
    "instrumental effects include instabilities inherent in the radiometers and those caused by environmental changes to the instrument .",
    "intrinsic radiometer instabilities were minimized by the use of a differential radiometer design , the details of which are presented later in this paper .",
    "the entire observatory , comprising the instrument and spacecraft structure , was carefully designed to maintain as stable an environment as possible for the instrument .",
    "specific examples are the scan strategy , which maintains a constant angle of insolation on the observatory , thermal isolation of the instrument from the spacecraft bus , and the nearly constant spacecraft power dissipation , all of which minimize thermal disturbances which could influence instrument performance .",
    "a systematic error budget was established before the instrument build and estimates of contributions from all known potential signal sources were tracked throughout the program .",
    "signal sources were classified as either spin synchronous or random .",
    "random signals are those which are uncorrelated with orientation of the observatory .",
    "random signals tend to average to zero , only the residual terms contribute to errors in the final maps .",
    "spin synchronous signals , such as galactic pickup from side - lobes or radiometer drifts due to spin synchronous thermal fluctuations do not average to zero , and therefore must be limited to much smaller values in the time ordered data .",
    "_ map _ is designed to limit the magnitude of systematic errors signals to less than @xmath6  in the uncorrected sky maps .",
    "simulations indicate that spin synchronous artifacts in the time ordered data are suppressed by a factors of 2 or more by the map making algorithm given our scan pattern , so the corresponding allowed spin synchronous systematic error level in the time stream is @xmath7  . of this",
    "a @xmath8  contribution is budgeted for emission from cryogenic components in the feed horns and optical system , @xmath9  from the radiometers , data collection system , and supporting electronics , with the remainder allocated to emission sources external to the satellite picked up by the side - lobe response of the optical system .",
    "the _ map _ radiometers were designed to meet the systematic error requirement _ without applying any corrections _ to the radiometric data .",
    "the ultimate goal of these efforts is to produce high - quality sky maps with negligible striping along the scan directions and nearly diagonal pixel - pixel noise correlation matrices .",
    "_ map _ contains 20 differential radiometers covering 5 frequency bands .",
    "they are direct conversion radiometers ( no mixing to an intermediate frequency ) and share the same basic design .",
    "operation of the radiometers is similar to the continuous comparison radiometer described by @xcite .",
    "amplification is provided by high electron mobility transistor ( hemt ) amplifiers , with the input stages passively cooled to @xmath10  k to lower the system noise .",
    "the total microwave gain of each radiometer was selected so that the power input to each diode detector would be @xmath11  dbm during science observations .",
    "the resulting signal level is low enough to keep the diode detectors in the square law regime , but high enough so that intrinsic detector noise , and that added by the post detection electronics , degrade radiometer sensitivity by @xmath12 .    a total power radiometer s sensitivity can be described by the radiometer equation @xcite , @xmath13 which relates the radiometer noise , @xmath14 , for an integration period @xmath15 , to the input referenced system noise temperature , @xmath16 , and the effective rf bandwidth of the radiometers , @xmath17 , given by @xmath18 ^ 2}{\\int [ g(\\nu)^2]d\\nu } \\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the frequency dependent _ power _ response of the radiometer .",
    "the second term under the radical in equation  [ eqn : rad_sense ] is the fractional power gain variation of the radiometer on the time scale of the integration , and would vanish for an ideal radiometer system .",
    "the low noise and wide bandwidth of hemt amplifiers make them strong candidates for use in the measurement of continuum signals , such as the cmb radiation .",
    "unfortunately these amplifiers exhibit small fluctuations of their microwave gain with an approximate ` @xmath20 ' frequency spectrum @xcite which results in an appreciable gain variation term as described above .",
    "although these fluctuations are small , when combined with the extremely wide microwave bandwidth of the amplifiers , they limit the sensitivity achievable by simple total power radiometers for integration times longer than several milliseconds . the frequency at which the gain fluctuations contribute a variance to a total power radiometer s output equal to the intrinsic radiometric noise is parameterized as the @xmath20 knee frequency , @xmath21 . [ 1/fdef ] total power radiometers built with the _ map _ amplifiers with similar effective rf bandwidths would have @xmath21 values ranging from @xmath22  for k - band up to @xmath23  for w - band .",
    "it is well known that differential radiometers can largely circumvent this problem if the differential ` offset ' of the radiometer , @xmath24 , and the magnitude of signal being measured are both small compared to the radiometer s input - referenced system noise temperature .",
    "such is the case with the _ map _ radiometers , leading to their differential design . for a given rf bandwidth",
    "the knee frequency for a differential radiometer is related to the amplifier s knee frequency by @xmath25 for a @xmath26 gain fluctuation spectrum .",
    "measurements performed on a prototype w - band _ map _ amplifier @xcite in a system with comparable rf bandwidth give @xmath27  and @xmath28 .",
    "for @xmath29  k and @xmath30  k , typical values for _ map _ w - band radiometers , the predicted knee frequency of the differential radiometer is @xmath31  . by comparison _ map _",
    "s spin frequency is 0.0077  .",
    "a summary of the top level design parameters for radiometers in all five frequency bands is given in table  [ table : nom_bands ] .",
    "note that the noise levels shown in this table are @xmath32 higher than those calculated from equation  [ eqn : rad_sense ] owing to the differential design of the _ map _ radiometers .",
    "[ table : nom_bands ]      figure  [ fig : full_rad_dia ] is a diagram of the _ map _ radiometers .",
    "the focal plane assembly ( fpa ) consists of the feed horns , cold portions of the radiometers , and structure , all of which operate near 90  k in flight .",
    "the receiver box ( rxb ) , which comprises the warm radiometer components , phase switch driver circuit boards , and structure , is located near the center of the satellite and operates at a nominal temperature of @xmath33  k. microwave signals from the fpa are passed to the rxb by 40 thin - wall stainless steel waveguides that provide thermal isolation .",
    "the decision to split the radiometer into warm and cold sections in this manner was motivated by performance , scheduling and cost considerations .",
    "running as few components cold as possible increased reliability by reducing the number of components undergoing large ( 100  k @xmath34 300",
    "k ) thermal cycles , saved time by allowing most of the component characterization tests to be performed near room temperature , and eliminated the need for development of cryogenic detectors and preamplifier circuits .",
    "the use of warm hemt amplification stages has performance advantages since @xmath21 of hemt amplifiers operating warm is significantly lower than for amplifiers operating cryogenically .",
    "this configuration also allowed for an rf tight enclosure to be built around the rxb components , preventing the high level rf signals present in these components from coupling back to the low signal level fpa section , reducing the possibility of ring - type oscillations or other artifacts associated with such feedback .",
    "the interior of the rxb and fpa enclosures are lined with microwave absorbing fabric   to dampen cavity modes present in the enclosure .",
    "radiometers are identified by a three part designator .",
    "the first part consists of one or two letters ( k , ka , q , v or w ) that specify the nominal operating frequency band of the radiometer .",
    "the second part consists of a single digit @xmath35 that indicates which pair of focal plane feed horns are associated with the radiometer .",
    "the final part also consists of a single digit ( 1 or 2 ) and is used to denote which of the two linear polarizations of the designated feed horn pair the radiometer senses .",
    "designations of ` @xmath36 ' and ` @xmath37 ' indicate that the radiometers are connected to the main - arm and side - arm of the orthomode transducers ( omts ) respectively .",
    "see @xcite for details of the focal plane geometry and polarization orientations of each omt with respect to the satellite .",
    "a pair of radiometers associated with the two polarizations of a given feed is termed a differencing assembly ( da ) and is specified using only the first two elements of the designator , such as ka1 .",
    "a diagram of the _ map _ instrument electronics is given in figure  [ fig : full_inst_dia ] . the analog electronics unit ( aeu ) contains the the data collection circuitry for the radiometers , and the precision readout circuitry for the platinum resistance thermometers .",
    "these thermometers monitor the temperature of numerous radiometer components to assist in determining levels of possible systematic errors .",
    "the power distribution unit ( pdu ) contains the dc - dc converters that convert the 31.5  v nominal spacecraft bus voltage to that required by the phase switch drivers , line drivers , and the commandable power supplies which power the fpa and rxb hemt amplifiers .",
    "the digital electronics unit ( deu ) contains the digital multiplexers and control circuitry needed to accumulate the science and housekeeping data and pass it to the main computer processor over the spacecraft 1773 fiber optic data bus .",
    "the aeu , pdu and deu are mounted on the outside of the hex hub of the spacecraft structure , are continuously shielded from the sun by the solar array and are cooled by direct radiation to space .",
    "more detailed descriptions of relevant parts these systems are presented later and in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : simple_rad_dia ] contains a slightly simplified version of the radiometer diagram along with the relevant values of signals present in various sections of the radiometer .",
    "` a ' and ` b ' represent the instantaneous , time dependent voltages emitted by cryogenic input loads , load - a and load - b , respectively .",
    "these loads represent the thermal signal from one linear polarization of the microwave background radiation . in the satellite , these signals",
    "are obtained from the output of the omt attached to the back of the feed horns .",
    "for simplicity it is first assumed that most of the components in the radiometer are ideal , apart from the amplifiers which are described by instantaneous input referenced noise _ voltages _ , @xmath38 , and instantaneous _",
    "gains , @xmath39 , where the index @xmath40 specifies in which phase - matched leg the components resides .",
    "the time dependent gain of the hemt amplifiers has been shown explicitly to emphasize that it is not constant , as is usually assumed .",
    "it is assumed that all the components between the cold hybrid tees and warm hybrid tees are perfectly phase - matched , so only terms involving intentional differential phase shifts between the legs are presented .",
    "the effects of the various non - idealities are discussed in subsequent sections .    since the signals ` a ' and ` b ' are thermally induced noise voltages from two separate loads they are uncorrelated , and hence obey the relations @xmath41 where",
    "@xmath42 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath43 is the bandwidth over which the voltages a and b are measured and @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the physical temperature of the loads in kelvin .",
    "the over - bar indicates a time average with a period long compared to the period of the microwave signal , but short compared to the time scale of instabilities in any of the microwave components .",
    "given these assumptions , the voltages present at the inputs of the two hemt amplifiers are @xmath46 where the difference in sign of the b signal reflects the @xmath47 relative phase shift between the signals in the phase - matched leg introduced by the cold hybrid tee .",
    "the signals after amplification by the hemt amplifiers become @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the input referenced noise voltages added by the cryogenic hemt amplifiers .",
    "the phase switches are used to introduce additional 0 or 180@xmath51 phase shifts between the phase - matched legs . to accomplish this one of them",
    "is left ` jammed ' in one state ( here chosen as leg 1 ) to provide the correct insertion phase while the other ( leg 2 ) is switched between two states .",
    "the signals at the output of the warm hybrid tee are then @xmath52 and @xmath53 where the upper sign refers to the signal with the phase switch in the @xmath54 relative phase state and the lower sign to the switch in the @xmath47 state .",
    "the detectors are operated in the square law region where their output voltage is proportional to the square of their input voltage .",
    "the response of these are represented as @xmath55 for the left and right detectors where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the responsivities of the two detectors . in general",
    "these responsivities are a function of the input microwave frequency , but for now will be assumed frequency independent and equal so that @xmath58 .",
    "the outputs of the two detectors then become @xmath59 and @xmath60 where equations [ eq : input_prop1 ] and [ eq : input_prop2 ] have been used together with the fact that the intrinsic voltage noise of the hemt amplifiers is uncorrelated to the signals from either of the loads , i.e. @xmath61 the outputs consist of three terms .",
    "the first two terms arise from the sum of the mean power of the radiometer inputs signals , @xmath62 , and the noise power added by the cryogenic hemt amplifiers , @xmath63 .",
    "the contribution arising from the radiometer input signal is proportional to the antenna temperature of the input signals , while the term from the hemt amplifier s noise is proportional to the hemt amplifier s input - referenced noise temperature .",
    "these amplifier noise temperatures range from 30  k @xmath34 96  k for k - band through w - band respectively .",
    "both these terms are multiplied by the time dependent gain terms @xmath64 , and as such fluctuate due to small gain variations of the amplifiers .",
    "because of the large system bandwidth , even small gain variations can substantially impact the performance of the radiometers .",
    "for example , at w - band the nominal effective radiometric bandwidth is @xmath65  , so the fractional change in gain that produces a signal equal to the intrinsic radiometric noise after integrating for one second is , @xmath66    the signal of interest is the third term , which is the difference between the antenna temperatures of the two radiometer inputs , and is multiplied by the product of the voltage gains of the two amplifiers .",
    "the magnitude of the prefactor @xmath67 is much smaller that that of the first two terms , typically in the mk regime .",
    "there are two techniques for recovering this signal in the presence of the signals from the first two terms , which dominate the detector outputs .",
    "the first is to notice that the first two terms appear identically on the output of both detectors whereas the signal of interest appears with the opposite sign on the two detectors .",
    "if the output of the detectors are differenced , the offending terms cancel and the desired terms add .",
    "this assumes that the responsivities of the two detectors are identical .",
    "the other method is to difference the output of each detector with the phase switch in opposite states . in this case",
    "the first two terms remain constant and hence cancel , while the third term changes sign when the phase switch flips , and therefore produces a net output . for this method to work the time scale at which the phase switch is switched and the differencing occurs",
    "must be short compared to the time scale of the instabilities in the radiometer components , otherwise the value of the first two terms will change in the interim and therefore will not cancel .    the _ map _ radiometers utilize both techniques .",
    "the phase switches are toggled at 2.5  and on board lock - in amplifiers perform the synchronous differencing of each detector s output .",
    "the output of the lock - in associated with each detector s output is then averaged and telemetered to the ground where the differencing between pairs of detectors is performed .",
    "this combination provides optimal rejection of various instabilities .",
    "for example , if only the detector - detector differencing were performed low frequency drifts in the detector responsivity and offset voltage drifts of the following video amplifiers would limit the performance of the radiometer . on the other hand",
    "if only the temporal differencing were performed the switching frequency of the phase switches would have had to be substantially increased due to the proximity of the @xmath20 knee of the w - band amplifiers .",
    "this would have increased the ` dead time ' of the detectors due to the blanking interval and hence reduced the sensitivity of the radiometers .",
    "( see section  [ sec : aeu ] . )",
    "figure  [ fig : w11_011psd ] presents a noise power spectral density measurement of the w11 radiometer made during the radiometer assembly and testing program .",
    "demodulated data for each detector , l and r , and the normalized mean , @xmath68 and difference @xmath69 of the detector signals are displayed . the noise power spectral densities are flat to very low frequencies as expected , despite the fact that the amplifiers @xmath70 frequency for the rf bandwidth of this radiometer is @xmath23  khz . in the absence of gain fluctuations , the difference signal between the detectors should have a noise power level lower by a factor of @xmath32 than each detector s individual noise .",
    "note that the noise power spectral density of the difference signals is lower that the individual detector noises by _ more _ than this factor .",
    "this occurs because there is still a substantial degree of amplifier gain fluctuations present at the 2.5  phase switch drive frequency .",
    "this contributes additional correlated noise to both detectors , in addition to the intrinsic radiometer noise .",
    "when the detector signals are differenced this additional correlated term cancels , as described above , resulting in a noise power reduction of greater than @xmath32 relative to the individual detector noises .",
    "non - idealities in the components comprising the radiometers lead to effects not described by the previous analysis .",
    "a detailed model simultaneously incorporating all such effects would prove complicated and not readily understandable .",
    "instead , the largest and most important effects are described individually so as to provide an understanding of how each term relates to the overall radiometer performance . in doing so",
    ", it is important to realize that the radiometers ` signal ' and ` noise ' are often altered differently by these effects .",
    "since the switching is accomplished through phase modulation , it is important to understand how phase and amplitude mismatches between the two phase - matched legs affect radiometer performance .",
    "there are two types of phase error that can occur .",
    "nominally there should be a @xmath47 difference in the insertion phase of the phase switch between its two states .",
    "fortunately the phase switches are excellent in this respect , with departures from ideality of @xmath71 .",
    "such small errors do not significantly affect the radiometers performance .",
    "the more important phase error is the departure from the @xmath54 ( or @xmath47 ) phase match between the two legs of the radiometer .",
    "these errors are typically much larger since each leg comprises several components , each of which can contribute to the mismatch .",
    "first consider effects on the signal terms .",
    "equation  [ eq : warm_hybrid_output_left ] describes the input voltage to one of the square law detectors .",
    "ideally @xmath72 , so signals originating from source a travel through both legs of the radiometer and appear at the input of the square law detector with equal amplitude and the same ( or opposite ) phase so that that they add ( or cancel ) .",
    "the signal at the output of the square law detector from source a therefore is either @xmath73 or @xmath74 , depending on the phase switch state . in the presence of phase and amplitude",
    "mismatches the voltage signals at the input of the detectors for the two phase switch states become @xmath75 and @xmath76 . after square law detection and demodulation",
    "the resulting signal is @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the phase error as shown in figure  [ fig : phase_err ] .",
    "signals from the ` b ' source are affected similarly , so the net effect is that the amplitudes of the modulated signals output from each detector , @xmath79 , are @xmath80    the noise is affected quite differently . the _ noise _ in the two phase - matched legs of the radiometer is uncorrelated since it originates from different amplifiers .",
    "the noise voltages present at the input of the left and right detectors are @xmath81 and @xmath82 , where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are defined by equations  [ eqn : u_def1 ] and  [ eqn : u_def2 ] .",
    "the corresponding instantaneous input powers to the detectors are @xmath85 and @xmath86 , while average power on both detectors is the same and is given by @xmath87 .",
    "the detectors operate in the square law region , so the instantaneous and mean detector voltages are @xmath88 the variances of the detector output voltages , @xmath89  measures of the radiometer noise  are proportional to the square of the total power incident on each detector and are given by @xmath90 the variance of the _ difference _ between the detector voltages , @xmath91 , is @xmath92 where the relation @xmath93 has been used to relate the covariance of the detector output voltages to the power incident to the two inputs of the warm hybrid tee as shown in appendix  [ app : noise_cov ] .",
    "it has also been assumed that the responsivity of the two detectors are identical , @xmath94 .",
    "this is achieved in practice by separately telemetering the signals from the two detectors to the ground and individually calibrating them before calculating the difference .",
    "it is a good approximation to assume that the input referenced noise temperature of the two amplification chains within a radiometer are equal , @xmath95 .",
    "the signal to noise ratio , @xmath96 , for _ each _ detector then depends on the phase and gain mismatch between the phase - matched legs , ( equations [ eq : det_signal_l ] , [ eq : det_signal_r ] , [ eq : det_noise_l ] , [ eq : det_noise_r ] ) @xmath97 however , the signal to noise ratio for the _ difference _ of the detector outputs is _ independent _ of the gain mismatch , ( equations  [ eq : det_signal_l ] , [ eq : det_signal_r ] , [ eq : det_noise_diff ] ) @xmath98 this behavior is similar to that of a true correlation radiometer , and results from the existence of the detector noise covariance as described in appendix  [ app : noise_cov ] .    the covariance between the output of the two detectors ( equation  [ eqn : det_cov ] ) of each radiometer was used as a diagnostic to verify the health of the radiometers during integration and testing .",
    "any change from the nominal value measured during radiometer assembly would indicate a change in the relative rf gain of the amplification chains .",
    "similar data are available during flight , since the two detector outputs are separately telemetered to the ground and provides a continuous monitor of the gain balance between the two phase - matched legs of each radiometer .    the _ map _ design specification was to hold the gain imbalance between chains to @xmath99  db and the phase difference to @xmath100 , making the loss in sensitivity from the phase error @xmath101 6% .",
    "it should be noted that although the above relation describes the independence of the signal to noise ratio from amplifier gain imbalances , any other sources of gain mismatch , due to imbalances in the hybrid tees or losses in the waveguides or phase switches affect the signal to noise ratio in the exact same way , so the gains in the previous equations can be thought of as the gain of the entire system between the hybrid tees .",
    "imperfect isolation between the two ports of the cold hybrid tee connected to the cryogenic hemt amplifiers is a potential source of a radiometric offset .",
    "consider the noise voltage , @xmath49 , emitted from the input of one of the cryogenic hemt amplifiers .",
    "the magnitude of this voltage will roughly correspond to the input referenced noise temperature of the hemt amplifier .",
    "this noise will have some correlation with the output voltage of the hemt amplifier @xcite .",
    "let the correlation coefficient between these voltages be @xmath102 .",
    "although the value of this coefficient is not well known , it is expected to fall in the range of 0.1 to 0.3 .",
    "if the _ power _ isolation between the e and h ports of the hybrid tee is @xmath103 , the resulting voltage at the input of the other cryogenic hemt amplifier produced by the noise voltage output from the first will be @xmath104 where typical values of @xmath105 are @xmath106 since this signal is coherent between the two phase - matched legs of the radiometer , it can produce an additional contribution to the total detector power that is modulated by the phase switch .",
    "the size of this effect will be roughly @xmath107 where @xmath108 is an additional factor that allows for the effect of bandwidth averaging .",
    "its magnitude is roughly @xmath109 for @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the coherence length of the microwave signal , determined by the bandwidth of the radiometer , @xmath17 , and @xmath112 is the path length difference between the two paths the signals travel before being recombined in the warm hybrid tee .",
    "since noise emitted from both amplifiers contributes to this effect , its magnitude is proportional to the sum of the noise temperatures . the desire to minimize the size of this effect led to the configuration in which the amplifiers are attached to the e and h arms of the hybrid tees , since the e - h arm isolation is typically 10  db better than the colinear - colinear arm isolation .",
    "there is an additional term that can also contribute to this effect caused by reflections from either the omt or the corrugated feed . in this case",
    "the power emitted from the input of the hemt amplifier enters the cold hybrid tee through an e or h - port and is coupled to the colinear ports .",
    "this signal is then reflected from the omt or feed horn , re - enters the cold hybrid through the colinear ports and is coupled to the opposite h or e - port .",
    "this effectively reduces the e - port to h - port isolation of the cold hybrid tee . the contribution from this effect to a radiometer s offset",
    "is @xmath113  k.      slight differences between the frequency dependence of the toggled phase switch s transmission coefficients in its two states can lead to an effective radiometer offset .",
    "this occurs if the frequency responses of the two detector / filter combinations on a radiometer differ .",
    "the detector output voltage for detector @xmath114 with the phase switch in state @xmath115 can be expressed as @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the rf noise power spectral density entering the toggled phase switch , @xmath118 is the frequency dependent power transmission coefficient of the phase switch in the two states , @xmath40 , and @xmath119 is the frequency dependent responsivity of the detector filter combination , @xmath120 .",
    "the integral extends over the rf bandwidth of the radiometer , and @xmath121 is a constant detector output voltage arising from the noise power from the unswitched leg of the radiometer .",
    "consider the situation where all other sources of radiometric offset vanish .",
    "the condition to null the _ modulated _ component of the right detector output voltage is @xmath122 , however this does not ensure that the modulated component of the left detector s output voltage will vanish , @xmath123 , unless @xmath124 .",
    "in fact , it raises the question as to the definition of the offset for this type of radiometer . the definition used by _",
    "map _ is that a radiometer s offset is the temperature difference between thermal loads connected to the radiometer s inputs that produces the condition @xmath125 .",
    "once this condition is achieved by setting the temperature of the test input loads , the difference between the average losses of the two states of toggled phase switch is adjusted to make both @xmath126 by adjusting the phase switch bias currents .",
    "this definition of offset has the advantage that it is independent of the sign and gain of the data collection system used to record the detector output voltages .",
    "standing waves between the cold and warm hemt amplifiers degrade the phase match and gain flatness of the radiometers , with the associated reductions in sensitivity previously described .",
    "traditionally , isolators are used to eliminate standing waves , however the only viable isolator for _ map _ radiometers , given the large fractional bandwidths , would be faraday rotation isolators .",
    "such isolators unfortunately exhibit small changes in characteristics under the influence of externally applied magnetic fields .",
    "the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) used isolators @xcite , as well as ferrite switches , and needed to correct the data for variations resulting from the changing orientation of earth s magnetic fields with respect to the spacecraft , even though efforts were made to magnetically shield the ferrite devices . despite the fact that _ map _ operates far from earth , and therefore in a much smaller magnetic field , @xmath127  nt , there were still concerns related to magnetic fields generated on board the spacecraft from the reaction wheels and other high current spacecraft systems .",

    "the warm ( rxb ) radiometer components were attached to a second large aluminum plate , the ` warm stage ' , that was temperature controlled using peltier heat pumps .",
    "the ` warm stage ' temperature could be adjusted from @xmath182  c to + 50  c , and was used to vary the temperature of the warm components .",
    "test equipment available included vector network analyzers ( vnas ) , swept frequency sources and rf spectral analysis from 10  mhz to 170  , low frequency spectrum analyzers , and a set of large helmholtz coils and power supplies , used to apply magnetic fields to the radiometers for measuring magnetic susceptibilities .",
    "each test chamber had a full set of power supplies , used to power the radiometers , and a data collection system used to log and analyze the radiometer s outputs .",
    "the design of these systems closely matched the design of the flight systems , minimizing the risk of incompatibilities when the radiometers were connected to the flight electronics later in the program .",
    "lakeshore model 330 cryogenic temperature regulators were used to regulate the temperature of the cryogenic loads connected to the radiometers inputs and the operating temperature of the fpa components on the ` cold stage ' .",
    "components were visually inspected and characterized for key performance parameters , shown in table  [ table : comp_char ] .",
    "these data were used both to ensure that the components met performance specifications and as a basis for component selection .    [ table : comp_char ]    using their measured characteristics , components were then selected to form the two phase - matched legs of the radiometers .",
    "the input hybrid tees were selected for best e - port to h - port isolation , power balance and loss balance , averaged across the radiometer s frequency band .",
    "the warm hybrid tees were selected based largely on power balance .",
    "phase switches to be toggled were selected for @xmath183 match between the two states , while those used in the jammed leg were selected based upon the match of their insertion phase to a corresponding toggled phase switch .",
    "the complex gain of each phase - matched leg of the radiometer was then calculated based on the measured component characteristics and various substitutions made to optimize the phase and amplitude matches .",
    "the phase - matched section of the radiometer ( all the components between the cold and warm hybrid tees inclusive ) was then assembled in the test chamber with the selected components .",
    "the vna was connected to the partially assembled radiometer as shown in figure  [ fig : phase_meas ] .",
    "the signal from the source port of the vna was fed into one of the input ports of the cold hybrid tee after passing through two 30  db couplers .",
    "these couplers were used to reduce the drive signal strength from the vna so as not to saturate the warm hemt amplifiers . to reduce the thermal noise level entering the radiometer during cryogenic tests , the 30  db coupler closest to the cold hybrid tee was located inside the test chamber , and operated at the same physical temperature as the other fpa components .",
    "the main - arm of this coupler , and the unused input port of the cold hybrid tee were terminated with waveguide terminations that could be operated at cryogenic temperature .",
    "one of the output ports of the warm hybrid tee was attach to the receiving port of the vna through waveguide feedthroughs .",
    "the unused port of the warm hybrid tee was terminated with a room temperature load . by alternately powering the amplifiers in the two legs of the radiometers it was possible to make accurate relative measurements of the complex gain of the two phase - matched legs .",
    "the phase and loss of the fixturing components drops out when the ratio of the complex gains is taken , provided it remains constant over the several minute interval between measurements .    after verifying that the room temperature complex gain agreed with",
    "that modeled , the test chamber was pumped , leak tested and cooled , and cold gain measurements performed . at this point small changes in amplifier bias were tried , to see if the overall phase and amplitude match could be improved , while allowing for a waveguide shim of up to @xmath184 in thickness to be inserted in either leg .",
    "once an optimum bias and shim thickness was determined , the radiometer was warmed and the waveguide shim manufactured and installed . the room temperature complex gain",
    "was then remeasured and the chamber cooled .",
    "the cold complex gain was then measured under nominal operating conditions as well as with variations in bias and temperatures of the fpa and rxb components over the expected operating ranges .",
    "checks were made for parasitic oscillations by connecting a spectrum analyzer to the port where the vna receiver had been attached ( see figure  [ fig : phase_meas ] . ) measurements were then made with the source module of the vna replaced by a load to ensure no in - band parasitic oscillations were present .",
    "additional measurements where made with a continuous wave in - band source connected the the radiometer s inputs , to search for inter - modulation products resulting from an out - of - band oscillation that would not be directly observable due to the low frequency cutoff characteristics of the waveguide .    upon completion of the preceding rf characterization ,",
    "the radiometer was warmed , and a matched set of filters and detectors attached to the two output ports of the warm hybrid tee , along with two temporary line drivers connected to the data collection system .",
    "temperature regulated loads were attached to the two input ports of the hybrid tee , and the radiometer operated at room temperature as an initial check .",
    "the radiometer was then cooled to nominal operating temperature and the temperatures of the two temperature regulated input loads set to the same value , typically @xmath22  k. the levels of the phase switch bias currents",
    "were then adjusted to minimize the average amplitude of the square wave signal on the two detectors synchronous with the toggling of the phase switch , which effectively matched the band - average insertion loss of the toggled phase switch in its two states .",
    "the insertion phase of the phase switches is essentially independent of the drive current over the ranges used , so there was no need to re - characterize the radiometers phase match .",
    "the dc component of the detector voltage was then measured and detector load resistors selected so that the in flight detector dc bias voltage    would be about 10  mv .",
    "the load resistors are connected directly across the detector and have values ranging from none ( open circuit ) to @xmath185 , with typical values of .",
    "after several preliminary measurements of the radiometer s offset , gain and sensitivity , the radiometer was warmed , and the permanent resistors installed on the line driver circuit boards and phase switch driver circuit boards .",
    "numerous test were performed to verify proper operation of the radiometers , supply a baseline for comparison with later tests , and to measure some characteristics necessary for analysis of the flight data .",
    "a set of basic radiometric tests were performed both with the radiometers at ambient temperature and at nominal operating temperature :    gain measurements - the change in the demodulated radiometric output caused by changes in temperatures of test loads applied to the radiometers inputs .",
    "each detector was calibrated versus each input .",
    "offsets - the temperature difference between the load temperatures required to bring the demodulated outputs from the two detectors comprising a radiometer to the same level .    noise - the radiometric noise spectral density for each detector individually , and for the two detectors of each radiometer combined .",
    "@xmath70 - the frequency at which the radiometer noise spectral density increases by a factor of @xmath32 above its high frequency limiting value .",
    "i - v curves - the i - v ( current vs. voltage ) characteristics of all the amplifiers were measured for each amplifier bias input , while the other inputs for that amplifier remained at their nominal values .",
    "the value of the rf bias voltage on each detector was also recorded during these tests .",
    "these data proved quite valuable for several applications .",
    "first it provides a method for verifying the health of the hemt devices comprising the amplifiers .",
    "these devices are extremely sensitive to over - voltages , such as produced by static discharges or turn - on transients of power supplies .",
    "such damage almost always causes a measurable change in the dc i - v characteristics of the device .",
    "these measurements therefore provide a good baseline with which to compare later measurements to verify the health of the hemt devices .",
    "the detailed shape of the i - v characteristics of each amplifier is quite unique .",
    "this information was used during integration and testing to verify that the entire end - to - end amplifier biasing system comprising software , bias supplies and harnessing was correctly configured for all 200 drain and gate voltage supplies .    the detector rf bias values give a direct measurement of changes in the microwave gain of the radiometer under different amplifier bias conditions .",
    "such data has many uses , such as verifying that the amplifiers gain versus bias voltage coefficients are consistent with the values assumed in the systematic error budget .",
    "finally , small discontinuities in the i - v characteristics ( or their first derivative ) often accompany the onset of parasitic oscillations in microwave devices .",
    "indeed , several such discontinuities associated with the onset of oscillations were detected by these measurements , although not at the nominal in - flight operating biases .",
    "table  [ table : final_perf ] presents a comparison of the radiometer sensitivity , offset and @xmath70 frequency ( defined in section [ 1/fdef ] ) as measured during assembly and test , and during the second instrument level cold test at gsfc .",
    "the sensitivity values presented are the best estimates of those expected in flight , and therefore have been scaled to allow for the slight differences between the radiometer operating environment during testing and those expected in flight .",
    "the princeton measurements were made with reference loads attached directly to the input of the radiometers omts , while the gsfc measurements were performed with reference loads attached to the apertures of the feed horns .",
    "the differences in @xmath24 are believed to arise from the additional differential loss in the feed horns and small reflections from the feed horn reference loads .",
    "the @xmath70 values in both cases are considered upper limits , since the actual stability of the reference load temperatures is expected to be contribute to the observed value .",
    "[ table : final_perf ]      a number of additional tests were performed only with the radiometers near their nominal in - flight operating temperature .      one possible source of systematic error results from changes in a radiometers performance caused by small , periodic temperature variations .",
    "much effort was expended to limit both the size of such temperature variations and to minimize the associated change in the radiometers characteristics .",
    "susceptibility coefficients were measured by monitoring the radiometers outputs as the temperatures of the warm and cold sections were varied over a 10 - 20  k range , in order to produce measurable effects .",
    "susceptibility coefficients are required to relate the change in radiometer performance to the change in the physical temperature of the radiometer components .",
    "measurements were made of the variations of offset and gain versus the temperature of both the fpa and rxb sections .",
    "offset versus temperature measurements were made by setting the temperature of the two input loads to null the radiometers outputs .",
    "the temperature of each radiometer section ( fpa or rxb ) was then varied , and the resulting changes in the radiometers outputs recorded . since the radiometers outputs were",
    "initially nulled gain changes have little effect on the radiometers outputs , so the offset dependence is easily determined .",
    "gain variations were measured by setting a @xmath186  k temperature difference between the input loads , varying the temperature of the radiometers sections and recording the radiometers output .",
    "these data have effects both from the temperature dependence of the offset and the varying gain , however , since the offset dependence was measured separately it is easily removed , allowing for determinations of the gain vs. temperature coefficient .",
    "these coefficients , combined with the predicted temperature variations , were used to verify that the expected in - flight radiometer stability met specification . in flight , the actual temperature variations of 55 key components are measured with 0.5  mk resolution , allowing for a direct measure of the thermal stability of the radiometers , verifying both the thermal design and , with use of the aforementioned susceptibility coefficients , the size of expected temperature induced radiometric artifacts .",
    "no corrections to the radiometers outputs are expected to be necessary due to temperature variation induced effects in the radiometers .",
    "after the instrument was mated to the observatory tests were performed to search for interactions between the instrument and spacecraft systems .",
    "the final observatory level thermal vacuum test was conducted with the instrument operating near temperatures expected in flight and with the cryogenic temperature regulated loads attached to the feed horn apertures .",
    "the outputs of the radiometers were recorded as the spacecraft systems were exercised .",
    "tests included searches for radiometric artifacts induced by the reaction wheels , transponder , bus voltage fluctuations and radio frequency noise coupled to the instrument through the power bus .",
    "no unexpected effects were observed during these tests and no corrections to the flight radiometric data arising from interactions with the spacecraft systems are anticipated .",
    "measurements of the radiometers bandpasses are necessary for the analysis of in - flight data . unlike the radiometric gains and offset , which are calibrated in flight , bandpass measurements must be made before launch .",
    "measurements were made by injecting a small signal into the one port of the cold hybrid tee and recording the radiometric response .",
    "the level of the signal was set to yield a readily measurable radiometric response , but not so large as to cause non - linear effects .",
    "figure  [ fig : bandpass_meas ] shows the test configuration used for these measurements .",
    "the vna was used to make precise measurements of the frequency dependent transmission characteristics of all the components between the leveled source and radiometer s input at the cold hybrid tee .",
    "the swept signal source was calibrated to produce a frequency independent power level at the output of the through port of the room temperature 30  db coupler .",
    "the bandpass was measured by stepping the synthesized source through 201 frequencies , @xmath187 , and recording the output of the radiometer at each frequency with the rf output of the synthesizer enabled and disabled .",
    "differences between the data taken with the synthesizer on and off then yielded the radiometer s response to the applied signal .",
    "corrections were applied to these data to account for the frequency dependence of couplers and waveguide .",
    "measurements were made at different power levels to ensure that non - linear effects arising from the large signal levels were not present .",
    "the procedure resulted in a bandpass measurement relating the response from each detector to the input microwave _ power _ , referenced to the input port of the cold hybrid tee , so it does not include possible frequency dependences of the feed horn , omt and waveguides connecting the omt to the cold hybrid tees .",
    "the transmission coefficients of the omt and waveguide sections were measured with the vna and small ( @xmath188  db ) corrections applied to the measured responses , resulting in corrected responses , @xmath189 and @xmath190 , for each detector .",
    "absolute calibration of the radiometers is performed in flight using observations of the cmb dipole .",
    "the demodulated digitized output of each detector , @xmath191 , can be expressed as @xmath192 where @xmath193 designates the detector of the radiometer , @xmath194 is the radiometric offset , @xmath195 , is the overall gain of the radiometer and data collection system , and @xmath196 , is the power per unit bandwidth at frequency @xmath187 of the differential signal coupled to the radiometer s input .",
    "calibration is performed by comparing the _ change _ in each detector s output signal , @xmath197 , to the corresponding change in the input differential power signal arising from the cmb dipole : @xmath198 here @xmath199 is the power per unit bandwidth delivered to a single mode by a blackbody at temperature @xmath200  k , @xmath201 is planck s constant , and @xmath202 is the change in the differential thermodynamic temperature of the observed cmb dipole calculated from the orientation of the satellite .",
    "the calibration constants , @xmath203 , are defined so that digitized data from each detector may be converted into measured thermodynamic temperature differences , @xmath204 , by @xmath205 the calibration constants are measured using the relation @xmath206 where the brackets indicate an average over many observations .",
    "the calibrated data of the two detectors are combined with a simple average to yield the calibrated radiometer output , @xmath207 the frequency response of this combined signal is an average of the two detector frequency responses @xmath208 combined responses of representative radiometers in each of map s frequency bands are presented in figure  [ fig : bandpasses ] .",
    "the response of a radiometer to a signal with an arbitrary spectrum is obtained by integrating the product of @xmath209 and the power spectrum over the passband of the radiometer .",
    "the factors used to convert thermodynamic temperature differences to rayleigh - jeans temperature differences for the calibrated radiometer output were calculated using the relation @xmath210 and are listed in table  [ table : bandpass_coeff ] . the numerator on the right hand side of equation  [ eqn : tth_to_trj ]",
    "is uniformly weighted with frequency since the power per unit bandwidth in rayleigh - jeans units is independent of frequency .",
    "the thermal center frequency for each radiometer , @xmath211 , is the frequency at which the rayleigh - jeans to thermodynamic conversion equals that calculated for the radiometer , @xmath212 and are also given in table  [ table : bandpass_coeff ] .",
    "the factors need to convert an observed rayleigh - jeans temperature difference to a rayleigh - jeans temperature difference at another frequency , @xmath213 , for objects with antenna temperature scaling as @xmath214 were calculated from the relation @xmath215 in these units a source with a constant rayleigh - jeans temperature has @xmath216 the resulting coefficients were fit to a function of the form @xmath217 for @xmath218 and the resultant parameters , @xmath219 , @xmath220 and @xmath221 are given in table  [ table : bandpass_coeff ] .",
    "these quantities apply to diffuse sources that completely fill the beams of the instrument . for resolved sources additional terms resulting from the frequency dependent beam sizes",
