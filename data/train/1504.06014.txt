    "since its proposal by bose @xcite , and generalization by einstein @xcite , the quantum statistics of integer spin particles ( bosons ) did represent a fundamental field of study in both theoretical and experimental physics .",
    "one of the most important property of bosonic systems is their phase transition to a condensed state , in which all particles are in the same quantum ground state .",
    "this quantum bosonic system is called a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , and from a physical point of view it is characterized by a sharp peak over a broader distribution in both coordinate and momentum space .",
    "the quantum explanation for this behavior is that in a bec particles become correlated with each other , and their wavelengths overlap .",
    "note that the correlation means that the thermal wavelength @xmath0 is greater than the mean inter - particle distance @xmath1 .",
    "it occurs at a critical temperature @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the mass of an individual condensate particle , @xmath4 is the number density , and @xmath5 is boltzmann s constant @xcite .",
    "a coherent quantum state in the bosonic system develops either when the particle density @xmath6 is high enough , or when the temperature @xmath7 is sufficiently low . from the experimental point of view",
    ", the bose - einstein condensation can be detected by the observation of a sharp peak in the velocity distribution , which always appears when the system is below the critical temperature , @xmath8 .    in the laboratory",
    "the bose - einstein condensation was observed first in 1995 in dilute alkali gases , such as vapors of rubidium and sodium . to obtain the condensation",
    "the gases were confined in a magnetic trap , and cooled down to very low temperatures @xcite .",
    "the experiment producing a laboratory bec did represent a major achievement in experimental condensed matter physics , and the confirmation of the old and important predictions in theoretical statistical physics of bose and einstein .",
    "@xcite . note that in recent years quantum degenerate gases have been created by a multitude of experimental methods , including combination of laser and evaporative cooling techniques .",
    "thus the observation of the bose - einstein condensation did open several new lines of multidisciplinary research at the border of atomic , statistical and condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "the bose - einstein condensation processes are assumed to play an important role in the understanding of many fundamental processes in condensed matter physics .",
    "for example , superfluidity of low temperature liquids , like @xmath9he , can be explained by assuming a bose - einstein condensation process @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that experimental observations as well as quantum theoretical calculations estimate the condensate fraction @xmath10 at @xmath11 for superfluid helium to be only around @xmath12 , a very small amount .",
    "hence , since a strongly correlated pair of fermions behaves approximately like a boson , the arising liquid helium superfluidity can be interpreted as resulting from the bose - einstein condensation of coupled fermions .",
    "a very similar physical model can be used to describe the transition to a superconducting state in a solid material ( metal ) .",
    "superconductivity can thus be interpreted as the condensation of electrons ( or holes ) into cooper pairs .",
    "the formation of the cooper pairs drastically reduces the resistance caused by the motion of electrons in metals , and thus leads to the formation of a superconductor @xcite .",
    "since bose - einstein condensation is a phenomenon that has been observed and thoroughly studied in terrestrial laboratories , the possibility that it may also occur in bosonic systems existing on astrophysical or cosmological scales can not be rejected _ a priori_.",
    "thus , it was proposed that dark matter , which is required to explain the dynamics of the neutral hydrogen clouds at large distances from the centers of the galaxies , and which is assumed to be a cold bosonic gravitationally bounded system , could also exist in the form of a bose - einstein condensate sin .",
    "a systematic study of the properties of bose - einstein condensed galactic dark matter halos was initiated in boha07 , and the astrophysical and cosmological implications of the existence of bose - einstein condensed dark matter have been investigated in detail recently @xcite .    from a theoretical point of view",
    "it was shown in @xcite that by introducing the madelung representation of the wave function , the dynamics of the bose einstein condensate dark matter halo is described by the continuity equation , and the hydrodynamic euler equations of the standard classical fluid mechanics .",
    "hence , bose - einstein condensed dark matter can be described theoretically as a gas , with the pressure and density related by a barotropic equation of state . in the case of self - interacting condensate dark matter with quartic self - interaction potential ,",
    "the equation of state is polytropic with index @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "bose - einstein condensation could play an important role in nuclear and quark matter physics , in the framework of the so - called bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) to bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) crossover . from a theoretical point of view",
    "it is expected that at ultra - high densities nuclear matter exists in the form of a degenerate fermi gas of quarks .",
    "the cooper pairs of quarks form near the fermi surface a bose - einstein condensate .",
    "hence high density nuclear matter represents , from a physical point of view , a so called color superconductor @xcite .",
    "when the attractive interaction between fermions is strong enough , and the temperature drops below the critical temperature , the fermions condense into the bosonic zero mode , and form a quark bec @xcite . as a first step towards the formation of the bec the fermions must form a bcs state , which can be realized when the attractive interaction between particles is weak .",
    "this system exhibits superfluid properties , which are characterized by the existence of an energy gap for single particle excitations .",
    "the energy gap is created by the formation of the cooper pairs . on the other hand a bec",
    "is formed when the attractive interaction between fermions is extremely strong .",
    "this interaction first leads to the formation of bound particles ( bosons ) , which at some critical temperature @xmath14 start to condense into the bosonic zero mode .",
    "it is important to mention that the bcs and bec states are smoothly connected ( crossover ) , without a phase transition between the two phases @xcite . for a recent review of the bcs - bec crossover see @xcite .",
    "the possibility of the existence of some forms of bose - einstein condensates in neutron stars has been considered a long time ago ( see glendenning @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "one possibility for the formation of a bec in a dense neutron star is the condensation of the negatively charged mesons , leading to the replacement of electrons with very high fermi momenta by mesons @xcite .",
    "bose - einstein condensation of kaons and anti - kaons in compact objects was also investigated in detail @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the presence of pion or kaon condensates may have at least two important effects on the global properties of dense neutron stars .",
    "firstly , bose - einstein condensation softens the equation of state ( eos ) of the stellar matter above the critical density for the onset of condensation .",
    "an important consequence of the softening of the eos is the reduction of the maximum neutron star mass . on the other hand , due to the softening of the eos ,",
    "the central density increases significantly .",
    "secondly , the condensation of mesons would lead to considerably enhanced neutrino luminosities , much higher than those of normal neutron matter .",
    "the increase in neutrino luminosity has important consequences on the neutron star cooling @xcite .",
    "another particle , which may be present inside neutron stars , and which may form a bose - einstein condensate , is the h - dibaryon .",
    "the h - dibaryon is a doubly strange six - quark composite .",
    "it has zero spin and isospin , and a baryon number @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "neutron star matter may also contain an important fraction of @xmath16 hyperons , neutral subatomic hadrons .",
    "they consist of one up , one down and one strange quark , and they are labelled @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16 hyperons may also combine to form h - dibaryons @xcite .",
    "thus , h - matter bose - einstein condensates may also exist at the center of very dense neutron stars , where the matter density is extremely high @xcite .",
    "an interesting possibility , is that neutrino superfluidity , as suggested by kapusta @xcite , may also lead to bose - einstein condensation inside neutron stars @xcite .",
    "thus theoretical results in nuclear matter physics indicate that the possibility of the existence of some forms of bose - einstein condensed matter inside compact astrophysical objects , like neutron or quark stars , or even the existence of stars formed entirely from a pure bec , can not be excluded _ a priori_. the properties of pure bec stars have been considered in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that stars formed of bose - einstein condensates with particle masses of the order of two neutron masses ( cooper pair ) and scattering length of the order of 10 - 20 fm have maximum masses of the order of @xmath18 , maximum central densities of the order of @xmath19 g/@xmath20 and minimum radii in the range of 10 - 20 km .",
    "hence bose - einstein condensed stars can form a large class of stable astrophysical objects , whose basic astrophysical parameters ( mass and radius ) sensitively depend on the mass of the condensed particle , and on the scattering length .",
    "it was also suggested that the recently observed neutron stars with masses in the range of @xmath21 ( vela x-1 , 4u 1700 - 377 , and the black widow pulsar b1957 + 20 ) are bose - einstein condensate stars .",
    "further properties of bec stars have been considered in @xcite .",
    "the structure of static and rotating bec stars was investigated numerically in @xcite by solving the gross - pitaevskii - poisson system of coupled differential equations .",
    "it was shown , with longer simulation runs , that within the computational limits of the simulation the bec stars are stable .",
    "the physical properties of the self - gravitating bose - einstein condensate were investigated in both non - rotating and rotating cases .",
    "a fundamental theoretical problem is to find some clear astrophysical signatures , going beyond the global stellar parameters ( mass and radius ) that could indicate the presence of a bec inside a neutron star , or to give a firm observational evidence for the existence of pure bec stars .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to suggest that such a specific signature , indicating the presence of a pure bec star , may indeed exist , and it can be obtained from the study of the radiation emission of thin accretion disks that usually form around compact general relativistic objects .",
    "the growth of most astrophysical objects is determined by mass accretion . due to the presence of interstellar matter",
    ", accretion disks are generally formed around compact objects .",
    "accretion disks are well known observationally , representing flattened astronomical structures .",
    "they are made of rapidly rotating hot gas , slowly spiraling onto a central massive and dense object .",
    "the gravitational energy of the gas motion is a source of heat , generated by the internal stresses and the dynamical friction .",
    "a small fraction of the heat is converted into radiation , which partially escapes .",
    "the radiation emission cools down the accretion disk .",
    "therefore important information about the accretion disk physics comes from the radiation emitted from the disk .",
    "the radiation , detected in the radio , optical or x - ray frequency bands , allows astronomers to analyze its electromagnetic spectrum , and its time variability .",
    "thus essential results about the physics of the disks can be obtained from observations .",
    "the cooling of the disk via the electromagnetic radiation emission from its surface represents an efficient mechanism that prevents the extreme heating of the disk . on the other hand ,",
    "the thermodynamic equilibrium established in this way allows the disk to stabilize its thin vertical size .",
    "usually the inner edge of the thin disk is located at the marginally stable orbit of the compact object potential .",
    "hence in higher orbits the hot gas has a keplerian motion @xcite . since the electromagnetic radiation emission from the thin disk",
    "is determined by the external gravitational potentials , which in turn are determined by the eos of the dense neutron or quark matter in the star , astrophysical observations of the emission spectra from accretion disks may lead to the possibility of directly testing the equation of state of the dense matter inside compact general relativistic objects .",
    "the emissivity properties of the accretion disks have been used to investigated , and obtain distinctive astrophysical signatures , for large classes of compact astrophysical objects , including naked singularities @xcite , gravastars @xcite and wormholes @xcite .",
    "specific electromagnetic disk signatures in different modified gravity theories , such as @xmath22 gravity , brane world models , chern - simons models and the horava - lifshitz theory were considered @xcite , while the properties of accretion disks around rotating and non - rotating neutron , quark , boson or fermion stars have been analyzed in @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we perform a comparative study of the rotational properties and of the disk emission properties for five neutron star eoss , and of the quark matter bag model eos with the polytropic @xmath13 bec equation of state .",
    "the main goal of this preliminary investigation is to point out towards the possible existence of some observational signatures that may distinguish between these different classes of compact objects .",
    "we begin our analysis by considering the global rotational properties of the considered compact objects . to obtain the equilibrium configurations of the rotating neutron , quark and bec stars we use the rotating neutron star ( rns ) code , as introduced in @xcite , and discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the rns software provides the metric potentials for different types of equations of state of compact rotating general relativistic objects .",
    "we investigate three different cases , corresponding to stellar models with fixed mass and angular velocity , stellar models rotating at keplerian frequencies , and stellar models with fixed central density and fixed polar radius to equatorial radius ratio . as a next step in our study",
    "we use the exterior metrics to obtain the physical properties of the accretion disks for the considered equations of state .",
    "particular signatures appear in the electromagnetic spectrum of the bec stars , thus leading to the theoretical possibility of directly testing , and discriminating , the bec equation of state of the dense matter by using astrophysical observations of the emission spectra from accretion disks .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sect1 ]",
    "we briefly review the basics of the bose - einstein condensation and discuss the properties of newtonian bec stars .",
    "the electromagnetic and thermodynamic properties of accretion disks around compact general relativistic objects are described in section  [ sect2 ] .",
    "the equations of state of the neutron , quark and bec matter , as well as the global astrophysical properties of the considered stellar models are obtained and discussed in section  [ sect3 ] .",
    "the electromagnetic and thermodynamic properties ( flux , luminosity and temperature distribution ) of the accretion disks around neutron , quark and bec stars are obtained in section  [ sect4 ] .",
    "we discuss our results and conclude our study in section  [ sect5 ] .",
    "the most important characteristic of a quantum system of @xmath23 interacting bosons in the condensed state is that most of the particles lie in the same single - particle quantum state . for a bosonic quantum system consisting of an extremely large number of particles ,",
    "the calculation of the physical parameters of the ground state with the direct use of the hamiltonian is generally very difficult , due to the high computational cost .",
    "a significant simplification of the many - body type computations can be achieved with the use of some approximate methods .",
    "one such approximate semi - analytic method is the mean field analysis of the quantum condensate .",
    "the basic idea of the mean field method is the separation of the bose - einstein condensate contribution to the total bosonic field operator . in the following in our analysis",
    "we assume that the bosonic astrophysical system consists of scalar ( zero spin ) particles with non - zero mass . from a simplifying physical point of view",
    "we assume that when the system makes a transition to a bose - einstein condensed phase , _ the range of van der waals - type scalar mediated interactions among particles becomes infinite_.      in the second quantization approach the hamiltonian describing a many body system of interacting bosons , confined by an external potential @xmath24 , is given by @xmath25 \\hat{\\phi}\\left ( \\vec{r}\\right ) + \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\frac{1}{2}\\int d\\vec{r}d% \\vec{r}^{\\prime } \\hat{\\phi}^{+}\\left ( \\vec{r}\\right ) \\hat{\\phi}^{+}\\left ( \\vec{r}^{\\prime } \\right ) v\\left ( \\vec{r}-\\vec{r}^{\\prime } \\right ) \\hat{\\phi}% \\left ( \\vec{r}\\right ) \\hat{\\phi}\\left ( \\vec{r}^{\\prime } \\right ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the bosonic field operators , and @xmath28 is the two - body interatomic potential , respectively @xcite-@xcite .",

    "have been developed .",

    "this is in general a poor approximation for computing the integral containing the particle - particle interaction @xmath42 .",
    "however , it is important to note that in a dilute and cold gas , at low energy only binary collisions are important .",
    "these collisions can be characterized , independently of the exact form of the two - body potential , by a single physical parameter , the @xmath43-wave scattering length @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , one can obtain a very good approximation by replacing the generally unknown potential @xmath45 with an effective interaction potential @xmath46 , with the coupling constant @xmath47 determined by the scattering length @xmath48 via the relation @xmath49 , where @xmath3 is the mass of the condensate particles . with the use of the effective potential the integral in the bracket of eq .",

    "hence the resulting approximate equation of motion for the condensate is the schrdinger equation with a quartic nonlinear term @xcite-@xcite , also called the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "however , in order to obtain a more general and realistic description of the bose - einstein condensate stars , one may also assume an arbitrary non - linear self - interaction term of the form @xmath51 @xcite .",

    "as for @xmath54 , we assume that it is the gravitational potential , denoted for simplicity by @xmath31 , @xmath55 .",
    "the gravitational potential satisfies the poisson equation of newtonian gravity @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the mass density inside the bose - einstein condensate .      the physical as well as the astrophysical properties of a bose - einstein condensate , described by the generalized gross - pitaevskii equation eq .",
    "( [ sch ] ) can be analyzed , computed and understood much more easily by using the so - called madelung representation of the wave function @xcite . in this representation",

    "thus it satisfies the condition @xmath69",
    ". therefore we obtain the important result that in the madelung representation the equations of motion of the bose - einstein condensate in a gravitational field take the form of the equation of continuity , and of the hydrodynamic euler equations , respectively .",
    "hence a bose - einstein condensate in an external gravitational field can be described as a gas whose density and pressure are related by a barotropic equation of state @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the exact form of the equation of state of the bec depends on the non - linearity term @xmath70 .    in the important case of a gravitationally bounded bose - einstein condensate with a very large number of particles",
    "the quantum pressure is important only near the external boundary of the quantum system .",
    "hence in all astrophysically important situations the quantum pressure term is much smaller than the non - linear interaction term @xcite . in the most studied approach to the bose - einstein condensates ,",
    "the non - linearity term @xmath70 is quadratic , and is given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the corresponding equation of state of the condensate is @xmath73 therefore we have obtained the very important result that the equation of state of the standard bose - einstein condensate with quartic non - linearity is a polytrope , with index @xmath13 .    in the following for simplicity",
    "we consider only the case of the bose - einstein condensates with quartic non - linearity . in this particular case",
    "the physical properties of the condensates are also relatively well known from numerous laboratory experiments . from theoretical point of view",
    "it is important to note that their properties can be described in terms of only two free parameters , the mass @xmath3 of the condensate particle , and the scattering length @xmath44 , describing the particle interaction , respectively .",
    "since the eos of a cold bec star is a polytrope of index @xmath13 , all the physical properties of the star can be derived from the well - known lane - emden equation , given by @xcite @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a dimensionless variable defined via @xmath76 , with @xmath77 the central density of the star , and @xmath78 is a dimensionless radial coordinate .",

    "note that the mass of the static condensate can be expressed in terms of the radius and central density by @xmath96 the above important equation shows that the mean density of the star @xmath97 can be obtained from the central density of the condensate by the simple relation @xmath98 .    under a scaling of the parameters @xmath3 , @xmath44 and @xmath99 so that @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , the radii and the masses of the newtonian bec stars have the scaling properties @xcite , @xmath103    it is important to point out that general relativistic effects impose strong constraints on the structure and global parameters of the bec stars , and that the values obtained by the simple newtonian estimates may highly exceed the stability limit imposed by the general relativistic analysis .",
    "in order to investigate the accretion disk properties around neutron , quark and bec stars we first briefly introduce the general formalism that allows us to describe the electromagnetic radiation properties of thin accretion disks in stationary axisymmetric spacetimes . in our presentation",

    "[ fig10 ] , the fluxes can be classified in three groups , having high flux values ( eoss q and apr ) , medium values ( eoss rmfstiff , rmfsoft , stos0 , dh , bbbav14 , bbbparis ) , and low flux values , with all the bec eoss belonging to this latter group .",
    "it is interesting to note that for all bec eoss the maximum value of the flux has ( approximately ) the same value .",
    "however , these maxima are located at different @xmath320 , with the maximum of the bec15 eos positioned at around @xmath321 from the central object .",
    "the maximum value of the flux of the bec stars is around three to four times lower than from the stars in the first group , with maximum fluxes ( eoss q and apr ) , and around two times smaller as compared to the maximum flux values for the eoss of the second group .",
    "the temperature distribution , shown in fig .  [ fig11 ] , follows the same pattern as the flux , with the maximum of the disk temperature situated at around @xmath322 for eos bec15 .",
    "the maximum temperature value is very similar for all three bec equations of state .",
    "the luminosities of the disks , plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] , shows that the maximum of the function @xmath323 is reached at roughly the same frequency for all considered eoss .",
    "however , there is a clear theoretical difference in the absolute value of the luminosity maximum , with the bec15 eos having the smallest luminosity .",
    "even that eoss bec 50 and bec30 have disk luminosities comparable with some neutron star models , they still belong to the class of low luminosity disks .",
    "an important observable physical parameter of the disk , which could help to observationally distinguish between different classes of neutron , quark and bec stars , is the efficiency @xmath179 of the conversion of the accreting mass into radiation , given by eq .",
    "( [ epsilon ] ) .",
    "the numerical values of @xmath179 show the efficiency of the energy generating mechanism of the mass accretion @xcite . from a physical point of view , the binding energy @xmath324 , or @xmath325 , represents the amount of energy released by the matter leaving the marginally stable orbit , or the inner edge of the disk , touching the surface of the star , and being transferred to the star .",
    "the radii of the inner disk edges for different equation of state and the efficiency of the radiation emission is presented , for the three stellar models considered in the present paper , in table  [ table4 ] .",
    "the first two lines of table  [ table4 ] contain the conversion efficiency of the compact neutron , quark and bec stars rotating at keplerian frequencies . in this case the values of @xmath178 for the bec stars are in the range of 5% to 8% , having values comparable to the @xmath178 values for neutron and quark stars .",
    "the highest efficiency , 9% , is obtained for the stos0 eos , while the bec50 eos has a conversion efficiency close to that of the quark stars .",
    "the smallest @xmath178 value is obtained for the bec15 eos , showing that these stars are less efficient engines for the conversion of the accreted mass into outgoing radiation .",
    "the values of @xmath178 for the compact general relativistic objects with fixed central density and @xmath265 are given in the second two lines of table  [ table4 ] .",
    "the values of @xmath178 are slightly lower , as compared to the keplerian rotation case , with the highest value for @xmath178 obtained for the stos0 eos .",
    "the smallest value of @xmath178 is found for the bec15 eos .",
    "however , in this case the efficiency of the bec50 eos is significantly smaller than the efficiency of the q eos , being slightly higher than @xmath178 for apr eos .",
    "the last two lines in table  [ table4 ] show the numerical values of @xmath179 for disks around compact objects with mass @xmath326 , rotating with an angular velocity of @xmath286 s@xmath287 .",
    "while the efficiency of the radiation conversion is almost the same for eoss apr , bbbav14 , bbbparis , dh , q , rmfsoft , and rmfstiff , it has some lower values for the bec15 eos , and much lower values for eoss bec30 and bec50 .",
    "relatively low values have been also obtained for the stos0 eos .",
    "the efficiencies of 3.89% obtained for the bec15 and bec50 stars are the lowest accretion disk efficiencies obtained in the present study .",
    "the inner edges of the accretion disks around bec stars are located at a much bigger distance from the central object as compared to the other classes of neutron and quark stars , reaching a value of 31 km for the bec50 eos .",
    "such a far away located inner edge does explain the low efficiency of the corresponding accretion disk .",
    "the possible existence of some forms of bose - einstein condensates in compact general relativistic objects , or the existence of pure bose - einstein condensate stars , represents an intriguing , and interesting , possibility , for which a lot of theoretical evidence has been provided . from an observational point of view the most important differences between standard neutron or quark stars",
    "are represented by the differences in mass and radius .",
    "if the masses and radii of the compact general relativistic object could be measured with high accuracy , these measurements would put very strong _ direct _ constraints on the equation of state of the dense star .",
    "however , presently , there are very few precise determinations of both the mass and radius of a compact object . therefore ,",
    "in the present paper we have proposed , and preliminary investigated , an alternative _ indirect _ method , that could help observationally distinguishing between different classes of compact objects , and their equations of state .",
    "this method is based on the information extracted from observations of the basic physical properties of matter forming thin accretion disks around rapidly rotating neutron , quark and bose - einstein condensate stars .    due to the presence of a strong gravitational field ,",
    "all the astrophysical quantities related to the observable properties of the accretion disks , are dependent , and can be obtained from the metric of the central compact object @xcite . due to the major differences in the exterior space - time geometry , neutron , quark and bose - einstein condensate stars show , at least on the theoretical level , some very important distinct signatures with respect to the disk properties .",
    "therefore , the observational procedure of the analysis of the electromagnetic radiation of accretion disks may allow to discriminate between neutron , quark and bose - einstein condensate stars , by giving some specific distinct signatures that could differentiate between compact objects described by different equations of state .",
    "in the present paper we have obtained the physical parameters of the disk - effective potential , flux and emission spectrum profiles - for several equations of state of the neutron , quark and bec matter , respectively .    as one can see from the flux integral in eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) , as well as from the explicit expressions of the specific energy , specific angular momentum and angular velocity , given by eqs .",
    "( [ rote ] ) , ( [ rotl ] ) and ( [ rotomega ] ) , respectively , the rather different characteristics of the radial flux distribution over the accretion disk , the disk spectra and the conversion efficiency are due to the important differences between the metric potentials of the neutron , quark and bose - einstein condensate stars , respectively . even if the total mass and the angular velocity are the same for each type of the rotating central object ( neutron , quark or bose - einstein condensate star ) , with the stars having similar values of @xmath327 , @xmath328 and @xmath329 , the radiation properties of the accretion disks around these compact general relativistic objects exhibit observable differences @xcite .",
    "the physical reason for these differences is that the proper volume , and in turn the function @xmath112 , used in the calculation of the flux integral , is strongly dependent on the behavior of the metric component @xmath330 , and therefore on the geometry of the space - time .",
    "the latter expression contains the derivatives with respect to the radial coordinate @xmath111 of the metric components @xmath331 and @xmath332 , respectively , via the coordinate transformation between the coordinates @xmath333 and @xmath111 , which are extremely sensitive to the slope of the functions @xmath331 and @xmath332 @xcite .",
    "therefore , although the inner edges of the disks are located at almost the same radii , the maximum amplitudes and the numerical values of the energy fluxes emerging form the disk surface , and propagating in any solid angle , may show considerable differences for different equations of state of the neutron , quark and bose - einstein condensate matter .",
    "these essentially geometrical effects also give the distinctive features in the disk spectra for the various types of central stars .    in our preliminary and idealized theoretical study of the accretion disk properties around bose - einstein condensate stars",
    "we have found a number of observational signatures distinguishing this class of stars from the neutron and quark stars .",
    "these specific properties are the distinct positions of the maxima of the flux , of the temperature distribution , and of the luminosity of the disk , the position of the inner edge of the disk , and the radiation efficiency conversion . in all three different classes of rotating stars",
    "we have analyzed these signatures do appear distinctly . moreover ,",
    "bose - einstein condensate stars have a mass - radius relation that can also help in discriminating them with respect to other classes of neutron and quark stars .    in the present paper , which represents a first step in the investigation of the complex astrophysical problem of the radiation emission from accretion disks around compact objects with different nuclear equations of state",
    ", we made the fundamental assumption that the inner edge of the disk is located at the isco radius .",
    "this means that the isco position is only determined by the space - time geometry around the compact object .",
    "however , a number of important physical factors can affect the position and location of the inner edge of the disk .",
    "for example , in the case of neutron stars , the inner edge of the disk is usually set by the magnetosphere around the star , and it is not determined by the metric of the space - time only .",
    "but , in order to simplify the discussion of the complex physics of the accretion disks , and by taking into account the preliminary and purely theoretical nature of this study , in the present paper we consider only an ideal case , which allows us to start our analysis from very simple physical and astrophysical considerations .",
    "as already mentioned , an important physical parameter that strongly influences the isco position is the magnetic field of the compact central object , and its magnetosphere .",
    "the magnetic field lines originating from the central object can have a considerable effect on the evolution of the on the accretion processes , and on the disk structure .",
    "the effects of magnetic fields on the accretion processes in a compact , spherically symmetric geometry of schwarzschild type ( which describes the exterior geometry for both black holes and compact stars ) were considered in @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field was assumed to be asymptotically uniform , and axisymmetric tidal structures were also taken into account . due to the presence of the magnetic field and of the tidal perturbations , the accretion disk shrinks in size , and the marginally stable orbits shift towards the central object .",
    "on the other hand the presence of the magnetic perturbation leads to an increase in the disk radiation intensity from the accretion disk .",
    "however , the position of the maximum of the radiation does not change , and the radiation spectrum is blue - shifted . interestingly , the conversion efficiency decreases due to the presence of the magnetic fields and of the tidal perturbations .",
    "alternative studies of the effects of the neutron star s magnetic field on the exterior metric and the position of isco s can be found in @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we have proposed a method for discriminating between different types of compact objects that was proposed , and observationally tested , in the case of the black holes .",
    "black holes have an event horizon ( or a very special surface with similar properties ) that prevent them to emit any form of electromagnetic radiation @xcite .",
    "this makes the radiation emission from the disk , and due to accretion processes , to be the dominant electromagnetic energy emission mechanism , thus allowing the possibility of determining the central black hole properties from the radiation spectrum of the disk , without any possible interference of the electromagnetic signals from the black hole . on the other hand ,",
    "neutron stars have a solid radiation emitting surface ( crust ) , which makes very difficult to distinguish between the radiation of the star and of the disk itself .",
    "that s why the continuum - fitting method was not applied for the study of neutron stars @xcite , and up to now there is no published observational study of the possibility of testing the neutron star equation of state by using the electromagnetic spectrum of a thin disk . on the other hand we would like to point out that the electromagnetic emissivity of the zero temperature gravitationally bounded bose - einstein condensate matter , in which all particles are in the quantum ground state , described by a single wave function , is very low @xcite .",
    "this is because the effective plasma frequency of the condensed mater is very high .",
    "therefore we may assume that the radiation emissivity of the bec stars is very low , and they are very `` black '' .",
    "consequently , the electromagnetic emissivity of the bec star - disk system may be dominated by the disk emission .",
    "this situation is similar to the case of quark stars .",
    "since quark matter has a very high plasma frequency @xmath334 , the photon emissivity of strange quark stars is very low @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the propagation of electromagnetic waves having frequencies lower than @xmath334 is exponentially damped .",
    "hence , only photons produced just below a few fermi from the surface , with outwards pointing momenta can be emitted by the strange star .",
    "hence the equilibrium photon emissivity from a strange star is negligible small , as compared to the black body one .",
    "moreover , the spectrum of the emitted equilibrium photons is very hard , with @xmath335 mev @xcite . of course bec stars , as well as the quark stars , may have a crust ( solid surface ) , representing a powerful source of electromagnetic radiation .",
    "the presence of such a crust would further complicate the possibility of discriminating between bec stars and the other types of compact general relativistic objects .",
    "another important point we would like to stress is that from an observational point of view not all the parameters of the bec star - disk system can be determined independently from astrophysical observations .",
    "this means that a degeneracy between the equation of state and the nature of the compact object , and the values of some physical parameters of the model , could always exist .",
    "a full test of the bec equation of state would require the precise knowledge of the mass , radius , and spin of the central object , as well as all the electromagnetic disk properties . in this ideal case ,",
    "extremely difficult to be achieved from observational point of view , the fitting of the observational data could provide a convincing test of the nature of the central object . probably in the near future no such increase in the precision of the astrophysical observations will be achieved , thus making the direct determination of the eos of the nuclear or condensed matter to be beyond the present observational capabilities . on the other hand one could expect an increase in the determination of the masses and radii for various compact objects , and these measurements may give some hints on the true nature of the equation of state of the dense matter .    in conclusion ,",
    "once the precision of the astrophysical data is drastically increased , the observational study of the thin accretion disks around rapidly rotating compact objects , and of their electromagnetic properties ( flux , temperature distribution and luminosity ) , may provide a powerful tool in distinguishing between different classes of dense stellar objects , as well as for discriminating between the different equations of state of the dense matter .",

    "<S> due to their superfluid properties some compact astrophysical objects , like neutron or quark stars , may contain a significant part of their matter in the form of a bose - einstein condensate . </S>",
    "<S> observationally distinguishing between neutron / quark stars and bose - einstein condensate stars is a major challenge for this latter theoretical model . </S>",
    "<S> an observational possibility of indirectly distinguishing bose - einstein condensate stars from neutron / quark stars is through the study of the thin accretion disks around compact general relativistic objects . in the present paper , </S>",
    "<S> we perform a detailed comparative study of the electromagnetic and thermodynamic properties of the thin accretion disks around rapidly rotating bose - einstein condensate stars , neutron stars and quark stars , respectively . due to the differences in the exterior geometry , </S>",
    "<S> the thermodynamic and electromagnetic properties of the disks ( energy flux , temperature distribution , equilibrium radiation spectrum and efficiency of energy conversion ) are different for these classes of compact objects . </S>",
    "<S> hence in this preliminary study we have pointed out some astrophysical signatures that may allow to observationally discriminate between bose - einstein condensate stars and neutron / quark stars , respectively . </S>"
