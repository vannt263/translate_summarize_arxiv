    "supernovae and hypernovae are among the most spectacular events in the observable universe with an enormous amount of energy involved .",
    "numerous studies have been undertaken to understand their mechanisms , for recent reviews , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein . at the origin of an iron core - collapse supernovae",
    "is the gravitational collapse of the core of a massive progenitor star exceeding its chandrasekhar mass .",
    "the induced electron captures , reducing the degeneracy pressure of the core , enable the collapse to proceed until the matter density is high enough for nuclear forces to become repulsive .",
    "this is the case when , roughly , nuclear matter saturation density has been reached . at this point ,",
    "a bounce occurs , leaving a compact remnant  : a proto - neutron star ( pns ) , or possibly a black hole ( bh ) .",
    "the bounce creates a shock that propagates outwards and soon stalls , having lost a lot of energy in photodissociation of iron group nuclei within the infalling material .",
    "the shock is known to stall in the semi - transparent regime , where the neutrinos are decoupled from the fluid but can still interact .",
    "in particular , they deposit energy behind the shock via charged - current interactions .",
    "while the collapse , bounce and prompt shock propagation phases seem to be well reproduced by spherically symmetric simulations , it is now widely admitted that the late phases are deeply multidimensional .    over decades",
    "much effort has been devoted to numerical simulations in order to gain physical insight .",
    "increasing computer power and refined models have lead , in recent years , to considerable progress in understanding , in particular , the supernova explosion mechanism using multidimensional models .",
    "indeed , aided by convection ( e.g. @xcite ) and the standing accretion shock instability ( sasi ) @xcite , several authors reported explosions by the neutrino heating mechanism in 2d or 3d ( e.g. @xcite ) . although some drawbacks still exist , for instance the reported explosion energies are low ( @xmath1 compared with the canonical observed value of @xmath2 ) , reviving the shock by depositing neutrino energy in the gain layer in a multidimensional simulation seems to be a promising way to finally make the supernovae explode ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , other mechanisms like the acoustic mechanism ( e.g. @xcite ) or the qcd phase transition mechanism @xcite can not be excluded .",
    "the mhd mechanism ( e.g. @xcite ) could also account for the explosion of rapidly rotating , highly magnetized cores and lead to luminous supernovae or hypernovae .",
    "black hole formation has been intensely investigated ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . a simulation",
    "in which the shock is not able to recover positive velocities and to break through the infalling material from the progenitor leads to the formation of a bh , which often swallows the entire progenitor  @xcite .",
    "this is often referred to as a failed supernova .",
    "neutrino emission in failed supernovae simulations stops abruptly when the emission region enters the apparent horizon , as one could expect .",
    "this gives a good criterion to discriminate between bh formation and neutron star formation in an upcoming neutrino signal  @xcite .",
    "due to larger accretion rates , failed supernovae simulations are also known to explore higher densities and temperatures than their exploding counterparts , which makes them a tool to explore finite temperature equations of state ( eoss ) at supranuclear density .",
    "the eos remains one of the uncertainties in a stellar core - collapse numerical simulation .",
    "the vast majority of simulations employs either the h.shen _ et al .",
    "_  eos ( hshen , @xcite ) or the lattimer and swesty eos ( ls , @xcite ) .",
    "both of them assume the same particle content : free nucleons , @xmath3-particles , one ( representative ) heavy nucleus , electrons , positrons and photons . concerning the nuclear interaction , the hshen eos",
    "is based on a relativistic mean field model with a thomas  fermi approximation for the description of the inhomogeneous part , while the ls eos uses a non - relativistic skyrme - type model with a simplified momentum - independent nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "the latter eos is further described in sec .",
    "[ section : eos ] .",
    "eos dependence has been studied since many years with , in particular , studies of the effects of incompressibility in ls eos  @xcite , or differences between hshen and ls for bh formation  @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been shown  @xcite that differences in the nuclear properties can account for differences in the resulting hydrodynamics , specifically the predicted central density , pressure or compactness of the proto - neutron star .",
    "et al _  @xcite have also shown that there is a difference in the gain layer where convection is triggered and the simulations behave differently , qualitatively and quantitatively .",
    "these differences can be large enough to govern the presence of an explosion .",
    "some other finite temperature eoss are available , especially recent ones ( e.g. @xcite ) , focusing on improvements in the subsaturation regime . in this paper",
    ", we focus on a different aspect , not included in the standard eoss , namely the presence of additional particles at high densities and temperatures .",
    "it is natural and widely accepted that additional particles should appear in matter at densities above roughly nuclear matter saturation density  @xcite .",
    "the high temperatures during core - collapse are in favor of the population of these additional states .",
    "supernovae simulations with pions and hyperons added to the hshen eos were reported in ishizuka _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , sumiyoshi _ et al _",
    "@xcite and nakazato _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "the results show in particular that the time from bounce to bh collapse is shortened by the presence of pions and/or hyperons .",
    "the neutrino signal is hardly , or not at all changed , except for the fact that the duration of the signal is shorter due to earlier collapse to a bh .",
    "the reason is that pions and hyperons appear only deep inside the pns .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite show in addition that a variation of the coupling parameters of hyperons have only very little influence on these qualitative results .",
    "we extend this work to the other commonly used eos , the ls eos .",
    "we discuss two extensions of the ls eos : one including a free pion gas and another one including the @xmath0-hyperon .",
    "unfortunately , very few constraints on the interactions of these particles exist , be it from nuclear physics experiments or astronomical observations .",
    "the most stringent one at the moment is probably the observation of an almost @xmath4 neutron star  @xcite , a mass measured with high precision by shapiro delay .",
    "many eoss including additional particles , in particular hyperons , are in contradiction with this observation due to a too strong softening of the eos .",
    "for instance , with the hshen eos + @xmath0  @xcite only a maximum neutron star mass of @xmath5 is obtained . with the ishizuka _",
    "_ eoss @xcite , the maximum masses for their eoss with different parameterizations of hyperons , muons and pions are @xmath6 and @xmath7 . our extensions of the ls eos have been described in detail in  @xcite , where it was shown in particular that it is possible , including hyperons in the eos , to fulfill the constraint from the @xmath8 neutron star measurement together with the available experimental constraints on hyperon couplings . in sec .",
    "[ section : eos ] we shall introduce the eoss models we are employing .    our simple neutrino treatment does not allow to extract an energy - resolved neutrino signal , we thus only discuss some results for integrated luminosities and we will concentrate the discussion on the time between bounce and black hole collapse as well as on the properties of the different pnss .",

    "we adopt the einstein summation convention , too .",
    "we perform a series of numerical simulations using the coconut code in spherical symmetry .",
    "note that the code can be run in 2d/3d too , but due to the very long simulation times , we restrict ourselves to 1d simulations",
    ". nevertheless , the model and equations presented here could be in principle applied to 2d or 3d cases , without any loss of generality .",
    "since details are already available in the literature @xcite , in this section we only briefly describe the equations solved by the code .",

    "general relativity ( gr ) is used through the 3 + 1 approach ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) , where the 4-metric @xmath11 is described by the lapse function @xmath3 , the shift 3-vector @xmath12 and the spatial 3-metric @xmath13 .",
    "the line element is then written as    @xmath14    here we use the isotropic gauge , in which the 3-metric is written as    @xmath15    with @xmath16 denoting the flat - space 3-metric and @xmath17 the conformal factor .",
    "although this gauge choice is fully valid in spherical symmetry , it is denoted as _ conformally flat condition _",

    "this approximation misses some aspects of gr ( it does not contain gravitational waves , it can not exactly describe a kerr black hole or a rotating fluid configuration ) , but it has been proven to be a very good approximation in the case of core - collapse simulations @xcite .    assuming here a perfect fluid with 4-velocity @xmath18 and baryon number density @xmath19 , we can define a 4-current as @xmath20 . for convenience , coconut works with the fluid density @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the neutron mass , so that the 4-current reads    @xmath23    the stress - energy tensor is given by @xmath24 with @xmath25 being the fluid pressure and @xmath26 the specific enthalpy ; @xmath27 is here the energy density of the fluid .",

    "the electron fraction @xmath30 , electron neutrino fraction @xmath31 and electron antineutrino fraction @xmath32 enter separately three advection equations , which are included hereafter in a conservative - like form .",
    "no advection equation has been introduced for @xmath33 , with @xmath34 standing for muon and tau neutrinos . before bounce",
    ", @xmath33 vanishes to a very good approximation , because of the absence of charged - current production processes due to the lack of heavy charged leptons .",
    "the only production channels are pair productions ( see sec .",
    "[ sss : nu_creation ] ) which start to play a role in the hot environment close to and after bounce . after bounce , we determine @xmath33 from the integration of the fermi - dirac distribution with zero chemical potential for the @xmath35 , thus assuming thermally equilibrated @xmath35 .",
    "this simplification saves some computational time and should not have any major influence on our results , since non - electronic neutrinos are much less abundant than electronic ones .",
    "non - electronic neutrinos have thus only little effect on the overall dynamics compared with the electronic ones ( see e.g.  @xcite , where the dynamics of a full boltzmann simulation is well reproduced by a simplified simulation with no @xmath35 ) .",
    "the 3 + 1 formalism slices the four - dimensional spacetime by three - dimensional spacelike hypersurfaces , and it is therefore particularly well adapted to describe hydrodynamics with respect to a eulerian observer , which moves orthogonally to these spacelike hypersurfaces with a 4-velocity @xmath36 . the @xmath37 decomposition of the stress - energy tensor reads @xmath38 @xmath39 being the matter energy density , @xmath40 the matter momentum density , and @xmath41 the matter stress tensor , all measured by the eulerian observer .",

    "note that this approach is not bound to the spherically - symmetric case ( see  @xcite in the 3d and cfc case ) .",
    "we use the apparent horizon ( ah ) finder described in details in @xcite . in a simulation , a pns accretes mass and looses energy due to neutrinos at the same time .",
    "this enables the pns to further contract , and consequently the density increases .",
    "at some point , depending on the eos , the pns becomes gravitationally unstable and collapses to a bh .",
    "the bh collapse is unambiguous , as density , temperature , pressure , internal energy all increase very rapidly .",
    "since the lapse is decreasing from @xmath82 in the newtonian limit to zero at the center , some authors just take a given value @xmath83 of the lapse as a criterion for bh formation ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . however , using an ah finder that detects a marginally trapped surface is a more rigorous way to treat bh formation .",
    "in addition , the ah finder enters a simulation only at the very end , when bh collapse begun , triggered by a chosen value for the conformal factor at the center ( typically , @xmath84 ) , it is thus computationally cheap .",
    "we employ two different 40 @xmath85 ( zero - age main sequence ( zams ) mass ) progenitors . as a first progenitor model",
    ", we have chosen a star with low metalicity ( @xmath86 solar ) from woosley , heger , and weaver  @xcite ( hereafter u40 ) .",
    "the low metalicity leads to a much higher accretion rate after bounce compared with a solar metalicity star . therefore , even though there still are many unknowns concerning the fate of a particular progenitor ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , very massive stars with low metalicity are widely accepted as good candidates for bh formation .",
    "the second one , from woosley and weaver  @xcite ( hereafter wws40 ) , has solar metalicity .",
    "this progenitor was widely used in bh collapse studies ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and we use it here mainly for comparison purposes .",
    "it is believed to collapse to a bh , as the accretion rate is too high and the iron core is too massive for the star to explode .",
    "let us stress , however , that ugliano _",
    "@xcite report that the @xmath87 progenitor with solar metalicity from woosley , heger , and weaver  @xcite , does explode and leaves a ns rather than a bh .",
    "the reason is probably that it has a smaller accretion rate than its counterpart from  @xcite , a difference that may come from the different treatment of the mass loss .      in the central region ,",
    "i.e. mainly within the hot pns , very high densities ( roughly above nuclear saturation ) and temperatures ( several tens of mev ) are reached . under these conditions , the particle content of the standard nuclear eos such as the hshen eos or",
    "the ls eos is possibly not sufficient .",
    "as already mentioned , the latter models the matter as a mixture of one ( average ) heavy nucleus , @xmath3-particles , free nucleons , electrons , positrons and photons . additional particles , such as thermal pions , hyperons , or nuclear resonances should appear .",
    "even a qcd phase transition is conceivable  @xcite . in the last years",
    "some work in this direction has begun , extending the hshen eos to include pions or hyperons , see e.g.  @xcite , or quarks , see  @xcite .",

    "then , without scattering off @xmath0 , the phase transition occurs @xmath88  ms later , and the pns maximum mass becomes @xmath89 .",
    "this is a reduction of @xmath90 compared with the case including @xmath0-scattering .",
    "this reduction of the maximum mass suggests that cooling is more important when we reduce the opacity by neglecting scattering off @xmath0-hyperons , as expected .",
    "however , the reduction is within the error bars of the code , so this conclusion should be taken with some care .",
    "we note that although @xmath0-hyperons are abundant , they appear in a medium that is already optically thick .",
    "this could explain why the @xmath0-scattering is not very important .",

    "the generalization to 3d would involve a lorentz boost in an arbitrary direction and the complete shift vector .",
    "the neutrino luminosity can be found by integrating the energy rate on an invariant volume element at constant time , which justifies the @xmath95 term .",
    "this formula agrees with @xcite .",
    "note that the integration at constant time is an approximation , since a time delay between the different emitting regions should exist .",
    "but because the overall emitting region is narrow ( @xmath96 km at most ) , this approximation should be well justified .    as already reported by different authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the total neutrino luminosity peaks at the neutrino burst , a few milliseconds after the bounce , and decreases very rapidly afterwards .",
    "we observe the same behavior ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : l_nu ] and the discussion for the wws40 progenitor in sec .",
    "[ sect : ww40 ] ) , and the luminosity for models lsu40 and @xmath97u40 are very similar .",
    "only @xmath0u40 shows a different trend .",
    "the neutrino burst peak luminosity is higher , and because the pns shrinks very rapidly , high neutrino emission after bounce is more sustained with the model @xmath0u40 . as a result , the luminosity decrease after the neutrino burst is slower in this model .",
    "moreover , after the phase transition the luminosity follows the pns behavior ( illustrated by the central density plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho_c_t_lambda ] ) , and oscillates , which makes the pns loose a lot of energy .",
    "the differences in luminosity between ls220 eos and @xmath0eos have to be checked with a better neutrino treatment to infer the detectability of the ls220 + @xmath0 eos peculiarities .",
    "in addition , the detection of pns modes could be linked to a physical process different from the phase transition , and it would be hard to disentangle on a neutrino light curve .    finally , at bh formation , the emitting region enters the horizon and the luminosity drops down abruptly .      within this section",

    "we find a maximum pns mass of @xmath99 . compared with previous work  @xcite",
    ", this value agrees within about @xmath100 , and may be slightly overestimated .",
    "other authors @xcite often use a lower value of the coefficient of nuclear incompressibility , namely @xmath101 , while we use @xmath102 .",
    "this significantly changes the maximum mass that the pns can hold and thus , comparisons are more difficult .",
    "the model lsww40 forms an ah at @xmath103  ms post - bounce , while the model @xmath97ww40 collapses earlier , and an ah is detected at @xmath104  ms , for a maximum pns mass of @xmath105 .",
    "we note that the addition of pions leads to larger changes in the properties at bh collapse for wws40 than for u40 ( see tab .",
    "[ table : prop ] ) .",
    "we may interpret this as follows : because the pns contracts more when using ls220+@xmath97 eos , the neutrinosphere is closer to the center and so , cooling is more effective . because accretion rate is lower with the wws40 progenitor , more time is needed to reach the pns maximum mass .",
    "hence , the more effective cooling lasts longer and differences between models using ls220+@xmath97 eos and ls220 eos are more pronounced .",

    "as expected , additional degrees of freedom modify the eos properties , in such a way that the collapse to a black hole occurs sooner after the bounce .",
    "our new eoss are based on the lattimer and swesty eos .",
    "pions are added as a free gas , and @xmath0-hyperons are incorporated with the interactions adapted from balberg and gal  @xcite .",
    "this eos is subject to a first - order phase transition driven by @xmath0-hyperons  @xcite which is described by a gibbs construction .",
    "the ls220+@xmath97 eos fulfills the gravitational mass constraint from the @xmath115 neutron star , and the ls220+@xmath0 eos is very slightly below with a maximum mass of @xmath116 .",
    "compared to previous works , h.shen _ et al . _",

    "@xcite reported a maximum mass of @xmath118 and @xmath7 for their eoss that include different parameterizations of hyperons , muons and pions .",
    "so , the eoss presented in this paper are in better agreement with observational mass constraints .",
    "we have implemented a new leakage scheme . compared with previous works , we keep track of the neutrino fractions more accurately with advection equations , and",
    "take into account neutrinos that are not trapped anymore because of the neutrinosphere moving inwards .",
    "although our fluid rest frame source terms are approximated , we consistently transform them to the eulerian frame , where the hydrodynamic equations are solved . with these refinements ,",
    "it is possible to follow a simulation during the collapse , bounce and post - bounce phases without changing the approach .",
    "when using the ls220+@xmath0 eos , we have implemented for the first time the isoenergetic scattering off a @xmath0-hyperon .",
    "it is done in a simplified manner consistent with our other opacity sources , and we find that it shifts the occurrence of the phase transition by @xmath88 ms and the pns maximum baryonic mass is @xmath90 smaller with this opacity taken into account .",
    "this contribution is still very subdominant compared with scattering off nucleons .",
    "our use of the leakage scheme during the collapse phase enabled us to see differences in the deleptonization , which resulted in a smaller density at bounce for model @xmath97u40 and @xmath97ww40 , compared to lsu40 and lsww40 , respectively . with both progenitors ,",
    "we find , as expected , that the compression of the pns is faster when using the ls220+@xmath97 eos .",
    "the reduction of the pns maximum baryonic mass is @xmath119 for model @xmath97u40 compared to model lsu40 .",
    "a larger difference of @xmath120 is found when comparing models @xmath97ww40 and lsww40 .",
    "we interpret the larger difference as a result of the larger amount of time spent in the post - bounce cooling regime .",
    "small differences between eoss have thus more time to develop .    with the u40 progenitor and the ls220+@xmath0 eos , a phase transition clearly appears .",
    "contrary to the cold @xmath0 eos , at finite temperature @xmath0-hyperons begin to appear before the phase transition , and the fraction of thermally populated @xmath0-hyperons is significant ( @xmath121 at the center before the phase transition ) .",
    "the phase transition results in a sudden increase in density , comparable to the free fall during the initial collapse .",
    "in contrast to model @xmath0u40 , with model @xmath0ww40 we do not observe the phase transition .",
    "we find that up to the onset of bh collapse , the density stays too low to trigger the phase transition .",
    "consequently , the appearance of @xmath0-hyperons is entirely due to thermal effects .",
    "we conclude that our models with ls220+@xmath0 eos do not predict a phase transition for every progenitor .",
    "indeed , only the progenitors with the highest accretion rates are able to reach the phase transition density before the onset of bh collapse .    apart from the lack of the phase transition , the wws40 progenitor has the same qualitative behavior as u40 .",
    "our results with model lsww40 are in agreement with previous work with the same progenitor and the same eos @xcite .",
    "the ls220+@xmath97 eos collapses to bh earlier than the ls220 eos , admitting a lower pns maximum mass .",
    "ls220+@xmath0 eos also leads to a more compressible pns , and the effect is much more pronounced .",
    "the pns maximum mass is found to be @xmath122 .",
    "thus , we addressed the question of additional particles in hot eoss .",
    "it seems that adding pions or @xmath0-hyperons can significantly change the conditions of a core - collapse supernova , while still being in agreement with the @xmath115 neutron star .",
    "because we see differences already at bounce , and because the neutrino luminosity is higher when adding @xmath0-hyperons , one could infer that additional particles may make a difference in the explosion phase .",
    "this will have to be investigated with a more detailed neutrino treatment .",
    "the present eos with @xmath0-hyperons is only marginally compatible with the mass of psr j 1614 - 2230 and the question arises to which extent our results would be modified by taking another eos giving a higher maximum neutron star mass .",
    "as far as the same model is used , e.g. with one of the parameter sets from ref .",
    "@xcite , no qualitative changes are to be expected . indeed , as can be seen from ref .",
    "@xcite , the behavior of the hyperonic eos with different parameterizations are very similar .",
    "more pronounced modifications are of course to be expected if a future observation gives an even higher neutron star mass and another model has to be used ( remind that ls220 eos without additional particles has a maximum mass of only 2.06 m@xmath123 ) .",
    "the general effect of reduced time to black hole collapse in presence of additional particles seems , however , very robust , since we confirm the results from  @xcite which have been obtained using an extended version of the hshen eos , thus a different model for dense matter .",
    "further studies on observational consequences of the appearance of hyperons or pions are yet to be done .",
    "in particular , the phase transition should produce copious amount of gravitational waves , as it has been shown by previous studies on `` mini - collapses ''  @xcite .",
    "a future study shall use simulations of rotating stellar core collapse with pion and hyperon eos , in order to infer the gravitational wave signal .",
    "on the other hand , our estimation of neutrino luminosity suggests that the pns radial modes might be detectable , although it would be hard to unambiguously associate it to a phase transition to hyperonic matter , also because other phase transitions ( e.g. to quark matter  @xcite ) are possible .",
    "so , it seems possible to detect evidences of the phase transition in an ideal case , combining observations of neutrinos and gravitational waves from core - collapse to a bh , even without constraining the nature of the phase transition from these data .",
    "our work on modern eoss including pions and @xmath0-hyperons raises the question of the impact of the other additional particles that we did not consider . in the long run",
    ", it will be desirable to build an eos with @xmath97 , @xmath0 but also other hyperons ( @xmath124 , @xmath125 ) , and muons .",
    "this eos would have to fulfill the mass constraint and consistently take into account interactions between particles .",
    "coupling it to an accurate neutrino transport scheme , taking into account neutrino reactions with the new particles is the only way to have accurate quantitative results on the influence of additional particles . in the mean time",
    ", modern nuclear and astrophysical data should restrict more and more the set of compatible parameters , which will help building a realistic eos .",
