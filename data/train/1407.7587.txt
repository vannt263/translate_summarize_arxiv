    "in order to fix ideas we considered first a simple model @xcite for a soft confined atom obeying a schrdinger equation in @xmath2 dimensions of the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is an attractive central potential with coulomb and confining terms . if we assume a wave function of the form @xmath5 then we find the radial eigenequation implies @xmath6 if we now choose @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 we obtain the following family of exact solutions @xmath10 the lowest radial excitations of the familiar coulomb and oscillator problems are recovered from the special cases @xmath11 or @xmath12 such specific exact solutions allow for analytical reasoning and explorations . in addition , the explicit results provide relevant test problems for the complementary approaches that must be used to complete the solution space .",
    "the question of the existence of exact solutions and the methods for finding them are therefore an important part of the overall task . as in the choice of the function @xmath13 in the simple illustration above , it is often the case in this context that exactness has something to do with polynomials .",
    "thus part of the paper involves the issue of when an ordinary differential equation admits polynomial solutions . as we shall see ,",
    "the ` asymptotic iteration method ' @xcite plays a role both in the construction of exact solutions and also in finding approximations for arbitrary values of the problem parameters .        in the present work we study the exact and approximate solutions of the schrdinger eigenproblem generated by a confined soft - core coulomb potential in @xmath14-dimensions , where @xmath41 as we have discussed above , for the cases we consider ,",
    "the spectrum of this problem is discrete , all eigenvalues are real and simple , and they can be arranged in an increasing sequence @xmath42 . the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] , we set up the schrdinger equation for the potential and discuss the correspondence second - order differential equation . in section [ method ] ,",
