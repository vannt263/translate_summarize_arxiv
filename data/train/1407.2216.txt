    "notably he used the third tool to construct relations between the generators . for the generic curve ( and modulo algebraic equivalence ) , he conjectured that they give all the relations ( see @xcite , introduction )",

    "the hidden background is the so - called motivic lefschetz decomposition , and the relations obtained this way are simply dictated by the motive of @xmath14 .",

    "theorem  [ thm : structure ] can then be reformulated as the existence of a surjective morphism of @xmath23-representations @xmath568 , which maps @xmath569 to @xmath455 and @xmath556 to @xmath79 .",
    "denote by @xmath570 the set of non - zero monomials in @xmath571 ( also without @xmath572 as a factor ) . for convenience we set @xmath573 .",
    "then consider the quotient @xmath574 the ring @xmath575 inherits a bigrading @xmath576 from @xmath554 .",
    "the operators @xmath563 and @xmath564 induce operators on @xmath575 , which we denote by @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "again we obtain a representation @xmath577 .",
    "further , since @xmath578 , we formally define the fourier transform on @xmath575 by @xmath579    we also define the subring @xmath580 , graded by @xmath581 with @xmath582 .",
    "we  have @xmath583 figure  [ fig : relations ] illustrates the construction of @xmath584 : take monomials on the @xmath585-th column of the dutch house ( white blocks ) , and then apply @xmath586 times the operator @xmath587 to obtain relations between the generators ( black blocks ) .                    as a result ,",
    "if we write @xmath595 for the subset of monomials without @xmath596 as a factor , then we have @xmath597 the bold blocks in figure  [ fig : relations ] describe the lower bound of @xmath53 such that @xmath598 is non - empty .",
    "in numerical terms , we have @xmath599 and that @xmath600 means @xmath601 .",
    "hence @xmath602 for all @xmath603 .",
    "the second part is immediate after and the fact that @xmath602 for all @xmath603 .",
    "for the first part , the goal is to relate all @xmath607 with @xmath601 to the elements @xmath604 and @xmath556 , and the idea is to use specific monomials to get these relations .",
    "we proceed by induction .",
    "suppose all @xmath608 can be expressed in terms of the elements @xmath604 and @xmath556 .",
    "then consider the monomial @xmath599 . applying @xmath609-times the operator  @xmath587",
    "we get @xmath610 , which vanishes in @xmath584 . on the other hand , by going through the definition of @xmath587 we find @xmath611 where @xmath511 is a polynomial in @xmath612 and @xmath556 .",
    "it remains to show that @xmath613 is non - zero .",
    "the observation is the following : when we apply the operator @xmath587 , the minus sign occurs every time two factors ( @xmath614 ) are merged into one ( @xmath615 ) . if we start from @xmath616 and arrive at @xmath607 , no matter how we proceed we have to do the merging @xmath617-times .",
    "this means all non - zero summands of @xmath613 are of the form @xmath618 times a positive number , hence negative .",
    "then the sum @xmath613 is also negative .",
    "meanwhile , based on an algorithm developed by liu and xu @xcite , bergvall computed the intersection numbers in @xmath34 for many values of @xmath1 ( see @xcite , section  4.2 ) .",
    "it then gives the dimensions of the gorenstein quotient @xmath620 , which is the quotient of @xmath34 by those classes that pair zero with all opposite degree classes .",
    "note that this computation is formal and does not involve actual relations in @xmath34 .",
    "there are surjective maps @xmath621 .",
    "our computation shows that for @xmath35 , the dimensions of @xmath584 and @xmath620 are equal , which means we have @xmath622 .",
    "in particular , we can confirm the following ( for @xmath623 this has been obtained independently by bergvall ; see @xcite , section  4.4 ) .",
    "however , the computer output is negative for @xmath44 and some greater values of @xmath1 .",
    "there the dimensions of @xmath584 are simply not symmetric .",
    "again by comparing with the dimensions of @xmath620 , we know exactly how many relations are missing .",
    "the numbers are listed in table  [ tab : missing ] below .",
    "note that for @xmath624 , we only calculated a range near the middle degree , presuming that @xmath34 behaves well near the top .",
    "we include a brief discussion about @xmath5 .",
    "recall that @xmath5 is the @xmath6-subalgebra of @xmath7 generated by  @xmath8 .",
    "faber s original conjecture predicts that @xmath5 is gorenstein with socle in degree  @xmath9 ( @xcite , conjecture  1 ) .",
    "together with , the identity above allows us to push relations in @xmath34 forward to @xmath5 .",
    "we used another computer program to do the work .",
    "then we recover the well - known result of faber and zagier , that @xmath5 is gorenstein for @xmath36 .",
    "note that when @xmath629 , the missing relations in @xmath34 do not affect the gorenstein property for @xmath5 .    from @xmath10 on , the computer output is again negative",
    "; see table  [ tab : missing ] .",
    "our computation for @xmath630 suggests that we obtain exactly the same set of relations as the faber - zagier relations ( see @xcite , section  0.2 ) . notably in the crucial case of @xmath10",
    ", we have not found the missing relation in codimension  @xmath631 .",
    "it is not known whether in theory we obtain the same relations .",
    "we continue to study the gorenstein properties for @xmath31})$ ] .",
    "a key step is to establish a similar property for the jacobian side .",
    "denote by @xmath24 the universal jacobian over @xmath13 .",
    "the tautological ring @xmath25 is thus defined .          the surjective map @xmath635 induces @xmath636 which , by  , restricts to an injective map @xmath637",
    ". then it follows from that @xmath632 for @xmath633 , and that @xmath638 is at most @xmath59-dimensional ..            the dutch house gives an nice interpretation . in figure",
    "[ fig : pairjac ] , the socle component is located precisely in the upper right corner . assuming the gorenstein property , one would expect a rotational symmetry about the center of the picture . together with the reflection symmetry about the middle vertical line ( given by the fourier transform ) , it would then imply a mysterious reflection symmetry about the middle horizontal line .",
    "in particular , one should have @xmath645 for @xmath232 , and using the grading in , a one - to - one correspondence between @xmath646 and @xmath647 .",
    " once again with the help of li ma , we computed the ring  @xmath575 defined in and its pairings .",
    "the computer output shows that for @xmath37 , we do have @xmath648 and perfect pairings between @xmath649 and @xmath650 .",
    "then since the surjective map @xmath651 is an isomorphism at the socle level , it is in fact an isomorphism .",
    "in particular , we can confirm the following .",
    "first assume @xmath367 .",
    "recall that @xmath28}$ ] is a @xmath652-bundle over @xmath24 .",

    "moreover , the blocks on the diagonal correspond exactly to the case @xmath661 , the pairing @xmath662 which in turn corresponds to the pairing @xmath663 in total , saying that is perfect for all @xmath113 , is equivalent to saying that is perfect for all @xmath642 .",
    "this settles the proof for ( some or all ) @xmath367 .    for the remaining @xmath29",

    "the proof is thus completed .          finally , we conclude by proposing an alternative description of the tautological rings .",
