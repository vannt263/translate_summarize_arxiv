    "understanding quantum decoherence is a fundamental subject of interest in modern physics . in this work",
    ", we theoretically study the issue of quantum decoherence for the problem of one localized electron spin in a solid state nuclear spin environment , where the electron spin eventually loses its quantum phase memory ( i.e. , dephases ) due to its interaction with the surrounding nuclear spin bath .",
    "this is often called `` central spin '' decoherence in a spin bath , with the localized electron spin being the central spin and the surrounding nuclear spin environment being the spin bath .",
    "this particular problem is important in the context of quantum information processing and quantum computation using localized electron spins as qubits , and as such , we concentrate on a few systems of interest in solid state quantum computation architectures , namely , si : p donor electron spin qubits and gaas and inas quantum dot electron spin qubits , all of which have considerable recent experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite interest .",
    "the theory we develop is , however , applicable to the general situation of the quantum dephasing of a single localized electron spin in solids due to the environmental influence of the slowly fluctuating nuclear spin bath consisting of many millions of surrounding nuclear spins mutually flip - flopping due to their magnetic dipolar coupling .",
    "the issue of specific interest in this paper , as the title of this paper suggests , is how the detailed form of the confinement for the localized electron in the solid ( e.g. , the exponentially confined hydrogenic confinement for the localized p donor electron state in si or the gaussian - type simple harmonic oscillator confinement for the localized electron in the gaas / inas quantum dot ) could have qualitative influence on its nuclear induced spin dephasing .",
    "this subtle ( but potentially significant ) dependence of electron spin dephasing on the nature of the electron localization has recently been emphasized in the discovery@xcite that a particular type of dynamical decoupling ( dd ) sequence@xcite can be ideal in restoring quantum coherence in the gaas quantum dot system , but not particularly effective in the si : p system , which can be traced back to the gaussian versus the exponential wavefunction localization in the two systems , leading to the validity or the lack thereof of a particular time perturbation expansion as discussed in depth in this work .",
    "thus , a detailed investigation of the effect of the localized electron wavefunction on the nuclear induced electron spin dephasing problem is both important and timely in view of the intense current activity in fault - tolerant quantum computation using spin qubits in semiconductors .",
    "it is important in the context of studying electron spin decoherence to distinguish among three different spin relaxation or decoherence times , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , which are discussed in the literature .",
    "( we should mention right at the outset that our work is focused entirely on @xmath2 , sometimes also denoted @xmath3 or spin memory time .",
    "@xmath2 is variously called spin decoherence time , spin dephasing time , transverse spin relaxation time , spin - spin relaxation time , and spin memory time in the literature . ) the spin relaxation time @xmath0 , also often called the longitudinal spin relaxation time or the energy relaxation time , is connected with the spin flip process which , in the presence of an externally applied magnetic field ( the case of interest to us in this work ) , necessarily requires phonons ( and spin - orbit coupling ) to carry away the electron spin zeeman energy , which is 3 orders of magnitude larger than the nuclear spin zeeman energy .",
    "this @xmath0-relaxation process can be made arbitrarily long by lowering the lattice temperature so that phonons are simply not available to provide the energy conservation . at the low ( @xmath4 or lower ) temperatures of interest to us in the quantum computing context",
    ", the relevant @xmath0 times are very long ( @xmath5 ) and are unimportant for our consideration .",
    "the @xmath1 time is the relevant decoherence time in the presence of substantial inhomogeneous broadening as , for example , in ensemble measurements over many electron spin qubits with varying ( i.e. , inhomogeneous ) nuclear spin environments . in the context of single spin qubits ,",
    "i.e. involving a single electron spin , the @xmath1 decoherence sets in due to the requisite time averaging which , due to ergodicity , becomes equivalent to the spatial inhomogeneity of the varying nuclear spin environments of many electron spins .",
    "thus , @xmath1 is measured either in a measurement over an ensemble of localized spins with the associated spatial averaging or in a time - averaged measurement for a single spin over many runs . a spin echo ( or hahn spin echo ) measurement",
    "gets rid of the inhomogeneous broadening and characterizes @xmath2 , the pure dephasing time of a single spin ( typically for the systems of our interest @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) , which is what we theoretically study in this work .",
    "a closely related , but by no means identical , definition of @xmath2 comes from considering the free induction decay ( fid ) of a single spin in a single - shot measurement without involving either spatial averaging over many spin qubits or temporal averaging over many runs .",
    "alternatively , fid is observed in a homogeneous ensemble .",
    "we will call such a fid dephasing time @xmath8 to distinguish it from the spin echo dephasing time @xmath2 .",
    "the above discussion of @xmath0 , @xmath9 , @xmath2 , and @xmath10 illustrates the considerable semantic danger of discussing `` spin decoherence '' because , depending on the context , the `` spin decoherence time '' for the same system could vary by many orders of magnitude ( i.e. , @xmath11 , etc . ) .",
    "to avoid such confusion , we emphasize that , in our opinion , the only sensible way of discussing spin decoherence is by considering specific experimental contexts . our definition of @xmath2 is thus the decoherence time measured in a hahn spin echo experiment . the only license we take with our definition of @xmath2 is that we continue using @xmath2 as the notation for spin decoherenc time even in situations where the spin coherence has been extended far beyond the hahn spin echo time by using multiple pulse sequences [ carr - purcell - meiboom - gill ( cpmg ) , concatenated dynamical decoupling ( cdd ) , etc . ]",
    "much more complex than the single @xmath12-pulse hahn sequence . for us , therefore , @xmath2 is the spin decoherence time as measured in an echo - type pulse sequence measurement , which could be a simple @xmath12-pulse spin echo or more complex pulse sequences meant to prolong spin memory beyond the spin echo refocusing .    finally , we point out an additional important complication , often erroneously neglected in the literature , associated with discussing spin decoherence in terms of a single decoherence time parameter , @xmath13 ( e.g. , @xmath0 or @xmath2 or @xmath9 or @xmath10 , etc . ) . such a description assumes , by definition , that the quantum memory ( i.e. , some precisely defined quantum amplitude or probability ) falls off in a simple exponential manner with time , i.e. , @xmath14 or @xmath15^n)}$ ] , where @xmath16 is a constant , so that a single decoherence time @xmath13 can completely parametrize the nature of decoherence .",
    "this is , however , not always the case , and the detailed functional dependence of quantum coherence on time almost always changes with @xmath17 in a complex manner , ruling out any simple single - parameter characterization of spin decoherence . to be consistent with the standard literature , we often discuss or describe our results by a single @xmath2 , but we simply define @xmath2 as the time it takes for the quantum memory to decay by a factor of @xmath18 ( or the extrapolated time at which an approximate exponential decay form will reach @xmath19 ) .",
    "this way we are not assuming any particular functional form of the quantum memory versus time decay . to be explicit , our results clearly indicate the decay of the spin probability density over time .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section  [ secspecdiff ] introduces the concept of spectral diffusion , which is the only spin dephasing mechanism considered in this work ( we believe it to be the most important spin decoherence mechanism for solid state quantum information processing using electron spins ) . sections  [ secinteractions ] , [ secdeocherence ] , and [ secdd ] formally define the problem in terms of the hamiltonian , the decoherence measure , and pulse sequences , respectively . in sec .",
    "[ secclusterexpansion ] , we review our cluster expansion method@xcite for solving this problem .",
    "section  [ shorttimeandwavefunction ] introduces the role of confinement or wavefunction by considering the initial time ( `` short time '' ) decay of spin coherence and then providing the detailed theoretical considerations associated with the functional form of the localized wavefunction as relevant for spin dephasing ; section  [ subseccontinuum ] contains a particularly important continuum approximation , which provides convenient formulas that yield estimated @xmath2 times as a function of the wavefunction size and shape . in sec .",

    "si has a net nuclear spin , which may contribute to spectral diffusion by flip - flopping with nearby @xmath20si .",
    "natural si contains about @xmath21 @xmath20si or less through isotopic purification .",
    "isotopic purification or nuclear polarization will suppress spectral diffusion in si .",
    "[ sd_schematic ] , width=336 ]    the spin decoherence mechanism known as spectral diffusion ( sd ) has a long history@xcite , and has been extensively studied recently@xcite in the context of spin qubit decoherence .",
    "consider a localized electron in a solid .",
    "this is our central spin .",
    "the electron spin could decohere through a number of mechanisms .",
    "in particular , spin relaxation would occur via phonon or impurity scattering in the presence of spin - orbit coupling , but these relaxation processes are strongly suppressed in localized systems and can be arbitrarily reduced by lowering the temperature and applying a strong external magnetic field , creating a large electronic zeeman splitting . in the dilute doping regime of interest in quantum computation , where the localized electron spins are spatially well separated ,",
    "a direct magnetic dipolar interaction between the electrons themselves is not an important dephasing mechanism.@xcite therefore , the interaction between the electron spin and the nuclear spin bath is the important decoherence mechanism at low temperatures and for localized electron spins .",
    "now we restrict ourselves to a situation in the presence of an external magnetic field ( which is the situation of interest to us ) and consider the spin decoherence channels for the localized electron spin interacting with the lattice nuclear spin bath . since the gyromagnetic ratios ( and , hence , the zeeman energies ) for the electron spin and the nuclear spins are typically a factor of 2000 different ( the electron zeeman energy being larger ) , hyperfine - induced direct spin - flip transitions between electron and nuclear spins would be impossible ( except as virtual transitions as will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ secinteractions ] ) at low temperature since phonons would be required for energy conservation .",
    "this leaves the indirect sd mechanism as the most effective electron spin decoherence mechanism at low temperatures and finite magnetic fields .",
    "the sd process is associated with the dephasing of the electron spin resonance due to the temporally fluctuating nuclear magnetic field at the localized electron site .",
    "these temporal fluctuations cause the electron spin resonance frequency to diffuse in the frequency space , hence the name spectral diffusion .",
    "these fluctuations result from the dynamics of the nuclear spin bath due to dipolar interactions with each other along with their hyperfine interactions with the qubit .",
    "this scenario is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ sd_schematic ] .",
    "nuclear spins in the spin bath flip - flop due to their mutual dipolar coupling ( since the typical experimental temperature scale @xmath22 is essentially an infinite temperature scale for the nuclear spins with nano - kelvin scale coupling ) , and this leads to a temporally random magnetic - field fluctuation on the central spin , i.e. , the electron .      in the most general form , the sd hamiltonian for the central spin decoherence problem may be written ( in @xmath23 unit ) @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are vectors of spin operators for the electron ( central spin ) and nucleus @xmath16 respectively , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are their respective zeeman energies ( with an external magnetic field applied in the @xmath29 direction ) , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are tensors describing electronuclear and internuclear interactions respectively .",

    "these zeeman energies are given by @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the applied magnetic - field strength , and @xmath45 and @xmath46 are gyromagnetic ratios of the electron and nucleus @xmath16 , respectively ( with @xmath46 defined in an opposite sense as @xmath45 ) .",

    "when we reintroduce @xmath31 , however , decoherence still occurs and is well defined in the @xmath50 limit because the electron spin will dephase as a result of nuclear field fluctuations induced by inter - nuclear interactions .",

    "the main consideration of this paper is the decoherence that may not be removed by simply increasing the magnetic - field strength and is applicable in the limit of a large applied field at the point where decoherence is insensitive to the strength of the applied field .",
    "we characterize decoherence as the expectation value of the electron spin over the evolution of the experiment .",
    "since we consider a dephasing - only hamiltonian of the form @xmath81 , we need only deal with dephasing decoherence . dephasing decoherence involves only the transverse component of the electron spin . for a given experiment",

    "are justifiably treated as infinite with respect to the @xmath104 scale intrabath interactions .",
    "the remaining zeeman and fermi - contact hf interactions in our approximate hamiltonian quantize the nuclear spins in the @xmath29 direction ( involving only @xmath105 nuclear spin operators ) and , thus , we can approximate the initial bath density matrix as a mixed state composed of uncorrelated pure nuclear spin states in this basis so that @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the magnitude of the @xmath16th nuclear spin and @xmath108 represents the state of the @xmath16th nuclear spin with a @xmath29 projection of @xmath69 .",
    "the cluster approximation in sec .",
    "[ clusterapprox ] will make use of the assumption that the bath is initially uncorrelated ( at least , approximately ) .",
    "section [ shorttimeandwavefunction ] will use the @xmath29 quantization as a further convenience .      if we simply let the system freely evolve , the decay of the electron spin expectation value strongly depends on the type of averaging we perform over bath states .",
    "if we consider an ensemble of electron spins , each with its own bath , then we will see rapid electron spin dephasing simply due to the distribution of hf nuclear fields , @xmath109 .",
    "this is known as inhomogeneous broadening because it broadens the electron spin precessional frequency due to inhomogeneity of the effective magnetic field .",
    "this , however , is an artifact of the ensemble or our lack of knowledge of the effective nuclear field of a static bath and not true decoherence .",
    "if we consider a single electron spin with a known nuclear field , or a homogeneous ensemble which may be obtained through mode locking,@xcite for example , we arrive at a dynamical decoherence known as fid . in our dephasing model , fid can only arise from interactions among bath elements , such as local dipolar or nonlocal hf - mediated interactions .",
    "traditionally,@xcite nonhomogeneously broadened coherence is measured from hahn spin echoes .",
    "the hahn echo sequence simply involves a single @xmath12 rotation midway through the evolution such that @xmath110 , with @xmath111 .",

    "what remains is sd induced by a dynamical nuclear bath .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the effects of the hahn echo go beyond the elimination of inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "the hahn echo is also a dd sequence,@xcite in which the first order of the magnus expansion@xcite is removed by the fact that the time - averaged hamiltonian , proportional to @xmath114 , decouples the qubit from the bath .",
    "for this reason , the hahn echo does not have the same effect as homogeneous ( or single qubit ) free induction decay.@xcite in particular , the hahn echo removes the lowest - order effects of hf - mediated interactions.@xcite this is because hf - mediated interactions , having an @xmath88 factor [ eq .",
    "( [ hfm ] ) ] , belong to @xmath83 , and if we consider only hf - mediated intrabath interactions , then @xmath115 .    given a dd sequence , such as the hahn echo for a dephasing system , coherence over a given net amount of time",
    "may be increased through a rapid repetition of the basic sequence .",
    "this strategy , known as bang - bang in the quantum information community,@xcite gives coherence enhancement at the cost of more frequent applications of @xmath12 pulses .",
    "pulses must be applied more frequently because errors due to higher order terms of the magnus expansion pile up over the course of the sequence .",
    "a better strategy is to use recursion , rather than repetition , to generate concatenated sequences.@xcite such cdd , with the hahn echo as the base sequence , has been shown@xcite to be effective for the sd problem .",
    "in fact , with each concatenation , we demonstrated , in ref .",
    ", coherence enhancement with an _ increase _ in the time between pulses ( let alone , the net sequence time ) .    with @xmath116 levels of concatenation ,",
    "our cdd pulse sequence is recursively defined by @xcite @xmath117 , with @xmath118 .",
    "cdd with @xmath119 is simply free evolution . at @xmath120",
    ", we have @xmath121 , which is simply the hahn echo ( with an extra @xmath12 pulse at the end to bring the electron spin back to its original phase apart from the decoherence ) . with each concatenation , we do to the previous sequence what the hahn echo does to free evolution and , in this way , we obtain improved dd . this sequence may be simplified by noting that two @xmath12 pulses in sequence do nothing .",
    "thus , @xmath122 ( again , arrows indicate sequences ordered in time ) and the up and down evolution operators at level @xmath123 have the recursive form of@xcite @xmath124    recently , a series of dd sequences was discovered by uhrig@xcite to be optimal in the number of pulses for the spin - boson model .",

    "unlike cdd , uhrig dd ( udd ) requires only a linear ( rather than exponential ) overhead in the number of pulses for each order of coherence enhancement . furthermore , udd was shown@xcite to kill off successive orders in a time expansion in a completely model - independent manner .",
    "the udd sequence has a strong advantage over cdd in its linear versus exponential scaling of the number of pulses ; however , it is effective only when a time expansion is convergent , while cdd is also effective in the intrabath perturbation for sd ( this is important since @xmath127 ) .    in sec .",
    "[ shorttimeandwavefunction ] , we will discuss the wavefunction dependence in the short - time approximation .",
    "it would be natural to discuss this in the context of the udd series since udd is effective in this short - time limit .",
    "however , the methods of sec .  [ subseccontinuum ] work for the cdd series but , unfortunately , do not work for the udd series . in this work ,",
    "we therefore focus attention on fid and the cdd series . note , however , that the udd and cdd series are the same for levels zero ( fid ) , 1 ( hahn@xcite ) , and 2 ( cpmg@xcite ) .",

    "state preparation and final readout are performed by biasing the two electrons , with an applied voltage , into the same dot so that the singlet state , @xmath324 , has the lowest energy because of the pauli - exchange interaction.@xcite voltage control is also used to turn on an exchange interaction by allowing the wavefunction of the two electrons on different dots to overlap ; such control can be used to rotate the qubit.@xcite by using this control , one can apply @xmath12 pulses in order to perform a hahn echo sequence or any other dd sequence ( such as those discussed in sec .",

    "this is the justification for summing over only the relevant dot in eq .",

    "the cluster contributions in each dot will be identical ; then @xmath336 is simply the squared value of the echo for the problem of a single electron in just one of the dots .",
    "there should , thus , be no qualitative difference between the spectral diffusion of a single - spin qubit and this double - spin qubit ; a prediction of @xmath337}$ ] for a single - spin qubit will carry over to the double - spin qubit .",
    "although the reported hahn echo decay time @xmath2 of ref .   is compatible with our theory ( which disregards other decoherence mechanism ) as a limiting case , it is clear that the experimental echo decay does not match the @xmath338}$ ] form .",
    "the experimentalists seem to be observing a decoherence mechanism that we are not treating .",
    "they report that the @xmath2 time increases with an increase in magnetic field@xcite ; therefore , they must not be operating in the high field limit regime .",
    "our results may be viewed as yielding the best decoherence times achievable by increasing the applied magnetic field .",
    "to minimize the effects of decoherence due to a bath of nuclear spins , one strategy is to polarize the nuclei .",
    "when they are polarized , they can not flip - flop . this is particularly appealing in iii - v semiconductors , where all of the isotopes have nonzero spin .",
    "recent experiments have successfully achieved some degree of nuclear polarization in double quantum dot systems.@xcite this is accomplished by biasing to a point where there is an anticrossing between the single state and the @xmath339 triplet state ; the transition between these states requires a nuclear spin flip to conserve angular momentum . by cycling through this anticrossing , they are able to produce polarizations of a few percent ( producing effective nuclear fields of about @xmath340 in dots where full polarization would yield about @xmath341).@xcite    even with such modest polarization",
    ", there can be a significant impact on inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "it does this by effectively smoothing out the hyperfine field and , because of this smoothing , has been coined the zamboni effect by experimentalists.@xcite essentially , the process of dynamic nuclear polarization will most likely polarize those nuclei with the strongest coupling to the electron , those with the largest hyperfine coupling .",
    "these nuclei are also the most important in terms of inhomogeneous broadening ( they give the largest contribution to the effective magnetic field ) .",
    "strong polarization is not necessarily involved in the suppression of inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "homogenizing the system to remove the broadening need only change the polarization by roughly the same amount as the unbiased statistical broadening , which scales as @xmath342 ; this is less than @xmath343 for @xmath344 . by removing the effects of inhomogeneous broadening in this way",
    ", it may be possible to view fid due to sd .",
    "this modest polarization will have a weak effect on sd according to our theory . while @xmath9 ( from inhomogeneous broadening ) is improved by this strategy , @xmath2 ( from spectral diffusion ) is not significantly altered .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "first , the nuclei being polarized are not necessarily those nuclei responsible for sd .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figgaussianwf ] where the regions of electron occupation probability do not correspond to the greatest sd contributors .",
    "second , sd has a weak dependence on polarization because its contributors are clusters of two or more nuclei . where we quantify polarization as @xmath345 ( the difference of the probability of being up versus down assuming spin @xmath86 nuclei ) , the number of pairs that can flip - flop scales as @xmath346.@xcite when",
    "the spin is larger than @xmath86 , the dependence is even weaker ( there is a larger fraction of states of two nuclei that can flip - flop ) .",
    "therefore , one needs nearly @xmath280 polarization in order to suppress sd @xmath2 decay .",
    "therefore , we predict , with substantial confidence , that the coherence enhancement by the zamboni effect could at best lead to a decoherence time of @xmath347 , but never up to @xmath348 , i.e. , the zamboni effect would never produce a coherence time longer than the spin echo coherence time .",

    "the generalized concatenated echo decoherence times are @xmath353 . an interesting experimental test of this theory could be to compare the decoherence times of the same sample with an applied magnetic field in different lattice directions and check for agreement with table  [ gaasinas_mu ] ( for gaas or inas ) ; in such a test , however , one must carefully account for any change in confinement as a result of changes in the applied magnetic field . for experimental systems that allow for the application of pulse sequences , with the ability to perform rapid @xmath12 rotations of the electron spin relative to dynamical time scales",

    "failure of the short - time approximation does not invalidate our general cluster expansion [ sec .  [ clusterapprox ] and ref .",
