    "triangular flow , as well as higher flow harmonics , should arise due to initial state fluctuations in a collision geometry .",
    "then , experiments at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) provided us with a new set of amazing results .",
    "particularly , the ridge structure in a two - dimensional correlation function was also observed in proton - lead @xcite and in high multiplicity proton - proton collisions @xcite .",
    "the origin of the ridge - like structure in @xmath14 interactions and its similarity to that in pb+pb collisions are still open questions .",
    "triangular flow measured in @xmath15+pb reactions appeared to be compatible with @xmath2 in lead - lead collisions provided the multiplicity of secondary hadrons was the same .",
    "traditionally proton - nucleus collisions are considered as cold nuclear matter effects , hence , the question is , can the azimuthal anisotropy in cold nuclear matter have the the same strength as in hot nuclear matter ?    in heavy ion collisions the long - range , i.e. , @xmath16 , angular dihadron correlations at low and intermediate transverse momenta in ( mid)central collisions were shown to be described with the sum of the fourier harmonics @xmath17 , found from independent flow analysis @xcite .",

    "we employ the hydjet++ model @xcite , which merges parametrized hydrodynamics with jets .",
    "in addition to hard processes , the unique feature of the model is the possibility to switch on and off the elliptic and triangular harmonics in order to investigate both their individual contributions and the result of mutual interplay to the considered phenomena .",

    "the two - particle correlation function is defined as the ratio of pair distribution in the same event ( signal ) to the combinatorial pair distribution ( background ) , where pairs are not correlated . in experiment",

    "although remnants of it can be seen over a broad @xmath36 range at the away - side , no long - range azimuthal correlations are seen at the near - side .",
    "the long - range azimuthal correlations start to appear at the near - side in the presence of elliptic flow with the characteristic @xmath63 pattern .",
    "they are flat in relative pseudorapidity up to @xmath64 , which corresponds to a flat pseudorapidity shape of the collective flow in the model .",
    "finally , triangular flow enhances these near - side correlations , often referred to as a ridge .",
