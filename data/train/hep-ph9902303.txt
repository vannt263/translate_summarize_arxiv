    "the charged higgs bosons @xmath1 are a central ingredient of the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) which is not only an attractive alternative to the  single higgs doublet but is also inherent in the supersymmetric models , notably  ( ) . within the framework of , recent experimental analyses @xcite point to the heavy ( @xmath7 ) mass region , where they can not be produced in top quark decay , and their dominant decay @xmath8 suffers from large  background .    in @xcite",
    "the author has shown that the @xmath0 decay mode of the heavy charged higgs bosons @xmath1 offers a striking signature of high @xmath9 tau and large missing energy through which @xmath1 can be discovered readily at lhc , provided that the top quark momentum in the dominant production process @xmath6 is constrained .",
    "although the signal cross section falls markedly at large @xmath10 and small @xmath2 , it was claimed that for @xmath11 and @xmath12 tev the signal is sizeable enough after selection cuts to compete with the irreducible background and the finite lhc luminosity .",
    "given now that heavy @xmath1 can be discovered in the @xmath0 decay mode for much of the parameter space , and that @xmath10 and @xmath2 can be measured to certain extent using the tau and missing transverse momenta distributions and the total cross section , it is desirable to be able to narrow down the parameters further by utilising the dominant decay mode @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath3 decay mode of @xmath1 , following production from the parton level process @xmath6 , has been studied extensively in the literature @xcite from the viewpoint of the search for heavy @xmath1 .",
    "the utility of the @xmath3 decay mode is limited for this purpose because of the contamination from  background . however , given that @xmath10 and @xmath2 can be measured in the @xmath0 decay mode , this can be used to constrain the final state .    in this paper",
    "we study the effect of top quark polarisation from @xmath1 decay on parton level observables , noting that the top quark is polarised by the chiral coupling of @xmath1 to @xmath3 , for either large or small @xmath2 .",
    "to be more precise , the two chiral components of the @xmath1 coupling to @xmath3 are proportional to @xmath13 and @xmath14 and the two balance out when @xmath15 ( @xmath16 gev ) . far away from this central value , @xmath17 or @xmath18 ,",
    "the couplings are dominantly left or right leading to characteristic correlation patterns .",
    "our discussions are applicable to any class of production processes , but as an example for studying the effect of boosts on @xmath1 momenta we adopt the @xmath6 production process at lhc .",
    "when @xmath19 , the production cross section in the @xmath20 reaches the minimum , while the correlation pattern will resemble the background , and our analysis will not be of much use . if the background reduction is almost perfect before the polarisation analysis , the polarisation measurement can be used to measure @xmath2 accurately .",
    "this is presumably unlikely .",
    "the use of right - handed tau polarisation as a characteristic signal of @xmath1 decay was studied in @xcite .",
    "in addition , we note that if the tau is produced in the decay of the top quark through @xmath1 , the distribution of invariant mass squared  is flat since there is no momentum correlation between the @xmath21 from the decay of the top quark and the @xmath22 .",
    "this does not apply to the background from @xmath23 decay , and if we know the exact distribution , we can use it to measure the signal to background ratio and thus confirm the tau polarisation analysis .",
    "our current work is in a similar vein . as in @xcite , the technique is not expected to be of great use in reducing the background , but once an excess of signal over background is observed near @xmath1 mass",
    ", the momentum correlations resulting from top quark polarisations can be used as a check for the signal presence in the sample and its proportion to the background .",
    "we outline the analysis procedure for various decay signatures .",
    "finally , we note that a preliminary study of the top quark polarisation in @xmath1 decay was presented in @xcite .",
    "our present analysis is different in several ways .",
    "firstly , the primary purpose of @xcite is in measuring @xmath2 , rather than in distinguishing the signal from the background .",
    "thus their analysis is applicable in a range of @xmath2 complementary to the range emphasised here .",
    "secondly , the variable utilised in @xcite , namely the leptonic energy in the @xmath1 rest frame , is not well defined unless @xmath1 is produced at an @xmath24 collider and decays leptonically with no other source of missing energy . in any case , for the intermediate region of @xmath2 the production rate at hadronic colliders is small .",
    "we adopt @xmath10 and @xmath2 as the two higgs sector parameters . when calculating the width of @xmath1 in order to simulate the finite width effect , we assume that the @xmath3 branching ratio is 100%",
    ". the top branching ratio to @xmath25 is also taken to be 100% , and @xmath23 branching ratio to a pair of fermions @xmath26 is divided into quarks and leptons by the tree level ratios of @xmath27 for each quark pair and @xmath28 for each lepton pair . note that unlike in reference @xcite , ` lepton ' , @xmath29 , always includes tau .",
    "we restrict our discussions to the tree level .",
    "the dominant part of the radiative corrections @xcite , which are known to be significant , can be absorbed in terms of the running mass of the bottom quark and therefore does not affect the shapes of our distributions .",
    "we simulate the jet showering by imposing cuts between parton directions for the case of the hadronic decay of the top quark .    for simplicity",
    "we take the top quark mass to be 175 gev for both yukawa coupling and the kinematics , and the bottom quark mass to be 4.25 gev , again for both yukawa coupling and the kinematics .",
    "the fermions from @xmath23 decay are considered massless .",
    "the electroweak parameters are @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 gev , @xmath33 gev .",

    " maskawa matrix element @xmath34 $ ] is taken to be 1 .",
    "the tree level matrix elements squared are simple and are calculated by hand .",
    "consistency checks are carried out between different limits .",
    "the numerical integrations are carried out using  @xcite and the total decay width , in the narrow width limit of the propagators , agrees with the width calculated by hand .",
    "the decay matrix element squared , corresponding to the feynman graph of figure [ decayfey ] , is given by : @xmath35 +    \\frac{2p_{\\bar b}\\cdot p_\\ell}{2p_t\\cdot p_\\ell}(g_t^2m_t^2-g_b^2p_t^2 )   \\right ] .",

    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 are breit - wigner propagators for the top quark and @xmath40 , respectively . in our analysis",
    "we also generate the @xmath1 mass with a breit - wigner distribution .",
    "this formula essentially carries all the information about momentum correlations .",
    "the effect of top quark polarisation is manifested in the second term in large square brackets which is proportional to @xmath41 .",
    "if the two chiral couplings were equal , the term vanishes in the limit of on - shell top quark .    in the limit of on - shell top",
    "quark and @xmath40 boson , the matrix element squared , and hence the differential decay rate , depend only on two independent dot products ( or invariant masses ) , which we can take to be @xmath42 and @xmath43 since these two quantities are measurable , as invariant masses , in the leptonic decay of the top quark , if bottom quark charge tagging is available .",
    "we have : @xmath44 and hence the above statement holds .",
    "furthermore , from equations ( [ fullmesq ] ) and ( [ dotproducts ] ) we see that in the limit of non - chiral coupling , the dependence on @xmath42 vanishes altogether , as would a general non - chiral background .",
    "hence the dependence of the differential decay rate on @xmath42 would be an indication of the presence of @xmath1 .",
    "this would not hold if the two coupling strengths were similar , @xmath45 .",
    "this implies @xmath46 .    in experimental analyses",
    ", a possible approach would be to fit the multi - dimensional differential decay distributions with theoretical expectations for signal and background .",
    "however , for our purposes , let us define the following dimensionless quantity in the limit of on - shell @xmath40 : @xmath47 from ( [ fullmesq ] ) , the differential distribution of @xmath48 translates directly to the chiral coupling strengths .",
    "@xmath49 is the normalisation which is a function of the masses .",
    "given that @xmath10 needs to be known approximately for our analysis to be of much use , we can define @xmath49 for instance as follows : @xmath50    the dependence on @xmath48 observed will be the sum of the signal and the background which , after the signal selection cuts , is compatible with @xmath1 production . if the background does not involve chiral interactions , the distribution is flat , and even when the background does involve chiral interactions , the distribution can be analysed as the linear combination of the signal and background expectations .",
    "one can compare the ratio thus obtained with the signal to background ratio observed in order to confirm the presence of @xmath1 signal .",
    "in the next chapter we study the exact definitions of @xmath48 for different final states .",
    "the simplest case is the leptonic decay of the top quark , with the charge tagging of both bottom jets and the lepton .",
    "this allows us to assign all momenta correctly .",
    "the size of the sample will be limited , since in addition to the leptonic branching ratio of the top quark , the rate is reduced further by the requirement of bottom quark charge tagging , the efficiency of which one might roughly estimate to be around @xmath51 .    in figure [",
    "figa]a we show the differential distribution of @xmath48 at @xmath52 gev . as stated in the previous chapter , the distribution is flat for @xmath53 , and rapidly approaches the large and small @xmath2 limits away from this central value .",
    "let us concentrate on the two representative extreme values @xmath54 and 30 , and the central value @xmath55 from here on .",
    "the finite energy resolution of detectors can lead to a finite spread in the invariant mass distribution @xcite .",
    "the binning in our distributions of @xmath56 are fairly broad , corresponding to roughly @xmath57 times the energy scale considered . for the quantity @xmath58 in the denominator of ( [ lambda ] ) , this corresponds to the energy spread of @xmath59 gev .",
    "this is similar to the resolution obtainable at lhc @xcite .    the dependence on @xmath10 is studied at @xmath54 and @xmath60 in figure [ figa]b .",
    "we see that the scale normalisation of ( [ lambdanorm ] ) is satisfactory , and there is little residual dependence on @xmath10 .",
    "once we drop the bottom quark charge tagging requirement , we need to consider a new definition of @xmath21 and @xmath61 in the procedure outlined above .",
    "it is possible that the signal selection procedure has already picked out one or the other of the two bottom jets as belonging to the decay of the top quark .",
    "if this is the case , the assignment is again trivial . from here on we assume that this is not the case .    if @xmath62 the procedure is straightforward , as @xmath63 and the top quark decay products point back - to - back , even when we consider the boost from the production process . in this case @xmath64 and @xmath65 is much greater than the other dot product .",
    "the author has verified that the distributions look identical to figure [ figa]a if we simply take @xmath43 to be the smaller of the two dot products .    for general @xmath10 , particularly when @xmath66 at @xmath67 gev , the two dot products have similar distributions . in this case",
    "the charge tagging discussed above is an effective strategy . here",
    "we proceed by summing over the two distributions corresponding to the ` right ' and ` wrong ' assignments of bottom quark jets .",
    "the resulting distributions are shown in figure [ figc ] for @xmath68 gev .",
    "this is already sufficiently below the contaminated region .",
    "note that the normalisation is to two . comparing with figure [ figa]a",
    "we see that the region @xmath69 is similar in two distributions , but figure [ figc ] has tails at @xmath70 where most of the wrong assignment lies .",
    "this result indicates that the mis - assignment of bottom quarks , for example from production processes , is unlikely to have significant effect on our analysis , because of the different kinematic limits on the invariant masses .",
    "we see that the flatness of the ` background ' @xmath71 case is retained here .",
    "if the top quark decays hadronically , the mass reconstruction allows one to assign @xmath21 and @xmath63 correctly to the two bottom quark jets .",
    "we assume that this has been done already in the signal selection process .",
    "we also assume that bottom quark jets are distinguishable from light quark jets . however , the @xmath29 and @xmath72 of equation ( [ fullmesq ] ) are now indistinguishable unless we tag the charges of light quark jets as well as the bottom quark jets .    here",
    "we choose to proceed by defining @xmath29 to be the jet which minimises @xmath73 .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ figd ] .",
    "the distribution is somewhat flatter than the distributions in the leptonic channel , figures [ figa ] and [ figc ] , reflecting the difficulty with which the light quark jets can be assigned to the parent quarks . @xmath52",
    "gev is adopted , but the distribution for different @xmath10 are found to be similar .    the problem of assigning the jets correctly can be seen in figure [ fige ] which compares the differential distributions in invariant masses  and .",
    "the distributions are roughly independent of either @xmath10 or @xmath2 .",
    "we see that the two dot products have similar profiles , and our procedure can not escape contamination from the wrong assignment .",
    "the above discussions for the hadronic decay assume that the parton directions are known from the jet distributions .",
    "in practice , the jets can overlap when either top quark decay products being produced from relatively light @xmath1 interfere with the @xmath63 jet , or when the top quark is boosted in heavy @xmath1 decay and the decay products are clustered near each other .",
    "these cases lead to ambiguous definitions of jet momenta .",
    "let us study the effect of jet showering by introducing cuts on jet separations .",
    "a typical azimuthal - pseudorapidity separation @xmath74 required to define jets and reduce the inter - jet interference might be taken to be 0.7 . in terms of the azimuthal angle at zero rapidity",
    "this corresponds to 0.7 radians , or 40 degrees .",
    "let us proceed by replacing @xmath75 by the angle between two jets in the rest frame of @xmath1 .",
    "we do not consider the effect of nonzero @xmath1 momenta .",
    "this is sensitive to the selection cuts imposed in order to reduce the background .",
    "the ratio of events passing the cuts is shown in figure [ figf ] .",
    "the suppression is severe at large @xmath10 where the production cross section also falls . from the events which do pass the separation cuts , it is difficult to extract correlation effects . at @xmath76 tev , for example",
    ", the effects vanish altogether .",
    "the distribution after cuts is shown in figures [ figg ] for @xmath68 gev and 500 gev , to be compared with figure [ fige ] before cuts .",
    "the normalisations are to unity before cuts .",
    "the effect of cuts is found to be significant , but not prohibitive in studying top quark polarisation .      in order to study the effect of boosts on @xmath1 momenta from the production process , we consider the production process @xmath6 .",
    "the distributions are expected to be modified slightly because of the boosts on @xmath1 momenta acquired from the production . for the calculation of the production process",
    "we proceed as in @xcite .    in figures [ figi ]",
    "we show distributions analogous to [ figg ] for the hadronic decay after cuts .",
    "the cuts are now in terms of @xmath75 in the collider frame rather than the angle between jets .",
    "the normalisation is to unity after cuts for each distribution .",
    "we see that the distributions are not significantly affected by the boost .",
    "the detector cuts on pseudorapidity , and any other separation cuts involving jets arising from the production process , for example the top quark in @xmath6 , can only affect the normalisation of the distribution .",
    "the separation cuts between the @xmath1 decay products are significant only because they directly affect the range of invariant masses accessible for our analysis .    for the sake of completeness",
    ", the author has run an analogous simulation for the leptonic top quark decay with the cuts @xmath77 between the bottom quark jets and @xmath78 between the lepton and the bottom quark jets .",
    "the effect has been found to be small , as expected .",
    "in this paper we studied the effect on top quark polarisation of the chiral charged higgs boson @xmath1 coupling to fermions .",
    "we discussed the optimum variables @xmath48 which can be adopted in both leptonic and hadronic decays of the top quark .",
    "the variable @xmath48 we adopted assumes that @xmath10 is already approximately known by the time we apply this analysis , either by the observation of a peak in invariant mass of @xmath79 , or by the analysis of @xmath1 decay to @xmath0 as mentioned in @xcite .    for the leptonic decay of the top quark",
    ", @xmath48 can be defined such that the distributions have the desired features of a clear momentum correlation effect and flat distributions for the background .",
    "charge tagging the bottom quark jets and the lepton helps when @xmath67 gev .",
    "the boost on @xmath1 from the production process is found to give only a small effect , in the case of @xmath6 production mode .",
    "we expect our analysis to be general to all production modes , at lhc and beyond .    in conclusion ,",
    "top quark polarisation is useful for confirming the presence of @xmath1 in a sample of final states containing @xmath79 in experimental analyses of near future , at @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and up to @xmath80 in both hadronic and leptonic channels ."
