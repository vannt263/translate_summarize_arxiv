    "what we are interested in , however , is the transmission of a single isolated nanocontact ; we should therefore try to attain the limit of an infinitely large supercell .",
    "one could approach this limit in many different ways , for example by calculating transmission at some @xmath39 ( e.g. , at the @xmath40 point , @xmath41 ) or else by integrating the transmission over the 2d bz as in eq .  1 .",

    "as we shall show , at each @xmath39 there is a clear correlation between sharp features in the transmission as a function of energy and the electronic structure of the supercell .",
    "let us consider in particular the dispersion of states with @xmath12 .",
    "if the nanocontact were cut , all the states would be @xmath11-localized inside the lead block , forming a dense set of states that are flat in @xmath12 , totally devoid of dispersion . when the nanocontact is established , a majority of these states remain still localized inside the lead , but a few extended states appear , characterized by @xmath12 dispersion .",
    "these extended states are not necessarily easy to identify , because as a function of @xmath12 they ( anti-)cross the dense lead localized states .",

    "we classify the electron states in terms of the orbital angular momentum @xmath45 around the nanowire axis .",
    "though in our geometry the @xmath45 is not strictly a good quantum number due to the presence of the leads , all the electron states at the @xmath44 point ( as well as at the @xmath40 point ) can be separated into three groups which we call as @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "we do this separation as follows . at the @xmath44 point ( and at the @xmath40 point ) , electron states are classified according to irreducible representations of the group @xmath49 .",

    "note that there will be in principle smaller contributions from higher atomic states such as @xmath59 , @xmath60 , but that is not very important .",
    "similarly , in a transmission calculation each transmission eigenchannel ( obtained by diagonalizing the hermitian matrix @xmath61 , @xmath62 being the transmission matrix@xcite ) is clearly associated with a well defined @xmath63 so that the total transmission is naturally decomposed onto contributions from @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",

    "moreover , the states of @xmath46 symmetry are marked by circles when their squared wave - functions have a charge on the nanowire larger than 4% .",
    "the amount of charge for these states on both the first contact atom and the nanowire middle atom ( central atom ) is given by the height of vertical lines on the ldos panels .",
    "in ni all spin up @xmath4 states are occupied so that the corresponding bands of @xmath47 and @xmath48 symmetry lie well below the fermi energy .",
    "they are clearly visible in fig  [ bandsup ] as the crowd of localized states amassed below energy @xmath64 ev .",
    "these states should not participate to electron transport and we do not display in fig .",
    "[ bandsup ] the data for @xmath47 and @xmath48 . around the fermi energy",

    "they give rise to a dispersive band as shown in fig .",
    "[ bandsup ] .",
    "accordingly , the transmission of the @xmath46 channel is a smooth function of energy and is close to 1 , because the @xmath3 band is broad , and with its high kinetic energy it is very poorly reflected at the nanocontact .",
    "below @xmath66 ev , however , the @xmath65 states hybridize strongly with @xmath67 states , making their effective dispersion much flatter , or the effective mass along @xmath11 much bigger . as a result , in this energy region well below @xmath43 the @xmath63=0 transmission drops well below 1 , developing a strong energy dependence .",

    "[ bandsdown ] ) . here",

    "we mark the states by circles if their charge on the nanowire is larger than 4% ( for @xmath47 ) and 16% ( for @xmath48 ) . for the @xmath46 channel ,",
    "the dispersive @xmath65 band ends well above @xmath43 at an energy about @xmath68 ev .",
    "the fermi energy falls inside the energy region of strong @xmath69 hybridization .",
    "here , for all @xmath63 , the electron bands are quite narrow which leads to significant energy variations of the corresponding transmission function . as anticipated",
    "there is a clear correlation between sharp features in the transmission as a function of energy and the presence of extended states .",
    "for example , the maximum in the transmission for the @xmath46 channel just below the fermi energy corresponds to a slightly dispersive band with mainly @xmath67 character .",
    "similarly , the maxima in the @xmath47 transmission at about @xmath70 , @xmath64 , @xmath71 , and @xmath68 ev agree with the extended bands seen at those energies .    it should be emphasized , however , that there are some aspects in the transmission function which can not be understood solely from the band structure analysis . for instance , the energy band of @xmath46 symmetry has a small gap at an energy around @xmath72 ev ( majority spin ) or @xmath73 ev ( minority spin ) where the transmission function remains continuous and does not drop to zero .",
    "this is because the transmission function is really calculated for an infinite lead - nanocontact - lead open system ( and should be in principle compared with the ldos constructed via scattering states ) , whereas the ldos shown refers to the nanocontact alone , closed onto itself via periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath11 direction .",
    "the two will approach one another only when increasing conceptually the number of bulk planes included in the supercell to infinity .",
    "the energy bands will then continuously change so that the band gap discussed above ( which is an artifact of the periodic boundary condition along the @xmath11 axis ) will eventually disappear .",
    "we actually tested these conclusions using a simple tight - binding model .",
    "note that the only quantity obtained from supercell calculations and needed for evaluation of transmission function is the self - consistent potential which turns out to converge much better ( than the ldos ) with the length of the supercell .",
    "one feature which is important to underline again with regard to the @xmath46 minority spin channel is that its transmission at @xmath43 is well below 1 , despite a massive presence of @xmath3 states .",
    "this is clearly the result of a geometry - induced hybridization of @xmath65 states  by themselves highly conductive with the poorly conductive @xmath67 states .",
    "we expect this hybridization to be in fact more general than the assumed 3-atom nanowire geometry , and the @xmath3-channel transmission reduction to carry over to all cases where hybridization is allowed by symmetry .",
    "this observation will be useful later .",
    "spin - dependent transmission function of the ni nanowire in the fully relaxed configuration ( upper panel ) .",
    "the lower panels display the symmetry decomposition of the transmission function and of the ldos at the mid - nanowire atom . , width=321 ]    we now present the ( @xmath39-integrated ) transmission function of the 3-atom suspended ni nanowire in the relaxed configuration ( fig .  [ trelax ] ) . on the upper panel",
    "we show the total transmission for the majority ( up ) and minority ( down ) spin channels . to understand better",
    "the different features in the transmission curves we separate on the lower panels the total transmission onto contributions from different @xmath63 and also show the ldos at the middle nanowire atom of the corresponding symmetry . at arbitrary @xmath39 ( unlike the @xmath44 or the @xmath40 point )",
    ", the transmission eigenchannels are not associated to a certain @xmath63 but have , in general , contributions from all the @xmath63 .",
    "therefore we decompose the total transmission as follows . for each @xmath39 and for each transmission eigenchannel @xmath74 the charge inside a sphere of some radius @xmath75 ( volume @xmath76 ) surrounding the middle nanowire atom is calculated as @xmath77 .",
    "it can be further decomposed onto contributions from different @xmath78 ( in our calculations @xmath79 , 1 , and 2 ) : @xmath80 , where @xmath81 and the projections @xmath82 are obtained from @xmath83 .",
    "the transmission of each eigenchannel is then weighted by its charge of a certain symmetry .",
    "for example , the contribution of the @xmath74-th channel to the transmission of @xmath46 symmetry is given by @xmath84 .",
    "the contributions from different @xmath39 and from different eigenchannels are then properly added to produce the final value .",
    "we first discuss the transmission function for the majority spin channel ( spin up ) . here , the transmission around the fermi energy is almost 1 and it is due to nearly free propagation of the @xmath65 state ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "since the spin up @xmath4 states of the wire are occupied , the @xmath47 and the @xmath48 channels contribute to the total transmission only at energies lower than @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , at @xmath43 the @xmath47 channel gives rise only to a small tunneling current while the @xmath48 channel is completely closed .",
    "for the minority spin channel ( spin down ) , the transmission curves are qualitatively similar to majority spin channel but are shifted to higher energies due to the exchange gap , which in the ni nanowire is @xmath1 1.25 ev . at the fermi energy there are now down spin @xmath4 states available for transport .",
    "the transmission of the @xmath46 channel at the fermi energy is still close to 1 but shows a strong energy dependence and corresponds to a mainly @xmath67 ldos peak at the central nanowire atom .",
    "the transmission function for the @xmath47 channel shows two broad maxima around @xmath70 ev and @xmath68 ev .",
    "they are associated with two double degenerate @xmath85 states of the three atom ni wire .",
    "a third state is located at lower energy ( about @xmath86 ev ) and is not shown in fig .",
    ". these three states will develop  upon increasing the nanowire length  into a twofold degenerate band with bandwidth about 3 ev .",
    "we find that the fermi energy is located between two states of higher energy and the @xmath47 channel contributes here about 0.7 to the total transmission .",
    "the remaining @xmath48 channel corresponds to a very narrow twofold degenerate @xmath87 band of an infinite wire ( the bandwidth is about 0.6 ev ) .",
    "this band , however , crosses the fermi energy .",
    "therefore , right below the fermi energy one has a noticeable contribution from the @xmath48 channel to the total transmission while its transmission at the @xmath43 is about 0.5 .",
    "this channel is responsible for a transmission peak at the energy @xmath71 ev .     the same as in fig .",
    "[ trelax ] but for the ni nanowire in unrelaxed configuration .",
    ", width=321 ]    we can further investigate how the structural relaxation affects electron transport . in fig .",
    "[ tunrelax ] we present the transmission function of the ni nanowire in the unrelaxed initial configuration .",
    "similarly to the relaxed configuration ( fig .",
    "[ trelax ] ) , we also report the symmetry - decomposed transmission as well as the ldos at the nanowire central atom .",
    "one can see that the main conclusions drawn for the relaxed configuration remain unchanged .",
    "the majority spin transmission at the fermi energy is about 0.8 and is again dominated by the @xmath3-like channel . separating the minority spin transmission at the fermi energy , one obtains values of 1.0 , 0.7 , and 0.2 from @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 channels , respectively . due to larger wire - lead separation in the unrelaxed configuration ( parameter @xmath14 in table .  1 )",
    ", the nanowire states are less coupled to the leads . as a result",
    ", the peaks in transmission curves get sharper ( see , e.g. , two peaks for the @xmath47 channel and the peak for the @xmath48 channel ) .",
    "this leads to the smaller transmission at the fermi energy for the @xmath48 channel  0.2 versus 0.5 in the relaxed configuration ( see fig .  [ trelax ] ) . for the @xmath47 channel , the longer interatomic bonds in the wire ( parameter @xmath4 in table .",
    "1 ) lead to the fact that the two maxima in the transmission are less separated in energy and move closer to the fermi level .",
    "this compensates the previous effect so that the transmission at the fermi energy for the @xmath47 channel does not practically change compared to the relaxed configuration .",
    "we can now translate all results into a calculated ballistic conductance . from the total transmission at the fermi energy we obtain a conductance @xmath88 and @xmath89 for relaxed and unrelaxed nanowires , respectively .",
    "the conductance for the relaxed configuration turns out to be larger with respect to the unrelaxed case which is reasonable because of smaller lead - nanowire separation ( better contact ) .",
    "the calculated conductances are in good agreement with break - junction measurements showing a quite broad first conductance peak centered at @xmath90@xcite or at @xmath91.@xcite the breadth of the measured conductance histogram peak can be explained by observing that the detailed nanocontact conductance depends noticeably on the detailed geometry of the lead - nanocontact structure , as was seen for example by comparison of the relaxed and unrelaxed three - atom geometries .",

    "they considered an unrelaxed nanowire ( which corresponds to our unrelaxed configuration ) and reported values close to @xmath92 for both majority and minority spin conductances . in comparison with our",
    "ni results that finding is somewhat puzzling , as we obtain a much higher minority spin conductance due to a sizable contribution from the @xmath4 electrons . in this respect ,",
    "our results are closer to recent conductance calculations performed by jacob _",
    "et al._@xcite they studied nanocontacts formed by two ni atoms joining the two ni electrodes and also found a non zero conductance from minority spin @xmath4 states at low nanocontact stretching .",
    "we should also stress that conductances reported here are much smaller than the ideal one for an infinite tipless monatomic wire @xmath93 , where in the absence of any reflection the conductance is just equal to the number of bands at the fermi energy which is 7 .",
    "the reduction from this ideal 3.5 conductance to the real 1.6 is due to the fact that @xmath4 electrons are reflected by about 75% , and also to @xmath94 hybridization . on the other hand , this limited transmission effect is not as drastic as the predicted effect of a magnetization reversal ( or `` domain wall '' ) built into an infinite nanowire.@xcite in the latter case all the @xmath4 channels are completely blocked at the fermi energy so that conductance of the nanowire was only @xmath95 due to two ( one per spin ) @xmath3-like channels .",
    "to summarize , we have presented dft calculations of the structural and magnetic properties of the three - atom ni nanowire suspended between two semi - infinite ni(001 ) leads .",
    "a scattering - based approach was applied to study ballistic transport in both unrelaxed and relaxed configurations of the nanowire .",
    "our calculations show that in both atomic configurations the majority spin conductance is attributed to one @xmath3-like channel and is , therefore , very close to @xmath92 . on the contrary , the minority spin conductance has also noticeable contribution from the @xmath4 states and is higher  @xmath96 and @xmath90 for unrelaxed and relaxed configurations , respectively .",
    "we found that overall conductances are quite close to recent experimental break junction results .",
    "moreover , the fact that conductance is sensitive to the details of underlying atomic structure could account for a quite broad first peak in conductance histograms observed in experiment .",

    "the amount of contraction depends on the specific second layer atom since not all atoms here are equivalent ( unlike the surface plane atoms ) .",
    "for example , the second layer atom beneath the nanowire end atom moves noticeably outwards by about 0.05   , or 2.8% @xmath22 relative to the surface plane .",
    "two other ( mutually equivalent ) atoms of the second layer located on the sides of the square @xmath10 supercell move outwards by only about 1.6% @xmath22 while the fourth second layer atom ( located on the diagonal of the square @xmath10 supercell ) relaxes by only 0.8% @xmath22 .",
