    "the knowledge of age and chemical composition of stars in early - type galaxies is a fundamental piece in the puzzle of galaxy formation and evolution . for a long time",
    ", optical - wavelength studies in this direction have been hampered by the age - metallicity degeneracy : an age variation of a factor of @xmath03 mimics a metallicity variation of a factor of @xmath02 in the spectra of old stellar populations ( e.g. , faber 1973 ; oconnell 1986 ; worthey 1994 ) .",
    "the effort of various authors during the past two decades culminated in the work of worthey ( 1994 ) , who showed that age and metallicity can be disentangled by the joint use of pairs of line - strength indices , one metal - line and one balmer - line index , measured from the optical spectra of galaxies .",
    "a system of line - strength indices was defined ( the lick / ids system , see burstein et al . 1984 ; worthey et al .",
    "1994 and references therein ; worthey & ottaviani 1997 ) and is now widely used in order to determine the age @xmath2 , metallicity [ @xmath3/h ]  and abundance ratio [ e / fe ]  of stars in galaxies ( [ e / fe ]  is defined in trager et al .",
    "2000a as a way of parameterising deviations from the solar abundance pattern ) .    in practise ,",
    "one compares the indices measured from the optical spectrum of a galaxy to their values predicted by stellar populations models ( provided for example by worthey 1994 ; vazdekis 1999 ; bruzual & charlot 2003 ; thomas , maraston & bender 2003 ) . the stellar @xmath2 , [ @xmath3/h ]  and [ e / fe ]  of the galaxy are the ones of the model whose indices best agree with the measured ones . because each model consists of a single - burst stellar population ( ssp ) whose stars , unlike in real galaxies , all have the same @xmath2 , [ @xmath3/h ]  and [ e / fe ] , the derived stellar parameters are labelled as _ ssp - equivalent_. we will refer to them as @xmath4 , [ @xmath3/h]@xmath5  and [ e / fe]@xmath5 .",
    "early - type galaxies are the most massive stellar systems for which the ssp approximation seems to hold .",
    "therefore , many authors have measured their line - strength indices in order to determine their stellar content ( see for example trager et al .",
    "2000b ; caldwell , rose & concannon 2003 ; denicol et al .",
    "2005 ; thomas et al .",
    "2005 ; clemens et al .",
    ". however , many results suggest that recent star formation occurred in these galaxies ( trager et al .  2000b ; yi et al .  2005 ) , so that a small fraction of their current stellar mass formed few gyr ago .",
    "it is natural to wonder about the meaning of the line - strength indices analysis under such circumstances ( i.e. , in the presence of more than one ssp in the same galaxy ) . how do the ssp - equivalent parameters relate to the average properties of a galaxy and to the ones of the many ssp s that it hosts ? and what do we actually learn from ssp - equivalent parameters ?",
    "previous authors have already looked into this problem .",
    "using a limited number of models of composite stellar populations ( csp ) , trager et al .",
    "( 2000b ) found that the ssp - equivalent age is heavily biased towards the age of the young stars present in a galaxy . in this paper",
    "we address the same questions in a more systematic and extensive way from the point of view of the stellar population models .",
    "we build two sets of csp s by using the models of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 , hereafter bc03 ) and worthey ( 1994 , hereafter w94 ) .",
    "each dataset contains @xmath03@xmath6 csp models composed of one old and one young ssp .",
    "different csp s correspond to different stellar parameters of the parent ssp s .",
    "the old ssp ( ssp@xmath7 ) is always chosen to be more massive than the young one ( ssp@xmath8 ) , as inferred in many early - type galaxies ( e.g. , trager et al .",
    "2000b ; leonardi & worthey 2000 ; jeong et al .",
    "we analyse the line - strength indices of the csp s and derive the corresponding @xmath4 , [ @xmath3/h]@xmath5  and [ e / fe]@xmath5  as is usually done for observed galaxies .",
    "we then analyse how the result depends on the input parameters ( @xmath2@xmath7 , [ @xmath3/h]@xmath7 , [ e / fe]@xmath7 , @xmath2@xmath8 , [ @xmath3/h]@xmath8,[e / fe]@xmath8 and @xmath9=@xmath10/@xmath11 where @xmath12 is the stellar mass ) and on the luminosity - weighted properties of the csp s .",

    "the mass fraction @xmath9 and the age of the young population @xmath2@xmath8  also play a relevant role with the usual degeneracy .",

    "is always much smaller than @xmath14  and lies somewhere between the latter and @xmath2@xmath8 .",
    "this effect was already known ( trager et al .",
    "its explanation is that the determination of @xmath4  relies primarily on balmer - line indices ( see the model grid in fig.[input ] ) .",
    "these are dominated by young stars and therefore @xmath4  is strongly biased towards the age of the young stellar component . as fig.[z&e ] illustrates , the younger ssp@xmath8 the stronger this bias is .",
    "fig.[z&e ] demonstrates that it is not correct to use @xmath4  as an estimate of when a galaxy formed its stars ( yet , this is often done ; see for example clemens et al .",
    "a fair statement would be that _",
    "@xmath4  is a balmer - line - weighted age _ and it should always be kept in mind that such age is strongly biased towards the age of young stellar components .",
    "furthermore , as highlighted by the covariance coefficient and confirmed by fig.[z&e ] , the effect of @xmath2@xmath8 and @xmath9 on @xmath4  is degenerate .",
    "an increasingly older ssp@xmath8 can produce the same @xmath4  as long as @xmath9 is properly increased ( in fig.[z&e ] @xmath9 increases towards decreasing @xmath4  and @xmath14 ) .",
    "as mentioned , ssp - equivalent parameters derived from different balmer - line indices behave substantially in the same way ( i.e. , fig.[z&e ] looks roughly the same for all of them ) .",
    "however , different balmer - line indices are sensitive to the presence of young stars at different levels ( schiavon et al .  2004 ) . because of this @xmath4 , [ @xmath3/h]@xmath5  and [ e / fe]@xmath5  ( of a csp ) computed with different balmer - line indices will not be in agreement .",
    "fig.[differences ] illustrates this concept for a subset of the csp models chosen to have solar chemical composition and @xmath2@xmath7=13 gyr .",
    "it can also be seen that the difference between h@xmath17- and h@xmath18-based ssp - equivalent parameters goes to zero for @xmath9 approaching 0 and 1 and peaks between these two extremes at a position dependent on @xmath2@xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , fig.[differences ] shows once more the degeneracy between @xmath2@xmath8 and @xmath9 . the same difference between , for example ,",
    "@xmath2@xmath22 and @xmath2@xmath25 can be caused by increasingly older ssp@xmath8 s as long as the mass fraction @xmath9 is sufficiently increased .",

    "each point corresponds to a bc03 csp model .",
    "the presence of a young stellar population on top of an old one causes ssp - equivalent parameters based on different balmer - line indices to disagree .",
    "this effect must be and indeed is observable simultaneously in @xmath4 , [ @xmath3/h]@xmath5  and [ e / fe]@xmath5 . in particular , points seem to be distributed along a very tight relation in the age - metallicity plane.,width=302 ]    for clarity fig.[differences ] shows only a subset of the csp models .",
    "a similar trend is anyway observed in the whole sample ( and in w94 dataset ) , showing that it is possible to detect the presence of a young stellar component on the basis of the disagreement between ssp - equivalent parameters obtained with different balmer - line indices .",
    "we actually expect that more dramatic disagreements in , for example , @xmath4  are accompanied by larger differences in [ @xmath3/h]@xmath5  and [ e / fe]@xmath5 .",
    "this is indeed observed and showed in fig.[totaldeltas ] , where the difference between h@xmath17- and h@xmath18-based [ @xmath3/h]@xmath5  and [ e / fe]@xmath5  is plotted versus the difference in @xmath4 .",
    "in particular the age - metallicity plot shows a very tight relation .",
    "this could be used in order to test the correctness of one s results .",
    "different balmer lines can be used as a diagnostic for the presence of a young stellar component only as long as the differences in the ssp - equivalent parameters are larger than the observational errors . these are typically of 0.1 on the logarithm of @xmath4  and on [ @xmath3/h]@xmath5  and of 0.05 on [ e / fe]@xmath5  ( see for example trager et al .  2000a ;",
    "thomas et al .  2005 ) .",
    "fig.[totaldeltas ] shows that with these errors @xmath4  measurements are the most efficient in revealing a young component , allowing the detection of ssp@xmath8 s younger than @xmath02.5 gyr . as suggested by fig.[differences ] , this is however possible only within a certain range of @xmath9 .",
    "the actual range depends on @xmath2@xmath8 but we find it to be roughly between 1% and 10% .",
    "[ @xmath3/h]@xmath5  and [ e / fe]@xmath5  are only sensitive to ssp@xmath8 s younger than @xmath01.5 gyr with @xmath9 between 2% and 10% .",
    "it is important to stress that for @xmath2610% there is no detectable difference between the ssp - equivalent parameters derived from different balmer - line indices . at these values of @xmath9",
    "the balmer - line indices are so heavily dominated by the younger populations that they all `` see '' the same age , which is very close to the age of the young population .    - and h@xmath18-based @xmath4  plotted versus the h@xmath18-based [ @xmath3/h ] .",
    "there is a clear trend that gives larger @xmath4  discrepancies at larger [ @xmath3/h]@xmath5.,width=245 ]    fig.[differences ] and fig.[totaldeltas ] show another interesting feature : the largest difference between @xmath2@xmath27 and @xmath2@xmath28 in fig.[differences ] is small compared to the one in fig.[totaldeltas ] .",
    "recall that fig.[differences ] is relative to csp s where both ssp@xmath7 and ssp@xmath8 have solar chemical composition , while fig.[totaldeltas ] represents the whole bc03 sample , with [ @xmath3/h ]  growing significantly above solar .",
    "the two figures suggest that [ @xmath3/h ]  plays an important role with respect to the difference @xmath2@xmath27@xmath2@xmath28 .",
    "fig.[newfind ] shows that indeed high ( and therefore more easily detectable ) differences in @xmath4  occurr only at high metallicities .",
    "similar plots hold for the difference in [ @xmath3/h ]  and [ e / fe ] .",
    "we therefore find that the use of more than one balmer - line index can reveal the presence of a young stellar populations , but that this is possible only for a small range of @xmath2@xmath8 and @xmath9 and depends also on the metallicity of the populations .",
    "we would like to remind the reader that a disagreement between balmer - line - based ssp - equivalent parameters , in principle revealing the presence of a young stellar component , could also result from the approach used when analysing the data .",
    "in particular , it is important to remember that different balmer - line indices respond differently to variations in [ e / fe ] .",
    "thomas et al .  ( 2004 ) and thomas & davies ( 2006 ) pointed out that this causes a discrepancy between ssp - equivalent parameters determined from different balmer - line indices when using as a comparison models with solar [ e / fe ]  only .",
    "this effect could mimic the presence of a young stellar component .",
    "however , no such problem should occur when using models that account properly for [ e / fe ]   variations , as was done here .",
    "another delicate point when using balmer - line indices is their increase caused by hot star populations like blue horizontal branch stars or blue stragglers ( maraston & thomas 2000 ; trager et al .",
    "although this is not an issue for the present study , where we do not explore the metal - poor regime at which these stars are expected to be found , this problem should always be kept into consideration when dealing with real data .",
    "we have built two datasets of composite stellar populations ( csp ) using bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) and worthey ( 1994 ) models . each csp model in the datasets consists of an old single - burst stellar population ( ssp@xmath7 ) and a younger , less massive one ( ssp@xmath8 ) .",
    "we have investigated how the ssp - equivalent parameters determined by measuring the lick / ids line - strength indices of the csp s depend on the stellar parameters of ssp@xmath7 and ssp@xmath8 . by means of covariance coefficients",
    "we have found that , regardless of the particular stellar populations models used in building the csp s and of the balmer - line index used for the analysis : @xmath4 , the ssp - equivalent age , depends primarily on @xmath2@xmath8 , the age of the young population , and @xmath9 , the mass fraction between the two populations ; variations in [ @xmath3/h]@xmath5 , the ssp - equivalent metallicity , are mostly driven by variations in [ @xmath3/h]@xmath7 , the metallicity of the old population ; and [ e / fe]@xmath5 the ssp - equivalent abundance ratio , depends mainly on [ e / fe]@xmath7 , the abundance ratio of the old population .",
    "furthermore , we have found that [ @xmath3/h]@xmath5  and [ e / fe]@xmath5  track quite closely the @xmath1-band luminosity - weighted metallicity and abundance ratio ( [ @xmath3/h]@xmath15  and [ e / fe]@xmath15 ) except in case of very young ( and significantly massive ) ssp@xmath8 . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath4  does not follow @xmath14 , being strongly biased towards the the age @xmath2@xmath8 of the young population .",
    "the ssp - equivalent age @xmath4  is simply a balmer - line - weighted age _ and should not be interpreted as the time passed since the formation of most of the stars in a galaxy .",
    "_    finally , as found by schiavon et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , using more than one balmer - line index can reveal the presence of a young stellar component on top of an old one . in this case ,",
    "ssp - equivalent parameters derived from different balmer - line index give discrepant results .",
    "this is true however only for values of @xmath9 between 1% and 10% and for @xmath2@xmath292.5 gyr assuming typical errors on @xmath4 , [ @xmath3/h]@xmath5  and [ e / fe]@xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , these discrepancies are higher at supersolar [ @xmath3/h]@xmath5 .",
