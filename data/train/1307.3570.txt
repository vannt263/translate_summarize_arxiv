    "_ , 2012 ) and the _ atmospheric imaging assembly _ instrument ( aia ; lemen _ et al .",
    "_ , 2012 ) onboard the _ solar dynamics observatory _ satellite ( sdo ) .",
    "hmi measures the motion of the solar photosphere and produces line - of - sight ( los ) observables every 45 seconds like , amongst others , doppler velocity and continuum intensity .",
    "aia images the sun in 10 uv and euv channels .",
    "the channels at 1600   and 1700   are adapted to helioseismic studies ( _ e.g. _ hill et _ al . _ , 2011 ; howe _ et al .",
    "_ , 2011 ; howe _ et al .",
    "_ , 2012 ; rajaguru _ et al .",
    "_ , 2012 ) .",
    "combining these four hmi and aia datasets makes it possible to sample the entire photosphere .",
    "indeed , the approximate formation heights of their signals are @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 km .",
    "therefore sdo allows multi - height helioseismic studies over the entire solar disk with unprecedented resolution and temporal cadence .",
    "this feature adds a third dimension to helioseismic measurements that should prove useful to deal with issues of wave propagation and properties in the photosphere .    here",
    "an hankel - fourier transform ( braun , duvall , and labonte , 1987 ) is applied to 14 sunspots and four quiet - sun regions observed by hmi and aia . while couvidat ( 2013 ) studied the power reduction and enhancement in the f- and p - oscillation modes ,",
    "we focus on scattering phase shifts between ingoing and outgoing solar oscillation modes at given atmospheric heights , and between ingoing ( or outgoing ) modes at two different heights .",
    "( 1992 ) and braun ( 1995 ) measured the phases of ingoing and outgoing waves at a given height and showed that scattering by the magnetic field of sunspots produces an outgoing - ingoing phase difference . acoustic scattering at a given temporal frequency ( _ i.e. _ under the assumption that any scattering inhomogeneity does not vary over the timescale considered )",
    "is usually described by a scattering matrix .",
    "the arguments of this matrix diagonal elements are the phase shifts resulting , at same wavelength and same frequency , from the scattering . here",
    "we derive these shifts and neglect the matrix off - diagonal elements , describing any coupling between modes of different wavelengths .",
    "the mechanism responsible for scattering phase shifts was unclear at the time of braun _ et al . _",
    "however the authors mentioned that waves interacting with a simple uniform cylinder of increased wave speed produce a positive outgoing - ingoing phase shifts ( their original paper claimed a reduced wave speed , but this was corrected in braun , 1995 ) .",
    "they concluded that no absorption mechanism of wave power is required .",
    "in other words , acoustic power reduction and wave scattering could be produced by two separate phenomena .",
    "note that the authors were careful to refer to wave speed and not sound speed : both are quite different in the presence of strong magnetic fields ( wave speed is a combination of sound and alfvn speeds ) .",
    "braun ( 1995 ) presented a more elaborate theory with a cylinder of increased wave - speed inhomogeneity of finite depth : he concluded that the scattering perturbation is most likely close to the solar surface .",
    "fan , braun , and chou ( 1995 ) modeled the scattering of p - modes in a polytropic atmosphere by inhomogeneities in wave speed , density , and pressure .",
    "they did not explicitely account for the presence of magnetic field , but assumed an increase in wave - speed as a consequence of magnetic pressure inside the sunspots .",
    "they confirmed that the inhomogeneity characteristic depth plays a crucial role in determining the behaviour of the phase shifts .",
    "inside a sunspot , the sound speed is reduced compared to the external medium and this translates into a negative outgoing - ingoing phase difference for acoustic waves ( _ e.g. _ gordovskyy and jain , 2007a ) .",
    "however , in the presence of fields the wave speed is of the order of the fast magneto - acoustic speed , hence the assumption of fan , braun , and chou ( 1995 ) of an increase in wave velocity in strong fields .    acoustic power reduction in sunspots is believed to arise mainly from mode conversion ( _ e.g. _ cally , crouch , and braun , 2003 ) : incoming acoustic waves are partly converted into slow magneto - acoustic gravity ( mag ) waves which guide the energy away from the surface .",
    "this energy appears lost to local helioseismology measurements .",
    "most of the incoming waves are converted into fast mag waves that will constitute the outgoing wavefield measured by hankel transform . with this model",
    "cally , crouch , and braun ( 2003 ) fitted the observed phase shifts of braun ( 1995 ) with only magnetic fields ( no thermal differences between the media outside and inside a sunspot were taken into account ) : it was concluded that the increase in p - mode phase speed inside a sunspot is due to magneto - acoustic coupling between acoustic waves and fast mag waves , and that there is no need for a thermal perturbation to explain the results of braun ( 1995 ) .",
    "( 2005 ) later refined this model by adding the thermal perturbation resulting from the sunspot s magnetic field .",
    "the authors concluded that highly inclined fields ( _ i.e. _ mainly in the sunspot penumbra ) produce large phase differences , even though the main contribution to scattering phase shift seems to arise from the umbral core of sunspots . the indirect effect of magnetic field , _",
    "e.g. _ the sound - speed reduction , was found to have a negligible impact .",
    "to summarize , the scattering phase shift results from an increased phase speed as the incoming acoustic waves are converted into fast mag waves , while the acoustic power reduction results from part of the incoming waves being converted into slow mag waves : power reduction and wave scattering originate from the same phenomenon .",
    "fan , braun , and chou ( 1995 ) took a phenomenological approach based on chou and chen ( 1993 ) but neglected the lorentz force .",
    "gordovskyy and jain ( 2007a ) went a step further : they took into account the changes in pressure , density , and sound speed caused by the field , and the impact of lorentz forces .",
    "they obtained that in sunspot models with vertical fields only , the reduced sound speed results in a negative scattering phase shift , but the lorentz force produces an overall positive phase shift as the incoming acoustic waves turn into fast mag modes .",
    "previously , gordovskyy , jain , and thompson ( 2006 ) had tested the impact of flaring magnetic fields , _",
    "i.e. _ the presence of inclined fields in the penumbra of sunspots .",
    "however , they had not included the lorentz force in their hydrodynamic equations .",
    "the result is that inclined - enough fields , unlike vertical fields , produce positive scattering shifts because they increase the wave speed .",
    "finally , gordovskyy and jain ( 2007b ) added to their model both inclined fields and the lorentz force , resulting in positive phase shifts for all parameters tested .",
    "overall , a consensus has emerged that positive outgoing - ingoing phase shifts measured by hankel transform with sunspot data result from strong magnetic fields mainly through mode conversion producing an increase in wave speed ( despite a decrease in sound speed ) , and that the presence of inclined fields enhances this process .",
    "furthermore wave scattering is thought to occur very close to the solar surface .",
    "measuring phase shifts is less straightforward than power reduction : longer time series are required , and for the outgoing - ingoing shifts a correction of spurious values resulting from the presence of many unresolved modes is necessary .",
    "the phase differences retrieved are noisy and quite sensitive to this correction .",
    "maybe because of these difficulties , only one dataset seems to have been published so far about such scattering phase shifts : the one of braun _ et al . _",
    "( 1992 ) and braun ( 1995 ) , based on two sunspots .",
    "it seems worthwhile to revisit and expand their results by using more recent seismic data ( from higher - quality instruments ) , and by increasing the sample size of sunspots ( from two to 14 ) .",
    "moreover working with measurements at different photospheric heights instead of just one should provide additional information regarding the physics at play . finally we also aim at providing some diagnostic plots to help refine and test the different models of wave scattering mentioned in this section . with a single measurement height ,",
    "only the phase difference between radially ingoing and outgoing waves can be calculated .",
    "combining two different heights allows the derivation of cross - spectra and phase differences for ingoing ( or outgoing ) waves between two separate altitudes .",
    "no correction is necessary in this case and this provides additional information about wave properties in the photosphere .    in section 2",
    "we briefly remind the reader of the hankel - fourier analysis . in section 3",
    "we describe the data used . in sections 4 and 5 we present our results , and we conclude in section 6 .",
    "the hankel - fourier decomposition is extensively described in braun , duvall , and labonte ( 1987 ) , braun _",
    "( 1992 ) , and braun ( 1995 ) .",
    "our implementation is summarized in couvidat ( 2013 ) . in polar",
    "coordinates [ @xmath4 and as a function of time [ @xmath5 , the wave field [ @xmath6 is decomposed into the components @xmath7\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the azimuthal order , @xmath9 is the horizontal wavenumber , @xmath10 is the cyclical frequency ( @xmath11 is the temporal frequency ) , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are hankel functions of the first and second kind . the coefficients @xmath14 and @xmath15 are complex amplitudes of radially ingoing and radially outgoing waves , respectively .",
    "we compute these coefficients at four heights in the photosphere and pair them to compute cross - spectra .",
    "for instance , the cross - spectrum @xmath16 of ingoing waves between the heights @xmath17 and @xmath18 for the azimuthal order @xmath8 is defined as @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the complex conjugate .",
    "the phase @xmath21 of this cross - spectrum is the argument of @xmath22 @xmath23 where i m is the imaginary part and re is the real part of a complex number .",
    "@xmath21 is therefore the difference between the phase of @xmath24 and the phase of @xmath25 .",
    "similarly , @xmath26 is the phase difference between outgoing and ingoing waves . to increase the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio on such phase measurements , an `` @xmath8-averaged '' phase @xmath27 can be calculated , following braun ( 1995 ) @xmath28 where arg is the argument and",
    "@xmath29 is a weight calculated as @xmath30    the cross - spectrum @xmath31 is used to measure the outgoing - ingoing phase shift at a given ( @xmath32 ) or between two ( @xmath33 ) atmospheric heights",
    ". however @xmath34 must be corrected .",
    "the justification and details for this correction are presented in depth in braun _",
    "( 1992 ) and braun ( 1995 ) .",
    "briefly , its necessity stems from the fact that within a grid element centered on ( @xmath35 ) there are many unresolved oscillation modes .",
    "the correction [ @xmath36 to apply is estimated from a set of solar oscillation frequencies , is independent of @xmath8 , and is defined as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the angular frequency of the mode with radial order @xmath39 and wavenumber @xmath9 .",
    "here we use a set of oscillation frequencies obtained with the mdi instrument ( scherrer _ et al . _ , 1995 )",
    "onboard soho , during a dynamics run in 2007 .",
    "this set was calculated and provided by rabello - soares and details are available in rabello - soares , korzennik , and schou ( 2008 ) . for modes with orders @xmath39 from 0 to 9 , the maximum degrees @xmath40 available in the set are : 890 , 890 , 860 , 740 , 530 , 440 , 370 , 320 , 260 , and 220 . as pointed out in braun ( 1995 ) , the @xmath41 correction is quite sensitive to the accuracy of the oscillation frequencies used . on the other hand , phases of cross - spectra @xmath27 and @xmath42 ( with @xmath33 )",
    "do not require any correction .    to further increase the s / n ratio on these phase shifts , a `` ridge - averaged @xmath8-averaged '' phase difference can be calculated , for instance @xmath43 , again following braun ( 1995 ) @xmath44 ) \\",

    "the denominators in equations 4 and 7 can be dropped since we take the argument .",
    "a mask is applied to the cross - spectra , to only select power within this ridge .",
    "braun ( 1995 ) and fan , braun , and chou ( 1995 ) demonstrated that @xmath46 peaks at the azimuthal order @xmath47 and drops quickly with @xmath8 .",
    "figure 3 of fan , braun , and chou ( 1995 ) shows that for @xmath48 mm , tan(@xmath46 ) @xmath49 tan(@xmath50 ) .",
    "therefore , in the calculation of the `` @xmath8-averaged '' phase differences , we select as maximum value of @xmath51 at each @xmath9 the one such as @xmath52 is close to 25 mm .    even though we refer to @xmath27 ( equation 4 ) and @xmath43 ( equation 7 ) as `` average '' phase differences , they do not result from a straightforward averaging but are the phase differences of an average over the complex amplitudes @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( sometimes called a vector - average phase ) .",
    "both averaging schemes can produce results that are quite different .",
    "using the complex representation of phases gets rid of their @xmath55 discontinuity , and , even though this is not a strong scientific justification , is the averaging scheme utilized in braun ( 1995 ) which is used as the comparison basis for our results and for numerous papers based on his results .",
    "however , phase - difference algebraic average and vector average can significantly differ : they both qualitatively return ( mostly ) positive phase shifts in sunspots but they quantitatively differ , especially at high @xmath40 .    moreover , it must be pointed out that only the phases of individual modes make physical sense , but the high noise level on such individual measurements prevents their use and forces us to resort to some averaging scheme . only if the phase shifts of individual modes are independent of @xmath8 does the averaged phase shift represent the shift of an individual mode , but because the shifts of individual modes strongly depend on @xmath8 the physical meaning of the `` average '' shifts computed by equations 4 and 7 is unclear : they do not represent the phase shift of an individual mode , although they are the phase shift of some kind of averaged quantity .",
    "the reader should keep this fact in mind when interpreting our results .",
    "finally , we remind the reader that the polar coordinate system used is centered on a region of interest , _ e.g. _ the center of a sunspot , and the ingoing- and outgoing - wave decomposition is calculated in an annulus with inner radius @xmath56 selected to exclude this sunspot .",
    "the same datasets are used as in couvidat ( 2013 ) : hmi continuum intensity , hmi los doppler velocity , aia 1700  , and aia 1600   intensity maps .",
    "the los magnetic fluxes are estimated from hmi los magnetic - field strength .",
    "each datacube is tracked and postel - projected for four days at snodgrass rotation rate using the mtrack software .",
    "the spatial resolution is @xmath57 heliocentric degrees and the temporal cadence is @xmath58 seconds .",
    "tracked cubes have the format : @xmath59 , where the first two dimensions are the spatial coordinates , and the last one is time .",
    "only @xmath60 hours are selected from each cube .",
    "we set @xmath61 mm and @xmath62 mm ( annulus outer radius ) .",
    "the resolution in wavenumber [ @xmath9 ] is @xmath64 mm@xmath65 , _",
    "i.e. _ a resolution in angular degree [ @xmath40 ] equal to @xmath67 ( where @xmath68 mm is the solar radius ) .",
    "the resolution in temporal frequency [ @xmath11 ] is @xmath70 @xmath71hz .",
    "table 1 of couvidat ( 2013 ) lists all of the sunspots studied : note that active region noaa 11263 is not used here because it is too asymmetrical .",
    "braun _ et al . _",
    "( 1992 ) and braun ( 1995 ) pionereed the calculation of scattering phase shifts @xmath72 between outgoing and ingoing waves at the same atmospheric height , using the hankel transform . here",
    "we expand on their results by studying more sunspots and by computing @xmath72 at four different measurement heights .",
    "first , for comparison purpose , we present our results as a function of angular degree @xmath40 and frequency @xmath11 . again , we use a vector - average of phase differences ( like braun , 1995 ) rather than a simple average .",
    "figure [ firstfig ] shows 2d maps of @xmath72 at the four measurement heights .",
    "the phase shifts are averaged over the six strongest  in terms of los magnetic flux  sunspots studied : noaa 11092 , 11289 , 11314 , 11384 , 11408 , and 11410 .",
    "the four maps look very similar : each shows an increase in phase difference toward larger @xmath40 and larger @xmath11 .",
    "no f - modes are shown because no phase shift could be measured for @xmath73 .",
    "our results for the strongest sunspots are very similar to those of braun ( 1995 ) .",
    "moreover , the phase - difference maps for quiet - sun regions show a relatively small negative @xmath72 increasing ( in absolute value ) with @xmath40 .",
    "braun ( 1995 ) argued that this negative phase shift is due to an imperfect correction @xmath41 , resulting from errors in the frequencies and/or angular degrees of the oscillation modes measured .",
    "indeed , a simple reduction in @xmath40 by a couple of parts in a thousand flattens the quiet - sun curves of @xmath72 as a function of @xmath40 . following braun _",
    "( 1992 ) , in the rest of this paper we subtract an average over the four quiet - sun regions of the phase shifts from all of the shifts obtained in sunspots : we are primarily interested in separating the impact of magnetic fields of sunspots from other influences .",
    "the shifts are only known modulo @xmath55 , which means that some values can be corrected by adding or subtracting @xmath74 .",
    "although there is a part of subjectivity in selecting which values to correct , due to their noisy nature , in most cases detecting `` bad '' phases is straightforward : _",
    "e.g. _ , if a shift at a given @xmath40 is strongly negative while the surrounding ( in terms of @xmath40 ) shifts are strongly positive , @xmath74 is added to the negative phase shift .     between outgoing and ingoing waves at four different atmospheric heights .",
    "each map is an average over the results of the six strongest sunspots of our sample .",
    "the f - mode ridge is not shown as no phase difference could be measured . ]",
    "figure [ thirdfig ] shows the average of @xmath72 over the six strongest sunspots as a function of angular degree @xmath40 for p - modes with radial order @xmath75 ( upper left panel ) to @xmath76 ( lower right panel ) and for the four measurement heights . at low-@xmath39",
    "we display phase shifts for @xmath40 larger than those shown in braun ( 1995 ) .",
    "the limiting factor regarding which @xmath40 ( or @xmath11 ) values can be reached is mainly the set of solar oscillation frequencies used to determine the @xmath41 correction .",
    "a new result is that the outgoing - ingoing phase shifts appear mostly independent of the atmospheric height at which the signal is measured . indeed , for p - modes @xmath75 to @xmath77",
    ", the shifts do not seem to change with height ( again , after a quiet - sun average was subtracted ) .",
    "this lack of strong dependence on atmospheric height indicates that most of the scattering of acoustic waves occurs very close to , or below , the continuum level and that not much occurs higher in the photosphere .",
    "this situation contrasts significantly with what was obtained for the power - reduction of outgoing waves in sunspots ( couvidat 2013 ) : a strong dependence on measurement height was observed . in particular acoustic glories ( haloes ) that strongly impact",
    "the acoustic power reduction coefficients seem to have less influence on the scattering phase shifts .",
    "acoustic glories are most obvious in the @xmath78 mhz range , where our ability to measure phase shifts is limited ( the noise level is higher ) , but power enhancement appears at frequencies as low as 4 mhz in a few sunspots while in more typical active regions and at @xmath79 mhz the power reduction coefficient drops from @xmath49 at continuum level to less than @xmath80 at aia 1600 level . here ,",
    "for @xmath81 to 7 the scattering phases at @xmath82 mhz do not show such a significant change with measurement height . at higher @xmath39",
    "the hmi continuum might differ from the other datasets , but the results are too noisy to draw firm conclusions .",
    "gordovskyy and jain ( 2007b ) referred to a preliminary work suggesting that a significant contribution to the phase shifts arise from the part of the flux tube above the surface .",
    "however , our results do not support this statement and hint at a limited role in the scattering for the tube above the surface .",
    "following gordovskyy and jain ( 2007b ) we fitted @xmath83 as a function of @xmath40 for a given @xmath39 by a power law ( @xmath84 ) , but only in a restricted range of @xmath40 and for modes @xmath75 to @xmath85 .",
    "the best fits return @xmath86 , compatible with a strong convergence of the magnetic field : in the model of gordovskyy and jain ( 2007b ) , convergence refers to how quickly the flux tube cross - section decreases by a factor of two with depth . in other words ,",
    "the measured phase shifts are compatible with the presence of strongly inclined fields in the sunspots studied .",
    "we also fitted @xmath72 as a function of @xmath40 by a power law ( @xmath87 ) : a better agreement is obtained over the entire range of accessible @xmath40 , with @xmath88 ( for @xmath75 to @xmath85 ) .",
    "this power law does not match figure 8 of fan , braun , and chou ( 1995 ) and figure 9 of gordovskyy and jain ( 2007b ) : on these two figures the derivative of @xmath72 with respect to @xmath40 decreases for , roughly , @xmath89 , which is clearly not the case on figure [ thirdfig ] .",
    "fan , braun , and chou ( 1995 ) concluded that the born approximation they used does not hold for the large phase differences reached at higher @xmath40 .",
    "figure [ thirdfigc ] shows the average of @xmath72 as a function of mode frequencies @xmath11 and for different radial orders @xmath39 .",
    "again , these results are very close to those obtained by braun ( 1995 ) as shown on figure 11 of crouch _ et al . _",
    "( 2005 ) , and the scattering phase shift clearly increases with @xmath11 .",
    "we also fitted @xmath72 as a function of @xmath11 by a power law ( @xmath90 ) over the entire range of @xmath11 accessible and obtained values of @xmath91 ranging from @xmath92 to @xmath93 ( for @xmath75 to @xmath85 ) .",
    "the presence of negative phase shifts at low @xmath40 and @xmath11 ( _ e.g. _ on figures [ firstfig ] , [ thirdfig ] , and [ thirdfigc ] ) does not seem to be reflected in the models of fan , braun , and chou ( 1995 ) , crouch _ et al . _",
    "( 2005 ) , and gordovskyy and jain ( 2007b ) , but braun ( 1995 ) also measured some negative shifts .",
    "lets assume that these values are real and are not introduced by a faulty @xmath41 correction .",
    "negative phase shifts were mentioned in cally , crouch , and braun ( 2003 ) and interpreted as scattering occuring in the sunspot umbra where the field is nearly vertical .",
    "these authors also predicted that this would lead to a dip at low @xmath8 in @xmath94 .",
    "as will be shown later , the evidence is rather weak here : some oscillation modes show a dip , some do not , but the uncertainty on the measured @xmath94 is too large to draw any firm conclusion .",
    "gordovskyy , jain , and thompson ( 2006 ) also obtained negative phase shifts when neglecting the lorentz force and for low convergence ( _ i.e. _ more vertical ) fields , resulting from the reduced sound speed inside sunspots .",

    "conversely the plateau regime above @xmath182 mhz is not perturbed .",
    "the fact that the oscillation - mode ridges are visible on the ic / v diagram might be partly due to a small change in ridge positions between ingoing and outgoing waves ( see couvidat , 2013 ) : indeed @xmath181 inside the ridges is close to zero , but it is positive at the low - frequency edge of the ridges and negative at their high - frequency edge .",
    "it could also be partly due to a difference in asymmetry ( the `` shark - fin '' shape ) between the peaks of @xmath27 and @xmath42 .",
    "the v / aia 1600 phase diagram shows that the plateau regime above @xmath182 mhz is unchanged between ingoing and outgoing waves , while @xmath27 is @xmath183 larger than @xmath42 in the p - mode ridges .",
    "the aia 1700/aia 1600 phase diagram shows a systematic offset relatively independent of @xmath40 and @xmath184 of @xmath185 between ingoing and outgoing modes ( with @xmath42 larger than @xmath27 ) , showing that the magnetic field affects both propagating and evanescent waves ( for instance by lowering the acoustic cut - off frequency and acting on radiative damping ) .",
    "the v / aia 1700 and v / aia 1600 phase diagrams , like the ic / v one , show a marked impact of magnetic fields in the convective domain ( supergranulation and granulation ) . on the v / aia 1600 phase difference ,",

    "therefore , there is power enhancement . at lower frequencies ,",
    "the power reduction produced by sunspots is also visible .",
    "however , on the @xmath181 phase diagram of the ic / aia 1600 cross - spectrum ( lower left panel of figure [ figj ] ) no discontinuity or significant change is noticeable in the frequency range where acoustic haloes are most obvious : this supports the observation in section 4 that haloes do not seem to impact significantly the phases of outgoing waves .     minus outgoing - outgoing phase difference @xmath42 between two heights @xmath17 and @xmath18 in the photosphere , as a function of angular degree @xmath40 and frequency @xmath11 .",

    "this study continued the work started in couvidat ( 2013 ) and that takes advantage of high quality data provided at different measurement heights by the hmi and aia instruments onboard the sdo satellite .",
    "scattering phase shifts of acoustic waves crossing sunspots , and phase differences of waves between two measurement heights have been computed using an hankel - fourier transform . following braun ( 1995 ) and due to the high noise level on individual measurements ,",
    "all the phase shifts presented here have been averaged to some degree , based on a vector - average scheme rather than a simple algebraic average : both schemes return quantitatively different values .",
    "four types of datasets were utilized : hmi continuum intensity , hmi doppler velocity , aia 1700   intensity , and aia 1600   intensity .",
    "this makes it possible to span the entire photosphere and reach the lower chromosphere .",
    "outgoing - ingoing phase shifts show surprisingly little dependence on atmospheric height ( after quiet - sun results are subtracted ) .",
    "this indicates that scattering by sunspots occurs primarily very low at , or below , the continuum level with little influence of the magnetic field above .",
    "this contrasts with the acoustic power reduction of waves crossing sunspots , which was significantly dependent on measurement height .",
    "power reduction itself occurs deeper underneath the surface than wave scattering , but other phenomena , like acoustic glories ( haloes ) impact acoustic power reduction coefficients above the surface while they appear to have little influence on phase shifts .",
    "the ingoing - ingoing minus outgoing - outgoing phase differences for the ic / aia 1600 cross - spectra support this finding .",
    "when considering only the strongest sunspots in our sample , we obtained scattering phase shifts very similar to those measured by braun ( 1995 ) and we managed to measure them at slightly larger @xmath40 .",
    "these outgoing - ingoing phase shifts show a strong dependence on the los magnetic flux of sunspots , as well as on their surface areas .",
    "when plotted as a function of sunspot intensity contrasts or surface sound speeds , the shifts show little variation at first with the decrease of these quantities , but then exhibit a steep rise as some threshold is reached .",
    "the drop in phase shift with impact parameter @xmath135 favors the idea that wave scattering occurs in an horizontal region smaller than the region of power reduction but slightly larger than the sunspot .",
    "this region also appears to be centered closer to the surface than the power - reduction region and to have a smaller vertical extension .",
    "indeed , the steep decrease in phase shift with inner turning point of acoustic waves contrasts strongly with the curves obtained for power reduction in couvidat ( 2013 ) .",
    "the model of cally , crouch , and braun ( 1993 ) of mode conversion in sunspots convincingly explains this result .",
    "the figures of scattering phase shifts as a function of los magnetic flux , of sunspot radius , of lower turning point @xmath141 , and of intensity contrast , should prove useful to refine and adjust the parameters of theoretical models of wave scattering by sunspots .",
    "several models have been developed in the past , but they were all tested against the only scattering phase shift dataset available so far with the hankel transform ( braun , 1995 ) .",
    "ingoing - ingoing ( or outgoing - outgoing ) phase differences between two different photospheric heights were also measured and exhibit a complex behavior .",
    "the ic / v phase difference is in agreement with earlier studies based on other instruments .",
    "the aia 1600   intensities ( and , to a lesser extent , the aia 1700   ones ) show a clear influence from chromospheric signals : this influence is so significant that it can not be ignored when using aia 1600   for helioseismic studies .",
    "finally , it was also shown that the magnetic field of sunspots has an impact in the supergranulation - granulation domain , and alters the phase difference diagrams in the entire ( @xmath35 ) range studied .",

    "<S> following couvidat ( 2013 ) , we analyze data from the _ helioseismic and magnetic imager _ ( hmi ) and the _ atmospheric imaging assembly _ ( aia ) instruments onboard the _ solar dynamics observatory _ : doppler velocity and continuum intensity at 6173   as well as intensity maps at 1600   and 1700  . datasets of 14 active regions and four quiet - sun regions are studied at four heights in the solar photosphere . </S>",
    "<S> an hankel - fourier analysis is performed around these regions of interest . </S>",
    "<S> outgoing - ingoing scattering phase shifts at a given atmospheric height are computed , as well as ingoing - ingoing and outgoing - outgoing phase differences between two atmospheric heights . </S>",
    "<S> the outgoing - ingoing phase shifts produced by sunspots show little dependence on measurement height , unlike the acoustic power reduction measured in couvidat ( 2013 ) . </S>",
    "<S> phenomena happening above continuum level , like acoustic glories , appear not to have a significant effect on the phases . </S>",
    "<S> however there is a strong dependence on sunspot size , line - of - sight magnetic flux , and intensity contrast . </S>",
    "<S> as previously suggested by other groups , the region of wave scattering appears both horizontally smaller and vertically less extended than the region of acoustic power suppression , and occurs closer to the surface . </S>",
    "<S> results presented here should help refine theoretical models of acoustic wave scattering by magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> ingoing - ingoing phase differences between two measurement heights are also computed and show a complex pattern highly dependent on atmospheric height . in particular , a significant sensitivity of aia signals to lower chromospheric layers is shown . </S>",
    "<S> finally , ingoing - ingoing minus outgoing - outgoing phase differences between various measurement heights are discussed . </S>"
