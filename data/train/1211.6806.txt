    "classical and statistical thermodynamics deal with the equilibrium states of matter @xcite . driving the system from one equilibrium state to another",
    ", however , involves the passage of the system through a sequence of instantaneous states that do not satisfy the conditions for thermodynamic equilibrium , and hence , constitute a non - equilibrium process @xcite .",
    "the description of these processes fall outside the realm of classical and statistical thermodynamics , unless the sequence of non - equilibrium states do not depart appreciably from a sequence of equilibrium states .",
    "such idealized process can be thought of as an infinite sequence of infinitesimally small changes in the driving control parameter , after each of which the system is given sufficient time to equilibrate .",
    "this so - called quasistatic process is an excellent representation of real process when the equilibration times of the system are sufficiently short .",
    "however , when the equilibration kinetics is very slow , virtually any change will involve intrinsically non - equilibrium states whose fundamental understanding must unavoidably be done from the perspective of a non - equilibrium theory @xcite .",
    "these concepts become particularly relevant for the description of the slow dynamics of metastable glass - forming liquids in the vicinity of the glass transition @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the decay time of the slowest relaxation processes ( the so - called @xmath4-relaxation time @xmath16 ) increases without bound as the temperature @xmath17 is lowered below the glass transition temperature @xmath18 .",
    "it is then natural to think that the _ equilibration _ time of the system must also increase accordingly . to be more precise ,",
    "let us imagine that a glass - forming liquid , initially at an arbitrary temperature @xmath19 , is suddenly cooled at time @xmath20 to a final temperature @xmath17 , after which it is allowed to evolve spontaneously toward its thermodynamic equilibrium state .",
    "imagine that we then monitor its @xmath4-relaxation time @xmath21 as a function of the evolution or `` waiting '' time @xmath3 elapsed after the quench .",
    "we say that the system has equilibrated when @xmath21 reaches the plateau that defines its final equilibrium value @xmath22 , which must only depend on the final temperature @xmath17 .",
    "the beginning of this plateau occurs at a certain value of the waiting time @xmath3 , that we refer to as the _ equilibration _ time @xmath23 ; this equilibration time must also depend on the final temperature @xmath17 .",
    "there are strong indications , from recent computer simulation experiments @xcite , that in the metastable regime these two characteristic times , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , are related to each other as @xmath24^\\eta$ ] , with an exponent @xmath25 ( more specifically , @xmath26 @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that in order to measure the actual equilibrium value @xmath22 we have to wait , before starting the measurement of @xmath22 , for an equilibration time @xmath23 that will increase faster than @xmath22 itself .",
    "this poses an obvious practical problem for the measurement of @xmath22 when the temperature @xmath17 approaches the glass transition temperature @xmath18 , since sooner or later we shall be unable to wait this required equilibration time .",
    "this situation then implies that it is impossible to discard a scenario in which the _ equilibrium _ @xmath4-relaxation time @xmath22 diverges at a singular temperature @xmath27 , since the equilibration time @xmath23 needed to observe this divergence will also diverge at that temperature , i.e. , it will be impossible to equilibrate the system at a final temperature near or below @xmath27 within experimental waiting times . of course",
    ", a measurement carried out at a finite @xmath3 , will always report a result for @xmath16 , but this result will correspond to @xmath21 , the non - equilibrium value of the @xmath4-relaxation time registered at that waiting time @xmath3 .",
    "thus , the analysis of these experimental measurements can not be based on the postulate that the system has reached equilibrium ; instead , one needs to interpret these experiments in the framework of a quantitative theory of slowly - relaxing non - equilibrium processes .    until recently",
    ", however , no _ quantitative , first - principles _ theory had been developed and applied to describe the slow _ non - equilibrium _ relaxation of _ structural _ glass - forming atomic or colloidal liquids . about a decade ago latz @xcite attempted to extend the conventional mode coupling theory ( mct ) of the ideal glass transition @xcite , to describe the aging of suddenly quenched glass forming liquids .",
    "a major aspect of his work involved the generalization to non - equilibrium conditions of the conventional equilibrium projection operator approach @xcite to derive the corresponding memory function equations in which the mode coupling approximations could be introduced .",
    "similarly , de gregorio et al .",
    "@xcite discussed time - translational invariance and the fluctuation - dissipation theorem in the context of the description of slow dynamics in system out of equilibrium but close to dynamical arrest .",
    "they also proposed extensions of approximations long known within mct .",
    "unfortunately , in neither of these theoretical efforts , quantitative predictions were presented that could be contrasted with experimental or simulated results in specific model systems of _ structural _ glass - formers .    in an independent but similarly - aimed effort ,",
    "on the other hand , the self - consistent generalized langevin equation ( scgle ) theory of colloid dynamics @xcite and of dynamic arrest @xcite has recently been extended to describe the ( non - equilibrium ) spatially non - uniform and temporally non - stationary evolution of glass - forming colloidal liquids .",
    "such an extension was introduced and described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , and will be referred to as the _ non - equilibrium _ self - consistent generalized langevin equation ( ne - scgle ) theory .",
    "as one can imagine , the number and variety of the phenomena that could be studied with this new theory may be enormous , and to start its systematic application we must focus on simple classes of physically relevant conditions .",
    "thus , as a first simple illustrative application , this theory was applied in ref .",
    "@xcite to a model colloidal liquid with hard - sphere plus short - ranged attractive interactions , suddenly quenched to an attractive glass state .",
    "the aim of the present work is to start a systematic exploration of the scenario predicted by this theory when applied to the simplest irreversible processes , in the simplest and best - defined model system . in the present case",
    "we refer to the irreversible isochoric evolution of a glass - forming liquid of particles interacting through purely repulsive soft - sphere interactions , initially at a fluid - like state , whose temperature is suddenly quenched to a final value @xmath28 , at which the expected equilibrium state is that of a hard - sphere liquid at volume fraction @xmath12 .",
    "such process mimics the spontaneous search for the equilibrium state of this hard - sphere liquid , driven to non - equilibrium conditions by some perturbation ( shear , for example @xcite ) which ceases at a time @xmath20 .",
    "one possibility is that the system will recover its equilibrium state within an equilibration time @xmath6 that depends on the fixed volume fraction @xmath12 .",
    "the other possibility is that the system ages forever in the process of becoming a glass .",
    "the application of the ne - scgle theory to these irreversible processes results in a well - defined scenario of the spontaneous non - equilibrium response of the system , whose main features are explained and illustrated in this paper .    in the following section we provide a brief summary of the non - equilibrium self - consistent generalized langevin equation theory , appropriately written to describe the equilibration of a monocomponent glass - forming liquid constrained to remain spatially uniform .",
    "section [ sectioniii ] defines the specific model to which this theory will be applied , discusses the strategy of solution of the resulting equations , and illustrates the main features of the results .",
    "section [ sectioniv ] presents the scenario predicted by the ne - scgle theory for the first possibility mentioned above , namely , that the system is able to reach its thermodynamic equilibrium state . in this case",
    "we find that the equilibrium @xmath4-relaxation time @xmath29 , and the equilibration time @xmath6 needed to reach it , will remain finite for volume fractions smaller than a critical value @xmath9 , but that both characteristic times will diverge as @xmath12 approaches this dynamic - arrest volume fraction @xmath30 , and will remain infinite for @xmath31 .",
    "although it is intrinsically impossible to witness the actual predicted divergence , the theory makes distinct predictions regarding the transient non - equilibrium evolution occurring within experimentally - reasonable waiting times @xmath3 .    in sect .",
    "[ sectionv ] we analyze the complementary regime , @xmath32 , in which the system , rather than reaching equilibrium within finite waiting times , is predicted to age forever . in this regime",
    "we find that the long - time asymptotic limit of @xmath0 will no longer be the expected equilibrium static structure factor @xmath33 , but another , non - equilibrium but well - defined , static structure factor , that we denote as @xmath34 , and which depends on the protocol of the quench .",
    "furthermore , contrary to the kinetics of the equilibration process , in which @xmath0 approaches @xmath33 in an exponential - like fashion , this time the decay of @xmath0 to its asymptotic value @xmath34 follows a much slower power law .",
    "in section [ sectionvi ] we put together the two regimes just described , in an integrated picture , which outlines the predicted scenario for the crossover from equilibration to aging . there",
    "we find that the discontinuous and singular behavior underlying the previous scenario is intrinsically unobservable , due to the finiteness of the experimental measurements , which constraints the observations to finite time windows .",
    "this practical but fundamental limitation converts the discontinuous dynamic arrest transition into a blurred crossover , strongly dependent on the protocol of the experiment and of the measurements .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to explain in sufficient detail the methodological aspects of the application of the theory , so as to serve as a reliable reference for the eventual application of this non - equilibrium theory to the same system but with different non - equilibrium processes ( e.g. , different quench protocols ) , or in general to different systems and processes .",
    "thus , we shall not report here the results of the systematic quantitative comparison of the scenario explained here with available specific simulations or experiments , which are being reported separately .",
    "thus , the final section of the paper briefly refers to the main features of those comparisons , and discusses possible directions for further work .",
    "let us mention that the referred non - equilibrium self - consistent generalized langevin equation ( ne - scgle ) theory derives from a non - equilibrium extension of onsager s theory of thermal fluctuations @xcite , and it consists of the time evolution equations for the mean value @xmath35 and for the covariance @xmath36 of the fluctuations @xmath37 of the local concentration profile @xmath38 of a colloidal liquid .",
    "these two equations are coupled , through a local mobility function @xmath39 , with the two - time correlation function @xmath40 .",
    "a set of well - defined approximations on the memory function of @xmath41 , detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite , results in the referred ne - scgle theory .    as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , for given interparticle interactions and applied external fields , the ne - scgle self - consistent theory is in principle able to describe the evolution of a strongly correlated liquid from an initial state with arbitrary mean and covariance @xmath42 and @xmath43 , towards its equilibrium state characterized by the equilibrium local concentration profile @xmath44 and equilibrium covariance @xmath45 .",
    "these equations are in principle quite general , and contain well known theories as particular limits . for example , ignoring certain memory function effects , the evolution equation for the mean profile @xmath35 becomes the fundamental equation of dynamic density functional theory @xcite , whereas the  conventional \" equilibrium scgle theory @xcite ( analogous in most senses to mct @xcite ) is recovered when full equilibration is assumed and spatial heterogeneities are suppressed . the ne - scgle theory , however , provides a much more general theoretical framework , which in principle describes the spatially heterogeneous and temporally non - stationary evolution of a liquid toward its ordinary stable thermodynamic equilibrium state .",
    "this state , however , will become unreachable if well - defined dynamic arrest conditions arise along the equilibration pathway , in which case the system evolves towards a distinct and predictable dynamically arrested state through an evolution process that involves aging as an essential feature .    to start the systematic application of this general theory to more specific phenomena",
    "we must focus on a simple class of physical conditions .",
    "thus , let us consider the irreversible evolution of the structure and dynamics of a system _ constrained _ to suffer a programmed process of spatially _ homogeneous _ compression or expansion ( and/or of cooling or heating ) . under these conditions , rather than solving the time - evolution equation for @xmath46",

    "the zero - temperature limit of this transition line corresponds to the critical volume fraction @xmath135 .",
    "thus , the evolution of the system after the temperature quench from an initial temperature @xmath176 to a final temperature @xmath274 is dramatically different if the volume fraction of the isochoric process is smaller or larger than this critical volume fraction .",
    "however , in order to actually witness this dramatic difference , we would have to perform observations at volume fractions infinitesimally closer to @xmath9 , and within an evolution time window much larger ( in fact , infinite ) than in any real experiment or simulation .",
    "in fact , what we would like to illustrate now is that the experimental observation of the consequences of this theoretically - predicted singularity will be blurred by this unavoidable finiteness of the time window of any experimental observation . to see this ,",
    "let us display the same information presented in fig .",
    "[ fig14](a ) , which plots @xmath435 as a function of @xmath3 for a sequence of volume fractions @xmath12 , in a complementary format .",
    "this is done in fig .",
    "[ fig14](b ) , which plots @xmath435 as a function of @xmath12 for a sequence of waiting times @xmath3 .",
    "the main feature to notice in each of the curves corresponding to a fixed waiting time @xmath3 , is that one can distinguish two regimes in volume fraction , namely , the low-@xmath12 ( equilibrated ) regime and the high-@xmath12 ( non - equilibrated ) regime , separated in a continuous fashion , and not as an abrupt transition , by a crossover volume fraction @xmath15 . focusing , for example , on the results corresponding to @xmath442 , we notice that @xmath443 . in fig .",
    "[ fig14](b ) we have highlighted the crossover points @xmath444 , @xmath445 , corresponding to each waiting time @xmath3 considered .",
    "we observe that the resulting crossover volume fraction @xmath15 first increases rather fast with @xmath3 , but then slows down considerably , reaching a theoretical maximum crossover volume fraction , @xmath446 , given by @xmath135 , as indicated in the inset of the figure .",
    "the scenario illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig14](b ) has additional physical implications .",
    "although it is impossible to witness the infinite - time implications of the theoretically - predicted singular dynamic arrest transition , it is important to stress that its finite - time consequences , such as those illustrated in this figure , can be predicted , and could be corroborated by performing measurements at _ intentionally _ finite , accessible waiting times .",
    "it is thus important to test if these predictions make sense by comparing them with available experimental or simulation data .",
    "although this comparison falls out of the scope of the present paper , we can say that the picture that emerges from the predicted dependence of @xmath435 on waiting time and volume fraction just discussed , is fully consistent with the most relevant qualitative features observed in a simulation experiment consisting precisely of the equilibration of a hard - sphere liquid , initially prepared in a non - equilibrium state @xcite .",
    "in fact , such simulation experiment was originally inspired by the very initial version of the theoretical scenario of the present non - equilibrium theory .",
    "to have an idea of the level of agreement , in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig14](b ) we have included the simulation data for the evolution of the crossover volume fraction @xmath15 with waiting time reported in ref @xcite . in a separate communication @xcite we shall analyze in detail other aspects of the comparison between the predictions of the ne - scgle theory and available simulation results , which indicates a general agreement and exhibits some well - defined limitations of the present non - equilibrium theory .",
    "in summary , in this work we have started the systematic exploration of the predicted ne - scgle scenario of the irreversible isochoric evolution of a soft - sphere glass - forming liquid whose temperature is suddenly quenched from its initial value @xmath19 to a final value @xmath28 . as we explained here",
    ", the response falls in two mutually exclusive possibilities : either the system will reach its new equilibrium state within an equilibration time @xmath6 that depends on the fixed volume fraction @xmath12 , or the system ages forever in the process of becoming a glass .    in the first case the equilibrium @xmath4-relaxation time @xmath29 , and the equilibration time @xmath6 needed to reach thermodynamic equilibrium , are predicted to remain finite for volume fractions smaller than a critical value @xmath30 , but as @xmath12 approaches this hard - sphere dynamic - arrest volume fraction , both characteristic times will diverge and will remain infinite for @xmath31 .",
    "although it is intrinsically impossible to witness the actual predicted divergence , the theory makes distinct predictions regarding the transient non - equilibrium evolution occurring within experimentally - reasonable waiting times @xmath3 , which could , thus , be compared with realizable experiments or simulations .",
    "this applies even more to the predictions regarding the complementary regime , @xmath32 , in which the system , rather than ever reaching equilibrium , is predicted to age forever . as discussed in the previous section , under these circumstances the long - time asymptotic limit of @xmath0",
    "will no longer be the expected equilibrium static structure factor @xmath33 , but the non - equilibrium , but well - defined , dynamically arrested static structure factor @xmath34 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath0 is predicted to approach @xmath34 in a much slower fashion ( a power law ) , in contrast with the exponential - like manner in which @xmath0 approaches @xmath33 when the system equilibrates .",
    "putting together the two regimes just described , we have presented the scenario predicted to emerge for the crossover from equilibration to aging .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the discontinuous and singular behavior is intrinsically unobservable in practice , due to the finiteness of the time windows of experimental measurements .",
    "this forces the discontinuous dynamic arrest transition to appear as a blurred crossover , which may depend on the protocol of the experiment and of the measurements .",
    "testing these predictions by comparing them with available experimental or simulation data is an issue that we shall leave for future studies , since the main purpose here was to provide the details of the methodologies needed to solve the equations that define the ne - scgle , and to illustrate its use with the application to the specific system and processes considered here .",
    "as indicated at the end of the previous section , we can say that the picture that emerges from the predicted dependence of @xmath435 on waiting time and volume fraction is consistent with the most relevant qualitative features observed in the simulation experiment of the equilibration of the hard - sphere liquid @xcite . in a separate paper",
    "we shall establish a more direct contact with those simulation results , and with other simulation or experimental data .    in the meanwhile",
    ", it will also be interesting to interrogate the ne - scgle theory on the variations of the scenario just described , when the system and conditions employed here are modified .",
    "for example , one may be interested in understanding how this scenario might change when protocol of the quench is modified .",
    "other questions may refer to the dependence of this scenario on the particular class of model system and interactions ( involving here only soft repulsions ) , particularly when attractive forces are incorporated .",
    "the answer to these questions will surely use the methods and experience developed in the presented work , and will be the subject of future research ."
