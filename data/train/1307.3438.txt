    "recently refined experimental techniques based on ultracold gases in optical lattices @xcite and femtosecond spectroscopy @xcite allow for studies of systems out of equilibrium .",
    "such studies require a very good decoupling from the environment to realize long observation times during which the system is out of equilibrium .",
    "one way to push the system far out of equilibrium is to switch intrinsic system parameters abruptly .",
    "such a scenario is called a quench . in interaction",
    "quenches the system is prepared initially in eigenstates of a non - interacting hamiltonian . at a specific time the interaction is suddenly turned on and the state of the system is no longer an eigenstate of the ( quenched ) hamiltonian .",
    "typically , the quenched systems are in highly excited states with respect to the quenched hamiltonian . thus their dynamics is governed by processes on all energy scales including high energies .",
    "properties may occur which are totally different from the equilibrium ones .",
    "the necessity to include all energy scales makes theoretical calculations , numerical or analytical ones , notoriously difficult .",
    "so far , the majority of theoretical investigations were focussed on one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems , on infinite - dimensional ( @xmath0d ) systems , and on small finite systems because for these cases powerful tools are available . for 1d systems ,",
    "the tool box is best : quantum field theoretical descriptions provide analytical approaches , see , e.g. , refs .   .",
    "the best understood models remain those which correspond to non - interacting fermionic or bosonic systems @xcite or models which are effectively close to non - interacting ones @xcite .",
    "time - dependent density - matrix renormalization is a powerful numerical tool which enables to study non - equilibrium phenomena in 1d systems @xcite .",
    "the other dimensionality allowing for well - controlled studies is @xmath0d where dynamical mean - field theory becomes exact @xcite and gutzwiller approaches are well justified @xcite .",
    "exact diagonalization is completely flexible concerning dimensionality , but it is restricted to small systems @xcite .",
    "so far , the question to which extent strongly conserved quantities restrict or even prevent relaxation was in the center of interest @xcite .",
    "thus , integrable systems and systems close to integrability were studied , which drew the interest to 1d systems .",
    "studies of two - dimensional ( 2d ) models out of equilibrium are still rare .",
    "goth and assaad studied the sudden turning off of the interaction in a half - filled 2d hubbard model with 20@xmath120 sites by continuous time quantum monte carlo @xcite .",
    "the large energy put into the system and the simple dynamics induced by the non - interacting hamiltonian after the quench lead to a well - understood evolution in agreement with the findings of perturbative approaches .",
    "other 2d studies address the influence of a strong electric field on the dynamics of a single charge carrier in a mott insulator @xcite and on a bound pair of two carriers @xcite .    in the present work , we study the interaction quench in the 2d hubbard model far from any integrability .",
    "in contrast to the work by goth and assaad , the interaction is switched _ on _ abruptly . our goal is to assess the time scale on which relaxation takes place in a generic model between one and infinite dimension . the sensitive quantity which we investigate is the momentum distribution @xmath2 and its jump @xmath3 at the fermi surface @xmath4 in particular .",
    "the article is set up as follows .",
    "after this introduction we present the model studied and the method used in sect .",
    "[ sec : mod_n_meth ] . in the subsequent sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] the results for the momentum distribution and its jump at the fermi surface will be presented . the scenario for",
    "prethermalization will be an important issue as well as an estimate of relaxation rates . in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclude ] the article is concluded .",
    "the hamiltonian under study is @xmath5 with the hopping parameter @xmath6 ; @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote nearest neighbors on the square lattice .",
    "the fermionic annihilation ( creation ) operator at site @xmath7 with spin @xmath9 is denoted by @xmath10 and @xmath11 counts the fermions at site @xmath7 . profiting from translational invariance we directly address the infinite model in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the colons indicate normal ordering with respect to the fermi sea , which is the ground state of the non - interacting model and the initial state of the quench . the interaction @xmath12 is suddenly turned on at @xmath13 so that the time evolution is governed by the interacting hamiltonian .",
    "we use the band width @xmath14 as a natural energy scale and @xmath15 is set to unity so that time is measured in the inverse band width @xmath16 .",
    "the time evolution of the jump @xmath3 is used as sensitive probe for the dynamics after the quench .",
    "its initial value is unity .",
    "the momentum distribution is calculated by an expansion of the heisenberg equations of motion ( eom ) for an operator @xmath17 @xmath18\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to the highest order possible @xcite .",
    "we consider @xmath19 .",
    "the eom are iterated by recursive commutation with @xmath20 yielding more and more operators which we represent in real space @xcite . as each commutation implies one additional order in time @xmath21 the results obtained after @xmath22 commutations are exact at least up to @xmath23 .",
    "we emphasize , however , that we are not computing a plain series in powers of time . in the algebraic part",
    ", we derive a set of differential equations which allow for the determination of the series up to @xmath23 .",
    "this means that the solution of the approximate differential equations has the same expansion in powers of @xmath21 as the exact solution .",
    "but here we do not present results for the series , but for the full solution of the approximate differential equation which turn out to be more stable and reliable up to longer times than the plain series .",
    "thus the order @xmath22 of the calculation is a control parameter of the approximation which becomes exact for @xmath24 , but it does not refer to the maximum order of a truncated series .",
    "due to the exponentially rising number of terms to be tracked for increasing @xmath22 one has to stop at values of @xmath22 of the order 10 .",
    "the results are well - controlled @xcite for about @xmath25 . for the 2d model , up to @xmath26 commutations",
    "are performed and the data is shown up to times for which the results are reliable .",
    "this can be inferred from the comparison of the curves for various numbers @xmath22 , which display convergence upon increasing @xmath22 , see also refs .  .",
    "the approach sketched above is applied to the fermionic creation operator . in this way , the time dependence of expectation values such as @xmath27 becomes accessible .",
    "fourier transformation of these expressions yields the momentum distribution .",
    "we show a complete view on the momentum distribution in the brillouin zone in fig .",
    "[ fig : md ] as function of time . since many points in momentum space",
    "have to be evaluated we have to restrict ourselves to @xmath28 commutations . thus the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : md ] is not of the highest accuracy for the longer time , but it renders an excellent overview .",
    "all other figures present data for @xmath29 commutations .    for the relatively large values @xmath30 , the momentum distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig : md ] shows oscillations over the whole brillouin zone . at the instants at which the jump vanishes ,",
    "see panel @xmath31 , the distribution is featureless and almost constant indicating a state which is essentially local in real space .",
    "but afterwards , the jump re - occurs and the momentum distribution resembles the initial one qualitatively .",
    "thus the total behavior follows a collapse - and - revival scenario .    the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : md ] suggest that it would be very fascinating to observe such a behavior in fermionic systems experimentally .",
    "note that collapse - and - revival was observed experimentally after the interaction quench in a bosonic system @xcite .",
    "but there is an essential qualitative difference between the fermionic and the bosonic collapse - and - revival . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : md ] , the fermionic one is characterized by the disappearance and re - appearance of the fermi surface , i.e. , a one - dimensional singularity in the two - dimensional brillouin zone .",
    "in contrast , the bosonic collapse - and - revival is related to the disappearance and re - appearance of a zero - dimensional singularity , namely of a @xmath32-function in the bosonic momentum distribution at the center ( @xmath33 point ) of the brillouin zone .    .",
    "only one quadrant of the brillouin zone is shown due to point group symmetry .",
    "the data results from @xmath28 commutations . [",
    "fig : md ] ]    we find that the jump @xmath34 behaves very similar at all points of the fermi surface .",
    "no significant difference between the jumps at the corners of the fermi surface , i.e. , at @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and those at the middle of the edges , i.e. , at @xmath37 . appears up to the time - scales investigated .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : momentum - depend ] for the jump @xmath38 at the given momenta on the fermi surface , see legend .",
    "note that the difference between curves for different momenta first increases on increasing @xmath39 before decreasing again for larger @xmath39 . in any case , it remains small even for @xmath40 up to the time scales investigated . in the remainder , we will only show results for @xmath41 for simplicity if not stated otherwise .",
    "calculated at two positions on the fermi surface for various interaction strengths @xmath39 .",
    "the curves for @xmath42 change their style for larger times ; then we do not consider them fully reliable anymore .",
    "[ fig : momentum - depend ] ]      in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp2d1d ] we compare the quench dynamics in 1d and in 2d at half - filling for various values of @xmath39 .",
    "our findings provide evidence that in 2d the same dynamical transition exists between quenches to weak and to strong interactions that was observed previously in @xmath0d @xcite , by gutzwiller approach @xcite , and in 1d @xcite . for quenches to stronger interactions ( @xmath43 )",
    "one observes dominant oscillations which decay slowly . at half - filling ,",
    "these oscillations display zeros in the jump @xmath44 as in the previous cases @xcite .",
    "away from half - filling , the minima still exist , but they are no longer at @xmath45 ( not shown ) .",
    "for various @xmath39 in half - filled hubbard models : solid lines show the 2d , the dashed lines of the corresponding gray scale / color show the 1d data .",
    "[ fig : comp2d1d ] ]    for quenches to weak and moderate interactions we observe a decay of @xmath44 with only hardly visible oscillations , cf .  the curves for @xmath46 .",
    "these oscillations can be attributed to the finite band width @xmath47 , i.e. , the frequency of oscillations is the band width @xmath47 .",
    "this explanation is supported by the fact that the oscillations are stronger in 1d than in 2d because the van hove singularities in 1d ( inverse square roots , @xmath48 ) @xcite are much more pronounced than in 2d ( jumps , @xmath49 ) .",
    "this argument is in line with the observations that no oscillations are observed in the infinite dimensional calculations based on the bethe lattice with infinite branching ratio displaying even less pronounced singularities ( square roots , @xmath50 ) @xcite .",
    "another remarkable contrast to the 1d curves consists in the much faster decay of the jump in 2d .",
    "this feature is striking in the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp2d1d ] which all start with the same curvature @xmath51 determined by @xmath39 alone .",
    "we interpret this important qualitative difference by the fact that the decay of the jump in 1d is governed by slowly decreasing power laws @xcite .",
    "the 2d characteristics appears different : the 2d system allows for sufficiently effective scattering mechanisms so that one may expect to observe first signs of true relaxation governed by exponential decay @xmath52 with relaxation rate @xmath53 for longer times .",
    "we will come back to this point below .",
    "for intermediate values of @xmath54 we find a particularly fast decaying jump indicating efficient relaxation indeed , cf .",
    "[ fig : comp2d1d ] .       from the eom ( solid lines ) for quenches to strong interactions , fits based on eq .  .",
    "[ fig : fits_strong ] ]    we proceed to a quantitative analysis by fits . for strong quenches at half - filling",
    "we take the oscillations into account and we allow for relaxation to occur . for the oscillations",
    "we simply include a cosine term , see eq .  .",
    "the relaxation is trickier for the following reason . in the long time",
    "limit it is described by the factor @xmath55 with decay rate @xmath53 .",
    "but around @xmath13 this behavior does not and can not appear because the time dependence induced by hamiltonians , whose local terms are bounded , is analytically smooth .",
    "thus the fit function to describe relaxation must be smooth at @xmath13 and then it must crossover to @xmath55 .",
    "the simplest function we could think of with the desired property is @xmath56 .",
    "obviously , the decay rate at large @xmath21 is given by @xmath57 while the behavior at small @xmath21 is smooth .",
    "the crossover from @xmath58 behavior to @xmath59 behavior occurs at @xmath60 .",
    "thus we use @xmath61 two of the three fit parameters @xmath62 , @xmath57 , and @xmath63 are fitted and the third one is determined by the analytic curvature @xmath51 at @xmath13 .",
    "exemplary fits are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fits_strong ] .",
    "the resulting oscillation periods @xmath64 and values for @xmath57 and @xmath63 are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : param ] to the right of the vertical dotted lines which mark the region between weak and strong quenches .",
    "this region can not be resolved by our present approach ; the weak quenches are considered below in sect .",
    "[ ssc : weak ] .",
    "note that the quantitative description of our data with the fitting function works very nicely .",
    "we are aware , however , that the parameters @xmath57 and @xmath63 resulting from these fits give only estimates for the relaxation rate and the crossover time , respectively . in case another dynamical time scale would govern the behavior at intermediate times it may be that the numbers for @xmath57 and @xmath63 are affected by this intermediate time scale and not by the relaxation at long times .",
    "depict fits which are unstable and can not be done without restrictions in the range of parameters .",
    "the left scale applies to @xmath57 and @xmath63 while the right one to @xmath65 . in the transition region between the two dashed perpendicular lines our data",
    "does not allow us to decide on the nature of the quench , weak or strong .",
    "the constant @xmath66 is set to @xmath67 .",
    "[ fig : param ] ]      the natural next issue are weak quenches and their decay .",
    "indeed , we will address it in the following subsection .",
    "but before doing so it is worth to recall the leading perturbative result in order @xmath68 derived by moeckel and kehrein @xcite which reads @xmath69 for the jump at the fermi surface with @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the number of sites , @xmath72 a wave vector on the fermi surface , @xmath73 if @xmath74 is within the fermi surface and zero otherwise , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .    in infinite dimensions , the multidimensional integral",
    "is shown to yield a constant for @xmath77 so that for weak enough interaction an almost constant plateau appears before relaxation sets in on much longer time scales @xcite .",
    "it is expected that this is the generic behavior in finite dimensions as well .",
    "but it is also known from bosonization @xcite that the 1d case is special because of particularly strong scattering yielding a logarithmic divergence of @xmath78 .",
    "so the question arises what happens in two dimensions ?     as it appears in and",
    "is defined in evaluated in 2d for the half - filled hubbard model at two different momenta on the fermi surface .",
    "logarithmic fits are included .",
    "[ fig : pretherm ] ]    to clarify this issue we evaluated in 2d for the half - filled hubbard model .",
    "this calculation is done in real space up to long times though the limit of infinite time can not be addressed directly .",
    "this is left to future work .",
    "[ fig : pretherm ] displays the results for @xmath78 at momenta @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "unexpectedly , the data indicates a logarithmic divergence for @xmath77 as is revealed by the fits .",
    "this suggests that no prethermalization plateaus arise because the perturbative correction diverges for @xmath77 even for arbitrarily small quenched interaction @xmath39 .",
    "of course , this fact influences the quench dynamics decisively .",
    "so far , we can not prove what the reason is for the non - existence of prethermalization in the 2d hubbard model at half - filling .",
    "but we attribute this non - existence to the perfectly flat stretches of the fermi surface linking the four points @xmath81 and @xmath36 . in the vicinity of these flat regions only the perpendicular momentum transfer matters while the parallel one can be integrated over yielding just a certain prefactor . as a result",
    "the relevant , perpendicular scattering processes behave as if they were acting in 1d .",
    "if this hypothesis turns out to be true , any system doped away from half - filling should show prethermalization because the fermi surface will be curved .",
    "but the time scales , on which the effect of doping becomes visible , are presumably very long for low doping .",
    "thus the interaction values @xmath39 at which plateaus become discernible will be fairly low . further work is called for to elucidate this issue .",
    "we have argued that due the divergence of @xmath78 for @xmath77 the jump in does not display a prethermalization plateau @xcite .",
    "a second corollary is that the strict perturbative result becomes unphysical , namely negative , see , e.g. , dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : fits_weak ] .",
    "this happens even for arbitrarily small @xmath39 if @xmath21 is chosen sufficiently large .",
    "we have to reconcile this behavior with the physical fact @xmath82 because otherwise there is no way to estimate the relaxation .",
    "based on the analogy to the 1d case@xcite we propose the hypothesis that the logarithmic divergence is the signature of a power law behavior _ if _ there were no relaxation . in other words ,",
    "only the deviation from the power law behavior can be taken as sign of relaxation .    in order to use this hypothesis",
    "we pass from the logarithmically diverging to the power law behavior @xmath83 where we omit the corrections @xmath84 .",
    "this result only uses the leading perturbative result , but extrapolates it as a power law .",
    "indeed , a comparison to a diagrammatic analysis based on dynamic cluster theory @xcite shows that weak quenches follow the prediction @xmath85 . for illustration , the dashed - dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : fits_weak ] shows the result from for the case @xmath40 .",
    "note that the solid curves display the full result which can be taken to be exact up to the times shown",
    ".     from the eom ( solid lines ) for quenches to weak interactions , fits based on eq .  .",
    "exemplarily for @xmath40 , the dotted line shows @xmath86 from eq .   and the dashed - dotted line @xmath87 from eq .  .",
    "[ fig : fits_weak ] ]    the perturbative result @xmath87 in eq",
    ".   serves as our reference in the following ansatz @xmath88^{-1/4}+b).\\ ] ] the last factor is again chosen such that it is compatible with all known properties of @xmath38 .",
    "it starts smoothly , all quadratic dependence in @xmath39 is contained in the first factor @xmath87 in _ all _ orders in @xmath21 , and the quadratic behavior in @xmath21 is also fully described by @xmath87 because the @xmath68 term is sufficient to describe the short - time behavior .",
    "this can be concluded from the eom used here and it was previously concluded based on other techniques @xcite .",
    "thus , the minimal relaxation factor @xmath89^{1/4}+b)$ ] is chosen such that it does not alter the exactly known @xmath58 term .",
    "together with the fact that only even powers in time and in @xmath39 can occur leads to the use of the unusual exponent of @xmath90 .    based on we fit the eom data and determine @xmath57 and @xmath63 in this way .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : param ] for smaller values of @xmath39 , i.e. , on the left side of the dashed vertical lines .",
    "we are aware that the decay rate @xmath57 and the crossover time @xmath91 ensuing from this analysis are only estimates in view of the hypothesis necessary to analyze the data .",
    "the decay rate @xmath57 increases only weakly for increasing @xmath39 ; our data is consistent with @xmath92 as it is built - in into the fit function .",
    "the @xmath68 dependence is taken into account by the factor @xmath87 .",
    "our analysis is not unbiased , but relies on certain assumptions .",
    "we emphasize that this is also the case in many other approaches on relaxation which rely on a probabilistic description which has relaxation built - in by construction , see for instance @xcite .    except for a fairly narrow window between @xmath93 and @xmath94 the eom data",
    "allows us to decide whether a strong quench with oscillatory behavior ( eq .  ) occurs or whether a weak quench displaying only some shoulders or wiggles occurs ( eq .  ) .",
    "the existence of these two qualitative different regimes , separated by a dynamic transition is obvious .",
    "this 2d result is in line with previous observations in @xmath0d @xcite , in gutzwiller approximation @xcite , and in 1d @xcite .",
    "the relaxation as captured by @xmath57 , see fig .  [",
    "fig : param ] , is by far largest in the vicinity of the dynamic transition , i.e. , around @xmath95 . in this region ,",
    "the rate is of the order of the band width .",
    "but away from this region , i.e. , for small or for large interaction the relaxation is very weak . for low @xmath39",
    "this is expected as explained above since the leading order @xmath68 does not lead to relaxation so that only the next - leading @xmath96 processes induce relaxation .    for strong values of @xmath39",
    "it is remarkable that the relaxation becomes small again .",
    "we attribute this fascinating behavior to the dominance of the local rabi oscillations @xcite with @xmath97 , see dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : param ] .",
    "these oscillations do not relax at all for @xmath98 so that the conclusion @xmath99 suggests itself .",
    "the fits shown in fig .  [ fig : param ] are consistent with this argument , but they are not particularly stable .",
    "concluding , we studied interaction quenches in the 2d hubbard model as a generic finite dimensional model between one and infinite dimension . the momentum distribution is computed and for strong interactions collapse - and - revival oscillations of the singular jump in the momentum distribution at the fermi surface is found . though qualitatively similar to what has been measured in bosonic systems , the key difference is that the bosonic collapse - and - revival occurs at a single point , the center , in the brillouin zone . for weak interactions ,",
    "only very weak oscillations occur so that two qualitatively distinct regimes are found , separated by a dynamic transition .",
    "considering the fermi jump in the momentum distribution as particularly sensitive probe we have found that it decreases much faster in two dimensions than in one dimension .",
    "this provides evidence for relaxation without the bias of a probabilistic ansatz in terms of a density matrix .",
    "in particular for intermediate interactions @xmath100 a significant relaxation rate of the order of the band width was found .",
    "based on plausible , though not rigorous assumptions , on the functional form of the relaxation we estimated the decay rates in the two - dimensional hubbard model at half - filling .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : param ] .    by a nonequilibrium extension of dynamic cluster theory tsuji and co",
    "- workers have also obtained results for quenches in the two - dimensional hubbard model @xcite .",
    "since they are using iterated perturbation theory they focus on weak quenches ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "one of their central issues is the differing relaxation rate at different points on the fermi surface .",
    "a quantitative comparison to our approach shows that their data is close to what we obtain within the exponentiated perturbative result in eq .  .",
    "but the differences for times up to @xmath102 between their results and the reliable results of the equation of motion are larger than the differences between the results for @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "thus we consider it difficult to draw definite conclusions on this issue at the present stage .",
    "the approach as it is presented here makes contributions to nonequilibrium dynamics up to intermediate times .",
    "moreover , it can contribute to the theoretically fascinating , but intricate , issue what happens at long times by gauging other techniques .",
    "in particular , no assumption has been made that the evolution of the system can be described by a statistical mixture even though one starts from a pure state .",
    "furthermore , we stress that the approach as it stands has the potential to provide experimentally relevant data .",
    "often , experimental data is also restricted to short and intermediate times due to various disturbing effects whose detrimental influence grows in relative importance with time .",
    "the quenches studied in the present article started from a non - interacting fermi sea as an initial state which can be treated according to wick s theorem .",
    "but it must be emphasized that this property is not essential for the approach used .",
    "the indispensable prerequisite is to know the correlations of the initial state in order that the equation of motion technique can be put to use .",
    "thus , many different initial states can indeed be treated .",
    "also mixtures , for instance the thermal density operator at a certain temperature @xmath103 , can be used to analyse the final result of the equations of motion .    beyond short and intermediate times",
    ", the employed technique can be iterated over many short time intervals to reach long times .",
    "the key idea is to assume that a probabilistic description holds after each short time interval so that one can re - initialize the eom approach after each time step . by comparison to the direct results by eom",
    ", one can investigate to which extent the assumption that the system is describable as a mixture holds .",
    "if satisfying agreement is found one can then use the approach of iterated time steps to reach much longer times .",
    "even the properties of stationary states can be tackled , that is , the steady - state that describes the system after infinite long time .",
    "this steady - state can be addressed by equations of motion if they are combined with the concept of stationary phases , see for instance ref .  .",
    "in this way , the way is paved for the further methodological developments which help us to better understand nonequilibrium physics ."
