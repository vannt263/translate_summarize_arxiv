    "the nearby low - luminosity ( fr i ) radio galaxy ngc 4261 ( 3c270 ) is a good candidate for the detection of free - free absorption by ionized gas in an inner accretion disk . the galaxy is known to contain a central black hole with a mass of @xmath4 @xcite , a nearly edge - on nuclear disk of gas and dust with a diameter of @xmath5 pc , and a large - scale symmetric radio structure which implies that the radio axis is close to the plane of the sky . @xcite gives a distance of @xmath6 mpc , or 40 mpc for an assumed hubble constant of @xmath7 . at a distance of 40 mpc",
    ", 1 milliarcsecond ( mas ) corresponds to 0.2 pc .",
    "previous vlba observations of this galaxy revealed a parsec - scale radio jet and counterjet aligned with the kpc - scale jet ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ; @xcite ) .",
    "we believe the west - pointing jet is oriented slightly towards us ( so the east - pointing jet is labeled the counterjet ) based on the orientation of the dust disk imaged by hst and the fact that the west - pointing kpc - scale jet is slightly brighter over most of its length in vla images ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the opening angle of the jets is less than @xmath8 during the first 0.2 pc and less than @xmath9 during the first 0.8 pc .",
    "at 8.4 ghz we found evidence for a narrow gap in radio brightness at the base of the parsec - scale counterjet , just east ( left ) of the brightest peak which we identified as the core based on its inverted spectrum between 1.6 and 8.4 ghz @xcite .",
    "we tentatively identified this gap as the signature of free - free absorption by a nearly - edge on inner disk with a width much less than @xmath10 pc and an average electron density of @xmath11 over the inner 0.1 pc .",
    "the region labeled  gap \" in figure  [ fig1 ] differs from other regions of reduced emission along the counterjet in two ways .",
    "first , it is uniquely deep and narrow .",
    "this is difficult to see in the contour maps ( figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig7 ] ) , but is clear in the brightness profiles ( figures  [ fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] ) .",
    "second , the  gap \" region has a strongly inverted radio spectrum , as shown in figure  [ fig9 ] .",
    "this is completely different from the spectrum anywhere else along the jet or counterjet . for these reasons",
    "we believe that the gap labeled in figure  [ fig1 ] is not an intrinsically faint part of the counterjet but instead is faint because of intervening absorption .",
    "we observed ngc 4261 at 1.6 and 4.9 ghz with the halca satellite and a ground array composed of 7 vlba antennas plus the 25-m antenna at shanghai , china , the 34-m antenna at kashima , japan , and the nasa deep space network 70-m antenna at tidbinbilla , australia , at 1.6 ghz ( 22 june 1999 ) and 8 vlba antennas plus the phased 27 antennas of the vla at 4.9 ghz ( 27 june 1999 ) .",
    "halca is an 8-m diameter antenna in earth orbit , which is used in combination with ground antennas by the vsop project @xcite . during both epochs the vlba antennas at st .",
    "croix and hancock were unavailable , as was the north liberty antenna during the 1.6 ghz session .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] lists the antennas involved at each frequency .",
    "data were recorded as two 16-mhz bandwidth channels with 2-bit sampling by the mark - iii / vlba systems and correlated at the vlba processor in socorro . at 1.6 ghz we recorded 1.634 - 1.666 ghz , and at 4.9 ghz we recorded 4.850 - 4.882 ghz .",
    "both channels were sensitive to left circular polarization .",
    "the correlator produced a total of 32 spectral channels with an averaging time of 1 second to minimize time smearing of visibility measurements on the ground - space baselines .",
    ".antennas used at 1.6 and 4.9 ghz [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     therefore our choice of disk opening angle can change the line - of - sight path lengths through the disk by factors of 17 , 22 , and 26 at 1.6 , 4.9 , and 8.4 ghz .",
    "however , for a given observed optical depth the average electron density depends on @xmath12 , so our derived values of @xmath13 will vary only by factors of 4 or 5 if we assume different disk opening angles .",
    "it is quite possible that the central region of this low - luminosity radio galaxy contains an advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) .",
    "however , because we observe a thin disk down to a radius of 0.2 pc ( @xmath14 schwarzschild radii ) , we conclude that the transition radius between the outer thin disk and an inner adaf must be smaller than this value .",
    "this is a useful constraint ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) and is consistent with the upper limit for adaf size of @xmath5 schwarzschild radii in ngc 4258 @xcite .",
    "of course , the relatively cool thin disk could contain a non - standard , hot , advection - dominated corona ; our observations would not have been sensitive to it .",
    "if we combine the disk opening angle of @xmath15 from @xcite with the disk orientation angle of @xmath16 from @xcite and @xcite we find that the line of sight through the disk is @xmath17 }   \\approx 1.3\\,x$ ] , where @xmath18 is the projected distance on the sky between the center of the disk ( core ) and the line of sight ( see figure  [ fig10 ] ) . from figures  [ fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] we see that the location of the absorption ( gap ) is about 1.2 mas from the peak at 4.9 ghz and 1.1 mas from the peak at 8.4 ghz .",
    "an angular distance of 1.2 mas ( 0.24 pc ) between the core and the center of the absorption gives a total path length through the disk of 0.31 pc . for @xmath19 mas ( 0.22 pc ) , the line - of - sight path length @xmath20 pc .",
    "these are sufficiently close that we will assume equal path lengths at both frequencies .",
    "we would like to determine the radial distribution of electron density in the accretion disk , but this requires measurement of the optical depth along multiple paths that pass through the disk at different radii .",
    "the absorption we see at 4.9 and 8.4 ghz occurs in nearly the same narrow region . at 1.6 ghz",
    "the absorption is presumably larger , but the absorbed region is only partially resolved with our angular resolution so we have only a lower limit for the optical depth . a more sensitive 1.6 ghz experiment ( that might allow fringes to halca to be detected ) or a global vlbi experiment at 2.3 ghz could help .",
    "however , the nearly edge - on orientation of the inner disk makes any determination of spatial variations in optical depth difficult .    assuming an intrinsic spectral index of @xmath21 and a covering factor of unity , the observed brightness ratio at two frequencies @xmath22 and @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 .",
    "the apparent reduction in brightness is about a factor of 30 at 4.9 ghz and a factor of 4 at 8.4 ghz .",
    "this implies that @xmath25 and @xmath26 , so @xmath27 . as a check on the plausibility of these values",
    ", we note that a brightness ratio of 7.5 between 8.4 and 4.9 ghz implies that @xmath28 \\approx 2.2 $ ] .",
    "the spectral index @xmath29 comes from @xcite .",
    "the prediction of this simple formula for @xmath30 (= 2.2 ) is in reasonable agreement with the measured value of 2.0 , considering that we have not taken into account the ( small ) difference in path length through the disk at the two frequencies .",
    "the free - free optical depth is given by @xcite as    @xmath31\\ ] ]    where the path length @xmath32 is in cm ( not pc as in @xcite ; see @xcite ) , @xmath33 is in electrons @xmath2 , @xmath34 is in k , and @xmath35 is in hz .",
    "astrophysical plasmas undergoing sufficient heating to stay ionized generally occupy one of two phases : a very hot phase that fills the local space at roughly the virial temperature or a warm phase at about @xmath36k .",
    "( under ambient conditions , the latter phase maintains pressure balance with the former phase , but in a black hole accretion disk situation the cooler gas will collect in a keplerian disk whose pressure and density are determined by the black hole s tidal forces . )",
    "the virial temperature at @xmath37 pc from a @xmath38 black hole is nearly @xmath39 k , producing a very tenuous , spherical plasma with little free - free absorption , rather than a thin disk with substantial absorption . a spherical ,",
    "low - absorption plasma is inconsistent with our detection of narrow , deep absorption features .",
    "we therefore choose the warm , efficiently - radiating @xmath36 k accretion phase , for which we have developed a simple model in @xcite . in this case",
    "the gaunt factor ( in square brackets above ) for gas within the disk is approximately 9 at both 4.9 and 8.4 ghz .",
    "we now have estimates for @xmath40 , and can calculate the average @xmath33 along the line of sight for each value of @xmath35 :    @xmath41    at @xmath42 hz , we have @xmath43 and @xmath44 cm . adding the assumption of @xmath45",
    "gives us @xmath46 @xmath2 . at 8.4 ghz",
    "we get @xmath47 @xmath2 .",
    "given the uncertainties in the optical depths and path lengths , these values for @xmath33 are not significantly different .",
    "these values are consistent with the electron densities derived by @xcite based on lower resolution images .",
    "note that if the thinner model disk from @xcite is used the average electron densities would be only 4 - 5 times higher . in all cases",
    "a shorter path length or higher gas temperature would increase the average @xmath33 .",
    "the electron densities derived here are low enough that thompson scattering should not be a significant source of additional absorption .",
    "the thompson scattering coefficient per free electron is @xmath48 , so a column density of @xmath49 electrons @xmath50 gives us an absorption of only @xmath51 due to thompson scattering .",
    "the plasma oscillation frequency is given by @xmath52 hz , which is @xmath53 mhz for @xmath54 .",
    "this is a factor of @xmath55 below our observing frequencies and therefore we expect refraction or reflection of radiation within the disk plasma to be negligible .",
    "our result can be compared with that obtained by @xcite for 3c84 .",
    "these authors find @xmath56 for a 1 pc path length , assuming @xmath57 k. we find very similar average electron densities for the inner pc of the disk in ngc 4261 , whose low frequency radio luminosity is about 7 times smaller than for 3c84 @xcite , suggesting that the density of plasma in accretion disks does not depend strongly on the radio luminosity of the central engine .",
    "it should be noted that very small or very large optical depths are difficult to measure accurately , and if typical path lengths through the ionized absorbing medium are similar in different galaxies this observational selection effect will bias the distribution of derived electron densities toward similar values . in any case , a larger number of sources covering a larger range of radio luminosities will need to be compared in this way before firm conclusions can be made .",
    "if the accretion - generated luminosity is less than @xmath58 times the eddington luminosiity , there will be no radiation - pressure dominated region in the accretion disk ( @xcite ; @xcite )",
    ". this may be the case in ngc 4261 , whose nuclear luminosity is quite small for an active galaxy .",
    "if this is the case , the average magnetic field @xmath59 in the disk can be estimated by assuming pressure balance between the magnetic field and the thermal disk gas : @xmath60 , where here @xmath61 is the @xcite viscosity parameter and @xmath62 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "for @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 we get @xmath66 gauss .",
    "this applies at disk radii near 0.2 pc .",
    "there is considerable uncertainty in these parameter values , particularly in the assumed value of @xmath61 .",
    "we can calculate the expected rotation measure from @xmath67 , where @xmath32 is the path length ( still in cm ) and @xmath59 is the parallel component of the magnetic field . using the magnetic field and electron density derived above we get rotation measures of about @xmath68 radians m@xmath69 at 4.8 ghz and @xmath70 radians m@xmath69 at 8.4 ghz .",
    "these are actually upper limits because they assume that the magnetic field is ordered and parallel to our line of sight , which is unlikely .",
    "in fact , shear created by differential rotation within the accretion disk may cause the magnetic field to be aligned along the direction of gas rotation .",
    "this would mean that the magnetic field was mainly orthogonal to our line of sight as it passes through the disk , and , consequently , the observed rotation measure would be greatly reduced .",
    "future vlbi polarization observations may be able to directly measure the faraday rotation and resulting depolarization in front of the radio counterjet .",
    "our new observations at 1.6 and 4.9 ghz confirm the free - free absorption explanation for the sub - parsec radio morphology in ngc 4261 , specifically the fact that the gap in emission at the base of the counterjet is caused by shadowing of the counterjet by the accretion disk .",
    "measurements of the angular width and optical depth in the absorbed region , and the distance between the absorption and the core , as a function of frequency show that the inner pc of the accretion disk is geometrically thin and that the average electron density is a few times @xmath71 at a deprojected radius of 0.2 pc .",
    "the corresponding equipartition magnetic field strength is about @xmath3 g. similar observations of other galaxies covering a wide range of radio luminosities will allow correlations between the central engine fueling process ( accretion disk geometry , density , mass , and magnetic field ) and agn activity level ( nonthermal luminosity ) to be studied .",
    "such studies should improve our understanding of the physical processes involved in accretion - powered central engines in galactic nuclei .",
