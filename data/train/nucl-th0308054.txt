    "an ideal asymmetry should thus fulfill three criteria : it should be large to give a good experimental signal , it should show sensitivity on the structure amplitudes , and it should allow a differentiation between the pion cloud and @xmath8 resonance contributions in resonant channels , revealing as much as possible about the role of at least these low energy degrees of freedom in the nucleon . in sect .

    "[ sseindievertasyn ] and [ sseindievertdiffn ] , @xmath100 exhibits of all asymmmetries by far the largest sensitivity on the spin polarizabilities .",
    "therefore , an experiment with the nucleon spin aligned perpendicular to the photon momentum seems from the theorist s point of view to be the most promising of the considered configurations to extract the spin polarizabilities .",
    "the weakest dependence on the @xmath70 s at low energies of @xmath100 occurs in extreme forward direction .",
    "this again can be explained looking at @xmath41 and @xmath65 ( fig .",
    "[ a1a3 ] ) : in the backward direction , @xmath113 and therefore also @xmath114 , giving a much larger absolute value when spins are included . in the forward direction , @xmath65 differs weakly from @xmath97 for @xmath115 mev , so that spin polarizability effects appear only for higher energies .    as in @xmath88 ,",
    "the quadrupole polarizabilities in @xmath100 are negligibly small ( fig .",
    "[ sseindievertasyn ] ) .",
    "one observes the strongest contributions around @xmath116 ; a simple answer to this phenomenon can not be given , albeit it is clear that @xmath100 should be most sensitive at a scattering angle around @xmath54 , as the overall factor @xmath117 reaches its maximum ( eq .  (",
    "[ eq : rightleft ] ) ) , but this is a general feature and not only concerning the quadrupole polarizabilities .",
    "so as a short conclusion of sects .",
    "[ sec : proton ] and [ sec : neutron ] we find a much stronger sensitivity of the neutron asymmetries on the nucleon structure , while the proton asymmetries are dominated by pole terms up to at least @xmath118 mev .",
    "contributions of the @xmath1 resonance are crucial only for certain asymmetries and angles .",
    "for both nucleons , the spin configuration @xmath31 turned out to be more sensitive on the nucleon spin structure than @xmath119 .",
    "dynamical quadrupole contributions are negligible in each of the considered cases .",
    "[ sec : con ]    in this work , we examined spin - averaged and double polarized nucleon compton cross sections in the framework of chiral effective field theory as a guideline for future experiments .",
    "our goal was to identify those experimental settings which are most likely to be sensitive to the four leading spin polarizabilities of the proton and neutron .",
    "these quantities parameterize the stiffness of the nucleon spin against electro - magnetically induced deformations of definite multipolarity and non - zero frequency .",
    "their energy dependence gives profound insight into the dispersive behavior of the internal degrees of freedom of the nucleon , caused by internal relaxation effects , baryonic resonances and mesonic production thresholds , see also @xcite for details .    in the spin - averaged cross sections , sect .",
    "[ spinav ] , we found significant deviations between predictions with and without spin polarizabilities",
    ". therefore , spin - averaged experiments can contribute to a direct determination of _ dynamical spin _ polarizabilities from data , too .    in the polarized case , sects .",
    "[ sec : proton ] and  [ sec : neutron ] , we considered configurations with a right - circularly polarized incident photon and a polarized target nucleon , leaving the spins of the particles in the final state undetected .",
    "we investigated the dependence of the cross sections and asymmetries on the spin polarizabilities in two different spin configurations : ( i ) nucleon spin parallel minus antiparallel to the photon momentum , and ( ii ) perpendicular to it but still inside the reaction plane .",
    "we noted a stronger sensitivity in the asymmetry @xmath31 of configuration ( ii ) for both proton and neutron targets , than in case ( i ) .",
    "we found furthermore that only two of the structure amplitudes , namely @xmath41 and @xmath65 , dominate all cross sections and asymmetries .",
    "the spin polarizabilities give usually the clearest signal for photon energies above 100 mev , say around the pion production threshold ( @xmath120  mev ) , where most of the asymmetries also reach @xmath121 .",
    "in backward direction , the neutron asymmetries also show a strong sensitivity on the physics of the @xmath1 resonance , in addition to contributions from the chiral pion cloud around the nucleon .    in general ,",
    "the neutron asymmetries were found to be more sensitive to the spin polarizabilities than the proton analogs .",
    "this is no surprise , since compton scattering on the charged proton is dominated by the pole amplitudes . besides the resulting minor sensitivity on the nucleon structure , another disadvantage of the proton asymmetries is the small spin - averaged cross section around the pion production threshold for small angles , which enhances theoretical uncertainties .",
    "again , we emphasize that up to leading - one - loop order the only difference between proton and neutron is given by the pole contributions , i.e.  the structure part of our amplitudes is the one of an isoscalar nucleon .",
    "polarized cross sections , which are calculated in this approximation , might therefore deviate from experimental results , especially for the neutron , where the pole contributions are weak .",
    "hints on important isovector contributions are given in @xcite , where the non - pion - pole contribution to the backward spin polarizability @xmath71 of the neutron was found about twice as large as the corresponding proton value .",
    "contributions of the quadrupole polarizabilities turned out to be negligibly small , as in the spin - averaged case @xcite . therefore ,",
    "like spin - averaged observables , spin - polarized cross sections are well described by only six energy - dependent functions : the two spin - independent and four spin dipole polarizabilities .",
    "this lead us in sect .",
    "[ strucamp ] to propose to extract the energy dependence of the four spin polarizabilities of the individual nucleons by a model - independent multipole expansion of the structure amplitudes from a combination of polarized and unpolaried precision experiments .",
    "chiral effective field theory with explicit @xmath1 degrees of freedom represents correctly the symmetries and low energy degrees of freedom inside the nucleon in a model - independent way .",
    "one can therefore in a first step accept our predictions of the energy dependence of the polarizabilities as induced by dispersive effects and only fit their overall normalization to experiment , thus obtaining their static values . at present , only two linear combinations , @xmath122 and @xmath71 , were measured exerimentally on the proton at legs  @xcite and mami  @xcite , with partially conflicting values .",
    "clearly , the lack of free neutron targets makes an extension of the work presented here to light nuclei mandatory if experiments are to be interpreted , especially in the light of feasibility studies on compton scattering on the deuteron and @xmath123he at hi@xmath16s / tunl @xcite .",
    "work is therefore under way to consider spin polarized observables on these configurations , systematically including all binding and pion exchange current effects in an extension of chiral effective field theory to light nuclei @xcite .",
    "further investigations involving linearly polarized photon beams are also in preparation @xcite .",
    "we are therefore confident that such future experiments will further our understanding of a fundamental property of the nucleon : the response of its effective low energy degrees of freedom , and in particular of its spin , in strong electric and magnetic fields , as parameterized in the dipole polarizabilities .",
