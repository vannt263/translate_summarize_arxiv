    "ultra - metal - poor ( ump ) stars serve a critical role for understanding the initial epochs of our galaxy ; the observed abundances in these very old stars provide clues to the nucleosynthetic processes in the earliest galactic stellar generations .",
    "the ump halo giant 22892  ( [ fe / h ] = 3.1  @xmath5  log@xmath6(n@xmath7/n@xmath8)@xmath9   log@xmath10(n@xmath7/n@xmath8)@xmath11 , and log  @xmath12(a )  @xmath5  log@xmath6(n@xmath7/n@xmath13 )  +  12.0 , for elements a and b. ump stars are considered to be those with [ fe / h ]  @xmath1  2.5 . ] ) merits special attention in nucleosynthesis studies .",
    "this star has extremely large overabundances of neutron - capture ( n - capture ) elements relative to iron , and the abundances of those elements with z  @xmath2  56 apparently are consistent only with a scaled solar system r[apid]-process abundance distribution ( sneden  1996 ; cowan  1999 ; norris , ryan , & beers 1997 ; pfeiffer , kratz & thielemann 1997 ) . in addition",
    ", this is the first star for which thorium and an extensive number of n - capture elements have been detected , allowing an estimation of its radioactive age ( sneden  1996 ; cowan  1997 , 1999 ; pfeiffer  1997 ) .",
    "thus far , two n - capture element domains in 22892  and other ump stars have been largely unexplored : the region 40  @xmath1  z  @xmath1  56 ( between zr and ba ) ; and the region 75  @xmath1  z  @xmath1  83 ( the 3@xmath14 n - capture peak peak , os@xmath15pb ) .",
    "using extensive new high resolution spectroscopic data , we have derived a new model - atmosphere for 22892 , and derived abundances for a set of n - capture elements never before seen in this ( or any other ump ) star .",
    "these new abundances and their implications for early galactic nucleosynthesis of n - capture elements are discussed in this _",
    "two new high resolution , high s / n spectra of 22892  were obtained .",
    "the keck  i hires ( vogt  1994 ) was used for one night in august , 1998 to obtain a spectrum ( the sum of multiple individual integrations ) in the near - uv region , 3200  @xmath16  @xmath17  @xmath16  4250   .",
    "the resolving power was r  @xmath5  @xmath18  @xmath3  45,000 , and the s / n varied smoothly from @xmath1930 near to @xmath20200 near .",
    "we also used the mcdonald 2.7 m smith telescope and 2d - coud echelle spectrograph ( tull  1995 ) for three nights in october , 1998 to obtain a high resolution ( r  @xmath3  60,000 ) spectrum , also the sum of multiple exposures , at longer wavelengths ( 4400  @xmath16  @xmath17  @xmath16  8000   ) .",
    "again , the s / n varied with wavelength , from @xmath1950 near to @xmath20150 near .",
    "accompanying both hires and 2d - coud observations of 22892were standard auxiliary integrations on tungsten filament and th - ar hollow cathode lamps .",
    "for the 2d - coud data , observations of hot , rapidly rotating ( essentially featureless ) stars of similar airmass to 22892were obtained to facilitate removal of telluric spectral features in the longer wavelength spectral regions .",
    "standard echelle reduction techniques were used to produce the final spectra .",
    "we determined new model atmosphere parameters for 22892from an analysis of equivalent widths ( mostly from uncrowded longer wavelength spectral regions ) of nearly 200 transitions of lighter ( z  @xmath21  30 ) elements .",
    "this analysis applied the usual conditions that demand agreement between abundances from low- and high - excitation lines and from weak and strong lines of a given species , and agreement between neutral and ionized species abundances .",
    "we interpolated model atmospheres from the kurucz ( 1999 ) grid , and employed the current version of sneden s ( 1973 ) line analysis code .",
    "the derived model has  =  4710  k , log  g  = 1.50 , v@xmath22  =  2.1  , and model metallicity [ m / h ]  =  3.2 .",
    "these values are in good agreement with the parameters ( 4760  k , 1.30 , 2.3  , 3.1 ) determined previously by mcwilliam  ( 1995 ) from lower resolution , lower s / n spectra .",
    "our new abundances for the z  @xmath21  30 elements also agree well with those of mcwilliam , but with greatly reduced line - to - line scatter .    with the new model atmosphere , abundances for n - capture elements were determined from equivalent width and synthetic spectrum analyses .",
    "the analysis techniques are described in detail by sneden  ( 1996 ) .",
    "table  1 gives the new abundances and their single - line standard deviation values , as well as abundances that were determined by sneden .",
    "we first analyzed some n - capture elements ( y , zr , nd , sm , eu , gd , dy , er , tm , and yb ) previously treated by sneden .",
    "these elements have large numbers of transitions in the near - uv ( @xmath17  @xmath1 4000   ) .",
    "the new analyses used the enlarged spectral coverage of our new 22892  data and the most recent oscillator strength information in greatly expanding the line lists for these elements .",
    "the reliability of the abundances increased , as indicated by lower @xmath23 values for most of the re - analyzed elements .",
    "the new abundances are in good accord with those of sneden . moreover , there are no discernible abundance trends for individual n - capture element species with wavelength , suggesting that the model atmosphere and line analysis techniques consistently reproduce the observed 22892  spectrum from the red to the near - uv spectral regions .",
    "we then searched the spectra for transitions of n - capture elements not previously detected in ump ( or in fact , in most ) stars .",
    "this yielded detections of six light n - capture elements ( nb , ru , rh , pd , ag , and cd ) . additionally , some elements of the 3@xmath14 n - capture peak ( os , ir , and pb ) were identified ; of this group only os had previously been tentatively detected by sneden  ( 1996 ) .",
    "we derived abundances for these elements via synthetic spectrum computations , since their transitions lie mainly in the crowded near - uv spectral region .",
    "for illustration , in figure  1 we present the observed and synthetic spectra of lines for three of the elements .",
    "these transitions and other new ones were easily identified even in the lowest wavelength spectral regions . in table  1",
    "we list the abundances of these newly identified elements .",
    "note that nb , ru , and cd have only one transition so far identified on our spectra .",
    "the ( relatively large ) @xmath23 values for these elements represent conservative estimates from assessment of transition probability information , continuum placement , identification of blending spectral features , and synthetic spectrum fits .    finally , we considered the radioactive chronometer elements thorium and uranium .",
    "we detected a new line at , and analyzed that line in conjunction with the usually - employed line .",
    "the abundances from these two transitions are in excellent agreement , and are very similar to the th abundance determined by sneden  ( 1996 ) .",
    "we did not find any features of , but derived an upper limit to the u abundance from an estimate of the maximum strength of the un - detected feature .",
    "in the top panel of figure  2 we plot the 22892  n - capture abundances from this study , and those of sneden  ( 1996 ) for elements not analyzed by us . a scaled solar system r - process elemental abundance distribution is also shown .",
    "the solar distribution is obtained by a decomposition of the solar system elemental abundances ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) into s[low]- and r - process contributions to individual isotopes , and is based upon the measured isotopic n - capture cross sections ( kppeler  1989 , wisshak  1996 ) .",
    "summation of those contributions produces a solar system r - process _",
    "elemental _ abundance curve ; see burris  ( 2000 ) for details of this procedure .",
    "the solar system curve has been shifted to match the mean abundance level of the heavier n - capture elements ( 56  @xmath21  z  @xmath21  72 ) in 22892 .",
    "the mean difference is @xmath1log  @xmath24    log  @xmath25  = 1.41  @xmath4  0.02 ( @xmath23  =  0.08 , 15 elements ) .",
    "the small scatter about the mean value confirms and extends all previous studies that have found consistency between 22892  heavy n - capture element abundances and the solar system r - process distribution . in the bottom panel of figure  2",
    "this agreement is shown via a plot of the differences @xmath26(log  @xmath27 ) between the 22892  abundances and the scaled solar curve .",
    "abundances of the 3@xmath28 n - capture peak elements os , ir , and pb are also in good agreement with the scaled solar system r - process distribution . abundances of 3@xmath28 peak elements in two other ump stars ( , sneden  1998 ) have anticipated this result , but these are the first reliable 3@xmath28 peak abundances in 22892 .",
    "thus the solar r - process pattern extends throughout the 56  @xmath21  z  @xmath21  82 element domain in this star .",
    "a nearly identical abundance distribution is observed in the ump star hd 115444 ( westin  2000 ) .",
    "in addition , the [ ba / eu ] ratio in most ump stars is in accord with the solar r - process value ( , mcwilliam 1998 , burris  2000 ) .",
    "the agreement of all of these abundance patterns with the solar system r - process distribution suggests a uniform site , and/or uniform conditions for synthesis of the heavier n - capture elements .",
    "the thorium abundance of 22892  lies below the solar r - process curve in figure  2 , indicating that radioactive decay of this element has taken place over the time since it was created by the progenitor of this star .",
    "we computed a th - based radioactive age for 22892with various input assumptions ( such as using both theoretical r - process predictions and the observed solar system abundances ) .",
    "the calculations are sensitive to small parameter changes and give a range of results with a average of @xmath3  16  gyr .",
    "the error bars on the derived age , including both observational and theoretical uncertainties , are @xmath3  4  gyr . an age estimate for 22892  from the upper limit on the uranium abundance",
    "can be done by comparing this limit with predictions ( cowan  1999 ) for the long - lived uranium @xmath29u isotope ( _ i.e. _ , assuming that we are not observing any of the relatively quickly decaying @xmath30u isotope ) .",
    "this yields a lower age limit of @xmath3 11  gyr for 22892 .",
    "while this limit is even more uncertain than values based upon the detection of th , it does provide a lower bound on the age of this star which , within the error uncertainty , is consistent with the age determination using the th chronometer .",
    "in contrast to the heavy stable elements , our observations clearly demonstrate that the agreement between 22892  and solar system r - process abundances fails for the lighter ( z  @xmath1  56 ) n - capture elements ( see figure  2 ) . for these nine elements , @xmath1log  @xmath24    log  @xmath25  = 1.72  @xmath4  0.07 ( @xmath23  =  0.20 ) .",
    "abundances of six of the lighter n - capture elements lie well below the solar system r - process curve that reproduces the heavier elements .",
    "the abundances of the odd - z light n - capture elements are substantially less than those of the even - z elements , a pattern typically seen in s - process nucleosynthesis .",
    "however , the scaled solar system s - process abundance distribution is a poor match to the 22892  lighter n - capture abundances .",
    "numerical experiments , analogous to those conducted by cowan  ( 1995 ) , suggest that a mix consisting of solar r - process abundances plus 10% of the solar s - process abundances can roughly fit the 22892  data .",
    "but the y and ag abundances of 22892  are 0.3 - 0.5  dex lower than this hybrid solar system distribution .",
    "in addition , the overall abundance level of these elements is still about 0.2  dex below the level of the heavier elements , when compared together to the solar distribution ( figure  2 ) .",
    "there does not appear to be a simple way to mix solar n - capture abundances to match those of 22892 .",
    "the existence of two distinct r - process signatures in solar system meteoritic material , one for n - capture nuclei lighter than mass number 140 and one for heavier nuclei , has been previously suggested by wasserburg , busso , & gallino ( 1996 ) , qian , vogel , & wasserburg ( 1998 ) .",
    "the clear differences between the abundances of the heavier and the lighter r - process elemental abundances in cs 22892052 are consistent with that suggestion .",
    "thus lighter and heavier nuclei possibly could be produced on different galactic timescales and come from supernovae of different mass ranges ( qian & wasserburg 2000 ) . alternatively , neutron - star binaries also could be a source for one of the mass ranges of r - process nuclei ( rosswog  1999 ) .",
    "the total n - capture 22892  abundance pattern is also consistent with a neutrino - heated supernova ejecta r - process in a single supernova event , albeit with two different epochs in the explosion / ejection process ( _ cf .",
    "_ , woosley  1994 , and references therein ) . in neutrino - heated ejecta nucleosynthesis models the abundance yields are extremely sensitive to the electron fraction in the shock re - heating epoch when the lighter r - process species are synthesized ( hoffman  1996 ) . the electron fraction and the resulting lighter r - process abundances in this early epoch are expected to be different for each supernova event . by contrast , the later neutrino - driven wind epoch , where the heavier r - process nuclides originate in these models , should have similar conditions , therefore producing the same abundance pattern , in all supernovae",
    "an additional clue about early galactic n - capture nucleosynthesis lies in the now well - documented very large star - to - star scatter in the bulk [ n - capture / fe ] ratios of ump stars ( , mcwilliam  1995 , burris  2000 ) . in 22892  for example , [ eu / fe ]  @xmath19  + 1.6 ( sneden  1996 ) , while other ump stars have [ eu / fe ]  @xmath1  0 . the large scatter in overall n - capture element content is an indication of the chemical inhomogeneity of the galactic halo ; the galaxy was not well - mixed at very early epochs .",
    "possible explanations for the early scatter in the [ n - capture / fe ] ratio involve separating the iron and r - process production into different types of supernovae with an initial iron production from very massive stars ( wasserburg & qian 2000 ) .",
    "detailed abundance analyses of many very low metallicity stars , and more extensive theoretical r - process calculations will be needed to understand better the differences between the production of iron and the entire range of r - process elements in the earliest galactic stellar populations .",
    "we thank andy mcwilliam , george preston , jim truran , and craig wheeler for helpful discussions , and the referee , jerry wasserburg , for helping us to improve the paper .",
    "we are grateful to the staff of the keck observatory for their expert assistance with the observations .",
