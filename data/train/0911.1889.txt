    "experimental studies of charged cosmic rays ( crs ) are focused on the understanding of the acceleration mechanism of high - energy crs , identification of their sources , and clarification of their interactions with the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the origin of crs is still under debate , although direct measurements with instruments on stratospheric balloons or in space have provided information on their elemental composition and energy spectra , and indirect detection by ground - based experiments has extended the measurements up to the end of the observed all - particle spectrum .",
    "+ it is generally accepted that crs are accelerated in blast waves of supernova remnants ( snrs ) , which are the only galactic candidates known with sufficient energy output to sustain the cr flux @xcite .",
    "recent observation of emission of tev gamma - rays from snr rx j1713.7 - 3946 by the hess cherenkov telescope array proved that high - energy charged particles are accelerated in snr shocks up to energies beyond 100 tev @xcite .",
    "this result is consistent with expectations of the class of theoretical models that predict the existence of a rigidity - dependent limit , above which the diffusive shock acceleration becomes inefficient .",
    "the maximum energy attainable by a nucleus of charge @xmath6 may range from @xmath710@xmath8 ev to @xmath9 @xmath710@xmath10 ev depending on the model and types of supernovae considered @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the energy spectra of elements exhibit a @xmath6-dependent cutoff . as a consequence",
    ", the cr elemental composition is expected to change as a function of energy , marked by a depletion of low-@xmath6 nuclei in the several hundred tev region .",
    "this mechanism has been proposed as a possible explanation of the steepening ( `` knee '' ) in the cr energy spectrum ( described by a power law : @xmath11/@xmath12 ) with a change of the spectral index from @xmath132.7 to @xmath133.1 observed at energies around 4 pev .",
    "an alternative approach is adopted by models that relate the knee to leakage of crs from the galaxy . in this case , the knee is expected to occur at lower energies for light elements as compared to heavy nuclei , due to the rigidity - dependence of the larmor radius of cr particles propagating in the galactic magnetic field @xcite . + a detailed understanding of the propagation of crs during their wanderings inside the galaxy and their interactions with the ism is needed to infer the injection spectra of individual elements at the source from the observed spectra at earth .",
    "cr nuclei can be divided into primaries ( i.e. , h , he , c , o , fe , etc . ) that come from cr sources , and secondaries ( such as li , be , b , sc , ti , v , etc . ) , which are products of the interactions of primary nuclei with the ism .",
    "the amount of material traversed by crs between injection and observation can be derived from the measured ratio of secondary - to - primary nuclei , such as the boron - to - carbon ratio ( b / c ) or the ratio of sub - iron elements to iron .",
    "likewise , their confinement time in the galaxy can be determined through measurements of long - lived radioactive secondary nuclei @xcite .",
    "observations from space - based experiments like crn on the spacelab2 mission of the space shuttle @xcite and c2 @xcite and heavy nuclei experiment ( hne ) @xcite onboard the _ heao 3 _ satellite have shown that the energy spectra of the secondary nuclei are steeper than those of the primaries .",
    "the escape pathlength of crs from the galaxy depends on the magnetic rigidity as @xmath14 , with the parameter @xmath150.6 .",
    "this implies that the spectra observed at earth are steeper than the injection spectra , i.e. , the spectral index at the source is smaller by the value @xmath16 .",
    "+ those pioneering measurements were statistically limited at energies of order @xmath9 10@xmath17 ev .",
    "accurate direct measurements of the energy spectra of individual elements into the knee region are needed to discriminate between different astrophysical models proposed to explain the acceleration and propagation mechanisms .",
    "recently , a new generation of balloon - borne experiments has performed accurate measurements of crs in the previously experimentally unexplored tev region @xcite . among these , the cosmic ray energetics and mass ( cream ) experiment was designed to measure directly the elemental composition and the energy spectra of crs from hydrogen to iron over the energy range 10@xmath17 - 10@xmath18 ev in a series of flights @xcite . since 2004",
    ", four instruments were successfully flown on long - duration balloons in antarctica .",
    "the instrument configurations varied slightly in each mission due to various detector upgrades .",
    "the first flight produced important results extending the measurement of the relative abundances of cr secondary nuclei b and n close to the highest energies ( @xmath9 1.5 tev/@xmath2 ) allowed by the irreducible background generated by the residual atmospheric overburden at balloon altitudes .",
    "the data clearly indicate that the escape pathlength of crs from the galaxy has a power - law rigidity - dependence , with the parameter @xmath16 in the range 0.5 - 0.6 @xcite .",
    "in this work , we present new measurements of the energy spectra of the major primary cr nuclei from carbon to iron , up to a few tev/@xmath2 made with the second cream flight ( cream - ii ) . a new measurement of the nitrogen intensity with unprecedented statistics is also presented up to 800 gev/@xmath2 .",
    "the measured n / o ratio confirms the results of cream - i .",
    "the procedure used to analyze the data and reconstruct the cr energy spectra is described in detail together with an assessment of the systematic uncertainties . +",
    "the instrument for the second flight included : a redundant system for particle identification , consisting ( from top to bottom ) of a timing - charge detector ( tcd ) , a cherenkov detector ( cd ) , a pixelated silicon charge detector ( scd ) , and a sampling imaging calorimeter ( cal ) designed to provide a measurement of the energy of cr nuclei in the multi - tev region .",
    "figure [ cream2view ] depicts the detector arrangement .",
    "+ the tcd is made of two orthogonal layers of four 5 mm - thick plastic scintillator paddles each , covering an area of 120@xmath19120 @xmath20 .",
    "the paddles are read out by fast photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) via twisted - strip adiabatic light guides .",
    "a custom design of the electronics combines fast peak detection with a threshold timing measurement of the pmts signals in order to determine each element s charge with a resolution @xmath21 0.35 @xmath22 ( in units of the electron charge ) and to discriminate against albedo particles .",
    "a hodoscope ( s3 ) of 2@xmath192 mm@xmath23 square scintillating fibers read out by two pmts is located just above the calorimeter , and provides a reference time for tcd timing readout .",
    "further details about the tcd design and performance can be found in @xcite .",
    "the cd is a 1 cm - thick plastic radiator with 1 m@xmath23 surface area , instrumented with eight pmts viewing wavelength shifting bars placed along the radiator edges .",
    "it is used to flag relativistic particles and to provide a charge determination complementary to that of the tcd .",
    "+ the scd is comprised of two layers of 156 silicon sensors each .",
    "each 380 @xmath24m - thick sensor is segmented into an array of 4@xmath194 pixels , each of which has an active area of 2.12 @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the sensors are slightly tilted and overlap each other in both lateral directions , providing a full coverage in a single layer , with a 77.9 @xmath19 79.5 @xmath20 area .",
    "the dual layers , about 4 cm apart , cover an effective inner area of 0.52 m@xmath23 with no insensitive regions .",
    "the overall scd vertical dimension , including the ladders , the mechanical support structure and the electromagnetic shielding cover , is 97.5 mm @xcite .",
    "the readout electronics of the 4992 pixels is based on a 16-channel asic chip followed by 16-bit analog - to - digital converters ( adcs ) , providing a fine charge resolution over a wide dynamic range from hydrogen to nickel .",
    "+ the cal is a stack of 20 tungsten plates , each 1 radiation length ( @xmath25 ) thick and with surface area 50@xmath1950 @xmath26 , interleaved with active layers of 1 cm - wide and 50 cm - long scintillating - fiber ribbons .",
    "each ribbon is built by gluing together 19 scintillating fibers of 0.5 mm diameter each .",
    "the light signal from each ribbon is collected by means of an acrylic light mixer coupled to a bundle of 48 clear fibers .",
    "this is split into three sub - bundles ( with 42 , 5 and 1 fibers , respectively ) , each feeding a pixel of a hybrid photodiode ( hpd ) .",
    "this optical division is used to match the wide dynamic range of the calorimeter to that of the front - end electronics , providing three readout scales ( low , medium , and high ) with different sensitivity .",
    "a total of 2560 channels are readout from 40 hpds powered in groups of 5 units .",
    "+ the longitudinal and lateral segmentations of the cal correspond to 1 @xmath25 and 1 moliere radius , respectively .",
    "the ribbon planes are alternately oriented along orthogonal directions to image in three dimensions , the development of showers produced by the incoming nuclei which interact inelastically in the @xmath9 0.46 @xmath27-thick carbon target preceding the cal @xcite .",
    "the finely grained sampling calorimeter can track , by reconstructing the shower axis , the incident particle trajectory with enough accuracy to determine which segment of each charge detector it traversed , and thereby allowing discrimination against segments hit by the backscattered particles produced in the shower .",
    "this feature is essential for a reliable and unambiguous charge identification .",
    "the second cream instrument was launched from mcmurdo station in antarctica on 2005 december 16th .",
    "the balloon circled the south pole twice at a float altitude between 35 and 40 km .",
    "the flight was terminated on 2006 january 13th , 28 days after the launch . during the whole flight , the instrument housekeeping system monitored online temperatures , currents , voltages of the front - end electronics boards , and the high - voltage supply values of the hpds and pmts .",
    "the performance of all sub - detectors met the design technical specifications .",
    "the cal and tcd high - voltage systems worked successfully at low atmospheric pressure .",
    "the thermal behavior of the various detectors was found to be in good agreement with expectations from thermal models .",
    "the temperature of the instrument crates stayed within the required operational range with daily variation of a few @xmath28c , depending on the inclination of the sun during each 24 hr cycle .",
    "front - end electronics channels showed stable gains over the whole flight .",
    "pedestal values of the 2560 cal and 4992 scd channels were collected automatically every 5 minutes in order to monitor their drift as a function of the detector temperature and to perform accurate pedestal subtraction .",
    "1.7% of the scd and 0.7% of the cal channels were noisy or inefficient and were masked off .",
    "+ during the flight , the data acquisition was enabled whenever a shower developing in at least six planes was detected in the cal ( cal trigger ) and/or a relativistic cr with @xmath29 2 was identified by the tcd and cd ( tcd trigger ) . the high - energy data , i.e. , the cal triggered events , were transmitted via tracking and data relay satellite system ( tdrss ) , while the low - energy data , i.e. , events triggered only by the tcd and not by the cal , were recorded on an onboard disk .",
    "a total of 57 gb of data were collected . in order not to saturate the disk space too early in the flight ,",
    "the highly abundant low - energy particles triggered only by the tcd were prescaled , so that only a fraction of these events were recorded .",
    "this fraction of recorded tcd triggers ( prescale factor ) could be set by the data acquisition program and changed during the flight depending on the trigger rate . on average , only one every six tcd triggered events was retained .",
    "a detailed description of the instrument performance during the second flight may be found in @xcite .",
    "the present analysis uses a subset of data collected from december 19th to january 12th , under stable instrument conditions , representing a total of 24 days worth of data taking ( e.g. , removing periods early in the flight and at the very end , when the instrument was either being adjusted and optimized , or prepared for flight termination ) .",
    "the first step in the analysis is to correct the raw data for the gain variations among the channels and the drift of the pedestals with temperature .",
    "then the trajectory of each cr through the instrument is reconstructed and each event assigned a charge and an energy . at this point ,",
    "the events of each charge species are sorted into energy intervals and the number of counts in each bin is corrected for several effects in order to compute the differential intensity .",
    "the various steps of the analysis procedure are described in detail in the following subsections .      to determine the arrival direction of a cr",
    ", the axis of the shower imaged by the calorimeter is measured with the following method . in each cal plane , an offline software algorithm searches for clusters of adjacent cells with pulse heights larger than a threshold value , corresponding to an energy deposit of about 10 mev .",
    "the cluster formed by the cell with the maximum pulse height and its two neighbors defines a candidate track point .",
    "its coordinates are computed as the center of gravity of the cluster .",
    "a track is formed by matching at least three candidate track points sampled in each cal view .",
    "the shower axis parameters are calculated by a linear @xmath30 fit of the track .",
    "track quality is assured by requiring a value of @xmath3110 .",
    "the reconstructed shower axis is projected back to the top of the instrument in order to determine which scd pixels and tcd paddles were hit by the incoming cr .",
    "particles showering in the cal , but crossing neither the tcd scintillator paddles nor the scd planes are rejected .",
    "otherwise , if the particle crosses the scd , a circle of confusion with a 3 cm radius centered on the impact point of the track is traced in each scd layer .",
    "the value of the radius is equal to about three times the estimated uncertainty on the impact point .",
    "the hit pixels within each circle of confusion are scanned and the pixel with the maximum pulse height is selected for the charge assignment procedure . in order to improve the trajectory determination and the accuracy of the pathlength correction ,",
    "the two selected pixels , one per scd layer , are added to the candidate points and the track is fitted again . in this way , the intersection of the particle trajectory with the top scd layer is measured with a spatial resolution of 7 mm rms .",
    "the incidence direction is determined with an accuracy of better than 1@xmath32 as estimated with monte carlo ( mc ) simulations . +",
    "this procedure reconstructs well the trajectories of over 95% of the cr particles with energy @xmath33 3 tev triggered by the cal .",
    "it can also identify the tcd triggered events which produce a shower in the cal , but with an energy release insufficient to satisfy the cal trigger condition .",
    "the identification of the charge @xmath6 of a cr relies on two independent samples of its specific ionization @xmath34 provided by the scd layers .",
    "since @xmath34 depends on @xmath35 and for solid absorbers it is nearly constant in the relativistic regime , the particle charge @xmath6 can be determined by measuring the amount of ionization charge a cr produces when traversing the silicon sensors . in order to avoid charge misidentification of the incident nucleus , caused by the backscattered shower particles reaching the scd , and to obtain high - purity samples of cr elements , the signals , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , of the two pixels selected by the tracking algorithm",
    "are compared and required to be consistent within 20% .",
    "if this coherence cut is satisfied , they are corrected for the pathlength ( estimated from the track parameters ) traversed by the particle in the silicon sensors , which is proportional to @xmath38 , @xmath39 being the angle between the particle trajectory and the axis of the instrument . a reconstructed charge @xmath40 is assigned to the particle by combining the ionization signals matched with the track on both layers , according to the formula : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a calibration constant , inferred from the flight data , to convert the pulse heights into an absolute charge scale .",
    "the reconstructed charge distribution is shown in figure [ zfig ] . the elemental range from boron to silicon",
    "is fitted with a multi - gaussian function ( figure [ zfiga ] ) . from the fit",
    ", a charge resolution @xmath43 is estimated as : 0.2 @xmath22 for c , n , o and @xmath9 0.23 @xmath22 for ne , mg , si . though a multi - gaussian fit in the elemental region from sulfur to nickel can not be done due the limited statistics , the charge resolution for iron is estimated to be @xmath9 0.5 @xmath22 from the width of the fe peak .",
    "a 2@xmath43 cut around the mean charge value is applied to select samples of c , o , ne , mg and si . a cut of @xmath44 is imposed for fe due to the corresponding lower scd resolution , while for n a cut of @xmath45 and 10% coherence level between the selected pixels signals , are used to avoid contamination from more abundant adjacent charges .      due to the limitations on mass and size imposed to the payload , a balloon - borne experiment can not employ a total containment hadronic calorimeter to measure the energy of cr nuclei .",
    "an alternative and workable technique is to use a thin ionization calorimeter to sample the electromagnetic core of the hadronic cascade initiated by a cr interacting in a target preceding the calorimeter .",
    "in fact , though a significant part of the hadronic cascade energy leaks out of the calorimeter , the energy deposited in the calorimeter by the shower core still scales linearly with the incident particle energy , albeit with large event - to - event fluctuations . as a result , the energy resolution is poor by the standards of hadron calorimetry in experiments at accelerators .",
    "nevertheless , it is sufficient to reconstruct the steep energy spectra of cr nuclei with a nearly energy independent resolution .",
    "+ the cream calorimeter was designed to measure crs over a wide energy range , from tens of gev up to about 1 pev .",
    "it is characterized by a very small sampling fraction ; only about 0.1% of the cr energy is converted into visible signals in the cal active planes and collected by the photosensors .",
    "three different gain scales ( low , medium and high ) were implemented for each ribbon in order to prevent saturation of the readout electronics and thereby to ensure a linear detector response up to very high energies .",
    "+ the total energy deposited in the calorimeter by an interacting nucleus , is measured by summing up the corrected pulse heights of all the cells .",
    "the cells are equalized for non - uniformity in light output and gain differences among the photodetectors using a set of calibration constants from accelerator beam tests ( described below ) , scaled according to the high - voltage settings during the flight .",
    "low and medium gain scales are inter - calibrated using the flight data ; the medium - range signal of each ribbon is used whenever the corresponding low - range signal deviates from linearity due to saturation .",
    "the cream calorimeter was tested , equalized , and calibrated pre - flight at the cern sps accelerator with beams of electrons and protons up to a few hundred gev @xcite .",
    "its response to relativistic nuclei was also studied by exposing the calorimeter to nuclear fragments from a 158 gev/@xmath2 primary indium beam .",
    "the detector was found to have a linear response up to the maximum beam energy , equivalent to about 8.2 tev particle energy , and a nearly flat resolution ( around 30% ) , at energies above 1 tev for all heavy nuclei with z@xmath465 @xcite . above the maximum beam energy ,",
    "the calorimeter response was extrapolated using mc simulations , which predict a linear behavior up to hundreds of tev .      once each cr is assigned a charge and energy , the reconstructed particles of each nuclear species",
    "are sorted into energy intervals commensurate with the rms resolution of the calorimeter . due to the finite energy resolution of the detector ,",
    "the measured number of events in each energy bin must be corrected for overlap with the neighboring bins .",
    "this unfolding procedure requires solving a set of linear equations @xmath47 relating the `` true '' counts @xmath48 in one of @xmath2 incident energy bins to the measured counts @xmath49 in one of @xmath50 deposited energy bins .",

    "j _ , produces an energy deposit in the calorimeter falling into bin _",
    "i _ instead .",
    "a detailed mc simulation of the instrument , based on the fluka 2006.3b package @xcite , was developed to estimate the unfolding matrix .",
    "sets of nuclei , generated isotropically and with energies chosen according to a power - law spectrum , are analyzed with the same procedure used for the flight data .",
    "each matrix element @xmath51 is calculated by correlating the generated spectrum with the distribution of the deposited energy in the calorimeter @xcite . in order to get a reliable set of values of the unfolding matrix for each nucleus , the mc simulation",
    "is finely tuned to reproduce both flight data and the calibration data collected with accelerated particle beams .",
    "the agreement of the mc description with the real instrument behavior was carefully checked . as an example , in figure [ caledep ] the response of the calorimeter to carbon nuclei from the flight data is compared with an equivalent set of simulated events . + the elements of the unfolding matrix depend on the spectral index assumed for the generation of mc events . for each nucleus",
    "we used the spectral index value reported by @xcite , obtained by combining direct and indirect cr observations . in order to check the stability of our final results",
    ", the unfolding procedure was repeated by scanning several values of the spectral index in the range @xmath520.2 around the reference value .",
    "no significant bias of the final results was observed .",
    "crs may undergo spallation reactions when traveling through the atmosphere above the balloon or crossing the instrument material of cream above the scd .",
    "this results in the generation of secondary nuclei with lower charge than the parent s , and of about the same energy per nucleon .",
    "then , for each nuclear species , inelastic interactions lead to a loss of primary particles but also a gain of secondaries produced by heavier nuclei . for a correct determination of the cr fluxes",
    ", the data must be corrected for this effect .",
    "a two - step procedure is used which takes into account separately the cr pathlength in air ( correction to the top of the atmosphere ( toa ) ) and the amount of instrument material encountered by the particle before reaching the scd .",
    "the latter leads to a correction to the top of the instrument ( toi ) . for each step",

    "+ the second source of systematic errors comes from the uncertainties in the nucleus - nucleus charge - changing cross sections used to calculate the instrument and atmospheric corrections .",
    "while there is a general agreement between different parameterizations of the total cross sections , leading to very similar values of the survival fractions of crs in the atmosphere and in the instrument ( figures [ toi ] and [ toa ] ) , the partial charge - changing cross sections reported in the literature are measured with quoted errors of order 10%-15% , depending on the specific nucleus - nucleus interaction , and can differ by up to @xmath8330% .",
    "this may result in significantly different values of the off - diagonal elements @xmath58 in the transport matrix .",
    "for instance , the values we calculated for the fraction of oxygen nuclei which spallate in the atmosphere producing nitrogen nuclei ( @xmath84 ) , are respectively : 1.7% from the partial cross - section model of @xcite ; 1.9% according to the parameterization of @xcite ; 1.5% from fluka @xcite .",
    "in order to estimate how these uncertainties in the corrections for secondary nuclei production in the atmosphere and the instrument affect our final results , we developed the following method . using the same sample of analyzed data for each element",
    ", we varied the values of the charge - changing probabilities in the range allowed by the different models and derived , for each set of values , the corresponding energy spectrum . by comparing the results with the reference spectrum ,",
    "the systematic error for the uncertainty in correcting the differential intensity to the top of instrument is estimated to be 2% for the primary elements . for nitrogen , a 15% error is assigned because of the large contamination of o nuclei which spallate into n. similar values are estimated for the systematic error from the uncertainties in the atmospheric secondary corrections . + the systematic error in the energy scale , as measured by the cal , derives from the accuracy with which the simulated cal response corresponds to the real behavior of the calorimeter at energies not covered by beam test measurements .",
    "we estimate this accuracy at a 5% level , which corresponds , given the cal linearity in the energy range considered in this work , to an energy - scale uncertainty of 5% .",
    "the cream - ii results for primary nuclei are found to be in good agreement with previous measurements of space - based ( _ heao 3 _ c2 @xcite , crn @xcite ) and balloon - borne ( atic-2 @xcite , tracer @xcite ) experiments ( see figures  [ spectra1 ] and [ spectra2 ] ) .",
    "all the elements appear to have the same spectral shape , which can be described by a single power law in energy @xmath73 .",
    "the spectral indices fitted to our data ( table [ tb2 ] ) are very similar , indicating that the intensities of the more abundant ( evenly ) charged heavy elements have nearly the same energy dependence .",
    "our observations , based on a calorimetric measurement of the cr energy , confirm the results recently reported by the tracer collaboration ( figure  [ spectralindex ] ) , using completely different techniques ( cherenkov , specific ionization in gases and transition radiation ) to determine the particle energy .",
    "the weighted average of our fitted spectral indices is @xmath85 , consistent , within error , with the value of @xmath86 obtained from a fit to the combined crn and tracer data @xcite .",
    "the great similarity of the spectral indices suggests that the same mechanism is responsible for the source acceleration of these primary heavy nuclei .",
    "+ although all the elemental spectra can be fitted to a single power law in energy , hardening ( flattening ) of the spectra above @xmath5200 gev/@xmath2 is apparent from the overall trend of the data ( figure  [ spectra2 ] ) . a detailed analysis to investigate possible features in the spectra",
    "is in progress to evaluate the significance of a change in the spectral index .",
    "+ cream - ii data extend the energy range spanned by the previous elemental abundance measurements up to @xmath87 1 tev / n ( figure  [ ratio ] ) . the c / o ratio measured by cream - ii is consistent with the one reported by cream - i @xcite within the overlapping energy region covered by the two flights and slightly higher than the crn result .",
    "the ne / o and mg / o ratios confirm , up to 800 gev/@xmath2 , the nearly flat trend of _ heao 3 _ c2 low - energy data , while the fractions of si and fe with respect to o seem to increase with energy .",
    "this could represent the clue of a possible change in composition of crs at high energies with an enhancement of heavier elements , as expected from snr shock diffusive acceleration theories .",
    "nevertheless , the statistics of the data are too limited for a definitive conclusion at this time .    unlike the primary heavy nuclei",
    ", nitrogen is mostly produced by spallation in the interstellar medium , but it also has a primary contribution of order 10% , as recently measured by cream - i @xcite . the measurement of nitrogen intensity at high energy is challenging because it requires an excellent charge separation between n nuclei and the much more abundant c and o neighbors , as well as a complete understanding of the corrections for secondary n particle production in the atmosphere and the instrument .",
    "the nitrogen data collected by cream - ii are more statistically significant at high energy than any previous observation .",
    "we notice that , above 100 gev/@xmath2 , the n spectrum flattens out from the steep decline which characterizes the energy range 10 - 100 gev/@xmath2 ( figure  [ nspectrum ] ) .",
    "the combined crn and cream - ii data at energies higher than 200 gev/@xmath2 , are well fitted to a power - law in energy with spectral index @xmath88 , consistent within the error with the average value @xmath89 of the primary nuclei .",
    "this supports the hypothesis of the presence of two components in the cosmic nitrogen flux .",
    "in fact , since the escape pathlength decreases rapidly with energy , the secondary nitrogen component is expected to become negligible at high energy , where only the primary component should survive .",
    "this might result in a change of the spectral slope , as observed .",
    "+ as a cross - check to the measurement reported here , we calculate the relative abundance ratio of n / o and compare it with the cream - i observation ( figure  [ ratio ] ) , in which the energy of crs was measured with a transition radiation detector . a n / o ratio ( at the toa ) equal to @xmath3(stat.)@xmath4(sys .",
    ") is measured at an energy of @xmath5800 gev/@xmath2 , in good agreement with recent results from cream - i @xcite .",
    "cream - ii carried out measurements of high-@xmath6 cr nuclei with an excellent charge resolution and a reliable energy determination .",
    "the use of a dual layer of silicon sensors allowed us to unambiguously identify each individual element up to iron and to reduce the background of misidentified nuclei .",
    "we demonstrated the feasibility of measuring the particle energy up to hundreds of tev by using a thin ionization sampling calorimeter , with sufficient resolution to reconstruct accurately the cr spectra .",
    "+ the energy spectra of the major primary heavy nuclei from c to fe were measured up to @xmath510@xmath8 ev and found to agree well with earlier direct measurements .",
    "all the spectra follow a power law in energy with a remarkably similar spectral index @xmath90 , as is plausible if they have the same origin and share the same acceleration and propagation processes . + a new measurement of the nitrogen intensity in an energy region",
    "so far experimentally unexplored indicates a harder spectrum than at lower energies , supporting the idea that nitrogen has secondary as well as primary contributions .",
    "these results provide new clues for understanding the cr acceleration and propagation mechanisms , but further accurate observations with high statistics beyond 10@xmath8 ev are needed to finally unravel the mystery of cr origin .",
    "this work is supported by nasa research grants to the university of maryland , penn state university , and ohio state university , by the creative research initiatives program ( rcmst ) of mest / nrf in korea , and infn and pnra in italy .",
