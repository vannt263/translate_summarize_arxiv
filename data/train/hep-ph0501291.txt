    "experimental measurements of jet production observables are among the most sensitive tests of the theory of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , and yield very accurate determinations of qcd parameters  @xcite , especially of the strong coupling constant @xmath6 . at present ,",
    "the precision of many of these determinations is limited not by the quality of the experimental data , but by the error on the theoretical ( next - to - leading order , nlo ) calculations used for the extraction of the qcd parameters . to improve upon this situation , an extension of the theoretical calculations to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo )",
    "is therefore mandatory .    in the recent past ,",
    "many ingredients to nnlo calculations of collider observables have been derived , including the universal three - loop qcd splitting functions  @xcite which governs the evolution of parton distribution functions at nnlo .",
    "the massless two - loop @xmath7 and @xmath8 matrix elements relevant to nnlo jet production have been computed  @xcite using several innovative methods  @xcite , and are now available for all processes of phenomenological relevance .",
    "the one - loop corrections to @xmath9 and @xmath10 matrix elements have been known for longer and form part of nlo calculations of the respective multi - jet observables  @xcite .",
    "these nlo matrix elements naturally contribute to nnlo jet observables of lower multiplicity if one of the partons involved becomes soft or collinear  @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the infrared singular parts of the matrix elements need to be extracted and integrated over the phase space appropriate to the unresolved configuration to make the infrared pole structure explicit .",
    "methods for the extraction of soft and collinear limits of one - loop matrix elements are worked out in detail in the literature  @xcite . as a final ingredient",
    ", contributions from the tree level @xmath11 and @xmath12 processes also contribute to ( @xmath7)- and ( @xmath8)-type jet observables at nnlo .",
    "these contain double real radiation singularities corresponding to two partons becoming simultaneously soft and/or collinear  @xcite .",
    "to determine the contribution to nnlo jet observables from these configurations , one has to find two - parton subtraction terms which coincide with the full matrix element and are still sufficiently simple to be integrated analytically in order to cancel their infrared pole structure with the two - loop virtual and the one - loop single - unresolved contributions .",
    "several methods have been proposed recently to accomplish this task  @xcite . up to now , only one method has been fully worked through for an observable of physical interest : using the sector decomposition algorithm  @xcite to analytically decompose both phase space and loop integrals into their laurent expansion in dimensional regularization , and subsequent numerical computation of the coefficients of this expansion , results were obtained for @xmath13  @xcite and @xmath14  @xcite at nnlo .",
    "in contrast to all other approaches , in the sector decomposition method one does not have to integrate the subtraction term analytically .    in  @xcite",
    ", we described the construction of nnlo subtraction terms for @xmath13 based on full four - parton tree - level and three - parton one - loop matrix elements , which can be integrated analytically over the appropriate phase spaces  @xcite .",
    "subtraction terms derived from full matrix elements can be viewed as antenna functions , encapsulating all singular limits due to unresolved partonic emission between two colour - connected hard partons  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "process - independent antenna functions describing arbitrary qcd multiparticle processes can be directly related to three - parton matrix elements at nlo ( one unresolved parton radiating between two colour - connected hard partons ) and four - parton matrix elements at nnlo ( two unresolved partons radiating between two colour - connected hard partons ) .",
    "up to now , antenna subtraction terms ( at nlo ) were obtained by construction ( i.e.  by inspecting all limits they had to contain ) , in part from the full matrix elements , and in part by using supersymmetric ( susy ) relations between matrix elements containing fermions and bosons  @xcite .",
    "a systematic procedure to derive antenna functions at nlo and beyond is not available up to now : this paper aims to contribute to such a formalism by showing that quark - gluon antenna functions can be derived systematically from physical matrix elements obtained from an effective lagrangian .",
    "the nnlo subtraction terms derived from four - parton matrix elements with a hard quark - antiquark pair in  @xcite were used subsequently  @xcite to compute the @xmath15correction to @xmath16 at nnlo . to extend this calculation to the remaining colour factors , further subtraction terms must be derived .",
    "in particular , the subtraction terms of  @xcite are sufficient only for processes where unresolved partons are radiated from hard quark - antiquark pairs : they form the quark - antiquark antenna functions at nnlo .",
    "besides quark - antiquark antennae , @xmath16 also contains radiation from hard quark - gluon pairs , the quark - gluon antenna function . in the spirit of  @xcite",
    ", it should be possible to extract these antenna functions from the matrix elements appearing in the nlo and nnlo corrections to a physical one - particle decay process yielding a quark - gluon final state at leading order .",
    "it is the purpose of this letter to show that such a process can be described by an appropriate colour ordering of the decay of a massive neutralino into a massless gluino and a gluon , and to derive the resulting quark - gluon antenna subtraction terms at nlo and nnlo .",
    "to obtain the correct quantum numbers for a quark - gluon antenna function , one has to consider the decay of an off - shell spin-@xmath17 particle into an on - shell spin-@xmath17 particle ( massless quark ) and an on - shell spin-@xmath18 particle ( gluon ) . since the final state quark is in the triplet representation of @xmath19 ,",
    "while the gluon is in the octet representation , this implies that the initial state spin-@xmath17 off - shell particle should also be in the triplet representation .",
    "@xmath19 gauge invariance does however forbid external off - shell states .    in the colour - ordered formulation of qcd tree - level amplitudes  @xcite ,",
    "one decouples the colour quantum numbers of the partons from their lorentz and dirac structure . using this formulation",
    ", one can in particular represent a parton in the adjoint representation as superposition of two partons ( with identical momenta ) in the fundamental representation .",
    "it is thus possible to construct the colour ordered quark - gluon antenna functions from the @xmath19 gauge - invariant decay of an off - shell spin-@xmath17 _ singlet _ state ( neutralino ) into a spin-@xmath17 octet state ( massless gluino ) and a spin-@xmath18 octet state ( gluon ) , as we shall show below .",
    "this decay process occurs in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm,@xcite ) , where it is mediated through a loop involving supersymmetric particles . for the purpose of this study , it is sufficient to describe this process through an effective lagrangian , whose parameters are obtained by integrating out the virtual particles in the loop . in the context of the electroweak sector of the mssm ,",
    "this effective lagrangian was first derived by haber and wyler  @xcite , to describe heavy neutralino decay into a light neutralino and a photon .",
    "its generalization to neutralino decay into gluino and gluon is straightforward : @xmath20 which couples a gluino ( @xmath21 ) and a neutralino ( @xmath22 ) to the qcd field strength tensor @xmath23 .",
    "the coupling @xmath24 has inverse mass dimension , and the commutator of the @xmath25-matrices is @xmath26\\;.\\ ] ] it should be noted that this process was discussed previously in the literature in  @xcite , where however no effective lagrangian was stated .",

    "it should be noted that majorana particles also have a fermion flow direction , which does however not coincide with the fermion number flow .",
    "the momenta are always incoming .",
    "besides these feynman rules and the standard qcd feynman rules , one needs moreover the feynman rule for the gluon - gluino - gluino coupling  @xcite @xmath28    the effective coupling @xmath24 can be computed in the mssm , it was discussed in  @xcite . in the present context ,",
    "its value is irrelevant , but we do have to take into account that @xmath24 is renormalized at one loop . its qcd renormalization constant reads @xmath29 with @xmath30 in susy qcd , both @xmath31 and @xmath32 are modified . throughout this paper ,",
    "we systematically ignore the susy qcd corrections and restrict ourselves to the subclass of contributions which preserve the qcd renormalizations ( [ eq : zeta ] ) and ( [ eq : qcdbeta ] ) .",
    "the basic process for the decay of a neutralino into a gluino plus partons is @xmath33 .",
    "its amplitude reads @xmath34 to display the colour - ordered structure of this amplitude , and to illustrate the relation to quark - gluon amplitudes , we multiply it with @xmath35  @xcite . in the squared amplitude , this factor corresponds to inserting unity since @xmath36 the resulting amplitude is then @xmath37 from this structure , it can be seen that the amplitude contains two colour connected ( hard ) partons and therefore two antennae :    1 .   a quark - gluon antenna , with quark momentum @xmath38 , quark colour index @xmath39 , gluon momentum @xmath40 and gluon colour index @xmath41 .",

    "the factor @xmath50 in ( [ eq : poles1l ] ) appears since the leading order process @xmath51 contains two distinct quark - gluon antennae , in contrast to the single quark - antiquark antenna contained in @xmath49 .",
    "two different emissions off a quark - gluon pair appear at nlo : either the emission of an additional gluon or the splitting of the gluon into a quark - antiquark pair . in the context of the neutralino decay , these correspond to the tree level processes @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",

    "the omission of these corrections is deliberate , since we want to derive the qcd quark - gluon antenna functions . in the following section ,",

    "<S> the computation of exclusive qcd jet observables at higher orders requires a method for the subtraction of infrared singular configurations arising from multiple radiation of real partons . </S>",
    "<S> one commonly used method at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) is based on the antenna factorization of colour - ordered matrix elements , and uses antenna functions to subtract the real radiation singularities . up to now , nlo antenna functions could be derived in a systematic manner only for hard quark - antiquark pairs , while the gluon - gluon and quark - gluon antenna functions were constructed from their limiting behaviour . in this paper , we show that antenna functions for hard quark - gluon pairs can be systematically derived from an effective lagrangian describing heavy neutralino decay . </S>",
