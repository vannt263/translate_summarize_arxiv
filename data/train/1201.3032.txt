    "in the @xmath2 cold dark matter ( @xmath2cdm or lcdm ) model , known as the standard model of cosmology , the formation of structures in the universe is through a hierarchical process of growth of structures , meaning that small structures , like small haloes of galaxies merge to form bigger ones , like galaxy clusters and superclusters haloes . in this picture",
    ", the universe contains around 96 per cent of an unknown form of energy that is usually called dark matter ( dm ) and dark energy .",
    "the @xmath2cdm model can successfully describe cosmological observations such as the large scale distribution of galaxies , the temperature variations in the cosmic microwave background radiation and the recent acceleration of the universe @xcite .    however , recent observations in far and nearby galaxies have shown that the model faces serious conflicts when trying to explain the galaxy formation at small scales @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the @xmath2cdm simulations the halos present rising densities towards the central region behaving as @xmath3 well within 1 kpc @xcite . on the other hand various observations",
    "suggest that the rotation curves are more consistent with a constant central density @xcite , this is most commonly known as the cusp / core problem @xcite .",
    "studying a wide range of galaxies of different morphologies and with magnitudes in the interval @xmath4 @xcite fit their rotation curves ( rc ) using a burkert profile for the dm @xcite and found that @xmath5 remains approximately constant , where @xmath6 with @xmath7 the central dm density and @xmath8 the core radius .",
    "similar results where found in @xcite .",
    "exploring further the constant value of @xmath9 for the dm , @xcite found that within @xmath8 the dm central surface density in terms of the mass inside it ( @xmath10 ) is @xmath11,the gravitational acceleration due to dm felt by a test particle at the radius @xmath8 was found to be @xmath12 additionally they reported the acceleration due to the luminous matter at @xmath8 to be @xmath13 .    in the @xmath2cdm model",
    "the galaxies have evolved through numerous mergers and grown in different environments , the star formation and basic properties of the galaxies are not expected to be a common factor among them . therefore explaining both the constancy of @xmath9 and the core in the central regions of galaxies seems very unlikely in this model .",
    "these problems can be used to test alternative dm models .",
    "there are other models that do not include dm but instead modify the newtonian force law * * f**= m**a * * , one of them is called mond and was proposed by milgrom @xcite , in this modification newton s law reads * f * = m**a**@xmath14 , where the fixed acceleration scale @xmath15 divides the newtonian and mondian regimes , for @xmath16 @xmath17 we have the mondian regime and for @xmath18 we recover the usual newtonian acceleration , the value of @xmath19 .    lately ,",
    "the scalar field dark matter ( sfdm ) model has received much attention . when the scalar field contains a self - interaction this model is also called the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) dark matter model , both names are used in the literature and are interchangeable.the main idea is simple @xcite .",
    "the sfdm model proposes that galaxies form by condensation of a scalar field ( sf ) with an ultra - light mass of the order of @xmath20ev .",
    "therefore , when we mention the sfdm or bec model in this paper we are describing a scalar field that condensates somehow and becomes bose einstein condensate dark matter . from this mass",
    "it follows that the critical temperature of condensation @xmath21tev is very high , thus , they form bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) drops very early in the universe .",
    "it has been proposed that these drops are the haloes of galaxies ( see @xcite ) , @xmath22 , that haloes are gigantic drops of sf . on the other side ,",
    "big structures form like in the lcdm model , by hierarchy @xcite , thus , all predictions of the lcdm model at big scales are reproduced by sfdm .",
    "in other words , in the sfdm model the haloes of galaxies do not form hierarchically , they from at the same time and in the same way when the universe reaches the critical temperature of condensation of the sf , in a similar way as water drops form in the clouds . from this",
    "it follows that all galaxies must be very similar because they formed in the same manner and at the same moment .",
    "therefore , from this model we have to expect that there exist well formed galaxy haloes at bigger redshifts than in the lcdm model . in this model",
    "the scalar particles with this small mass are such that their wave properties avoid the cusp and reduce the high number of small satellites @xcite which is another problem that is still present in the @xmath2cdm model @xcite.summarizing , it is remarkable that with only one free parameter , the ultra - light scalar field mass ( @xmath20ev ) , the sfdm model fits :    1 .   the evolution of the cosmological densities @xcite .",
    "the rotation curves of big galaxies @xcite and lsb galaxies .",
    "3 .   with this mass ,",
    "the critical mass of collapse for a real scalar field is just @xmath23 , i.e. , the one observed in galaxy haloes @xcite .",
    "4 .   the scalar field has a natural cut off , thus the substructure in clusters of galaxies is avoided naturally . with a scalar field mass of @xmath24ev",
    "the amount of substructure is compatible with the observed one @xcite .",
    "we expect that sfdm forms galaxies earlier than the cold dark matter model , because they form becs at a critical temperature @xmath25 tev .",
    "so if sfdm is right , we have to see big galaxies at big redshifts with similar features .",
    "recently it has been demonstrated that sfdm haloes maintain satellite galaxies going around big galaxies for enough time to explain the existence of old stars in the satellites , provided that the mass of the sf is just @xmath26ev @xcite .",
    "the idea was first considered by @xcite and independently introduced by @xcite . in the bec model",
    ", dm halos can be described in the non - relativistic regime , where dm halos can be seen as a newtonian gas .",
    "if we consider a sf self - interaction , we need to add a quartic term to the sf potential , in this case the equation of state of the sf is that of a polytope of index n=1 @xcite .",
    "different issues of bec dm halos and the cosmological behavior of the bec model have been studied in @xcite .",
    "it is a fact that any model trying to become a serious alternative to @xmath2cdm has to succeed not only in reproducing observations in which the standard model fails but also has to keep the solid description at large scale .",
    "for this reason , our aim in this work is to test the bec model with the two observations mentioned above , the cusp / core problem @xcite and the constant dm central surface density . in order to do this",
    ", we used the thomas - fermi approximation and a static bec dm halo to fit rotation curves of a set of galaxies .",
    "however , so far there was no comparison between the density profile and the data , in this work we fill this blank by fitting rotation curves of 13 high resolution low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies and additionally compare the fits to two characteristic density profiles 1 ) the cuspy navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile that results from n - body simulations using @xmath2cdm and 2 ) the pseudo isothermal ( pi ) core profile .",
    "the comparison allow us to show that the model is in general agreement with the data and with a core in the central region .",
    "for our second result we found that the meaning of a core is somewhat ambiguous . in order to clarify the meaning and unify the description , we propose a new definition for the core and core radius that allow us to decide when a density profile is cusp or core . using this definition in the bec model discussed above",
    "we find that the bec model can reproduced the constant value of @xmath9 and as a crosscheck we used the pi profile and find our results to be in very good agreement with observations .",
    "this argues in favor of the model and our definition .    in section 2",
    ", we describe the density profiles we use to fit the rotation curves and we give our definition of the core and core radius . in section 3 , we fit the galaxy data and obtain the fitting parameters and the core radius for the pi and bec density profiles . in section 4 , we discuss our results and in section 5 we give our conclusions .",
    "in this section we provide the dark matter profiles that will be used in the analysis . in the last part of the section we briefly describe the usual meaning of the core and",
    "establish a new definition for it .",
    "the case in which the dark matter is in the form of a static bose - einstein condensate and the number of dm particles in the ground state is very large was considered in @xcite . following this paper and assuming the thomas - fermi approximation @xcite which neglects the anisotropic pressure terms that are relevant only in the boundary of the condensate , the system of equations describing the static bec in a gravitational potential v is given by @xmath27 @xmath28 with the following equation of state @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the mass density of the static bec configuration and @xmath32 is the pressure , as we are considering zero temperature @xmath32 is not a thermal pressure but instead it is produced by the strong repulsive interaction between the ground state bosons .",
    "assuming spherical symmetry and denoting @xmath33 as the radius at which the pressure and density are zero , the density profile takes the form @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the bec central density , @xmath37 is the mass of the dm particle and @xmath38 is the scattering lenght .",
    "the mass at the radius @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 from here the tangential velocity @xmath41 of a test particle at a distance @xmath39 , is @xmath42 the logaritmic slope of a density profile is defined as @xmath43 using ( 7 ) in ( 10 ) it is obtained @xcite @xmath44.\\ ] ] additionaly , the logarithmic slope of the rotation curve is defined @xcite by @xmath45 from ( 9 ) we get @xmath46.\\ ] ]      all the empirical core profiles that exist in the literature fit two parameters , a scale radius and a scale density .",
    "a characteristic profile of this type is @xmath47 this is the pi profile @xcite . here",
    "@xmath48 is the scale radius and @xmath49 is the central density .",
    "the rotation curve is @xmath50      the nfw profile emerges from numerical simulations that use only cdm and are based on the @xmath2cdm model @xcite .",
    "in addition to this , we have chosen this profile because it is representative of what is called the cuspy behavior ( @xmath51 ) in the center of galaxies due to dm .",
    "the nfw density profile @xcite and the rotation curve are given respectively by @xmath52 @xmath53},\\ ] ] @xmath54 is related to the density of the universe at the moment the halo collapsed and @xmath55 is a characteristic radius .      in the large scale simulations that use collissionless cold dark",
    "matter the inner region of dm halos show a density distribution described by a power law @xmath56 with @xmath51 , such behavour is what is now called a cusp .",
    "on the other hand , observations mainly in dwarf and lsb galaxies seem to prefer a central density going as @xmath57 .",
    "this discrepancy between observation and the cdm model receives the name of cusp / core problem . among the empirical profiles most frequently used to describe the constant density behavior in these galaxies are the pi @xcite , the isothermal @xcite and the burkert profile @xcite .",
    "even though their behavior is similar in the central region and is specified by the central density fitting parameter , their second parameter called the core radius does not represent the same idea .",
    "for instance , in the pi profile ( eq.([eq : pi ] ) ) we see that the core radius will be the distance in which the density is half the central density . for",
    "the burkert profile the core radius @xmath58 will be when @xmath59 and for an isothermal profile ( i ) @xcite @xmath60 .",
    "hence , we see an ambiguity in the meaning of the core radius , they get the same name but the interpretation depends on the profile . if we want to compare the central density of lsb galaxies with that of nfw , it usually suffice to have a qualitative comparison , so far this is what we have been doing by fitting empirical profiles .",
    "however , high resolution rotation curves demand a more quantitative comparison . indeed , if we want to test models by fitting rcs we have to know the specific meaning and size of the core , then we will be able to tell if a model is consistent with a cusp or not by making a direct comparison with the data .",
    "for this reason we ask ourselves the question : _ what and where is the core ? _ to solve the previous ambiguity and to unify the concept for future comparisons , we found that a good definition for the @xmath61 is a region where the density profile presents logarithmic slopes @xmath62 and the core radius will be the radius at which the core begins , that is to say , for radius smaller than the core radius we will have @xmath62 , this means that its value @xmath63 is determined by the equation @xmath64 the advantages of this definition are that the interpretation is independent of the profile chosen ( also notice that it applies to the total density profile and is not restricted to that of dm ) and in virtue of the same definition we can directly tell if a dm model profile is cored or cuspy . with our new definition the specific distance at which the core radius occurs still depends on the profile chosen but now the physical interpretation is only one . in the following when we refer to both the core and core radius we adopt the previous interpretation .    applying the definition to ( [ eq : bec ] ) we get the core radius for the bec profile @xmath65 and for comparison we use ( [ eq : pi ] ) because in turns out that the parameter @xmath48 corresponds to the core radius as defined above .",
    "finally , fitting the nfw profile provides a direct comparison between a cusp and core and hence to the cusp / core problem .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "2 we plot @xmath66 using three different values of @xmath33 . from this figure",
    "we see a common behavior .",
    "we have that @xmath66 is a decreasing function of r and is zero before @xmath33 , which tell us that ( 9 ) always reaches a maximun before @xmath33 .",
    "we also notice that there is a region in which @xmath67 , we can take this region to be when @xmath68 . if we use @xmath69 as an upper bound for the region in which the linear behavior ( @xmath67 ) remains valid , we obtain an upper bound radius of @xmath70 .",
    "this means that for values of @xmath71 we expect @xmath67 .",
    "the latter can be used as a test to the bec model by fitting the rcs and veryfing this solid - body behavior within the mentioned region .",
    "the fits of the rcs in fig .",
    "3 prove that the solid - body like behavior characterized by a linear increase of the velocity in the central region is satisfied by the bec model , in fact , it is more consistent with the core pi and bec profiles than the cuspy nfw .",
    "if we now turn to the density profiles , our fits within @xmath72 give an average value of @xmath73=@xmath740.27 @xmath1 0.18 consistent with those obtained in @xcite @xmath73=@xmath740.2 @xmath1 0.2 and with @xmath73=@xmath740.29 @xmath1 0.07 reported by @xcite analyzing 7 things dwarf galaxies .",
    "the case of eso1870510 might be considered to be consistent with nfw profile , however it is the innermost value that considerably decreases @xmath73 , being an irregular galaxy more central data near the innermost region is required to discard the possibility of any violent event that might have caused such a slope value .",
    "the density profiles corresponding to the rcs fits are also shown in fig.3 for each galaxy .",
    "we see that the bec fits slightly deviates for the farthest data points as a result of the finite size of the radius @xmath33 that is fixed by the same data .",
    "this discrepancy is due to the fact that the halo might be more extended than the value @xmath33 . as a matter of a fact , the more extended the `` flat '' outer region in the rcs the more conspicuous the discrepancy .",
    "the main reason of this comes from fig.2 where we infer that the rotation curve speed always presents a maximum value followed by a continuos decrease , which means that to avoid the mentioned discrepancy we need that the bec rotation curve profile remains approximately constant after its maximum . from fig.1",
    "we see that the total rotation curve is dominated by the dark matter contribution , specially in the outer regions .",
    "hence , unless the baryons become the dominant component in the outer regions , which does not seem to be observed , it is unlikely that adding the barionic contribution to the rcs in our galaxies will solve the discrepancy .    some solutions to keep the bec rotation curve constant after its maximum include finite temperature corrections to ( [ eq : pi ] ) @xcite ,",
    "this suffice to alleviate the latter problem in lsb galaxies and dwarfs but not for bigger galaxies .",
    "other authors proposed including vortex lattices @xcite and adding more nodes @xcite in the solution of system ( [ eq : bec1 ] ) and ( [ eq : bec2 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , it can be shown @xcite that a systems of many nodes is unstable , therefore so far no final conclusion has been reached .    when comparing the bec and pi core radius we find a general difference of @xmath75 2 kpc , the core size in the pi profile is approximately 2 kpc smaller than the bec core size , but the pi central density is larger . in u4115 ,",
    "u11557 and u11583 both profiles are very similar which results in a similar core and central density values , this can also be taken as a consistency check for our core definition .    comparing the values of @xmath65 in table 1 we did not find a tendency to a common value .",
    "assuming that the core radius determines the transition where the dm distribution changes from the outer region to the inner constant central density , the lack of a unique value means that there is not a common radius at which this transition takes place .    for our second test we use @xmath65 to calculate ( [ eq : mu ] ) .",
    "we have already seen that @xmath48 and @xmath65 are generally different and @xmath65 is not a fit parameter .",
    "hence _ a priori _ @xmath65 is not expected to correlate with @xmath76 . however , with the values of table 1 we obtain @xmath77 @xmath78 for the average values in the bec and pi profiles respectively .",
    "we see the excellent agreement of ( [ eq : mub ] ) with ( [ eq : mupi ] ) that was used as a crosscheck and with ( [ eq : logmu ] ) in which a much bigger sample was used .",
    "the agreement has shown that the bec model is capable of reproducing the constancy of the value @xmath9 , something that because of the cuspy nature is not possible in the nfw profile .    in fig .",
    "4 we plot the above values for each galaxy .",
    "we define the dm central surface density ( mentioned in the introduction ) for the bec profile by @xmath79 where @xmath80 is obtained from ( [ eq : becm ] ) evaluated at @xmath65 . from table 2",
    "we see that for u11748 the value @xmath81 is considerably above the rest and with the largest uncertainty . for this reason ,",
    "in the following analysis we omit both , this value and the smallest one that corresponds to eso1200211 . doing this we get an average value of eq .",
    "( 19 ) given by @xmath82 191.35 @xmath83 , and for the acceleration felt by a test particle located in @xmath65 due to dm only we have @xmath84 5.2 @xmath85 broadly consistent with ( [ eq : gdm ] ) .    the fact that all galaxies present approximately the same order of magnitude in @xmath86 might suggest that @xmath65 represents more than a transition towards a constant density , it can give us information about the close relation between dm and the baryons .",
    "moreover , in view of the lack of a unique core radius , we can interpret the transition in dm distribution as an effect of crossing a certain acceleration scale instead of a radial length scale .",
    "such interpretation reminds us that given in mond but with the big difference that the acceleration scale found is for dm and is not a postulate of the model .    to determine which interpretation causes the transition whether an acceleration scale or a length scale we will need to study the properties of larger samples of galaxies observed with the new telescopes .",
    "in this paper we find that the bec model gives a constant density profile that is consistent with rcs of dark matter dominated galaxies .",
    "the profile is as good as one of the most frequently used empirical core profiles but with the advantage of coming from a solid theoretical frame .",
    "we fit data within 1 kpc and found a logarithmic slope @xmath73=@xmath740.27 @xmath1 0.18 in perfect agreement with a core .",
    "it is important to notice that the cusp in the central regions is not a prediction that comes from first principles in the cdm model , it is a property that is derived by fitting simulations that use only dm .",
    "we established the ambiguity present in the usual interpretation of the core radius , we proposed a new definition for the core and core radius that takes away the ambiguity and that has a clear meaning that allows for a definite distinction when a density profile is core or cusp .    using our definition",
    "we find the core radius in the bec profile to be in most cases over 2 kpc bigger than the core radius in the pi profile .",
    "we have assumed the dm particles are bosons and that a great number of them is in the ground state in the form of a condensate .",
    "this led us to good results for our sample of galaxies , but it might be necessary to consider more than these simple hypotheses .    as a second result and direct consequence of our core definition , we were able to obtain the constant value of @xmath9 which is proportional to the central surface density .",
    "this result is one of several conflicts that jeopardize the current standard cosmological model .",
    "if we continue to observe even more galaxies with a core behavior , this model can be a good alternative to @xmath2cdm .",
