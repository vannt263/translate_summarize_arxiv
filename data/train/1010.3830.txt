    "symmetries are essential features of quantal systems as they characterize their energetics and provide transition matrix elements of operators with specific selection rules . however , certain emergent phenomena relate to the spontaneous breaking of those symmetries @xcite",
    ". in nuclear systems , such spontaneously - broken symmetries ( i ) relate to specific features of the inter - particle interactions , ( ii ) characterize internal correlations and ( iii ) leave clear fingerprints in the excitation spectrum of the system . in finite systems though , quantum fluctuations can not be ignored such that the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking is only an intermediate description that arises within certain approximations .",
    "eventually , symmetries must be restored to achieve a complete description of the system .",
    "in wave - function - based methods , the symmetry breaking step , e.g. the symmetry unrestricted hartree - fock - bogoliubov approximation , relies on minimizing the average value of the hamiltonian for a trial wave - function that does not carry good quantum numbers , i.e. which mixes irreducible representations of the symmetry group of interest .",
    "restoring symmetries amounts to using an enriched trial wave - function that does carry good quantum numbers .",
    "one typical approach is to project out from the symmetry - breaking trial state the component that belongs to the intended irreducible representation .",
    "wave - function - based projection methods and their variants are well formulated quantum mechanically  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand it is of importance to analyze further their energy density functional ( edf ) counterparts  @xcite which have been _ empirically adapted _ from the former to deal quantitatively with properties of nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the single - reference ( sr ) edf method relies on computing the analog to the symmetry - unrestricted hartree - fock - bogoliubov energy @xmath0 as an a priori general functional @xmath1 $ ] of the density matrices @xmath2 and @xmath3 computed from the product state @xmath4 . here , the label @xmath5 denotes the parameter(s ) of the symmetry group @xmath6 of interest , e.g. euler angles for @xmath7 or the gauge angle for @xmath8 . the multi - reference ( mr ) edf method , that amounts to restore symmetries broken at the sr level , relies on computing the analog to the non - diagonal energy _",

    "a key point is that , as opposed to wave - function - based approaches , the edf method does _ not _ rely on computing @xmath9 $ ] from the average value of a genuine scalar operator @xmath16 such that all expected mathematical properties of such a kernel are not necessarily ensured a priori .",
    "consequently , one may wonder whether the symmetry constraints imposed on the energy kernel @xmath17 $ ] at the sr level  @xcite are sufficient or not to making the mr - edf method well defined ? as a matter of fact , a specific set of constraints to be imposed on the non - diagonal kernel @xmath9 $ ] have been worked out to fulfill basic properties and internal consistency requirements  @xcite .",
    "still , refs .",
    "@xcite have shown in the case of the @xmath8 group , i.e. for particle - number restoration ( pnr ) , that such constraints were not sufficient to making the theory well behaved .",
    "in particular , it was demonstrated  @xcite that fourier components @xmath18 could be different from zero for a negative number of particles @xmath19 .",
    "contrarily , it can be shown that @xmath20 is zero  @xcite for @xmath19 when it is computed as the average value of a genuine operator @xmath16 in a projected wave - function , i.e. in the wave - function - based method . applying the regularization method proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the nullity of the non - physical fourier components was recovered  @xcite .",
    "the case of @xmath8 was particularly instructive given that clear - cut physical arguments could be used to assess that certain coefficients of the ( fourier ) expansion of the energy kernel should be strictly zero .",
    "such an investigation demonstrated that the mr - edf method , as performed so far , faces the danger to be ill - defined and that new constraints on the energy kernel @xmath9 $ ] must be worked out in order to make the symmetry - restoration method physically sound . the regularization method proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite that restores the validity of pnr can only be applied if the edf kernel @xmath17 $ ] depends strictly on integer powers of the density matrices  @xcite , which is an example of such a new constraint .    for an arbitrary symmetry group",
    ", the situation might not be as transparent as for @xmath8 .",
    "indeed , it is unlikely in general that certain coefficients of the expansion of @xmath9 n[g',g]$ ] over irreducible representations of the group are zero based on physical arguments .",
    "the challenge we face can be formulated in the following way : although expansion  [ ssbnormkernel0 ] underlining the mr - edf method is sound from a group - theory point of view , additional mathematical properties deduced from a wave - function - based method must be worked out and imposed on @xmath9 $ ] to make the expansion coefficient @xmath11 physically sound .",
    "the next section briefly discusses an example of such a property in the case of @xmath7 , i.e. for angular momentum restoration , that could be used to constrain the form of the functional kernel @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "more details can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we omit spin and isospin for simplicity and consider the rotationally - invariant nuclear hamiltonian @xmath22 in which three - nucleon and higher many - body forces are disregarded for simplicity . considering an eigenstate @xmath23 of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , as well as using center of mass @xmath26 and relative coordinates @xmath27 , tedious but straightforward calculations allow one to show that the potential energy takes the form  @xcite @xmath28 where the potential energy _ density _",

    "the remarkable mathematical property identified through eq .  [ potentialenergydensity ] is that the scalar potential energy @xmath35 is obtained from an intermediate energy density @xmath29 whose dependence on the orientation of @xmath33 is tightly constrained by the angular - momentum quantum number of the underlying many - body state @xmath23 , i.e. its expansion over spherical harmonics is limited to @xmath36 .",
    "such a result is unchanged when adding the kinetic energy ( density ) to the potential energy ( density ) such that we restrict ourselves to the latter for simplicity .",
    "of course , the energy eventually extracts the coefficient of the lowest harmonic , i.e. @xmath37}_{l0}(r)$ ] .",
    "since property  [ potentialenergydensity ] is general , it is straightforward to show that it can be recovered within the frame of the wave - function - based symmetry - restoration method  @xcite .",
    "the key point to underline relates to the fact that property  [ potentialenergydensity ] can not be derived a priori in the edf method .",
    "indeed , the potential energy part of the kernel @xmath21 $ ] is _ not _ explicitly related to the two - body density matrix in such a case .",
    "consequently , there is no reason a priori that the energy density @xmath38 displays property  [ potentialenergydensity ] ; i.e. the angular dependence of @xmath38 is likely to display harmonics @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",
    "one might argue that it is not an issue considering that the symmetry - restored potential energy @xmath41 eventually relates to the harmonic @xmath42 only .",
    "however , a formalism that provides @xmath38 with a spurious angular content will certainly also provide the coefficient @xmath43 of the lowest harmonic with unphysical contributions . to state it differently ,",
    "it is likely that constraining the mr - edf kernels @xmath44 $ ] to produce an energy density @xmath45 that fulfils the mathematical property  [ potentialenergydensity ] will impact at the same time the value of the weight @xmath46 , and thus the value of @xmath47 .",
    "to some extent , this is similar to the situation encountered with @xmath8 where restoring the mathematical property that fourier coefficients @xmath48 with @xmath19 should be strictly zero impacted the value of all other fourier coefficients  @xcite .",
    "we briefly review the notion of symmetry breaking and restoration within the frame of nuclear energy density functional ( edf ) methods .",
    "multi - reference ( mr ) edf calculations are nowadays routinely applied with the aim of including long - range correlations associated with large - amplitude collective motions that are difficult to incorporate in a more traditional single - reference ( sr ) , i.e.  `` mean - field '' , edf formalism  @xcite .",
    "the framework for mr - edf calculations was originally set - up by analogy with projection techniques and the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) , which are rigorously formulated only within a hamiltonian / wave - function - based formalism  @xcite .",
    "we presently elaborate on key differences between wave - function- and energy - functional - based methods .",
    "in particular , we point to difficulties encountered to formulate symmetry restoration within the energy functional approach .",

    "@xcite for particle number restoration serves as a baseline . reaching out to angular - momentum restoration",
    ", we identify in a wave - function - based framework a mathematical property of the energy density @xmath49 associated with angular momentum conservation that could be used to constrain edf kernels .",
    "consequently , possible future routes to better formulate symmetry restorations in edf - based methods could encompass the following points .    1 .",
    "the fingerprints left on the energy density @xmath49 by angular momentum conservation in a wave - function - based method could be exploited to constrain the functional form of the basic edf kernel @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "2 .   the regularization method proposed in ref .  @xcite to deal with specific spurious features of mr - edf calculations should be investigated as to what impact it has on properties of the energy density @xmath45 in the case of angular momentum restoration .",
    "similar mathematical properties extracted from a wave - function - based method could be worked out for other symmetry groups of interest and used to constrain edf kernels .",
