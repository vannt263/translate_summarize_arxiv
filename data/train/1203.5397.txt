    "an important issue within inverse problems and imaging @xcite is to develop an appropriate treatment of the uncertainty associated with the related quantity of interest ( the state ) , and the observation process , respectively .",
    "statistical methods provide many useful concepts and tools in this regard such as identifiability , sufficient statistics , fisher information , statistically based decision rules and bayesian estimation , see _ e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "the bayesian view is _",
    "e.g. _ , based on the assumption that uncertainty always can be represented as a probability distribution .",
    "hence , statistical information about the state can be retrieved by means of bayesian filtering such as kalman filters , extended kalman filters and particle filters , see e.g. @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", the conditional fisher information can be a useful `` deterministic '' analysis tool in various inverse problem applications such as with material measurements @xcite , parametric shape estimation @xcite , sensitivity analysis and preconditioning in microwave tomography @xcite , and in electrical impedance tomography @xcite .",
    "the cramr - rao lower bound can furthermore be used to quantify the trade - off between the accuracy and the resolution of a linear or non - linear inverse problem @xcite , and it complements the deterministic upper bounds and the l - curve techniques that are employed with linearized inversion , see _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "the fisher information is also a tool that can be exploited for optimal experimental design , see _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "the fisher information analysis has mostly been given in a finite - dimensional setting , see _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite",
    ". one of the very few exceptions can be found in _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite where the fisher information integral operator for an infinite - dimensional parameter function has been employed in the estimation of wave forms ( or random processes ) .",
    "an infinite - dimensional fisher information operator has previously been exploited in the context of inverse problems in _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite , and the connection to the singular value decomposition ( svd ) has been established .",
    "however , so far , a rigorous treatment of gaussian noise on infinite - dimensional hilbert spaces has been lacking .    a fisher information analysis for inverse problems based on gaussian noise on infinite - dimensional hilbert space @xcite requires a careful study of the range spaces and the spectrum of the operators related to the covariance of the noise , and the jacobian of the forward operator , respectively .",
    "it is assumed here that the covariance operator is trace class and the jacobian is hilbert - schmidt @xcite . since the range space of the covariance operator always is strictly smaller than the hilbert space , the appropriate space for defining the fisher information operator is given by the cameron - martin space @xcite . in order for the fisher information to be well - defined",
    ", it is furthermore required that the range space of the jacobian is contained in the cameron - martin space . in order for this condition to hold and for the fisher information to be trace class ,",
    "it is shown in this paper that it is sufficient that the singular values of the jacobian and the eigenvalues of the covariance operator satisfy some regularity assumptions regarding their relative rate of convergence .",
    "it is also shown how the cramr - rao lower bound for parameter estimation based on finite - dimensional eigenspaces is closely linked to the singular value decomposition ( svd ) , and the truncated pseudo - inverse based on the cameron - martin space .",
    "the situation becomes particularly simple if the covariance operator and the jacobian share the same left - singular vectors , implying that a sequence of finite - dimensional subspace estimators ( truncated pseudo - inverses ) may readily be analyzed . in this case , the eigenvalues of the fisher information is simply the ratio between the squared singular values of the jacobian , and the eigenvalues of the covariance operator .",
    "two important special cases arises : 1 ) the infinite - dimensional fisher information operator exists and is trace class , and the corresponding pseudo - inverse ( and the cramr - rao lower bound ) exists only for finite - dimensional subspaces .",
    "2 ) the infinite - dimensional pseudo - inverse ( and the cramr - rao lower bound ) exists , and the corresponding fisher information operator exists only for finite - dimensional subspaces .",
    "a concrete example is considered regarding an electromagnetic inverse source problem with `` external '' spherically isotropic noise , as well as `` internal '' uncorrelated noise .",
    "the example illustrates how the singular values of the jacobian , the eigenvalues of the covariance operator and the internal noise variance can be analyzed and interpreted in terms of the cramr - rao lower bound .",
    "below , two common situations will be considered in parallel , where the parameter space ( describing the quantity of interest ) is real or complex , respectively .",
    "the observation process ( the measurement ) is assumed to be executed in the frequency - domain with complex valued data .",
    "hence , an inverse problem is considered below where @xmath0 denotes the complex valued measurement and @xmath1 the real or complex valued parameter function to be estimated .",
    "the forward operator is defined as the mapping @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are separable hilbert spaces @xcite .",
    "the measurement space @xmath4 is complex , and the parameter space @xmath3 is either real or complex .",
    "the same notation @xmath5 is employed here to denote the scalar products in both spaces .",
    "let @xmath6 denote the real part of @xmath7 .",
    "note that @xmath8 is a scalar product defined on the elements @xmath9 and @xmath10 of @xmath4 interpreted as a hilbert space over the real scalar field . in this space , the vectors @xmath0 and @xmath11 are orthogonal , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath12 , and the norm is preserved , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath13 .",
    "hence , the hilbert space @xmath4 over the complex scalar field with basis vectors @xmath14 is isomorphic with the hilbert space @xmath4 over the real scalar field , and with basis vectors given by @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "it is assumed that the forward operator @xmath16 is frchet differentiable @xcite in a neighborhood of the ( background ) parameter vector @xmath17 .",
    "the first order variation @xmath18 can then be represented as @xmath19 where the bounded linear operator @xmath20 is the frchet derivative ( or jacobian ) of the operator @xmath16 evaluated at @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is an incremental parameter function where @xmath23 .",
