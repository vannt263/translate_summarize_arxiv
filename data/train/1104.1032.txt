    "the standard solar models with the latest input physics are well known to yield the solar structure to an amazing degree of precision , and agree with the helioseismic inversions ( see e.g. , christensen - dalsgaard et al .",
    "1996 ; bahcall et al .",
    "those models use the old abundance values ( grevesse & savual 1998 , hereafter gs98 ) . however , the standard solar models with the new solar mixture ags05 ( asplund et al .",
    "2005 , hereafter ags05 ) disagree with helioseismic constraints , e.g. , the position of the base of convection zone ( cz ) is too shallow and the surface helium abundance is lower than in the sun @xcite .",
    "larger discrepancies are in the sound - speed and density profiles between the sun and the models with low @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for a detailed review paper .",
    "a number of investigations have attempted to explain this discrepancy as a matter of improved physical inputs in the standard solar model such as : enhanced diffusivity , opacity increases , convective overshooting , low - z accretion @xcite and revised solar composition ( asplund et al .",
    "2009 , hereafter agss09 ) .",
    "the results of all of these analyses show that it is difficult reproduce the helioseismic constraints with the standard solar model also when it includes the latest abundances",
    ". this failure could be due to the fact that the standard solar model neglects rotation , magnetic fields and some extra - mixing processes . in this letter",
    ", we show that these effects can reduce the discrepancies .",
    "helioseismology has revealed that the sun is rotating differentially at the surface , slowly in the core and almost uniformly in the radiative region @xcite .",
    "the purely rotation - induced mixing has been considered in modeling rotating stars , as given in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . however , these models appear insufficient to reproduce the helioseismically inferred internal solar rotation profile .",
    "this suggests that other effects should be considered in extracting angular momentum from the central core of the sun .",
    "recently , two main mechanisms have been proposed to explain the solar flat rotation profile , namely internal gravity waves ( e.g. charbonnel & talon 2005 ) and magnetic fields ( e.g. eggenberger et al . 2005 ) .",
    "here , we mainly describe the efficiency of the extra - mixing caused by rotation and magnetic fields , as prescribed by the tayler - spruit dynamo @xcite .",
    "the theoretical formulation of this dynamo is still a matter of debate @xcite , however , @xcite found that the model with the tayler - spruit dynamo - type field successfully reproduces the observed solar rotation profile .",
    "therefore , it is particularly interesting to investigate the effects of rotation and magnetic fields on the solar interior and global parameters .",
    "we present a simple scheme for dealing with angular momentum transport and element mixing in the solar interior .",
    "it is based on the stellar structure equations which include rotation and magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the detailed derivation is given in @xcite .",
    "this formulation allows us to estimate the effects of rotation and magnetic fields on the sun properties .",
    "the angular momentum transport and elements mixing can be described with two diffusion equations as follows : @xmath1 , \\\\",
    "\\frac{\\partial x_{i}}{\\partial t}&= & f_{c}\\frac{1}{\\rho r^{2}}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left[\\rho r^{2}(d_{rot}+d_{m}^{'})\\frac{\\partial x_{i}}{\\partial r}\\right]+\\left(\\frac{\\partial x_{i}}{\\partial t}\\right)_{nuc}+\\left(\\frac{\\partial x_{i}}{\\partial t}\\right)_{micro},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the adjustable parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 are introduced to represent some inherent uncertainties in the diffusion equations .",
    "the second and third terms on the right - hand - side of equation ( 2 ) are the nuclear and gravitational settling terms , respectively . in our model , the diffusion coefficient @xmath4 is associated with the rotational instability as described by @xcite . in the case of a tayler - spruit dynamo - type field , the diffusion coefficient for the angular momentum transport can be written as @xcite : @xmath5 and the one for chemical element transport as : @xmath6 equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) are valid in the regime of negligible thermal diffusion , namely @xmath7 , where @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) represents the thermal ( @xmath10- ) gradients associated with buoyancy frequency .",
    "when this condition is violated , we should replace equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) with @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the thermal diffusivity .",
    "additionally , in order to reproduce the solar surface angular velocity , we adopt the @xcite braking law : @xmath15 where @xmath16 g @xmath17 s and @xmath18 is an adjustable parameter related to the magnitude of the magnetic fields .",
    "our solar models are obtained from the one - dimensional yale rotating stellar evolution code ( yrec ; guenther et al . 1992 ; li et al . 2003 ; yang & bi 2006 ) , by including rotation , magnetic fields and relevant extra - mixing processes .",
    "in addition , we use the following updated physical quantities : opal equation of state tables eos2005 @xcite , the opacities ( gs98 , ags05 and agss09 ) supplemented by the low - temperature opacities @xcite , diffusive element settling @xcite and the krishna - swamy atmosphere @xmath19 relation .    in order to investigate the influence of rotation and magnetic fields , we constructed these solar models in accord with different physical processes corresponding to different solar compositions . in the numerical calculations ,",
    "all models are calibrated from the initial zero - age main sequence ( zams ) to the present solar - age models , for which the radius is @xmath20 cm , the luminosity @xmath21 erg / g , the mass @xmath22 g and the adopted photospheric @xmath23 ratio .",
    "the free variables are the initial helium abundance @xmath24 , the initial metallicity @xmath0 and the mixing - length parameter , all of which are adjusted to match these observational constraints .",
    "in addition , we assumed that the convective region rotates rigidly , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "the initial angular velocity is another free parameter that can be tuned so that the surface velocities of solar - age models match the observed values .",
    "figure 1 shows the angular velocity as a function of radius @xmath25 at the ages of 2.0 gyr and 4.57 gyr . for the purely rotating model",
    ", the @xmath26-gradient clearly appears in the radiative region . in the solar interior , the angular velocity increases with increasing age during the main sequence , while in the surface it is just the opposite . as a consequence of this at the present age",
    "the core rotation velocity is about four times as large as the surface one . on the other hand ,",
    "the angular velocity profile for the model with magnetic fields is significantly different . during the main - sequence stage ,",
    "the sun is a quasi - solid body .",
    "it is interesting to note that at the age of 4.57 gyr , the surface rotation velocity predicated by both models is approximately @xmath27 rad / s .",
    "however , the total angular momentum is quite different . for the calibrated models ,",
    "the total angular momentum of the rotating model at the age 4.57 gyr is @xmath28 g @xmath17 s@xmath29 , which is about five times as large as the seismic result @xmath30 g @xmath17 s@xmath29 @xcite ; while for the model with magnetic fields at the same age , the total angular momentum is @xmath31 g @xmath17 s@xmath29 , which is in good agreement with the result obtained by helioseismology at @xmath32 level .",
    "the magnetic field thus constitutes a more efficient process to transport angular momentum because it enhances the coupling between the radiative zone and convective one .",
    "rotation and magnetic fields have important consequences on the chemical composition profile of the outer convective envelope , as shown in figure 2 . by comparing the models with and without rotation and magnetic fields",
    ", we find that the extra - mixing process counteracts the effect of diffusive settling in the outer envelope .",
    "hence , the model with rotation and magnetic fields has a smoother helium abundance profile than the standard solar model with the same abundance .",
    "this leads to a change in the cz structure , as well as improvements in the sound speed and density profiles .    for further investigation of the magnetic field s role ,",
    "figure 3 shows in detail the differences between the calculated and inferred sound - speed and density profile @xcite .",
    "the different lines refer to calibrated evolved models at the age of 4.57 gyr , each using a different abundance , indicated as gs98 , ags05 and agss09 .",
    "it is clearly visible that the discrepancy between seismic inferences and solar models with the new lower abundances is much larger than one with the old abundance .",
    "as illustrated by the different curves , the effects of rotation and magnetic fields on the stellar structure equations change the hydrostatic equilibrium and thermodynamic variables on the solar interior , and therefore also have a significant impact on the solar models . table 1 summarizes the main characteristics of our calibrated models .",
    "interestingly , among all the models listed in the table , model agss09c shows the best agreement with the inversions .",
    "this model reproduces the sound speed and density profiles in within @xmath33 , while for model gs98a the discrepancy is about @xmath34 .",
    "furthermore , model agss09c predicts the position of the cz base at @xmath35 which shows a @xmath36 discrepancy , while agss09a model shows a @xmath37 one . for the surface helium abundance",
    "the situation is analogous : model agss09c predicts @xmath38 with a @xmath39 discrepancy , while model agss09a shows the discrepancy at @xmath40 level .",
    "although the models including rotation and magnetic fields show some improvements with respect to the standard solar model , they still disagree with the seismic constraints .",
    "we have investigated the effects of rotation and magnetic fields on the solar models , and have found that when these effects are included , alongside the new abundances , the revised solar models can better reproduce the helioseismic constraints .",
    "however , we see that it is difficult to match simultaneously the new abundances and helioseismology data for sound speed , density profiles , convection zone depth and surface helium abundance .",
    "although the tayler - spruit dynamo type magnetic field still needs to be studied further , our results show that it does provide a possible explanation for the solar abundance problem .",
    "we have neglected turbulence , which may feed the differential rotation and sustain magnetic fields in the convection zone , and other interactions .",
    "these physical processes will be considered in our future work .",
    "the results obtained in this paper are encouraging and we intend to apply our model to solar - type stars to get a proper interpretation of the existing helioseismic observations and the coming asteroseismic ones .    s.l.b .",
