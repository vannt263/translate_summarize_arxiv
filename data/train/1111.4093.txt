    "the investigation of rare @xmath7 decays induced by the flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) transitions @xmath8 and @xmath9 represents an important test of the standard model ( sm ) and its extensions ( see @xcite for a review ) .    among the rare decays ,",
    "the process @xmath10 , where the virtual photon is converted to the lepton pair , is of considerable interest .",
    "this decay proceeds through a loop ( penguin ) diagram , to which high - mass particles introduced in various extensions to the sm may contribute with sizable amplitudes . in this decay the angular distributions and lepton polarizations",
    "can probe the chiral structure of the matrix element @xcite and thereby effects of the new physics ( np ) beyond the sm .    in order to unambiguously measure effects of np in the observed process @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , mediated by @xmath13 decay , one needs to calculate the sm predictions with a high accuracy .",
    "the amplitude in the sm consists of the short - distance ( sd ) and long - distance ( ld ) contributions .",
    "the former are expressed in terms of the wilson coefficients @xmath14 calculated in perturbative qcd up to a certain order in @xmath15 ; they carry information on processes at energy scales @xmath16 .",
    "the ld effects describing the hadronization process are expressed in terms of matrix elements of several @xmath17 operators between the initial @xmath7 and the @xmath18 final state .",
    "these hadronic matrix elements are parameterized in terms of form factors @xcite that are calculated in various approaches ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the additional ld effects , originating from intermediate vector resonances @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23,@xmath24 , in general , may complicate theoretical interpretation and make it more model dependent . the vector resonances modify the amplitude and thus may induce , for example , the right - handed currents which are absent in the sm .",
    "present experimental studies  @xcite of the @xmath25 decay aim at the search of effects of the np in the whole region of dilepton invariant mass @xmath26 gev ( here @xmath27 ) . in these analyses",
    "certain cuts are applied in order to exclude a rather big charmonia contribution .",
    "recently also the region of small dilepton invariant mass , @xmath28 gev , attracted attention @xcite , as having a potential for searching signatures of the np .",
    "the authors of @xcite analyzed the azimuthal angular distribution in the decay @xmath29 in this region , to test the possibility to measure this distribution at the lhcb .",
    "they have shown the feasibility of measurements with small systematic uncertainties . in ref .",
    "@xcite the influence of the low - lying resonances @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 on differential branching ratio , polarization fraction of the @xmath30 and transverse asymmetry @xmath31 has been studied .    in the present paper",
    "we extend calculations of @xcite to the whole region of dilepton invariant mass up to @xmath32 gev .",
    "the effective sm hamiltonian with the wilson coefficients in the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) approximation is applied .",
    "the ld effects mediated by the resonances , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath33 with @xmath34 , are included explicitly in terms of the helicity amplitudes of the decays @xmath35 .",
    "the information on the latter is taken from experiments if available ; otherwise it is taken from theoretical predictions .",
    "the fully differential angular distribution over the three angles and dilepton invariant mass for the four - body decay @xmath36 is analyzed .",
    "we define a convenient set of asymmetries which allows one to extract these asymmetries from the angular distribution once sufficient statistics is accumulated .",
    "these asymmetries may have sensitivity to various effects of the np , although in order to see signatures of these effects , the resonance contribution should be accurately evaluated .",
    "one of the ingredients in calculation of the resonance contribution is the transition vertex @xmath37 .",
    "this vertex is conventionally treated in the vector - meson - dominance ( vmd ) model . in the present paper",
    "we apply two versions of the vmd model ( called subsequently vmd1 and vmd2 ) which result in rather different @xmath37 vertices , in particular , far from the vector - meson mass shell @xmath38 . specifically , due to explicit gauge - invariant construction of the vmd2",
    "lagrangian the @xmath37 transition is suppressed in the region @xmath39 ( for @xmath40 ) .",
    "this observation may be important for estimation of resonance contribution to those asymmetries , which are small in the sm .",
    "one should mention that the @xmath41 vector resonances @xmath42 have been included earlier in refs .",
    "@xcite in the analysis of the @xmath43 decay .",
    "this method of including resonances has been originally suggested in @xcite . in order to see sensitivity of observables to the method of including the @xmath41 resonances ,",
    "we perform calculations using the two methods , and compare the results .    results of the present calculations are compared with the recent data from belle ( kekb ) and cdf ( tevatron ) experiments for the differential branching , asymmetry @xmath31 , longitudinal polarization fraction of @xmath18 and forward - backward asymmetry .",
