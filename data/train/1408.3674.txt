    "7,8 of @xcite and with the alice data in figs .",
    "9,10 of @xcite .",
    "the influence of _ viscous corrections _ on photon spectra and anisotropic flow coefficients @xmath50 has been investigated in two viscous hydro models : ( 3 + 1)d music @xcite which is based on bumpy e - b - e fluctuating initial conditions from impact parameter dependent glasma type ( ip - glasma ) and ( 2 + 1)d vish2 + 1 @xcite with bumpy e - b - e fluctuating initial conditions from the monte - carlo glauber model . both hydros include viscous qgp ( with lqcd eos ) and hg fluids and reproduce well the hadronic bulk observables .",
    "the photon rate has been modified in @xcite in order to account for first order non - equilibrium ( viscous ) corrections to the standard equilibrium rates ( i.e. the thermal qgp @xcite and hg @xcite rates ) .",
    "it has been found that the viscous corrections only slightly increase the high @xmath26 spectra compared to the ideal hydro calculations while they have a large effect on the anisotropic flow coefficients @xmath50 - see fig . 9 in @xcite .",
    "interesting that the viscous suppression of hydrodynamic flow anisotropies for photons is much stronger than for hadrons .",
    "also the photon @xmath50 are more sensitive to the qgp shear viscosity which serve the photon @xmath50 as a qgp viscometer @xcite .",
    "iii . ) another idea , which has been checked recently within the ( 2 + 1)d vish2 + 1 viscous hydro model @xcite , is associated with the generation of _ pre - equilibrium flow _ ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the idea of initial flow has been suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite and modeled as a rapid increase of bulk @xmath0 in the expanding fireball model which leads to a substantial enhancement of photon @xmath0 . in a viscous hydro @xcite the generation of pre - equilibrium flow has been realized using a free - streaming model to evolve the partons to 0.6 @xmath51 where the landau matching takes over to switch to viscous hydro .",

    "the approach consistently describes the full evolution of a relativistic heavy - ion collision from the initial hard scatterings and string formation through the dynamical deconfinement phase transition to the strongly - interacting quark - gluon plasma as well as dynamical hadronization and the subsequent interactions in the expanding hadronic phase as in the hsd transport approach @xcite .",

    "<S> we discuss the latest theoretical results on direct photon and dilepton production from relativistic heavy - ion collisions . while the dilepton spectra at low invariant mass show in - medium effects like a collisional broadening of the vector meson spectral functions , the dilepton yield at high invariant masses ( above 1.1 gev )  is dominated by qgp contributions for central heavy - ion collisions at relativistic energies . </S>",
    "<S> the present status of the photon @xmath0 `` puzzle ''  a large elliptic flow @xmath0 of the direct photons experimentally observed at rhic and lhc energies - is also addressed . </S>",
    "<S> the role of hadronic and partonic sources for the photon spectra and @xmath0 is considered as well as the possibility to subtract the qgp signal from the experimental observables .    </S>",
