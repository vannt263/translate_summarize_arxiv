    "a three  dimensional uniaxial nematic has stable point ( monopole ) and line ( disclination ) defects .",
    "the former include both radial ( charge + 1 ) and hyperbolic ( charge -1 ) geometries @xcite which are topologically equivalent .",
    "disclination line defects are either of the wedge or twist variety .",
    "either variety is characterized by a @xmath4 director rotation about the line ( i.e. the defects have charge @xmath5 ) .",
    "a twist disclination loop is shown in fig .",
    "[ twistdiscfig ] .",
    "note that the loop carries zero monopole charge and the director configuration is uniform at large distances from the loop .",
    "wedge disclination loops on the other hand carry a net charge , and at large distances from them the director configuration is equivalent to that of a monopole of charge 1 .",
    "another type of line defect is characterized by director rotations of @xmath6 ( type-1  line)and is unstable to `` escaping in the third dimension , '' into a non - singular configuration @xcite ( see fig . [ escapefig ] ) .",
    "these escaped structures can still be observed experimentally @xcite , however , and we can also visualize them in our simulation .    the dynamical scaling hypothesis @xcite for phase ordering processes asserts that there is a characteristic length @xmath7 ( _ e.g. , _ the domain size or defect separation ) such that the system appears to be time - independent ( in a statistical sense ) when all lengths are rescaled by @xmath7 . for nematics ,",

    "note that defects occur at the intersections of domains growing with differing director orientations ( the kibble mechanism @xcite ) .",
    "until the domains are large enough , defects are neither well - defined nor well - separated ( one needs a defect separation larger than the defect core size @xcite ) so scaling is only assumed to hold at `` late '' times .",
    "experiments are generally consistent with scaling predictions except perhaps in the behavior of monopoles @xcite . simulations also demonstrate scaling @xcite but with calculated exponents somewhat different from theory and experiment . there have also been indications in simulations that more than one characteristic length may be present @xcite , but this is possibly just a finite - size effect .",

    "( [ strucdefect ] ) are replaced by a single contribution proportional to @xmath26 arising from disclination points characterized by @xmath27 director rotations . in the three - dimensional case",
    "the disclination contribution proportional to @xmath28 appears for twist and wedge disclination loops ( as well as any curved disclination loop segment ) at wavevectors @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the radius of the loop @xcite . for smaller wavevectors ,",
    "there is no power ",
    "law contribution to the structure factor from the twist loops ( recall that the director configuration is homogeneous at large distances from the loop ) , and wedge loops contribute a term of the same form as the monopoles .",
    "the defect contributions to the structure factor above are specific examples of porod s law @xcite which states that @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the defect density , @xmath33 is the number of spatial dimensions and @xmath34 is the defect dimensionality ( _ e.g. , _ points have @xmath35 and lines have @xmath36 ) .",
    "experiments @xcite show good scaling of @xmath23 with an asymptotic exponent approximately equal to 5 , with the approach through effective exponents lying between 5 and 6 @xcite .",
    "zapotocky and goldbart @xcite have shown that such behavior would be consistent with the presence of sufficient numbers of monopoles or wedge disclination loops .",
    "however , experimentally the population of monopoles seems too low , and wedge disclinations are energetically less preferable @xcite than twist disclinations for typical values of the nematic elastic constants ( though the former defects might be generated dynamically ) . from eq .",
    "( [ strucdefect ] ) we see that thermal fluctuations will dominate the structure factor for sufficiently large wavevectors satisfying @xmath37 ( assuming that monopoles are not present in large numbers ) .",
    "this behavior has not been seen in the experimental studies @xcite carried out thus far .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the scattering experiments were performed over a time range where the defect density is sufficiently large that the crossover to thermal regime is not evident for wavevectors in the visible range .",
    "we performed a molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation using the gay - berne model@xcite , an intermolecular potential similar to the simple lennard - jones potential but extended to model the anisotropic mesogen shape .",
    "the complete gay - berne potential is as follows @xcite : @xmath38 @xmath39 , \\label{gbpot}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 give the orientations of the long axes of molecules @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively , and @xmath43 is the intermolecular vector ( @xmath44 ) .",

    "some representative plots of the gay - berne  potential energy curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ gbfig ] .    for the adjustable parameters , we used the values suggested by berardi et al .",
    "@xcite : @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "these values yield a nematic phase over a wider range of temperatures , compared to the original parameterization chosen by gay and berne @xcite .",
    "the temperature was controlled by velocity rescaling @xcite , and the density was fixed at @xmath63 with the dimensions of the simulation box in the ratio 2:2:1 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were applied .",
    "the system was equilibrated at @xmath64 in the isotropic phase for 130000 md time steps ( with a dimensionless time step of 0.004 ) and then a quench to @xmath65 was implemented ( the nematic - isotropic transition temperature is approximately 3.5 ) .",
    "the system gradually came to equilibrium in the nematic phase with the order parameter @xmath66 ( the largest eigenvalue of @xmath67 ) saturating at a value of @xmath68 over the next 100000 steps .",
    "we used a domain decomposition approach on the cray t3e at the san diego supercomputing center .",
    "briefly , the domain decomposition approach involves dividing up the simulation volume into a number of cells , each controlled by a different processor ( we used 64 cells ) . because the gay - bernepotential is short - ranged , most of the intermolecular interactions involve same - cell molecules ; thus , only the relatively small number of molecules near cell boundaries will require interprocessor communications . the cell scheme and",
    "the required communications are somewhat difficult to implement , but provide very significant computational speedups .",
    "a computational scheme similar to ours is described in more detail in @xcite ( although we used a slightly different communication scheme in which an additional map tracking the specific subcells to be transferred between specific neighbors was implemented ) .",
    "we obtained timings virtually identical to those reported in the latter reference ( on the order of 1 second per timestep with a 64 node partition of the cray ) .",
    "our computation time increases linearly with the number of particles and with the number of processing elements , indicating good scalability of our code .",
    "a preliminary step for locating defects is to break the system into a lattice of cubic bins .",
    "note that the creation of a lattice is strictly for convenience in defect finding ; the time evolution of the system allows for complete translational freedom .",
    "even experiments , of course , have `` binning '' inherent in the resolution of the optical microscopy . within each bin , the order parameter tensor @xmath67 , eq .",
    "( [ ordparamtens ] ) , was calculated , its largest eigenvalue taken as the local order parameter @xmath66 and the corresponding eigenvalue as the local director @xmath69 .",
    "the bin size was chosen so that the core size of the disclinations , determined from the distance over which @xmath66 dropped significantly below the background value , was of the order of one lattice spacing . in our case , this resulted in a @xmath70 lattice , each bin holding roughly 30 molecules .",
    "it is with this lattice of orientation vectors that we began analyzing planes parallel to the @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 axes for the presence of defects .",
    "note that while it is convenient to work with the orientation _",
    "vectors _ on the lattice , we must remember that the actual directors are _ headless _ ( expressing the symmetry upon rotation by 180@xmath74 about an axis perpendicular to the director ) and so some care must be taken to account for this .    a nice method of searching for disclinations was introduced in @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) .",
    "consider the directors at the corners of a square ( one of the faces of a cube ) in our three ",
    "dimensional lattice .",
    "the idea is to track the course of the intersections of these vectors with the order parameter sphere ( actually the projective plane @xmath75 ) as one moves around the corners of the real - space square ( fig .",
    "[ discalgfig ] ) . starting with the intersection of @xmath76 with the sphere ,",
    "one then takes as the next point either the intersection of @xmath77 or @xmath78 , whichever is closest to @xmath76 s intersection .",
    "once this point is determined , either @xmath79 or @xmath80 is used , depending on the proximity to the previously defined point , and so on . once the last point ( from corner d ) is determined , one looks at whether its intersection is in the same hemisphere as the starting point s .",
    "if so , no defect is present  the path in order parameter space is deformable to a single point , _ i.e. , _ a uniform configuration .",
    "if the first and last points are in different hemispheres , however , then a disclination  line is taken to cut through the center of the square and is oriented perpendicular to the plane of the square .    to find",
    "escaped type-1 lines we performed a similar procedure , except that we measured the actual arclength swept out as one moves from each intersection to the next .",
    "arclengths greater than @xmath81 are counted as type-1 lines  if the lattice square has not already been determined to hold a disclination  ( obviously , there is some overlap in the methods ) .",
    "the arclength @xmath81 corresponds to an escaped structure similar to that of fig .",
    "[ escapefig ] with an opening angle of about 30@xmath74 .",
    "experimentally , smaller opening angles are observable as type-1 lines , but smaller cutoff values of the arclength produced too many random type-1  line segments unconnected with each other or with disclinations , a situation not in accord with experiments .    finally , to look for monopoles , we used the method from @xcite .",
    "each of the six faces of a lattice cube is divided into two triangles and the corresponding directors are used to map out spherical triangles on the order parameter sphere .",
    "total areas on the sphere greater than @xmath82 are considered to be monopoles  and the defect is placed at the center of the corresponding lattice cube .",
    "note that in all these defect - finding procedures , one must be careful to apply periodic boundary conditions to the edge lattice sites .",
    "one could also consider simulating the effect of crossed polarizers on individual planes .",
    "we used the method of @xcite which , phrased in the language of the stokes parameters , uses mller matrices to simulate the effect of a group of molecules on the polarization of incoming light . in this method , one must set values for the ordinary and extraordinary refractive indices ; we used typical experimental values between 1.5 and 2 @xcite .",
    "the remaining free parameter , the ratio of the thickness of the cell to the wavelength of light , was chosen to be the value which makes the calculated outgoing intensity for molecules oriented at 45@xmath74 to the crossed polarizer directions equal to one ; we used a value of 2.5 .",
    "visualizing the resulting contour plots is aided by choosing an exponential distribution of contour values in order to sharpen the dark areas ( the `` brushes '' @xcite ) .",
    "this method did yield planes in which two clear brushes met at fairly well - localized points ( fig .",
    "[ xpolarfig ] ) , indicating the presence of a disclination but in general , the brushes and intersections were simply not well - determined enough to be useful .",
    "we estimate that an order of magnitude increase in the number of bins ( corresponding to several million gay - berne  particles ) would be required to use this crossed polarizer approach quantitatively .",
    "with the methods described , we observed a coarsening sequence  compare fig .",
    "[ coarsefig ] with similar figures in @xcite  which exhibited most of the general behaviors observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "an animation of our results is available on our web site @xcite .",
    "shortly after the quench , there was a dense tangle of defect lines .",
    "this tangle gradually thinned out and we could clearly identify and follow individual defect loops . with the exception of one wedge disclination line @xcite running through the sample , all of the disclination  lines were of twist type ( see fig .",
    "[ twistfig ] ) and with periodic boundary conditions formed closed loops .",
    "the presence of twist lines is consistent @xcite with the relative values of the elastic constants in the gay - berne nematic @xcite , namely @xmath83 .",
    "apart from the exception mentioned above we saw no evidence for dynamically generated wedge disclination lines that might contribute substantially to the structure factor .",
    "combination , separation and collapse of the loops were all observed .",
    "the disclinationloops appeared to experience minimal center - of - mass displacement and were relatively long - lived structures .",
    "type-1 lines took the form of single line segments or small partial loops virtually always connected to disclination  line segments and often forming bridges ( much like the @xmath84 intersections of @xcite ) between disclination  segments from the same or distinct loops .",
    "type-1 lines tended to fluctuate on much shorter time scales than disclinations , which seems reasonable given that the former are not topologically stable .",
    "one interesting observation is that type-1 linesoften appeared as precursors to or remnants of the motion of disclination  line segments .",
    "for example , the appearance of a type-1  line or several connected lines jutting out from a disclinationwas often followed by a kink or bend developing in the disclination  line at that point .",
    "similarly , the removal of kinks or bends often left behind type-1 lines  for some period of time .",
    "the type-1 lines  seemed to be initially defining and afterwards retaining a memory of the disclination  path .",
    "also , the emergence of distinct disclination  loops from localized tangles often included the breaking of numerous type-1  `` bonds '' between the loops .",
    "the monopoles  we observed fluctuated even more rapidly than the type-1 lines , although in many cases , their positions remained constant , on average , over relatively longer times . because of their fluctuations , it is difficult to make any reliable statements about specific monopole behaviors such as monopole - antimonopole annihilation , for example .",
    "we never observed monopole formation upon disclination  loop collapse , a result consistent with the presence of only twist disclination  loops .",
    "all of the above processes are best observed in the animations we provide on our web site @xcite .",
    "the total line length of disclination lines and type-1 lines as well as the number of monopoles is plotted in fig .",

    "we obtained curves for @xmath19 at times spanning the entire coarsening process .",
    "motivated by the dynamical scaling hypothesis eq .",
    "( [ corrscaling ] ) we attempted to collapse our data to a single curve with appropriate rescaling of distances . from @xmath86 ( in units of thousands of steps since the temperature quench ) until @xmath87 when nearly all of the defects disappeared , the @xmath19 curves for different times collapse to a single curve ( fig .",

    "[ corrsfig](b ) .",
    "our system is not large enough to extract a reliable power ",
    "law for the growth of @xmath7 .",
    "however , according to the dynamic scaling hypothesis the length @xmath7 defined by the above criterion should differ at most by prefactors or subdominant contributions at late times from other characteristic length scales of the system . for example , as we noted in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] the disclination line density should scale as @xmath89 . in fig .",

    "a least squares fit yields an exponent @xmath90 , _ consistent _ with dynamical scaling .",
    "however , the range of times over which coarsening occurs is too limited ( due to the small system size ) to allow us to fully assess the validity of the dynamical scaling hypothesis .",
    "similarly , while the collapse of the correlation function data to a single scaling curve is consistent with the predictions of dynamical scaling , the range of distances and times is too limited to provide more definitive support for the hypothesis .",

    "<S> phase  ordering dynamics in nematic liquid crystals has been the subject of much active investigation in recent years in theory , experiments and simulations . with a rapid quench from the isotropic to nematic phase a large number of topological defects are formed and dominate the subsequent equilibration process . </S>",
    "<S> we present here the results of a molecular dynamics simulation of the gay - berne  model of liquid crystals after such a quench in a system with 65536 molecules . </S>",
    "<S> twist disclination lines as well as type-1 lines  and monopoles  were observed . </S>",
    "<S> evidence of dynamical scaling was found in the behavior of the spatial correlation function and the density of disclination lines . </S>",
    "<S> however , the behavior of the structure factor provides a more sensitive measure of scaling , and we observed a crossover from a defect dominated regime at small values of the wavevector to a thermal fluctuation dominated regime at large wavevector . </S>"
