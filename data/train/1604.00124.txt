    "the classical and quantum correlation of a quantum state can be quantified by the notion of quantum discord .",
    "if @xmath0 is a bipartite quantum state , the quantum mutual information is defined by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the von neumann entropy of the quantum state .    to reveal the nature of quantum correlation , olliver and zurek @xcite proposed to use the entropy of measurement - based conditional density operators to study the classical correlation .",
    "the von neumann measurement is an ensemble of projectors @xmath3 such that @xmath4 where @xmath3 are mutually orthogonal idempotents . when the measurement @xmath5 is performed locally on one party of the system @xmath0 , the quantum state @xmath6",
    "is changed to @xmath7 with the probability @xmath8 .",
    "the quantum conditional entropy is given by @xmath9    the quantum mutual information with respect to @xmath5 is then defined as @xmath10 and the classical correlation is measured by the quantity @xcite @xmath11 then the quantum discord is simply defined as the difference @xmath12    as the quantum discord is given by the supremum over the set of von noumann measurements , mathematically the problem is equivalent to optimization of a multi - variable function with five parameters over a closed domain implicitly defined . in @xcite ,",
    "luo found the first exact formula for the bell diagonal state , which corresponds to a cross - section of the general 5-dimensional region by a 3-dimensional space .",
    "the problem for general x - states has been further studied in various works @xcite .",
    "notably ali et al @xcite gave the ara algorithm to calculate the quantum discord of the x - type state by reducing the problem to an optimization of certain three variable function .",
    "other methods @xcite have also been proposed to solve optimization of multi - variable functions in different parametrization and then claimed that in most cases the maximum value is given by two or three possible critical or special points .",
    "the quantum discord has also been studied using other more general povm measurements @xcite .",
    "so far the best record has been some reduction to extremal problems of two variable functions .",
    "however , these methods have not completely solved the problem of the quantum discord except luo s solution for the bell diagonal state @xcite which gives an _ exact _ or _ analytical _ formula for the quantum discord .",
    "in fact , most of the current methods are useful for many of the situations but not all cases .",
    "their main ideas are to solve the optimization problem by writing down a system of partial differential equations and then claimed that the solutions are given by those of the system .",
    "there are three questions needed to be addressed for these methods to be successful for the quantum discord .",
    "first of all , it is impossible to solve these systems of partial differential equations analytically .",
    "secondly , even if one manages to solve the system of the partial differential equations numerically , the solutions may still turn out to be some local extremal but the global ones , since most of the currently available methods did not discuss the situation on the boundary .",
    "therefore these differential equations could miss the important solutions of the quantum discord .",
    "thirdly , even the numerical solutions to those systems of partial differential systems could be problematic , since they are usually of high dimensional , and it was observed by huang @xcite that the computational cost could grow exponentially with the dimension of the hilbert space .",
    "the authors failed to locate a practical numerical method in the literature to solve this problem either , as they are optimization of multivariable functions and no satisfactory numerical methods are available for such complicated multivariable ( often ill - defined ) partial differential equations .",
    "for example , ex . 2 in sect .",
    "3 can not be solved by any of the currently available algorithms .",
    "in fact , its solution was only obtained by examining the graph of the quantum discord ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , thus its accuracy is at mercy of raw eyes .",
    "the reason behind this problem and trouble is perhaps that the present available methods more or less use the lagrange multiplier , which only gives necessary conditions for the interior critical points ( see any standard calculus book ) .",
    "those exceptional solutions such as ex . 2 in sect . 3 , on the other hand , appear not at interior points but on the boundary . to completely understand the physical meaning of the quantum discord , it is necessary to give a rigorous and satisfactory solution of the associated optimization problem .",
    "the goal of this paper is to solve the quantum discord of the general x - state for all situations on the whole domain in three steps .",
    "first , we propose a new method to reduce the associated optimization problem into that of a _ one - variable _ entropy - like function on the closed interval @xmath13 $ ] ( cf .",
    "theorem [ t:1 ] ) , which in principle solves the problem of the quantum discord .",
    "second , we give exact and analytical solutions for the general x - type state for several nontrivial regions of the parameters and prove rigorously that the answer is mostly given by the end - points of @xmath13 $ ] in theorem [ t:2 ] .",
    "third , for the exceptional cases not covered by the second step and when the maximum is at an interior point of @xmath14 , we have formulated an effective algorithm to pin down the exotic solutions using newton s formula ( see theorem [ th3 ] ) .",
    "we remark that the third step covers the situation when all previous methods can not solve the quantum discord .",
    "combining with the end - points , the iterative formula has completely resolved the problem of the quantum discord for the general x - type state . as an example to demonstrate the power of our method",
    ", we will solve the aforementioned ex .",
    "2 accurately ( by six simple iterations ) without resorting to its graph .",
    "we also compare our results with the formulas of @xcite , where the authors have used the concurrence to compute the quantum discord of rank two mixed states .",
    "it is verified that their formulas correspond to our special cases of either @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath17 be the standard pauli spin matrices such that @xmath18 .",
    "it is well - known that any two - qubit state is local unitary equivalent to the bloch form with diagonal quadratic terms in @xmath19 . in this paper , we restrict ourselves with the general x - type quantum state @xmath20 where @xmath21 $ ] and @xmath22 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath6 are given by @xmath23 therefore the quantum state @xmath6 is defined over the following closed region @xmath24 of @xmath25 : @xmath26 the manifold @xmath24 s boundary satisfies the following obvious constraints : @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",

    "any von neumann measurement can be written as @xmath37 for some @xmath38 , and each unitary matrix @xmath38 is parameterized up to a phase factor by the 4-dimensional unit sphere @xmath39 such that @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "after the measurement @xmath5 , the ensemble @xmath42 is given by .",
    "for @xmath40 , it follows from symmetry that @xmath43 and the expansion coefficients of @xmath44 lie on the unit 3-sphere , or more precisely the transition matrix @xmath45 .",
