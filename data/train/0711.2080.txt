    "the discovery of the narrow charm - strange mesons d@xmath7(2317)@xmath8 @xcite and d@xmath9(2460)@xmath8 @xcite has given special impetus to the calculation of hadron loop effects , since the loops are often cited as a possible reason for the surprisingly low masses of these mesons .",
    "this possibility is supported by the prediction that the corresponding @xmath10 quark model states have especially strong couplings to the open - flavor decay channels dk and d@xmath3k @xcite .",
    "( for discussions of the importance of hadronic loops effects in this and other contexts , including other heavy - quark mesons , see for example refs.@xcite . )",
    "the subject of valence - continuum couplings is also relevant to the x@xmath11 seen in @xmath12 @xcite , which may be dominantly a weakly - bound @xmath13 dd@xmath3 molecular state ; the size of the @xmath14 valence component present in this system has important implications for the properties of this state .",
    "( see ref.@xcite for a review of these and other recent developments in heavy - flavor hadrons . )",
    "since the open - flavor decay couplings of hadrons to two - body final states @xmath15 are large , one might anticipate that second - order decay loops , in which a hadron virtually decays to a two - body intermediate state and then reforms the original hadron ( @xmath16 ) , are also important effects .",
    "these second - order virtual processes give rise to mass shifts of the bare hadron states , and contribute continuum components to the physical hadron state vectors .",
    "a careful estimate of these mass shifts is of great interest , since they are usually not included in quark potential models and are only partially present in quenched lattice qcd , and may constitute important  systematic \" errors in the results .    in our initial study",
    "we develop a formalism for treating these loops effects , using results from our earlier studies of open - flavor decay amplitudes .",
    "in particular we give results for the loop - induced mass shifts and continuum amplitudes of hadrons , as well as the off - diagonal  spectroscopic mixing amplitudes \" induced by hadron loops between different external discrete hadron basis states .    as a numerical application we consider the charmonium system , and evaluate these mass shifts and continuum components for the lighter ( narrow ) charmonium states that lie below the open charm threshold .",
    "charmonium is especially attractive as a test system for studying loop effects because the low - lying spectrum is clear experimentally , with complete 1s , 1p and 2s multiplets , and all eight states in these multiplets are below the open - flavor decay threshold .",
    "( this implies that all mass shifts are negative , with no cancellations . ) in addition the charmonium system is only moderately relativistic , and the spectrum is quite well described by quenched potential models and lattice gauge theory .",
    "thus loop effects may be evaluated as ( possibly ) perturbative corrections to well understood @xmath14 potential model states , and the results may be contrasted with an unambiguous experimental spectrum .",
    "to incorporate hadron loop effects in the quark model , we model a physical hadron as a bare valence state @xmath17 augmented by two - hadron continuum components , |= | + _ _ |  .",
    "we assume that the hamiltonian for this combined system consists of a valence hamiltonian @xmath18 ( the quark model hamiltonian ) and an interaction @xmath19 which couples the valence and continuum sectors , = _ 0 + _  .",
    "we will evaluate the continuum components of the hadron state and their physical effects as a perturbation series in the valence - continuum coupling @xmath19 .",
    "our starting point for this perturbations series is the set of single valence hadron @xmath18 eigenstates ; a specific valence state is written as @xmath20 , and is assigned an @xmath18 eigenvalue of @xmath21 . since we normally work in the rest frame of the valence hadron , @xmath22 , this energy eigenvalue is just the rest mass @xmath23 of the bare valence quark model hadron .    the free two - hadron valence states which form our zeroth - order noninteracting continua are written as @xmath24 .",
    "the valence hamiltonian @xmath18 is understood to operate only between the constituents of b and c separately ; bc interactions , which are not treated here , would be incorporated in a separate two - hadron interaction hamiltonian .",

    "the usual discrete sum @xmath35 over intermediate states generalizes to a momentum - space integral over continuum states @xmath36 ; the result for a single bc channel is _ ^ ( ) = - _ n = - d^3p = - p _ _ + _ ^ d_p | h_fi|^2 -i \\ { d_p | h_fi|^2 } | _ _ = _ [ mshift ] where @xmath37 is the principal part integral .",

    "[ imm_rate ] the standard @xmath39 decay rate formula given in eq.(5 ) of ref.@xcite is indeed consistent with this relation .",

    "[ mshift_pint ] if one considers mixing between the valence state a and several continuum bc channels , the total mass shift at this ( leading ) order in the valence - continuum coupling is the sum of the individual mass shifts due to each channel .",

    "the result is a full propagator of the form    -i g(s ) = [ eq : bubble_sum ] where @xmath42 is the one particle irreducible self - energy of the meson in question .",
    "the propagator pole yields the meson mass shift and width .",

    "this can be approximately parameterized through a change in the quark mass or through a constant in the potential .    as as illustration of this theorem in a specific case , table  [ table_rel_mass_shifts ] shows the relative mass shifts of all the 1p charmonium levels due to their @xmath91p@xmath92 couplings to dd , dd@xmath3 and d@xmath3d@xmath3 meson loops , assuming that all the bare 1p @xmath14 masses are identical , the d and d@xmath3 meson masses are identical , and each flavor system has a common radial wavefunction .",

    "note that in some of the disfavored cases , such as @xmath96 , there is an almost complete cancellation of the final @xmath95 amplitude , due to destructive interference between the dd , dd@xmath3 and d@xmath3d@xmath3 loops .",

    "this expression is independent of the initial and final meson spin , we conclude that all mesons in a given ( assumed degenerate ) spin multiplet receive the same width and mass shift from the sum over all intermediate ( loop ) mesons in a given spin multiplet .",
    "furthermore , the spectroscopic mixing between mesons of different orbital angular momentum is zero when sums over spin multiplet intermediate states are carried out .",
    "( the external meson masses need not be identical to prove this result . ) finally , since these matrix elements drive nonperturbative mixing ( see the discussion following eq.[eq : bubble_sum ] ) , these conclusions also apply to nonperturbative mixing , in the absence of final state interactions .",
    "spectroscopic mixing between mesons with differing radial quantum numbers ( but identical otherwise ) is not zero in general .",
    "the size of this mixing is governed by the spatial dependence of the strong decay vertex .",
    "spectroscopic mixing has been studied previously by geiger and isgur@xcite , who considered the closure approximation , in which _ all _ loop mesons are assumed to be degenerate , not simply those in a spin multiplet .",
    "geiger and isgur used this approximation to explain the observed weakness of loop - driven ozi violation effects .",
    "we remark that the closure approximation implies that spectroscopic mixing between states with different radial quantum numbers is zero : under this approximation eq.[aeq ] simplifies to @xmath164 | { \\cal o}^2 | n_i j_i [ s_i \\ell_i\\rangle \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{\\langle 0 | { \\cal o}^2| 0 \\rangle}{(m_i - m_f)(m_i - \\bar{\\e})}\\ ; \\langle n_f j_f [ s_f \\ell_f ] |n_i j_i [ s_i",
    "\\ell_i ] \\rangle \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the last form follows from the spectator nature of the decay model .",
    "thus , if we impose the equality of all loop meson masses , _ all _ spectroscopic mixing is zero in the @xmath91p@xmath92 model , and in a wide range of related decay models .",
    "finally , the previous discussion remains largely unchanged when considering mixing between initially degenerate states . in this case",
    "one must diagonalize the matrix of second order matrix elements in the degenerate subspace@xcite , @xmath165 . under the conditions of the theorem , off - diagonal matrix element in @xmath166",
    "are zero when the meson spins or angular momenta differ .",
    "furthermore the diagonal matrix elements are identical .",
    "thus conclusions concerning mass shifts , widths , and small or zero spectroscopic mixing remain unchanged .",
