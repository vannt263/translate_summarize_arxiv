    "moreover @xmath27 are commutative in the classical sense .",
    "the case @xmath28 corresponds to the fermi statistics .",
    "it should be stressed that , for @xmath29 , the @xmath6-modification of the ( anti ) symmetrization operator is a strictly positive operator .",
    "therefore , unlike the classical bose and fermi cases , there are no commutation relations between the creation operators . for @xmath30 ,",
    "the @xmath6-fock space recovers the full fock space of voiculescu s free probability @xcite .",
    "for @xmath30 the @xmath6-gaussian random variables are distributed according to the semi - circle law @xmath31 when @xmath26 .",
    "the study of the noncommutative brownian motion @xmath32 was initiated in @xcite . for further generalizations of a noncommutative brownian motion , see @xcite .",
    "in particular , this setting gives rise to @xmath6-deformed versions of the stochastic integrals @xcite , with recent extensions to fourth moment convergence theorem @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention the work of bryc @xcite , where the laha - lukacs property for @xmath6-gaussian processes was shown .",
    "bryc proved that classical processes corresponding to operators which satisfy the @xmath6-commutation relations have linear regressions and quadratic conditional variances .",
    "after @xcite , a series of papers @xcite appeared , which studied discrete generalizations of the @xmath6-commutation relations .",

    "another generalization of the ccr and car was proposed in 2013 by bryc and ejsmont @xcite .",
    "they define a pair of non - commutative processes on a perturbed fock space with three parameters .",
    "both processes have the same univariate distributions , and satisfy a weak form of the polynomial martingale property .",
    "the processes give two non - equivalent fock - space realizations of the same classical markov process : the two - parameter bi - poisson processes introduced in @xcite , and constructed in @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to introduce an @xmath0-gaussian process on an @xmath0-fock space .",
    "our strategy is to replace the coxeter group of type a i.e.  the permutation group appearing in the sum by the coxeter group of type b. the coxeter group of type b can be written as @xmath39 and hence contains the permutation group as a subgroup .",
    "the parameter @xmath40 corresponds to the @xmath41 part and the parameter @xmath6 corresponds to @xmath17 part .",
    "thus our @xmath0-fock space gives the @xmath6-fock space when @xmath7 , and turns out to give the @xmath42-free probability space @xcite when @xmath8 and @xmath43 ( where @xmath44 .",
    "it would be worth mentioning that free probabilistic considerations of type b first appeared in a paper by biane , goodman and nica in @xcite .",
    "recently , connections between type b and infinitesimal free probability were put into evidence in @xcite .",
    "the commutation relation satisfied by the creation and annihilation operators on the @xmath0-fock space reads @xmath45 where @xmath4 is the number operator .",

    "this formula recovers the @xmath6 case in @xcite when @xmath7 .",
