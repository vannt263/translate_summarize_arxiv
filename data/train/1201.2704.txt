    "studies comparing embedded and open star cluster frequencies have found that the former type is more common ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the drop observed in the latter frequency has been interpreted as a result of _ infant mortality_. the paradigm is that most young clusters dissolve in the field because they can not return to dynamical equilibrium after the residual gas expulsion ( @xcite ) .",
    "a star formation efficiency ( sfe  the fraction of molecular cloud gas converted into stars ) higher than 50per cent is pointed out as the main factor to determine whether a star cluster will survive an abrupt gas removal @xcite",
    ". however , the observed sfe has been always less than 50per cent ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , @xcite showed that a single o - type star may inject , by means of winds and electromagnetic radiation , an energy higher than the cluster binding energy .",
    "this occurs on a time - scale shorter than the cluster crossing time ( @xmath0  the time - scale over which the system as a whole will respond to changes in the overall potential ) .",
    "therefore , other parameters such as the time - scale of gas removal , tidal radius and initial cluster distribution function must play some role in this picture @xcite . a low stellar velocity dispersion immediately before the onset of gas removal can be more important than the sfe for the cluster survival @xcite .",
    "in addition , even a cluster with low sfe ( @xmath120per cent ) might survive gas removal if it has a complex structure of subclusters .",
    "simulations by @xcite have pointed out that the subclusters in an embedded cluster are close to virial equilibrium , and that they are weakly affected by gas removal . in this case ,",
    "young clusters survive to _ infant mortality _ as bound systems .",
    "the merging of subclusters may form a more massive object with a much higher escape velocity @xcite . therefore",
    ", the low efficiency formation of clusters would be the result of another disruptive process , the tidal shocks from the dense star - forming regions . only clusters that migrate out of their natal environment in a short enough time - scale should survive .",
    "the disruptive processes ( residual gas expulsion and tidal shocks by the surrounding clouds ) cause an abrupt change in the gravitational potential that may lead an embedded star cluster to endure heavy stellar loss and expand to become a stellar association .",
    "however , the stars in these unbound systems are expected to keep a common proper motion by tens of millions of years @xcite .",
    "hence , distinction between star clusters ( bound systems ) and stellar associations may be difficult to establish for distant objects because of limitations to observe the proper motions of individual stars .",
    "therefore , @xcite proposed to use the ratio between stellar age and crossing time as a criterion to distinction .",
    "thus , unbound systems would have age/@xmath0@xmath21 and bound systems , age/@xmath0@xmath31 .",
    "examples of possible intermediate objects between embedded star clusters and stellar associations have been searched in order to determine constraints to the evolution of the embedded star clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "evidence of dissolving clusters with escaping stars can be provided by the analysis of extensions in radial profiles for large radii reflecting changes in the gravitational potential @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we analyze trumpler37 ( collinder439 ) using the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 photometry and determine some astrophysical parameters that characterize this object that might be evolving to an ob association .",
    "trumpler37 is embedded in the hii region ic1396  catalogued by @xcite as sh2 - 131  a cloud located close to the cepob2 association .",
    "fig.[fig : ic1396 ] shows a digitized sky survey ( dss ; @xcite ) image of the complex . the brightest star in the complex is hr8281 ( hd206267 ) , a spectroscopic binary of o6.5v((f))+o9:v types that belongs to the multiple system ads15184 @xcite .",
    "this complex also includes many dark nebulae and substructures , remarkably the elephant trunk nebula ( ic1396a ) with many young stellar objects ( e.g. @xcite ) . in a study by @xcite about the bright - rimmed clouds in ic1396",
    "it was estimated a gas and dust mass _",
    "m@xmath7_=12@xmath810@xmath9m@xmath10 for the whole complex .",
    "there is some spread in the distance estimates for trumpler37/ic1396 , e.g. 705pc @xcite ; 860pc @xcite ; 798pc @xcite and 835pc @xcite .",
    "these values imply a mean _ d@xmath10_=800@xmath1160pc , which we adopt hereafter .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in sect.[sec : cmd ] we build colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) and a colour - colour diagram to estimate some astrophysical parameters of trumpler37 . in sect.[sec : rdp ] we analyze the radial density profiles ( rdps ) and derive structural parameters . in sect.[sec : dis ] we discuss the results and use diagnostic diagrams to compare the trumpler37 parameters with those of a template . in sect.[sec :",
    "con ] we provide the concluding remarks of this work .",
    "photometry of trumpler37 in the 2mass @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 bands was extracted from the catalogue ii/246 @xcite available in the vizier data base @xcite in a circular area of radius 350arcmin centred on hr8281 ( table[tab : tr37f ]  coordinates from the simbad astronomical data base ; @xcite ) for a total of 1361458 stars . as quality constraint , we only considered stars with photometric errors @xmath120.1mag in each band .",

    "j@xmath8(j@xmath13h ) _ and _ j@xmath8(j@xmath13k@xmath14 ) _ cmds for the trumpler37 stellar content and field stars for an offset equal area .",
    "this is simply for comparison purposes , since the decontamination for field stars was based on a large field within the range of @xmath15=150@xmath13350arcmin , together with an outlying circular area at a distance of 13.82@xmath16 and a radius of 100arcmin centred on @xmath17=21@xmath1851@xmath1900@xmath20 and @xmath21=+44@xmath1600@xmath2200@xmath23 to improve statistics .",
    "the membership of stars of the cluster was determined by comparison of the photometric properties of the stars in the offset field and in the cluster ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the decontamination algorithm works as follows :    1 .",
    "a spatial extraction of radius 24.5arcmin , large enough to be statistically representative of colours and magnitude of trumpler37 , was chosen by eye .",
    "three - dimensional cmds @xmath4@xmath8_(j@xmath13h)_@xmath8_(j@xmath13k@xmath14 ) _ were build for this region and for the field .",
    "the step along each dimension was @xmath24=1.0 and @xmath25@xmath13@xmath26=@xmath27@xmath13@xmath28=0.2 . for each cluster cmd cell",
    "we modeled the contamination based on the comparison field .",
    "photometric uncertainties were taken into account , in the sense that what we computed was the probability of a given star to be found in a cell ( this minimizes the difference of the error function between the borders of the cells ) .",
    "given the probabilities of all stars , we obtained the density of stars in each cell .",
    "we carried out this procedure for the object and comparison field cells .",
    "subsequently , the comparison field density was converted back into an integer number of stars , which was subtracted from the cluster extraction , on a cell - by - cell basis , resulting the number of member stars in a given cell , @xmath29 .",
    "variations in the cell positioning corresponding to 1/3 of the adopted cell size in each dimension were allowed , such that we ran 243 different setups .",
    "each setup produced a total number of member stars , @xmath30 , from which we computed the expected total number of member stars @xmath31 by averaging out @xmath32 over all combinations .",
    "the stars were ranked according to the number of times they survived the 243 runs , and only the @xmath31 highest ranked stars were considered cluster members and transposed to the respective decontaminated cmd ( bottom panels of fig.[fig : tr37_cmd ] ) .",
    "only 2267 from the 7972 stars that were within the circle of radius 24.5arcmin have survived the decontamination procedure .",
    "the difference between the expected number of field stars ( sometimes fractional ) and the number of stars effectively subtracted ( integer ) from each cell is the subtraction efficiency , which summed over all cells resulted 94.6@xmath110.5per cent .",
    "the resulting decontaminated _",
    "j@xmath8(j@xmath13h ) _ and _ j@xmath8(j@xmath13k@xmath14 ) _ cmds of trumpler37 are shown in fig.[fig : tr37_cmd ] .",
    "they reveal a prominent gap between ms and pms stars ( bottom panels in fig.[fig : tr37_cmd ] ) even wider than that of the probable young dissolving cluster vdb92 @xcite .",
    "we found that the 1myr padova main - sequence ( ms ) isochrone @xcite and the pre - main sequence ( pms ) isochrones @xcite for the ages 0.2 , 1 and 5myr are the ones that best describe the sequences in the decontaminated cmds .",
    "since the 2mass photometric uncertainties do not allow to detect metallicity differences , all the adopted isochrones have solar - metallicity , suitable for the galactic disc in general . for the purposes of this work we adopted 5myr as the age of trumpler37 ( table[tab : tr37f ] ) .",
    "@xcite estimated the absorption of fourteen bright ob stars of trumpler37 and suggested that the reddening towards them appears to be constant and of foreground origin .",
    "we used their mean absorption @xmath33=1.80@xmath110.48mag and a distance from the sun _",
    "d@xmath10_=800pc ( sect.[sec : in ] ) as constraints to set the isochrones ( fig.[fig : tr37_cmd ] ) .",
    "we remark that in such a young cluster , the star formation process is expected to extend over a time comparable to the cluster age ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it may be very difficult to disentangle the age spread and the differential reddening , especially when photometry is the only available information @xcite .",
    "table[tab : tr37f ] shows the coordinates and fundamental parameters of trumpler37 .",
    "we applied the relations given by @xcite to the magnitudes of the pms stars of our sample stars using the reddening values of table[tab : tr37f ] in order to build an intrinsic colour - colour diagram _",

    "two long - dashed lines parallel to the reddening vector are shown in fig.[fig : tr37_2cd ] , such that stars with colours outside and to the right of the delimiting bands are sources with infrared excess ( a disk emission indicator ) .",

    "the limits of these filters do not require high precision and were selected by eye .",
    "they are applied to the raw cmd within the range @xmath15=0@xmath23@xmath13350@xmath23 to minimise contamination of non - cluster stars before building the stellar rdps ( sect.[sec : rdp ] ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in order to locate trumpler37 in an evolutionary sequence of star clusters we built diagnostic diagrams ( fig.[fig : tr37_dia ] ) comparing its parameters to those of objects analyzed in previous studies .",
    "the comparison sample consists of :    * the structurally normal open clusters within a wide age range ( 70myr to 7gyr ) m26 , ngc2287 , m48 , m93 , ngc5822 , ngc3680 , ic4651 , m67 and ngc188 , plus the populous open clusters ngc2477 and ngc2516 @xcite ; * ngc4755 , with residual stellar infrared excess emission and an age of 14myr @xcite ; * the very young and dynamically evolved cluster ngc6611 , with an age of 1.3myr @xcite ; * bochum1 , with an age of 9myr , a star cluster remnant that might be evolving into an ob association , and the bound cluster ngc6823 with an age of 4myr @xcite ; * the dissolving young cluster ngc2244 , with an age of 3myr and a candidate to ordinary young open cluster ngc2239 with an age of 5myr @xcite ; * the dissolving clusters collinder197 and vdb92 , both with an age of 5myr @xcite ; * the open cluster teutsch74 ( sect.[sec : teu74 ] ) ; * and trumpler37 itself .",
    "fig.[fig : tr37_dia ] , panels ( a ) and ( b ) show the dependence of the core radius on age and galactocentric distance .",
    "panels ( c ) and ( d ) do the same for the rdp radius .",
    "finally , panels ( e ) and ( f ) show the dependence of the rdp radius on mass and core radius .",
    "young clusters ( @xmath12100myr ) and old clusters ( @xmath3100myr ) are represented by different symbols .",
    "although the inner region of trumpler37 has been fitted by an isothermal model ( sect.[sec : rdp ] ) , the object does not present typical parameters of a young star cluster .",
    "it has a rdp radius much larger than the fitting radius ( both are represented in fig.[fig : ic1396 ] and fig.[fig : tr37_dia ] ) , which is larger than bochum1 , an association that is somewhat older and more distant from the solar circle .",
    "thus , the extended nature of trumpler37 can be attributed to tidal effects and molecular cloud fragmentation .",
    "evidence of the former process is that _",
    "r@xmath35_@xmath36_r@xmath37 _ , and of the latter is that there are many brcs in the area of trumpler37 .",
    "note that the rdp radius might match the tidal radius as long as trumpler37 is closer to the sun ( @xmath1730pc ) or has a larger mass ( @xmath15600m@xmath10 ) .",
    "panel ( b ) suggests a weak relation of the core radii of the clusters with the galactocentric distances , but with a significant spread .",
    "in addition , panel ( f ) shows a scale relation between the rdp and core radii given by the equation _",
    "r@xmath35_=@xmath38 , fitted with a least - squares routine with errors in both coordinates .",
    "most objects follow this relation , except trumpler37 , bochum1 , vdb92 and ngc2244 which were not included in the fit .",
    "all of them present evidence of dissolving systems . on the other hand",
    ", the inner region of trumpler37 , delimited by the fitting radius , seems to follow this relation , so it might survive as a bound core of an expanding association .",
    "in the present paper we analyzed trumpler37 which is embedded in the hii region complex ic1396 .",
    "we used field - star decontaminated 2mass photometry to build colour - magnitude diagrams and stellar radial density profiles in order to find fundamental and structural parameters .",
    "the cmd of trumpler37 shows a detached pms suggesting sequential star formation and its rdp shows a core that follows a king - like model surrounded by several small subclusters with some deeply embedded stars .",
    "trumpler37 has a low star formation efficiency ( @xmath110per cent ) and age/@xmath0@xmath21 , typical of objects that do not survive as bound systems .",
    "in fact , it has parameters similar to those of the objects classified as dissolving systems in previous studies .",
    "note that these are values for the whole complex .",
    "the star formation efficiency can be higher in the clumps of the molecular cloud , and age/@xmath0@xmath31 in the inner region of trumpler37 which is fitted by an isothermal sphere model .",
