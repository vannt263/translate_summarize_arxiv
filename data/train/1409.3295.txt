    "<S> , the g - factor is equally averaged over all valleys , and no g - factor anisotropy can be resolved . however , when an electric field is oriented along a valley axis ( @xmath56100@xmath57 for si ) , the valley degeneracy is partially lifted , and electrons preferentially fill valleys oriented along the electric field . </S>",
    "<S> this changes the effective g - factor and induces an anisotropy in the stark parameter @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropy is most pronounced when the electric field is oriented along a valley axis . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , application of an electric field in the \\{111 } axes would result in no valley repopulation , since it makes the same angle with all valleys . </S>",
    "<S> this orientation is not accessible in our device geometry , but we were able to apply a @xmath25110@xmath26 $ ] oriented electric field , and , as expected , the spin - orbit anisotropy became small as shown in table 1 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is through the stark shift that @xmath12 noise can decohere spins and we note the existence of esr transitions insensitive to this noise . from eq.(1 ) , we infer that decoherence from @xmath12 noise can differ substantially for the two donor nuclear spin projections , @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , @xmath14 can be tuned such that the first two terms cancel , leading to a transition insensitive to @xmath12 . due to the dependence of @xmath33 on the orientation of @xmath12 , these noise - suppression points vary with the direction of @xmath12 , and no single @xmath14 </S>",
    "<S> can cancel all randomly oriented electric - field noise . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , noise suppression points are most effective in situations where the primary source of noise ( and thus the direction of @xmath12 ) is known , such as in gated donor architectures </S>",
    "<S> .    in the simplest picture , electric - field noise ( which is presumably small ) should not contribute to decoherence , since the stark effect is quadratic . </S>",
    "<S> however , this changes dramatically when a large dc electric field ( present in gate - addressed architectures ) or strain is applied . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we consider this field coming from strain @xcite , inducing a shift in the esr frequency by modulating the hyperfine interaction@xcite and causing valley repopulation@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the stark shift in the presence of strain is given as @xmath58(\\vec{e}^{2}+2\\vec{e } \\cdot \\vec{e}_{strain})/\\hbar,\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the effective electric field due to strain . </S>",
    "<S> when electric - field noise , @xmath60 , is small , the @xmath61 term is negligible whereas the @xmath62 term can be large . using data in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate that a strain of @xmath63 is equivalent to an effective electric field of @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> we hereafter refer to strain in units of @xmath65 , which corresponds to the strength of @xmath59 .    to investigate strain we use unipolar ( positive bias ) pulses , instead of the bipolar pulses used to gather the data for fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2 ] . bipolar pulses cancel the linear term of eq.(3 ) whereas unipolar pulses lead to a broadening of the esr line and loss of signal when internal strains are inhomogeneous across the spin ensemble . despite this </S>",
    "<S> broadening , data were taken using unipolar pulses with amplitudes of up to @xmath24 ( supplemental material ) . </S>",
    "<S> these data indicate that strain is approximately @xmath66 in our wafers , and the signal loss indicates that the strain is primarily random . </S>",
    "<S> we compare this to a similar sample ( 10 @xmath2 m p doped epitaxial layer of @xmath0si ) reported @xcite with an electron nuclear double resonance ( endor ) linewidth of 100 khz . assuming that broadening of the endor line is due primarily to strain , this linewidth corresponds to an @xmath59 distribution spanning @xmath67 , comparable to our results . for these strains , </S>",
    "<S> the spins sensitivity to electric - field noise , @xmath68 , can be large . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath60 limited coherence time ( @xmath69 ) is inversely proportional to @xmath70 @xcite so electric - field sources of decoherence can be substantial . while the @xmath60 contribution to the coherence time will vary from system to system , we calculate ( using @xcite ) that for @xmath71 of noise on our cpw center pin , @xmath69 would be limited to @xmath72 in the devices used in these experiments devices with gates more strongly coupled to the donors would have their @xmath69 affected more severely .    </S>",
    "<S> internal strains can also lead to errors in measuring @xmath33 , even when using bipolar pulses . </S>",
    "<S> this is because @xmath33 depends on the direction of the total electric field which includes @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath59 is random , there is uncertainty in the actual direction of the total electric field relative to @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> care was taken to minimize strain when mounting the devices , but not all strain can be avoided and in our devices we found that @xmath59 was larger than the applied electric fields . </S>",
    "<S> the errors arising from strain should become small as @xmath12 becomes large , so data taken at higher bias voltages were weighted more heavily when fitting the model . for our samples we estimate that the magnitude of @xmath33 can be underestimated by up to a factor of 2.5 for the @xmath25100@xmath26 $ ] data .    taking into account strain , </S>",
    "<S> we quantitatively compute the sensitivity of spins to electric - field noise ( @xmath68 ) . </S>",
    "<S> for the simple case , where the strain is uniform and oriented in the same direction as the @xmath60 , we plot @xmath73 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3](a ) ( assuming @xmath59 is @xmath66 ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath12 noise suppression points appear as minima in @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> this case applies to bulk @xmath0si crystals where the strain distribution can be small ( @xmath74 ) and single - donor systems .    </S>",
    "<S> we recognize that in devices containing ensembles of spins , randomly oriented strain leads to a distribution in @xmath33 over the ensemble , washing out noise suppression effects . </S>",
    "<S> assuming random strain of order @xmath66 , comparable to the strain in our samples , @xmath68 should on average decrease by a factor of 5 for one hyperfine line compared to the other . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to an increase in @xmath69 by a factor of 25 ( because @xmath75 @xcite ) as shown in the supplemental information . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that , even with the simple approach of choosing the optimal field and hyperfine line , one can substantially suppress @xmath12 noise .    </S>",
    "<S> we propose applying a large uniform external strain or dc electric field as a remedy to random strain effects . </S>",
    "<S> this external field adds to @xmath59 such that the total field becomes nearly uniform . </S>",

    "<S> however , one must take care when orientating the external strain . </S>",
    "<S> if it is large and oriented perpendicular to the electric - field noise , a slight deviation from perfect alignment can lead to substantial decoherence due to the linear term in eq.(3 ) . applying strain perpendicular to the @xmath12 noise will suppress the linear term and protect the donor spin from electric - field induced decoherence . </S>",
