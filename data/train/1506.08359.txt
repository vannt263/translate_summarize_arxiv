    "gravitational microlensing is an astronomical phenomenon in which the light of a background star is magnified due to passing through the gravitational field of a foreground object by producing distorted images @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon has many applications in detecting extra - solar planets , measuring the mass of isolated stars , studying the stellar atmospheres , etc .",
    "( see , e.g. mao 2012,gaudi 2012 ) .",
    "one of features of gravitational microlensing is that it causes a net polarization for source stars @xcite .",
    "there is a local polarization over the star surface due to the electron scattering in its atmosphere @xcite . since , these local polarizations have symmetric orientations with respect to the source center , the net polarization of a distant star is zero .",
    "some effects can break this symmetry and create a net polarization for distant stars such as circum - stellar disk of dust grains around the central star @xcite , stellar spots , magnetic field and lensing effect . during a microlensing event ,",
    "the circular symmetry of source star is broken and result is a net polarization for the source star . measuring polarization during microlensing events helps us to evaluate the finite source effect , the einstein radius and the limb - darkening parameters of source star @xcite .    in single microlensing events",
    ", the polarimetric signal reaches to its maximum amount , i.e. about one percent , when the impact parameter of the source center i.e. @xmath0 reaches to @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the projected source radius , normalized to the einstein radius @xcite .",
    "but , the probability of happening a microlensing event with an impact parameter as smaller as @xmath3 is low . whereas , in binary microlensing events whenever the source star crosses the caustic curve the polarization signal as high as one percent can be obtained @xcite . indeed , the point - like caustic in a single lens converts to some closed curves in binary lensing which is extended about the angular einstein radius ( see e.g. schneider and weiss 1986 ) .",
    "consequently , whenever the source crosses the caustic curves , due to the high gradient of magnification and polarization , the anomalies over the source surface can be resolved through photometric or polarimetric observations .",
    "one of the second - order perturbations over the source surface is the stellar spot .",
    "indeed , a magnetic field over the source surface generates convective motions which make a temperature contrast with the source surface temperature , so - called as a stellar spot ( e.g. berdyugina 2005 ) .",
    "a stellar spot produces a polarization signal through two channels ( i ) zeeman effect due to its magnetic field and ( ii ) circular symmetry breaking of the source surface brightness due to the temperature contrast with the host star . comparing these two effects",
    ", the first one has a dominant contribution in polarization signal .",
    "a stellar spot over the source surface disturbs the light and polarimetric curves of microlensing events . detecting and characterizing stellar spots through their effects on the photometric light curves during microlenising events due to a point - like lens and binary lenses",

    ", we investigate detecting and characterizing stellar spots over the source surface through their effects on the _ polarimetric curves _ in microlensing events .",
    "although , most spot - induced polarization signals from the galactic bulge sources are too weak to be detected by themselves , the lensing effect can magnify these signals and makes them be observable . studying spot - induced perturbations in polarimetric microlensing due to a point - like lens",
    "was first investigated by sajadian and rahvar ( 2014 ) .",
    "they also noticed that there is an orthogonal relation between the polarization orientation and the astrometric centroid shift vector in microlensing events due to a point - like lens and binary lenses except near the fold of caustic and investigated the advantages of this orthogonality for detecting the anomalies of the source surface . here , we study detecting and characterizing the stellar spot through polarimetric microlensing in caustic - crossing .",
    "we first explore the characteristics of spot - induced perturbations on the polarization degree and its orientation in binary microlensing events .",
    "then , by performing a monte carlo simulation from binary microlensing events with spotted sources during caustic - crossing we estimate the probability of detecting a stellar spot through polarimetric microlensing during caustic - crossing and the number of events .    in the following section , we study the stellar spot effects on ( i ) magnification factor , ( ii ) polarization degree and ( iii ) polarization orientations . in section ( [ mont ] )",
    "the detectability of the polarimetric and photometric deviations due to the stellar spots in microlensing events during caustic - crossing is studied by performing a monte carlo simulation .",
    "we explain the results in the last section .",
    "in order to describe the polarized light we use the stokes parameters of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "these parameters describe the total intensity , two components of linear polarization and circular polarization over the source surface , respectively @xcite .",
    "the polarization degree @xmath8 and the polarization angles @xmath9 and @xmath10 as functions of stokes parameters are given by @xcite : @xmath11 by considering the linear polarization of light scattering in a stellar atmosphere , the circular polarization is zero @xmath12 . in microlensing events , the stokes parameters during the magnification are given by : @xmath13 where @xmath2 is the projected source radius which is normalized to the einstein radius , @xmath14 is the distance from the centre of the stellar disk to each element over the source surface which is normalized to the source radius , @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the azimuthal angle between the lens - source connection line and the line from the center of coordinate to each element over the source surface , @xmath17 is the distance of each projected element over the source surface with respect to the lens position , @xmath0 is the impact parameter of the source center and magnification factor for simple microlensing is @xmath18 .",
    "the amounts of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , as the total and polarized light intensities , by assuming the electron scattering in spherically isotropic scattering atmosphere of an early - type star on the emitted light , were evaluated by chandrasekhar ( 1960 ) as follows : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the source intensity at the disk center , @xmath23 and @xmath24 @xcite . here , we focus on the giant sources with finite size effect for which the limb - darkening coefficients are different a bit . for these sources",
    ", we set @xmath25 @xcite and @xmath26 .",
    "figure ( [ fig1 ] ) represents @xmath19 ( red solid line ) , @xmath20 ( green dashed line ) , normalized to the intensity of the source at the disk center , versus the distance from the source center normalized to the source radius i.e. @xmath14 . according to this figure , considering the limb - darkening effect the total intensity @xmath19 decreases a bit whereas the polarized intensity @xmath20 increases from the center to the limb . if there is no lensing effect i.e. @xmath27 , the local polarization degree is equal to @xmath28 . here , over the star surface",
    "the polarization degrees enhance from the center to limb as shown in figure ( [ fig1 ] ) with blue dotted line . also , the polarization vector in each point of the source surface is tangent to a circle whose center coincides to the source center and passes from that point .",
    "the overall polarization signal of an ideal source is zero , because of the symmetric orientations of local polarizations with respect to the source center .",
    "now , let us consider a stellar spot on the source surface . to specify the spot in our simulation , we use four parameters for spots as : ( i ) the size of spot , ( ii ) the location of spot on the source star , ( iii ) its magnetic field and ( iv ) the temperature contrast of the spot with respect to the host star .",
    "these parameters are not completely independent and there is a correlation relation between the magnetic field of the spot and its temperature contrast with respect to the host star @xcite . also , we consider the following limitations for modeling the spot polarization : ( i ) there is one circular spot on the source surface , ( ii ) the magnetic field over the spot has a constant amount and its direction is radial , ( iii ) the magnetic field is high enough to ignore the hanle effect ( see e.g. stenflo ( 2013 ) ) , ( iii ) we take the minle - eddington model for the stellar atmosphere in which the line source function is linear versus the optical depth , ( iv ) the ratio of the line and continuous absorption coefficients is constant , ( v ) the intensity over the spot is constant . also we assume a black body radiation for the spot and its host star to indicate their intensities and finally ( vi ) we estimate the broad band stokes intensities by integrating over the wavelength pass band , taking into account the stokes intensities in a spectral line .",
    "the radius of the spot is @xmath29 and the angular radius of spot in coordinate located at the centre of source star is given by @xmath30 .",
    "we preform a coordinate transformation to obtain the position of spot on the lens coordinate set two axes of which describe the sky plane . in this regard",
    ", we use the two rotation angles of @xmath31 around @xmath32-axis and @xmath33 around @xmath34-axis .",
    "the more details about modeling of the spot in our simulation can be found in sajadian and rahvar ( 2014 ) .    to calculate the modified stokes parameters , we integrate over the source surface from the stokes intensities . since , the stokes intensities over a given spot are different from those over the other points of the source surface , we take into account the combination of the terms from spot and source star , using a step function .",
    "the overall stokes parameters @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are given by : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is that step function which is equal to one within the spot area and zero for the other points .",
    "@xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the stokes intensities over the spot which are measured according to the spot position , it magnetic field and its intensity .",
    "indeed , the magnetic field through the zeeman effect on the spectral lines causes a net polarization for the spot which is mostly circular ( see e.g. illing et al . 1975 ) .",
    "the more details about calculating these stokes intensities by considering the mentioned limitations over the source and its atmosphere are brought in appendix section .",
    "the spot - induced perturbations on the magnification factor , polarization degree and polarization angles are explained in the following subsections respectively .",
    "the spot - induced perturbation on microlensing light curve due to a point - like lens was first investigated by heyrovsk and sasselov ( 2000 ) .",
    "they concluded that the photometric spot effect can numerically reach the fractional spot radius .",
    "then , the feasibility of spot detection , studying the spot - induced perturbations in binary microlensing events during the caustic crossing and delectability of spot in different wavelengths have been discussed in details by a number of authors @xcite .    to calculate the magnification factor of a spotted source",
    ", we assume that the intensity of the spot , i.e. @xmath44 , is almost constant over the spot area .",
    "hence , we can re - write the fourth modified stokes parameter @xmath38 ( in equation [ spott ] ) , by factoring out @xmath44 as : @xmath45 where we define @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the source intensity at the geometrical location of the spot center i.e. @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the stokes parameter due to the source without any spot , given by equation ( [ tsparam ] ) and @xmath51 is the stokes parameter of the spot itself considering @xmath47 as its intensity . integrating is done over the source area . in that case , the magnification factor of a spotted source is given by : @xmath52 where the index @xmath53 of the stokes parameters refers to the ones without lensing effect .",
    "@xmath54 is the magnification factor of the source without any spot , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the magnification factor @xmath57 up to the third order in @xmath58 in terms of un - perturbed magnification factor @xmath59 and perturbation terms is given by : @xmath60.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , a spot on the surface of source star has two effects : ( i ) decreasing the baseline flux of the source which enhances the magnification factor by @xmath61 and ( ii ) decreasing the magnified light which decreases the magnification factor about @xmath62 .",
    "before the spot reaches to the caustic curve , the magnification factor enhances due to the first effect .",
    "when the spot light is being magnified due to passing over the caustic line or approaching to the lens position , the second effect dominates and the total magnification factor decreases . when these two effects have the same amounts i.e. @xmath63 , the perturbation terms vanish . in this time , @xmath64 where @xmath65 which means that the magnification factor of the source is equal to the magnification factor of the spot itself .",
    "this time does not depend on the relative difference in the intensity of source and spot i.e. @xmath66 and just depends on the spot area and its location with respect to the lens or caustic line .",
    "if the source radius and the lens position ( or the caustic configuration in binary lensing ) in this time are deduced from the photometric observations , we can assign the magnification factor of the spot itself which helps us to characterize the spot properties .      here",
    ", we investigate the spot - induced perturbations on polarization degree during a microlensing event , some prospects are explained in the following .",
    "\\(a ) berdyugina ( 2005 ) noticed that there are some correlation relations between the spot parameters such as its magnetic field , temperature contrast and the source photosphere temperature .",
    "she plotted the data of magnetic field measurement @xmath67 and the spot temperature contrast @xmath68 versus the photosphere temperature @xmath69 for some active dwarfs and giants and concluded that the hotter giants have the weaker magnetic field whereas their spots have the higher temperature contrast .",
    "we can fit two useful functions to her data which are given by : @xmath70 according to these relations , for a source star with a constant photosphere temperature , the cooler stellar spots have the stronger magnetic fields and as a result the higher polarization signals .    on the other hand ,",
    "the stokes intensities of the spot , i.e. @xmath71 ( for @xmath72 ) , are proportional to the continuum , local intensity of the spot , i.e. @xmath73 , ( for more details see appendix section ) .",
    "but , in the microlensing observations from the sources in the galactic bulge , we receive the total flux of the source and its spot .",
    "hence , the darker spots have the smaller contributions to the total flux whereas they intrinsically have larger polarization signals due to the stronger magnetic fields . here",
    ", we investigate which of these two effects , i.e. ( 1 ) the spot magnetic field and ( 2 ) the spot flux contrast , has more contribution in the polarimetric perturbations in microlensing events .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for this aim , in figure [ fig2a ]",
    "we show a polarimetric microlensing event affected by the source spot .",
    "we consider a giant star as the source with the parameters @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "also we assume that the source has a spot with the parameters @xmath77 and @xmath78 , chosen according to the equations ( [ bt ] ) .",
    "in addition , we consider a cooler spot with a stronger magnetic field and the hotter spot with a weaker magnetic field .",
    "the light curves and polarimetric curves for these three cases are shown in left and right panels of this figure .",
    "the source ( black circle ) and its spot located over the source surface , caustic curve ( black curve ) and source center trajectory projected in the lens plane ( red dash - dotted line ) are shown with an inset in the left - hand panel .",
    "the thinner lines in right panel show the intrinsic polarization signals of the spotted source .",
    "the simple models without spot effect are shown by red solid lines .",
    "the photometric and polarimetric residuals with respect to the simple models are plotted in bottom panels .",
    "note that the polarimetric residuals are the residual in the polarization degree without considering the polarization angles i.e. @xmath79 and the absolute value of the residual in the polarization vector i.e. @xmath80 whose definition is brought in equation ( [ delp ] ) .",
    "the parameters used to make this microlensing event can be found in table ( [ tab1 ] ) . to calculate the magnification factor of each element over the source star , we use the adaptive contouring algorithm @xcite . according to this figure three spots with different magnetic fields and temperature contrasts have almost the same intrinsic polarization signals and as a result the same polarimetric deviations in the polarimetric microlensing .",
    "hence , these two effects whereas act reversely have the same strengths .",
    "the photometric signature of the spot depends on the temperature contrast and enhances with increasing it .",
    "the polarization signal of spot maximizes when the spot is crossing the caustic curve .",
    "if the spot is located on the source edge and the source is entering into the caustic from that edge ( near the spot ) , the spot - induced perturbation is so higher than when that source is coming out from that edge . because , in the first case the light from the other points over the source surface is not magnified .",
    "accordingly , in the first caustic - crossing of figure [ fig2a ] , the spot - induced perturbation is higher than that in the second one .",
    "also , the duration of the polarimetric signal depends on the location of spot with respect to the caustic line , the size of spot and its host star and it does not depend on the temperature contrast and the magnetic field .",
    "\\(b ) the effect of the projection angle @xmath31 on the spot - induced polarimetric deviation : the amount of the circular stokes intensity in a spectral line due to zeeman effect is proportional to @xmath81 and as a result increases by decreasing @xmath31 , whereas the linear stokes intensities in a spectral line are proportional to @xmath82 and decrease by decreasing @xmath31 ( see equations [ a7 ] and [ a5 ] in appendix section ) .",
    "hence , the polarization signals due to face - on spots are more circular and those due to spots with larger projection angles are more linear .",
    "as mentioned in the appendix section , the broadband circular stokes intensity is so smaller than that in a spectral line by one order of magnitude whereas the linear ones have almost the same amounts as those in a spectral line .",
    "because , the circular polarization in a spectral line has an anti - symmetric shape with respect to the wavelength .",
    "consequently , stellar spots with the smaller projection angle @xmath31 have lower polarized stokes intensities .    in figure",
    "[ fig2b ] a polarimetric microlensing event of a spotted source is represented with three different amounts of the projection angle @xmath31 . according to this figure , the intrinsic polarization signal due to the spot without lensing for @xmath83 ( about @xmath84 per cent ) is so smaller than that with @xmath85 ( about @xmath86 per cent ) , shown with thin , straight lines .",
    "on the other hand , increasing the projection angle @xmath31 decreases the spot area and the total intensity considering limb - darkening effect and as a result increases @xmath38 ( which decreases the polarization signal ) . therefore , by increasing the projection angle , the polarization signal due to stellar spots without lensing increases and then decreases .",
    "the polarization signal without lensing due to the spot with @xmath87 is equal to @xmath88 per cent , lower than that with @xmath85 .",
    "however , the deviations in the polarimetric microlensing due to the spot with @xmath87 is a bit larger than that due to the spot with @xmath85 which is due to the finite size effect .",
    "the larger projection angle , the smaller area of the spot . in microlensing events",
    ", finite size effect always shrinks sharp signals .    in the photometric curves ,",
    "increasing the projection angle @xmath31 decreases the spot - induced photometric signal . because , the spot area decreases by increasing the projection angle by @xmath89 which decreases the spot - induced perturbation signal .",
    "however , the total intensity decreases from the center to the limb of the source star due to limb - darkening effect ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) , but this effect is so smaller than the first one .",
    "if the area of the spot is fixed by considering the limb - darkening effect , the photometric signal due to the spot does not change significantly ( see e.g. heyrovsk & sasselov ( 2000 ) ) .",
    "therefore , the spots located at the source center make higher photometric signals as shown in figure [ fig2b ] .",
    "this points was also noticed by hendry et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "\\(c ) there is a partial degeneracy for indicating the spot size and its temperature difference with respect to the host star from the photometric deviations .",
    "however , these two factors are not completely degenerate . because by increasing the spot size the finite size effect becomes important .",
    "this effect strongly alters the shape of the spot - induced signals . whereas , increasing the spot temperature contrast only increases the perturbation signals and does not change the shape of the signals .",
    "hence , these two effect are partially degenerate in the photometric measurements .",
    "although , two degenerate spots with the same photometric deviations have different , intrinsic polarization signals , but by considering two different magnetic fields , they can have the same polarization signal and be polarimetrically degenerate . in figure [ fig2c ] , we make two microlensing events with spotted sources in which the spots have the same positions but different sizes , temperature differences and magnetic fields .",
    "these spots have the same , intrinsic polarization signals .",
    "these two events have the same light and polarimetric curves and are degenerate .",
    "however , in the photometric curve degeneracy is between the spot size and its temperature contrast .",
    "therefore , we can not uniquely extract the spot properties from the photometric or polarimetric deviations .",
    "\\(d ) we investigate the finite size effect on the photometric and polarimetric signals due to the spot . the spot - induced perturbations decrease and",
    "lengthen with increasing the source radius . because , by integrating over the source surface , the sharp signals due to the points located at the caustic line shrink . in figure [ fig2d ] , we represent a microlensing event with three different amounts of @xmath2 and considering @xmath90 . the residual for each source size",
    "is calculated from the spotless source of that particular size .",
    "the polarization angle @xmath9 strongly changes due to the stellar spot . because , this polarization angle is not related to the total stokes parameter , i.e. @xmath38 which is very larger than the polarized stokes parameters . on the other hand ,",
    "the polarization angle @xmath10 alters a bit . because , the broad band circular polarization of spots is , one order of magnitude , smaller than the linear ones .",
    "the spot - induced perturbation in the polarization angle causes the polarization vector alters as follows : @xmath91^{1/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] indeed , we define the polarization vector as @xmath92 .",
    "note that in normal microlensing events without spot effect @xmath93 . in figure ( [ fig3 ] )",
    "we show the curves of the polarization angle @xmath9 ( left panel ) and polarization degree ( right panel ) of a microlensing event .",
    "measuring the polarization angles helps us to indicate the different components of the polarized intensity which gives some information about the projection angles @xmath31 and @xmath33 . on the other hand , measuring the polarization angles in addition to the polarization degree can increase detectability of stellar spots through polarimetric measurements , e.g. in figure [ fig2b ]",
    "although the maximum amount of the residual in the polarization degree @xmath79 due to the spot reaches to @xmath94 per cent , but by considering the variation of the polarization angles , the residual in the polarization vector rises up to @xmath95 per cent .",

    "consequently , i assume that about @xmath123 per cent of giant stars have stellar spots and magnetic field stronger than @xmath124 g. the probability of detecting a spot over a giant source through polarimetric measurements in caustic - crossing of microlensing events can be given by : @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the polarimetric efficiency for detecting spot - induced signals in the simulated events , @xmath127 is the optical depth for the microlensing events towards a given direction . for the direction of the galactic bulge",
    "@xmath128 @xcite , hence the optical depth for the polarimetric spot detection is @xmath129 .",
    "finally , we estimate the number of events for @xmath130 background stars being detected during the observational time @xmath131 as @xmath132 where the average einstein crossing time for the galactic bulge events due to the giant sources is about @xmath133   days @xcite . by monitoring @xmath134 million objects during @xmath135 years towards the galactic bugle ,",
    "the number of binary microlensing events with spotted and giant sources , which have detectable spot - induced polarimetric signals , is @xmath136 .",
    "finally , we investigate in how fraction of these simulated events the photometric spot - induced signal @xmath137 is greater than @xmath138 per cent . in this regard ,",

    "note that , we consider only giant stars as sources and do not consider main - sequence stars . in figure ( [ fignew ] )",
    "the black stars show these events which have detectable photometric signatures due to the spot .",
    "consequently , photometry observation is more efficient in detecting stellar spots than the polarimetry observation .",
    "however , polarimetry observations during microlensing events give us some information about the magnetic field of the spots over the sources whereas the photometric signals due to the spots do not depend on it . on the other hand , the stellar spots change polarization orientation in addition to the polarization degree whereas in the photometric observations of spotted sources only the magnification factor alters .",
    "variation of the polarization angles give us extra information about the different components of the polarized intensity and as a result the position of spot on the source surface .",
    "also , the polarimetry observations can be complementary to the photometry observations for detecting stellar spots with larger amounts of the projection angle @xmath31 .",
    "gravitational microlensing with finite size effect provides a technique to probe the anomalies over the source surface specially in caustic crossing .",

    "the stellar spots also create a net polarization for the source star .",
    "although most spot - induced polarimetric signals of galactic bulge sources are too weak to be detected , but the lensing effect can magnify the spot - induced polarization signal and makes it be observed . however , lensing effect itself generates a net polarization for the source star . here , we investigated the possibility of detecting the source spot through polarimetric observations during caustic - crossing in microlensing events . in this regard , we studied how the stellar spot perturbs polarimetric and photometric curves in binary microlensing events during caustic - crossing .",
    "the stellar spot perturbs the microlensing light curves by making positive and negative deviations @xcite .",
    "if the time when the photometric deviation due to spot is zero ( between positive and negative deviations ) is inferred from microlensing light curves , we can indicate the magnification factor of the spot which helps us to characterize the spot properties except the temperature contrast .",
    "we figured out some points about the spot - induced perturbations on the polarization degree explained in following :    \\(a ) the cooler spots have the higher magnetic fields and larger polarization signals , but they have the smaller contributions in the total flux .",
    "we showed that these two properties of spots , temperature contrast and magnetic field , have the same contributions in the polarimetric signal so that increasing both together does not change the polarization signal .",
    "\\(b ) the maximum deviation in the polarimetry curve due to the spot happens when the spot is located at the source edge and source is entering to the caustic curve from that edge ( near the spot ) .",
    "\\(c ) there is a ( partial ) degeneracy for indicating the spot size , its temperature contrast with respect to the host star and its magnetic induction from the deviations in light or polarimetric curves .",
    "\\(d ) the spot - induced deviations decrease and lengthen by enhancing the finite size effect .",
    "\\(e ) the stellar spots alter the polarization degree as well as strongly change its orientation .",
    "variation of the second gives some information about the spot projection angles .",
    "finally , we estimate the number of the source spots that can be observed with this method towards the galactic bulge . during",
    "@xmath135 years monitoring of @xmath134 million stars towards the galactic bulge , we can specify in the order of @xmath138 stellar spot over giant sources with this method whereas about @xmath141 stellar spots over giants can be confirmed through photometric observations .",
    "hence , photometry observation is more efficient in detecting stellar spots than the polarimetry observation .",
