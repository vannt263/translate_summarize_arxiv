    "the paradigm of cp violation related to the structure of ckm matrix in the standard model ( and its beyond ) is fueling an impressive experimental programme for the study of both exclusive and inclusive b - decays .",

    "the semileptonic decay modes of b mesons are much cleaner samples then the nonleptonic decay modes since in these modes , there does not exist any problems connected with the presence of a third strongly interacting particle . for this reason , the study of semileptonic decays is one of the efficient ways for the determination of the ckm matrix elements .",

    "the detailed description of the method and its applications can be found in @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that interest to the @xmath0 and @xmath6 semileptonic decays is due to the fact that they also give information on the @xmath7 mixing ( see for example @xcite ) .",

    "first let us consider the hadronic representation of the correlator . by inserting a complete set of states with the same quantum numbers as the operator @xmath15 between the currents and isolating the pole term of the lowest pseudo scalar @xmath16 meson , we get the following hadronic representation of the correlator : _ ( p , q ) & = & + _ h + & = & _ 1(q^2 , ( p+q)^2 ) p_+ _ 2 ( q^2 , ( p+q)^2 ) q_[eq3 ]    the sum in eq .",
