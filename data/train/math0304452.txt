    "-5 mm    the long - time behaviour of solutions to the evolutionary equations arising in the mathematical fluid mechanics has been the subject of many theoretical studies .",
    "this type of problems is apparently related to the phenomena of turbulence , and there is still a significant gap between many formal  scenarios \" and mathematically rigorous results .    the dynamical systems in question are usually related to a system of partial differential equations and , consequently , they are defined in an infinite dimensional phase space . on the other hand ,",
    "the presence of dissipative terms in the equations due to viscosity results in the existence of global attractors - compact invariant sets attracting uniformly in time all trajectories emanating from a given bounded set .",
    "such a theory is well developed for the incompressible linearly viscous fluids , and the reader may consult the monographs of babin and vishik @xcite , temam @xcite or constantin et al .",
    "@xcite for the recent state of art .    on the other hand , much less seems to be known for the compressible fluids .",
    "while there is an existence theory of the weak solutions for the incompressible navier - stokes equations due to leray @xcite , its  compressible \" counterpart appeared only recently in the work of lions @xcite . even in the incompressible case",
    ", there is a qualitative difference between the two - dimensional case solved by ladyzhenskaya @xcite , and the three - dimensional case representing one of the most challenging unsolved problems of modern mathematics .",
    "it is worth - noting that a similar gap divides the one and more - dimensional problems for the compressible fluids .",
    "the time evolution of the fluid density @xmath0 and the velocity @xmath1 is governed by the navier - stokes system of equations :    @xmath2    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the pressure , @xmath5 the viscous stress tensor , and @xmath6 a given external force .    in what follows",
    ", we consider linearly viscous ( newtonian ) fluids where the viscous stress is related to the velocity by the constitutive law @xmath7 where the viscosity coefficients satisfy @xmath8    generally speaking , the pressure @xmath4 depends on the density and the internal energy ( temperature ) of the fluid . if it is the case , the system ( [ i1 ] ) , ( [ i2 ] ) is not closed and should be complemented by the energy equation .",
    "unfortunately , however , the available global existence results for this full system allow for only for small initial data ( cf .",
    "matsumura and nishida @xcite ) .",
    "there are physically relevant situations when one can assume the flow is barotropic , i.e. , the pressure depends solely on the density .",
    "this is the case when either the temperature ( the isothermal case ) or the entropy ( the isentropic case ) are supposed to be constant .",
    "the typical constitutive relation between the pressure and the density then reads @xmath9 where @xmath10 in the isothermal case , and @xmath11 represents the adiabatic constant in the isentropic regime .",
    "more general and even non - monotone pressure - density constitutive laws arise in nuclear plasma physics ( see @xcite ) . in the barotropic regime ,",
    "the equations ( [ i1 ] ) , ( [ i2 ] ) form a closed system and complemented by suitable initial and boundary conditions represent a ( at least formally ) well - posed problem .",
    "if the problem is posed on a spatial domain @xmath12 , one usually assumes that the fluid adheres completely to the boundary which is mathematically expressed by the no - slip boundary conditions for the velocity : @xmath13 note that for viscous fluids such a condition is in a very good agreement with physical experiment .    in accordance with the deterministic principle",
    ", the state of the system at any time @xmath14 should be given by the initial conditions @xmath15 the function @xmath16 is non - negative and the momentum @xmath17 satisfies the compatibility condition @xmath18 the reason why we impose the initial conditions for the momentum @xmath19 rather than for the velocity @xmath20 is that the former quantity is weakly continuous with respect to time while the instantaneous values of the velocity are determined only almost anywhere with respect to time .",
    "clearly such a problem does not arise provided the initial density @xmath16 is strictly positive .",
    "however , it is an interesting open problem whether or not this property is preserved at any positive time for any distributional solution of the problem satisfying the natural energy estimates ( cf .",
    "hoff and smoller @xcite ) .",
    "-5 mm    in order to study the long - time behaviour , one should first make sure that the class of objects one deals with is not void .",
    "more precisely , one should be able to prove the existence of global - in - time solution for any initial data @xmath16 , @xmath17 satisfying some physically relevant hypothesis .",
    "multiplying the equations of motion by @xmath20 and integrating by parts one deduces the energy inequality @xmath21 + \\int_{\\omega } \\mu |\\nabla \\vec{u } |^2 + ( \\lambda + \\mu ) |{\\rm div } \\",

    "similarly as in the theory of the variational ( weak ) solutions developed for the incompressible case by leray , it is not clear if it is satisfied for any weak solution of the problem .",
    "following diperna and lions @xcite we shall say that @xmath29 , @xmath20 is a renormalized solution of the continuity equation ( [ i1 ] ) if the identity @xmath30 holds in the sense of distributions for any function @xmath31 such that @xmath32 similarly as for the energy inequality , it is not known if any weak solution @xmath29 , @xmath20 of ( [ i1 ] ) satisfies ( [ f3 ] ) .",

    "the hypotheses concerning @xmath52 were relaxed in @xcite , @xcite , the case of a general bounded domain @xmath36 treated in @xcite , and the hypothesis of monotonicity of the pressure removed in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "-5 mm    the first issue to be discussed when describing the long - time asymptotics of a given dynamical system is ultimate boundedness or dissipativity .",

    "indeed the value @xmath66 happens to be the largest adiabatic constant corresponding to a monoatomic gas .    under the hypotheses of theorem 3.1 ,",
    "the dissipative mechanism induced by viscocity is strong enough to prevent any  resonance \" phenomena , i.e. , the existence of unbounded solutions driven by a bounded external force .",

    "-5 mm    the property of asymptotic compactness of a given dynamical system plays a crucial role in the proof of existence of a global ( compact ) attractor . here , the main problem is the density component which is bounded only in @xmath72 , and , consequently , compact only with respect to the weak topology on this space .",
    "moreover , given the hyperbolic character of the continuity equation , one can not hope any possible oscillations of the density to be killed at a finite time .",
