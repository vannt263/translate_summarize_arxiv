    "the large-@xmath1 reduction @xcite asserts that large-@xmath1 gauge theories on flat space - times are equivalent to matrix models ( reduced models ) that are obtained by dimensional reduction to lower dimensions ( for further developments , see @xcite ) .",
    "it is not only conceptually relevant because it realizes emergent space - time in matrix models , but also practically relevant because it can give a non - perturbative formulation of planar gauge theories as an alternative to lattice gauge theories .",
    "it is well - known that the equivalence does not hold naively due to the @xmath7 symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "some remedy is needed for the equivalence to indeed hold ( for recent studies , see @xcite ) . however , as far as we know , there has been no remedy that manifestly preserves supersymmetry in gauge theories .",
    "recently , the large-@xmath1 reduction was generalized to theories on @xmath0 in @xcite ( for earlier discussions , see @xcite ) . here",
    "@xmath0 is constructed as a nontrivial @xmath8 fiber bundle over @xmath9 by expanding matrix models around a particular background corresponding to a sequence of fuzzy spheres .",
    "this novel large-@xmath1 reduction is important from both of the above two viewpoints .",
    "it would give hints to the problem of describing curved space - time @xcite in the matrix models @xcite .",
    "unlike on flat space - times , the equivalence would hold on curved space - times without any remedy since the theories are massive due to the curvature of @xmath0 .",
    "the novel large-@xmath1 reduction can , therefore , give a non - perturbative regularization of gauge theories that respects both supersymmetry and the gauge symmetry .",
    "the novel large-@xmath1 reduction has been studied mainly for two cases so far .",
    "one is @xmath10 sym on @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the reduced model of this theory takes the form of the plane wave matrix model @xcite .",
    "the large-@xmath1 reduction provides a non - perturbative formulation of @xmath10 sym , which respects sixteen supersymmetries and the gauge symmetry so that no fine tuning of the parameters is required .",
    "thus the formulation gives a feasible way to analyze the strongly coupled regime of @xmath10 sym , for instance , by putting it on a computer through the methods proposed in @xcite , and therefore enables us to perform new nontrivial tests of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "the other is chern - simons ( cs ) theory on @xmath0 , which has been exactly solved @xcite . in this case , the equivalence between the reduced model and the original theory can be verified explicitly , which was briefly reported in @xcite . in this paper , we present the verification of the equivalence in detail .",
    "we also discuss the large-@xmath1 reduction for cs theory on @xmath12 .",
    "our result is an explicit demonstration of the novel large-@xmath1 reduction .",
    "cs theory on @xmath0 is a topological field theory associated with the knot theory and therefore interesting in its own right .",
    "our formulation gives a new regularization method for cs theory on @xmath0 .",
    "cs theory on @xmath0 is also interpreted as open topological a strings on @xmath13 in the presence of @xmath1 d - branes wrapping @xmath0 .",
    "topological strings capture some aspects of more realistic string , so that our study is expected to give some insights into the matrix models as a non - perturbative formulation of superstring .",
    "more recently , it was shown in @xcite that the large-@xmath1 reduction holds on general group manifolds . in the case of @xmath14 ,",
    "the background taken in the large-@xmath1 reduction in @xcite is different from that in @xcite .",
    "it is desirable to explicitly demonstrate this different type of the large-@xmath1 reduction , for instance , in the case of cs theory on @xmath0 .",
    "we leave this for a future study .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly review cs theory on @xmath0 . in section 3",
    ", we summarize the relationships among cs theory on @xmath0 , 2d ym on @xmath9 and the matrix model which were obtained in @xcite . in section 4 ,",
    "we argue how cs theory on @xmath0 is realized in the matrix model as a novel large-@xmath1 reduction . in section 5",
    ", we show the equivalence between the theory around a particular background of the matrix model and cs theory on @xmath0 . in section 6 , by using the monte carlo simulation , we give a check of this equivalence .",
    "section 7 is devoted to conclusion and discussion . in appendices",
    ", some details are gathered .",
    "in this section , we review some known facts about cs theory on @xmath0 needed for this paper @xcite .",
    "we consider cs theory on @xmath0 with the gauge group @xmath15 , whose action is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 must be an integer .",
    "the partition function @xmath18 defines a topological invariant of the manifold @xmath0 , which also depends on a choice of framing .",
    "given an oriented knot @xmath19 in @xmath0 , one can consider the wilson loop in an irreducible representation @xmath20 of @xmath15 @xmath21 the expectation value of the wilson loop @xmath22 defines a topological invariant of @xmath19 depending on a choice of framing as well . in this paper , we are concerned with the wilson loop for the unknot , which we denote by @xmath23 , and mainly consider the wilson loop for the unknot in the fundamental representation , which we denote by @xmath24 .",

    "the expectation value of the wilson loop for the unknot was also computed exactly : @xmath46 one can obtain different expressions for ( [ result for the partition function ] ) and ( [ result for the wilson loop ] ) by using weyl s character formula @xmath47 and weyl s denominator formula @xmath48 where @xmath49 are positive roots , and @xmath50 is the set of weights associated to the representation @xmath20 . by applying ( [ denominator formula ] ) to ( [ result for the partition function ] ) , one obtains @xmath51 while by applying ( [ character formula ] ) and ( [ denominator formula ] ) to ( [ result for the wilson loop ] ) @xmath52 for the fundamental representation , it reduces to @xmath53    furthermore , by using ( [ denominator formula ] ) , one can show that ( [ result for the partition function ] ) is equivalent to an integral over @xmath1 variables which takes the form analogous to a partition function of a matrix model @xcite : @xmath54 where we have introduced @xmath55 which is identified with the string coupling in the context of topological strings .",

    "one can see from ( [ partition function by surgery ] ) that the partition function in this framing is related to the one in the canonical framing as @xmath59 one can also see from ( [ wilson loop by surgery ] ) that the expectation value of the wilson loop is related to the one in the canonical framing as @xmath60 in particular , because @xmath61 for the fundamental representation , one obtains @xmath62 similarly , the perturbative part of the free energy is evaluated in this framing as @xmath63    in the following sections , we will show that the reduced model of cs theory on @xmath0 reproduces the results for the original theory in the framing corresponding @xmath58 .",
    "in this section , we review part of the results in @xcite , which we use in this paper . in section 3.1 ,",
    "we dimensionally reduce cs theory on @xmath0 to 2d ym on @xmath9 and a matrix model . in section 3.2 , we describe a classical equivalence between the theory around each multiple monopole background of 2d ym on @xmath9 and the theory around a certain multiple fuzzy sphere background of the matrix model . in section 3.3 , we exactly perform the integration in the matrix model . in section 3.4 , using the result in section 3.3 , we show that the equivalence in section 3.2 also holds at quantum level .      in order to dimensionally reduce cs theory on @xmath0 , we expand the gauge field in terms of the right - invariant 1-form defined in ( [ right - invariant 1-form ] ) as @xmath64 we choose an @xmath65-isometric metric for @xmath0 ( [ metric of s^3 ] ) fixing the radius of @xmath0 to @xmath66 .",

    "@xmath128 is the volume of @xmath129 and @xmath130 is the volume of the weyl group of @xmath131 .",
    "next let us concentrate on the factor in the integrand in ( [ calz_m in eigenvalues ] ) , @xmath132 for this factor , we use the following formula , @xmath133 where `` @xmath134 '' denotes the principal value .",
    "then we obtain @xmath135 .",
    "\\label{expanded prod factor}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is easily seen that ( [ expanded prod factor ] ) is written in the sum of terms containing @xmath136 where @xmath137 can take the value @xmath138 and we have reordered and relabeled the eigenvalues of @xmath120 as @xmath139 the size of the matrices , @xmath140 , satisfies @xmath141 .",
    "@xmath142 represents the @xmath122-th component of the @xmath143-th block .",

    "we label the reducible representations by `` @xmath144 '' '' specify the number of irreducible representations of @xmath97 , @xmath137 , and the dimensions of the irreducible representations , @xmath145 , which satisfy the relation @xmath141 . ] and denote the @xmath8 part in the @xmath143-th block by @xmath146 , putting @xmath147 .",
    "then , we obtain @xmath148 where @xmath149    after some calculations , we find that ( [ decomposed form 1 ] ) results in @xmath150 thus the partition function of the matrix model is decomposed into sectors characterized by the ( reducible ) representation of the @xmath97 algebra .",
    "note that @xmath134 prevents the integration over the @xmath8 part @xmath146 from mixing the sectors .      in this subsection , we show that the partition function of ym on @xmath9 is obtained from that of the matrix model @xcite .",
    "as we will see , the sector which consists of @xmath137 irreducible representations in the matrix model corresponds to @xmath151 2d ym on @xmath9 . in the @xmath137 block sector , we group the irreducible representations with the same dimension and label the groups by @xmath100 , such that @xmath152 for @xmath153 .",
    "we denote the multiplicity of the @xmath100-th group by @xmath154 . then , the relations @xmath155 and @xmath156 are satisfied .",
    "we also denote the @xmath122-th @xmath8 part in the @xmath100-th group by @xmath157 , where @xmath158 .",
    "note that in this notation @xmath159 in ( [ n_r ] ) equals @xmath160 .",
    "since the partition function of the matrix model ( [ result mm partition function ] ) is completely decomposed into sectors without overlap , we can extract the sectors consisting of @xmath137 blocks . in the @xmath137-block sector ,",
    "due to the factor @xmath161 , configurations of almost equal size blocks are dominant in the limit in which @xmath162 .",
    "so , we consider configurations around the dominated configuration by setting @xmath163 where @xmath164 . substituting this into the @xmath137-block sector in ( [ result mm partition function ] ) and taking the limit ( [ limit ] ) , we obtain @xmath165 here we have absorbed overall irrelevant constants and divergences into a renormalized constant @xmath166 . we have also replaced the denominator in the integrand in ( [ result mm partition function ] ) by constant ( @xmath167 ) and taken the integral regions of @xmath157 to @xmath168 , since the exponential factor in ( [ result mm partition function ] ) oscillates rapidly around @xmath169 in the limit where @xmath170 and @xmath171 , so that the integral dominates around @xmath172 .    finally , by rescaling @xmath157 by @xmath173 , and making an analytical continuation @xmath174",

    "however , this difference does not matter in the following arguments . ] in ym on @xmath9 , @xmath104 are identified with the monopole charges since the @xmath104 dependent term in the exponential coincides with the contribution of the classical solution ( [ monopole solution ] ) to the action of 2d ym .",
    "this fact is consistent with the classical equivalence reviewed in section 3.2 .",
    "in this section , we provide a prescription for realization of cs theory on @xmath0 in 2d ym on @xmath9 and in the matrix model .",
    "we also generalize the prescription to cs theory on @xmath12 . in section 5",
    ", we prove the large-@xmath1 equivalence between cs theory and the matrix model based on this prescription .",
    "cs theory on @xmath0 is realized from 2d ym on @xmath9 through the large-@xmath1 reduction for the case of compact space proposed in @xcite as follows .",
    "note that the kaluza - klein ( kk ) momenta along the fiber ( @xmath178 ) direction in @xmath0 are regarded as the monopole charges on @xmath9 .",
    "hence , if one considers the particular monopole solution in 2d ym on @xmath9 such that the spectrum of the monopole charges reproduces the spectrum of the kk momenta along @xmath178 , the theory on @xmath9 expanded around such monopole solution is equivalent to cs theory on @xmath0 .",
    "more precisely , in order to realize cs theory on @xmath0 , we first put @xmath179 and @xmath180 in ( [ monopole solution 1 ] ) ( or in ( [ monopole solution ] ) ) and then make @xmath100 run from @xmath181 to @xmath182 , where @xmath35 is a positive even integer",
    ". finally we take the following limit , @xmath183 then , we see that 2d ym on @xmath9 expanded around the monopole background is equivalent to @xmath15 cs theory on @xmath0 in the planar limit . here , we can identify the difference of the monopole charges @xmath184 with the momenta @xmath185 along the @xmath178 fiber direction and @xmath35 is interpreted as the momentum cutoff . introducing @xmath1 and taking the limit",
    "@xmath186 are needed to suppress the non - planar contribution @xcite . as for the relation between the coupling constants of the two theories ,",
    "we naively expect that @xmath187 .",
    "however , the last relation in ( [ limit 1 ] ) implies that we need some renormalization . in sections 5 and 6",
    ", we show that the above prescription including the renormalization of the coupling constant is indeed valid .",
    "furthermore , by combining this equivalence with the relationship between 2d ym on @xmath9 and the matrix model reviewed in section 3.4 , we obtain the following statement : if one takes in ( [ matrix background ] ) @xmath188 and takes the limit in which @xmath189 the theory around ( [ matrix background ] ) of the matrix model ( [ n=1^ * matrix model ] ) is equivalent to @xmath15 cs theory on @xmath0 in the planar limit . in sections 5 and 6",
    ", we confirm this statement . the particular background",
    "( [ background ] ) and the limit ( [ s^3 limit ] ) is the same as the ones adopted in realizing @xmath10 sym on @xmath11 in pwmm @xcite . @xmath103 and @xmath35 play the role of the ultraviolet cutoffs for the angular momenta on @xmath9 and in the fiber direction , respectively .    the results in section 3.4 and",
    "the above prescriptions lead us to consider the following statistical model , @xmath190 this model is obtained from ( [ 2dym mp ] ) by making an analytic continuation as @xmath191 , @xmath192 and putting @xmath179 , @xmath180 ( @xmath193 ) .",
    "it follows from the above arguments that this model reproduces the planar limit of cs theory on @xmath0 in the limit in which @xmath194 with @xmath195 in the next section , we will verify the equivalence of cs theory on @xmath0 with ( [ z of mm ] ) which is equivalent to the reduced matrix model expanded around the particular background .",
    "we can easily extend the above argument to cs theory on @xmath12 .",
    "we consider the case in which @xmath196 acts on the circle along the fiber direction in @xmath0 .",
    "if we use the notation in appendix a , the periodicity for @xmath12 is expressed as , @xmath197 so that the radius of the fiber direction is @xmath198 of that for @xmath199 and the momenta along the fiber direction are discretized as @xmath200 .",
    "then , we see that if one imposes ( [ background ] ) with the second equation replaced with @xmath201 and takes the limit ( [ s^3 limit ] ) , the theory around ( [ matrix background ] ) of the matrix model ( [ n=1^ * matrix model ] ) is equivalent to @xmath15 cs theory on @xmath12 in the planar limit . correspondingly , the statistical model for cs theory on @xmath12 is given by replacing @xmath202 in ( [ z of mm ] ) with @xmath203 .",
    "in this section , we prove our statement that the model ( [ z of mm ] ) reproduces the planar limit of cs theory on @xmath0 in the limit shown in ( [ limit 2 ] ) and ( [ limit 3 ] ) .",
    "this equivalence can be understood from a correspondence between the feynman diagrams in the two theories .",

    "we show that they coincide with the results in cs theory on @xmath0 completely in the planar limit .",
    "let us first consider the feynman rule of ( [ z of mm ] ) .",
    "for this purpose , we rewrite ( [ z of mm ] ) into a manifestly @xmath15 invariant form .",
    "we will see that the result is given by a multi - matrix model with double trace interaction .",
    "this form allows us to compare the two theories explicitly .",
    "we first factorize the measure in ( [ z of mm ] ) as follows , @xmath204 the first factor on the right hand side is just a constant which we will omit in the following and the second factor gives the vandermonde determinant for each @xmath100 .",

    "more precisely , the connected diagrams in this theory are those which are connected by dashed lines or by double lines .",
    "one can show that only such diagrams indeed contribute to the calculation of observables .",
    "since we are interested in the planar limit , we consider what type of diagrams is dominant in this limit .",
    "it is easy to see that the leading order in the @xmath223 expansion is given by the diagrams that satisfy two conditions .",
    "one is that they are planar diagrams with respect to the double lines in the ordinary sense .",
    "the other is that they are divided by two parts by cutting any dashed line .",
    "we call the diagrams satisfying the latter condition ` tree ' diagrams in this paper",
    ". we can see that the diagrams in which the dashed lines form any loop ( i.e. non-`tree ' diagrams ) give subleading contribution .",
    "in fig.[typical diagram in mm ] , the left diagram contributes to the free energy in the large-@xmath1 limit while the right diagram is suppressed since the dashed lines form a loop .",
    "next , we construct a feynman rule of cs matrix model ( [ csm ] ) .",
