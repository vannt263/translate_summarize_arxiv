    "the use of electric fields to drive flow parallel to charged surfaces at the micro- and nano - scale is ubiquitous in science and technology , with applications in numerous fields , from `` lab - on - a - chip '' devices @xcite and nanofluidics @xcite to membrane and soil science , and the separation and analysis of biological macromolecules @xcite . in its simplest form ,",
    "the fluid velocity @xmath0 far from the charged surface is proportional to the applied electric field @xmath1 , @xmath2 . the electro - osmotic mobility @xmath3 is given by the helmholtz - smoluchowski equation @xcite , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the solvent permitivity",
    ", @xmath6 is the solvent viscosity , and the so - called zeta potential @xmath7 is the electric potential at the shear plane . in neat ( single - component ) solvents ,",
    "this electro - osmotic flow ( eof ) has been studied extensively @xcite , with more recent works focusing on the influence of the channel geometry @xcite , surface slip @xcite , ion - specificity @xcite and the solvent rheology @xcite .",
    "eof in solvent mixtures is common in non - aqueous capillary electrophoresis @xcite , and was investigated also for aqueous mixtures @xcite , but the electrokinetics in such systems is not well understood .",
    "the differences between the electrostatics of neat solvents compared to solvent mixtures has also been an area of intense research in recent years , with the growing use of miscible and non - miscible oil - water mixtures in colloidal science and microfluidics . a crucial role is played by the partitioning of ions between solvents , due to their preferential solvation in one of the liquids @xcite .",
    "the preferential wetting of one liquid at a solid surface or the presence of a liquid - liquid interface therefore also affects the electrostatics of the mixture .",
    "it leads to a modification of colloid - colloid @xcite as well as colloid - interface interactions @xcite .",
    "the strength of preferential solvation is measured by the gibbs transfer energy @xmath8 of an ion species @xmath9 between two solvents , where @xmath10 is the thermal energy , and @xmath11 for aqueous mixtures of relatively polar organic solvents @xcite , but can be as large as @xmath12 in less polar solvents containing antagonistic salts @xcite . for monovalent salts dissolved in mixtures , the combined effect of both ionic species @xcite is conveniently expressed in terms of the average overall solubility @xmath13 , and the solubility contrast , @xmath14 , which for example , determines the donnan potential @xmath15 at oil - water interfaces due to ion partitioning , where @xmath16 is the elementary charge . in this work ,",
    "we show that preferential solvation also affects electrokinetic phenomena in mixtures , where it generates an additional , and significant , source of fluid mobility .",
    "we find that the dominant contribution to this additional mobility is proportional to @xmath17 and is independent of the surface charge , and therefore able to generate flow even at electrically neutral surfaces .",
    "within a continuum theory , we study the flow in a channel containing an electrolytic mixture using direct numerical simulations and a simple linear theory .",
    "we consider an oil - water mixture characterized by the order parameter @xmath18 , which is the deviation of the volume fraction of water in the mixture , @xmath19 , from its critical value @xmath20 : @xmath21 .",

    "this free energy leads to an upper critical solution temperature type phase diagram , with a critical temperature @xmath36 and the corresponding critical flory parameter @xmath37 . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the region @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) , such that the bulk mixture is always homogeneous . the second `` square gradient '' term accounts for composition inhomogeneities at interfaces , where @xmath40 .",
    "the third term is the electrostatic energy density , where @xmath41 is the electric potential , and @xmath42 is the permitivity , assumed to depend linearly on @xmath18 . the final term in the integrand is the ionic free energy , composed of the ideal - gas entropy of ions of species @xmath43 , and the ionic solvation energy , which is proportional to the gibbs free energy of transfer @xmath44 and local solvent composition . note that @xmath44 can greatly vary between ionic species depending on their size , charge and chemistry .",

    "the channel is very long such that edge effects are negligible and translational invariance in the @xmath24 direction applies , ( iii ) the dominant body force in [ eq : ns ] is the electric body force , and ( iv ) convective composition and ion currents in the channel are negligible since the corresponding pclet numbers are small .",

    "the channel surface is uncharged ( @xmath91 ) , but is hydrophilic ( @xmath127 ) , resulting in the adsorption of water near the wall .",
    "since the anions are hydrophilic the water `` drags '' them along , and hence the anions also effectively adsorb at the surface , see the ionic profiles in [ fig_prof1]b .",
    "although the cations are indifferent to the local composition , they also adsorb at the surface due to electrostatics , but are distributed more broadly .",

    "the thickness of the charged layer at the surface @xmath128 could be estimated in experiments from the characteristic lengths @xmath129 .",
    "these length scales are to be estimated from [ eq : solcond1 ] given data for @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "although the fluid is overall neutral , the negative ions layer is more strongly adsorbed at the wall .",
    "when an external axial electric field is applied , this layer then serves as an effective surface charge , and the adjacent positively charged layer as an effective electric double layer .",
    "the result is an induced fluid flow , similar to eof .",

    "indeed , a flow is generated by the overall neutral but locally charged layer of fluid near the wall .",
    "shows that @xmath133 quickly saturates to a plug - like flow of a few mm / s .",
    "we term this solvation - induced phenomenon _ solvo - osmotic flow _ ( sof ) .",
    "this flow is similar and comparable in magnitude to simple eof , shown in [ fig_prof2 ] by the curve for a neat solvent with the same properties as the mixture , but near a weakly charged surface with @xmath135 nm@xmath136 .",
    "sof can either combine or work against eof , as shown by two curves in [ fig_prof2 ] , where we used the parameter of [ fig_prof1 ] , but with non - zero surface charges , @xmath137 nm@xmath136 .",
    "for @xmath138 the result is an enhanced flow with the velocity at the channel center slightly smaller than the sum of sof and eof on their own . in a neat solvent , when @xmath139 changes sign",
    "one expects a simple change of sign also for the velocity .",
    "however , here sof opposes eof for @xmath140 and , for the parameters of [ fig_prof2 ] , the result is that inside most of the channel @xmath141 remains positive , but with a much smaller magnitude .",
    "there is , however , a weak back flow close to the channel wall resulting from the radial component of the body force in the fluid becoming significant in this case .     at an applied field of @xmath142 v / mm for several scenarios ,",
    "see the labels in the figure .",
    "all other parameters are the same as in [ fig_prof1 ] .",

    "only the first term @xmath151 in [ eq : lin_mu ] exists for a neat solvent @xcite . in a mixture",
    ", @xmath7 is determined also by the properties of the salt and surface through the second term @xmath152 in [ eq : lin_mu ] , which plays the role of an effective surface charge .",
    "the attractive feature of [ eq : lin_mu ] is the ability to easily tune the fluid mobility through @xmath17 without making any surface modification .",
    "for example , by replacing the anion cl@xmath153 with the hydrophobic anion bph@xmath154 , we have @xmath155 @xcite ( instead of @xmath156 ) , which would then change @xmath3 drastically , in some cases even its sign . as we show below",
    ", the dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath131 in mixtures opens the possibility to tune the mobility also with temperature , since @xmath131 diverges near the mixture critical temperature .",
    "nevertheless , we stress that @xmath157 for completely miscible mixtures ( the @xmath158 limit in our theory ) .",
    "hence , [ eq : lin_mu ] should be applicable to mixtures in general , and as the crosses in [ fig_prof2 ] confirm , it is in good agreement with the numerical results for @xmath159 .     on ( a ) the surface - solvent coupling @xmath59 , ( b ) the surface charge @xmath60 , ( c ) the salt concentration @xmath27 and ( d ) the temperature @xmath160 , for three types of electrolytic mixtures ( see text ) .",
    "symbols correspond to numerical results and lines to [ eq : lin_mu ] . in ( b)-(d ) , we plot also @xmath3 for a neat solvent with the same physical properties as the mixtures ( circles ) . in panels ( a)-(c ) , @xmath161 k is fixed while in panels ( a ) , ( b ) and ( d ) we keep @xmath120 mm fixed . for the mixture data sets in ( b)-(d ) we took @xmath92 and in ( a ) , ( c ) and ( d ) we took @xmath91 .",
    "for the neat solvent in ( c)-(d ) , we used @xmath162 nm@xmath136 .",
    "inset of ( b ) : the shift in mobility between the mixtures and the neat solvent.,width=504 ]    in [ fig_prm1 ] we show the effects of varying some of the free parameters of our model on the fluid mobility , and compare numerical results ( symbols ) with [ eq : lin_mu ] ( lines ) .",
    "we compare three types of electrolytic mixtures , one containing nacl ( diamonds ) as before and two containing so - called antagonistic salts in which one of the ions is hydrophilic and the other hydrophobic . in order to single out the role of @xmath17 , we choose @xmath163 by setting @xmath164=2 ( squares ) and 4 ( triangles ) .",
    "[ fig_prm1]a shows the pure sof mobility as a function of the surface field @xmath59 , revealing that the linear theory becomes an excellent approximation for small enough @xmath165 , for which @xmath166 holds , and that @xmath3 increases with @xmath59 and @xmath17 , as expected from [ eq : lin_mu ] . notice that the sign of @xmath3 depends on the wetting properties of the surface . for the salts having the same solubility contrast @xmath17 but different overall solubility @xmath167 ( squares and diamonds )",
    ", we find significant differences in the mobility only for large enough @xmath165 . in this regime ,",
    "the ions entropy decrease near the wall hinders their adsorption , leading to a reduced mobility compared to the linear theory .    in [ fig_prm1]b - d",
    "we also contrast the electrolytic mixtures with a neat solvent ( circles ) having the same physical properties as the mixtures . in [ fig_prm1]b",
    "we examine the effect of adding a fixed surface charge @xmath139 .",
    "clearly , here sof increases the mobility compared to regular eof in a neat solvent .",
    "the inset of [ fig_prm1]b shows that the shift in mobility is almost constant and increases with @xmath17 for the antagonistic salts , as expected from [ eq : lin_mu ] .",
    "the mobility shift is not constant for nacl , rather it increases with @xmath139 , and the result is an an asymmetry in the mobility when @xmath139 changes sign , an effect that is absent in neat solvents .",
    "this effect originates from the nonlinear coupling between electrostatics and solvation @xcite , and is expressed by the next order term @xmath168 in the expansion of @xmath169 .",
    "this contribution vanishes for our ideal antagonistic salts , but should be relevant for the majority of realistic salts .",
    "the relative shift in mobility due to sof is significant for the weakly to moderately charged surfaces we considered here , which is a common situation for hydrophobic surfaces @xcite , or in hydrophilic surfaces near their iso - electric point .",
    "for the typically highly charged hydrophilic surfaces the contribution of sof may be small , although this may not always be the case since both @xmath17 and @xmath59 can be much larger than the values used in this work .    in [ fig_prm1]c - d",
    "we show the influence of the salt concentration and temperature , respectively , on mobility . in both panels",
    "we compare electrolytic mixtures in an uncharged channel with a neat solvent in a channel with @xmath162 nm@xmath136 .",
    "strikingly , [ fig_prm1]c shows that the mobility increases with @xmath27 for the mixtures , while it decreases for the neat solvent .",
    "this behaviour follows from the dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath170 in [ eq : lin_mu ] . for constant @xmath139 ,",
    "the contribution to the surface potential from the first term in [ eq : lin_mu ] becomes smaller when @xmath130 decreases , while the second term becomes larger .",
    "c suggests that for @xmath171 mm , the contribution to the mobility from solvation could be dominant when the surface is weakly charged .",
    "sof is enhanced by increasing the ionic strength since this leads also to increased ion adsorption at the wall , which results in a larger effective surface charge .",
    "the opposite dependence on @xmath27 between the two terms in [ eq : lin_mu ] can therefore lead to a minimum in the mobility of mixtures at charged surfaces , which is confirmed by numerical calculations ( not shown ) .",
    "d demonstrates that , in mixtures , temperature can be used to effectively tune the mobility , whereas its effect is much smaller in neat solvents .",
    "the reason is that the correlation length @xmath131 diverges as the @xmath36 is approached from the one - phase region at the critical composition . in [ eq : lin_mu ] , the mobility increases with @xmath131 , or equivalently , when the temperature is lowered towards @xmath36 , which is confirmed by the numerical results in [ fig_prm1]d . here , the agreement with the linear theory is not as good since @xmath18 is no longer small when @xmath36 is approached .",
    "the numerical results show that @xmath3 changes by as much at @xmath172 in a temperature window of @xmath173 k , whereas it essentially remains constant for the neat solvent .",
    "we did not account , however , for the change of @xmath5 with temperature .",
    "this effect will be at play for both mixtures and neat solvents , and should be smaller since , for example , the permitivity of water changes only by about @xmath174 in the same temperature window .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that the electro - osmotic mobility of mixtures contains an additional contribution due to the preferential solvation of ions .",
    "this contribution allows to drive flow at an electrically neutral surface and to vary the mobility significantly by changing the type of salt or the temperature .",
    "all of our results can be directly extended to the phoretic motion of particles in an applied field .",
    "a comparison of our results with existing experiments @xcite is difficult to preform at this point , because capillary electrophoresis experiments employ fused silica surfaces , which are typically highly - charged and , more importantly , charge - regulating . a modification of the theory is thus required to better mimic experimental conditions .",
    "this should include the chemical dissociation equilibrium at the channel surface , and the change in the fluid viscosity with composition .",
    "for the study of transient sof , one should also consider the asymmetry in the cation and anion diffusion constants , and their dependence on the solvent composition .",
    "our work points towards promising possibilities for the utilization of sof in the transport of fluids through channels and of colloids by external fields , and we hope it will lead to systematic experiments on the electrokinetics of solvent mixtures .    we acknowledge discussions with h. burak eral . we thank the anonymous referees for their useful comments and suggestions .",
