    "use of multiple transmit and receive antennas essentially increases the spectral efficiency of wireless systems ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "analysis of rayleigh flat - fading multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) scenarios with @xmath0 transmit antennas and @xmath1 transmitted symbols , reveals that relevant coding schemes can be designed as collections of elements ( points ) in the complex grassmann manifold - the set of @xmath0-dimensional linear subspaces in @xmath2 , if the channel is unknown to the receiver , and in the complex stiefel manifold - the set of @xmath0 orthonormal vectors in @xmath2 , if the channel is known to the receiver .",
    "an appropriately defined distance measure between the points characterizes diversity of the designed scheme . following standard for coding theory considerations , we study the relation between the number of points ( the size of a code ) and the minimum distance between distinct code points .",
    "our aim in this paper is to obtain new upper bounds for the size of codes in grassmann and stiefel manifolds .",
    "the most powerful technique for this kind of problems is the linear programming method ( called also the polynomial method ) , initiated by delsarte @xcite .",
    "the method is very well understood in the case of @xmath3-point homogeneous spaces ( defined in the next section ) , where very explicit bounds , and also good asymptotic bounds on the rate of codes have been derived .",
    "examples are the hamming and johnson schemes , treated in @xcite , the unit sphere of @xmath4 @xcite , and the projective spaces @xcite , @xcite .    when the underlying space is homogeneous and symmetric but not @xmath3-point homogeneous , the situation is much more complicated , although the principles of the linear programming method remain valid .",
    "the difficulties come from the fact that the zonal functions defined for these spaces are not functions of one variable , but afford several variables .",
    "the grassmann spaces considered in this paper fall into this category .",
    "an attempt to overcome this problem was carried out in @xcite .",
    "an asymptotic bound for the rate of grassmannian codes was obtained , involving the asymptotics of the largest eigenvalue of some symmetric endomorphism .",
    "this bound however is not optimal since it was improved for @xmath5 by some volume - type arguments for a large range of values of the minimal distance @xcite .",
    "there is one trivial case of symmetric spaces of rank @xmath5 for which the classical treatment of the linear programming method is easily extended : it is the direct product of @xmath3-point homogeneous spaces , such as the direct product of @xmath0 copies of the unit sphere .",
    "an example of a similarly easy case is provided by the non - binary johnson space @xcite , that is the product of the hamming and the binary johnson scheme .",
    "the approach developed this paper is to relate grassmann and stiefel spaces and their associated codes to various products of 2-point homogeneous spaces , and hence to derive upper bounds for these codes in a rather easy way .",
    "the asymptotic versions of the new bounds provide the best currently known asymptotic bounds .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "definitions and known results are given in section [ sec def ] .",
    "section [ sec relations ] describes various relations between the spaces and their codes .",
    "the simplest one connects grassmann and stiefel spaces to the unit sphere of an asymptotically equal dimension ; therefrom , for example , we obtain a bound for the asymptotic rate of grassmannian codes that already improves upon the previous ones ( theorem [ bound grass ] ) .",
    "section [ sec products ] develops the delsarte polynomial method for the products of spaces under consideration , including the classical method that involves the christoffel - darboux formula , and derives upper bounds for the size of the associated codes .",
    "a bound for the asymptotic rate of these codes is obtained .",
    "section [ sec grass stief ] discusses the consequences for the grassmannian and stiefel codes .",
    "in particular , we show that the bound obtained on the asymptotic rate of grassmannian codes from the product of projective spaces is sometimes better than the one obtained in section [ sec relations ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec con ] .",
    "we shall use the following notations and definitions .",
    "we say that @xmath6 if @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "a code in a metric space @xmath8 is a finite set contained in the space , and a codeword is an element of the code .",
    "the size of a code @xmath9 is its cardinality , and its rate is @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the natural logarithm .",
    "the meaning of @xmath1 will be defined separately for each space .",
    "indeed , a more consistent and general definition of the rate of a code in a manifold @xmath12 would be @xmath13 .",
    "the minimum distance of a code is the minimum distance ( induced by the relevant metric ) between a pair of distinct codewords . a metric space @xmath8 is called 2-point homogeneous , if @xmath12 affords the transitive action of a group @xmath14 , such that the orbits of the action of @xmath14 on @xmath15 are characterized by the distance @xmath16 .",
    "in other words , for all @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and moreover , for all pairs @xmath20 , @xmath21 , there exists @xmath18 such that @xmath22 and @xmath23 if and only if @xmath24 .",
    "it is a well - known fact that the compact riemannian manifolds that are two - point homogeneous are exactly : the unit sphere @xmath25 , the projective spaces @xmath26 where @xmath27 and the projective plane over the octonions @xmath28 ( see @xcite , and @xcite for more about the octonions and @xmath28 ) .      the unit + sphere of the euclidean space @xmath4 is denoted @xmath25 , namely , @xmath29 the standard scalar product in @xmath4 , given by @xmath30 , defines the euclidean distance between two points of @xmath25 : @xmath31 the angular distance between @xmath32 and @xmath33 is defined by the angle @xmath34 $ ] , also denoted @xmath35 when the context is clear .",
