    "since the early fifties it is known from optical polarisation studies , that magnetic fields are constituents of the galactic interstellar medium .",
    "the magnetic field strength is about a few @xmath2 g .",
    "radio continuum observations clearly indicate synchrotron radiation originating high above the galactic plane .",
    "thus , magnetic fields and cosmic rays are obviously constituents of the galactic halo .",
    "but what is about the gas within the galactic halo ? already parker ( 1966 ) showed , that magnetic fields are always associated with the gaseous phase .",
    "investigations in the uv - range show that highly ionised gas is common within the halo , but it is a long way from a pencil beam to the whole volume of the galactic halo .",
    "recent investigations of the soft x - ray background data indicated the existence of a pervasive x - ray emitting plasma ( @xmath3k ) with a vertical scale height of about 4.4kpc ( pietz et al .",
    "1998 ) within the halo .",
    "moreover , a sensitive analysis of the leiden / dwingeloo survey gave evidence for a emission component with a high velocity dispersion of 60 @xmath4 ( kalberla et al .",
    "1998 ) also detectable across the entire sky .",
    "the discovery of both gas components within the galactic halo encouraged us to study the hydrostatic equilibrium model of the milky way once again . for this approach we studied recent all - sky surveys of gas , soft x - ray radiation , high energy @xmath0-ray emission , and radio - continuum emission .",
    "to describe the large - scale properties of the milky way we used the approach of a hydrostatic halo model , as proposed by parker ( 1966 ) . to describe the gaseous disk - halo system , we identified 3 main constituents of the galactic interstellar medium , namely : the neutral interstellar gas with @xmath5 = 400 pc ( dickey & lockman , 1990 ) , the diffuse ionised gas ( dig ) with @xmath5 = 950 pc ( reynolds , 1997 ) , and halo gas with @xmath5 = 4.4 kpc ( kalberla et al .",
    "1998 , and pietz et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the major difference to the previous studies of the hydrostatic equilibrium of the milky way ( e.g. bloemen 1987 , boulares & cox 1990 ) is the detailed knowledge about the gas phase in the galactic halo .",
    "in particular , the x - ray plasma in combination with the high - velocity dispersion component adds major physical parameters to our model .",
    "1 displays the vertical density distributions of the gas phases ( diffuse neutral and ionised gas as well as the x - ray plasma ) in the solar vicinity .",
    "2 gives an impression on the radial density distribution represented by the parameter @xmath6 according to taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) with @xmath7 kpc .",
    "following parker s ( 1966 ) suggestion , we studied whether gas , magnetic fields and cosmic rays in the galactic halo may be in pressure equilibrium . indeed",
    ", hydrostatic equilibrium models fit the all - sky - averaged observations best . in detail",
    "we tested the hydrostatic equilibrium model by modelling the galactic synchrotron emission at 408 mhz as observed by haslam et al .",
    "( 1982 ) , the @xmath0-ray emission as observed with _ egret _ at energies @xmath8 100 mev ( fichtel et al . 1994 ) as well as by modelling the galactic x - ray plasma distribution deduced from the all - sky survey data ( pietz et al .",
    "a detailed discussion of the model calculations and a quantitative comparison with the observations are beyond the scope of this contribution ; for details we refer to kalberla & kerp ( 1998 ) . here",
    "we summarise the main features of the model .",
    "we found a pressure equilibrium between gas , magnetic fields and cosmic rays within the galactic halo .",
    "the magnetic field of the galactic halo is globally regularly ordered and orientated parallel to the galactic plane .",
    "in contrast to the halo the magnetic field within the disk is highly irregular and has only 1/3 of the gas pressure .",
    "for a galaxy in hydrostatic equilibrium the 3-d distributions of gas pressure , density and gravitational potential are identical in size and shape .",
    "accordingly , we can utilise our parameterisation of the milky way to deduce the gravitational potential _ and _ the dark matter content .    in a simple view , the galaxy consists of 3 main parts : the galactic bulge , the stellar disk with a radial scale length of 4.5 kpc and the gaseous halo as described above . assuming that the gaseous halo traces the dark matter distribution we optimised the density of the gaseous halo component until the rotation velocity of the modelled distribution was in quantitative agreement with the observed rotation velocities ( i. e. fich el al . ,",
    "1990 ) within galactocentric radii 3 @xmath9 25 kpc .",
    "3 shows the corresponding rotation curve .",
    "the total mass of the galaxy within @xmath10 = 50 kpc derived from our model is m=@xmath11 , consistent with m=@xmath12 ( little & tremaine , 1987 ) and also within the uncertainties with the results of kochanek ( 1996 ) of m=@xmath13 .    in fig .",
    "4 we show the gravitational acceleration @xmath14 in the solar neighbourhood as a function of @xmath15 deduced from our model in comparison to that of kuijken & gilmore ( 1989 ) and bienam et al .",
    "( 1987 ) . within vertical distances of @xmath16 kpc our model ( solid line )",
    "is in excellent agreement with @xmath14 derived by kuijken & gilmore ( 1989 ) ( dotted line ) and bienam et al .",
    "( 1987 ) ( dashed line ) .",
    "the differences at larger @xmath17 distance is because of different model assumptions on the dark matter distribution .",
    "the turn - over of our model about 5 kpc above the disk is because of the radial dependence of @xmath14 , as shown in fig.5 ( the solar radius is marked by the dotted line ) .",
    "the large scale properties of the galactic halo are very well modelled assuming that the main constituents of the interstellar matter , the gas , the magnetic fields , and the cosmic rays are in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "we analysed recent all - sky surveys of gas , soft x - ray radiation , high energy @xmath0-rays and synchrotron radiation to test the model assumptions . in general",
    "we find good quantitative agreement between model and data .",
    "the assumption that the gaseous halo traces the dark matter in the galaxy leads to a total mass which is consistent with the observed rotation curve .",
