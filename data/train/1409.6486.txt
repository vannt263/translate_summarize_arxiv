    ", lyubeznik numbers also provide some geometrical and topological information as it was already pointed out in @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the case of isolated singularities , lyubeznik numbers can be described in terms of certain singular cohomology groups in characteristic zero ( see @xcite ) or tale cohomology groups in positive characteristic ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the highest lyubeznik number @xmath21 can be described using the so - called hochster - huneke graph as it has been proved in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however very little is known about the possible configurations of lyubeznik tables except for low dimension cases @xcite , @xcite or the just mentioned case of isolated singularities .    in section 2",
    "we will give some new constraints to the possible configurations of lyubeznik tables .",
    "namely , the main result , theorem  [ consecutiveness ] , establishes some consecutiveness of the non - vanishing superdiagonals of the lyubeznik tables using spectral sequence arguments .    in section 3",
    "we introduce a new set of invariants associated to the linear strands of a minimal free resolution of a @xmath0-graded ideal @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "it turns out that these new invariants satisfy some analogous properties to those of lyubeznik numbers including the aforementioned consecutiveness property .",
    "moreover , we provide a thom - sebastiani type formula for these invariants that is a refinement of the formula for betti numbers given by jacques and katzman in @xcite .",
    "this section should be of independent interest and we hope it could be further developed in future work .",
    "in the rest of the paper we treat the case where @xmath22 is a monomial ideal in a polynomial ring @xmath23 $ ] , and @xmath24 is the graded maximal ideal .",

    "our study on the lyubeznik tables of monomial ideals is a ( very ) special case of that for local rings .",
    "however , advanced techniques in combinatorial commutative algebra are very effective in this setting , and we can go much further than general case , so we hope that monomial ideals are good `` test cases '' for the study of lyubeznik tables .",
    "since local cohomology modules satisfy @xmath27 we often will assume that a monomial ideal @xmath22 is _ squarefree _ , i.e. , @xmath28 .",

    "@xmath29 of a simplicial complex @xmath30 , more precisely , @xmath31 the stanley - reisner ring @xmath32 is one of the most fundamental tools in combinatorial commutative algebra , and it is known that @xmath32 reflects topological properties of the geometric realization @xmath33 of @xmath34 in several ways .    in section 4",
    "we get a deeper insight to the relation , given by the first author and a.  vahidi in @xcite , between lyubeznik numbers of monomial ideals and the linear strands of their associated alexander dual ideals . in particular , we give a different approach to the fact proved in @xcite that if @xmath32 is sequentially cohen - macaulay , then its lyubeznik table is trivial .",
    "we also provide a thom - sebastiani type formula for lyubeznik numbers .",
    "one of the main results of this paper is left for section 5 .",
    "namely , theorem  [ topological ] states that lyubeznik numbers of stanley - reisner rings are not only an algebraic invariant but also a topological invariant , meaning that the lyubeznik numbers of @xmath32 depend on the homeomorphic class of the geometric realization @xmath33 of @xmath34 and the characteristic of the base field .",
    "the proof of this result is quite technical and irrelevant to the other parts of the paper , so we decided to put it in the final section .",
    "we also remark that this result holds in a wider setting .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath12 is a normal simplicial semigroup ring which is gorenstein , and @xmath22 is a monomial ideal , then the corresponding result holds .",
    "we will work in this general setting , since the proof is the same as in the polynomial ring case .",
    "to give a full description of the possible configurations of lyubeznik tables of any local ring seems to be a very difficult task and only a few results can be found in the literature .",
