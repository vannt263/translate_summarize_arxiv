    "graphene , a single layer of graphite , is the thinnest two - dimensional ( 2d ) carbon material consisting of a monolayer carbon atoms in a honeycomb lattice .",
    "this novel material was experimentally discovered in 2004 @xcite and has given rise to enormous scientific and technological impacts in relevant areas of physics , chemistry and materials sciences .",
    "it is considered as a revolutionary material for future generation of high - speed electronics , sensors , transparent electrodes due to its unusual electronic , optical and magnetic properties . for the purpose of modifying graphene for applications in future nano - electronics , many modified graphene - based materials , such as the graphene nanoribbons ( gnrs ) @xcite and hydrogenated - graphene ( graphane ) @xcite ,",
    "have been proposed and widely investigated .",
    "+ graphane , a 2d hydrocarbon material , was suggested first by sluiter and kawazoe @xcite and synthesized @xcite in 2009 through exposure of a single - layer graphene to a hydrogen plasma . since then",
    ", many new configurations with low energies for this 2d hydrocarbon were proposed .",
    "the most stable configuration of graphane is named as `` chair '' @xcite with the ududud hydrogenation in each hexagonal carbon ring as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) ( here we adopt the nomenclature in reference [ 11 ] ) . the second stable configuration named as `` stirrup '' @xcite with the uuuddd hydrogenation in each carbon ring is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) , whose energy is about 28 mev / atom larger than that of the chair one . from the point of view of stability ,",
    "the following configurations for graphane allotropes are boat-1 @xcite with the uudduu hydrogenation , boat-2 @xcite with the uuuudd hydrogenation , twist - boat @xcite with the uududd hydrogenation and other configurations with relatively high energies reported in reference [ 8 , 11 ] .",
    "the hydrogenation patterns of all above graphane allotropes can be divided in to two groups : 3up/3down and 4up/2down .",
    "interestingly , we notice that the hexagonal hydrocarbon rings in the most stable five graphane allotropes , namely chair , stirrup , boat-1 , boat-2 and twist - boat , are equivalent . as mentioned in reference",
    "[ 11 ] , there are many situations to hydrogenate a single six - carbon ring , such as 6u : uuuuuu ; 5u : uuuuud ; 4u : uuuudd , uuudud , and uuduud ; 3u : ududud , uududd , and uuuddd , 2u= 4u , etc . in present work , with the restrictive condition of keeping the hexagonal hydrocarbon rings equivalent in the systems , we propose a tricycle graphane allotrope where each hexagonal hydrocarbon rings with the same uuudud hydrogenation are equivalent .",
    "this new grahane holds remarkable stability comparable to the most stable chair one , becoming the second stable graphane allotrope .",

    "the lattice constants for chair ( p-3m1 ) and boat-1 ( pmmn ) graphane allotropes are ( a=2.504  , b=2.504  , c=15.0  ) and ( a=2.529  , b=4.309  , c=15.0  ) , respectively .",
    "the lattice constants , h - h bond length and c - c bond length for chair and boat-1 graphane allotropes are in good agreement with previous report@xcite . such consistency confirms the correctness of our calculations .",

    "we can see that the most thinnest is chair allotrope with a thickness of 2.6779  and the thickest tricycle allotrope holds thickness of 4.093  .",
    "the large thickness of tricycle graphane provides a possible way to identify its existence in experiments .",
    "surface work function provides another way to identify these potential graphane allotropes . from tab .",
    "[ tabii ] , we can see that the work function of the chair graphane is 3.916 ev , which is the smallest .",

    "one can identify these allotropes through the values of their surface work functions in field emission experiments .",
    "+      the relative stability of these allotropes can be evaluated through comparing their cohesive energy per atom ( e@xmath2 ) .",
    "low energy usually means high probability to be discovered in the same experimental condition . to evaluate the thermodynamic stability of these new allotropes of graphane",
    ", the gibbs free energy ( @xmath3 g ) is calculated according to @xmath3g = e@xmath2-@xmath4@xmath5-@xmath6@xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the cohesive energy per atom of the graphanes with different compositions , x@xmath9 means the molar fraction of atom i ( i = h , c ) in the structure with x@xmath10+x@xmath11=1 , and @xmath12 is the chemical potential of each constituent atom . the @xmath5 is chosen as the binding energy per atom of the h@xmath13 molecular and @xmath7 is the cohesive energy per atom of a single graphene .",
    "the calculated cohesive energies and gibbs free energies for all graphane allotropes are listed in tab .",
    "[ tabii ] .",
    "we can see that the most stable one is chair graphane .",
    "its negative @xmath3 g of -103 mev / atom indicates high probability to be synthesized from graphene and h@xmath1 .",
    "the tricycle graphane proposed is the second stable graphane allotrope with only 12 mev / atom of @xmath3 g above the most stable chair one , indicating that it may be produced in the process of graphene hydrogenation .",
    "it is amazing that this new allotrope with 4up/2down configuration is more stable than the stirrup one with 3up/3down configuration , which is contrary to the intuitive knowledge that balanced up and down hydrogenation configuration is more stable than that of unbalanced one , ( for example , chair and stirrup with 3up/3down hydrogenation are more stable than boat-1 and boat-2 with 4up/2down hydrogenation ) .",
    "stirrup graphane with uuuddd hydrogenation of 3up/3down is now the third stable conformer holding about 28 mev / atom of @xmath3 g larger than that of the chair one .",
    "the value of @xmath3gs for stirrup , boat-1 and boat-2 are -74 mev / atom , -52 mev / atom and -36 mev / atom , respectively .",
    "the negative @xmath3gs indicate that all of them may be produced in the process of graphene hydrogenation .",
    "the least stable graphane allotrope studied in our present work is the twist - boat one with uududd hydrogenation holding energy about 80 mev / atom larger than that of the chair one .",
    "however , its negative @xmath3 g of -28 mev / atom indicates that it can also be produced through the hydrogenation process from h@xmath1 and graphene .",
    "+     +          hydrogenation converts the hybridization of carbon atoms in graphene from sp@xmath14 to sp@xmath15 , inducing separation between the valence band and conduction band of graphene .",
    "all graphane allotropes with full coverage of hydrogen are direct - band - gap semiconductors with band gaps distributing in the range from 3.37 ev to 3.53 ev .",

    "[ fig3 ] is the local density of states within the energy widows of ( -0.5 ev , 3.5 ev ) and the charge density distributions of the homo and the lumo states for both systems are also shown in the figure . from [ fig3 ] ( a ) we can see that the homo states of chair graphane are mainly from p@xmath16 states of carbon atoms and the corresponding charge densities mainly distribute along the c - c bonds .",
    "its lumo states are from both the p@xmath16 states of carbon atoms and the s states of hydrogen atoms and the corresponding charge densities mainly distribute along the c - h bonds and the weak h - h bonds .",

    "homo states of tricycle graphane are mainly from the p@xmath16 states of carbon atoms as shown in fig .",

    "in summary , using first - principle calculations within the frame work of density functional theory , a tricycle graphane allotrope was proposed as the sixth fundamental graphane allotropes with a uuudud hydrogenation configuration satisfying the requirement of keeping each hexagonal hydrocarbon ring equivalent .",
    "our calculations indicate that tricycle graphane is the second stable one in the graphane allotropes family proposed so far .",
