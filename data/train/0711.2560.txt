    "recent superstring theory is confronted with the problem of the landscape @xcite .",
    "the problem is twofold .",
    "first , one needs to stabilize various moduli of a compact calabi - yau manifold .",
    "the second part of the problem is that there are many ways to do that , and the number of ways is even astronomically large .    in this letter",
    ", we consider instead superstrings on a calabi - yau three - fold with an isolated singularity .",
    "there are a number of reasons why such singular calabi - yau manifolds are of interest .",
    "first , since only the collapsing cycles are focused on , the number of moduli can be small , and the types of singularities are classified in a simple way .",
    "the second reason for the interest is that the noncompact gepner model construction offers a new framework for warped compactification of superstrings . finally , the third reason is that the set - up , by construction , escapes the no - go theorem against an accelerating universe @xcite .",
    "we first construct supersymmetric , modular invariant partition functions on the ade generalizations of the conifold including contributions from the discrete series of @xmath3 . using the character decomposition",
    ", we then show that there are massless matter fields in the discrete spectrum , which are hyper / vector multiplets in type iia / iib strings , and in the @xmath0 representation of @xmath1 in the @xmath2 heterotic case .",
    "this provides a picture of spacetime consisting of a warped product of a minkowski space and a two - dimensional euclidean black hole @xcite , where the massless matter is localized @xcite on a four - dimensional submanifold at the cigar tip .",
    "the chiral ring structure of the @xmath4 kazama - suzuki model was already investigated in @xcite .",
    "one of the virtues of the new partition function ( eq.([z_ade_new(tau ) ] ) ) is that it enables us to easily determine the lorentz quantum numbers of these discrete states , not only for type ii but for heterotic strings , which are automatically consistent with the gso projection in the continuous sector .    to avoid confusion",
    "it should be noted that , although our system may appear similar to the familiar warped deformed conifold geometry @xcite , there are the following differences : ( i ) we do not place any d - branes in the background conifold geometry .",
    "the localized modes are closed string modes coming from the geometric moduli of the calabi - yau , and not the open string modes on d - branes .",
    "( ii ) our picture of warped spacetime arises as an effective geometry of the gauged wzw model . while the whole system is a direct product of two ( 4d spacetime and 2d black hole ) cfts , the effective 6d metric",
    "is warped in the einstein frame because of the nontrivial dilaton profile of the black hole .",
    "this article is a highly compressed version of the report on our results .",
    "a detailed account of the material presented here will be given in a separate publication @xcite .",
    "a noncompact calabi - yau threefold with an isolated singularity of the ade type is described @xcite by a tensor product of the @xmath4 kazama - suzuki model @xcite at level @xmath5 and an @xmath6 minimal model at level @xmath7 .",
    "the central charge of the kazama - suzuki model is @xmath8 and that of the minimal model is @xmath9 .",
    "they must add up to nine , and hence @xmath10 .",
    "modular invariant partition functions for the kazama - suzuki model with contributions from both the continuous and discrete series of @xmath3 were derived in @xcite by the path - integral approach : @xmath11 where the expressions for other spin structures can be obtained by an obvious replacement of the theta function . by a poisson resummation we may write @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "they run over an appropriate direct sum of orthogonal lattices determined by @xmath15 .",
    "let us first consider the case @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) which corresponds to the conifold .",
    "the summation ( [ lattice_decomposition ] ) already looks like a product of theta functions and can be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "note that if @xmath15 , both of @xmath21 and @xmath22 must be either in @xmath23 or in @xmath24 because @xmath25 must be an integer when @xmath16 .",
    "but as we see below , in order to obtain a supersymmetric partition function , @xmath21 and @xmath22 must be allowed to take independent values , so that @xmath26 and @xmath27 must be allowed to take values in @xmath24 as well as in @xmath23 . in this paper",
    "we assume this to be the case .",
    "the first thing we notice in ( [ thetatheta ] ) is that the level-1 theta functions are precisely the ones to construct a modular invariant partition function on the conifold @xcite which contains only the continuous series of @xmath3 ( precisely speaking , the even @xmath7 case is subtle @xcite because some lower ends of the continuous spectra reach the boundary of the unitary region . if @xmath7 is odd , the lower bound is always above the boundary .",
    "see fig.1 . ) : @xmath28 where @xmath29 motivated by this observation , we define @xmath30 and write @xmath31 if we compare ( [ z_supersl2roveru1])([thetatheta ] ) with ( [ hatlambda1])([hatlambda2 ] ) , we see that @xmath32 is a partition function of the @xmath4 kazama - suzuki model coupled to a complex fermion , with a gso projection performed at the stage before the liouville limit is taken .",
    "in fact , we can show that @xmath32 ( i ) is modular invariant , ( ii ) reduces to ( [ z_conifold_old ] ) if , after a certain regularization @xcite , divided by a divergent volume factor and ( iii ) also contains contributions from the discrete series representations of @xmath33 .",
    "let us first prove the modular s - invariance .",
    "in general , we can show the following equation : @xmath34 for any divisor @xmath35 . in comparison with the case without @xmath36-dependences through @xmath37 , ( [ s - transformed_theta ] )",
    "has additional changes from ( 1 ) the exponential factor ( the 1st line ) ( 2 ) the replacement @xmath38 and ( 3 ) the shift of @xmath39 of @xmath40 by an amount of @xmath41 .",
    "let us now modular s - transform @xmath32 ( [ z_conifold_new(tau ) ] ) .",
    "first , we can see that the exponential factors from @xmath42 s and @xmath43 are precisely canceled by the change of @xmath44 . also",
    ", the replacement @xmath38 acts on @xmath32 trivially .",
    "so all we have to do is examine the effect of the index shifts in the theta functions .",
    "it turns out that they are also simple because they just induce a permutation of the two @xmath42 s .",
    "thus , by counting the numbers of theta s and eta s , we find that @xmath32 ( [ z_conifold_new(tau ) ] ) is modular s - invariant if @xmath45 ( [ z_conifold_old ] ) is .",
    "the latter statement was proven in @xcite , which completes the proof of the modular s - invariance of @xmath32 .",
    "next we turn to the modular t - invariance .",
    "since the equations @xmath46 , @xmath47 hold independently of @xmath37 , we have only to worry about the change of @xmath48 , which amounts to change of variables @xmath49 .",
    "fortunately , the integrand of @xmath32 ( [ z_conifold_new(tau ) ] ) is periodic ( with a period of 1 ) in @xmath50 , so the integral is invariant under the change of variables .",
    "thus @xmath32 is also t - invariant .",
    "taking into account the four - dimensional bosons , the total modular invariant partition function of type ii strings on the conifold is now given by @xmath51    we will now consider the ade generalizations of the conifold , which are described by a coupling to an ade modular invariant @xmath6 minimal model .",
    "we show only the result . for type ii strings",
    "the modular invariant partition function is given by @xmath52      @xmath54 is the coefficients of the ade modular invariant .",
    "we have used the same notation for @xmath6 minimal characters as in @xcite .",
    "we note the particular @xmath37-dependence of @xmath55 ( [ hatf ] ) , which is similar to @xmath56 defined in @xcite .",
    "the proof of the modular invariance is parallel to that in the conifold case .",
    "the only nontrivial point is the @xmath36-dependence through the @xmath37-argument . in the present case",
    "the modular s - transformation simply permutes @xmath57 s cyclically , and @xmath58 as a whole remains invariant .",
    "the proof of the modular t - invariance is also similar .",
    "conversion to heterotic string theories is also straightforward .",
    "since the transverse fermion theta s have no @xmath37-dependence , all we need to do is replace @xcite @xmath59 by @xmath60 , and @xmath61 by @xmath62 for @xmath2 ( @xmath63 ) ( for the transverse fermion theta s only ) , and in an analogous fashion for @xmath64 .",
    "then the partition functions remain modular invariant .",
    "we will now extract the discrete spectrum by using the technique developed in @xcite .",
    "we first express various theta functions in @xmath58 in terms of traces of some operators over appropriate hilbert spaces .",
    "we define ( @xmath65 ) :    *   @xmath66 as an @xmath3 current algebra module generated from a state @xmath67 such that @xmath68 satisfying @xmath69 . * @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) as a free fermion module such that @xmath72 , where if @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 denote the virasoro @xmath76 and fermion number operators in the ns sector , while if @xmath77 , they are the ones in the r sector .",
    "* @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) as a free boson module such that @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the @xmath82 charge operator . *",
    "@xmath83 as an irreducible module of minimal superconformal algebra such that @xmath84 .",
    "the @xmath50 integral yields a constraint @xmath87 . using the fourier transformation @xmath88 , the @xmath89 integral can also be done .",
    "we further use isomorphisms of various hilbert spaces ( spectral flows with respect to @xmath90 ) to find ( @xmath91 , @xmath5 ) @xmath92.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thanks to the isomorphisms we have used , the hilbert space of the first trace has been changed from that of @xmath93 to @xmath94 . as was done in @xcite",
    ", we will now change the integration contour of the first trace from @xmath95 to @xmath96 .",
    "then it picks up a residue of the pole at @xmath97 for the states satisfying @xmath98 .",
    "these negative - momentum states reside below the lower bound of the continuous spectrum , and precisely on the boundary of the unitary region @xcite .",
    "the unitary region of the @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) , @xmath6 superconformal algebra ( ns sector ) .",
    "green and red indicate , respectively , the continuous and discrete series representations contained in the spectrum . ,",
    "width=566 ]    we illustrate this in an example .",
    "fig.1 shows the discrete - series representations of @xmath6 superconformal algebra associated with the noncompact coset for @xmath101 ( @xmath100 ) in the ns - sector .",
    "the green lines are the continuous spectrum contained in the partition function , and the red points on the segments are the discrete states coming from the pole contributions .",
    "for the type ii case , the points a and b only give massless states .",
    "they come from poles in the orbits @xmath102 and @xmath103 ( after the isomorphisms ) , and with their superpartners they constitute a single vector- of a hyper - multiplet depending on the chirality .",
    "for the ( @xmath2 ) heterotic case , there are two additional points , a and b , in the left mover which contribute to massless states .",
    "various conformal weights of states which couple to these discrete states are shown in table.i .",
    "it turns out that a ( if paired with a in the right mover ) gives @xmath104 and a does a singlet of @xmath105 . with 16 states coming from the left ramond sector ,",
    "they constitute real scalars in the @xmath0 of @xmath1 .",
    "b , b and their corresponding left ramond states yield another @xmath0 .",
    "ttaking into account their superpartners and the symmetry @xmath106 , we find two @xmath107 massless scalar multiplets in the @xmath0 of @xmath1 localized at the cigar tip .    no massless graviton is localized ( nor massless gauge fields in the heterotic case ) , but if the noncompact calabi - yau is not the whole internal manifold itself but a part of some finite - size but large manifold compared to the scale of the collapsing cycles , which are isolated and distant from the rest , then there should be a massless graviton ( and gauge fields for heterotic strings ) associated with the constant mode , and they will interact with the localized fields .",
    "we hope that the singular cft compactifications we presented here will lead to a new , interesting realization of local @xmath1 gut with less moduli in this simple setting .",
