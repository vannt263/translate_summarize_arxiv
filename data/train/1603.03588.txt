    "for image alignment purposes , platinum structures were patterned on the film .",
    "these were deposited with focused electron beam deposition instead of focused ion beam in order to avoid damaging the membrane .",
    "the magnetic properties of the fegd films were characterized with magneto - optical kerr effect ( moke ) measurements in the polar geometry .",
    "the hysteresis loop of the @xmath81 thick film is given in figure [ fig : supp_1](a ) .",
    "the film has perpendicular magnetic anisotropy with a saturating field of @xmath82 .",

    "the out - of - plane magnetic hysteresis was investigated by measuring the xmcd signal with x - ray fluorescence as a function of magnetic field applied perpendicular to the sample surface .",
    "the hysteresis and non - zero - magnetization at remanence indicate that the sample also has an out - of - plane magnetization component .",
    "x - ray absorption spectroscopy experiments were performed at the id12 beamline of the european synchrotron radiation facility ( esrf ) , france at the @xmath70 edge of gd and at the @xmath1 edge of fe using a highly efficient fluorescence yield detection mode in a backscattering geometry @xcite . for the xmcd measurements ,",
    "circularly polarized x - rays generated by a helical undulator of the apple - ii type were used . at these photon energies",
    "the circularly polarized beam emitted by the helical undulator is reduced to @xmath85 , due to the partial suppression of horizontal polarization at the bragg angles of the si @xmath86 monochromator .",
    "the spectra were corrected for the incomplete circular polarization .",
    "the sample was inserted into the bore of a superconducting magnet .",
    "the measurements were carried out at room temperature and under a magnetic field of @xmath87 applied perpendicular to the sample surface .",
    "xmcd spectra were obtained as a difference of x - ray absorption spectra recorded with right and left circularly polarized x - rays . to ensure that the obtained xmcd spectra were free of any experimental artefacts ,",
    "the data were collected for both directions of the external magnetic field applied parallel and antiparallel to the incoming x - ray beam and the xmcd measurements compared and found to be equivalent .",
    "a reference spectrum for the phase xmcd was calculated using the kramers - kronig relations @xcite assuming the atomic density of bulk gadolinium ( @xmath88 ) and a nominal effective thickness of @xmath89 .",
    "this was compared with the phase part of the ptychographic xmcd data , @xmath90 .",

    "the illumination on the sample was defined by a combination of a @xmath93 central stop , a gold fresnel zone plate with @xmath94 gold thickness , @xmath95 outermost zone width , and @xmath96 diameter , and a @xmath97 diameter order - sorting aperture .",
    "the x - ray beam incident on the sample had a coherent flux of approximately @xmath98 photons / s and a spot size of @xmath99 .",
    "a diffraction pattern was measured at each of the scanning points with a 0.2 second exposure time using a single photon counting pilatus 2 m detector @xcite . to reduce air scattering and absorption",

    "measurements were taken at sixteen energies between @xmath100 and @xmath101 for the gd @xmath70 edge measurements . to enhance the signal - to - noise ratio , ten such scans were repeated for each energy .",
    "these scans were measured with left and right circularly polarized light .",
    "for the fe k edge measurements , ptychography was performed with @xmath23 polarized x - rays only due to time constraints . at ten energies between @xmath102 and @xmath103 ,",
    "sixty absorption images were measured and averaged .",
    "the quantitative xmcd values were obtained by fitting the histograms of the absorption xmcd contrast of the pixels of the positive and negative magnetic domains to gaussian distributions and calculating the mean and standard deviation .",
    "ptychographic reconstructions were performed with the data from @xmath104 pixels of the pilatus detector , resulting in a reconstruction pixel size of approximately 37 nm and 38 nm for measurements taken at the gd @xmath77 edge and fe k edge , respectively .    the algorithm initial guess was given by a uniform transmission for the object and an illumination obtained through a previous ptychography measurement on a strongly scattering test object . the initial guess for the illumination",
    "was numerically propagated for each different energy in the series to account for the dependence of the fresnel zone plate focal distance on the photon energy .",
    "the reconstructed images were aligned to a small fraction of a pixel @xcite and a linear phase ramp was removed from the images as in ref . before the images were averaged .",
    ".,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    a smoothly spatially varying phase artifact with an amplitude of a few milliradians was present in the reconstructions .",
    "the artifacts varied between different measurements and it is believed that they may arise in the reconstruction as a result of an algorithmic compensation mechanism for small changes in the probe wavefront . in order to correct for this artifact , the phase image was projected onto a two dimensional polynomial orthogonal basis using least - squares fitting similar to that performed in ref . .",
    "an example of this artifact and its subsequent removal is shown in figure [ fig : supp_4 ] for a single reconstruction .",
    "after normalization , ten images for each energy and polarization were averaged , and the @xmath68 and @xmath105 images were calculated . as discussed in the main text , ptychography assumes a scalar product interaction as follows : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the exit field after the sample , @xmath28 is the incident illumination , @xmath31 is the transmissivity of the sample , all complex - valued functions of @xmath32 , the transverse cartesian coordinates , and @xmath33 indicates the ptychography scan position.there is a certain amount of ambiguity when separating the reconstructed probe and object , and the absolute value of the reconstruction is subject to a multiplicative factor @xmath106 as follows : @xmath107 which translates to a multiplicative factor for the absorption part , and an additive offset to the phase part of the reconstruction . to obtain the quantitative absorption and absolute phase values ,",
    "the reconstructions were normalized by removing a phase offset and a multiplicative factor for the phase and absorption parts of the reconstructions , respectively . for a @xmath105 image ,",
    "the average phase of the reconstruction of either helicity was calculated by taking the mean phase value of an equal number of positive and negative domains , and the net offset between the two helicities removed to leave purely magnetic contrast .",
    "a value for @xmath108 was found from a reference transmission spectrum measured on a similar sample and used to normalize the absorption data . for a sample with an area of air within the image ,",

    "it can be seen that the expected phase contrast is much smaller than the absorption contrast.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the expected values for the relative xmcd contrast are given in terms of the real ( @xmath110 ) and imaginary ( @xmath111 ) parts of the scattering factor as @xmath112 ( black line ) and @xmath113 ( red dots ) for the gd @xmath0 edge and the fe @xmath1 edge in figures [ fig : supp_6](a ) and [ fig : supp_6](b ) , respectively .",
    "the real part of the scattering factor , @xmath110 , is calculated with the kramers - kronig relations from the spectra measured in fluorescence ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "this allows the strength of the phase ( @xmath114 ) and absorption ( @xmath113 ) magnetic contrast at the gd @xmath70 and fe @xmath1 edges to be compared .",
    "the expected absorption magnetic contrast , normalized by the total signal ( @xmath113 ) , is approximately 10 times weaker at the fe k edge than the gd @xmath70 edge .",
    "however , the expected phase magnetic contrast ( @xmath114 ) at the fe @xmath1 edge is almost 20 times weaker than at the gd @xmath70 edge , with a contrast of approximately @xmath115 for the @xmath51-thick fegd film .",
    "however , a layer of carbon was deposited on the surface of the film at the region of interest during the experiment due to the sample not being in a vacuum environment . as the phase signal of the carbon deposition ( @xmath116 ) was greater than the expected @xmath117 contrast , it was not possible to extract the @xmath117 contrast from the images at the fe k edge in this experiment .",

    "<S> imaging the magnetic structure of a material is essential to understanding the influence of the physical and chemical microstructure on its magnetic properties . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic imaging techniques , however , have up to now been unable to probe three dimensional micrometer - sized systems with nanoscale resolution . here </S>",
    "<S> we present the imaging of the magnetic domain configuration of a micrometer - thick fegd multilayer with hard x - ray dichroic ptychography at energies spanning both the gd @xmath0 edge and the fe @xmath1 edge , providing a high spatial resolution spectroscopic analysis of the complex x - ray magnetic circular dichroism . with a spatial resolution reaching @xmath2 , this advance in hard x - ray magnetic imaging </S>",
    "<S> is the first step towards the investigation of buried magnetic structures and extended three - dimensional magnetic systems at the nanoscale .    for optimal integration of new magnetic materials and systems into technological applications , a detailed understanding of the magnetic structure and properties is required . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , for the next generation of nanocomposite permanent magnets , which have the potential to enable more efficient , smaller and lighter energy harvesters and motors @xcite , an understanding of the influence of the physical and chemical microstructure on the magnetic configurations is of the utmost importance . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray imaging is an excellent candidate for such investigations @xcite , offering high spatial resolution , element specificity , high sensitivity , and the ability to directly and non - destructively probe the magnetization of a material . </S>",
    "<S> however , so far , all sub - micrometer spatial resolution x - ray magnetic imaging has been performed with soft x - rays , with photon energies below @xmath3 , due to the strong magnetic signal available in this regime @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> whilst effective for probing the magnetism of thin films and nanostructures @xcite , soft x - rays are limited to systems with total material thickness below approximately @xmath4 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> neutron magnetic imaging allows the study of systems with thicknesses ranging from micrometers up to millimeters but only with a spatial resolution of tens to hundreds of micrometers@xcite . as a result , high spatial resolution magnetic investigations of thick permanent magnets to be used in microsystems such as electromagnetic sensors and energy harvesting devices @xcite , as well as the study of buried structures integrated into , for example , silicon - based devices @xcite , have not been possible up to now .    </S>",
    "<S> higher energy x - rays offer a solution to such limitations , with recent advances providing nanometer spatial resolution imaging of structures with thickness on the order of many micrometers @xcite . for magnetic imaging , however , hard x - rays have so far not been considered to be competitive . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , soft x - rays , by utilizing the @xmath5 edges ( 2__p__-3__d _ _ ) of transition metals and the @xmath6 edges ( 3__d__-4__f _ _ ) of rare earths , directly probe the valence band of the magnetic material . in the hard x - ray regime , however , one indirectly probes the magnetization at the _ k _ ( 1__s__-4__p _ _ ) edges of transition metals and the @xmath5 ( 2__p__-5__d _ _ ) edges of rare earths , resulting in a significantly weaker magnetic signal @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , in previous studies of hard x - ray magnetic imaging a maximum spatial resolution of @xmath7 has been reached for the imaging of two dimensional objects @xcite .    here </S>",
    "<S> we present hard x - ray magnetic imaging at the nanoscale with a spatial resolution of @xmath2 . as a proof - of - principle , we image the magnetic domain configuration of a micrometer - thick fegd film at energies spanning not only the gd @xmath0 edge , with relatively strong magnetic contrast , but also the fe @xmath1 edge . while the magnetic signal is substantially weaker at the fe @xmath1 edge , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that we can image the magnetic configuration of the fe within the system , thus demonstrating the applicability of the technique to non - rare earth magnetic elements , which are of scientific interest as an important alternative to the scarce and expensive rare earth magnetic materials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a quantitative spectroscopic analysis of the full complex transmission function for energies spanning the gd @xmath0 edge , providing a detailed insight into the relationship between the phase and absorption xmcd signals and confirming the quantitative nature of the technique . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we measure the magnetic configuration of a film with a thickness of @xmath8 , therefore demonstrating the potential of the technique to investigate thinner films . with hard x - ray magnetic imaging with nanoscale resolution , the investigation of magnetic configurations of a wide range of samples is now possible .    in order to measure the weak magnetic signals in the hard x - ray regime , a high level of sensitivity </S>",
    "<S> is required , which is provided by ptychography . </S>",
    "<S> ptychography is a scanning coherent diffractive imaging technique , which gives access to the full complex transmission function of an object @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the sample is illuminated with a coherent beam , and far - field diffraction patterns are measured for many overlapping illumination positions . both the object and illumination functions </S>",
    "<S> are then retrieved using an iterative reconstruction algorithm @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when combined with three dimensional imaging techniques such as tomography , this access to the full complex transmission function provides a means to determine the three dimensional mapping of the electron @xcite and atomic densities @xcite within a sample .    </S>",
    "<S> when applied to magnetic imaging , coherent diffractive imaging ( cdi ) techniques such as ptychography offer high resolution imaging with a number of key advantages @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the complex magnetic signal provided by both cdi and ptychography makes possible the imaging of ferromagnetic domains with linearly polarized light . here </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic diffraction is isolated by subtracting the pure electronic scattering measured when the magnetic state is removed with a saturating magnetic field @xcite . in an investigation of the complex magnetic signal with soft x - ray holography </S>",
    "<S> it was reported that phase imaging before the absorption edge can minimize the radiation dose required @xcite .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we combine ptychography with x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) in the hard x - ray regime . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we study fegd multilayers , which are amorphous films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> xmcd is a resonant effect that occurs when the photon energy is tuned close to an atomic absorption edge . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic transitions between the resonant core level and the magnetically polarized valence band then become sensitive to the helicity of the x - rays and the projection of the sample s magnetization along the beam direction . </S>",
    "<S> experiments are typically performed by reversing the x - ray helicity and/or the sample magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> a more in - depth description of xmcd is given by , for example , ref . . </S>",
    "<S> in the case of ptychography , it is crucial to have a clear understanding of the complex index of refraction resulting from the interactions between the sample and the x - rays , especially when dichroic and birefringent effects can not be neglected as in xmcd . in particular , the assumption in standard ptychography that the probe and object are complex functions that interact via a scalar product may not hold @xcite .     or @xmath9 light , which is then focused close to the sample plane . </S>",
    "<S> a piezoelectric stage is used to scan the sample across the beam . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) the absorption part of reconstructed images taken with @xmath10 and @xmath9 polarized light at the gd @xmath0 edge with a photon energy of @xmath11 , which contain both electron density and magnetic contributions . </S>",
    "<S> the difference of these images removes the electron density contrast of pt reference structures on the sample to give a purely magnetic image , i.e. with xmcd contrast . </S>",
    "<S> scale bars represent @xmath12 . ]    for the case of x - rays interacting with a magnetic material , one must consider both the electronic and magnetic contributions to the scattering factor@xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the magnetization vector , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the jones polarization vectors of the incoming and scattered waves , respectively , @xmath17 denotes complex conjugation , and @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the complex - valued charge , circular and linear dichroic magnetic scattering factors , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> for the case of small angle scattering , and under the approximation of perfectly circularly polarized incoming photons and a non - birefringent interaction , as is the case for the amorphous film studied in this work , equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) is reduced to : @xmath21 for circularly right ( @xmath22 ) and left ( @xmath23 ) polarized incident light , there are therefore two non - zero matrix elements for the second term in equation ( 2 ) : the @xmath23-to-@xmath23 and the @xmath22-to-@xmath22 scattering channels , that are equal to @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the component of the magnetization along the propagation direction . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of @xmath20 has been neglected as both scalar products are approximately zero for the case of circularly polarized light and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy , where the magnetization and polarization vectors are perpendicular . </S>",
    "<S> the latter term in equation ( [ eq:2 ] ) is then the source of the xmcd signal that we probe with dichroic ptychography , and the result on the outgoing wave is a scalar addition to the scattering factor , which effectively results in a modification to the phase - shift and amplitude of the outgoing wave .    in considering a formalism for the ptychographic reconstructions , </S>",
