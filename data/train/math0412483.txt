    "a notorious open problem in geometric combinatorics and discrete and computational geometry is the question whether each continuous mass distribution @xmath7 in @xmath8 admits an _ equipartition _ by hyperplanes .",

    "@xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite , a connection with discrete and computational geometry was established @xcite @xcite and the subject grew into a separate branch of geometric combinatorics @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath9-equipartition problem itself has resisted all attempts and remains one of the central open problems in the field .    in this paper",
    "we prove , theorem  [ thm : plane ] , that a measure @xmath7 in @xmath8 admits a @xmath9-equipartition if it is symmetric with respect to a @xmath10-plane @xmath11 in @xmath8 .",

    "the _ configuration space / test map _",
    "scheme @xcite has emerged as one of the key principles for the application of topological methods in geometric combinatorics and discrete and computational geometry .",
    "the basic idea can be outlined as follows .",

    "this means that there is a group @xmath32 of symmetries of @xmath33 which acts on @xmath30 , such that @xmath29 is a @xmath32-invariant subspace of @xmath30 , which turns @xmath27 into an equivariant map . if a configuration @xmath34 with the desired property @xmath31 does not exist",
    ", then there arises an equivariant map @xmath35 .",
    "the final step is to show by topological methods that such a map does not exist .",
    "the reader can follow the genesis of the method in review papers @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite and see how the solutions of well known combinatorial problems like kneser s conjecture ( l.  lov ' asz @xcite ) , `` the splitting necklace problem '' ( n.  alon @xcite ) , the colored tverberg problem ( r.  ivaljevi ' c , s.  vre ' cica , @xcite @xcite ) etc .  eventually led to the formulation and codification of the general principle .",
    "our first choice for the configuration space suitable for the equipartition problem is the manifold of all ordered collections @xmath36 of oriented hyperplanes in @xmath37 .",

    "the group which acts on the configuration manifold @xmath25 is the reflection group @xmath49 where @xmath50 permutes the factors while the subgroup @xmath51 is in charge of the antipodal actions on individual spheres .",
    "the action of @xmath52 on @xmath48 is not free , so our third choice for the configuration space associated to the equipartition problem is @xmath53 this space is a relative of the ( standard ) `` configuration space '' @xmath54 @xcite .",
