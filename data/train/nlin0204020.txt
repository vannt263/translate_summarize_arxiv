    "the motion inside each cell consists of an amplified oscillation around a central point which translates towards the center of the cell .",

    "unfortunately , the direct problem is transcendent .",
    "moreover , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : t ] , its solution is strongly sensitive to the initial conditions .",
    "this fact is a direct consequence of the crossing time definition : @xmath77 is indeed determined by the intersection of an amplified oscillation and a decreasing exponential .",
    "a small change in the initial conditions may thus cause a discontinuous variation of the crossing time .",
    "this is the very origin of the system chaotic dynamics which suggests a stochastic treatment of the lorenz diffusion equation .",
    "despite the fact we have a three - dimensional space of parameters to investigate the model behaviors , the interesting region is actually a limited portion .",
    "this easily follows from the following simple considerations .",
    "for @xmath39 large enough in eq .  , the motion rapidly stops in one of the lattice fixed points . in order to have non trivial solutions ,",
    "the viscous coefficient must be smaller than a maximum value which can be explicitly derived from the condition @xmath78 @xmath79\\ , .\\ ] ] in the opposite limit , if @xmath39 is too small , the friction term is negligible with respect to the memory term , and the resulting motion is `` ballistic '' , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath80 ^ 2\\right > \\sim",
    "analogous considerations can be repeated for @xmath40 and @xmath41 . inside this region of parameters the lorenz diffusion equation generates a wide variety of behaviours : as we will see , the observed regimens are strongly sensitive to the control parameters , and furthermore this dependence is often in contrast with the intuitive meaning of @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath39 .    in fig .",
    "[ regimi ] a few numerical simulation of eq .   are shown , corresponding to different values of the parameters .",
    "these examples suggest that the variety of motion regimens ranges from `` ballistic '' ones to clearly `` diffusive '' , and even `` trapped '' in one cell or in groups of nearby cells .",
    "the analysis of the motion in the elementary cell shows that the system rapidly reaches a steady - state . in",
    "the diffusive regimens the points corresponding to subsequent cell entering conditions @xmath81 , @xmath82 are quickly attracted on a particular locus of the plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mappe ] ) . in the general situation",
    "this attracting set does not define a univocal map between the entering velocity and acceleration .",
    "however , it is not difficult to see that , for large @xmath73 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 satisfy the piecewise linear relation  @xcite @xmath85 if the diffusive regimen admits large enough times of permanence , the couple of straight lines defined by eq",
    ".   therefore belongs to the entering condition attracting set ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mappe ] ) .",
    "moreover , in the limiting case of very large @xmath70 the attracting set exactly reduces to such lines , and in the steady state eq .",
    "is satisfied by all entering conditions  @xcite .",

    "[ regimi ] , different values of the control parameters can lead to qualitatively very different diffusive motions .",
    "what is surprising is that the change of regimen is very irregular and abrupt with @xmath87 , and sometimes it does not reflect our intuition on the role played by the parameters in eq .  .",
    "for instance , @xmath87 shows a non - monotonic dependence on the viscosity @xmath39 ( fig .",
    "[ rison ] ) , and it is possible to observe transitions from trapped ( or diffusive ) motion to ballistic ones even by increasing the viscosity itself ( table  [ table : d ] ) .    despite the somehow strange aspect of some system trajectories , it should be stressed that no anomalies ( _ i.e. _ superdiffusive transport ) have been encountered in the statistical analysis of diffusion , the distribution of long flies having always exponential tails .",

    "two main problems should still be tackled .",
    "first , the diffusion coefficient seems to have a fractal dependence on the control parameters , as observed for other discrete chaotic maps  @xcite .",
