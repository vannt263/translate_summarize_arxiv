    "to understand the existence of various hierarchical scales in nature is one of the most important problem in particle physics .",
    "recently it was proposed in  @xcite that the existence of extra spacetime dimensions may solve the gauge hierarchy problem between the planck and weak scales in four dimensions .",
    "stimulated by their work , there have appeared a large number of papers concerning the physics of extra dimensions .",
    "they deal with various phenomenological problems , such as fermion mass hierarchy  @xcite , neutrino physics  @xcite , supersymmetry breaking  @xcite , flavor problems  @xcite , cosmology and astrophysics  @xcite , and so on .",
    "it is really an interesting possibility that our four - dimensional world may lie on a ` brane ' like a d - brane , orientifold plane , domain wall , etc .",
    "embedded in larger dimensions  @xcite .",
    "what are then typical signatures for such a brane world ?",
    "since there can not exist a rigid body in the relativistic theory , any type of brane must necessarily fluctuate .",
    "therefore there are always scalar fields which stand for the coordinates of the brane in the transverse dimensions .",
    "these scalar fields are the nambu - goldstone ( ng ) bosons which appear as a result of spontaneous breaking of the translation symmetry by the presence of the brane .",
    "then one important way to explore the possibility of brane world is to investigate the effects of this ng bosons .    in higher dimensional models where the gravity and/or gauge fields live in the bulk ,",
    "there are infinite numbers of kaluza - klein ( kk ) gravitons and/or kk gauge bosons on the brane .",
    "they couple to the matters living on the brane ( our world ) and can give visible effects in future collider experiments and astrophysics .",
    "these effects have been intensively investigated so far in many articles  @xcite . however , in calculating some processes with kk excitation modes , there was a puzzling problem .",
    "that is , in summing up infinitely many kk modes , a _ tree - level _ amplitude diverges when the number of extra dimensions is larger than or equal to 2 . in the previous work  @xcite , we showed that the higher kk mode couplings to the fields confined on the brane are exponentially suppressed if the effect of the above mentioned ng bosons is properly taken into account .",
    "that is , the suppression is due to the fluctuation of the brane .",
    "the suppression factor works as a regulator in the summations of kk mode contributions and cures the problematic divergences .",
    "we also discussed some important phenomenological consequences of this factor .",
    "there , we concluded that if the brane tension is very small , the kk mode contributions become completely invisible from our world .    in this paper",
    ", we will consider the effects of other interactions of this ng field and then show that we can not freely have a small value for the brane tension .",
    "for this purpose , we will examine two physical phenomena .",
    "one is a new long - range force mediated by the ng bosons and the other is the cooling process of neutron stars in the supernova explosions . both results involve the brane tension parameter @xmath0 ( the decay constant of the ng boson ) in the form @xmath1 and lead to sizable effects if the tension becomes very small . that is , when the brane tension becomes small the kk mode couplings are suppressed but instead the effects of the ng bosons can be measured .",
    "therefore , we do not miss the possibilities of finding signatures of the extra dimensions in near future .    to discuss the effects of the ng bosons ,",
    "we need explicitly construct the effective action on the brane .",
    "the construction of the action is more or less similar to that in the string theory , and is straightforward in principle , as was done in ref .",
    "although the author of ref .  @xcite has given a definition of the induced vielbein , he unfortunately gave only a perturbative procedure for finding its form in terms of the bulk gravity and the brane coordinates ( ng fields ) . since it seems to have appeared in no literature , we give an explicit expression for the induced vielbein in this paper .",
    "the details of the derivation of the explicit form , together with its relevance to the non - linear realization theory , are given in appendix a.    this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we give the effective action for the system of the @xmath2-dimensional brane embedded in a higher dimensional spacetime where the gravity and gauge fields live in the bulk and the matter fields only in the brane .",
    "the ng boson part of this action is discussed in some detail in section 3 .",
    "given those interactions in the flat background , we consider several phenomenological effects of the ng field in section 4 .",
    "comparing them with observations , we can obtain constraints for physical parameters of extra dimensions such as the brane tension stated above .",
    "section 5 is devoted to summary of this paper .",
    "appendixes b and c are added for the calculations of the fifth force potential and of the cross sections for the two processes relevant to the star cooling .",
    "the brane action is basically well - known in string theory  @xcite .",
    "so we here explain the setup briefly which we use throughout this paper , and construct the action for the system , in particular , by presenting the explicit form of the induced vierbein .",
    "we take the brane to be a @xmath3-brane whose world volume topology is @xmath4 .",
    "it is embedded in the bulk spacetime of dimension @xmath5 with topology @xmath6 , where @xmath7 denotes a @xmath8-dimensional torus .",
    "the coordinates of the bulk spacetime are denoted @xmath9 , and those of the brane world volume are denoted @xmath10 .",
    "the indices of upper - case roman letters from the middle , @xmath11 run over all dimensions , @xmath12 and the greek letter indices @xmath13 run only over the first @xmath2 dimensions , @xmath14 , while the lower - case roman letters @xmath15 run over the rest @xmath16-dimensions , @xmath17 ; namely , we write like @xmath18 . the local lorentz indices are denoted similarly by the corresponding letters from the beginning of the alphabet , like @xmath19 .",

    "considering the distance between two points @xmath37 and @xmath38 on the brane and the parallel transport of a charged field from @xmath37 to @xmath38 , we see that the following metric and gauge fields are induced on the brane from the bulk ones , @xmath28 and @xmath27 : @xmath39 similarly , a vielbein @xmath40 on the brane is also induced from the bulk one @xmath26 .",
    "the definition of this induced vielbein is , however , a bit non - trivial problem as was discussed by sundrum  @xcite and hence is explained in detail in appendix a. we derive there an explicit form of the induced vielbein , which we need to discuss the phenomenological implications of the ng bosons .",
    "the explicit form is given by @xmath41 where we have defined @xmath42 and @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the inverse matrix of @xmath46 .",
    "this vielbein satisfies the condition , @xmath47 and gives a matrix connecting the local lorentz basis to the curved one on the brane .",

    "the fields living on the brane generally couple to the bulk fields through these induced vielbein ( or metric ) and yang - mills fields .",

    "the ellipsis contains other bosonic part terms for scalars and gauge fields if there exist such fields living only on the brane .",
    "these terms can be easily written by using the induced metric @xmath58 .",
    "it should be noted that the total system with the action @xmath59 still keeps the gauge invariance under the bulk general coordinate , local lorentz and yang - mills gauge transformations . under the bulk general",
    "coordinate transformation , the induced fields @xmath60 as well as the genuine field @xmath53 on the brane , all transform as scalar fields .",
    "this can be checked easily from the equations ( [ inducedym])([caly ] ) if we note that @xmath61 transforms as bulk vectors .",
    "the bulk local lorentz transformation results in an @xmath62 local lorentz transformation on the induced vielbein @xmath40 on the brane ( see appendix a ) , but @xmath21 is manifestly invariant under any @xmath62 local lorentz transformation .",
    "moreover , under the bulk yang - mills transformation @xmath63 , the induced gauge field @xmath64 is transformed as @xmath65 this is the usual gauge transformation in @xmath2-dimensions with @xmath66 , under which @xmath21 is manifestly invariant .",
    "the brane action @xmath21 also has an invariance under reparametrization of the world volume coordinates @xmath10 as is familiar in string theory  @xcite .",
    "we fix this reparametrization invariance by choosing the gauge condition ( the static gauge ) @xmath67 namely , we identify the world volume coordinates @xmath10 with the first @xmath2 components of the brane coordinate @xmath36 in the bulk . then , the remaining @xmath16 components @xmath68 represent the brane coordinates transverse to the brane and behave as dynamical scalar fields on the brane .",
    "they are the ng fields appearing as a result of spontaneous breaking of the translation symmetries transverse to the brane .",
    "if we take a suitable gauge fixing also for the local lorentz invariance in the bulk , the induced vielbein can be written in a simpler form .",
    "let us take the following local lorentz gauge as is usually adopted in the case of dimensional reduction : @xmath69    e_{\\ a}^{m } & = & \\pmatrix {      e_{\\ \\alpha}^\\mu & e_{\\ a}^\\mu=0 \\cr      e_{\\",

    "they correspond to the gauged translational symmetry in the extra dimension .",
    "now , since the translations are spontaneously broken by the existence of the brane , these gauge fields absorb the ng bosons @xmath79 and become massive on the brane . in the above expression of the induced vielbein ( [ vb ] ) , we can see a part of this higgs effect .",
    "that is , the gauge fields @xmath77 appear only in the form of @xmath80 which correspond to the massive gauge fields .",

    "the energy - momentum tensor @xmath106 is given by @xmath107 assuming @xmath95 symmetric .",
    "here we have neglected the interaction terms between the fluctuations of bulk metric and the ng field , which are higher - order terms in the gravitational coupling constant and @xmath108 .    from the above action",
    ", we can see that there are two types of coupling between the ng boson @xmath88 and the fields on the brane .",

    "we should rewrite the exponential factor into a normal ordered form @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the free propagator of @xmath88 @xmath120 in deriving this , a singularity at @xmath121 is cut off at the fundamental scale @xmath98 above which the effective theory description on the brane becomes invalid . the interaction term ( [ normal ] )",
    "implies that the effective coupling of the level @xmath122 kk modes to @xmath2-dimensional fields is suppressed exponentially .",
    "it should be noted that the same exponential factor also appears in the coupling with the kk gravitons @xmath123 ( [ sgrav ] ) . in the following section , we consider the effects of the ng boson @xmath90 with the derivative interaction terms in ( [ sng ] ) and non - derivative one ( [ normal ] ) .",
    "we will see that these two interaction terms play complementary roles in obtaining the limits for the parameters of the model .    here",
    "we comment on the coupling involving the bulk gauge filed @xmath124 in the action ( [ sng ] ) .",
    "when we perform a compactification from higher @xmath25-dimensional theories , the kk modes @xmath125 for the bulk gauge fields get masses and so should absorb the physical degrees of freedom from some scalar fields .",
    "these are just supplied by the kk excitations @xmath126 of the extra - dimensional components ; i.e. , the induced gauge field ( [ induceda ] ) can be rewritten in the form @xmath127     + ( { \\rm zero~ mode}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath128 are massive gauge fields on the brane ( with mass @xmath129 ) which are invariant ( covariant in the non - abelian case ) under the gauge transformation in @xmath25 dimensions .",
    "since the induced gauge fields only appear in the minimal interactions to brane fields , the second term can be absorbed by a redefinition of those fields ( a gauge transformation ) . in the following , the kaluza - klein gauge fields @xmath125",
    "should be understood as this massive gauge field @xmath130 .",
    "it should be noted that in the above equation , the zero mode part contains the zero modes of extra components @xmath124 which remains massless . since such massless ` scalar ' fields in the adjoint representation have not been experimentally observed , they must be removed from the low - energy effective theories .",
    "of course , it is not necessary that gauge fields are living in the bulk unlike the graviton .",
    "the effects of the ng field , which we will discuss below , actually exist even when the gauge fields are confined on the brane to start with .",
    "however , if one wish to consider bulk gauge fields , one should incorporate some mechanism , such as non - trivial compactifications , in order to remove such adjoint scalars .",
    "in this section , we investigate the effects of the nambe - goldstone field @xmath90 on our four - dimensional world using the action obtained in the previous section .",
    "we take the dimension of our brane @xmath103 and denote the number of extra dimensions @xmath131 .",
    "it is also simply assumed that as in the usual case , the gravity ( and sometimes the standard gauge fields , too ) live in the bulk and the other matter fields are all confined in the four - dimensional brane . for simplicity",
    ", we use a dimension one parameter @xmath0 for the brane tension in the following : @xmath132    strictly speaking , when we take the bulk gravity turned on , the ng bosons @xmath133 are absorbed by the zero modes of the off - diagonal components of the bulk metric , @xmath77 , and the latter become massive .",
    "their masses , however , become of the order @xmath134  @xcite ( @xmath135 is the planck mass in four dimensions ) , and very small compared to the energy scales which we will consider . therefore , we need not take into account this higgs effect thanks to the equivalence theorem  @xcite , and will treat @xmath88 ( and graviton zero modes ) to be massless fields .",
    "first , we briefly review the results of ref .",
    "@xcite about the couplings ( [ normal ] ) between the brane fields and the bulk ones . as we will see below",
    ", the couplings can exponentially reduce the contributions of higher kk modes and potentially make their effects invisible in our four - dimensional world .",
    "the form of the interaction term ( [ normal ] ) now implies that the effective coupling @xmath136 of the level @xmath122 kk mode to four - dimensional fields is actually suppressed exponentially : @xmath137 the origin of this suppression is a recoil effect of the brane .",
    "this is easily seen if we note that the effective couplings @xmath136 can be written as @xmath138 by using the perturbative vacuum @xmath139 of the ng bosons @xmath88 . remembering that @xmath90 stand for the transverse coordinate , the operator @xmath140 is just like the vertex operator in the string theory and gives transverse momentum @xmath141 to the brane around the point @xmath37 .",
    "hence , @xmath142 represents the recoiled state of @xmath88 by the absorption ( emission ) of the level @xmath122 kk mode carrying transverse momentum @xmath141 ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "thus the amplitude @xmath144 can be viewed as a probability amplitude of containing the original state @xmath145 in the recoiled state @xmath146 .",
    "as is clear from this view , the suppressions become stronger for higher kk modes since larger deformation of the brane occurs , and on the other hand , in the case of _ stiff _ brane possessing large @xmath0 , the suppression is weak .",
    "let us discuss a phenomenological consequence of this new suppression factor .",
    "consider a tree - level amplitude for the two charged - particle scattering in the brane caused by the exchange of kk gauge bosons which live in the bulk .",
    "this leads to a correction to the effective four - fermi coupling constant @xmath147 .",
    "the summation over all the kk modes in the amplitude becomes @xmath148 where we have assumed the momentum transfer is small compared with @xmath149 ( and then @xmath150 ) .",
    "if the couplings of kk modes were universal , @xmath151 , this amplitude diverges when the dimensions transverse to the brane are greater than one .",
    "this is something wrong because it is merely a tree - level amplitude and the divergence can not be renormalized by any means . in the recent analyses on the experimental implications of such kk modes contributions",
    ", the sum has simply been cut off at the fundamental scale @xmath98 .",
    "however , we see above that such divergences are automatically cured as it should by properly taking into account the brane fluctuations ( the fluctuations of @xmath88 ) .    for a numerical estimation , we simply consider the @xmath152 case , but it is straightforward to include more numbers of extra dimensions . the correction ( [ an ] ) is dominated by the first mode contributions ( with @xmath153 ) since the higher modes are further suppressed by the presence of exponential factors , so that the kk mode correction @xmath154 to the four - fermi coupling constant can be estimated as @xmath155 since the standard model prediction precisely agrees with experiments , the kk mode correction ( [ corr ] ) must be small , say @xmath156  @xcite . for definiteness , we consider @xmath150 in the range @xmath157 , then the constraint @xmath158 reads @xmath159 this constraint gives a weak upper bound to the brane tension ; @xmath160 tev , depending on the value of @xmath98 .",
    "clearly , since @xmath161 < 1 $ ] , no constraint appears if @xmath150 is larger than @xmath162 tev . even for @xmath150 less than this",
    ", the constraint ( [ const ] ) can be easily satisfied for any value of @xmath98 provided that @xmath0 is chosen suitably small .",
    "therefore , if the brane fluctuation is taken into account ,",
    "the constraints on the extra dimensions ( @xmath163 ) so far obtained can be substantially loosened and sometimes disappear . in the case of @xmath164 , since the exponential damping factor appears for each extra dimension , it is clear that the suppression factor becomes @xmath165 and then , the constraint of @xmath0 is further weaker .    finally , it should be noted that the exponential suppressions discussed above also work in the couplings of the kk gravitons to the matters on the brane .",
    "this fact will have important effects in later analyses .      in the previous section",
    ", we have shown that the contributions from all kk excited modes are suppressed if the brane tension @xmath0 takes a moderately small value .",
    "then , we unfortunately could not find signatures of the presence of large extra dimensions unless there is a lower bound for @xmath0 . in section 3 , we have seen two types of interaction terms for the ng field @xmath90 involving the coupling @xmath0 .",
    "one is the exponential couplings between the brane fields and the bulk ones whose effect was discussed before .",
    "it gave only upper bounds of @xmath0 .",
    "expanding the exponential interaction , we also have the @xmath122 ng boson coupling whose strength in general takes the form @xmath166 $ ] .",
    "this factor takes a _",
    "maximum _ value at @xmath167 , which is independent of @xmath0 , and so can not be used to give a lower bound for @xmath0 either . on the other hand",
    ", another type of couplings in the lagrangian ( [ sng ] ) , coming from the expansion of the vierbein , has strength proportional to @xmath168 .",
    "as the brane tension becomes smaller , its effects become larger and may easily be detected . in the following two sections",
    ", we will calculate various phenomena which involve the latter coupling , and show that relatively severe lower bounds can be obtained .",
    "first , we discuss a constraint from the so - called `` fifth force '' .",
    "so far , various types of new long range forces mediated by hypothesized very light particles have been suggested in many theoretical frameworks  @xcite .",
    "we here consider the strength of a long range force which arises as a consequence of exchanges of the ng scalar @xmath88 , which could be potentially observable .",
    "in the macroscopic range , the dominant force working between neutral systems is gravity .",
    "the newton s universal law of gravitation ( the inverse - square distance dependence ) has been experimentally tested up to 1 cm range , and new forces which are comparable to gravity have been excluded to this range  @xcite .",
    "this fact restricts the potential forms of new forces and imposes the bounds for new couplings which determine the potentials . in the present model ,",
    "this just results in a lower bound for @xmath0 .",
    "as seen from the effective lagrangian on the brane , the ng mediated force between two distinguishable standard fermions with masses @xmath169 and @xmath170 is calculated from the one - loop diagram in the leading order of @xmath171 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "( -103,53)@xmath88 ( -47,53)@xmath88    note that since a single @xmath88 does not have tree - level couplings to the standard fermions , this two - particle exchange is the leading contribution .",
    "this is because in the action on the brane , there is an @xmath172 internal symmetry under which @xmath88 transform as a vector .",
    "so , unlike the case of yukawa force mediated by massless scalars , the above new force at a distance @xmath173 is expected to behave as @xmath174 .",
    "we calculate the above amplitude in the non - relativistic limit and extract the two - body potential @xmath175 from it .",
    "when we now consider a loop diagram and a higher - order correction to gravity , a convenient way to compute the two - body potential is the dispersion theoretical method  @xcite .",
    "this method gives a following relation between the potential @xmath175 and invariant scattering amplitude @xmath176 obtained from feynman diagrams , @xmath177 where @xmath178 denotes the momentum transfer ( that is now used beyond the physical region ) and @xmath179 is the discontinuity of amplitude across the branch cut on the real @xmath178 axis ; @xmath180 .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain the expressions for long range potentials we have only to calculate the @xmath178-channel discontinuity and perform a laplace transformation .",
    "the discontinuity of amplitudes can be evaluated by a simple prescription resulting in the replacement of each propagator by its discontinuity ( delta function ) multiplied by a theta function to insure a positive energy  @xcite ; @xmath181 for the above diagram , we obtain for @xmath179 in the non - relativistic limit neglecting the higher - order contributions of three - momenta , @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the number of extra dimensions .",
    "we here have used a formula @xmath184 where two totally symmetric sums are defined as @xmath185 as a result , we see that this force has a potential @xmath186 implying an attractive long range force . in appendix b ,",
    "we show another derivation of this result by using more conventional method .    before performing numerical comparisons with the experiments ,",
    "we here give several comments on other possible contributions besides the above potential .",
    "first , there is a contribution from the massive kk gravitons .",

    "thus the factor @xmath347 is replaced by a finite one @xmath348 with a suitable renormalization scale @xmath233 .    in the low energy limit , the amplitude is dominated by the @xmath349 components and reduces to @xmath350 where we have used @xmath351 and replaced @xmath352 and @xmath353 by the matter net masses @xmath169 and @xmath170 , respectively .    to obtain the potential ,",
    "let us now evaluate the fourier transform : @xmath354 this is divergent in the ultraviolet region @xmath355 .",
    "however , the amplitude @xmath356 is reliable only in the infrared region and the true amplitude should be suppressed well in the ultraviolet region .",
    "supposing so , we put here a suppression factor @xmath357 , or making a replacement @xmath358 , in the integrand and so understand that the obtained result is reliable only for large @xmath173 .",
    "then , we can rotate the integration contour @xmath359 counterclockwise into that along the imaginary axis , @xmath360 with @xmath361 since the contribution from the quarter circle at infinity vanishes thanks to the factor @xmath362 . putting @xmath363",
    ", we then obtain @xmath364 thus the desired potential is found to be @xmath365 where the overall negative sign has been put since the amplitude @xmath176 corresponds to the effective action which has opposite sign to the potential energy .",
    "the amplitude for the production process ( a ) in fig .",
    "2 of the level @xmath122 kk graviton @xmath366 is calculated using the gravity interaction term ( [ sgrav ] ) and is given by @xmath367 where @xmath368 is the @xmath122-th kk graviton coupling strength suppressed by the brane fluctuation effect , and @xmath369 is the polarization tensor of the massive kk graviton .",
    "the initial - spin averaged cross section in the center - of - mass frame is given by the standard formula : @xmath370 where @xmath371 , and @xmath372 denotes the summation over the level number @xmath122 of the final kk graviton .",
    "henceforth we will set the small electron mass @xmath373 equal to zero .",
    "the spin sum for the final massive kk graviton is done by using @xmath374 where the ellipses denote the terms containing @xmath375 ( @xmath376 ) , which all do not contribute to the cross section because of the energy - momentum tensor conservation .",
    "the third term @xmath377 does not contribute either since the energy - momentum tensor is traceless when @xmath378 .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath379 the mass of the level @xmath122 kk graviton is given by @xmath380 which equals @xmath381 in the center - of - mass frame , and so the summation @xmath372 over @xmath122 can be replaced by the integral @xmath382 with the solid angle @xmath383 in @xmath183-dimensions .",
    "using also the relation @xmath384 , we finally get @xmath385    the amplitude for the ng boson pair production process ( b ) in fig .",
    "2 is calculated using the interaction term ( [ sng ] ) and is given by @xmath386 the initial - spin averaged cross section in the center - of - mass frame @xmath387 is given by the standard formula : @xmath388 where the factor @xmath389 in front is put because the final two particles are of the same kind , and the factor @xmath183 comes from the sum over the index @xmath169 of the ng bosons @xmath133 . since we are neglecting @xmath373 presently , we have @xmath390 , and @xmath391 with @xmath392    99 i.  antoniadis , _ phys .  lett . _ * 246b * ( 1990 ) 377 ; j.d .",
