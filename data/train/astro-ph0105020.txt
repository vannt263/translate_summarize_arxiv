    "the abundance of clusters of galaxies provides one of the strongest constraints on cosmological models ( peebles , daly , & juszkiewicz 1989 ; bahcall & cen 1992 ; white , efstathiou , & frenk 1993 ; viana & liddle 1996 ; eke , cole , & frenk 1996 ; oukbir , bartlett , & blanchard 1997 ; bahcall , fan , & cen 1997 ; pen 1998 ; cen 1998 ; henry 2000 ; wu 2000 ) with an uncertainty on the amplitude of density fluctuations of about 10% on @xmath5mpc scale .",
    "theoretically it is often desirable to translate the mass of a cluster , that is predicted by either analytic theories such as press - schechter ( 1974 ) theory or n - body simulations , to the temperature of the cluster , which is directly observed .",
    "simple arguments based on virialization density suggest that @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the temperature of a cluster within a certain radius ( e.g. , the virial radius ) and @xmath8 is the mass within the same radius . however , the proportionality coefficient has not been self - consistently determined from first principles , although numerical simulations have frequently been used to calibrate the relation ( e.g. , evrard , metzler , & navarro 1996 , hereafter emn ; bryan & norman 1998 ; thomas et al . 2001 ) .",
    "it is noted that the results from different observational methods of mass measurements are not consistent with one another and with the simulation results ( e.g. , horner , mushotzky , & scharf 1999 , hereafter hms ; neumann , & arnaud 1999 ; nevalainen , markevitch , & forman 2000 , finoguenov , reiprich , & bohringer 2001 , hereafter frb ) . in general , x - ray mass estimates are about @xmath9 lower than the predictions of hydro - simulations . fig 1 compares x - ray cluster observational data with best fit line to emn simulation results ( frb ) . on the other hand ,",
    "mass estimates from galaxy velocity dispersion seem to be consistent with simulation results ( hms ) .",
    "the error in the gravitational lensing mass measurements is still too big to distinguish between these two ( hjorth , oukbir & van kampen 1998 ) .",
    "another recent observational finding is the possible existence of a break in the @xmath10 relation . by use of resolved temperature profile of x - ray clusters observed by asca",
    ", frb have investigated @xmath10 relation in the low - mass end and find that @xmath11 , compared to @xmath12 at the high mass end .",
    "suggestions have been made to explain this behavior by attributing it the effect of formation redshift ( frb ) , cooling ( muanwong 2001 ) and heating ( bialek , evrard & mohr 2000 ) processes .    in this paper",
    "we use conservation of energy for an almost spherically collapsing region to derive the m - t relation . in  2 we find the initial and final energy of the cluster .",
    " 3 constrains various factors which enter the normalization of m - t relation , via statistical methods , simulation and observational input .",
    " 4 considers predictions of our model and comparison with observational and simulation results . in  5 , we discuss the limitations of our approach and justify some of the approximations .",
    " 6 concludes the paper .",
    "we begin by deriving the kinetic energy of the proto - cluster . we can write velocity as a function of gravitational potential @xmath13 ( e.g. padmanabhan 1993 ) : @xmath14 at the initial time in the linear regime , where @xmath15 is the hubble constant at the initial time .",
    "there is a small dependence on the initial density parameter @xmath16 in equation ( 1 ) which we ignore since initially it is very close to unity and the difference will be in second order terms that we ignore for the proto - cluster .",
    "then the kinetic energy is given by : @xmath17 keeping the terms up to the linear order we obtain @xmath18 in deriving equation ( 3 ) , we have used the poisson equation : @xmath19 to substitute for @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the initial mean density of the universe . for equation ( 3 )",
    "we then use gauss theorem to make the third term similar to the second , at the expense of a surface term : @xmath22 assuming that the deviations from spherical symmetry is not important at the boundary of the proto - cluster , we find @xmath23 in the second term in equation ( 5 ) as a function of @xmath20 : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the gravitational constant and @xmath26 is the boundary radius of the initial proto - cluster , which leads to @xmath27 d^3x,\\ ] ] where we have used equation ( 4 ) to substitute back for @xmath13 and also the definition of @xmath28 .",
    "let us now find an expression for the gravitational potential energy of the proto - cluster .",
    "using its definition we have @xmath29d^3x_1   d^3x_2.\\ ] ] keeping the terms to the first order and using the symmetry under interchange of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , we arrive at @xmath32 which , taking the second integral in a spherical volume , gives @xmath33    adding equations 7 and 10 gives the total initial energy and so we have neglected it in the first order terms . ]",
    "@xmath34,\\ ] ] to the first order .",
    "defining @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 as : @xmath38 equation ( 11 ) is simplified : @xmath39 the integral in the definition of @xmath37 is in fact a three dimensional integral and the limits denote that the integration domain is the unit sphere .",
    "note that @xmath36 can be considered as the density perturbation to a flat ( i.e. @xmath40 ) universe for which energy vanishes .",
    "another aspect of this statement is that both terms in the definition of @xmath36 scale as @xmath41 in the early ( matter dominated ) universe and so does @xmath36 itself . for a flat universe the first term dominates at high redshift since the second term scales as @xmath42 .      according to the virial theorem , the sum of the total energy @xmath43 of a virialized cluster and its kinetic energy @xmath44 vanishes .",
    "however , non - vanishing pressure at the boundary of the cluster can significantly modify the virial relation . integrating the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium , we have @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the pressure on the outer boundary of virialized region ( i.e. virial radius ) and v is the volume .",
    "for now we assume that the surface term is related to the final potential energy @xmath47 by @xmath48 we will consider the coefficient @xmath49 and its possible mass dependence in  3.4 . for a system of fully ionized gas plus dark matter , the virial relation ( 14 ) with equation ( 15 ) leads to @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the mass - weighted mean one - dimensional velocity dispersion of dark matter particles , @xmath52 is the total dark matter mass , @xmath53 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath54 is the mean molecular weight and @xmath55 is the proton mass . assuming that the ratio of gas to dark matter mass in the cluster is the same as that of the universe as a whole and @xmath56 is the fraction of the baryonic matter in the hot gas",

    "defining @xmath66 as the energy of a test particle with unit mass , which is at the boundary of the cluster @xmath26 of mass @xmath8 initially : @xmath67 the collapse time @xmath68 can be written as @xmath69 following the top - hat model , we assume that the collapse time of the particle is approximately the same as the time necessary for the particle to be virialized . choosing @xmath68 to be the time of observation and assuming the mass @xmath8 , interior to the test particle is virialized at @xmath68 , and by combing equations ( 1 , 6 , 22 ) , we find @xmath66 as function of initial density distribution and relate it to the collapse time : @xmath70 using @xmath71 and the friedmann equations we obtain @xmath72      combining equations ( 20 ) and ( 13,24 ) , we arrive at the cluster temperature - mass relation : @xmath73 notice that although @xmath37 and @xmath74 are both functions of the initial moment @xmath75 , since both are proportional to the scale factor @xmath41 , the ratio is a constant ; the derived t - m relation ( equation 25 ) does not depend on the adopted initial time , as expected . as a specific example , in the spherical top - hat model in which the density contrast is assumed to be constant , this ratio @xmath76 is @xmath77 .",
    "let us gather all the unknown dimensionless factors in @xmath78 : @xmath79 then , inserting in the numerical values , equation ( 25 ) reduces to : @xmath80 or equivalently : @xmath81 where @xmath82km / s / mpc is the hubble constant .",
    "this result can be compared with the emn simulation results : @xmath83 to convert the @xmath84 masses of emn to @xmath85 we have used the observed scaling of the mass with density contrast @xmath86 ( hms ) , which is consistent with the nfw profile ( navarro , frenk , & white 1997 ) for simulated dark matter halos as well as observations ( e.g. , tyson , kochanski , & dellantonio 1998 ) , in the relevant range of radius .",
    "in this section we try to use different analytical methods as well as the results of dark matter simulations and observed gas properties , available in the literature , to constrain the numerical factors which appear in @xmath78 ( equation 26 ) .",
    "so far we have made no particular assumption about the gas dynamics or its history , and so we are going to rely on the available observational results to constrain gas properties .",
    "@xmath87 is defined as the ratio of kinetic energy per unit mass of dark matter to the thermal energy of gas particles .",
    "this ratio is typically of the order of unity , though different observational and theoretical methods lead to different values .",
    "the hydrodynamic simulation results usually point to a larger value of @xmath87 .",
    "for example , thomas ( 2001 ) find @xmath88 . on the other hand , observational data point to a slightly lower value of @xmath87 .",
    "observationally there is yet no direct way of accurately measuring the velocity dispersion of dark matter particles in the cluster and one is required to assume that the velocity distribution of galaxies follows that of dark matter or adopt a velocity bias . under the assumption of no velocity bias girardi 1998",
    "find it to be @xmath89 .",
    "girardi 2000 study @xmath87 for a sample of high redshift clusters and do not find any evidence for redshift dependence . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the actual value of @xmath87 might be substantially different from the observed number , because both the velocity and density of galaxies do not necessarily follow those of the dark matter , which could have resulted in some non - negligible selection effects .",
    "unknown sources of heating such as due to gravitational energy on small scales which is often substantially underestimated in simulations due to limited resolutions or baryonic processes like supernova feedback may affect the value of @xmath87 as well .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations show that only a small fraction of the baryons contribute to galaxy formation in large clusters ( e.g. , blanton 2000 ) and so @xmath56 is close to one .",
    "observationally we quote bryan ( 2000 ) who compiled different observations for the cluster mass fraction in gas and galactic component with @xmath90 albeit with a large scatter in the relation . inserting equation ( 30 ) into equation ( 18 )",
    ", we see that the correction to @xmath91 is less than @xmath92 for all of feasible cosmological models which are dominated by non - baryonic dark matter . in what follows , unless mentioned otherwise , we adopt the value @xmath93 and absorb any correction into the overall normalization of the t - m relation .      in the original top - hat approximation ( gunn & gott 1972 ) which has been extensively used in the literature ,",
    "the initial density distribution is assumed to be constant inside @xmath26 , which leads to @xmath94 .",
    "shapiro , iliev , & raga ( 1999 ) and iliev & shapiro ( 2001 ) have extended the original treatment of top - hat spherical perturbation to a more self - consistent case with a trancated isothermal sphere final density distribution including the surface pressure term ( see  3.4 ) .",
    "here we consider the general case with an arbitrary density profile of a single density peak .",
    "but before going further , let us separate out the term due to space curvature in the definition of @xmath76 . using the definitions of @xmath37 and @xmath74 in equations ( 12 ) and ( 24 ) , and friedmann equations to insert for @xmath21 in terms of the present day cosmological parameters ,",
    "we get : @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the density parameters due to non relativistic matter and cosmological constant , respectively , at the time of observation , @xmath41 and @xmath98 are should not to be confused with the cosmological scale factor . ] the same as @xmath74 and @xmath37 with @xmath99 replaced by @xmath20 in their definitions , equations ( 24 ) and ( 12 ) .    assuming that the initial density profile has a single , spherically symmetric peak and assuming a power law for the initial linear correlation function at the cluster scale",
    ", we can replace @xmath100 by @xmath101 , @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the index of the density power spectrum ( peebles 1981 ) and @xmath104 is the correlation length .",
    "this gives @xmath105,\\ ] ] where all the quantities are evaluated at the age of the observed cluster .",
    "note that for models of interest the physically plausible range for @xmath103 is @xmath106 .",
    "one can see that the second term in equation ( 33 ) is indeed proportional to @xmath107 and so for an open universe it dominates for large time ( after curvature domination ) .",
    "noting that in equation ( 25 ) , the temperature is proportional to @xmath108 , so , when the second term dominates , the t - m relation will no longer evolve with time .",
    "this indicates that in an open universe the cluster formation freezes out after a certain time .",
    "the presence of freeze - out time is independent of the central peak approximation since the ratio @xmath109 only depends on the statistics of the initial fluctuations at high redshifts where there is very little dependence on cosmology .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the case @xmath110 , the ratio has no dependence on cosmology and there is no freeze - out even in low density universes .",
    "this is an interesting case where linear theory does not apply , because all scales become nonlinear at the same time and _ the universe is inhomogeneous on all scales_. voit ( 2000 ) uses a different method to obtain exactly the same result .",
    "as we argue next , both treatments ignore cluster mergers .",
    "the single peak approximation discussed in  3.2 ignores the presence of other peaks in the initial density distribution . in hierarchical structure formation models",
    ", the mass of a cluster grows with time through mergers as well as accretion .",
    "this means that multiple peaks may be present within @xmath26 and suppress the effect of the central peak .    assuming gaussian statistics for initial density fluctuations",

    "note that using equation ( 24 ) , we can fix the value @xmath74 ( and hence @xmath41 ) for a given mass and virialization time .",
    "so the problem reduces to finding the statistics of @xmath98 ( or @xmath37 ) for fixed @xmath41 . under the assumption of a power law spectrum ( see appendix a ) calculations give @xmath111 with @xmath112^{\\frac{1}{2}}(\\frac{r_{0i}}{r_i})^{\\frac{n+3}{2}},\\ ] ] which , inserting into equation ( 31 ) , yields @xmath113 , \\\\      \\frac{\\delta b}{a } & = & \\tau(n)(\\frac{m}{m_{0l}})^{-\\frac{n+3}{6 } } d^{-1}(t ) ( \\frac{\\sqrt{\\omega_m } ht}{\\pi})^{\\frac{2}{3 } } ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath114 is the growth factor of linear perturbations , normalized to @xmath115 for large redshift , and @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the linearly evolved correlation function at the present time with @xmath118 being the correlation length , and @xmath119^{\\frac{1}{2}}.\\ ] ]    fig 2 shows the dependence of @xmath76 on @xmath103 .",
    "the upper dotted curve shows the result of the single peak approximation ( equation 33 ) , while three lower curves show the multiple peak calculation described above ( equation 36 ) and its @xmath120 dispersion ( equation 37 ) .",
    "all the curves are for an einstein - de sitter universe and the dispersion is calculated for mass @xmath121 .",
    "numerically , for @xmath122mpc we have @xmath123 , resulting in @xmath124 for @xmath125 .",
    "we note that @xmath126 the density distribution is dominated by the central peak and corresponds to the top - hat case , and so two methods give similar results .",
    "interestingly , as @xmath103 approaches zero , small peaks dominate and the distribution becomes close to homogeneous ( top hat ) on large scales .",
    "this implies that clusters undergo a large number of mergers for large values of @xmath103 .",
    "interestingly , in this case the ratio @xmath76 again approaches @xmath127 , the value for the top - hat case .",
    "we will use the multiple - peak approximation in our subsequent calculations .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the ratio of the cosmology dependent term in the average value of @xmath128 to the constant term , in the multiple - peak calculation , is small .",
    "for example , for @xmath129 and @xmath130 , this ratio is about @xmath131 .",
    "this implies that the freeze - out time is large comparing to the current age of the universe for feasible open cosmological models and consequently @xmath128 largely is determined by the spectral index of the underlying linear power spectrum @xmath103 .",
    "as discussed in  2 , corrections to the virial relation due to finite surface pressure changes the m - t relation ( equation 25 ) .",
    "shapiro , iliev , & raga ( 1999 ) and iliev & shapiro ( 2001 ) have previously also taken into account the surface pressure term in their treatment of the trancated isothermal sphere equilibrium structure with a top - hat initial density perturbation and have found results in good agreement with simulations .",

    "since @xmath181 is only a translation of the sphere and does not change its geometry , the lowest non - vanishing multipoles are for @xmath182 , and the only rotation invariant expression is @xmath183 where we absorbed any constant factor in the definition of @xmath184 s .",
    "the next simplifying assumption is that @xmath184 s are gaussian variables , with amplitudes proportional to the amplitude of the density fluctuations at the cluster mass scale .",

    "the physical motivation is that since the density fluctuations decrease with scale , more massive clusters tend to deviate less from sphericity . choosing gaussian statistics for @xmath184 s is only a simplifying assumption to carry out the calculations .",

    "we only consider the nfw profile , since it is extensively considered in the literature .",
    "we find that the behavior of @xmath152 can be fitted by : @xmath194 where @xmath195 the error in this fitting formula is less than @xmath196 in the range @xmath197 .",
    "inserting this into equation ( 63 ) leads to the pdf of @xmath152 : @xmath198\\cosh[\\frac{y_0-\\bar{y}}{\\delta y^2 } \\sqrt{\\frac{q^2-q^2_0}{n}}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    fig 9 shows three different examples of the pdf obtained here .",
    "it is clear that the scatter in @xmath152 is asymmetric .",
    "in fact , since the average value of @xmath153 is close to the minimum of equation ( 57 ) , the scatter in @xmath153 shifts the average value of @xmath152 upwards systematically . in the limit of large @xmath193 , where this shift is significant",
    ", @xmath199 is approximately : @xmath200\\ , \\theta(q - q_0),\\ ] ] where @xmath201 is the heaviside step function .",
    "although the assumption of gaussianity is not strictly valid for @xmath175 which includes non - spherical corrections , we still can , as an approximation , use the above expressions for the pdf by replacing @xmath192 and @xmath202 by @xmath203 and @xmath204 .",
    "it is also easy to find the average of @xmath205 @xmath206.\\ ] ] as an example , for @xmath207 , while @xmath208 gives only about @xmath209 systematic increase in @xmath152 , @xmath210 leads to@xmath211 increase .",
    "the temperature found in  2.4 is the density weighted temperature of the cluster averaged over the entire cluster .",
    "however , the observed temperature , @xmath212 , can be considered as a flux - weighted spectral temperature averaged over a smaller , central region of the cluster .",
    "the two temperatures may be different , due to presence of inhomogeneities in temperature .",
    "we use the simulation results by mathiesen & evrard ( 2001 ) to relate these two temperatures and refer the reader to their paper for their exact definitions and the discussion of the effects which lead to this difference : @xmath213.\\ ] ] this correction changes the mass - temperature relation from @xmath214 to @xmath215 for the observed x - ray temperatures .",
    "we use this correction in converting the observed x - ray temperature to virial temperature in figures 1 and 10 - 12 .",
    "it is clear from equation ( 49 ) that we arrive at the usual @xmath216 relation that is expected from simple scaling arguments and is consistent with the numerical simulations ( e.g. emn or bryan & norman 1998 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the observational @xmath217-model mass estimates lead to a steeper power index in the range @xmath218 .",
    "although originally interpreted as an artifact of the @xmath217-model ( hms ) , the same behavior was seen for masses estimated from resolved temperature profile ( frb ) .",
    "frb carefully analyzed the data and interpret this behavior as a bent in the m - t at low temperatures .",
    "this was confirmed by xu , jin & wu ( 2001 ) who found the break at @xmath219 .    as discussed in  3.7 ,",
    "the asymmetric scatter in @xmath152 introduces a systematic shift in the m - t relation . for large values of @xmath193 all of the temperatures are larger than the value given by the scaling relation ( 54 ) for average value of @xmath153 .",
    "this scatter increases for smaller masses ( see equation 37 ) , hence smaller clusters are hotter than the scaling prediction . as a result ,",
    "the m - t relation becomes steeper in the low mass range as @xmath152 increases , while the intrinsic scatter of the data is also getting larger .",
    "indeed , increased scatter is also observed in the frb data(fig 1 and fig s 10 - 12 to compare with our prediction ) but they interpret it as the effect of different formation redshifts .",
    "we will address this interpretation in  5 .      as we discussed in  3.4 , our normalization ( i.e. , @xmath152 in equation 50 )",
    "is rather stable with respect to variations of cosmology and the equilibrium density profile .",
    "table 1 compares this value with various observational and simulation results .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table 1 .",
    "comparison of normalizations from different methods .",
    "the last two rows only include clusters hotter than 3 kev .",
    "we see that our analytical method is consistent with the hydro - simulation results , indicating validity of our method , since both have a similar physics input and the value of @xmath87 used here was obtained from simulations . on the other hand ,",
    "x - ray mass estimates lead to normalizations about @xmath220 higher than our result and simulations .",
    "the result of the optical mass estimates quoted is marginally consistent with our result . assuming that this is true",
    "would imply that optical masses are systematically higher than x - ray masses by @xmath221 .",
    "aaron ( 1999 ) have compared optical and x - ray masses for a sample of 14 clusters and found , on the contrary , a systematic difference less than @xmath222 .",
    "the optical masses used in the work of aaron ( 1999 ) were all derived by cnoc group ( carlberg et al .",
    "1996 ) while the girardi et al .",
    "1998 data , used in hms analysis quoted above , was compiled from different sources and has larger scatter and unknown systematic errors .",
    "in fact hms excluded a number of outliers to get the correct slope and original data had even larger scatter ( see their fig 1 ) .",
    "therefore it may be that the systematic error in the optical result of table 1 , be much larger and so in agreement with other observations .    as discussed in  3.1",
    ", one possible source for difference between theoretical and observational normalizations is that the values for @xmath87 are different in the two cases due to systematic selection effects . also ,",
    "intriguingly , bryan & norman ( 1998 ) show that there is a systematic increase in the obtained value of @xmath87 by increasing the resolution of the simulations .",
    "whether this is a significant and/or real effect for even higher resolutions is not clear to us .    however , the fact that the slope is unchanged indicates that the missing process is , probably , happening at small scales and so relates the intermediate - scale temperature to the small - scale flux - weighted spectral temperature by a constant factor , independent of the large - scale structure of the cluster . in this case",
    "the actual value of @xmath87 must be @xmath223 .",
    "figures 10 - 12 show the prediction of our model , shifted downwards to fit the observational data in the massive end , versus the observational data of frb using resolved temperature profile and corrected as discussed in  3.8 .",
    "the correction due to initial non - sphericity (  3.6 ) is included in the theoretical plot .",
    "the value of @xmath224 which enters @xmath188 ( equation 37 ) through @xmath225 , is fixed by cluster abundance observations ( e.g. bahcal & fan 1998 ) .",
    "we see that while an einstein - de sitter cosmology under - estimates the scatter in the low mass end , a typical low density ocdm cosmology overestimates it .",
    "on the other hand , a typical @xmath3cdm cosmology is consistent with the observed scatter .",
    "interestingly , this is consistent with various other methods , in particular cmb+sne ia result which point to a low - density flat universe ( de bernardis 2000 ; balbi 2000 ; riess 1998 ) .      as we discussed in  3.4",
    ", the value of our normalization has a weak dependence on cosmology .",
    "going back to equation ( 49 ) , we see that the time dependence of the m - t relation is simply : @xmath226 .",
    "assuming a constant value of @xmath87 , this formula can be potentially used to measure the value of @xmath227 at high redshifts and so constrain the cosmology .    schindler ( 1999 )",
    "has compiled a sample of 11 high redshift clusters ( @xmath228 ) from the literature with measured isothermal @xmath217-model masses . in these estimates , the gas is assumed to be isothermal and have the density profile : @xmath229 then , the mass in overdensity @xmath165 is given by : @xmath230    comparing this with equation ( 49 ) , and neglecting the difference between virial and x - ray temperatures , we get : @xmath231 in the last two equations , we have ignored @xmath232 with respect to the radius of the virialized region , which introduces less than @xmath233 error .",
    "this allows us to find the normalization @xmath152 from the value of @xmath234 ( independent of cosmology in this case ) .",
    "assuming @xmath93 , equation ( 71 ) gives the value of @xmath152 for a given @xmath234 .",
    "fig 13 shows the value of @xmath152 versus redshift for schindler ( 1999 ) sample and also frb resolved temperature method for low redshift clusters .",
    "this result is consistent with no redshift dependence and the best fit is : @xmath235    the combination of this result and equation ( 50 ) gives @xmath236    which relates x - ray temperature of galaxy clusters to their masses that does not depend on the theoretical uncertainties with regard to the normalization coefficient of the m - t relation , in this range of redshifts .",
    "the systematic error in this result is less than @xmath92 while the random scatter can be as large as @xmath4 .",
    "this result is valid for @xmath237 since below this temperature the systematic shift due to random scatter becomes significant (  3.7 ) .",
    "it is easy to see that this threshold moves to lower temperatures in high redshifts in our formalism .",
    "note that the more realistic interpretation of a possible evolution in observed @xmath152 , obtained above , is that in equation ( 71 ) , @xmath152 remains constant ( fig 5 ) and , instead , @xmath60 varies with time .",
    "however there will be virtually no difference with respect to the m - t relation and , moreover , the weak redshift dependence in equation ( 73 ) shows that @xmath60 is indeed almost constant .",
    "in this section we discuss the validity of different approximations which were adopted throughout this paper .    in the calculation of initial and final energy of the cluster , we ignored any contribution from the vacuum energy .",
    "in fact we know that cosmological constant in the newtonian limit can be considered as ordinary matter with a constant density .",
    "if the cosmological constant does not change with time , then its effect can be considered as a conservative force and so energy is conserved . however , in both initial state and final equilibrium state of the cluster the density of cosmological constant is much smaller than the density of matter and hence its contribution is negligible .",
    "this does not hold for quintessential models of the vacuum energy since @xmath3 changes with time and energy is not conserved .",
    "this may be used as a potential method to distinguish these models from a simple cosmological constant .",
    "let us make a simple estimate of the importance of this effect .",
    "we expect the relative contribution of a varying cosmological constant be maximum when the density of the proto - cluster is minimum .",
    "this happens at the turn - over radius which is almost twice @xmath238 , the virial radius , in the top - hat approximation .",
    "then the contribution to the energy due to the vacuum energy would be : @xmath239 this gives about @xmath240 correction to @xmath153 or about @xmath241 correction to @xmath135 .",
    "we see that still the effect is small but , in principle observable if we have a large sample of clusters with measured concentration parameters .",
    "a systematic error in our results might have been introduced by replacing the density distribution by an averaged radial profile which under - estimates the magnitude of gravitational energy and so the temperature . also , as shown by thomas et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , most of the clusters in simulations are either steeper or shallower than the nfw profile at large radii . since our normalization is consistent with simulation results , we think that these effects do not significantly alter our predictions .",
    "let us now compare our results with that of voit ( 2000 ) , who made the first such analytic calculation ( but we were not aware of his elegant work until the current work was near completion ) which is not based on the top - hat initial density perturbation and uses the same ingredients to obtain m - t relation .",
    "first of all , as noted in  3.3 , his result , which is equivalent to the central peak approximation to find @xmath76 , ignores the possibility of mergers .",
    "as we see in fig ( 2 ) the value of @xmath76 and so @xmath153 is about @xmath220 larger in the single peak case than the multiple peak case .",
    "although it does not change the normalization very much , it overestimates the concentration parameter ( fig ( 5 ) ) in our formalism .",
    "however , as pointed out by the referee , our formaism for finding the value of @xmath135 is based on the assumption of isotropic velocity dispersion ( equation ( 45 ) ) and hence may not be directly compared to voit ( 2000 ) who does not make such assumption .",
    "also voit ( 2000 ) has neglected the cosmology dependence of the surface correction , @xmath242 , which gives a false cosmology dependence to the normalization .",
    "this is inconsistent with hydro - simulations ( e.g. emn , mathiesen 2000 ) and does not give the systematic shift in the lower mass end , if we assume it does not have a non - gravitational origin .",
    "finally , we comment on the interpretation of the scatter / bent in the lower mass end as being merely due to different formation redshifts which is suggested by frb .",
    "although different formation redshifts can certainly produce this scatter / bent , it is not possible to distinguish it from scatter in initial energy of the cluster or its initial non - sphericity , in our formalism .",
    "on the other hand , the frb prescription , which assumes constant temperature after the formation time , is not strictly true because of the on - going accretion of matter even after the cluster is formed .",
    "so , as argued by mathiesen 2000 using simulation results , the formation time might not be an important factor , whereas the effect can be produced by scatter in initial conditions of the proto - cluster .",
    "we combine conservation of energy with the virial theorem to derive the mass - temperature relation of the clusters of galaxies and obtain the following results :    * simple spherical model gives the usual relation @xmath0 , with the normalization factor @xmath1 being in excellent agreement with hydro simulations .",
    "however , both our normalization and that from hydro simulations are about @xmath243 higher than the x - ray mass estimate results .",
    "this is probably due to our poor understanding of the history of the cluster gas . *",
    "non - sphericity introduces an asymmetric , mass - dependent scatter ( the lower the mass , the larger the scatter ) for the @xmath244 relation thus alters the slope at the low mass end ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "we can reproduce the recently observed scatter / bent in the m - t relation in the lower mass end for a low density @xmath3cdm cosmology , while einstein- de sitter / ocdm cosmologies under / overestimate this scatter / bent .",
    "we conclude that the behavior at the low mass end of the m - t digram can be used to constrain cosmological models . *",
    "we point out that the concentration parameter of the cluster and its scatter can be determined by our formalism .",
    "the concentration parameter determined using this method is marginally consistent with simulation results , which provides a way to find non - spherical corrections to m - t relation by fitting our concentration parameter to the simulation results . *",
    "our normalization has a very weak dependence on cosmology and formation history .",
    "this is consistent with simulation results .",
    "* we find mass - temperature relation ( 73 ) , for clusters of galaxies , based on the observations calibrated by our formalism , which can be used to find masses of galaxy clusters from their x - ray temperature in the range of redshift @xmath245 with the accuracy of @xmath4 .",
    "this is a powerful tool to find the evolution of mass function of clusters , using their temperature function .",
