    "in the past two decades , there has been lots of interest in distributed cooperative control for multi - agent systems due to its potential applications in formation flying , sensor networks , path planning and so forth . as a fundamental issue arising from distributed cooperative control for multi - agent systems ,",
    "consensus has received compelling attention from various scientific communities @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , ranging from mathematics to engineering , due to its less communication cost , greater efficiency , higher robustness , and so on .    in recent years , distributed average tracking , as a generalization of consensus and cooperative tracking problem , has received increasing attention and been applied in many different perspectives , such as distributed sensor networks @xcite , @xcite and distributed coordination @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the objective of distributed average tracking problem is to design a distributed algorithm for multi - agent systems to track the average of the multiple reference signals .",
    "the motivation of this problem comes from coordinated tracking for multiple camera systems .",
    "motivated by the pioneering works in @xcite , and @xcite on distributed average tracking via linear algorithms , the applications of the related results on distributed sensor fusion @xcite , @xcite , and formation control @xcite were proceeded from the reality . in @xcite ,",
    "distributed average tracking was investigated by considering the robustness to the initial errors in algorithms .",
    "the above - mentioned results are very interesting and important for scientific researchers to build up a general framework to investigate this topic . however , a common assumption in the above works is that the dynamics of the multiple reference signals are linear such as constant reference signals @xcite or reference signals with steady states @xcite . in practical applications ,",
    "the reference signals may be produced by more general dynamics .",
    "motivated by this observation , a class of nonlinear algorithms was designed in @xcite to track multiple reference signals with a bounded deviation .",
    "then , based on the non - smooth control approaches , a couple of distributed algorithms were proposed in @xcite and @xcite for agents to track arbitrary time - varying reference signals with bounded derivatives and bounded accelerations , respectively .",
    "further results in @xcite studied the distributed average tracking problems for multiple bounded signals with linear dynamics .    motivated by the above mentioned observations , this technical note is devoted to solving the distributed average tracking problem with continuous algorithms , for multiple time - varying signals with general linear dynamics , whose reference inputs are assumed to be nonzero and not available to any agent in the network .",
    "first of all , based on the relative states of the neighboring agents , a class of distributed continuous control algorithms is proposed and analyzed . then , in light of adaptive control technique , a novel class of distributed algorithms with adaptive coupling strengths is designed .",
    "different from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , where the nonlinear signum function was applied to the whole neighborhood ( node - based algorithm ) , while the proposed algorithms in this technical note are designed along the edge - based framework as in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "compared with the existing results , the contributions of this technical note are at least three - fold .",
    "first , two smooth control algorithms are proposed in this technical note , which are continuous approximations via the boundary layer concept and play a vital role to reduce chattering phenomenon in real applications .",
    "second , the continuous distributed algorithms proposed in this technical note successfully solve the distributed average tracking problems for more general linear dynamics without the assumption of bounded signals as required in @xcite .",
