    "-5 mm    the most basic equations for shock wave theory are the systems of hyperbolic conservation laws @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the space variables and @xmath2 is the basic dependence variables . such a system represents basic physical model for which @xmath3 is the density of conserved physical quantities and the flux @xmath4 is assumed to be a function of @xmath5 .",
    "more complete system of partial differential equations takes the form @xmath6 with @xmath7 the viscosity matrix and @xmath8 the viscosity parameters , and @xmath9 the sources .",
    "other evolutionary equations which carry shock waves include the interacting particles system , boltzmann equation , and discrete systems .",
    "discrete systems can appear as difference approximations to hyperbolic conservation laws . in all these systems ,",
    "shock waves yield rich phenomena and also present serious mathematical difficulties due to their strong nonlinear character .",
    "-5 mm    much has been done for hyperbolic conservation laws in one space dimension @xmath10 see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the article by bressan in this volume . because the solutions in general contain discontinuous shock waves , the system provides impetus for the introduction of new ideas , such as the glimm functional , and is a good testing ground for new techniques , such as the theory of compensated compactness , in nonlinear analysis .",
    "-5 mm    physical models of the form of viscous conservation laws are not uniformly parabolic , but hyperbolic - parabolic .",
    "basic study of the dissipation of solutions for such a system has been done using the energy method , see @xcite .",
    "study of nonlinear waves for these systems has been initiated , @xcite , @xcite , however , much more remains to be done .",
    "the difficulty lies in the nonlinear couplings due to both the nonlinearity of the flux @xmath4 , which is the topic of consideration for hyperbolic conservation laws , as well as that of the viscosity matrix @xmath7 .",
    "for instance , the study of zero dissipation limit @xmath11 , see bressan s article , has been done only for the artificial viscosity matrix @xmath12 .",
    "-5 mm    sources added to conservation laws may represents geometric effects , chemical reactions , or relaxation effects .",
    "thus there should be no unified theory for it .",
    "when the source represents the geometric effects , such the multi - dimensional spherical waves , hyperbolic conservation laws takes the form @xmath13 there has stablizing and destablizing effects , such as in the nozzle flows , @xcite .",
    "the chemical effects occur in the combustions .",
    "there is complicated , still mostly not understood , phenomena on the rich behaviour of combustions .",
    "one interesting problem is the transition from the detonations to deflagrations , where the combined effects of dissipation , compression and chemical energy gives rise to new wave behaviour .",
    "viscous effects are important on the qualitative behaviour of nonlinear waves when the hyperbolic system is not strictly hyperbolic , see @xcite .",
    "relaxation , such as for the kinetic models and thermal non - equilibrium in general , is interesting because of the rich coupling of dissipation , dispersion and hyperbolicity , @xcite .",
    "-5 mm    conservative finite differences to the hyperbolic conservation laws , in one space dimension , take the form : @xmath14(x+\\frac{\\delta x}{2})-f[u^n](x-\\frac{\\delta x}{2})).\\ ] ] it has been shown for a class of two conservation laws and dissipative schemes , such as lax - friedrichs and godunov scheme that the numerical solutions converge to the exact solutions of the conservation laws , @xcite . on the other hand , qualitative studies on the nonlinear waves for difference schemes indicate rich behaviour . in particular , the shock waves depend sensitively on the its c - f - l speeds , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "-5 mm    shock wave theory originated from the study of the euler equations in gas dynamics .",
    "the classical book @xcite is still important and mostly updated on multi - dimensional gas flows .",
    "because of its great difficulty , the study of multi - dimensional shocks concentrate on flows with certain self - similarity property .",
    "one such problem is the riemann problem , with initial value consisting of finite many constant states . in that case , the solutions are function of @xmath15 , not general function of @xmath16 , see @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for other self - similar solutions .",
    "however , unlike single space case , multi - dimensional riemann solutions do not represent general scattering data , and are quite difficult to study .",
    "it is more feasible to consider flows with shocks and solid boundary , e.g. @xcite @xcite .",
    "-5 mm    the boltzmann equation @xmath17 contains much more information than the gas dynamics equations .",
    "nevertheless , the shock waves for all these equations have the same rankine - hugoniot relation at the far states .",
    "the difference is on the transition layer .",
    "there is beginning an effort to make use of the techniques for the conservation laws to study the boltzmann shocks , @xcite .",
    "this is a line of research quite different from the intensive current efforts on the incompressible limits of the boltzmann equation .",
    "-5 mm    interacting particle systems is even closer to the first physical principles than the boltzmann equation .",
    "there is the long - standing problem , the zermelo paradox , in passing from the reversible particle systems to the irreversible systems such as the boltzmann equation , and the euler equations with shocks .",
    "this is fine for particle system with random noises .",
    "however , except for scalar models , so far the derivation of euler equations from the particle systems has been done only for solutions with no shocks , @xcite ."
