    "one of the goals of numerical relativity that has proven to be elusive ( using a 3 + 1 splitting of the einstein equations ) has been that of modeling a generic single black hole long periods of time .",
    "present single black hole simulations in 3d have not yet been shown to be generically stable .",
    "there are limited instances of stability based on the outer boundary choice and placement@xcite .",
    "most simulations run just beyond a few hundreds @xmath0 based on outer boundary placement and binary black hole simulations run for about @xmath1 before the codes either crash or the entire grid is inside the event horizon . in some cases ,",
    "the reason of the crash is well understood .",
    "for instance , the use of singularity avoiding slices lead to the presence of steep gradients which eventually can no longer be handled by the codes .",
    "a solution to this problem is to `` excise ''",
    "the singularity from the computational domain@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in most cases , it is not clear what the main reasons behind the crash are and consequently addressing the problem becomes cumbersome . in attempting to deal with this issue",
    "there are several possible avenues to either remove or provide an understanding of the source of problems .",
    "these avenues can be divided in the following way :    1 .",
    "choice of formulation of einstein equations ; 2 .",
    "choice of gauge ; 3 .",
    "numerical implementations .    avenue ( 1 ) is motivated by the difficulties encountered in achieving long term evolutions with the adm formulation , which historically has been the main tool in numerical relativity .",
    "several formulations exist in the literature that exhibit properties like hyperbolicity@xcite , the equations are expressed in a flux conservative form@xcite and/or try to separate transverse modes@xcite .",
    "avenue ( 2 ) is based on the fact that , in principle , a coordinate system could be chosen such that the fields vary slowly in time ; hence , the simulations would be better behaved . conditions to achieve such coordinates have been presented in the literature@xcite .",
    "lastly , avenue ( 3 ) highlights the need for a more profound understanding of the numerical implementation of the evolution equations .",
    "algorithms specifically tailored to deal with the equations under study could pave the way to better behaved simulations ( for instance , compare with the implementations that deal with the fluid equations and their ` historical evolution ' from crude implementations in early simulations to high resolution shock capturing schemes in present state of the art codes ) .",
    "our present work focuses primarily on avenue ( 1 ) ; although avenues ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) also play a role since notable improvements are achieved with specific gauge choices and the use of causal differencing algorithms .",
    "we compare results obtained from the use of black hole excision with two related forms of the standard adm 3 + 1 equations ; focusing on the use of the cadm system with excision techniques in spherical symmetry .    the main motivation behind the comparison with the conformal adm is the report by many groups that robust implementations have been achieved in linearized gravity , gravitational wave spacetimes , systems containing matter , etc@xcite .",
    "however , so far , it has only been used to model black hole spacetimes using singularity avoiding slices@xcite .",
    "as it is widely accepted , these types of slicings are useful when the desired simulation time is rather short . in order to model black hole spacetimes for long periods of time , singularity excision must be employed . to study the feasibility of excision in this formulation and to analyze its advantages and disadvantages with respect to the traditional adm formulation ( where excision techniques have been used for several years already@xcite ) , we present a @xmath2 study and compare results obtained with both approaches .",
    "we start with a brief review of the formulations in section ii . in section iii , we rewrite the system of equations in a way convenient for causal differencing and describe how this techniques is implemented . in section",
    "iv we compare simulations of a schwarzschild black hole and show how the adm formulation yields longer term evolution _ unless _ the trace of the extrinsic curvature is frozen in time , in which case cadm yields better behaved evolutions than the adm formulation , we also show how causal differencing indeed gives the expected results in terms of stability .",
    "we conclude in section v with a brief discussion .",
    "the standard adm equations , in the form most commonly used in numerical relativity , are@xcite :    [ alleqs ] @xmath3    with @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the lie derivative along the shift vector @xmath6 ; @xmath7 is the ricci tensor and @xmath8 the covariant derivative associated with the three - dimensional metric @xmath9 .",
    "the conformal adm equations  @xcite are obtained from the adm ones by ( i ) making use of a conformal decomposition of the three - metric as @xmath10 ( hence @xmath11 ) ; ( ii ) decomposing the extrinsic curvature into its trace and trace - free components .",

    "note that the two systems of equations have in this form the same basic structure ; hence , simple modifications to an adm code with excision ( like agave@xcite ) will enable the use of already developed excision modules with the cadm equations in a straightforward manner .      in the numerical implementation of the cadm it is convenient to introduce an intermediate variable @xmath39 such that @xmath40 and evolve @xmath39 instead of @xmath20 .",

    "as has been observed in previous work@xcite , cadm gives long term evolutions when the evolution of @xmath32 is  frozen \" ; ie the equation for @xmath32 is not evolved or the value of @xmath32 is fixed by the choice of a slicing that leaves @xmath32 fixed ( for instance , maximal slicing that fixes @xmath50 . ) . on the other hand ,",
    "longer term evolutions have also been achieved with an area locking gauge in the adm formulation@xcite .",

    "outer boundary data are provided by ` blending'@xcite the numerical solution to the analytical one .",
    "this choice reduces gradients and second derivatives at the boundary allowing for a clean evolution without much reflections from the outer boundary .      in this case , all equations corresponding to systems ( [ all_adm],[all_cadm ] ) are evolved and the obtained solutions are compared .",
    "we use the hamiltonian and momentum constraint as monitors of the quality of the evolution .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows . for the adm formulation we observed that stable evolutions are obtained if @xmath54 while for larger @xmath55 the solution exhibits exponentially growing modes .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the evolution is not unstable under the strict sense ( i.e. the solution can be bounded from above by an exponential@xcite . ) .",
    "however , the presence of this exponential mode will likely spoil any long term simulation . for the cadm system , irrespective of the value of @xmath56 exponential modes are clearly present in the solutions .",
    "these results are illustrated in fig.[fig_testa ] , which shows the @xmath57 norm of the hamiltonian and momentum constraints of the solutions obtained with both formulations when @xmath58 . clearly , the solution obtained with the adm is better than that obtained with the cadm .",
    "figure [ fig_testa ] , also displays the @xmath57 norm of the hamiltonian constraint for the case @xmath59 , although the solution obtained with the adm formulation can be considered better than that from the cadm , both grow exponentially .",
    "it has been observed in the literature@xcite that in the case where @xmath32 is fixed in time very long term evolutions can be obtained with the cadm system .",
    "it is interesting to see what this condition implies , note that if @xmath32 does not vary , then , @xmath20 will remain unchanged and therefore the determinant of the three metric @xmath9 will remain independent of time .",
    "this , could be regarded as an evolution that  locks \" the volume and bears some similarity with the so - called  area - locking \" gauge@xcite .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that a similar strategy can be implemented in the adm case as it has been shown in@xcite . in this work , by choosing a gauge that  locks \" the evolution of @xmath60 the exponentially growing modes displayed by solutions in domains with @xmath61 are removed .",
    "figure [ fig_testb ] shows the @xmath57 norm of the hamiltonian and momentum constraints corresponding to solutions obtained with both formulations for the choice @xmath58 and @xmath59 . in both cases",
    "the simulations can be performed for unlimited time without observing exponential modes .",
    "again , the solution obtained with the adm formulation is slightly more accurate than that provided by the cadm formulation .",
    "it is important to observe that for the cadm case with @xmath32 frozen , evolutions without exponentially growing modes are obtained with @xmath56 as large as @xmath62 . for @xmath63 long term evolutions ( @xmath64 ) display at late times a clear exponentially growing mode .      in this case , we test the evolutions under perturbations ( using a locked evolution in the cadm case but not in the adm one ) .",
    "the initial data corresponds to the analytic value of @xmath65 ( or @xmath66 ) plus some arbitrary pulse of compact support .",
    "of course , this data is unphysical but we use it to probe for stability of the implementations in a non - trivial scenario .",
    "the amplitude of the pulse is chosen such that it can be considered a linear perturbation of a schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "the results obtained with both codes agree with those of the previous section .",
    "figure [ pulse ] corresponds to the evolution of a pulse with compact support in @xmath67 $ ] being evolved in a computational domain of @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "the @xmath57 norm of the hamiltonian constraint , after some initial transient behavior , settles into a stationary regime .      as mentioned , in previous work@xcite , by not evolving the equation for @xmath32 very long term evolutions",
    "have been achieved with the cadm formulation .",
    "however , choosing to do so is unphysical in generic situations .",
    "one would like to have a prescription where a similar condition can be enforced without having to not evolve one or more equations .",
    "here , one can use the gauge freedom of the theory to demand that @xmath69 .",
    "this in turns implies a condition of the shift vector from equation ( [ all_cadmc ] ) , @xmath70 \\ , \\label{lockk}.\\ ] ] this condition is straightforward to implement in 1d but is certainly more complicated in 3d .",
    "additionally , there is a great deal of ambiguity as it is only one equation for three variables @xmath6 .",
    "therefore two supplementary conditions must be chosen so that ( [ lockk ] ) can be used to ` freeze ' the evolution of @xmath32 . in our present implementaion",
    "we have simply chosen @xmath71 ( with @xmath72 ) and obtain @xmath73 with ( [ lockk ] ) as @xmath74 \\right ) \\ , \\label{lockk_2}.\\ ] ] a simple way to obtain @xmath73 is by a first order approximation of the rhs of eq .",
    "[ lockk_2 ] ( ie . evaluating each term at the old level ) . by using this condition , instead of choosing not to evolve @xmath32",
    ", we were able to obtain evolutions not displaying exponential modes for times larger than @xmath75 ( with resolutions of @xmath76 and finer ) .",
    "figure [ lockshift ] illustrates what is obtained in a simulation with computational domain defined by @xmath77 $ ] ( with @xmath76 ) .",
    "the values of the @xmath57 norms of the hamiltonian , the function @xmath78 and value of @xmath79 are shown as a function of time . since",
    "@xmath73 is obtained only as a first order approximation , @xmath32 and @xmath39 are expected to vary during the evolution . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ lockshift ] , both grow linearly but stay fairly close to zero and the evolution proceeds without displaying an exponential growth .      as a last point",
    ", it is interesting to see how causal differencing is indeed providing a correct way to discretize the equations taking advantage of the causal properties of the spacetime .",
    "the fact that the null cones ( or the causal domain of dependence ) are tilted inside the horizon , allows for a stable numerical implementation where inner boundary data need not be provided if the inner boundary is inside the black hole ( see fig .",
    "[ pablo ] ) .",
    "this is possible because the numerical domain of dependence naturally contains the domain of dependence of the inner boundary point .",
    "this is of course , not true if the innermost point is outside the event horizon . in order to illustrate this fact we compare @xmath80 cases ( with both formulations ) where the innermost point is placed inside or just outside the event horizon . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ pabloplace ] , while the solution obtained with the inner boundary inside the black hole is stable , the other , as expected is unstable .",
    "the results presented in this work show that excision techniques can be straightforwardly used in the cadm formulation directly from the structures developed for the adm formulation .",
    "the adm formulation is superior to the cadm both in accuracy and total time evolution when the evolution of @xmath32 is not locked in cadm .",
    "when locking is implemented , then cadm is better than adm as the solution obtained with the cadm formulation does not display exponential modes with the outer boundary placed as far as @xmath81 . on the other hand , evolutions with the adm formulation display exponential modes with the outer boundary placed at @xmath82 and beyond",
    "additionally , for the case where outer boundaries are placed ` very ' far , although exponentially growing solutions are present in solutions obtained with both formulations , adm simulations crash at earlier times than cadm .",
    "it is worth remarking again that in both formulations , implementing a gauge that minimizes the changes in some of the fields ( like @xmath60 in the adm formulation or @xmath32 in the cadm one ) dramatically improves the evolutions in 1d . in the 3d case , the use of ` area or circunference locking ' ( circunference locking ) . ] is indeed more complicated than locking @xmath32 , simply by the fact that in the former case one is trying to control a tensor component while in the latter a scalar .",
    "thus , locking @xmath32 is likely to have an easier and probably more general implementation than area locking ( although in cases where the final black hole is close to a non spinning one , this implementation is rather straightforward ) .",
    "controling the evolution of @xmath32 demans a condition like that given by eq ( [ lockk ] ) , and two extra conditions on @xmath6 will be required .",
    "an option that could mimic the 1d implementation would be to foliate the 3d hypersurfaces with a sequence of 2-surfaces defined by @xmath83 ( with @xmath84 the expansion of outgoing null rays ) .",
    "once this foliation is obtained , the shift vector @xmath6 could be decomposed as @xmath85 with @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) parallel ( perpendicular ) to the normal of the 2-surfaces .",
    "thus , the two further conditions can be chosen such that @xmath88 .",
    "this will thus minimize changes in transversal directions and will resemble that we have used in the 1d case . of course",
    ", this is just one possible approach and further studies will be required to obtain a @xmath32 fixing condition that leads to a practical implementation .    in conclusion ,",
    "implementing singularity excision techniques in the cadm formulation is straightforward .",
    "the usefulness of this implementation depends on implementing a gauge controlling the behavior of @xmath32 . assuming this can be achieved",
    ", cadm appears to be capable of providing more robust simulations than adm when the outer boundary is placed farther than @xmath82 from the final black hole of mass @xmath0 , if the outer boundary is closer , then the adm formulation provides evolutions as stable as the cadm one but with better accuracy .    as a last remark , it is important to stress that we have only implemented the causal differencing algorithm described in@xcite since at present is the only one fully implemented in @xmath89 .",
    "other alternatives have been proposed@xcite ; due to the restriction to spherical symmetry it is likely that the application of these will yield similar results to those presented in this work .",
