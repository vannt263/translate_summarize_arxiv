    "the lectures collected in the present paper have been written on the on the occasion of a course prepared for the phd program of the university of milan - bicocca . following the kind invitation of g. marchesini and c. destri",
    "i have been very glad of presenting a logical collection of topics selected among the physics of cosmic microwave background ( cmb in what follows ) . while preparing these lectures i have been faced with the problems usually encountered in trying to introduce the conceptual foundations of a rapidly growing field . to this difficulty one must add , as usual ,",
    "that the cultural background of phd students is often diverse : not all phd students are supposed to take undergraduate courses in field theory , general relativity or cosmology .",
    "last year , during the whole summer semester , i used to teach a cosmology course at the technical school of lausanne ( epfl ) . using a portion of the material prepared for that course",
    ", i therefore summarized the essentials needed for a reasonably self - contained presentation of cmb physics . while i hope that this compromise will be appreciated , it is also clear that a phd course , for its own nature , imposes a necessary selection among the possible topics .    in commencing this script",
    "i wish also to express my very special an sincere gratitude to g. cocconi and e. picasso .",
    "i am indebted to g. cocconi for his advices in the preparation of the first section .",
    "i indebted to e. picasso for sharing his deep knowledge of general relativity and gravitational physics and for delightful discussions which have been extremely relevant both for the selection of topics and for the overall spirit of the course .",
    "the encouragement and comments of l. alvarez - gaum have been also greatly appreciated .",
    "while lecturing in milan i had many stimulating questions and comments on my presentations from l. girardello , g. marchesini , p. nason , s. penati and c. oleari .",
    "these interesting comments led to an improvement of the original plan of various lectures .",
    "i also wish to express my gratitude for the discussions with the members of the astrophysics group .",
    "in particular i acknowledge very interesting discussions with g. sironi on the low - frequency measurements of cmb distorsions and on the prospects of polarization experiments .",
    "i also thank s. bonometto and l. colombo for stimulating questions and advices .",
    "last but not least , i really appreciated the lively and pertinent questions of the phd students attending the course .",
    "in particular , it is a pleasure to thank a. amariti , s. alioli , c .- a .",
    "ratti , e. re and s. spinelli .      in the present section , after a general introduction to black body emission , the question reported in the title of this paper will be partially answered .",
    "the whole observable universe will therefore be approached , in the first approximation , as a system emitting electromagnetic radiation .",
    "the topics to be treated in the present section are therefore the following :    * electromagnetic emission of the universe ; * the black - body spectrum and its physical implications ; * a bit of history of the cmb observations ; * the entropy of the cmb and its implications ; * the time evolution of the cmb temperature .",
    "all along these lectures the natural system of units will be adopted . in this system @xmath0 . in order to pass from one system of units to the other",
    "it is useful to recall that    * @xmath1 ; * @xmath2 ; * @xmath3 ; * @xmath4 .    in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] a rather intriguing plot summarizes the electromagnetic emission of our own universe . only the extra - galactic emissions are reported .    ) of the emitted energy density is reported in units of @xmath5 ( see eq .",
    "( [ crit ] ) ) .",
    "the logarithm of energy of the photons is instead reported on the horizontal axis .",
    "the wavelength scale is inserted at the top of the plot .",
    "the cosmic ray spectrum is included for comparison and in the same units used to describe the electromagnetic contribution.,height=340 ]    on the horizontal axis we have the logarithm of the energy of the photons ( expressed in ev ) .",
    "on the vertical axis we reported the logarithm ( to base @xmath6 ) of @xmath7 which is the energy density of the emitted radiation in critical units and per logarithmic interval of photon momentum ( see , for instance , eq .",
    "( [ critsp ] ) ) . for comparison also the associated wavelength of the emitted radiation",
    "is illustrated ( see the top of the figure ) in units of mm .",
    "figure [ f1 ] motivates the choice of studying accurately the properties of cmb .",
    "moreover , it can be also argued that the properties of cmb encode , amusingly enough , not only the successes of the standard cosmological model but also its potential drawbacks .    in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] the maximum of @xmath7 is located for a wavelength of the @xmath8 ( see the scale of wavelengths at the top of fig . [ f1 ] ) corresponding to typical energies of the order we have @xmath9 and that @xmath10 .",
    "so @xmath11 and @xmath12 . ] of @xmath13 .",
    "in the optical and ultraviolet range of wavelengths the energy density drops of almost two orders of magnitude . in the @xmath14-rays",
    "( i.e. @xmath15 ) the energy density of the emitted radiation drops of more than three orders of magnitude in comparison with the maximum .",
    "the @xmath14-ray range corresponds to photon energies @xmath16 . in the @xmath17-rays ( i.e. @xmath18 )",
    "the spectral amplitude is roughly @xmath19 orders of magnitude smaller than in the case of the millimeter maximum .",
    "the range of @xmath17-rays occurs for photon energies @xmath20 .    while the cmb represents @xmath21 of the extragalactic emission , the infra - red and visible part give , respectively , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath14-ray and @xmath17-ray branches contribute , respectively , by @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the cmb is therefore the 93 % of the total extragalactic emission .",
    "the cmb spectrum has been discovered by penzias and wilson @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and predicted , on the basis of the hot big - bang model , by gamow , alpher and herman ( see , for instance,@xcite ) .",
    "wavelengths as large as @xmath26 lead to an emission which is highly anisotropic and will not be treated here as a cosmological probe . in any case , for @xmath27 we are in the domain of the radio - waves whose analysis is of upmost importance for a variety of problems including , for instance , large scale magnetic fields ( both in galaxies and in clusters ) @xcite , pulsar astronomy @xcite and , last but not least , extraction of cmb foregrounds .",
    "in fact it should be mentioned that also our own galaxy is an efficient emitter of electromagnetic radiation .",
    "since our galaxy possess a magnetic field , it emits synchrotron radiation as well as thermal bremsstrahlung . a very daring project that will probably be at the forefront of radio - astronomical investigations during the next 10 years is ska ( square kilometer array ) @xcite .",
    "while the technical features of the instrument can not be thoroughly discussed in the present contribution , it suffices to notice that the collecting area of the instrument , as the name suggest , will be of @xmath28 .",
    "the design of ska will probably allow full sky surveys of faraday rotation and better understanding of galactic emission    in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] the spectrum of the cosmic rays is also reported , for comparison .",
    "this inclusion is somehow arbitrary since the cosmic rays of moderate energy are known to come from within the galaxy .",
    "however , it is useful to plot also this quantity to compare the energy density of the cosmic rays to the energy density of the cmb . the energy density of the cosmic rays is , roughly , of the same order of the energy density of the cmb . for energies smaller than @xmath29 ev",
    "the rate is approximately of one particle per @xmath30 and per second . for energies larger than @xmath29 ev",
    "the rate is approximately of one particle per @xmath30 and per year .",
    "the difference in these two rates corresponds to a slightly different spectral behaviour of the cosmic ray spectrum , the so - called knee .",
    "finally , for energies larger than @xmath31 ev , the rate of the so - called ultra - high - energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) is even smaller and of the order of one particle per @xmath32 and per year .",
    "the sudden drop in the flux corresponds to another small change in the spectral behaviour , the so - called ankle . in the forthcoming years",
    "the spectrum above the ankle will be scrutinized by the auger experiment @xcite .    in the parametrization chosen in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] the cosmic ray spectrum does not decrease as @xmath33 but rather as @xmath34 .",
    "the rationale for this difference stems from the fact that , in the parametrization of fig .",
    "[ f1 ] we plot the energy density of cosmic rays per logarithmic interval of @xmath35 while , in the standard parametrization the plot is in terms of @xmath36 .",
    "it is important to stress that while the cmb represents the 93 % of the extragalactic emission , the diffuse @xmath14-ray and @xmath17-ray backgrounds are also of upmost importance for cosmology .",
    "various experiments have been dedicated to the study of the @xmath14-ray background such as ariel , einstein , ginga , rosat and , last but not least , beppo - sax , an @xmath14-ray satellite named after giuseppe ( beppo ) occhialini . among @xmath17-ray satellites we shall just mention compton , egret and the forthcoming glast .      according to fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , in the mm range the electromagnetic spectrum of the universe is very well fitted by a black - body spectrum : if we would plot the error bars magnified 400 times they would still be hardly distinguishable from the thickness of the curve . starting from the discovery of penzias and wilson @xcite various groups confirmed , independently , the black - body nature of this emission ( see below , in this section , for an oversimplified account of the intriguing history of cmb observations ) . as it is well known the black - body",
    "has the property of depending only upon one single parameter which is the temperature @xmath37 of the photon gas at the thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "such a temperature is given by @xmath38 according to wien s law @xmath39 .",
    "thus , as already remarked the wavelength of the maximum will be @xmath40 . for a photon gas in thermodynamic equilibrium the energy density of the emitted radiation is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the number of intrinsic degrees of freedom ( @xmath43 in the case of photons ) and @xmath44 is the bose - einstein occupation number : @xmath45 since in natural units , @xmath46 , the energy density of the emitted radiation per logarithmic interval of frequency is given by : @xmath47 equation ( [ difffsp ] ) allows also to compute the total ( i.e. integrated ) energy density @xmath48 .",
    "the differential spectrum ( [ difffsp ] ) can then be referred to the integrated energy density expressed , in turn , in units of the critical energy density . from eq .",
    "( [ difffsp ] ) the integrated energy density of photons is simply given by @xmath49 where the ratio @xmath50 has been defined and where the integral in the second equality is given by @xmath51 .    a useful way of measuring energy densities is to refer them to the _ critical energy density _ of the universe ( see section [ sec2 ] for a more detailed discussion of this important quantity ) . according to the present data it seems that the critical energy density indeed coincides with the _ total _ energy density of the universe .",
    "this is just because experimental data seem to favour a spatially flat universe .",
    "the critical energy density today is given by : @xmath52 where @xmath53 ( often assumed to be @xmath54 for the purpose of numerical estimates along these lectures ) measures the indetermination on the present value of the hubble parameter @xmath55 . from the second equality appearing in eq .",
    "( [ crit ] ) , recalling that the proton mass is @xmath56 , it is also possible to deduce @xmath57 showing that , the critical density is , grossly speaking , the equivalent of @xmath58 proton masses per cubic meter .    from eqs .",
    "( [ difffsp ] ) and ( [ crit ] ) we can obtain the energy density of photons per logarithmic interval of energy and in critical units , i.e. @xmath59 recalling that @xmath11 ( and neglecting the subscript ) we have that @xmath60 where @xmath61 the quantities @xmath7 and @xmath62 are physically different : @xmath62 is the ratio between the total ( present ) energy density of cmb photons and the critical energy density and it is independent on the frequency .",
    "it can be explicitly verified that , inserting the numerical value of @xmath37 and @xmath63 ( i.e. eqs .",
    "( [ tgamma ] ) and ( [ crit ] ) ) , the figure of eq .",
    "( [ omegagamma ] ) is swiftly reproduced .    the spectrum of eq .",
    "( [ critsp1 ] ) can be also plotted in terms of the frequency .",
    "recalling that , in natural units , @xmath64 and that @xmath65 the spectrum @xmath66 is reported in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] .",
    "it should be borne in mind that the cmb spectrum could be distorted by several energy - releasing processes .",
    "these distorsions have not been observed so far . in particular we could wander if a sizable chemical potential is allowed .",
    "the presence of a chemical potential will affect the bose - einstein occupation number which will become , in our rescaled notations @xmath67 .",
    "now the experimental data imply that @xmath68 ( 95% c.l . ) .",
    "it is useful to mention , at this point , the energy density of the cmb in different units and to compare it directly with the cosmic ray spectrum as well as with the energy density of the galactic magnetic field .",
    "in particular we will have that @xmath69 from eqs .",
    "( [ cmbex ] ) and ( [ bex ] ) it follows that the cmb energy density is roughly comparable with the magnetic energy density of the galaxy .",
    "furthermore @xmath70 .",
    "the black - body nature of cmb emission is one of the cornerstones of the standard cosmological model whose essential features will be introduced in section [ sec2 ] .",
    "the first measurement of the cmb spectrum goes back to the work of penzias and wilson @xcite .",
    "the penzias and wilson measurement referred to a wavelength of @xmath71 cm ( corresponding to @xmath72 ghz ) .",
    "they estimated a temperature of @xmath73 . since the penzias and wilson measurement the black - body nature of the cmb spectrum has been investigated and confirmed for a wide range of frequencies extending from @xmath74 ghz @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) up to 300 ghz .",
    "the history of the measurements of the cmb temperature is a subject by itself which has been reviewed in the excellent book of b. patridge @xcite . before 1990 the measurements of cmb properties have been conducted always through terrestrial antennas or even by means of balloon borne experiments . in the nineties the cobe satellite @xcite allowed to measure the properties of the cmb spectrum in a wide range of frequencies including the maximum ( see fig .",
    "the cobe satellite had two instruments : firas and dmr .",
    "the dmr was able to probe the angular power spectrum measures the degree of inhomogeneity in the temperature distribution per logarithmic interval of @xmath75 .",
    "consequently , a given multipole @xmath75 can be related to a given spatial structure in the microwave sky : small @xmath75 will correspond to low wavenumbers , high @xmath75 will correspond to larger wave - numbers . ]",
    "up to @xmath76 . as the name says , dmr was a differential instrument measuring temperature differences in the microwave sky .",
    "the angular resolution of a given instrument , i.e. @xmath77 , is related to the maximal multipole probed in the sky according to the approximate relation @xmath78 .",
    "consequently , since the angular resolution of cobe was @xmath79 , the maximal @xmath75 accessible to that experiment was @xmath80 .",
    "since the angular resolution of wmap is @xmath81 , the corresponding maximal harmonic probed by wmap will be @xmath82 .",
    "finally , the planck experiment , to be soon launched will achieve an angular resolution of @xmath83 , implying @xmath84 .",
    "after the cobe mission , various experiments attempted the exploration of smaller angular separation , i. e. larger multipoles .",
    "a definite convincing evidence of the existence and location of the first peak in the @xmath85 spectrum came from the boomerang @xcite , dasi @xcite and maxima @xcite experiments .",
    "both boomerang and maxima were balloon borne ( bolometric ) experiments .",
    "dasi was a ground based interferometer .",
    "the data points of these last three experiments explored multipoles up to @xmath86 , determining the first acoustic oscillation ( in the jargon the first doppler peak ) for @xmath87 .",
    "another important balloon borne experiments was archeops @xcite providing interesting data for the region characterizing the first rise of the @xmath85 spectrum .",
    "some other useful references on earlier cmb experiments can be found in @xcite .    the @xmath85 spectrum , as measured by different recent experiments is reported in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] ( adapted from ref .",
    "@xcite ) . at the moment",
    "the most accurate determinations of cmb observables are derived from the data of wmap ( wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ) .",
    "the first release of wmap data are the subject of refs .",
    "the three - years release of wmap data is discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . the wmap data ( filled circles in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] ) provided , among other important pieces of information the precise determination of the position of the first peak ( i.e. @xmath88 @xcite ) the evidence of the second peak .",
    "the wmap experiment also measured temperature - polarization correlations providing a distinctive signature ( the so - called anticorrelation peak in the temperature - polarization power spectrum for @xmath89 ) of primordial adiabatic fluctuations ( see sections [ sec8 ] and [ sec9 ] and , in particular fig . [ pol ] ) .        to have a more detailed picture of the evolution and relevance of cmb experiments we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite ( for review of the pre-1994 status of the art ) and ref .",
    "@xcite for a review of the pre-2002 situation ) .",
    "the rather broad set of lectures by bond @xcite may also be usefully consulted .    in recent years , thanks to combined observations of cmb anisotropies @xcite , large scale structure @xcite , supernovae of type ia @xcite , big - bang nucleosyntheis @xcite , some kind of paradigm for the evolution of the late time ( or even present ) universe emerged .",
    "it is normally called by practitioners @xmath90cdm model or even , sometimes ,  concordance model \" .",
    "the terminology of @xmath90cdm refers to the fact that , in this model , the dominant ( present ) component of the energy density of the universe is given by a cosmological constant @xmath90 and a fluid of cold dark matter particles interacting only gravitationally with the other ( known ) particle species such as baryons , leptons , photons . according to this paradigm",
    ", our understanding of the universe can be summarized in two sets of cosmological parameters : the first set of parameters refers to the homogeneous background , the second set of parameters to the inhomogeneities .",
    "so , on top of the indetermination on the ( present ) hubble expansion rate , i.e. @xmath53 , there are various other parameters such as :    * the ( present ) dark energy density in critical units so that the final number will be independent of @xmath53 .",
    "] , i.e. @xmath91 ; * the ( present ) cold dark matter ( cdm in what follows ) energy density , i.e. @xmath92 ; * the ( present ) baryon energy density , i.e. @xmath93 ; * the ( present ) photon energy density ( already introduced ) @xmath94 ; * the ( present ) neutrino energy density , i.e. @xmath95 ; * the optical depth at reionization ( denoted by @xmath96 but commonly named @xmath97 which denotes instead , in the present lectures , the conformal time coordinate , see section [ sec2 ] ) ; * the spectral index of the primordial ( adiabatic ) mode for the scalar fluctuations @xmath98 ; * the amplitude of the curvature perturbations @xmath99 ; * the bias parameter ( related to large scale structure ) .    to this",
    "more or less standard set of parameters one can also add other parameters reflecting a finer description of pre - decoupling physics :    * the neutrinos are , strictly speaking , massive and their masses can then constitute an additional set of parameters ; * the dark energy may not be exactly a cosmological constant and , therefore , the barotropic index of dark energy may be introduced as the ratio between the pressure of dark energy and its energy density ( similar argument can entail also the introduction of the sound speed off dark energy ) ; * the spectral index may not be constant as a function of the wave - number and this consideration implies a further parameter ; * in the commonly considered inflationary scenarios there are not only scalar ( adiabatic ) modes but also tensor modes and this evidence suggests the addition of the relative amplitude and spectral index of tensor perturbations , i.e. , respectively , @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "different parameters can be introduced in order to account for even more daring departures from the standard cosmological lore .",
    "these parameters include    * the amplitude and spectral index of primordial non - adiabatic perturbations ; * the amplitude and spectral index of the correlation between adiabatic and non - adiabatic modes ; * a primordial magnetic field which is fully inhomogeneous and characterized , again , by a given spectrum and an amplitude .",
    "this list can be easily completed by other possible ( and physically reasonable ) parameters .",
    "we just want to remark that the non - adiabatic modes represent a whole set of physical parameters since , as it will be swiftly discussed , there are @xmath102 non - adiabatic modes .",
    "consequently , already a thorough parametrization of the non - adiabatic sector will entail , in its most general incarnation , 4 spectral indices , 4 spectral amplitudes and the mutual correlations of each non - adiabatic mode with the adiabatic one .",
    "having said this it is important to stress that the lectures will not deal with the problem of data analysis ( or parameter extraction from the cmb data ) .",
    "the purpose of the present lectures , as underlined before in this introduction , will be to use cmb as a guiding theme for the formulation of a consistent cosmological framework which might be in sight but which is certainly not yet present .",
    "the pressure of black - body photons is simply @xmath103 .",
    "since the chemical potential exactly vanishes in the case of a photon gas at the thermodynamic equilibrium , the entropy density of the black - body is given , through the fundamental identity of thermodynamics ( see appendix [ appb ] ) , by @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the entropy and @xmath106 is a fiducial volume .",
    "equation ( [ sgamma ] ) implies that the entropic content of the present universe is dominated by the species that are relativistic today ( i.e. photons ) and that the total entropy contained in the hubble volume , i.e. @xmath105 is _",
    "the hubble volume can be thought as the present size of our observable universe and it is roughly given by @xmath107 .",
    "thus , we will have that @xmath108 the figure provided by eq .",
    "( [ sg ] ) is still one of the major problems of the standard cosmological model . why is the entropy of the observable universe so large ?",
    "note for the estimate of eq .",
    "( [ sg ] ) it is practical to express both @xmath37 and @xmath109 in planck units , namely : @xmath110 it is clear that the huge value of the present entropy is a direct consequence of the smallness of @xmath109 in planck units .",
    "this implies that @xmath111 .",
    "let us just remark that the present estimate only concerns the usual entropy , i.e. the thermodynamic entropy .",
    "considerations related with the validity ( also in the early universe ) of the second law of thermodynamics seem to suggest that also the entropy of the gravitational field itself may play a decisive rle . while some motivations seem to be compelling there is no consensus , at the moment , on what should be the precise mathematical definition of the entropy of the gravitational field .",
    "this remark is necessary since we should keep our minds open .",
    "it may well be that the true entropy of the universe ( i.e. the entropy of the sources and of the gravitational field ) is larger than the one computed in eq .",
    "( [ sg ] ) . along this direction",
    "it is possible to think that the maximal entropy that can be stored inside the hubble radius @xmath112 is of the order of a black - hole with radius @xmath112 which would give @xmath113    in connection with eq .",
    "( [ num ] ) , it is also useful to point out that the critical density can be expressed directly in terms of the fourth power of the planck mass , i.e. : @xmath114 the huge hierarchy between the critical energy density of the present universe and the planckian energy density is , again , a direct reflection of the hierarchy between the hubble parameter and the planck mass .",
    "such a hierarchy would not be , by itself , problematic .",
    "the rationale for such a statement is connected to the fact that in the scm the energy densities as well as the related pressures decrease as the universe expand .",
    "however , it turns out that , today , the largest portion of the energy density of the universe is determined by a component called _ dark energy_. the term _ dark _ is a coded word of astronomy .",
    "it means that a given form of matter neither absorbs nor emit radiation . furthermore the dark energy is homogeneously distributed and , unlike _ dark matter _",
    ", is not concentrated in the galactic halos and in the clusters of galaxies .",
    "now , one of the chief properties of dark energy is that it is not affected by the universe expansion and this is the reason why it is usually parametrized in terms of a cosmological constant .",
    "measurements tell us that @xmath115 which implies , from eq .",
    "( [ crit2 ] ) that @xmath116 since @xmath117 _ does not _ decreases with the expansion of the universe , we have also to admit that eq .",
    "( [ rholambda ] ) was enforced at any moment in the life of the universe and , in particular at the moment when the initial conditions of the scm were set . a related way of phrasing this impasse relies on the field theoretical interpretation of the cosmological constant . in field theory we do know that the zero - point ( vacuum ) fluctuations have an energy density ( per logarithmic interval of frequency ) that goes as @xmath118 . now , adopting the planck mass as the ultraviolet cut - off we would be led to conclude that the total energy density of the zero - point vacuum fluctuations would be of the order of @xmath119 . on the contrary",
    ", the result of the measurements simply gives us a figure which is @xmath120 orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "the expression of the black - body spectrum also allows the calculation of the photon concentration . recalling that , in the case of photons , @xmath121 we have , after integration over @xmath122 that the concentration of photons is given by @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the riemann zeta function with argument @xmath100 .      in summary we can therefore answer , in the first approximation , to the title of this lecture series :    * in the electromagnetic spectrum the contribution of",
    "the cmb is by far larger than the other branches and constitutes , roughly , the 93 % of the whole emission ; * the cmb energy density is comparable with ( but larger than ) the energy density of cosmic rays ; * the cmb energy density is a tiny fraction of the total energy density of the universe ( more precisely 24 millionth of the critical energy density ) ; * the cmb dominates the total entropy of the present hubble patch : @xmath125 .",
    "the fact that we observe a cmb seems implies that cmb photons are in thermal equilibrium at the temperature @xmath37 .",
    "this occurrence strongly suggests that the evolution of the whole universe must be somehow adiabatic .",
    "this observation is one of the cornerstones of the standard cosmological model ( scm ) whose precise formulation will be given in the following section .    in a preliminary perspective",
    ", the following naive observation is rather important .",
    "suppose that the spatial coordinates expand thanks to a time - dependent rescaling .",
    "consequently the wave - numbers will be also rescaled accordingly , i.e. @xmath126 in the jargon @xmath127 is commonly referred to as the comoving wave - number ( which is insensitive to the expansion ) , while @xmath128 is the physical wave - number .",
    "consider then the number of photons contained in an infinitesimal element of the phase - space and suppose that the whole universe expands according to eq .",
    "( [ rescaling ] ) . at a generic time",
    "@xmath129 we will then have @xmath130 at a generic time @xmath131 we will have , similarly , @xmath132 by looking at eqs .",
    "( [ timet1 ] ) and ( [ timet2 ] ) it is rather easy to argue that @xmath133 _ provided _ @xmath134 . by looking at the specific form of the bose - einstein occupation number",
    "it is clear that the latter occurrence is verified provided @xmath135 .",
    "from this simple argument we can already argue an important fact : the black - body distribution is preserved under the rescaling ( [ rescaling ] ) provided the black - body temperature scales as the inverse of the scale factor @xmath136 , i.e. @xmath137 the property summarized in eq .",
    "( [ sct ] ) holds also in the context of the scm where @xmath136 will be correctly defined as the time - dependent scale factor of a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe . the physical consequence of eq .",
    "( [ sct ] ) is that the temperature of cmb photons is higher at higher redshifts ( see appendix a for a definition of redshift ) .",
    "more precisely : @xmath138 this consequence of the theory can be tested experimentally @xcite . in short",
    ", the argument goes as follows .",
    "the cmb will populate excited levels of atomic and molecular species when the energy separations involved are not too different from the peak of the cmb emission .",
    "the first measurement of the local cmb temperature was actually made with this method by using the fine structure lines of cn ( cyanogen ) @xcite . using the same philosophy it is reasonable to expect that clouds of other chemical elements ( like carbon , in ref .",
    "@xcite ) may be sensitive to cmb photons also at higher redshifts .",
    "for instance in @xcite measurements were performed at @xmath139 and the estimated temperature was found to be of the order of @xmath140 @xmath141 .",
    "these measurements are potentially very instructive but have been a bit neglected , in the recent past , since the attention of the community focused more on the properties of cmb anisotropies .    for the limitations imposed to the present script",
    "it is not possible to treat in detail the very interesting physics of another important effect that gives us important informations concerning the cmb and its primeval origin .",

    "the point of view of lematre was , in a sense , more radical since he suggested , in 1931 , that the expansion really did start with the beginning of the entire universe .",

    "complementary discussions on the concept of distance in cosmology and on the kinetic description of hot plasmas are collected , respectively , in appendix a and in appendix b.      the standard cosmological model ( scm ) rests on the following three important assumptions :    * for typical length - scales larger than @xmath143 mpc the universe is homogeneous and isotropic ; * the matter content of the universe can be parametrized in terms of perfect barotropic fluids ; * the dynamical law connecting the evolution of the sources to the evolution of the geometry is provided by general relativity ( gr ) .",

    "it is then argued that , when the scalar potential dominates over the spatial gradients and over the kinetic energy of the scalar degree of freedom the geometry is led to inflate . in a slightly more quantitative perspective we shall demand that the aforementioned conditions should be verified over a spatial region of typical size @xmath621 where @xmath533 , as explained in section [ sec4 ] , is a newly formed event horizon at the cosmic time @xmath532 .",

    "a very useful strategy will now be to write the friedmann - lematre equations in a fully inhomogeneous form , i.e. in a form where the spatial gradients are not neglected .",
    "from this set of equations it will be possible to expand the metric to a given order in the spatial gradients , i.e. we will have that the zeroth - order solution will not contain any gradient , the first - order iteration will contain two spatial gradients , the second - order solution will contain four spatial gradients and so on . this kind of perturbative expansion has been pioneered , in the late sixties and in the seventies , by lifshitz , khalatnikov @xcite , and by belinskii and khalatnikov @xcite .",
    "there are various applications of this formalism to inflationary cosmology @xcite as well as to dark energy models ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) . in the present framework , the fully inhomogeneous approach will be simply employed in order to justify the following statements :    *",
    "if the ( total ) barotropic index of the sources is such that @xmath622 the spatial gradients will be relevant for large values of the cosmic time coordinate ( i.e. , formally , @xmath623 ) but they will be negligible in the opposite limit ( i.e. @xmath624 ) ; * if the total barotropic index is smaller than @xmath275 the situation is reversed : the spatial gradients will become more and more subleading as time goes by but they will be of upmost importance in the limit of small cosmic times ; * if @xmath625 the contribution of the spatial gradients remains constant .    the second point of the above list of items will justify why spatial gradients can be neglected as inflation proceeds . at the same time , it should be stressed that the announced analysis does not imply that the inflationary dynamics is _",

    "in cosmology there are different concepts of distance .",

    ". therefore we can ask what is the distance light travelled from the observed galaxy to the receiver ( that we may take , for instance , located at the origin of the coordinate system ) .",
    "but we could also ask what was the actual distance of the galaxy at the time the signal was emitted . or we can ask the distance of the galaxy now . furthermore , distances in frw models depend upon the matter content .",
    "if we would know precisely the matter content we would also know accurately the distance .",

    "different distance concepts can therefore be introduced such as :    * the proper coordinate distance ; * the redshift ; * the distance measure ; * the angular diameter distance ; * the luminosity distance .    in what follows",
    "these different concepts will be swiftly introduced and physically motivated .",
    "the first idea coming to mind to define a distance is to look at a radial part of the frw line element and define the coordinate distance to @xmath320 as @xmath1753 where , conventionally , the origin of the coordinate system coincides with the position of the observer located while @xmath320 defines the position of the emitter . since @xmath122 can be either positive , or negative or even zero , the integral at the right hand side of eq .",

    "( [ pdist ] ) is that it involves geometrical quantities that are not directly accessible through observations .",
    "a directly observable quantity , at least in principle , is the redshift and , therefore it will be important to substantiate the dependence of the distance upon the redshift and this will lead to complementary ( and commonly used ) definitions of distance .    before plunging into the discussion a lexical remark is in order .",
    "it should be clarified that the distance @xmath320 is _ fixed _ and it is an example of _ comoving coordinate _ system . on the contrary , the distance @xmath1755 ( we consider , for simplicity , the spatially flat case )",
    "is called _ physical _ distance since it gets stretched as the scale factor expands .",
    "it is a matter of convenience to use either comoving or physical systems of units .",
    "for instance , in the treatment of the inhomogeneities , it is practical to use comoving wavelengths and wave - numbers . in different situations physical frequencies are more appropriate .",
    "it is clear that physical distances make sense at a given moment in the life of the universe .",
    "for instance , the hubble radius at the electroweak epoch will be of the order of the cm",
    ". the same quantity , evaluated today , will be much larger ( and of the order of the astronomical unit , i.e. @xmath1756 cm ) since the universe expanded a lot between a temperature of @xmath453 gev and the present temperature ( of the order of @xmath1757 gev ) .",
    "in contrast , comoving distances are the same at any time in the life of the universe . a possible convention ( which is , though , not strictly necessary ) is to normalize to @xmath269 the present value of the scale factor so that , today , physical and comoving distances would coincide .",
    "suppose that a galaxy or a cloud of gas emits electromagnetic radiation of a given wavelength @xmath1758 .",
    "the wavelength received by the observer will be denoted by @xmath1759 .",
    "if the universe would not be expanding we would simply have that @xmath1760 .",

    "if the wavelength of the emitted radiation would be precisely known ( for instance a known emission line of the hydrogen atom or of some other molecule or chemical compound ) the amount of expansion ( i.e. the redshift ) between the emission and the observation could be accurately determined .",
    "equation ( [ reds1 ] ) can be directly justified from the frw line element .",

    "bbn is the process where light nuclei are formed .",
    "approximately one quarter of the baryonic matter in the universe is in the form of @xmath270 .",
    "the remaining part is made , predominantly , by hydrogen in its different incarnations ( atomic , molecular and ionized ) . during bbn the protons and neutrons ( formed during the quark - hadron phase transition )",
    "combine to form nuclei . according to eq .",
    "( [ htime ] ) the quark - hadron phase transition takes place when the universe is old of @xmath2011 to be compared with @xmath2012 . during bbn only light nuclei",
    "are formed and , more specifically , @xmath270 , @xmath271 , @xmath433 , @xmath272 .",
    "the reason why the @xmath270 is the most abundant element has to do with the fact that , @xmath270 has the largest binding energy for nuclei with atomic number @xmath2013 ( corresponding to carbon ) .",
    "light nuclei provide stars with the initial set of reactions necessary to turn on the synthesis of heavier elements ( iron , cobalt and so on ) .    in short ,",
    "the logic of bbn is the following :    * after the quark - hadron phase transition the antinucleons annihilate with the nucleons , thus the total baryon concentration will be given by @xmath2014 ; * if the baryon number is conserved ( as it is rather plausible ) the baryon concentration will stay constant and , in particular , it will be @xmath2015 ; * for temperatures lower than @xmath2016 weak interactions fall out of equilibrium ; at this stage the concentrations of neutrons and protons are determined from their equilibrium values and , approximately , @xmath2017 for @xmath2018 mev ; * if nothing else would happen , the neutron concentration would be progressively depleted by free neutron decay , i.e. @xmath2019 ; * however , when @xmath2020 mev the reactions for the formation of the deuterium ( d ) are in equilibrium , i.e. @xmath2021 and @xmath2022 ; * the reactions for the formation of deuterium fall out of thermal equilibrium only at a much lower temperature ( i.e. @xmath2023 mev ) ; * as soon as deuterium is formed , @xmath270 and @xmath271 can arise according to the following chain of reactions : @xmath2024    as soon as the helium is formed a little miracle happens : since the temperature of equilibration of the helium is rather large ( i.e. @xmath2025 mev ) , the helium is not in equilibrium at the moment when it is formed .",
    "in fact the helium can only be formed when deuterium is already present . as a consequence the reactions ( [ he1 ] ) and ( [ he2 ] )",
    "only take place from right to left .",
    "when the deuterium starts being formed , free neutron decay has already depleted a bit the neutron to proton ratio which is equal to @xmath2026 . since each",
    "@xmath270 has two neutrons , we have that @xmath2027 nuclei of @xmath270 can be formed per unit volume . therefore , the @xmath270 mass fraction will be @xmath2028 the abundances of the other light elements are comparatively smaller than the one of @xmath270 and , in particular : @xmath2029 the abundances of the light elements computed from bbn calculations agree with the observations .",
    "the simplest bbn scenario implies that the only two free parameters are the temperature and what has been called @xmath381 i.e. the baryon to photon ratio which must be of the order of @xmath2030 to agree with experimental data .",
