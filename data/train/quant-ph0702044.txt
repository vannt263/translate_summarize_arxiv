    "[ ghz ] gives the mixed state which would result if a 3-photon ghz state is initiated perfectly , but subsequently each of the photons is lost at a probability rate @xmath46 . to show that the gate in fig .",
    "[ circuit ] produces such a state , we will first assume that losses can only occur at the input , due to imperfect sources which have efficiency @xmath47 .",
    "we will assume that the polarization - sensitive , number - resolving detectors are perfect and show that the gate can produce a 3 photon id - ghz .",
    "later on we will show that this scenario is exactly equivalent to a scenario where we have both imperfect sources and imperfect detectors .    the circuit shown fig .",
    "[ circuit ] post - selects only the outcomes where there is one and only one photon detected at each of the separate 3 detectors .",
    "we will now attempt to construct the mixed state that is received at the output when the detection pattern at the detectors corresponds to such correct detection outcomes .",
    "the convention that we will be using throughout for the labeling of the spatial modes in the circuit is that they continue in straight lines .",
    "in other words a spatial mode is transmitted through a polarizing beamsplitter ( pbs ) .",
    "we would investigate 4 distinct cases , where in each case a different number of photons is lost .",
    "these are the cases where 0 , 1 , 2 or 3 photons are lost . obviously if 4 or more photons",
    "are lost it is impossible to post - select a correct detection pattern .",
    "since we have lossy components , we expect the final state to be a mixed state of the form :      where @xmath49 is the re - normalized probability of having an @xmath50  -  photon state in the final mixture given by the @xmath51 density operator .",
    "ultimately we would like to show that @xmath52 takes the form of eqn .",
    "( [ ghz ] ) as this would be proof that the circuit does indeed produce an id - ghz state at the output .",
    "first we will look at the state as soon as all 6 photons pass through the 3 pbs s rotated at @xmath10 . from now on we will use the notation pbs45@xmath53 to refer to a pbs placed on spatial modes labeled @xmath50 and @xmath54 .",
    "the action of pbs45@xmath53 acting on a pair of photons in state @xmath55 is : @xmath56    clearly the terms which lead to 2 photons in the same spatial mode can not contribute to a successful detection pattern since in such instances the photons have the same polarization and are destined to end up at the same detector , triggering an erroneous detection outcome .",
    "thus the only terms that survive to ( possibly ) lead to a correct detection pattern are the ones which have just one photon at each separate spatial mode .      at this point",
    "we need to consider how the state evolves after the action of the two pbs s mixing modes 1 and 4 , and modes 1 and 6 respectively . from now on we will use the notation pbs@xmath59 to refer to a pbs mixing modes @xmath50 and @xmath54 .",
    "the convention we will use for any pbs in the circuit is that it transmits horizontally polarized photons and reflects vertically polarized photons .",
    "this can be summarized as follows :        clearly the term involving @xmath63 can not contribute to a correct detection outcome as it leads with certainty to an outcome involving 2 photon detections at the detector in spatial mode 4 . similarly neither the term involving @xmath64 can lead to a correct detection outcome as it leads with certainty to an outcome with no detections at the detector in mode 4 . since we only post select the results involving one photon being detected at this detector then the part of the state which may lead to such an outcome is : @xmath65    after the action of the pbs@xmath66 this becomes : @xmath67 again we can see that the terms involving @xmath68 and @xmath69 can not contribute to a correct detection outcome since the first term leads with certainty to 2 photons be detected at the detector in spatial mode 6 whereas the second leads to 2 photons to be detected at the detector in mode 1 .",
    "thus the only terms from this state which could lead to a correct detection pattern are : @xmath70 by applying the three 45@xmath57-polarization rotators found prior to the three detectors at modes 1 , 4 and 6 we find that the only term involving @xmath71 that survives is : @xmath72 this is one possible correct detection pattern out of a total of 8 possible correct detection patterns ( e.g. @xmath73 , @xmath74 etc",
    ". will work as well ) .",
    "( [ hhh0 ] ) suggests that the probability with which the initial 6 photon state ends up with @xmath75 at the output with all three detectors firing with one horizontally polarized photon is 1/256 .",
    "note that one can easily show that the remaining possible correct detection outcomes occur with the same probability of 1/256 and they give rise to states that are locally equivalent to @xmath75 .",
    "thus assuming that the local corrections are applied the overall success probability for the gate to produce the ghz state is 1/32 .",
    "we will now look at the case where one photon is lost , and initially also assume that this photon comes from the pair of photons initially found in input modes 1 or 2 .",
    "let us define the two variables , @xmath79 and @xmath80 such that the value of any given @xmath81 is 0 if the photon in input mode @xmath50 is not present and 1 if indeed it is present .    in other words if we want to check the case where one and only one photon is lost from the pair of input modes 1 and 2 .",
    "the variables @xmath79 and @xmath80 can be described by the equations : @xmath82 the equations above make sure that one photon is lost from the pair of modes 1 and 2 .",
    "note there are 2 possible solutions .",
    "initially the 5 qubit state is taken to be one of the two possible states given by : @xmath83 note that the exact state depends on the particular solution out of the two possible solutions to the system of equations given in eqn .",
    "( [ onelost ] ) .",
    "here we are just using eqn .",
    "( [ p1p2 ] ) as a convenient algebraic way for checking simultaneously both possible solutions arising from different initial input states .",
    "( [ onelost ] ) make sure that the state @xmath89 contains at most one photon .",
    "thus by linearity we can apply the action summarized in eqn .",
    "( [ pbs45 ] ) to deduce that the state after the action of the pbs45@xmath85 evolves to : @xmath90\\textrm{.}\\ ] ] hence after applying eqns .",
    "( [ onelost ] ) this becomes : @xmath91 however the only part of this state that can yield a final correct detection pattern is : @xmath92    the reason lies in the fact that the 3 pairs of input modes shown in fig .",
    "[ circuit ] must each provide one of the photons which finally ends up in a detector , in order for a successful detection outcome to be possible .    to see this",
    "consider the example where there is no contribution from pair 1 .",
    "this means that the only way that the detector at mode 4 could click with one and only one photon is if only one photon is present in mode 4 after the action of pbs45@xmath93 .",
    "the reason for this is that if there are two photons in this mode after the action of the pbs45@xmath93 then necessarily they must be in the same polarization as indicated by eqn .",
    "( [ t2 ] ) . that would suggest that _ both _ or _ none _ of them will end up in the detector in mode 4 yielding an unaccepted detection pattern .",
    "if however only one photon ends up in mode 4 after the action of pbs45@xmath93 ( and continues in this spatial mode until it reaches the detector ) , suggests that the two remaining photons initiated in pair 3 ( modes 5 and 6 , c.f .",
    "[ circuit ] ) must somehow end up being detected at the detectors found in modes 1 and 6 ( one photon in each detector ) .",
    "however , this is impossible since if both photons are in mode 6 straight after the action of the pbs45@xmath94 then they will necessarily be in the same polarization mode according to eqn .",
    "( [ t2 ] ) .",
    "thus they will both end up in the same detector - either _ both _ in mode 1 or _ both _ in mode 6 .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that if a photon is lost from pair 1 of input modes , then the surviving photon _ must _ end up in a detector in order to have any chance of an overall correct detection pattern in the gate .",
    "it turns out that the same logic can be applied to the cases of pairs 2 and 3 of input modes , and therefore one can conclude that the only possible way for receiving a correct detection pattern for the gate is only if all three photons that are finally detected in the three separate detectors registering a correct detection outcome originate from a distinct pair of input modes .    now that we have established that eqn .",
    "( [ lost1 ] ) gives the state which can lead to a correct detection outcome after the action of the three pbs45@xmath57 , and after proceeding with the action of the pbs@xmath61 , the resulting state is : @xmath95\\textrm{.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] post - selecting on the part of the state which has one and only one photon left in mode 4 gives : @xmath96 comparing with case i , we are at the same stage when the state that could possibly yield a correct detection pattern was given by eqn .",
    "( [ beforerotators ] ) .",
    "the difference now is that in this case a photon in mode 2 is missing ( plus the factor of @xmath97 which is equal to 1 if initially the a photon was absent from mode 2 , and -1 if it was absent from mode 1 ) .    by following the same steps as we did for case i",
    "we find that the term in the state which survives to give a correct detection pattern corresponding to @xmath71 is : @xmath98 this suggests that the probability with which the initial 5 photon state ends up with @xmath99 ( if initially the photon in mode 2 was missing ) or @xmath100 ( if initially the photon in mode 1 was missing ) at the output with all three detectors firing with one horizontally polarized photon is 1/256 .",
    "note that the remaining possible seven detection outcomes involving one photon detected at a separate detector occur with the same probability of 1/256 and they give rise to states that are locally equivalent to @xmath99 or @xmath100 depending which photon from the initial pair was lost .",
    "thus the overall probability of ending up with @xmath99 or @xmath100 at the output is 1/32 .",
    "following the same logic one can show that for the rest of the four possibilities of operating the gate with 5 photons ( i.e the four cases where photons in initial modes 3 , 4 , 5 or 6 are not present ) can lead to an output state @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 or @xmath104 again with a probability of 1/32 . since the probability of having 5 photons at the input is given by @xmath105",

    "we will now look at the case where one photon is lost from pair 1 ( modes 1 and 2 ) and one photon from pair 2 ( modes 3 and 4 ) .",
    "remember that we already eliminated the possibility of having 2 photons lost from the same pair as with such a scenario is impossible to end up with one photon arriving at each separate detector which is the indication of a correct measurement pattern .    similarly to case ii we will define the variables @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 for each of the input modes 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 respectively , which are described by the equations : @xmath111 eqns .",

    "<S> that is , the states must be equivalent to an initially ideal cluster state of which each qubit has passed through an independent ( uncorrelated ) loss channel . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the loss tolerant protocol in @xcite is much less robust to correlated errors .    our description of a strategy to achieve the main result proceeds as follows . </S>",
    "<S> first we present a method for creating 3 photon id - ghz states from an initial resource of 6 single photons . </S>",
    "<S> the effective loss rate of this state is a function of the efficiencies of the sources / detectors used in its creation , and this is the only step in which number - resolving detectors are required . </S>",
    "<S> next , we discuss the manner in which type - ii fusion is inherently loss tolerant - when successfully applied to i d cluster states it generates an i d state with the same effective loss rate as the input states . </S>",
    "<S> after a brief discussion of how tree cluster states achieve their loss tolerant properties we present a method to efficiently grow such states given the initial 3 photon i d ghz states . </S>",
    "<S> we then describe a method for joining such tree clusters so as to produce a state capable of achieving universal quantum computation .    _ creating initial ghz states : _ a scheme for creating an initial resource of ghz states </S>",
    "<S> is given in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ makeghz ] . </S>",
    "<S> whenever three photons are detected at any three of the detectors , the remaining three photons are projected into a state locally equivalent to the three photon ghz state . </S>",
    "<S> heuristically the interferometer in this figure can be understood as follows : the three initial pairs of photons go through a rotated pbs , so that the one - photon per mode part of their state is a @xmath6 state . </S>",
    "<S> this will be post - selected and simultaneously fused by the remaining operations . </S>",
    "<S> the first pair of bell states is type - i fused , then one member of the second bell pair undergoes a type - ii operation with one member of the third bell pair .     a simple procedure for projecting 6 single photons into a three photon ghz state . </S>",
    "<S> success occurs when three of the detectors detect a single photon.,width=302 ]    recall that we consider sources which are of the form that if any photons are present , then at most one photon is present . </S>",
    "<S> let the efficiency of the sources ( as defined in the introduction ) be @xmath1 , and that of the detectors be @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> in the particular scheme of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ makeghz ] , if the gate is successful then somewhat tedious calculations ( c.f  appendix  a ) reveal that the state of the remaining three photons are collapsed to an i d ghz state which has a loss rate @xmath7 . in the rest of the paper </S>",
    "<S> we show that loss - tolerant cluster states with an i d loss rate of @xmath8 can be constructed efficiently . </S>",
    "<S> since , once we take the inefficiencies of single - qubit measurements into account , the protocol @xcite has a loss threshold of @xmath9 this implies our main result .    </S>",
    "<S> the reason we require ghz states initially ( as opposed to bell states , which sufficed in @xcite ) is that all subsequent steps of the protocol are going to use type - ii fusion , which destroys two photons on each application ( type - i fusion unfortunately does not have the same natural loss tolerance properties ) . fusing 3-photon ghz states allows for the creation of four - photon ( and larger ) ghz states by postselection on successful fusions in a straightforward manner , and it is then clear that if there are no lossy failures , arbitrary cluster states can be built using type - ii fusion alone . </S>",
    "<S> if losses during the construction of the state are considered , however , growing suitable clusters efficiently is rather more complex .    </S>",
    "<S> _ loss tolerance of type - ii fusion : _ recall the type - ii fusion gate is essentially a polarizing beamsplitter ( pbs ) oriented at @xmath10 @xcite , which implements a destructive bell state projection when it succeeds . </S>",
    "<S> success occurs when one ( and only one ) photon is detected at two independent detectors in the output modes of the gate . </S>",
    "<S> we classify as failure all other detection outcomes . such failures can arise when two photons emerge in a single mode , or when loss or detector inefficiency causes only one photon to be detected . in the ideal case , </S>",
    "<S> the success probability of the type - ii fusion is 50% . </S>",
    "<S> provided there is at most one photon in each mode , this gate is robust to loss errors and detector inefficiencies , because when two detectors click the desired case of one photon being present in each input mode _ must _ have been the case . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the loss errors ( imperfect sources , detectors or absorptive components ) will be to reduce the success probability . </S>",
    "<S> significantly , however , a successful type - ii preserves the i d property of the input state . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , successfully fusing an @xmath11-photon i d state with an @xmath12-photon i d state , both with loss rate @xmath8 , leaves an @xmath13 photon state which remains i d with the _ same _ loss rate @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the type - ii gate does not introduce dangerous correlated loss errors into the state , nor does it increase the loss rate , even though it is implemented with inefficient detectors .    </S>",
    "<S> _ tree - clusters : a resource for loss - tolerant computation _ : we now briefly review the manner in which tree clusters achieve their loss tolerant properties . </S>",
    "<S> these states are fully specified by their branching parameters @xmath14 which give the number of qubits in the @xmath15 level a qubit in the @xmath16 level branches out to . </S>",
    "<S> when such trees are used to encode qubits in a cluster state used for a computation ( see @xcite for details ) , then a plethora of alternative measurement patterns become available for implementing a specific encoded single qubit measurement in some arbitrary basis . </S>",
    "<S> this allows a loss tolerant strategy which , by increasing the number of tree qubits , can boost the effective success probability for the measurement arbitrarily close to one , provided each individual measurement has an individual likelyhood to succeed of at least 1/2 .    the basis of this loss tolerance is `` counter - factual '' error correction . at instances where a specific qubit is lost , </S>",
    "<S> the special quantum correlations present on the tree cluster states allow `` indirect measurements '' . </S>",
    "<S> in other words the outcome of a measurement which could have occured , had the qubit not been lost , can be inferred by measurements on other surviving qubits . </S>",
    "<S> one can then proceed with an alternative measurement pattern which is still suitable for implementing the original logical operation .    </S>",
    "<S> _ building tree - clusters in the presence of loss : _ type - ii fusing one photon from each of two 3-photon ghz states yields , when successful , a 4-photon ghz state , and we will take these to be our basic resources for tree cluster creation . by applying local hadamard gates to two of the qubits in a 4-qubit ghz state , one creates a three - qubit tree cluster state , where the central qubit is redundantly encoded in the two - qubit basis @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> we will term this basic resource a `` 2-tree '' . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ strategy](a ) and ( b ) indicates how two 2-trees can be type - ii fused together into a 4-tree , maintaining the redundant encoding at the top of the tree .    </S>",
    "<S> given a supply / resource of 2-trees , we wish to show that one can efficiently generate arbitrary tree cluster states . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved by building a tree with branching parameters \\{@xmath18 } from bottom to top as follows .    </S>",
    "<S> first we use type - ii gates and combine 2-trees to form 4-trees . </S>",
    "<S> then we repeat the process by fusing 4-trees to create 8-trees , and so on until a sufficient resource of @xmath19-trees is created . </S>",
    "<S> any given type - ii fusion succeeds with probability @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> this is because @xmath21 is the probability of both photons being present in their appropriate cluster ( which is given above for one specific proposal for producing ghz states ) , @xmath22 is the probability both detectors fire appropriately , and @xmath23 is the intrinsic optimal success probability of a type - ii gate even if both photons are present and the detectors are perfect . thus , for any integer number @xmath24 , the expected cost for creating one @xmath25-tree from two @xmath26-trees is @xmath27 @xmath26-trees . the expected cost for creating a @xmath25-tree from 2-trees is then @xmath28 2-trees . </S>",
    "<S> further , it can be readily shown that in order to create a @xmath19-tree such that @xmath29 , then on average the number of 2-trees required is @xmath30poly(@xmath19 ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( note that in the event of a failure - regardless of the type - we simply discard all qubits involved . while clearly not optimal from a resource perspective , this suffices to show the desired scaling to attain a proper fault tolerant threshold . )    </S>",
    "<S> next we add a higher level of qubits by first joining a pair of the cluster states created in the previous step with a single 2-tree using two type - ii gates as shown on figure [ strategy ] ( c ) . </S>",
    "<S> subject to both gates succeeding , the resulting state is be the one shown on figure  [ strategy](d ) . </S>",
    "<S> this now is a tree cluster state consisting of a redundantly encoded qubit at the top that is branching out to 2 qubits in the next lower level , each of which branch out to @xmath19 qubits in the last level . since we require two type - ii gates to succeed in this step , the expected number of 2-trees consumed in order to create a single such state is @xmath31 ) .    by creating a sufficient supply of these new cluster states we can now increase the branching parameter on the top level from 2 to @xmath32 by combining these tree clusters together , much as we combined the initial 2-trees into @xmath33 trees </S>",
    "<S> that is , successfully type - ii fusing together a photon from the redundantly encoded qubit from 2 of these trees creates new tree clusters where the top level branching would then be equal to 4 ; fusing those together increases the branching to 8 etc . </S>",
    "<S> repeating the process can increase the branching value to @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> this increases the resource overhead in the number of 2-trees required to @xmath34poly(@xmath19 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the extra added level with branching parameter @xmath32 incurs an increasing factor of @xmath35poly(@xmath32 ) in the 2-trees overhead .    </S>",
    "<S> iterating the process in order to add all the levels suggests that in order to create one tree cluster state with the full branching parameter profile : \\{@xmath18 } ( as required in @xcite ) then the expected number of 2-trees required satisfies @xmath36 the overall conclusion is that the expected number of qubits consumed in order to build a tree containing @xmath37 qubits is polynomial in @xmath37 , since @xmath38 .     </S>",

    "<S> they have been left in the diagram for illustrative purposes . </S>",

    "<S> this is achieved using a strategy similar , at the level of encoded qubits , to those strategies proposed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we start with an @xmath11-qubit linear cluster and a @xmath42qubit cluster state , of which qubit is redundantly encoded as illustrated in figure [ treestocluster ] ( this is locally equivalent to a 3-qubit ghz state ) . </S>",
    "<S> successful application of a type - ii fusion gate between qubits creates an @xmath11 + 1 linear cluster . </S>",
    "<S> a similar approach can be employed to create loss - encoded linear clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the type - ii fusion on the encoded qubits proceeds in an analogous manner to the loss - tolerant single qubit measurements in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fusion measurement is applied to a pair of `` first row '' qubits , as illustrated in figure [ treestocluster ] , and remaining tree qubits are measured out in accordance to the loss tolerant strategy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> loss errors in the type - ii fusion are dealt with in the same way as before . </S>",
    "<S> when the type - ii fusion gate fails it can be treated as a loss error . </S>",
    "<S> note that this means that at the level of encoded qubits the failure probability of the fusion can be made arbitrarily small .    </S>",
    "<S> thus an @xmath11 encoded qubit linear cluster can be built at a cost of @xmath11 tree - encoded three - ghz states . following the methods above , </S>",
    "<S> these states can themselves be built ( for example ) by post - selected fusion of three tree clusters and a 4-photon linear cluster state at a cost of @xmath43 2-trees .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusion : _ our primary purpose in this paper has been to show that an extremely relaxed error threshold exists for some of the primary error mechanisms expected to be crucial to the eventual viability of linear optical quantum computation .    </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that our threshold trade - off can be improved - fall that is required is a better linear optical scheme for producing three photon i d ghz states than the one we have outlined , which we have made no attempt to optimize .    </S>",
    "<S> there are clearly many ways in which the resource consumption of our scheme can be lowered . in the methods </S>",
    "<S> above we have made no attempts to recycle states after gate `` failures '' and to do so would greatly reduce the overhead , especially when efficiencies are significantly above the threshold . </S>",
    "<S> although the experimental requirements of the current scheme seem forbidding , we are confident that experiments demonstrating the principles of elements of this schemes are within current laboratory feasibility . </S>",
    "<S> the development of loss tolerant protocols with a more compact resource count remains an important and challenging area for future research . </S>"
