    "two - particle bose - einstein ( be ) interferometry ( also known as hanbury brown - twiss ( hbt ) intensity interferometry ) as a method for obtaining information on the space - time geometry and dynamics of high energy collisions has recently received intensive theoretical and experimental attention .",
    "detailed investigations revealed that high - quality two - particle correlation data constrain not only the geometric size of the particle - emitting source but also its dynamical state at particle freeze - out @xcite .",
    "two different definitions of two - pion correlation function are employed in the literature @xcite .",
    "the first starts from the measured invariant @xmath0-pion inclusive distribution @xmath1 which is normalized via @xmath2 to the @xmath0th order factorial moment of the pion multiplicity distribution , and defines the two - particle correlator as @xmath3 the second definition instead employs the normalized @xmath0-pion production probability @xmath4 and defines @xmath5 it follows that @xmath6    recently , mikowiec and voloshin @xcite argued that the first definition is preferable because it is based directly on measured quantities and it is consistent with the often used theoretical expression @xmath7 here @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the emission function of the source . in this paper",
    "we will stress that the first definition has the additional advantage that it provides information not only about _ the shape of the correlator _ , but also through its normalization about _ the pion multiplicity distribution _ which is lost in the second definition .",
    "we will show that it can be exploited to search for multi - pion symmetrization effects and may thus be a useful ingredient in the hbt analysis of 2-pion correlation functions .",
    "to illustrate the importance of the normalization of the 2-pion correlator let us start with a simple example in which we consider the following multi - pion states : @xmath12 |0\\rangle \\ , ,   \\label{xx1}\\\\     \\hat b^\\dagger & = & \\int d^3p\\ , j(\\bbox{p})\\ , a^\\dagger(\\bbox{p } ) .   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the states ( [ 7 ] ) are normalizable for @xmath13 ; the normalization @xmath14 ensures @xmath15 . for @xmath16",
    ", @xmath17 is a standard coherent state @xcite with @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "then the pion multiplicity distribution is of poisson form , @xmath20 and the two - pion correlators ( [ i ] ) and ( [ ii ] ) are given by @xmath21 for @xmath22 we have @xmath23 , and the pion multiplicity distribution is given by @xmath24 calculating the correlation functions we find @xmath25 one observes that now @xmath26 is different from @xmath27 due to the fact that the pion multiplicity distribution is no longer of poisson form .",
    "however , although @xmath28 is clearly not a coherent state , @xmath27 is again equal to @xmath29 .",
    "the use of the second definition ( [ ii ] ) thus does not allow to distinguish between the states @xmath30 and @xmath31 , whereas the first definition ( [ i ] ) clearly does .",
    "one may , of course , argue that the only difference between @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the normalization factor which can be obtained independently by measuring the pion multiplicity distribution .",
    "our point is that important information on the pion multiplicity distribution can also be extracted directly from the properly normalized correlation function , and that this opportunity should not be given away by working with probabilities rather than directly with the measured cross sections .",
    "we will now consider a more physical model and show again that the use of the second definition leads to a loss of interesting information about the source .",
    "it is well known that in relativistic heavy - ion collisions the pion multiplicity is so large that it may be necessary to take multi - pion be correlations into account @xcite . in the following",
    "we will use a specific class of density matrices for multi - pion systems @xcite to study multi - pion be correlation effects on the two - pion correlation function , thereby generalizing the conclusions of ref.@xcite . for this class of ensembles",
    "it was shown in @xcite that , after including multi - pion correlation effects , the two - pion and single - pion inclusive distributions can , in the notation of @xcite , be written in the following simple form @xcite : @xmath32\\ , ,   \\\\",
    "\\label{14 }     h({\\bbox{p}_1,\\bbox{p}_2 } ) & = &     \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty } g_i({\\bbox{p}_1,\\bbox{p}_2 } ) \\ , .",

    "( [ i ] ) one obtains @xmath41 this correlator goes to 1 as @xmath42 and to 2 as @xmath43 .",
    "( final state interactions are neglected here . )",
    "thus even dramatic multi - boson effects as discussed below do not affect the intercept of the correlator @xmath44  although they change the multiplicity distribution towards bose - einstein form they do not lead to genuine phase coherence .",
    "explicit expressions for the pion multiplicity distribution and its first two moments @xmath45 , @xmath46 for the model studied here can be found in @xcite . since @xmath47 , the second term in eq .",
    "( [ 17 ] ) is always positive , ensuring that @xmath48 is positive definite .",
    "the normalization conditions ( [ 2 ] ) therefore imply that for the class of systems studied here and in @xcite one has always @xmath49 ( see fig .  3 below ) .",
    "obviously , eq .",
    "( [ 17 ] ) can therefore not apply to systems with multiplicity distributions @xmath50 which give @xmath51 ( e.g. for systems with fixed event multiplicity @xcite ) .",
    "the structure of ( [ 17 ] ) permits to introduce , in analogy to ( [ 16 ] ) , a modified source distribution @xmath11 via @xmath52 such that the correlator ( [ 17 ] ) can be written in the form ( [ corr ] ) .",
    "@xmath11 is related to the original source distribution @xmath36 via eqs .",
    "( [ 14])-([16 ] ) .",
    "it includes all higher order multiparticle be symmetrization effects .",
    "when interpreting measured single particle spectra and two - particle correlations one must keep in mind that the extracted information on the source _ corresponds to the effective source distribution @xmath53 rather than to the emission function @xmath54_. the following example shows that these two functions can differ considerably ; but we will also see that an important clue as to how much they differ will be provided by the normalization of the correlator .    as shown in @xcite the recursion relations for the functions @xmath55 in ( [ 15 ] ) can be solved analytically for the class of model ensembles studied here if the following source distribution @xmath54 is assumed : @xmath56 @xmath57 is the _ wigner _ density of the source in the absence of multi - pion symmetrization effects .",
    "it is obtained in @xcite by folding the wigner densities of individual gaussian wavepackets with a classical phase - space distribution @xmath58 for their centers ( eq .  ( 19 ) in @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath59 in ( [ 21 ] ) are thus combinations of the wavepacket width @xmath60 with the spatial and momentum space widths @xmath61 and @xmath62 of @xmath63 ( see eqs .",
    "( 20,21 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "while the width parameters @xmath64 of the classical distribution @xmath63 are unconstrained , the widths @xmath59 of the wigner density @xmath57 which result from the folding procedure always satisfy the quantum mechanical uncertainty relation @xmath65 .",
    "the _ input _ multiplicity distribution is taken to be poissonian as in ( [ 9 ] ) ; its mean value @xmath66 can be interpreted as the mean pion multiplicity in the absence of bose - einstein correlations @xcite . by inspection of eqs .",
    "( [ 14])-([16 ] ) one easily convinces oneself that the instantaneous character of ( [ 21 ] ) carries over to the effective source distribution @xmath53 .",
    "using the analytical expressions from refs .",
    "@xcite we compute @xmath67    as well as the normalized single - pion probability distribution in momentum space @xmath68 the mean pion multiplicity @xmath69 is given by @xmath70 for the model ( [ 21 ] ) @xmath71 is a function of @xmath72 only .",
    "it is shown in fig .  1 for different _ observed _ average pion multiplicities @xmath69 .",
    "next to the value @xmath69 we also give the average pion phase - space density of the system , @xmath73 one sees that as @xmath74 increases the pions concentrate in momentum space at low momenta .",
    "this reflects their bosonic nature : pions like to be in the same state .",
    "the instantaneous nature of the ( effective ) emission functions @xmath54 and @xmath53 ( see ( [ 21 ] ) ) allows for inversion of the fourier transform ( [ 20 ] ) : writing @xmath75 we have @xmath76    we define the normalized source distribution in coordinate space @xmath77 via @xmath78    due to the spherical symmetry of ( [ 21 ] ) it is a function of @xmath79 only .",
    "the function @xmath80 in ( [ 25],[26 ] ) is known analytically @xcite to be a simple gaussian in @xmath81 , rendering the fourier transform trivial .",
    "the resulting @xmath82 is shown in fig .  2 for different pion phase - space densities .",
    "one sees that with increasing phase - space density the multi - pion be correlations also lead to a concentration of the pions in coordinate space .",
    "the fact that multi - pion be correlations lead to a reduction of the hbt radius has been observed previously @xcite .",
    "the radius extracted from hbt interferometry reflects the typical length scale of @xmath83 ; it is always smaller than the input geometric radius @xmath84 of the source and depends on the mean pion multiplicity per event .",
    "taking the limit of a highly condensed bose gas , @xmath85 @xcite , the multiplicity distribution and 1- and 2-particle spectra can be determined analytically @xcite : @xmath86 in this limit the correlation functions are @xmath87 multi - pion be correlations change the original poisson distribution into the bose - einstein multiplicity distribution ( [ 27 ] ) .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath88 changes from 1 to 2 . in (",
    "[ 18 ] ) this change exactly compensates the fact that the correlator @xmath44 no longer decays as a function of @xmath89 , and from the resulting @xmath90 one might thus be misled to conclude ( incorrectly ) that the source exhibits phase coherence .    in fig .",
    "3 we show the ratio @xmath91 as a function of the average pion phase - space density . in the lower diagram",
    "we plot it as a function of the ratio of input parameters @xmath92 , in the upper diagram we use as a measure of the phase - space density the analogous ratio formed with the _ measured _ average multiplicity @xmath69 . for low phase space densities and large systems",
    "( @xmath93 ) @xmath94 is close to 1 ; be symmetrization effects on the observed multiplicity distribution are then negligible , and it becomes equal to the poissonian input distribution with @xmath95 . for smaller systems ( @xmath96 )",
    "the observed multiplicity distribution becomes non - poissonian , with @xmath97 , even in the limit of vanishing multiplicity , @xmath98 : for the model discussed here one finds analytically @xmath99    for large phase - space densities @xmath100 , the ratio @xmath94 decreases , eventually approaching for @xmath101 the value 0.5 which reflects bose - einstein statistics .",
    "the critical phase - space density for the transition from poisson statistics with @xmath102 to bose - einstein statistics with @xmath103 depends on the total phase - space volume @xmath104 , but for @xmath93 it occurs near @xmath105 . for @xmath106 ,",
    "multi - boson symmetrization effects become dominant .",
    "the bose condensation limit is reached at a finite critical value for the mean input multiplicity @xmath66 : @xmath107 as @xmath66 approaches the critical value ( which for large systems @xmath93 corresponds to @xmath108 ) , the observed mean multiplicity @xmath45 and phase - space density @xmath74 ( as well as the total energy ) go to infinity @xcite . in this sense",
    "the limit @xmath109 here is analogous to the limit @xmath110 in a thermalized pion gas of infinite volume in the grand canonical formalism .",
    "a direct experimental determination of the phase - space density @xmath111 in high energy collisions is not easy .",
    "the sources created in such collisions feature strong collective expansion @xcite , and therefore only small fractions of the total collision region ( so - called regions of homogeneity ) contribute effectively to the two - particle correlator @xcite .",
    "this means that in the parametrization ( [ 21 ] ) we should use @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the ( pair momentum dependent ) homogeneity radius which , in the absence of strong multi - pion effects , is equal to the hbt radius parameter @xmath114 . without more detailed model studies it is then , however , unclear what fraction of the total observed multiplicity @xmath115 comes from a single such homogeneity region .    on the other hand fig .",
    "3 suggests that , within our model class of event ensembles , the ratio @xmath116 is a useful indicator for the average phase - space density @xmath74 in the source and thereby also for the expected multi - pion symmetrization effects on the 1- and 2-particle spectra which need to be taken into account in an extraction of the source size from hbt measurements",
    ".    in the experiment one usually fits the two - particle correlator with the functional form @xmath117 where the function @xmath118 vanishes as @xmath119 . obviously , @xmath120 depends on the chosen definition of the correlation function : for the definition ( [ i ] ) the normalization is always @xmath121 ( see eq .  ( [ 17 ] ) ) , while for the definition ( [ ii ] ) it is @xmath122 ( see eq .",
    "( [ 18 ] ) ) .",
    "but in both cases @xmath120 is well - defined and thus should not be treated as a free fit parameter .",
    "therefore we now discuss shortly an algorithm for the experimental construction of the two - particle correlator which is guaranteed @xcite to give the correct value for @xmath120 , _ without relying on an actual measurement of the multiplicity distribution_.    we write the single - pion inclusive distribution as @xmath123 @xmath124 is the total number of collision events , and @xmath125 is the number of pions with momentum @xmath126 in collision @xmath0 . the two - particle distribution can be expressed as @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the number of pion pairs with momenta @xmath129 in collision event @xmath0 , and the double index @xmath0 indicates that both particles are from the same event .",
    "these definitions satisfy the normalization conditions ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "while @xmath130 is constructed by selecting pion pairs from the same events , the denominator @xmath131 can be generated by combining pion pairs from different events @xcite .",
    "the proper prescription is @xmath132 where @xmath133 .",
    "one easily checks that @xmath134 the ratio of ( [ 35 ] ) and ( [ 36 ] ) thus gives the properly normalized correlator @xmath26 .",
    "the above equations are true for unbiased events .",
    "trigger biases and limited experimental acceptances can induce residual correlations in the event - mixed `` background '' ( [ 36 ] ) which must be corrected for separately ( see @xcite for an extensive discussion ) .    for large @xmath124",
    "the evaluation of ( [ 36 ] ) is very time consuming ; it also leads to a statistically unnecessarily accurate result for the denominator in ( [ i ] ) . in practice one can live with fewer event pairs for event mixing , by replacing in ( [ 36 ] ) the number @xmath124 by a much smaller number @xmath135 . as long as @xmath136 one can still ensure that the contribution of the denominator to the statistical error of the final correlation function is negligible @xcite .",
    "the correlator @xmath27 differs from @xmath26 only by the different normalization .",
    "it can be constructed by taking the ratio of the following two expressions @xcite : @xmath137 @xmath138 and @xmath139 are the total numbers of `` correlated '' and `` uncorrelated '' pion pairs , respectively : @xmath140",
    "we have shown that in principle the normalization of the two - particle bose - einstein correlation function contains valuable information on the the multiplicity distribution of the event ensemble .",
    "both theoretically and experimentally the absolute normalization of the correlation function should thus be controlled as well as possible .",
    "we presented a variant of a previously suggested experimental algorithm @xcite for the construction of the correlator which guarantees correctly normalized correlators . within a specific model class of event ensembles which recently received extensive theoretical attention we showed that in systems with large pion phase - space densities multi - pion symmetrization effects can lead to interesting measurable effects on the normalization of the correlator .",
    "we suggest a careful study of this normalization as an alternate method for searching for strong multi - pion symmetrization effects in high - multiplicity hadronic and heavy - ion collisions .",
