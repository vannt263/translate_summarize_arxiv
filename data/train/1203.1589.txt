    "the xenon100 @xcite experiment was built to search for interactions of massive , cold dark matter particles in liquid xenon .",
    "the motivation for this search comes from our current understanding of the universe .",
    "cosmological observations ranging from the measured abundance of primordial elements to the precise mapping of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background , to the study of the distribution of matter on galactic , extragalactic and the largest observed scales , to observations of high - redshift supernovae , have led to a so - called standard model of cosmology . in this model ,",
    "our universe is spatially flat and composed of @xmath44% atoms , @xmath423% dark matter and @xmath473% dark energy @xcite .",
    "understanding the nature of dark matter poses a significant challenge to astroparticle physics , for its solution may involve new particles with masses and cross sections characteristic of the electroweak scale .",
    "such weakly interactive massive particles ( wimps ) , which would have been in thermal equilibrium with quarks and leptons in the hot early universe , and decoupled when they were non - relativistic , represent a generic class of dark matter candidates  @xcite .",
    "concrete examples are the lightest superpartner in supersymmetry with r - parity conservation @xcite , and the lightest kaluza - klein particle , for instance the first excitation of the hypercharge gauge boson , in theories with universal extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the wimp hypothesis is the fact that it is testable by experiment .",
    "wimps with masses around the tev scale are within reach of high - energy colliders and of direct and indirect dark matter detection experiments @xcite .",
    "dark matter particles might be detected via their elastic collisions with atomic nuclei in earthbound , low - background detectors @xcite .",
    "the differential rate for elastic scattering can be expressed as @xcite :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the number of target nuclei , @xmath7 is the local dark matter density in the galactic halo , @xmath8 is the wimp mass , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the wimp velocity and velocity distribution function in the earth frame and @xmath11 is the wimp - nucleus differential cross section .",
    "the nuclear recoil energy is @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the scattering angle in the center - of - mass frame , @xmath14 is the nuclear mass and @xmath15 is the reduced mass . the minimum velocity is defined as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the energy threshold of the detector , and @xmath18 is the escape velocity in the earth frame .",
    "the simplest galactic model assumes a maxwell - boltzmann distribution for the wimp velocity in the galactic rest frame , with a velocity dispersion of @xmath19 270kms@xmath20 and an escape velocity of v@xmath21 544kms@xmath20 . for direct detection experiments ,",
    "the mass density and velocity distribution at a radius around 8kpc are most relevant .",
    "high - resolution , dark - matter - only simulations of milky way - like halos find that the dark matter mass distribution at the solar position is smooth , with substructures being far away from the sun . the local velocity distribution of dark matter particles is likewise found to be smooth , and close to maxwellian @xcite .",
    "recent simulation of hierarchical structure formation including the effect of baryons revealed that a thick dark matter disk forms in galaxies , along with the dark matter halo @xcite .",
    "the dark disk has a density of @xmath22 = 0.25@xmath231.5 where the standard halo density is @xmath7=0.3gev@xmath24 and the kinematics are predicted to follow the milky way s stellar thick disk .",
    "at the solar neighborhood , this yields a rotation lag of v@xmath25=40@xmath2350km / s with respect to the local circular velocity , and a dispersion of @xmath2640@xmath2360km / s .",
    "these velocities are significantly lower than in the standard halo model and have implications for the expected rates in direct @xcite and indirect @xcite dark matter detection experiments .",
    "the differential cross section for elastic scattering has two separate components : an effective scalar coupling between the wimp and the mass of the nucleus and an effective coupling between the spin of the wimp and the total angular momentum of the nucleus . in general , the coherent part dominates the interaction ( depending however on the characteristics and composition of the dark matter particle ) for target masses with a@xmath2730 @xcite . the total cross section is the sum of both contributions @xmath28 , where @xmath29 are the spin - independent ( si ) and spin - dependent ( sd ) cross sections in the limit of zero momentum transfer and @xmath30 denote the nuclear form factors , expressed as a function of the recoil energy .",
    "these become significant at large wimp and nucleus masses , leading to a suppression of the differential scattering rate at higher recoil energies .    a dark matter particle with a mass in the gev@xmath23tev range",
    "has a momentum of a few tens to a few hundred mev and an energy below 100kev is transferred to a nucleus in a terrestrial detector .",
    "expected event rates range from one to less than 10@xmath31 events per kg detector material and year . to observe a wimp - induced spectrum , a low energy threshold , an ultra - low background noise and a large target mass are essential . in a given detector ,",
    "the kinetic energy carried by the scattered nucleus is transformed into a measurable signal , such as ionization , scintillation light or phonons .",
    "the simultaneous detection of two observables yields a powerful discrimination against background events , which are mostly interactions with electrons , as opposed to wimps and neutrons , which scatter off nuclei .",
    "given the size and rate of a potential dark matter signal , an absolute low background is equally relevant .",
    "it implies high material selection of detector components and specific active and passive shields against the natural radioactivity of the environment and against cosmic rays and secondary particles produced in their interactions .",
    "highly granular detectors and/or good timing and position resolution will distinguish localized energy depositions from multiple scatters within the active detector volume and in addition allow to intrinsically measure the neutron background .",
    "finally , the position resolution leads to the identification of events clustered at the detector surfaces or elsewhere , which are quite unlikely to be induced by wimp interactions .",
    "liquid xenon has ideal properties as a dark matter target and is used to build massive , homogeneous and position - sensitive wimp detectors .",
    "it has a high scintillation ( @xmath32 = 178 nm ) and ionization yield because of its low ionization potential of 12.13ev @xcite .",
    "scintillation is produced by the formation and radiative decay of so - called excimers , xe@xmath33 , which are bound ion - atom states . due to the deexcitation of the singlet and triplet states of the excited dimers , the scintillation decay times",
    "have a fast ( @xmath44.2ns ) and a slow ( @xmath422ns ) component .",
    "although the intensity ratio of the singlet to triplet state depends on the deposited energy density , the effect is difficult to exploit in practice , in particular at low recoil energies , because of the similar involved time scaless , respectively . ] .",
    "if an electric field around 1kv / cm is applied , ionization electrons can also be detected , either directly or through the secondary process of proportional scintillation .",
    "the interaction of a wimp results in a low - energy nuclear recoil , which loses its energy generating charge carriers and scintillation photons .",
    "both signals are suppressed when compared to an electronic recoil of the same initial energy , but by different amounts , allowing to use their ratio to distinguish between electronic and nuclear recoils .",
    "the ionization and scintillation yields , defined as the number of produced electron - ion pairs and photons per unit of absorbed energy , depend on the drift field and on the energy of the recoil and must be known precisely down to low energies . for electronic recoils , measurements and predictions for",
    "the light yield exist down to 5kev @xcite , while for nuclear recoils the light and charge yield were measured directly down to 3kev @xcite and 4kev @xcite , respectively .",
    "natural xenon does not contain long - lived radioactive isotopes apart from the double beta emitter @xmath34xe , which has a half - life of 2.1@xmath3510@xmath36yr @xcite .",
    "the trace content of @xmath37kr , a beta emitter with an endpoint of 687kev and a half - life of 10.76 years , has to be separated to a level of 10@xmath38 mol / mol ( @xmath39kr / xe ) for a ton - scale experiment .",
    "it is achieved by distillation @xcite , which exploits the different boiling points of krypton ( 120k ) and xenon ( 165k ) at 1 atmosphere , or by adsorption - based chromatography @xcite .",
    "these tiny krypton concentrations in xenon gas can be observed with the mass spectrometry technique @xcite , which in the future might also be used to monitor the krypton levels in a dark matter detector .",
    "the high mass of the xenon nucleus is favorable for scalar interactions and the presence of two isotopes with unpaired neutrons ( @xmath40xe : spin-1/2 , 26.4% and @xmath41xe : spin-3/2 , 21.2% ) ensures sensitivity to axial wimp - nuclei couplings .",
    "the high density ( 3g/@xmath42 ) and high atomic number ( z=54 , a=131.3 ) allow to build self - shielding , compact dark matter detectors .",
    "xenon is a phased approach to dark matter direct detection with time projection chambers ( tpcs ) at the 10 kg , 100 kg and 1000 kg fiducial target mass scale .",
    "an interaction within the active volume of the detector will create ionization electrons and prompt scintillation photons , and both signals are detected .",
    "the electrons drift in the pure liquid under an external electric field , are accelerated by a stronger field and extracted into the vapour phase above the liquid , where they generate proportional scintillation , or electroluminiscence .",
    "two arrays of photomultiplier tubes , one in the liquid and one in the gas , detect the prompt scintillation ( s1 ) and the delayed proportional scintillation signal ( s2 ) .",
    "the array immersed in the liquid collects the majority of the prompt signal , which is totally reflected at the liquid - gas interface .",
    "the ratio of the two signals is different for nuclear recoils created by wimp or neutron interactions , and electronic recoils produced by @xmath43 and @xmath44-rays , providing the basis for background discrimination . since electron diffusion in the ultra - pure liquid xenon is small , the proportional scintillation photons carry the @xmath45 information of the interaction site . with the @xmath46information from the drift time measurement ,",
    "the tpc yields a three - dimensional event localization , enabling to reject the majority of the background via fiducial volume cuts . to test the concept and verify the achievable energy threshold , background rejection and dark matter sensitivity , a detector with a fiducial mass on the order of 10 kg ( xenon10 ) @xcite , was developed and operated at the gran sasso national laboratory ( lngs ) .",
    "xenon10 excluded previously unexplored parameter space , setting 90% c.l .",
    "upper limits of @xmath47 and @xmath48 on the wimp - nucleon spin - independent and spin - dependent cross - sections , respectively , at a wimp mass of 30  gev/@xmath49 @xcite .",
    "it found no evidence for light ( @xmath5010gev ) dark matter particles with scattering cross sections above 10@xmath51@xmath52 @xcite . the next step in this program",
    ", the xenon100 detector @xcite , is taking data at lngs since 2008 .",
    "i will briefly describe the experiment and its recent results in the following sections .",
    "xenon1 t , with a total liquid xenon mass of 2.4tons , is approved to be built in hall b at lngs , in a 9.6 m diameter and 10 m height water cherenkov shield @xcite .",
    "construction will start in late 2012 .",
    "finally , darwin @xcite is a design study for an `` ultimate '' noble liquid dark matter experiment , aiming to probe cross sections down to 10@xmath53@xmath54 and to measure wimp - induced nuclear recoil spectra with high - statistics , should they be discovered by an existing or near - future experiment .",
    "the goal is to determine or at least constrain wimp properties , such as its mass , scattering cross section and possibly spin @xcite .",
    "xenon100 is a 161 kg double - phase xenon tpc operated at lngs in an improved xenon10 shield @xcite .",
    "a total of 242 low - radioactivity , uv - sensitive photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) detect the prompt and proportional light signals induced by particles interacting in the sensitive volume , containing 62 kg of ultra - pure liquid xenon .",
    "the remaining 99 kg act as an active veto shield mostly against multiple compton scatters .",
    "while the fiducial mass of xenon100 has been increased by a factor of 10 with respect to xenon10 , its background is lower by a factor of 100 @xcite .",
    "this remarkable reduction was achieved through screening and selection of ultra - low background materials for the detector and shield construction @xcite , by placing the cryogenic system along with its cryocooler and the high - voltage feedthroughs outside of the shield , by taking advantage of the self - shielding power of xenon and of the active xenon shield , by purifying the xenon for the radioactive @xmath37kr with a dedicated distillation column operated underground , and by adding @xmath45 cm of electrolytic copper and 20 cm of water inside and outside of the existing shield , respectively .",
    "the design of the xenon100 detector and present performance results are detailed in @xcite .",
    "the time projection chamber is close to cylindrical in shape , with 30.6 cm in diameter and 30.5 cm in height .",
    "its walls are made of 24 interlocking polytetrafluorethylen ( teflon ) panels , which work as insulators and are good reflectors for the xenon scintillation light  @xcite .",
    "the electrical fields are created with thin metal meshes that were etched with a hexagonal pattern from stainless steel foils and spot - welded onto low - radioactivity , stainless steel rings .",
    "the cathode mesh , which is 75@xmath55 m thick and has a pitch of 5 mm , is biased with 16kv , generating a drift field of 0.53kv / cm across the tpc .",
    "about 5 mm below the top pmt array , the tpc is closed with a stack of three meshes : a central anode , 125@xmath55 m thick and 2.5 mm pitch is placed between two grounded meshes with a spacing of 5 mm .",
    "an electron extraction field of @xmath412kv / cm is obtained by applying @xmath564.5kv to the anode .",
    "the field is sufficiently high to obtain an electron extraction efficiency close to 100%  @xcite .",
    "averaged over all angles of incidence , the optical transparency of the top mesh stack and of cathode plus an additional screening mesh below the cathode is 47.7% and 83.4% , respectively .",
    "a homogeneous electric field across the drift region is created by 40  equidistant field shaping electrodes , connected through 700m@xmath57 resistors .",
    "two arrays of hamamatsu r8520 - 06-al 1-inch square pmts with synthetic quartz windows and selected for low radioactivity in @xmath58u/@xmath59th/@xmath60k/@xmath61co/@xmath62cs  @xcite , detect the vuv scintillation light : 98 tubes are located in the vapour phase above the liquid target , arranged in concentric circles to optimize the spatial resolution of radial event - position reconstruction .",
    "while these tubes mostly see the s2 light signal , the energy threshold of the detector is determined by the much smaller s1 signal .",
    "because of the 1.7 refractive index of lxe @xcite and the resulting internal reflection at the liquid - gas interface , about 80% of the s1  signal is seen by a second pmt array immersed in the liquid below the cathode .",
    "these 80 tubes have higher quantum efficiencies compared to the ones on top , and are arranged in a closed - packed geometry , yielding optimal area coverage for efficient s1 light collection .    the tpc is enclosed in a double - walled , low - radioactivity stainless steel cryostat @xcite .",
    "the detector is cooled remotely and the connection to the outside of the shield is established via three stainless steel pipes , one to the cooling system , two to the pmt feedthroughs and pumping ports . to bias the cathode and the anode , custom - made hermetic high - voltage feedthroughs , composed of a stainless steel core enclosed by a teflon insulation layer ,",
    "are used . a liquid xenon layer of 4 cm thickness surrounds the tpc and is observed by 64  pmts .",
    "the active veto is used to reject multiple - scatter events occurring within a time window of @xmath6320  ns , and is most effective in reducing the background from compton scatters @xcite .",
    "it is optically separated from the tpc by the interlocking teflon panels , reducing the event rate in the dark matter target and the rate of accidental coincidences to a negligible level .",
    "a drawing of the detector and a schematic view in its low - background shield are shown in figure [ fig::xe100schematics ] .",
    "to characterize the detector performance and its stability in time , calibration sources are regularly inserted in the xenon100 shield through a copper tube surrounding the cryostat ( visible in figure [ fig::xe100schematics ] , right ) . the electronic recoil band in @xmath64 versus energy space defines the region of background events from @xmath43- and @xmath44-particles .",
    "it is measured using the low - energy compton tail from @xmath61co and @xmath59th calibration sources .",
    "the detector response to single - scatter nuclear recoils , the expected signature of a dark matter particle , is measured with an ambe @xmath65-source . besides the definition of the nuclear recoil band in @xmath64 and thus of the included wimp - search region , the calibration yields gamma lines from inelastic neutron collisions , as well as from the de - excitation of xenon or fluorine ( in the teflon ) isomers , activated by neutron capture : 40kev from @xmath40xe , 80kev from @xmath41xe , 110kev from @xmath66f , 164kev from @xmath67xe ( t@xmath68=11.8d ) , 197kev from @xmath66f , and 236kev from @xmath69xe ( t@xmath68=8.9d ) .",
    "the ionization and scintillation signals are anti - correlated for interactions in lxe @xcite . the fluctuations in the sum signal are lower than in each individual signal , leading to an improved energy resolution . in xenon100 ,",

    "this angle has been determined for energies from 40kev to 1333kev : it is roughly constant for energies down to @xmath4100kev and decreases at lower energies .",
    "the angles at 40kev and 80kev are smaller , since the observed energy deposition is a combination from a nuclear recoil and a subsequent , prompt gamma emission . from the mean positions and angles , the so - called combined energy scale for electronic recoils",
