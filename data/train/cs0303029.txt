    "faloutsos  _ et  al _ @xcite discovered that the internet topology at the autonomous systems ( ases ) level ( as graph ) has a power  law degree distribution , @xmath0 , where node degree @xmath1 is the number of links a node has .",
    "subramanian  _ et  al _ @xcite , using a heuristic argument based on the commercial relationship between ases , found that the internet has a tier structure .",
    "tier 1 consists of a ` core ' of ases which are well connected to each other .",
    "recently the rich  club phenomenon @xcite was introduced as a quantitative metric to characterize the core tier without making any heuristic assumption on the interaction between network elements .",
    "there are a number of internet power ",
    "law topology generators , some are degree - based and others are structure - based .",
    "tangmunarunkit  _ et al _ @xcite found that degree distributions produced by structure - based generators are not power  laws .    in this paper",
    "we introduce the interactive growth ( ig ) model based on the joint growth of new nodes and new links .",
    "we compare the as graph against the ig model and three degree - based models , which are the barabsi and albert ( ba ) scale  free model @xcite , the inet3.0 model @xcite and the generalized linear preference ( glp ) model @xcite .",
    "we show that the ig model compares favorable with other internet power ",
    "law topology generators because it not only closely resembles the degree distribution of the as graph , but also accurately matches the hierarchical structure measured by the rich - club phenomenon .",
    "the ig model is simple and dynamic , we believe it is a good step towards modelling the internet topology .",
    "power  law topologies have a small number of nodes having large numbers of links .",
    "we call these nodes ` rich nodes ' .",
    "the as graph shows a rich  club phenomenon @xcite , in which rich nodes are very well connected to each other and rich nodes are connected preferentially to the other rich nodes .",
    "recently the rich  club phenomenon was measured @xcite in the so  called original  maps and extended  maps of the as graph .",
    "the original  maps are based on the bgp routing tables collected by the university of oregon route views project @xcite . the extended ",
    "maps @xcite use additional data sources , such as the looking glass ( lg ) data and the internet routing registry ( irr ) data .",
    "the two maps have similar numbers of nodes , while the extended  maps have @xmath2 more links than the original  maps .",
    "the research showed the majority of the missing links in the original  maps are connecting links _ between _ rich nodes of the extended  maps , and therefore , the extended  maps show the rich  club phenomenon significantly stronger than the original  maps .",
    "the rich - club phenomenon is relevant because the connectivity between rich nodes can be crucial for network properties , such as network routing efficiency , redundancy and robustness .",
    "for example in the as graph , the members of the rich - club are very well connected to each other .",
    "this means that there are a large number of alternative routing paths between the club members where the average path length inside the club is very small ( 1 to 2 hops ) .",
    "hence , the rich - club acts as a super traffic hub and provides a large selection of shortcuts .",
    "network models without the rich - club phenomenon may under  estimate the efficiency and flexibility of the traffic routing in the as graph . on the other hand , models without the rich - club phenomenon may over  estimate the robustness of the network to a node attack @xcite where the removal of a few of its richest club members can break down the network integrity .",
    "the rich  club phenomenon is a quantitatively simple way to differentiate the tier structures between power ",
    "law topologies and it provides a criterion for new network models .",
    "the inet3.0 model @xcite was designed to match the measurements of the original  maps of the as graph .",
    "the model is capable of creating networks with degree distribution similar to that of the measurements .",
    "the number of links generated by the model depends on two parameters , which are the total number of nodes and the percentage of nodes with degree one .",
    "the model typically generates 26% less links than the extended  as graph .",
    "the ba model @xcite shows that a power  law degree distribution can arise from two generic mechanisms : 1 ) _ growth _ , where networks expand continuously by the addition of new nodes , and 2 ) _ preferential attachment _ , where new nodes are attached preferentially to nodes that are already well connected .",
    "the probability @xmath3 that a new node will be connected to node @xmath4 is proportional to @xmath5 , the degree of node @xmath4 .",
    "+ @xmath6    using the mean  field theory , barabsi  _ et  al _ @xcite estimated that the ba model generates networks with degree distribution of @xmath7 .",
    "this model has generated great interests in various research areas and has been used as a starting point in the research of error and attack tolerance of the internet @xcite .",
    "the glp model @xcite was recently introduced .",
    "this model is a modification of the ba model .",
    "it reflects the fact that the evolution of the as graph is mostly due to two operations , the addition of new nodes and the addition of new links between existing nodes .",
    "it starts with @xmath8 nodes connected through @xmath9 links .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : glp ] , at each time  step , one of the following two operations is performed : 1 ) with probability @xmath10 , m < m_0 $ ] new links are added between @xmath11 pairs of nodes chosen from existing nodes , and 2 ) with probability @xmath12 , one new node is added and connected to @xmath11 existing nodes .",
    "the glp model uses the generalized linear preference that the probability @xmath3 to choose node @xmath4 is @xmath13 where the parameter @xmath14 can be adjusted such that nodes have a stronger preference of being connected to high degree nodes than predicted by the linear preference of the ba model ( equation  [ eq : ba ] ) .",
    "this model matches the as graph ( original  maps measured in sept . 2000 ) in terms of the two characteristic properties of small  world networks @xcite , which are the characteristic path length and the clustering coefficient .",
    "the interactive growth ( ig ) model also reflects the two main operations that account for the evolution of the as graph , the addition of new nodes and the addition of new links . however the growth of links and nodes are inter - dependant in the ig model .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : ig ] , at each time  step , a new node is connected to existing nodes ( host nodes ) , and new links will connect the host nodes to other existing nodes ( peer nodes ) .",
    "the ig model uses the same linear preference as the ba model ( equation  [ eq : ba ] ) when choosing existing nodes to connect with .    in the actual internet ,",
    "new nodes bring new traffic load to its host nodes .",
    "this results in both the increase of traffic volume and the change of traffic pattern around host nodes and triggers the addition of new links connecting host nodes to peer nodes in order to balance network traffic and optimize network performance .",
    "we call the joint growth of new nodes and new links the interactive growth ( ig ) .    the joint growth of new nodes and new links has two significant impacts , 1 ) rich nodes of the ig model are better inter - connected to each other than those of the ba model ; and 2 ) rich nodes of the ig model have higher degrees than those of the ba model .",
    "figure  [ fig : ig2 ] shows that the time ",
    "evolution of node degree in both the ba model and the ig model obeys a power ",
    "law @xmath15 .",
    "as predicted by barabsi  _ et  al _ @xcite , @xmath16 of the ba model is @xmath17 .",
    "our calculation shows that @xmath16 of the ig model is @xmath18 .",
    "this means that node degree in the ig model increases at a higher rate than in the ba model .",
    "the reason is that during the interactive growth of the ig model , host nodes not only connect to new nodes but also acquire new links connecting to peer nodes .",
    "as shown in table  [ table:1 ] , we generate 5 networks using the above four models with the same number of nodes as the as graph , which in this paper is an extended  map measured on 26th may , 2001 .",
    ".network properties [ cols=\"^,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      + @xmath19  total number of links ; + @xmath20  number of links connecting _ with _ the top 5% rich nodes ; + @xmath21  number of links connecting _ between _ the top 5% rich nodes .",
    "table  [ table:2 ] shows that the majority of links are the links connecting with the top @xmath22 rich node , @xmath20 .",
    "figure  [ fig : linkdistribution ] illustrates more details by plotting @xmath23 against corresponding node rank @xmath24 , where @xmath24 is divided into @xmath22 bins .    the as graph shows a rich  club phenomenon , in which rich nodes are connected preferentially to the other rich nodes .",
    "the number of links connecting between the top @xmath22 rich nodes ( @xmath25 ) is significantly larger than the number of links connecting these rich nodes to other lower degree nodes .",
    "the inet3.0 model does not show this phenomenon as strong as the as graph .",
    "the ba model does not show this phenomenon at all , in stead , rich nodes are connected to nodes of all degrees with similar probabilities . on the contrary ,",
    "the two glp models show this phenomenon significantly stronger than the as graph . in the glp model(1 ) , @xmath26 is nearly twice of that of the as graph .",
    "as seen from figure  [ fig : connectivity ] , table  [ table:2 ] and figure  [ fig : linkdistribution ] , only the ig model accurately reproduce the rich  club phenomenon of the as graph .",
    "the inet3.0 model is not a dynamic model .",
    "although it well resembles the degree distribution , the model generates networks with typically 26% less links than the extended  as graph .",
    "figure  [ fig : linkdistribution ] shows that the majority of the missing links are connecting links between the rich nodes of the as graph . as a result , the inet-3.0 model does not show the rich - club phenomenon as strong as the as graph .",
    "the ba model generates a strict power  law degree distribution , which is very different from that of the actual as graph .",
    "moreover , it does not show the rich  club phenomenon of the as graph at all .",
    "this means that the network structure of the ba model is fundamentally different from that of the as graph .",
    "the reason for this is that , according to the dynamics of the ba model , all new links connect with new nodes . due to the preferential attachment , the probability for a new node to become a rich node decreases as the network grows",
    "this means that the number of links between rich nodes rarely increases after the initial growth . as a result ,",
    "rich nodes are not well connected to each other , and in the end , they are connected to nodes of all degrees with similar probabilities .",
    "this result agrees with the study of chen  _ et al _ @xcite which showed that from the available historical data , the as graph does not evolves as the dynamics assumed in the ba model .    the glp model does not reproduce the details of the degree distribution of the as graph .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the rich  club phenomenon obtained from the glp model is significantly stronger than the as graph .",
    "tangmunarunkit  _ et al _ @xcite suggested that degree - based network topology generators can match the degree distribution and the hierarchy in real networks .",
    "our results show that the degree - based models can generate networks with significantly different tier structures measured by the rich - club phenomenon .",
    "the ig model compares favorable with other internet power - law topology generators .",
    "it not only closely resembles the degree distribution of the as graph , but also accurately matches the hierarchical structure of the as graph .",
    "the ig model is a simple and dynamic model .",
    "the topological properties of the networks generated by the model are given by its joint growth of new nodes and new links .",
    "it is possible to include other parameters in the ig model , such as bandwidth and delay .",
    "we expect the model to be used in simulation - based research for the internet traffic engineering .",
    "we believe that the ig model is a good step towards modelling the internet topology ."
