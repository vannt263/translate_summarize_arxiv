    "by definition a wormhole ( wh ) is a bridge connecting two asymptotically flat regions .",
    "usually such construction is a classical object and should satisfy to einstein equations ( see @xcite for more detailed introduction to this field ) .",
    "the topology of the 4d wh is @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the time , @xmath3 is the radial coordinate and @xmath4 is the cross section of the wh .",
    "a space region near to the minimal cross section @xmath5 is called as a throat .",
    "the basic problem for existing of the wh is concentrated on the throat : in this region a matter violates the so - called null energy condition . in this paper",
    "we offer a model of the wh in which the throat is _ a set of quantum handles ( wormholes ) in the presence of the strong electric field_. these quantum handles can be considered as quantum wh s of a spacetime foam with separated mouthes ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "we remind that the hypothesized spacetime foam @xcite , @xcite is a set of quantum wormholes ( handles ) appearing in the spacetime on the planck scale level ( @xmath6 ) . for the macroscopic observer",
    "these quantum fluctuations are smoothed and we have an ordinary smooth manifold with the metric submitting to einstein equations .",
    "the presence of the spacetime foam with virtual wormholes ( vwh ) which have separated mouthes gives a physical effect : vwh s can entrap a part of the electric flux lines and in spite of the fact that at the infinity @xmath0 we will have a non - singular spacetime ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the charge and mass registered at the infinity ) .",
    "the mechanism for creating the wh with quantum throat can be offered by the following way :    1 .   the vwh s connect two regions with the strong electric field by such a way that the electric flux lines leak through vwh s from one region to another one @xcite , see fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "each vwh is the solutions of the 5d einstein equations with @xmath9 .",
    "3 .   as usually the @xmath10 metric component can be considered as the 4d electric field which joins the electric flux lines of the above - mentioned two 4d regions .",
    "4 .   for this model",
    "the whole spacetime is 5d one and outside of the throat the @xmath11 is non - dynamical variable and we have the 5d kaluza - klein theory in its initial interpretation ( @xmath12 and 5d gravity is equivalent to einstein - maxwell theory ) , inside of the throat the @xmath11 is dynamical variable and we have the ordinary kaluza - klein gravity with 4d metric + electromagnetic and scalar fields .",
    "splitting off the 5d dimension takes place on the event horizon .",
    "the matching conditions of the 4d and 5d fields on the event horizon is discussed in ref.@xcite . as",
    "this composite wh is the classical solution of the 5d kaluza - klein equations a probability for the quantum creation of such vwh is not zero .",
    "the model of the vwh is presented on the fig.([fig2 ] ) .    on the fig.([fig3 ] ) are presented the two parts of the wh with the quantum throat .    on the fig.[fig3]a",
    "is presented the part of the wh with incoming force lines of the electric field and respectively on the fig.[fig3]b the part with outcoming force lines . for the 4d observer",
    "each mouth is like to moving ( + /-",
    ") electric charge .",
    "but this movement is stochastic one and as a consequence we have @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the stochastical averaging .    in ref.@xcite",
    "is shown that such composite wh has a spin - like structure .",
    "the cause of this is following .",
    "the metric describing the 5d throat is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the 5@xmath18 extra coordinate ; @xmath19 , @xmath20 ; @xmath21 are the @xmath22 polar coordinates ; here @xmath23 and @xmath24 are some constants .",
    "we see that the signs of the @xmath25 and @xmath26 are not defined .",
    "we remark that this 5d metric is located behind the event horizon therefore the 4d observer is not able to determine the signs of the @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xcite . moreover",
    "this 5d metric ( [ ql1 ] ) can fluctuate between these two possibilities .",
    "hence the external 4d observer is forced to describe such composite wh by means of a spinor .",
    "this allows us to do the following assumption :    the stochastical polarized spacetime foam approximately can be determinated by some effective field : a spinor field @xmath27 .    in this case",
    "a density @xmath28 of the vwh is @xmath29 where ( @xmath30 ) means the transposition and a density of an effective electric charge @xmath31 ( the mouthes of vwh entrapped the electric force lines ) is @xmath32 where @xmath7 is some charge .",
    "as the hypothesized spacetime foam is a consequence of quantum gravity all our fields ( metric @xmath33 , electromagnetic filed @xmath34 and spinor field @xmath27 ) in this model should be quantized fields .",
    "the interaction between these fields is very strong and we can not use the feynmann diagram technique . for the quantization of this model we will use the heisenberg quantization method which he applied for the non - linear spinor field @xcite .",
    "the essence of this method consists in that the classical fields @xmath35 in field equations are excanched on the field operators @xmath36 . in this case",
    "we have differential equations for operators .",
    "certainly it is not clear what is a solution of such differential equations .",
    "in fact heisenberg has shown that differential equations for the operator field is equivalent to some infinite set of differential equations for green functions ( for the small coupling constant this is dayson - schwinger equations system ) .    following this way we write differential equations for the gravitational + electromagnetic fields in the presence of the spacetime foam @xmath37 as follows @xmath38 } - m \\right ) \\hat\\psi & = & 0 , \\label{ex2}\\\\ d_\\nu \\hat f^{\\mu\\nu } & = & 4\\pi e \\left ( \\hat{\\bar\\psi}\\hat\\gamma^\\mu \\hat \\psi \\right ) \\label{ex3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the operator of ricci tensor ; @xmath40 is the operator of the sum of the energy - momentum tensor the spinor and maxwell fields ; @xmath41 is the operator of the gravitational field ; @xmath42 is the operator of the dirac matrices ; @xmath43 , @xmath44 $ ] means the antisymmetrization ; @xmath45 ( @xmath46 is the vier - bein index ) is the usual @xmath47-matrices @xmath48 where @xmath49 are the pauli matrices ; @xmath50 is the vier - bein operator ; greek indexes are the spacetime indexes ; latin indexes with the bar are vier - bein indexes ; @xmath51 is the operator of the maxwell tensor of the electromagnetic field ; @xmath52 is the operator of the potential ; @xmath8 and @xmath7 are some constants",
    ". certainly this equation system is hopelessly complicated , and are impossible to find exact solutions .",
    "we will consider equations for average values @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and so on .",
    "in the first approximation we suppose that @xmath56 where @xmath57 can be @xmath39 , @xmath58 and so on ; @xmath59 can be @xmath41 , @xmath60 , @xmath52 and so on . in this case",
    "we have the classical system of the einstein - dirac - maxwell equations , _",
    "i.e. _ now the system ( [ ex1])-([ex3 ] ) is without ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "fot our model we use the following ansatz : for the spherically symmetric metric @xmath62 for the electromagnetic potential @xmath63 for the spinor field @xmath64 the following is _ very important _ for us : the ansatz ( [ ex8 ] ) for the spinor field @xmath27 has the @xmath65 component of the energy - momentum tensor and the @xmath66 component of the current .",
    "let we remind that @xmath27 determines the stochastical gas of the vwh s which can not have a preferred direction in the spacetime .",
    "this means that after substitution expression ( [ ex6])-([ex8 ] ) into field equations they should be averaged by the spin direction of the ansatz ( [ ex8 ] ) in the expression ( [ ex5 ] ) is not only quantum but stochastical , too . ] .",
    "after this averaging we have @xmath67 and @xmath68 and we have the following equations system describing our spherically symmetric spacetime @xmath69 where @xmath70 is some constant .",
    "this equations system was investigated in @xcite and result is the following . a particle - like solution exists which has the following expansions near @xmath71 @xmath72 and the following asymptotical behaviour @xmath73 where @xmath74 is",
    "the mass for the observer at infinity and @xmath75 is the charge of this solution .",
    "our interpretation of this solution is presented on the fig.([fig4 ] ) .",
    "the solution exists for @xmath76 and @xmath77 but for us is essential the first case with @xmath76 . in this case",
    "the classical einstein - maxwell theory leads to the `` naked '' singularity .",
    "the presence of the spacetime foam drastically changes this result : _ the appearance of the vwh s can prevent the formation of the `` naked '' singularuty in the reissner - nordstrm solution with @xmath0_.",
    "thus our model is based on the following assumptions :    * in basic the quantum ( virtual ) whs of the spacetime foam have the 5d throat . *",
    "each quantum wh has a spin - like structure , * the spacetime foam effectively can be described with the help of a spinor field .    as the consequence we have the result that the strong electric field separates the vwh s of the spacetime foam by such a way that they can prevent a singularity in the reissner - nordstrm solution ( with @xmath78 ) on account of the formation of vwhs .    in the spirit of the einstein idea that the right - hand of gravitational equations should be zero we can note that this model of the wh with quantum throat is the vacuum model since the gauge fields can be considered as components of the metric in some multidimensional kaluza - klein gravity",
