    "the intrinsic josephson effect @xcite in strongly anisotropic high - temperature superconductors , such as bi@xmath3sr@xmath3cacu@xmath3o@xmath4 ( bscco ) , has been a subject of intense experimental study ( see review articles @xcite ) .",
    "stack of low - dissipative junctions formed by atomic layers represents a nonlinear system with unique dynamic properties .",
    "in particular , this system possesses a rich spectrum of the electromagnetic plasma waves .",
    "these waves can be excited via the josephson effect , which makes these materials convenient voltage - to - frequency converters and gives strong potential for practical applications .",
    "a magnetic field applied along the layers forms the lattice of josephson vortices .",
    "transport properties of this state are determined by the dynamics of the josephson vortex lattice .",
    "coherent motion of josephson vortices in bscco has been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the motion of the josephson lattice generates alternating electric fields and currents which are coupled to electromagnetic plasma waves .",
    "one can expect a strong resonance emission when the velocity of the lattice matches the velocity of the plasma wave @xcite . in a voltage - biased transport experiment",
    "this should be seen as a resonant enhancement of the transport current @xcite , while in a current - biased experiment the resonance should be seen as a voltage jump . in conventional long josephson junctions",
    "this effect is known as eck peak ( eck step ) @xcite ( see also recent article and references therein ) . however , in layered superconductors this effect has qualitatively new features .",
    "the velocity of a plasma wave propagating along the layers strongly depends on the wave vector along the @xmath5 direction . on the other hand ,",
    "the traveling josephson lattice is coupled only to the plasma modes with the wave vectors given by the reciprocal wave vectors of the lattice , i.e. , _ the wave vector of the resonant mode is determined by the structure of the josephson lattice _ @xcite .",
    "in early theoretical work @xcite it was assumed that the moving lattice preserves its static structure ( stretched triangular lattice ) and the resonant velocity of the lattice is determined by this structure .",
    "we will show that the lattice structure experiences a nontrivial evolution with increase of velocity .",
    "moreover , a regular lattice state always becomes unstable at a certain velocity .",
    "therefore , finding conditions for the resonance emission is a nontrivial problem .",
    "recent numerical studies @xcite revealed a very rich dynamic evolution of moving josephson structures , which includes regular as well as chaotic solutions .",
    "in this paper we analyze the dynamics of the josephson lattice at strong fields , in the regime of strongly overlapping vortices . in this regime josephson coupling",
    "can be treated perturbatively .",
    "this strongly facilitates the analytical analysis of the dynamic structures .",
    "major results have been already reported in the letter .",
    "a similar approach has been used to calculate resonant current - voltage dependencies in conventional long josephson junctions in magnetic field.@xcite this approach also describes josephson dynamics at arbitrary magnetic field when all junction are driven into resistive state by transport current .",
    "we will focus on the dynamics in the case of large size samples and will not consider resonances related to finite - size effect ( fiske resonances ) . the classification of fiske resonant frequencies for layered superconductors in the case of a moving rectangular lattice has been done by kleiner .",
    "@xcite the experimental observation of these modes has been reported by irie _ _ e__t .",
    "al.@xcite    the phase dynamics in layered superconductors is described by the coupled sine - gordon equations.@xcite two equivalent approaches have been used to derive these equations . in the first approach @xcite the layered superconductor is modeled as a multilayered s - i - s - i-   system and the parameters of the equations are expressed via the geometrical parameters and the bulk parameters of the superconducting material from which the superconducting layers are prepared .",
    "the second approach@xcite , more natural for atomically layered superconductors , is based on the lawrence - doniach model . in this approach",
    "the layers are treated as two - dimensional entities from the very beginning .",
    "we will use the second approach .",
    "the dynamic phase diagram strongly depends on dissipation mechanisms . moving josephson vortices",
    "generate both in - plane and out - of - plane electric fields which induce dissipative quasiparticle currents . usually",
    ", only dissipation due to the tunneling of quasiparticles between the layers is taken into account in consideration of the dynamics of the josephson vortices.@xcite however , in high - t@xmath0 superconductors the in - plane component of the quasiparticle conductivity @xmath6 is strongly enhanced in the superconducting state as compared to the normal conductivity due to the reduction of the phase space for scattering .",
    "this enhancement was observed in @xmath7 @xcite and in @xmath8   @xcite .",
    "the c - axis component , @xmath9 , monotonically decreases with temperature in the superconducting state.@xcite the anisotropy of dissipation @xmath10 becomes larger than the superconducting anisotropy @xmath11 ( here @xmath12 is the anisotropy of the london penetration depth ) .",
    "this leads to the dominance of the in - plane dissipation in the dynamics of the josephson lattice in a wide field range.@xcite    starting from the the coupled sine - gordon equations , we derive equations for the relative displacements between the moving josephson planar arrays in the layers ( or , equivalently , for the phase shifts between the josephson oscillations in the different layers ) .",
    "this allows us to reduce the original two - dimensional problem to an one - dimensional one .",
    "dynamic equations reveal two families of steady - state solutions : lattices with constant phase shifts between neighboring layers , starting from zero for a rectangular configurations to @xmath13 for a triangular configuration , and double - periodic lattices with the average phase shift @xmath14 .",
    "we analyze the stability of the regular lattices and show that they exhibit several kinds of instabilities including the long - wave length shear instability and the short - wave length instability with respect to alternating deformations . a specific lattice structure at given velocity is selected uniquely by boundary conditions .",
    "the numerical investigation shows that at small velocities the lattice experiences a smooth evolution of the structure with the phase shift between neighboring layers decreasing from @xmath13 at zero velocity to smaller values . at a certain velocity",
    "the lattice becomes unstable and the system switches into an oscillating or chaotic state . at even higher velocities",
    "the steady - state regular lattice is restored again .",
    "the phase shift for this rapidly moving lattice is smaller than @xmath14 and continues to decrease with increasing velocity , i.e. , the structure evolves smoothly towards a rectangular configurations .",
    "the current - voltage characteristic is non - monotonic in the region of the instabilities , which means that two different coherent steady - states coexist within a certain current range . within this current range",
    "the system can also be in the phase separated states , in which it is split into two ( or more ) domains moving with different velocities separated by a phase defect .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec - dyneq ]",
    "we derive the coupled dynamic equations for the in - plane fields and phase differences . in section [ sec - eqphsh ] we derive the dynamic equations for the relative displacements [ phase shifts ] between the josephson planar arrays in layers . in section [ sec - cohstst ]",

    "we consider boundary conditions for top and bottom boundaries , discuss the mechanism of structure selection by the boundaries , and numerically calculate the evolution of the lattice structure with increase of velocity .",
    "finally , in section [ sec - mulbr ] we discuss the mechanism of multiple branches in the current - voltage dependence due to the dynamic phase separation : spontaneous splitting of the system into the rapidly and slowly moving regions .",
    "the dynamics of the moving josephson lattice can be described by coupled equations for the phase differences and magnetic field .",
    "these equations can be derived from maxwell s equations expressing fields and currents in terms of the gauge invariant phase difference between the layers @xmath15 and the in - plane superconducting momentum @xmath16 ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",

    "this dynamics can also be influenced by the charging effects @xcite and the quasiparticle imbalance @xcite .",

    "@xmath50 denotes the discrete laplace operator , @xmath51 .    in certain special cases",
    "the quasiparticle conductivity can be directly related with the josephson current .",
