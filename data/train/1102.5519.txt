    "it is evident to all workers in these fields that the relationship between operator theory and the theory of analytic functions is the source of many deep results . in recent work @xcite of the author",
    "a transfer function , which is in fact a multi - analytic operator , has been introduced in the context of noncommutative markov chains .",
    "these can be thought of as toy models for interaction processes in quantum physics .",
    "the theory of multi - analytic operators , pioneered by popescu @xcite and others in the late 1980 s , has developed into a very successful generalization of the relationship mentioned above .",
    "hence it is natural to expect that noncommutative markov chains and their transfer functions open up a possibility to apply these tools in the study of models in quantum physics .",
    "this paper is the result of an effort to discover the common geometric underpinning which ties together these at first sight rather different settings .",
    "it is found in the tree - like structure of wandering subspaces of row isometries , more precisely : the transfer function describes the relative position of two such trees .",
    "this is worked out in section 1 below .",
    "one of the main results in section 1 is a geometric characterization of pairs of subspaces with a multi - analytic operator as their transfer function .",
    "with this work done we are in a position to discuss the existing applications in a new light which highlights common features . in section 2",
    "we give , from this point of view , an expository treatment of characteristic functions , both the well - known characteristic function of a contraction in the sense of sz.nagy and foias @xcite and the less well - known characteristic function of a lifting introduced by dey and gohm @xcite . in section 3",
    "we explain in the same short but expository style the transfer function of a noncommutative markov chain from @xcite and sketch a generalization which is natural in the setting of this paper .",
    "we hope and expect that this presentation is helpful for operator theorists to find their way into an area of potentially interesting applications .",

    "it is possible to handle the multi - variable case ( @xmath171 ) , first studied by popescu in @xcite , in a very similar way and the result , if expressed in the notation explained for corollary [ cor : transfer2 ] , is very similar : the transfer function associated to a row contraction @xmath172 is @xmath173 where @xmath174 . it is shown in ( @xcite , 5.4 ) that @xmath170 is characteristic in the sense of being a complete unitary invariant if @xmath168 is completely non - coisometric .",
    "it is further shown in ( @xcite , 5.3.3 ) that to get a complete unitary invariant in the class of completely non - unitary row contractions one can consider a characteristic pair @xmath175 where @xmath176 is a cuntz weight .",
    "but there are other possibilities to obtain a pair of wandering subspaces @xmath45 and @xmath58 with orthogonal @xmath20-past than the scheme explained in the previous example .",

    "now suppose further that @xmath177 is a subspace of @xmath46 which is @xmath178-invariant .",
    "then for any subspace @xmath58 satisfying @xmath179 it follows that @xmath45 and @xmath58 are a pair of wandering subspaces with orthogonal @xmath20-past .",

    "together with @xmath186 and theorem [ thm : transfer ] this establishes the claim .",
    "this situation occurs in the theory of characteristic functions for liftings ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . as this is less well known than the sz.nagy-foias theory in the previous example and the presentation in @xcite gives the general case @xmath187 using a different approach and a different notation we think it is instructive to work out explicitly some details of this transfer function in the case @xmath119 with the methods of this paper .    as in the previous subsection let @xmath161 be a contraction , @xmath188 , @xmath189 the minimal isometric dilation and we still have @xmath190 and @xmath191 . but now suppose that @xmath192 such that @xmath177 is invariant for @xmath193 , in other words @xmath168 is a block matrix @xmath194 with respect to @xmath192 .",

    "it is proved in @xcite ( in a slightly different language ) that if we have another unit vector @xmath255 such that @xmath256 ( we call these unit vectors _ vacuum vectors _ in this case ) then we obtain a pair of wandering subspaces @xmath45 and @xmath58 with orthogonal @xmath20-past for a row isometry @xmath68 , notation consistent with section 1 , as follows : @xmath257 i.e. , the latter subspace of @xmath2 is identified with @xmath46 .",
    "the row isometry @xmath68 on @xmath2 is of the form @xmath258 where @xmath259 is the number of elements in an orthonormal basis of @xmath238 .",
    "let @xmath260 be such an orthonormal basis of @xmath261 , fixed from now on .",
    "then for @xmath262 and @xmath263 @xmath264 note that @xmath265 is shifted to the right in the tensor product and appears as @xmath266 on the right hand side .",
    "it is immediate that @xmath68 is a row isometry .",
    "to get used to this definition the reader is invited to verify the formula @xmath267 where @xmath268 with @xmath269 and on the right hand side @xmath265 now appears as @xmath270 .",
    "it becomes clear that the properties of the repeated interaction are encoded into properties of the row isometry @xmath68 .",
    "+ finally we define the pair of embedded subspaces : @xmath271 @xmath272    from the specific form of the isometries @xmath41 it is easy to check that @xmath45 is wandering and that @xmath273 .",
    "the proof that @xmath58 is wandering can be found in @xcite or deduced from proposition [ prop : wandering ] below ( which covers a more general situation ) . from theorem [ thm : transfer ]",
    "we have an associated transfer function which can be made explicit as a multi - analytic kernel @xmath60 or as a ( contractive ) multi - analytic operator @xmath63 .",
    "it may be called a transfer function of the noncommutative markov process . with @xmath274 ( here",
    "we identify @xmath46 with @xmath275 ) we find the operators @xmath276 appearing in the system matrix @xmath153 to be related to the interaction @xmath235 by @xmath277 ( where we have to identify @xmath278 and @xmath20 for the last equation ) .",
    "it is further discussed in @xcite how for models in quantum physics these operators and the coefficients of the transfer function built from them can be interpreted , and it is shown that the transfer function can be used to study questions about observability and about scattering theory ( outgoing cuntz scattering systems @xcite and scattering theory for markov chains @xcite ) .",
    "let us finally indicate that the additional ideas introduced in this paper provide a flexible setting for generalizations .",
    "let us consider the situation above but without assuming the existence of vacuum vectors .",
    "with @xmath252 being an arbitrary unit vector we can easily check that @xmath45 as defined above is still a wandering subspace for @xmath68 .",
    "hence for an arbitrary subspace @xmath58 of @xmath279 we conclude , by theorem [ thm : transfer ] , that we have orthogonal @xmath20-past and there exists a corresponding transfer function corresponding to a multi - analytic kernel @xmath60 .",
    "when is @xmath58 wandering ?",
    "a sufficient criterion generalizing the situation with vacuum vectors is provided by the following    [ prop : wandering ] let @xmath177 be a subspace of @xmath46 such that @xmath280 .",
    "then any subspace @xmath281 is wandering .",
    "+ ( here we adapt the convention to omit a tensoring with @xmath282 in the notation . )",
    "let @xmath283 be any vector orthogonal to @xmath284 .",
    "our first observation is that for all @xmath54 the vectors @xmath285 are orthogonal to @xmath284 too . in fact , we can write @xmath286 where @xmath287 with @xmath288 and with @xmath263 orthogonal to @xmath289 and @xmath290 . using the specific form of @xmath41 it follows immediately that @xmath291 is orthogonal to @xmath284 and the same is also true for @xmath292 taking into account the assumption @xmath280 , in the form : @xmath293 is orthogonal to @xmath284 .",
    "the second observation is that for all @xmath54 the vectors @xmath285 are orthogonal to @xmath294 .",
    "as @xmath295 can be approximated by a finite sum @xmath296 with @xmath297 and @xmath298 we may assume for simplicity that @xmath295 is of this form .",
    "but then @xmath299 is orthogonal to @xmath300 and now an application of @xmath301 gives us the result .",
