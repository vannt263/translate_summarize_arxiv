    "recent studies , based on multi - wavelength photometry , have revealed that the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of all galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) so far explored ( piotto et al .",
    "2015 , hereafter paperi ) is made of distinct sequences of stars that can be traced continuously from the bottom of the main sequence ( ms ) up to the tip of the red giant branch ( rgb ) and through the horizontal branch ( hb ) and the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "these sequences stand in contrast to the traditional view of gcs as the best example of simple stellar populations , i.e.made of stars born all at the same time and with the same chemical composition , confirming previous findings of cn variations in ms and rgb stars ( cannon et al.1998 ; grundahl et al.1998 ; grundahl1999 ) .",

    "this dataset complements the existing f606w and f814w photometry from the advanced camera for survey ( go-10775 , sarajedini et al.2007 ; anderson et al.2008 ) and is specifically designed to map multiple stellar populations in gcs .",
    "ngc2808 is one of the most intriguing galactic gcs in the context of multiple stellar populations .",

    "these observations have been interpreted with multiple populations of stars with different helium abundance , from primordial abundance , @xmath20.246 , up to extreme enhancement , @xmath20.38 ( e.g.dantona et al.2002 , 2005 ; piotto et al.2007 ; milone et al.2012a ) .",

    "the ultraviolet region of the spectrum is indeed very powerful in the study of multiple stellar populations with different chemical composition .",

    "* we have identified five distinct stellar groups along the rgb of ngc2808 , namely a , b , c , d , and e , which contain 5.8@xmath310.5% , 17.4@xmath310.9% , 26.4@xmath311.2% , 31.3@xmath311.3% , and 19.1@xmath311.0% of the total number of rgb stars with @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the five stellar populations have been also detected along the ms althougth the separation between ms - a , ms - b , and ms - c is less evident than in the case of the rgb .",
    "we have found that the red ms discovered by piotto et al.(2007 ) is composed of populations a , b , and c , while their middle and the blue ms correspond to population d and e , respectively .",
    "* we have exploited high - resolution spectroscopy from literature to infer the abundance of na , o , al , and mg for the five stellar populations .",
    "first of all , we have identified the rgb - a  e stars for which chemical abundances from high - resolution spectroscopy are available .",
    "specifically , carretta et al.(2006 ) and carretta(2014 ) have found large star - to - star variations of [ na / fe ] , [ o / fe ] , [ al , fe ] , and [ mg / fe ] and identified three groups of o - normal , o - poor , and o - super - poor stars .",
    "we have matched the sample by carretta and collaborators with our multi - wavelength photometry and found that 32 of their stars belong to populations b , c , d , and e as defined in this paper .",
    "+ using the spectroscopic information , we found that population b has solar sodium - to - iron abundance ratio and is enhanced in oxygen ( [ o / fe]@xmath10.3 dex ) .",
    "population c is enhanced in sodium ( [ na / fe]@xmath10.2 ) dex and slightly depleted in oxygen by @xmath1030.1 dex with respect to population b. populations d and e are both sodium rich and oxygen poor and have [ na / fe]@xmath10.4 and [ na / fe]@xmath10.8 , and [ o / fe]@xmath1040.4 and [ o / fe]@xmath1040.7 , respectively .",
    "unfortunately , no population - a rgb stars have spectroscopic information . abundances of magnesium and aluminum are available only for three population - b and two population - c stars .",
    "all of them are distributed around [ mg / fe]@xmath10.4 and [ al / fe]@xmath10.1 with the two population - c stars being , on average , slightly enhanced in [ al / fe ] by @xmath10.1 dex .",
    "a larger sample is mandatory to establish if such a difference in al is significant or not .",
    "* we have inferred the content of helium , c , n , o for the five populations of ngc2808 . to do this ,",
    "we have followed the method by milone et al.(2012b ) and compared the observed colors with predictions from synthetic spectra .",
    "we found that populations d and e are enhanced in helium by @xmath10.06 and @xmath10.11 , respectively , with respect to the populations b and c which share almost the same helium abundance .",
    "this helium difference follows from the assumption that population a and b have the same metallicity . from this assumption",
    "it also descend that population a has @xmath10.03 less helium than both population b and c. planned spectroscopic observations in particular of population a stars may allow us to test this assumption , and indicate whether the photometric differences between these two populations can be ascribed to iron and oxygen differences , rather than to helium . if we assume that population a has primordial helium ( y=0.246 ) ,",
    "our results indicate that population - e stars are highly helium enhanced up to @xmath20.39 .",
    "+ note that it is the effect of helium - abundance variations on stellar temperatures that mostly causes optical and uv colors to change .",
    "indeed stars with the same luminosity but different @xmath91 have different effective temperature and gravity . on the contrary",
    ", helium has a marginal effect on the stellar atmosphere .",
    "( sbordone et al.2011 ) .",
    "+ the comparison of observed and synthetic colors allow us to also estimate the average abundance of c , n , and o for each stellar population .",
    "we found that populations c , d , and e are enhanced in nitrogen by @xmath10.5 , @xmath10.6 , and @xmath10.8 dex with respect to population b , while population a has slight lower nitrogen ( @xmath0[n / fe]@xmath10.1 ) than population b. both oxygen and carbon anti - correlate with nitrogen .",
    "* we have detected the rgb bump of populations b , c , d , and e. in visual filters , which are marginally affected by light element - variations , the bump of population b and c have almost the same luminosity , while the rgb bump of population d and e are @xmath10.07 and @xmath10.17 mag brighter .",
    "the comparison of the observed bump luminosity with theoretical models suggests that populations d and e are more helium rich than both population b and c by @xmath10.03 and @xmath10.06 dex , respectively .",
    "* we confirm that the hb of ngc2808 is multi - modal with four main hb segments .",
    "in addition , we confirm that the red hb is inconsistent with a simple stellar population as suggested by the fact that the two groups of sodium - rich and sodium - poor stars identified by marino et al.(2014 ) populate different regions along the red hb .",
    "* the agb hosts three main sequences that are well distinguishable in the @xmath40 vs.@xmath105 diagram .",
    "this finding indicates that the agb of ngc2808 hosts multiple stellar populations .    in conclusion , the most astonishing property of this cluster is certainly its extremely complex stellar populations , as illustrated in figs .",
    "[ summaryngc2808 ] and [ selergbs ] .",
    "we have distinguished five discrete stellar populations , but a closer look at the hess diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ selergbs ] suggests that reality may be even more complex .",
    "indeed , all five clumps appear to have some internal structure , as if each of them could further split in two components , or having an internal spread in its photometric properties which may result from a small spread in chemical composition .",
    "this is particularly evident for populations b and c. we notice that our photometric data have an accuracy of @xmath106 mag , sufficient to resolve individual clumps , but distinguishing between an internal spread or a multiplicity would require larger samples of stars .",
    "the clear _ discreteness _ of the five ( main ) populations is a fact that every scenario for the formation of gcs must be able to account for . as emphasized in paperi",
    ", this kind of discreteness is indeed an ubiquitous property among gcs and can not be ignored .",
    "it suggests that star formation occurred in a sequence of discrete events interleaved by periods of inactivity while the chemical composition of the interstellar medium was changing .",
    "however , we postpone to a future paper of this collaboration a dedicated discussion as to whether the various proposed scenarios can comply with this and the other observational constraints illustrated in paperi .",
    "it also goes beyond the scope of this paper to try to identify in which temporal sequence the various multiple populations may have been generated , but we need to at least try to identify the _ first _ generation of this cluster .",
    "population b is oxygen rich and sodium poor ( see fig .",
    "8) and also is rather populous ( @xmath107 of the total in our sample ) , so it is the obvious candidate for being the first generation .",
    "however , if this is the case , we have a problem with population a , which is redder than population b in both @xmath8 and @xmath13 and for which no spectroscopic abundances are available from carretta et al.(2006 ) and carretta(2014 ) .",
    "we have argued above that if population b and a would have the same metallicity , than the helium abundance of population a should be lower that that of population b by @xmath108 . since no physical mechanism",
    "is known that could _ deplete _ on such scale the helium abundance below its big bang value , one would be forced to consider population a as the first generation .",
    "this is quite unpalatable , as population a represents only @xmath109 of the whole population of the cluster .",
    "even if a@xmath77b together are regarded as the first generation , still they make only @xmath110 of the whole population sampled by wfc3 at the center of ngc2808 .",
    "however , as in the case of other clusters , the first generation may be less centrally concentrated than subsequent generations and a more extensive mapping of this cluster is required to measure the overall fractions of the various populations .    the alternative is to relax the assumption of these two populations having the same metallicity . like in other clusters ( e.g. m22 , ngc1851 , m2 , ngc5286 )",
    ", a small fraction of the core - collapse supernovae from the first generation may have contaminated the interstellar medium while such stellar population was still in the making .",
    "an increase of [ fe / h ] by @xmath111 dex , associated to a parallel increase in oxygen as expected from core collapse supernovae , could then account for the photometric differences between population a and b. our group is already engaged in high - resolution spectroscopic observations with giraffe at the very large telescope and spectra of stars in the five rgbs of ngc2808 are going to be obtained soon .",
    "in particular , the abundances of iron , carbon , nitrogen , oxygen and sodium will be measured for population a , hence assessing whether this interpretation is viable .",
    "moreover it should be noticed that , although some authors have suggested that multiple sequences are associated to distinct generations of stars , the possibility that gcs have experienced multiple or prolonged events of star formation is still strongly debated .",
    "we refer to papers by bastian et al.2013 ; cabrera ziri et al.2014 , 2015 ; niederhofer et al.2014 ; dercole et al.2008 , 2010 ; dantona et al.2005 ; renzini et al.2008 ; decressin et al.2007 ; denissenkov et al.2015 and references therein for critical discussion and for various scenarios and interpretations of multiple stellar populations .",
