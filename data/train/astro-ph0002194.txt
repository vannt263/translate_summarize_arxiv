    "( 1997 ) traced the evolution of the lorentz - factor of secondary particles on account of magnetic inverse compton scattering above the polar gap .",
    "our aim is to investigate in more detail the influence of resonant inverse compton scattering on the parameters of secondary plasma . for the resonant character of the scattering , the evolution of particle lorentz - factor with the distance depends strongly on the initial particle energy . since the distribution function of the secondary plasma is generally believed to be rather broad ( the lorentz - factor ranges from @xmath6 to @xmath7 ) , its evolution on account of the compton scattering is of a great interest .",
    "it will be shown that only particles with lorentz - factors between 100 and 1000 are essentially decelerated in the course of the resonant scattering forming a sharp peak at low energies .",
    "particles with larger lorentz - factors are not decelerated at all .",
    "thus , the resultant distribution function of secondary particles becomes two - humped , giving rise to the two - stream instability .    in sect .",

    "section 3 is devoted to studying the evolution of the distribution function .",

    "the neutron star is supposed to emit a blackbody radiation , which is scattered by the plasma particles . in a strong magnetic field",

    "provided that the magnetic field is dipolar , @xmath25 .",
    "numerical solutions of eq .",
    "( 2 ) are presented in fig . 1",
    ".    one can see that the resonant inverse compton scattering is significant up to @xmath26 and it affects the particle lorentz - factor essentially .",
    "note that the curves for different initial lorentz - factors are not similar to each other . in agreement with eq .",
    "( 1 ) , the larger the particle lorentz - factor the lower is the energy of resonantly scattered photons . at @xmath27",
    "the energy of the resonant photons is below @xmath28 , which corresponds to the maximum in the photon distribution . as @xmath10 is decreasing with the altitude , the resonant energy increases .",
    "hence , the photon spectral density increases and the scattering becomes more efficient .",
    "however , at distances @xmath26 it ceases due to the essential shrinking of the solid angle subtended by the neutron star .",
    "if the initial lorentz - factor is @xmath29 , the energy of resonant photons is above @xmath30 and further increases with the altitude , so that the scattering gradually ceases .",
    "theoretical models predict that the polar cap region should be significantly hotter than the rest surface of the neutron star ( _ e.g. _ cheng & ruderman 1980 , arons 1981 , alpar _ et al .",
    "_ 1984 , umeda _",
    "_ 1993 , luo 1996 ) .",
    "however , the luminosities observed from the hot spots appear to be too small ( finley _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 , halpern & ruderman 1993 , becker & trumper 1993 , yancopoulos _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 , greiveldinger _",
    "the latter is usually interpreted as a consequence of small hot spot radii ( _ e.g. _ yancopoulos _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 , greiveldinger _",
    "_ 1996 ) . as is evident from fig.1 , for typical hot spot parameters the particle energy loss",
    "is mainly determined by the scattering of the photons from the whole neutron star rather than by the scattering of hot spot photons .",
    "so hereafter we take into account only the photons from the whole neutron star surface keeping in mind that the influence of hot spot photons can somehow alter our quantitative results , while the qualitative picture should remain the same .",
    "it should be pointed out that the evolution of lorentz - factor with the altitude shown in fig . 1 is somewhat different from that reported by zhang _",
    "et al._(1997)(see their fig .",
    "1 ) . these authors claim that at distances @xmath31 the particles suffer severe nonresonant magnetized scattering , which leads to the drastic decrease of the final lorentz - factor .",
    "in fact , the rate of energy loss on account of nonresonant magnetic scattering increases with decreasing the field strength as @xmath32 ( see eq .",
    "( 5 ) in sturner 1995 ) .",
    "however , this equation is applicable only if in the particle rest frame the cyclotron energy exceeds the energy of most of photons , @xmath33 . for the photon energies at the peak of the planck distribution , @xmath34 ,",
    "the latter condition can be rewritten as @xmath35 , with @xmath36 .",
    "taking @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ( zhang _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 , fig .",
    "1a ) , one can obtain that at @xmath40 the left - hand side of this inequality is @xmath41 , while at @xmath42 it equals @xmath43 .",
    "so even at the stellar surface most of the photons scatter in the thomson regime rather than in the magnetic one .",
    "the rate of energy loss out of the thomson scattering is found to be @xmath44 showing that this process is inefficient .",
    "thus the resonant inverse compton scattering is the only significant energy loss mechanism for the secondary particles in pulsar magnetospheres .",
    "we believe that the particles start deceleration just above the polar gap . in general the gap thickness",
    "is supposed to be of the order of the polar cap radius ( ruderman & sutherland 1975 ) or even larger ( arons & scharlemann 1979 ) . the energy loss of secondary particles due to the resonant inverse compton scattering above the gap should certainly be influenced by the adopted value of the gap height . in fig .",
    "2 we show the final lorentz - factors versus the gap height .",
    "one can see that the dependence is sufficiently weak , therefore , below we fix @xmath45 at @xmath46 .",
    "in contrast with the gap height , such pulsar parameters as the star temperature and magnetic field strength can influence particle deceleration essentially . in fig .",
    "3 we present the dependences of the normalized final lorentz - factor on the neutron star temperature at various magnetic field strengths .",
    "apparently , at the temperatures @xmath47 k the scattering is inefficient yet , while at higher temperatures it becomes significant .",
    "note that at various initial lorentz - factors ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) the scattering efficiency versus magnetic field strength is essentially different . the particles with @xmath48 resonantly scatter the photons from the wien region .",
    "then the weaker the field strength , the lower is the energy of resonant photons and , correspondingly , the higher is the photon spectral density and the larger is the particle energy loss ( see fig .",
    "3a ) . at @xmath27",
    "the resonant energy lies in the rayleigh - jeans region .",
    "so the scattering is more efficient for higher magnetic field strengths , since the photon spectral density increases with the energy ( see fig .",
    "3b ) .    for the resonant character of",
    "the scattering the particle energy loss depends strongly on the initial lorentz - factor .",
    "figure 4 shows the final lorentz - factor versus the initial one for various neutron star temperatures and magnetic field strengths . at @xmath50 as well as at @xmath51",
    "the resonant scattering appears to be inefficient .",
    "provided that the scattering is intense ( @xmath52 ) , the final lorentz - factor appears to be independent of the initial one . according to fig .",
    "4a , the length of the plateau increases with the star temperature .",
    "in fact , the higher temperature implies the larger amount of photons at every energy , the scattering becoming more efficient . as can be seen from fig .",
    "4b , the increase of the magnetic field strength leads to the shift of the plateau toward a higher energy ; this is certainly consistent with the resonance condition ( 1 ) .",
    "since the energy loss depends essentially on the initial particle energy , we are to investigate the evolution of the distribution function of secondary particles as a result of the resonant inverse compton scattering .",
    "conservation of the number of particles along a phase trajectory implies that @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the particle distribution function and the subscript  0  refers to the initial values .",
    "so looking for the phase trajectories of individual particles one can reconstruct the distribution function at any height @xmath16 .",
    "we are particularly interested in the final distribution function arising at distances , where the resonant scattering ceases .",
    "let us begin with the evolution of a waterbag distribution function : @xmath55 with @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "the final distribution functions at various pulsar parameters are plotted in fig .",
    "5 . the particles with @xmath58 are essentially decelerated due to the scattering , the final energies becoming equal ( see also fig .",
    "these particles form the sharp peak at @xmath59 . for the lorentz - factors of a few thousand",
    "the scattering becomes inefficient and the distribution function remains almost unaltered .",
    "thus , the resonant inverse compton scattering leads to the two - humped distribution function of the secondary plasma . at higher",
    "neutron star temperatures the main peak of the function shifts towards the lower energies and the humps become more prominent .",
    "the magnetic field strength variation also results in the shift of the main peak . for the more realistic distribution function resembling that found by arons ( 1980 ) , @xmath60 with @xmath61 , @xmath62 , the evolution on account of the resonant inverse compton scattering is qualitatively the same ( see fig . 6 ) .",
    "we next examine the dispersion properties of the plasma with the evolved distribution function . for simplicity",
    "let us assume that the plasma consists of the two particle flows characterized by the number densities @xmath63 , @xmath64 and by the lorentz - factors @xmath65 , @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) . given the infinitely strong magnetic field , the dispersion relation is as follows ( see , _ e.g. _ lyubarskii 1995 ) : @xmath68 here @xmath69 is the frequency , @xmath70 the wave number , @xmath71 are the particle velocities , @xmath72 the plasma frequencies given by the customary expression : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the electron charge , @xmath75 the electron mass . as is evident from eq .",
    "( 6 ) , the dispersion properties of the plasma are mainly determined by one of the particle flows on condition that @xmath76 rather than @xmath77 .",
    "this is because of the great inertia of the fast particles performing one - dimensional motion in the superstrong magnetic field . for the distribution functions plotted in fig . 5 and 6 @xmath63 and @xmath64 are comparable , while @xmath78 .",
    "therefore the low - energy particles of the main peak almost completely determine the dispersion properties of the plasma .",
    "the two - humped distribution function implies the possibility of the two - stream instability .",
    "provided that the contribution of one of the plasma flows to the plasma dispersion is small ( _ i.e. _ eq .",
    "( 8) is valid ) , the growth rate of the instability takes the form ( lominadze & mikhailovskii 1979 , cheng & ruderman 1980 ) : @xmath79 the two - stream instability results in an essential development of initial perturbations on condition that @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the characteristic scale length for the increase of perturbations .",
    "it is convenient to normalize the number density of the secondary plasma by the goldreich - julian charge density : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the multiplicity factor of the secondary plasma , @xmath84 the pulsar period .",
    "the latter equation can be rewritten as : @xmath85 where @xmath86 . using eqs .",
    "( 9 ) and ( 12 ) in eq .",
    "( 10 ) we reduce the condition for the efficient instability development to the form : @xmath87 here @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and it is assumed that @xmath91 . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( 13 ) , at typical pulsar parameters the two - stream instability can develop readily providing the increase of plasma oscillations .",
    "the latter can be transformed into electromagnetic waves , thus giving rise to pulsar radio emission .",
    "it should be mentioned that two - steram instability has always been one of the most popular mechanisms for pulsar radio emission . for more than two decades",
    "a number of scenarios for the instability development were proposed .",
    "the first and the most natural one involves the instability caused by the flows of primary and secondary pulsar plasma ( ruderman & sutherland 1975 ) .",
    "however , the growth rate of this instability appears to be too small because of enormous inertia of the high - energy primary particles ( benford & buschauer 1977 ) .",
    "cheng & ruderman ( 1977 ) considered the two - stream instability arising in the secondary plasma due to the difference in the velocities of electrons and positrons moving along the curved magnetic lines .",
    "however , this difference is insufficient to cause the instability , since the particle distribution functions are too broad ( buschauer & benford 1977 ) .",
    "lyubarskii ( 1993 ) suggested that current and charge density adjustment in pulsar magnetosphere leads to the backward particle flow , which causes intense two - stream instability .",
    "however , numerical simulations of the plasma flow in the open field line tube are necessary to prove this idea .",
    "given nonstationary generation of the secondary plasma the particles are confined to the separate clouds , and the fastest particles of a cloud can outstrip the slower particles of the previous cloud giving rise to the two - stream instability ( usov 1987 , ursov & usov 1988 ) .",
    "up to now it is not clear whether the instability initiated in such a way can account for pulsar radio emission , since the nonstationarity of plasma generation is not studied in detail yet .",
    "the present paper suggests one more possibility of two - stream instability in pulsars , which is based on the selective energy loss of particles as a result of resonant inverse compton scattering .",
    "note that in this model the instability arises naturally , with no additional assumptions being involved .",
    "the photons produced by the resonant inverse compton scattering have the energies @xmath92 so that typically @xmath93 mev .",
    "note that the curvature gamma - photons produced in the polar gap as well as the photons upscattered by the primary particles have essentially higher energies , @xmath94 mev .",
    "hence , the resonant scattering by secondary plasma results in an additional low - energy component in pulsar gamma - ray spectrum .",
    "the spectrum of this component in the case of some specific distribution functions of the scattering particles is obtained by daugherty & harding ( 1989 ) . in general ,",
    "the low - energy tail of this component spreads even to the x - ray band on account of the photons resonantly scattered at distances @xmath95 , where the magnetic field strength decreases essentially .",
    "however , these photons are very few , since at @xmath95 the scattering rate decreases significantly due to the shrinking of the solid angle subtended by the neutron star .    given that the scattering is efficient , most of the energy of the secondary plasma should be transferred to the low - energy gamma - rays .",
    "the luminosity provided by the upscattered photons can be estimated as follows : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the cross - sectional area of the open field line tube , @xmath98 @xmath99 is the light cylinder radius , @xmath100 the difference between the lorentz - factors of the particles , which mainly contribute to the final and initial plasma energy , @xmath101 . substituting eqs . (",
    "12 ) and ( 16 ) into eq .",
    "( 15 ) we find : @xmath102    although in the particle rest frame the photons are scattered in all directions , in the laboratory frame they are beamed along the particle velocity . so the opening angle of the gamma - ray beam is given by @xmath103",
    "the averaged observed photon flux , @xmath104 , is related to the luminosity as @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the solid angle occupied by the beam of upscattered photons , @xmath107 the distance to the pulsar , @xmath108 the energy band .",
    "taking into account eq .",
    "( 17 ) , eq . ( 18 ) can be rewritten as @xmath109 where @xmath110 , @xmath111 .    for most pulsars the flux given by eq .",
    "( 19 ) is too low to be detected . at present",
    "the detectors of the compton gamma - ray observatory are the most sensitive to the low - energy gamma - ray emission ( osse at 0.0510 mev and comptel at 130 mev ) . at 1 mev",
    "the source sensitivity of osse is only @xmath112 photons/(@xmath113 ) ( gehrels & shrader 1996 ) . in the observations reported by kuiper _",
    "( 1996 ) the flux from geminga in the band of 310 mev was found to be @xmath114 photons/(@xmath113 ) .",
