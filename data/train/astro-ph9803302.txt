    "sebo & wood ( 1995 ) .    the longer period cepheids are particularly important in the context of the primary distance scale because they are bright enough to be visibile at a great distance .",
    "however , due to their low number , they have been poorly studied both observationally and theoretically .",
    "simon & kanbur ( @xcite ) considered 50 cepheids in galaxy and ic 4182 with period @xmath11 less than 70 d , compared them with hydrodynamical pulsation models and concluded that a detailed comparison between theory and observations must await a more extensive and accurate sample of observed stars .",
    "antonello & morelli ( @xcite ) analyzed all the available photometric @xmath12 data of galactic cepheids with period less than 70 d looking for possible resonance effects ; they noted some small features in the fourier parameters ",
    "period diagrams which were ascribed tentatively to expected resonances .",
    "aikawa & antonello ( @xcite ) tried to reproduce these observations with nonlinear models , but their conclusion was that the increasing nonadiabaticity of the pulsation with period probably reduces the effectiveness of resonance mechanisms .",
    "finally , simon & young ( @xcite ) studied long period cepheids in the period range @xmath13 d in magellanic clouds looking for galaxy - to - galaxy differences in the cepheid distributions .",
    "resonances between pulsation modes , which were studied essentially in cepheids with @xmath11 less than about 30 d , represent a powerful comparison tool between observations and theoretical model predictions , because they affect the shape of the curves of pulsating stars in specific period ranges .",
    "the comparison of the fourier parameters of observed and theoretical light and radial velocity curves allows to probe the stellar interior and to put constraints on the stellar physical parameters . after the work of simon & lee ( @xcite ) on the resonance @xmath14 at @xmath15 d between the fundamental and second overtone mode in classical bump cepheids , several papers by various authors were devoted to this topic , from both the observational and theoretical point of view .",
    "for example , buchler & kovacs ( @xcite ) and moskalik & buchler ( @xcite ) studied the general effects of 2:1 and 3:1 resonances in radial stellar pulsations and discussed the possible astrophysical implications , petersen ( @xcite ) discussed the possible two- and three - mode resonances in cepheids , and antonello ( @xcite ) looked for the expected effects in short period cepheids .",
    "recent reviews on galactic and magellanic cloud cepheids pulsating in fundamental and first overtone mode and on the problems raised by the comparison with the pulsational models are those by buchler ( @xcite ) and beaulieu & sasselov ( @xcite ) .",
    "the resonance effects in magellanic cloud cepheids can not be reproduced by models constructed using current input physics and reasonable mass  luminosity relations ; in particular the case of first overtone cepheids characterized by @xmath16 ( antonello et al .",
    "@xcite ) has proven to be rather difficult for theorists .",
    "we mention in passing also the recent resonance @xmath17 , studied in the models of hypothetical second overtone mode cepheids ( antonello & kanbur @xcite ) .    in the present work we have considered the long - period cepheids in magellanic clouds , with available photometric and radial velocity data which were suitable for fourier decomposition .",
    "the initial purpose of the work was simply to extend the comparison between theory and observations to cepheids with the longest known periods , but the probable discovery of a new resonance effect suggested to publish the present letter in advance of the comparison with the hydrodynamical models ( antonello & aikawa , in preparation ) .",
    "the cepheids with available data for a reliable analysis are reported in table 1 , where the subscript @xmath18 refers to the light curve data and the subscript @xmath19 to the radial velocity data .",
    "the stars are identified with the harvard variable number , while the letters l and s indicate large and small magellanic cloud , respectively .",
    "the other columns give the period , the number of data points , the sources of the data , the order of fourier fit and the standard deviation of the fit for both light and radial velocity curves .",
    "the time interval of all the photometric ( @xmath12 magnitude ) data is quite long for each star , usually about 22 years , and during this interval the period change ( probably related to evolution ) is significant , therefore it was not always possible to use all of the available data for the fourier decomposition .",
    "in particular , for hv 5497 and hv 2447 only the observations in the time interval between jd 2442300 and 2442900 were used .",
    "the best photometric period was derived for each star , while for the radial velocity data the adopted period was essentially the same as reported in the literature .",
    "the photometric and radial velocity periods are usually different , because of the different observing dates .",
    "see e.g. van genderen ( 1983 ) for a discussion of period changes in magellanic cloud cepheids .",
    "the adopted formula for the fourier decomposition was @xmath20,\\ ] ] _ for both light and radial velocity curves _ ; in some data sets few deviating points were discarded .",
    "the tables 2 and 3 with the fourier parameters , that is phase differences @xmath21 and amplitude ratios @xmath22 , are available at cds . for some stars with period between 30 and 50 d , such as hv2195",
    ", the fitted curve shows unphysical wiggles , a defect which is typical of curves with steep rising branch ( antonello & morelli @xcite ) . the criteria adopted for determining the best fit were similar to those of previous works ; usually these criteria yield different orders of best fit for different stars .",
    "however , for stars with good phase coverage as in the present case , the lower order fourier parameters do not change significantly when the fit is truncated at different higher orders ( see antonello et al .",
    "after examining the fourier parameters we suspected the existence of a hertzsprung  type progression for long - period cepheids . in fig .",
    "1 we have plotted the radial velocity and light curves of the cepheids with period longer than 45 d. it is possible to see that the velocity curve differs from the normal shape at @xmath23 d , it becomes progressively more symmetric and then takes again the normal shape after @xmath24 d. the light curves tend to become more symmetric with increasing period , and between 90 and 134 d the shape changes near the maximum , with the possible presence of a small bump and flat or secondary maximum .",
    "the low order fourier parameters are plotted in fig . 2 and compared with those of long - period cepheids in the galaxy .",
    "the data for the galactic cepheids were taken from kovacs et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , aikawa & antonello ( @xcite ) and antonello & morelli ( @xcite ) .",
    "there is a scatter or change of phase differences @xmath25 of the radial velocity curves in the period range 90 - 134 d , while the @xmath26 values of light curves are quite uniform and the @xmath27 values are scattered . in the same period",
    "range the amplitude ratios @xmath28 are rather small , both for radial velocity and light curves .",
    "these results remind in part what occurs in fundamental mode cepheids with @xmath29 d and in first overtone mode cepheids with @xmath30 d ; the main difference is the uniformity of @xmath26 values of the light curves in the present case .    before offering the possible interpretation ,",
    "some remarks are needed : a ) the number of stars in our sample is poor , and we have not discriminated between smc and lmc cepheids ; b ) the accuracy of the photometric measurements is not very high and the problems related to the period changes can not be avoided when selecting the data set for the analysis , if the observations span many years ; c ) the coravel radial velocity data were obtained in a short time span ( less than five years ) , but three cepheids , namely hv 837 , hv 11157 and hv 883 , are binary , and their pulsation curves were derived by imbert ( 1994 ) by correcting for the orbital motion . in spite of these warnings , we think the progression of the curves is real and it is related to a resonance mechanism .",
    "the linear adiabatic models indicate @xmath1 between the fundamental and the first overtone mode as a possible candidate .",
    "some years ago , petersen ( @xcite ) discussed this theoretical case using the old opacities , and suggested that the resonance center should be expected at @xmath31 d. as a matter of fact , the adiabatic models seem to indicate that the lower overtones tend to satisfy almost simultaneously the relation @xmath32 , or , in other words , their frequencies tend to be coincident with the harmonics of the fundamental mode frequency",
    ". however , according to the linear nonadiabatic models these resonances should not occur in the observed period range , since the strong nonadiabaticity gives very different periods and period ratios from adiabatic model results ( aikawa , private communication ) .    from the comparison of galactic and magellanic cloud cepheids it is possible to note",
    "that , even if rather scattered , the distribution of amplitude ratio values differs according to the galaxy : in the magellanic clouds , for @xmath33 d , the @xmath28 values can be larger than in the galaxy .",
    "this result is probably related to the analogous differences of pulsation amplitude among cepheids in different galaxies , studied for example by van genderen ( @xcite ) .",
    "the low number of stars do not allow to study possible differences between lmc and smc .",
    "= 13truecm    = 9.5truecm",
    "the analysis of the radial velocity and light curves of the long - period cepheids in the magellanic clouds indicates the presence of a progression which we interpret tentatively as an effect of the resonance @xmath1 between the fundamental and the first overtone mode .",
    "since the longest period cepheids are also the brightest , the present results could be of some importance for the study of stellar structure and evolution in far galaxies , because the stars with @xmath34 100 d ( @xmath35 mag ) are about three magnitudes brighter than those at 10 d , in which the well known resonance @xmath14 is occurring .",
    "the disadvantage is the low number of such stars .",
    "few cepheids with @xmath36 d have been found in relatively nearby galaxies ( ngc 6822 , ic 1613 , ngc 300 ; see e.g. madore @xcite ) , while in the magellanic clouds there are just a few of stars in comparison with a total of some thousand cepheids .",
    "presently the hubble space telescope key project on the extragalactic distance scale is optimized for the detection of cepheids with period between 3 and 60 d ( e.g. ferrarese et al .",
    "@xcite ) , therefore it is not possible to derive reliable conclusions about the number of long - period stars .",
    "we just note that in ngc 925 silbermann et al .",
    "( @xcite ) found 4 stars with probable @xmath36 d over a total of 80 cepheids .    assuming that a sufficient number of such stars is detected and our interpretation is correct",
    ", the comparison of the observed resonance effect with nonlinear model predictions will allow to test the input physics and put constraints on the physical parameters of the stars in relatively far galaxies in the same way as it is occurring for the galaxy and magellanic cloud cepheids with shorter periods .",
    "thanks are due to t. aikawa and l. mantegazza for comments and discussions .",
    "this research has made use of the mcmaster cepheid photometry and radial velocity data archive ( http://www.physics.mcmaster.ca/cepheid ) .",
