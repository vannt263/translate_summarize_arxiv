    "warp drives  @xcite allow , at least theoretically , to travel at arbitrary high superluminal speeds and consequently to travel in time  @xcite . however , besides the fact that they require matter distributions violating positive energy conditions  @xcite , they are quantum mechanically unstable because they possess a white hole horizon and a cauchy horizon on which the renormalized stress - energy tensor blows up exponentially  @xcite . in this paper , we reexamine the question of their stability when postulating that lorenz invariance is broken at ultrahigh energy .",
    "in this we were motivated by the fact that nonlinear dispersion relations remove cauchy horizons and regulate the fluxes emitted by white holes  @xcite .",
    "a superluminal warp drive metric describes a bubble containing an almost flat region , moving at some constant speed @xmath0 within an asymptotically flat space - time : @xmath1 ^ 2+dy^2+dz^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the distance from the center of the bubble .",

    "in fact , the hawking flux emitted by the black horizon accumulates on the white horizon while being unboundlessly blueshifted .",
    "however , since the whole analysis rests on relativistic quantum field theory , one should examine whether the warp drive s instability is peculiar to the local lorentz symmetry .",
    "although current observations constrain to ultrahigh energy a possible breaking of that symmetry  @xcite , one can not exclude this possibility which has been suggested by theoretical investigations  @xcite . for the sake of simplicity we work in @xmath9 dimensions and ignore the transverse directions @xmath10 and @xmath11 . defining a new spatial coordinate @xmath12 ,",

    "one thus gets three regions : @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ( see fig .",

    "that is , pair production here occurs through a two - channel hawking - like mechanism . to approximately compute the coefficients of eq .   in the regime",
    "@xmath70 we use connection formula techniques .",
    "we first decompose @xmath71 in both asymptotic regions @xmath17 and @xmath19 as a sum of plane waves : @xmath72 the coefficients are connected by @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively , describe the _ off - shell _ scattering on the two horizons  @xcite and @xmath76 describes the wkb propagation from one horizon to the other , i.e. it is diagonal and contains the exponential of @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is @xmath40 , @xmath43 , or @xmath44 . by",
    "_ off - shell _ we mean that these three matrices are not restricted to the two modes that govern the asymptotic scattering on each horizon considered separately , that is the growing mode is here kept in the mode mixing .",
    "in fact , since @xmath79 has negative imaginary part , @xmath80 is exponentially large .",
    "simple wkb algebra shows that it grows as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the distance between the two horizons .",
    "concomitantly , since @xmath83 , @xmath84 is exponentially small .",
    "let us show with an example how to determine the coefficients of eq .  .",
    "the globally defined @xmath57 is constructed by imposing that the asymptotic amplitudes of the two incoming branches @xmath85 both vanish , see fig .",
    "[ fig : mode ] .",
    "therefore , the three outgoing amplitudes are given by the second row of the matrix of eq .  .",
    "moreover , using eq .  , these coefficients correspond to @xmath86 and @xmath87 . solving the resulting system ,",
    "we obtain @xmath88 where the @xmath89 s and @xmath90 s in the above are the standard bogoliubov coefficients for black and white holes that encode the thermal hawking radiation  @xcite . by a similar analysis of other modes , all coefficients of eq .   can be computed .",
    "although the nonpositive definite conservation law of eq .",
    "( [ current ] ) does not bound these coefficients , the exponentially large factor in @xmath81 cancels out from all of them . as a consequence , as can be seen in eq .  , the leading term is , up to some phase coming from the wkb propagation in region @xmath18 , given by the bogoliubov coefficients of @xmath74 and @xmath75  @xcite . in the first two lines ,",
    "one finds a product of two coefficients because the associated semiclassical trajectory passes through both horizons . instead , in the third line only one coefficient is found because there is only a reflection on the black horizon .    to identify the physical consequences of the pair creation encoded in eq .",

    "hence , the renormalized tensor @xmath98 is obtained by normal ordering the above creation and destruction _ out _ operators .",
    "[ the fact that there exist negative frequency asymptotic particles causes no problem in this respect .",
    "in fact , all asymptotic excitations have a positive comoving frequency @xmath34 of eq .  .",
    "] imposing that the initial state is vacuum , using eq .  , it is straightforward to compute @xmath99 .",
    "the final expression contains an integral over @xmath31 of a sum of terms , each being the product of two modes @xmath100 and two coefficients of eq .  .",
    "we do not need the exact expression because we only consider possible divergences . when @xmath101 there are no negative frequency modes .",
    "hence , the @xmath90 coefficients of eq .   vanish for @xmath102 , and the stress - energy tensor can not have ultraviolet divergences .",
    "therefore , the only possible divergence can be found for @xmath103 .    in each term of @xmath92 , there are two derivatives with respect to @xmath104 or @xmath105 , leading to two powers of @xmath31 , @xmath106 , or @xmath107 .",
    "analogously in @xmath93 , there are 4 powers of these .",
    "now , from fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersion ] we see that the wavenumbers @xmath108 do not vanish for @xmath103 in @xmath17 .",
    "rather , they go to constant opposite values , that we call @xmath109 and @xmath110 , respectively .",
    "interestingly , these modes played a key role in  @xcite when studying the fluxes emitted by a white hole flow in an atomic bose condensate .",
    "they are also associated with the macroscopic _ undulation _ observed in the experiments  @xcite and theoretically described in sec .",
    "iii.b.3 of  @xcite .",
    "finally , the terms containing only spatial derivatives will not be suppressed for @xmath103 .",
    "the leading terms in @xmath111 are thus proportional to @xmath112 .",
    "\\label{leading}\\ ] ] the above integral gives the integrated mean occupation number of the two _ out _ species , and @xmath113 is their asymptotic group velocity in the @xmath25 frame .",
    "the leading terms of @xmath114 are proportional to eq .",
    "up to an extra factor of @xmath115 . since @xmath116 ,",
    "one finds that the @xmath117 and @xmath118 components of the stress - energy tensor yield typically the same contribution .",
    "the key result comes from the fact that @xmath119 diverges as @xmath120 for @xmath121 , being the product of @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "( this infrared behavior has been validated by numerical analysis . ) then , if the warp drive is created at some time , after some transient period the geometry will become stationary and the outgoing fluxes will reach their stationary values .",
    "however , only frequencies @xmath124 will contribute after a lapse of time @xmath125 .",
    "this provides an infrared cutoff to the integral of eq .  , which gives an energy density scaling as @xmath126\\propto \\lambda \\kappa^2 t.\\ ] ] that is",
    ", there is an infrared divergence that leads to a linear growth of the energy density .",
    "this result can be understood from the findings of  @xcite : the bh radiation emitted towards the wh horizon stimulates the latter as if a thermal distribution were initially present . in that case",
    ", it was also found that the observable ( the density correlation function ) increased linearly in @xmath125 .    using quantum inequalities  @xcite ,",
    "it was argued  @xcite that @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the planck time , which implies that the growth rate is of the same order ( unless @xmath129 is very different from @xmath130 ) . in the presence of superluminal dispersion ,",
    "warp drives are thus unstable on a short scale .",
    "in this case , the warp drive system is also unstable .",
    "indeed , the positive norm modes @xmath131 and @xmath132 are now trapped between the two horizons in region @xmath18 .",
    "hence , they bounce back and forth and this induces an exponentially growing amplification of the emitted radiation . as a result ,",
    "the asymptotic fluxes , and therefore @xmath99 , grow exponentially in time .",
    "this phenomenon is the subluminal version of the black - hole laser effect  @xcite .",
    "this dynamical instability is described by complex frequency eigenmodes that are asymptotically bounded  @xcite . in the original version ,",
    "the analysis was performed with a superluminal dispersion relation and with a metric like that of eq .   but with @xmath133 at @xmath134 and @xmath135 in the central region ( see added note ) .",
    "however , there is a precise symmetry between that case and the present one  @xcite .",
    "it basically consists in changing both the sign of the dispersion relation and that of @xmath136 , i.e. interchanging sub and superluminal regions .",
    "this symmetry allows to infer that the complex frequencies governing the laser instability will share the same characteristics as in  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the growth rate of the most unstable mode , which is a non trivial function of the surface gravity of each horizon and their separation @xmath82 , can be read of from the expressions of that work .",
    "in this paper , we generalized  @xcite by showing that superluminal warp drives are unstable even when local lorentz invariance is broken at very high energies . when the dispersion relation is subluminal , the horizons act as a resonant cavity producing a dynamical black - hole laser instability  @xcite .",
    "when it is superluminal , instead , the emitted flux grows linearly in time due to infrared effects .    to conclude , we note that in  @xcite it was shown that close timelike curves can be obtained by combining several warp drives .",
    "our results , together with those of  @xcite , weaken that possibility because isolated warp drives are unstable irrespectively of the features of the dispersion relation in the ultraviolet regime . as a consequence , whereas former attempts to tackle the issue of chronology protection deeply relied on local lorentz invariance  @xcite , the present result suggests that this conjecture may be valid also for quantum field theories violating lorentz invariance in the ultraviolet sector .      in fact , in the presence of superluminal dispersion , as it is the case in hoava gravity  @xcite , all black holes could be dynamically unstable .",
    "this conjecture is based on the observation ( see fig .  10 in  @xcite and the associated discussion ) that any significant scattering in the region where @xmath135 induces signs of instability .",
    "it is therefore important to test this conjecture by a linear stability analysis based e.g. on the `` improved '' action of  @xcite ."
