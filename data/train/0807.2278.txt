    "integral _ in the 2040 kev band , including 214 igr sources @xcite .",
    "while _ integral _ provides hard x - ray images of unprecedented quality , it still only localizes sources to @xmath4@xmath5 , which is not nearly adequate for reliably finding optical or ir counterparts . however , a relatively large fraction of the igr sources are persistent , making it possible to detect the sources in the @xmath0110 kev band with _",
    ", _ xmm - newton _ , or _ swift _ , vastly improving their localizations even with short observations with these satellites @xcite .",
    "the group of igr sources that have been identified include 49 active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , 32 high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) , 9 low - mass x - ray binaries , 9 cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , and smaller numbers of other source types @xcite .",
    "probably the biggest surprise is the large number of hmxbs as well as the properties of these systems .",
    "many of the igr hmxbs have large levels of intrinsic ( i.e. , local ) absorption with @xmath6 @xmath3 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and there is evidence in several cases that a strong stellar equatorial outflow is responsible for the absorption @xcite .",
    "in addition to the high column densities , some members of the group of igr hmxbs exhibit other extreme properties , including the high amplitude x - ray flaring of the supergiant fast x - ray transients ( sfxts , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and neutron stars with very long , @xmath010006000  s , spin periods @xcite , which may , in at least some cases , be due to very high neutron star magnetic fields @xcite .    in order to determine the nature of more of the unclassified igr sources , we have been obtaining observations of igr sources in the galactic plane with the _ chandra x - ray observatory_. we observed 4 sources during _ chandra _ observing cycle 6 , obtained sub - arcsecond localizations for all 4 , and found that 2 of these sources are cvs , 1 is an hmxb , and 1 is a likely hmxb @xcite .",
    "when we selected targets for our cycle 8 proposal ( in 2006 march ) , we considered all the igr sources that had been detected at that time ( now , the number has nearly doubled , and we are observing many of the recently detected sources in cycle 9 ) . as we are interested in galactic sources , we selected sources that are within @xmath7 of the galactic plane .",
    "we also eliminated sources from our list that were considered to be likely active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , and this left us with a list of 20 targets .    between 2006 december and 2008 february , we obtained cycle 8 _ chandra _ observations of these 20 igr sources .",
    "the goals of the observations are to provide a sub - arcsecond position for each source to facilitate an optical / ir identification and to obtain a soft x - ray spectrum . in the following ,",
    "we describe the _ chandra _ observations and our analysis of these data in  @xmath8 . for the cases where we obtained sub - arcsecond",
    "_ chandra _ positions , we report on the results of our search for optical and ir counterparts in  @xmath9 .",
    "then , in  @xmath10 , we describe the implications for each source and give our conclusions in  @xmath11 .",
    "between 2006 december and 2008 february , we obtained cycle 8 _ chandra _ observations of 20 igr sources .",
    "the obsids for these @xmath05  ks `` snapshot '' observations taken with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are 75187535 , 7561 , and 7562 , and the igr source names and more details on the observations can be found in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "for each observation , we started with a `` level 1 '' event list produced via the _ chandra _ data pipeline .",
    "we downloaded the most recent level 1 data products as of 2008 march after these were processed at the _ chandra _ x - ray center with pipeline ( `` ascds '' ) versions between 7.6.9 and 7.6.11.1 .",
    "we performed all further data processing locally using the _ chandra _ interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) version 4.0 software and calibration data base ( caldb ) version 3.4.2 . for each observation",
    ", we used the ciao routine acis_process_events to obtain a `` level 2 '' event list and image .",
    "we note that while a level 2 file is produced in the pipeline data , the primary reason that we re - produced the file is so that we would be using the most recent time - dependent gain information .",
    "nineteen of the observations were carried out with acis - s , while the observation of igr  j113056256 ( obsid 7527 ) was carried out with the acis - i to obtain a 16-by-16 arcminute@xmath12 continuous field - of - view ( fov ) rather than the 8-by-32 arcminute@xmath12 continuous fov for acis - s with 4 ccd detectors activated .",
    "although the fov is more favorable for acis - i , acis - s was our first choice because of its better soft x - ray response .",

    "in a few cases , the _ integral _ error circle extended to the adjacent chip ( acis - s2 or acis - s4 ) , and we extended the search to part or all of the adjacent chip . for the search , we used the 0.310  kev images and a detection threshold of @xmath15 , which corresponds to the likely detection of 1 spurious source per acis chip ( with 1024-by-1024 pixels per chip ) .",

    "thus , one expects 0.52 sources for the smallest @xmath13 error circle ( we detect zero ) and 9.4 sources for the largest @xmath14 error circle ( we detect 12 ) . although one does not necessarily expect the source density to be uniform for different pointing directions through the galaxy",
    ", our numbers of detected sources do not require large variations in the source density .",
    "the count rates for these 65 sources also vary widely from @xmath16@xmath17  c / s ( @xmath165 counts ) to nearly 0.5  c / s ( @xmath02,500 counts ) .",
    "the median number of counts per source is 9.6 , while the mean is 141.8 , indicating that there is a population of anomalously bright sources in at least some of these pointings .",

    "study of four igr sources @xcite , we measured acis count rates between 0.039 and 0.18  c / s , so the rates for the 11 bright sources mentioned above are in - line with what we expect if these are the _ chandra _ counterparts to the igr sources .",
    "chandra _ positions and acis count rates for these sources are listed in table  [ tab : sources ] .",

    "the other case where there is a possible counterpart outside of the _ integral _ error circle is igr  j174452747 . while the _ integral _ position is good to @xmath25 , we find a 211 count source that is @xmath26 away from the best _ integral _ position at r.a .",

    "however , since both sources are well outside the _ integral _ error circle , it is not clear that either of them is associated with igr  j174452747 .",
    "we extracted 0.310  kev acis spectra for each of the 12 _ chandra _ sources that have likely associations with igr sources using the ciao tool psextract .",
    "we extracted source photons from a circular region centered on each source with radii of between @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the somewhat larger radii are necessary for the cases where the _ chandra _ sources are farther off - axis causing the source photons to be spread over more pixels .",
    "we also extracted background spectra from an annulus with an inner radius of @xmath32 and an outer radius of @xmath33 centered on the source .",
    "we used the ciao tools mkacisrmf and mkarf to produce the acis response matrices .",
    "while we produced spectra re - binned to 11 spectral bins in order to provide an opportunity to look for spectral features , we make use of both binned and unbinned spectra in this work .    we fitted the binned 0.310  kev acis spectra using the xspec v12 software with an absorbed power - law model using @xmath34 statistics . to account for absorption , we used the photoelectric absorption cross sections from @xcite and elemental abundances from @xcite , which correspond to the estimated abundances for the interstellar medium . in 5 cases",
    ", we obtained very poor fits with reduced-@xmath34 values of between 4 and 10 for 9 degrees of freedom ( dof ) , and given the relatively high count rates in these cases ( between 0.197 and 0.235 c / s ) as well as the fact that the strongest residuals are at the high energy end of these spectra ( e.g. , 510 kev ) , we suspect that photon pile - up is the primary cause of the poor fits .",
    "we checked for pile - up for all 12 sources by looking at the number of counts detected above 10 kev , where the acis effective area is too small to expect any source photons to be collected . in the 5 cases where we suspect pile - up due to poor fits ( igr  j090264812 , igr  j113056256 , igr  j145155542 , igr  j172003116 , and igr  j182141318 ) ,",
    "between 9 and 43 counts are detected above 10 kev compared to between 0 and 2 counts in the other 7 cases .",
    "this confirms that we must correct for pile - up for the spectra of the 5 sources listed above .",
    "finally , we note that the count rates for igr  j00234 + 6141 and igr  j182590706 are even higher , at levels of 0.446 and 0.487 c / s , respectively",

    "we re - fitted the 12 spectra using the same absorbed power - law model , but with the addition of the @xcite pile - up model in the 5 cases where pile - up is significant . also , for these fits , we used the unbinned spectra and found the best fit parameters using the cash statistic .",
    "the results are given in table  [ tab : spectra ] , and the parameters indicate that these sources do indeed have hard spectra , which provides further confirmation that these are the counterparts to the igr sources . for 11 sources ( all except igr j183250756 ) ,",
    "the best fit values for the power - law photon index are between @xmath36 and 1.5 , which is inconsistent with a blackbody spectrum and indicates a hard component to the spectrum . for igr j183250756 ,",
    "only 30 counts were collected , and the spectral shape is not well - constrained as we obtain @xmath37 ( 90% confidence ) .",
    "however , we also obtain a column density of @xmath38 @xmath3 , suggesting that this source may have local absorption like many of the igr sources .",
    "in fact , several of the sources show evidence for local absorption with values of @xmath39 that are significantly higher than the inferred column densities ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) through the galaxy along their lines of sight ( see table  [ tab : spectra ] ) .",
    "in addition to igr  j183250756 , sources igr  j06074 + 2205 , igr  j114356109 , and igr  j182141318 have @xmath39 values of @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 @xmath3 , while the galactic @xmath39 values for these 3 sources are between @xmath44 and @xmath45 @xmath3 @xcite and the galactic @xmath40 values are between @xmath46 and @xmath47  @xmath3 .",

    "chandra _ to the flux levels measured in the 2040  kev band by _ integral _ as reported in @xcite . as the energy bands do not overlap , we compared the fluxes by extrapolating the _ chandra _ power - law spectra into the 2040  kev band .",
    "we note that there is one exception , igr  j06074 + 2205 , which was only detected by _",

    "with the _ chandra _ positions for the 12 igr sources , we searched for optical / ir counterparts in the following catalogs : the 2 micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) ; the deep near infrared survey of the southern sky ( denis ) ; and the united states naval observatory ( usno - b1.0 ) , and the results of the search are given in table  [ tab : oir ] .",
    "for each source , the table lists the 2mass source that is closest to the _ chandra _ position .",

    "less than @xmath0@xmath51 should be considered as possible or likely counterparts . in 11 cases , there are 2mass sources with positions consistent with the _ chandra _ positions , and we consider these associations to be likely . for igr  j182561035 ,",
    "the _ chandra_/2mass separation is @xmath52 , indicating that these two sources are not associated .",
    "figure  [ fig : images_2mass ] shows 2mass @xmath1-band images with the _ chandra _ positions marked for all 12 fields . in the case of igr  j182561035 ( figure  [ fig : images_2mass]j ) , it is apparent that the region is very crowded , and the _ chandra _ source falls in an area where several ir sources are blended together .",
    "the 11 sources with likely 2mass counterparts have a wide range of brightnesses from @xmath53 to @xmath54 .",
    "the brightest of the sources is igr  j113056256 , and this source appears in the 2mass , denis , and usno - b1.0 catalogs at optical and ir magnitudes near 8 .",
    "as discussed below , the very low extinction ( @xmath1@xmath55 ) likely indicates that the source is relatively nearby . on the other hand , igr  j090264812 , which has @xmath56 , shows a highly reddened spectral energy distribution with @xmath1@xmath57 .",
    "either extinction or a very red intrinsic spectrum ( more likely the former ) explain why this source is not detected in the optical ( down to the usno - b1.0 limit ) . although many of the regions are too crowded to comment on whether the sources are extended in the 2mass images or not , figure  [ fig : images_2mass]g shows that igr  j145155542 is clearly extended .",
    "our _ chandra _ position confirms that this source is an agn as suggested by @xcite .",
    "an inspection of the other sources shown in figure  [ fig : images_2mass ] does not suggest that they are extended , and many of the sources that are relatively isolated appear to be point - like .    while we believe that the association of igr  j183250756 with 2mass  j183228280756420 is likely ,",
