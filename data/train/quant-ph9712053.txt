    "things can be more difficult in quantum mechanics , since the connection hamiltonian may not commute with the parts hamiltonians .",
    "this difficulty is avoided by implementing each connection through a form of constructive and destructive interference , assumedly related to particle statistics . by applying reverse engineering , the connection is first introduced as a mathematical feature that would be nice - to - have in quantum mechanisms",
    ". then we ask ourselves whether that feature can be physical .",
    "let us consider the mechanism of fig . 1 from a quantum mechanical perspective .",
    "the connection should establish a constraint between two otherwise independent quantum parts @xmath1 and @xmath2 , with eigenstates @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath6 ( fig .",
    ". the connection state should have the form    @xmath7 we should note that the eigenvalues of each tensor product satisfy the boolean not @xmath0 the constraint ; @xmath8 is free to `` move '' in a two - dimensional hilbert space : this gives the one degree of freedom required from a connection .",
    "let us assume that the connection is temporarily removed .",
    "the generic state of the independent parts are @xmath9 .",
    "the whole unentangled state in the hilbert space of the two qubits @xmath10 is    @xmath11 with @xmath12 , etc .",
    "the connection is restored by projecting @xmath13 on the `` symmetric '' subspace @xmath14 let us define the projector ( or `` symmetry '' ) @xmath15by :    @xmath16    the @xmath17 projection of @xmath13 is the normalized vector of @xmath18 closest to it .",
    "this is obtained ( in a peculiar way whose motivation will be clarified ) by submitting a _ free normalized vector _",
    "@xmath19 of @xmath10 ( whose amplitudes on the basis vectors of @xmath10 are free and independent variables up to normalization ) to the mathematically simultaneous conditions : ( i ) @xmath20 and ( ii ) the distance between the vector before projection @xmath13 and that after projection @xmath8 should be minimum ; in equivalent terms @xmath21 should be maximum .",
    "this yields the usual result @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a renormalization factor , namely an allowed connection state .",
    "the connection will perform by operating on the _ parts _ under continuous @xmath17 projection on @xmath18 of the _ whole_. this will turn out to be the nice - to - have mathematical feature .",
    "to give an introductory example , let us introduce a sort of connection simply related to particle statistics .",
    "let 1 and 2 be two free , identical and non - interacting spin 1/2 particles . at a given time",
    ", their overall spatial wave function is a symmetrical / antisymmetrical linear combination of the spatial wave functions of the two free particles , ( @xmath24and @xmath25 are the particles spatial coordinates ) :    @xmath26 the @xmath27 ( @xmath0 ) sign goes with the spin singlet ( triplet ) state ( normalization is disregarded ) .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath28for the singlet state , and @xmath29for the triplet state , where @xmath30 . thus close ( separated )",
    "particles are more likely to be found in a singlet ( triplet ) state .",
    "there is a sort of connection inducing a correlation between the mutual distance of the two particles and the character of their spin state : in principle , by operating on the distance , the character of the spin state is ( probabilistically ) changed .",
    "noticeably , this kind of connection would fall apart if the two particles were not identical .",
    "the connection of section i is a different case .",
    "it still relies on particle statistics , but under a special interpretation thereof .",
    "a particle statistics symmetry should be seen as the result of continuous projection of the system state on a given symmetrical subspace .",
    "this interpretation can be exemplified by considering a pair of identical bosons labeled 1 and 2 ; @xmath31 is the usual symmetrization projector ; 0/1 stand for , say , horizontal / vertical polarization .",
    "the symmetry @xmath32 is satisfied in @xmath33    there is a common didactic way of introducing this kind of symmetry .",
    "first , statistics is disregarded and the particles are assumed to be independent of each other .",
    "let their _ unentangled _ state at some given time be @xmath34 second , statistics is recovered by symmetrizing @xmath35 , namely by projecting it on @xmath36 .",
    "we take this didactic procedure seriously : particle statistics is interpreted as the result of _ projection of the system state on a predetermined hilbert subspace _ , the one which satisfies the symmetry .",
    "this amounts to considering the equation @xmath37 as a _ constraint _ applied to @xmath38 .",
    "when a particle statistics symmetry is an initial condition conserved as a constant of motion , this constraint is redundant .",
    "however , the notion of connection will be related to particle statistics by means of a counterfactual reasoning based on eq .",
    "the idea is that @xmath39 , symmetrical at time @xmath40 , _ could _ be pushed out of symmetry at time @xmath41 ; but in this case eq . ( 1 ) would `` immediately '' project it on @xmath36 back again .",
    "particle statistics would operate like a watch - dog effect internal to the endosystem , or like destructive and constructive interference , by killing the amplitudes of those eigenstates of @xmath42 which violate the symmetry , and reinforcing the other amplitudes through re - normalization .",
    "this can also be seen as a continuous form of partial state vector reduction on a symmetrical subspace .    to see why @xmath38 could be `` pushed out of symmetry '' , we must consider the system defined in section i and the @xmath43 symmetrization projector . in a first step , @xmath17 projection is disregarded while parts @xmath1 and @xmath2 are assumed to be independent of each other .",
    "an operation on part @xmath1 could well push the overall state @xmath44 out of symmetry , but in a second step this is prevented by the continuous projection of @xmath45 on @xmath18 : @xmath46    we should note that this projection ( or , if one prefers , partial state vector reduction on a predetermined subspace ) will in general alter the entanglement between the parts @xmath1 and @xmath2 , thus the coherence elements of @xmath47 ( part @xmath1 density matrix ) .",
    "however , it does not alter the diagonal of @xmath48 ; this is determined by the operation performed on part @xmath1 , namely it is a constraint that should be satisfied by projection .",
    "we go back to the connection @xmath1,@xmath2 defined in section i , and consider an operation performed on just one qubit , say , @xmath49 let this be the continuous rotation @xmath50 , with @xmath51 and time @xmath40 ranging from @xmath52 to @xmath53 .",
    "we shall examine the effect of applying @xmath54 to qubit @xmath1 ,    @xmath55    _ under continuous _",
    "projection _ of the overall state .",
    "let the connection initial state be the `` symmetrical '' state ( whose tensor products satisfy symmetry @xmath17 ) :    @xmath56    the successive states are obtained by submitting a free normalized vector @xmath57 of the hilbert space @xmath10 ( section i ) to the following _ mathematically simultaneous _ conditions ,    _ for all t or _",

    "the distance between the vectors before and after projection must be minimum . in the case of continuous projection",
    ", @xmath65 must be maximized orderly for @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , where @xmath71 ; then the limit for @xmath72 should be taken ( however , maximization ordering turns out to be irrelevant here ) .",
    "\\(i ) and ( ii ) yield @xmath73 with @xmath74 unconstrained , as can be checked ; condition ( iii ) , given the initial state ( 3 ) , sets @xmath75 , yielding to the unitary evolution :    @xmath76    this makes a `` good '' connection .",
    "the rotation of qubit @xmath1 is identically transmitted to the other qubit @xmath2 .",
    "in fact    @xmath77    of course eigenvalues 0 and 1 are interchanged : one qubit is the not  of the other .",
    "noticeably , by simultaneously rotating also the other extremity @xmath2 of the connection by the same amount , the same result ( 4 ) is obtained .",
    "this means adding eq .",
    "( 5 ) as a condition , but this is redundant with respect to ( i ) and ( ii ) , it was derived from ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "whereas , two different rotations of the two connection extremities give an impossible mathematical system ; this resembles a rigid classical connection .",
    "it should be noted that a rotation @xmath58 of qubit ( part ) @xmath1 under @xmath43 projection , is equivalent to applying the unitary operator @xmath78 to @xmath38 :    @xmath79 , with @xmath80    @xmath81 brings from @xmath82 ( 3 ) to @xmath38 ( 4 ) without ever violating @xmath17 .",
    "we have thus ascertained a peculiar fact .",
    "our operation on a part , _ blind _ to its effect on the whole , performed together with continuous @xmath17 projection , generates a _ unitary _ _ transformation _ which is , so to speak , _ wise _ to the whole state , to how it should be transformed without violating @xmath17 .",

    "part _ of the input and _ part _ of the output , and asking whether this network admits a solution .",
    "let @xmath87 and @xmath88 be such constraints . @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) propagates a _ conditional _ logical implication from left to right ( right to left ) .",
    "logical implication is conditioned by the values of the unconstrained part of the input ( output ) . to have a solution ,",
    "the two propagations must be matched , i.e. they must generate a univocal set of values on all the nodes of the network .",
    "finding whether the network admits at least one match ( one solution ) is an np - complete problem .",
    "possible collisions ( mismatch ) between the two propagations will be both overcome and reconciled by the connection .",
    "let us assume that the network has just one solution ( which is the case here : @xmath89",
    "@xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath88 ) .",

    "2b each wire is a connection ) .",
    "the output constraint is removed while an arbitrary value , here @xmath66 , is assigned to the unconstrained part of the input .",
    "the logical propagation of this input toward the output yields @xmath66 , @xmath87 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 ( @xmath95 will be disregarded ) .",

    "thus @xmath114    for @xmath115 , one obtains @xmath116 , namely the solution .",

    "it is obtained by `` blindly '' operating on _ divided parts _ of the network , but under @xmath17 projection / s ( the _ conquering _ factor ) .",
    "the evolution is always unitary because an infinitesimal rotation of @xmath117 , under conditions ( i ) through ( iv ) , yields a univocal ( unitary ) vector .",

    "@xmath17 symmetries ( or projectors ) become constants of motion which commute with the network propagator at all times .",

    "which one , depends on the network initial state through condition ( iv ) .",
    "however measurement gives one solution ( that it is a solution is checkable in polynomial time ) .",
    "it is clear from the above that connections `` cut '' network complexity , inducing a divide - and - conquer strategy .",
    "this diakoptic approach would make np - complete @xmath119 p. however , we have applied reverse engineering until now .",
    "the @xmath17 projections are just a nice - to - have feature .",

    "we assume that each fermion has two compatible , binary degrees of freedom @xmath121 and @xmath122 . just for the sake of visualization ( things can remain more abstract ) , we can think that each fermion is a spin @xmath123 particle which can occupy one of either two sites of a spatial lattice .",
    "@xmath124 thus becomes the particle spin component @xmath125 @xmath126 and @xmath127 the label of the site occupied by the particle .",
    "for example , @xmath128 reads : @xmath125 of particle 1 down ( 0 ) , @xmath125 of particle 2 up ( 1 ) , site of particle @xmath129 site of particle @xmath130 .",
    "the following is the list of the states which do not violate statistics ; they make up the basis of the hilbert space @xmath131 .",

    "the distance between the vectors before and after reduction must be minimum , as specified in section iii ;    1 .   the expected connection energy : @xmath161 must be minimum .",
    "since this minimum will always be _ zero _ , time ordering is irrelevant .",
    "it is readily seen that the solution of this system is still @xmath57 of eq .",
    "( 4 ) : @xmath76 simultaneous satisfaction of ( i ) , i.e. fermionic antisymmetry seen as projection , and ( iv ) ( which is satisfied by @xmath162 ) originates the projection @xmath163 , as is readily seen .",
    "therefore , if @xmath164 , namely if the operation on qubit @xmath1 is performed _ adiabatically _ , we obtain the connection .    since this computation is _",
    "reversible_@xmath165 } $ ] _ , _ namely it does not dissipate free energy ( the result of _ driving and shaping _ is a unitary evolution ) , in principle @xmath166 can always be zero .",
    "this is of course an idealization , for the time being we are highlighting a possible , speculative way of dealing with np - complete problems .    by the way we should note that the tensor products @xmath167 and @xmath168 that would be projected off since they violate particle statistics ( section ii ) , are _ not _ the antisymmetrical excited states @xmath169 and @xmath170 , which satisfy @xmath171 .",
    "they would be instead the symmetrical states @xmath172 the two kinds of states ( antisymmetrical and symmetrical ) have the same qubit notations and density matrices .",
    "we are of course in counterfactual reasoning ; the important thing is that conditions ( i ) through ( iv ) yield the solution ( 4 ) .",
    "let us now address the problem of creating many connections , namely an @xmath173 hamiltonian per network wire @xmath174 ( fig .",
