    "over the last 20 years a standard neutrino oscillation framework associated with small splittings between the @xmath12 mass states has become well established .",
    "the three @xmath12 flavors ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) are mixtures of three massive neutrinos ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) separated by squared mass differences of @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "this is a minimal extension of the standard model that requires a lepton mixing matrix , similarly to the quark sector .    beyond this model , indications of oscillations between active and sterile @xmath21",
    "have been observed in lsnd @xcite , miniboone @xcite , gallium @xcite and more recently by reactor experiments @xcite .",
    "this suggests the possible existence of a fourth massive @xmath22 with a mass of @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "both the reactor and gallium anomalies result from the observation of the disappearance of mev energy @xmath24 and @xmath25 in counting experiments .",
    "therefore , to definitivively test the anomalies one must not only test neutrino disappearance at short baselines , but also search for an oscillation pattern as a function of @xmath26 energy and baseline - dependent signatures . probing @xmath27 values on the order of 0.1 to a few ev@xmath6 implies that an oscillation search using neutrinos with energies of typical of radioactive decays , i.e. in the few mev range , requires a baseline of only several meters . assuming cp invariance",
    ", both gallium and reactor anomalies can be unambiguously tested using a neutrino emitter placed inside or next to a large 10-meter scale liquid scintillator detector , such as borexino , kamland , sno+ , or daya bay .",
    "this constitutes an elegant method to probe the existence of oscillations into a 4@xmath1 neutrino by using a well - known neutrino detector .",
    "there are two options for deploying intense @xmath22 emitters in large liquid scintillator detectors : monochromatic @xmath24 emitters , like @xmath28 or @xmath29 , or @xmath25 emitters with continuous @xmath30-spectra , like @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 or @xmath34 . in the case of @xmath13",
    "emitters the signature is provided by @xmath24 elastic scattering off electrons in the liquid scintillator molecules .",
    "this signature can be mimicked by compton scattering induced by radioactivity or cosmogenic background , or by solar-@xmath22 s .",
    "the constraints of an experiment with @xmath24 impose the use of a very high activity source @xmath35 10 mci outside of the detector target . in the case of @xmath25",
    ", events are detected via the inverse beta decay reaction ( ibd ) , which provides a @xmath36-n delayed coincidence that offers an efficient rejection of the mentioned background .",
    "for this reason , we focus our studies on @xmath25 sources in the current proposal .    based on the concept presented in 2011 in @xcite , the celand collaboration intends to use an intense @xmath37 source decaying into the unstable daughter @xmath38 which , in turn , decays into stable @xmath39 with a q - value of 2.996  mev .",
    "the @xmath38 decay produces antineutrinos above the 1.8  mev threshold for the inverse beta decay reaction .",
    "the half - life of @xmath37 is 285 days , and that of its daughter @xmath38 is only 17.3 minutes , so that the latter decay remains in equilibrium at all times .",
    "this thus leaves a significant amount of time for the source production , its transportation to the detector , and the data taking , without significant decrease in its initial activity .    the intense @xmath40 antineutrino generator ( ang hereafter )",
    "can be produced at the federal state unitary enterprise mayak production association ( fsue -mayak- pa or simply mayak ) reprocessing plant in russia as early as 2014 .",
    "the source will then be transported within one month to the kamioka mine , japan , where the kamland detector is located .",
    "the celand collaboration intends to deploy a 75 - 100 kci ( 2.78 - 3.73 pbq ) antineutrino generator within 13 m of the kamland detector center , as early as 2015 .",
    "the plan is to take data for at least 18 months and to search for a fourth neutrino .",
    "if a hint of oscillation is observed , the collaboration would consider deploying the source at the center of the detector , or procuring a second antineutrino generator to increase the statistical power of the experiment .",
    "such deployment strategy allows a comprehensive test of the electron disappearance neutrino anomalies and could lead to the discovery of a 4@xmath1 neutrino state for @xmath2 @xmath3 and sin@xmath4",
    "neutrino oscillations have been observed in solar , atmospheric , and long - baseline reactor and accelerator experiments . for a detailed review ,",
    "see for example @xcite .",
    "the data collected so far by these experiments are well fitted in the framework of a three - neutrino mixing approach , in which the three known flavor neutrinos @xmath24 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are unitary linear combinations of three massive neutrinos @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 with squared - mass differences and mixing angles @xcite :      besides this well - established picture , there are a few anomalies which could point toward short - baseline ( sbl ) neutrino oscillations generated by a larger squared - mass difference : the gallium radioactive source experiment anomalies @xcite , the recently observed reactor antineutrino anomaly @xcite , and the miniboone @xcite and lsnd @xcite accelerator neutrino anomalies .",
    "existence of a fourth yet unobserved neutrino species is not ruled out by cosmological data obtained by planck @xcite and wmap @xcite . in this section",
    ", we successively review these anomalies and give an up - to - date interpretation in terms of light sterile neutrinos .",
    "man - made neutrino sources were originally proposed and designed to test solar-@xmath22 detection in the gallex @xcite and sage @xcite experiments .",
    "intense mega curie ( mci ) @xmath50 and @xmath51 @xmath24 sources with precisely measured activities were placed at the center of the detectors to count for the number of @xmath24 events , as a tool to understand the detector responses .",
    "taking into account the uncertainty of the cross - section of the detection process @xmath52 , the ratios r of measured to predicted @xmath53 event rates reported by the experiments          the number of measured events is smaller than the prediction at the 2.7@xmath56 level , leading to the so - called gallium anomaly .",
    "although the cross - section of the @xmath52 detection process might have been overestimated by adding the uncertain transitions from the ground state of @xmath57 to two excited states of @xmath53 , the anomaly still remains at the 1.8@xmath56 level in the absence of such transitions , with a ratio @xmath58 .",
    "recently , a re - interpretation of the gallium data with new measurements of the gamow - teller strengths of the transitions from the ground state of @xmath57 to the two excited states of @xmath53 confirmed the anomaly at the 3@xmath56 level @xcite .",
    "nuclear reactors emit @xmath59 through @xmath60 decay of fission products .",
    "any reactor antineutrino spectrum is mostly the sum of the neutrino spectra of the four fissioning nuclei ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) weighted by their relative fission rate .",
    "since thousands of different @xmath65 branches are available to the unstable fission products , and many of them are still unknown , neutrino spectra predictions can not fully rely on simulations .",
    "neutrino spectra are then estimated by converting the precise measurement of the total electron spectrum emitted by nuclear fuel under neutron irradiation , using energy conservation law .",
    "however , some modeling , such as of the end point distribution of the beta branches , still remain necessary .    in 2011 , a revised calculation of the rate of @xmath59 production by nuclear reactors yielded yet another indication of the hypothetical existence of a fourth neutrino species .",
    "the new calculation relies on detailed knowledge of the decays of thousands of fission products listed by nuclear databases @xcite , while the previous calculation used a phenomenological model based on 30 effective @xmath30-branches .",
    "the revised rate of @xmath59 production by nuclear reactors is 3.5% higher than previously thought and was confirmed independently by another calculation @xcite .",
    "this new calculation motivated a re - analysis of 19 past reactor experiments at reactor distances < 100 m. figure [ fig : raa - picture ] shows the ratio of measured - to - expected @xmath59 count rates in each of these experiments , following the revised calculation of the rate of @xmath59 production by nuclear reactors combined with a new estimation of the inverse @xmath65 decay cross - section ( driven by the neutron life - time measurement ) and off - equilibrium corrections to the reactor fuel composition .",
    "along with these new ratios are also displayed the results of middle - baseline experiments ( l > 100 m ) such as chooz @xcite or palo verde @xcite .",
    "the dotted line represents a `` classic '' three active neutrinos mixing scheme .",
    "the solid line shows a ( 3 + 1 ) sterile neutrino model . a constant fit to the 19 sbl experiments measured - over - expected @xmath25 count rates gives a mean ratio of @xmath66 , corresponding to a 3@xmath56 discrepancy called the reactor antineutrino anomaly ( raa)@xcite . the sbl reactor data suggests a new @xmath67 if interpreted in terms of a new sbl oscillation driven by a @xmath68 neutrino state .",
    "re - analysis of the past reactor antineutrino experiments , which indicates an anomaly in the expected measured - to - predicted count rates of @xmath25 at short distances .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the classic three - neutrino picture with the squared mass differences quoted above .",
    "the solid line corresponds to a 3 active neutrinos plus one sterile neutrino ( 3 + 1 ) model . ]",
    "the lsnd experiment was designed to search for @xmath69 oscillations at short distances and ran at the los alamos 800 mev proton accelerator , producing @xmath70 up to 300 mev by @xmath71 decay at rest @xcite .",
    "the lsnd detector was placed 30 m away from the @xmath70 source and the detection process of @xmath59 relied on the inverse @xmath65 decay reaction @xmath72 . using the data collected between 1993 and 1998 , the collaboration reported evidence for @xmath70 oscillations at the 3.8@xmath56 level , with a total excess of 87.9 @xmath73 22.4 @xmath73 6.0 events consistent with the @xmath72 reaction above the expected background @xcite . in conjunction with other known neutrino limits , the lsnd data suggest that the observed neutrino oscillations occur in the 0.2 - 10 @xmath74 @xmath75 range , leading to the lsnd anomaly .",
    "miniboone is an appearance experiment which ran at fermilab between 2002 and 2012 .",
    "it has been searching for a @xmath76 and @xmath77 oscillation signal in the lsnd @xmath78 range @xcite .",
    "the experiment uses the fermilab booster neutrino beam , which produces @xmath41 ( @xmath79 ) with energies up to 3 gev with a 8 gev proton beam hitting a beryllium target .",
    "the center of the detector is 541 m away from the neutrino source , and the @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) detection process relies on quasi - elastic charged - current scattering on nucleons @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( ccqe ) . in 2007 ,",
    "the miniboone collaboration released its first results and showed no evidence of @xmath82 oscillations for neutrino energies above 475 mev @xcite .",
    "however in their second publication @xcite , the collaboration reported a sizable excess of 83.7 @xmath73 15.1 @xmath73 19.3 electron - like events for neutrino energies between 300 mev and 475 mev , corresponding to a significance of 3.4@xmath56 . in the antineutrino mode",
    ", miniboone observes an excess of 24.7 @xmath73 18.0 events in the 475 < @xmath83 < 3000 mev energy range , which is consistent with the antineutrino oscillations suggested by the lsnd data @xcite . finally , a combined analysis of the data collected in the neutrino and antineutrino mode recently showed an excess of 240.3 @xmath73 34.5 @xmath73 52.6 events , updating the significance to 3.8@xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the combined dataset favors @xmath27 in the 0.01 - 1 ev@xmath6 range .",
    "cosmological data can also be used to test the sterile neutrino hypothesis because the universe expansion rate is sensitive to the energy density in relativistic particles during the radiation domination era @xcite :        @xmath87 @xmath88 could be interpreted as the effective number of neutrino species .",
    "it is equal to 3.046 in the standard model of cosmology with three generations of fermions .",
    "the extra energy density of neutrinos with respect to @xmath89 comes from qed and non - instantaneous decoupling effects in the calculation of the neutrino temperature @xmath90 . from a particle physics perspective ,",
    "a sterile neutrino that mixes with active neutrinos can increase the relativistic energy density in the early universe through oscillation - based thermal production , leading to a @xmath91 . with @xmath85 being extremely well determined from measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature , constraints on h(t ) in the early universe",
    "can be then interpreted as bounds on @xmath86 and hence on @xmath88 .",
    "various cosmological observables can be used to search for signatures of sterile neutrinos .",

    "the recent planck result leads to @xmath92 at 95% c.l . if no additional constraint are being used@xcite . however including the astrophysical constraints on the hubble constant measurement this results shifts to @xmath93 at 95% c.l .",
    "therefore @xmath91 is mildly disfavored but this cosmological bound is still model dependent .",
