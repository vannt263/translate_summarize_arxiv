    "in this document we present details of our monte carlo algorithm and additional results from our simulations which support the key findings highlighted in the main text .",
    "to simulate the system of dimers and squares on the square lattice , we use the following transfer - matrix based monte carlo algorithm which is a variant of the technique developed in refs .",
    "our variant is designed to ensure that we can work directly in the full - packing limit if needed . in our scheme ,",
    "we update all objects fully contained in a @xmath170 track ( two adjacent rows / columns of plaquettes ) at once , with the correct weights in the partition function .",
    "the steps involved in each update are as follows :    * we empty out all objects that are fully contained within a randomly chosen @xmath171 track ( horizontal or vertical ) . * the remaining objects either lie outside the chosen track ( this includes objects which share an edge with the long boundary of the track ) or protrude partially into the track . the latter class of objects , which protrude partially into the track , provide excluded - volume constraints that need to be respected when the track is refilled . * to refill the track with objects lying entirely within the track , we compute the partition function of the track subject to the constraints imposed by objects that protrude into the track .",
    "this is done using a standard transfer matrix technique . * using this partition function , we generate a configuration with the correct botzmann weight consistent with the constraints , and re - populate the track .",
    "we summarize these steps in fig .",

    "the track is re - populated with a new configuration of objects lying entirely within the track , subject to the excluded volume constraints imposed by objects protruding into the track.,title=\"fig : \" ]    to evaluate the weights of the allowed configurations for the purpose of refilling a track , we need to calculate the restricted partition function of this track subject to constraints imposed by objects protruding into the track .",
    "we do this by using a standard transfer matrix technique .",
    "below we provide details of this update for a horizontal track .",
    "we break up the track into a sequence of two - plaquette `` rungs '' , defined as two vertically adjacent plaquettes . after the track is emptied of all objects lying completely within it , these rungs still have areas covered by objects protruding into the track from above and below ( as shown in * 2 .",
    "[ update_fig ] ) .",
    "these protrusions preclude the occupation of some objects on the rung , and thereby provide constraints on which objects can be re - populated .",
    "the four possible types of protrusions ( represented by shaded areas ) on a given rung are shown in fig .",
    "[ rung_blocks_fig ] . based on this",

    "@xmath173 corresponds to a complete blockade.,title=\"fig : \" ]    next , in order to fill the rung with objects , we focus on the `` state '' @xmath174 of a rung , the ways in which objects can be placed on this rung . when the underlying morphology is ignored , there are * six * possible ways of filling a two - plaquette rung , as shown in fig .",
    "[ states_fig ] .",
    "* 1 . *",
    "to unambiguously assign objects to each rung , we use the convention that objects are on the rung , if their left edge coincides with the left edge of the rung ( represented by open circles in fig .",
    "[ states_fig ] ) .",
    "our convention is also designed to ensure that the allowed states are influenced _ only _ by the morphology of the given rung and the one immediately to the right . when the underlying morphology is considered , not all states are allowed .",
    "for example , state @xmath175 is disallowed if the morphology of the rung is @xmath176 , the state @xmath177 is disallowed if the morphology of the rung or of the rung immediately to the right is @xmath178 , and so on .",
    "we next construct the partition function of the track subject to these constraints and also the excluded volume constraints provided by the objects on the track .",
    "our transfer matrix formalism transfers the state of a two - plaquette rung to the next two - plaquette rung to its _ left _ , subject to these constraints .",
    "so , let @xmath179 be the partition function of an @xmath70-rung track , where the leftmost rung is filled with the state @xmath180 , and has an underlying morphology @xmath181 .",
    "then , the partition function of the @xmath182-rung track , @xmath183 is given by the recursion relation : @xmath184 where @xmath185 is a @xmath186 transfer matrix , consistent with the excluded volume constraints of @xmath174 and @xmath180 and also with the constraints provided by the underlying morphology @xmath187 .",
    "we therefore have 16 possible transfer matrices , based on these indices @xmath187 .",
    "however , we note that if there is a complete disruption in the track ( @xmath173 ) , the partition function of the track breaks up into a product over partition functions of open chains .",
    "we deal with these cases separately since , as we show later , the computational cost is greatly reduced in this case .",
    "* .,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ] + .,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ] + .,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ]    hence , based on the possible combinations @xmath188 ( shown in fig .",
    "[ transfer_possibilities_fig ] ) , there are * nine * possible transfer matrices .",
    "we list them below :    @xmath189    @xmath190    @xmath191    it is useful to note that our convention of assigning objects to the rungs , leads to factors of @xmath15 appearing asymmetrically in various entries of the transfer matrices . for example @xmath192 , since this leaves a vacancy at the bottom of the rung transfered from .",
    "if there are no complete blockades on the track , the partition function is that of a closed chain given by @xmath193 where @xmath89 is the size of the lattice and the matrices @xmath194 are chosen according to the underlying morphology as described above . here",
    "@xmath195 .",
    "if one or more of the rungs on the track is completely blocked ( @xmath173 ) , then the partition function of the track is given by a product of partition functions of open chains .",
    "for an open chain where @xmath196 consecutive rungs are allowed for occupation , the partition function is given by @xmath197 where @xmath198 and @xmath199 represent the morphology of the first and @xmath200-th rung respectively .",
    "the three right vectors are given by ( formally @xmath201 ) @xmath202 and the three left vectors are given by ( formally @xmath203 ) @xmath204      in order to choose a new configuration of objects on this track , we use the following recursive technique .",
    "for an open chain , the state @xmath205 of the leftmost rung is chosen with the probability @xmath206 where @xmath207 are the standard @xmath208 basis vectors . given this state @xmath207 of the leftmost rung , the state @xmath209 of the next rung to the right ,",
    "is then chosen with the probability @xmath210 where @xmath211 , acts as the new left vector .",
    "we can then recursively populate the entire track using this procedure .",
    "clearly , starting from a given right vector @xmath212 depending on the morphology of the rightmost rung , one only needs to store the partial products @xmath213 , of @xmath208 vectors at each rung in this algorithm .      for a closed chain ,",
    "the state @xmath214 of the first rung is chosen with the probability @xmath215 given this state @xmath216 of the first rung , the state @xmath217 of the next rung to the right is then chosen with the probability @xmath218 and similarly for the rest of the chain ( as for the open chain ) , until the entire track is filled .",
    "thus , in the case of a closed chain , one needs to store the partial products of @xmath186 matrices at each rung .",
    "* a. *   periodic lattice * a. * at full - packing * b. * for a general @xmath219 ( normalized by its weight in the partition function ) . all states are sampled with a frequency approaching @xmath8 as the number of monte carlo steps ( mcs ) are increased.,title=\"fig : \" ] * b. *   periodic lattice * a. * at full - packing * b. * for a general @xmath219 ( normalized by its weight in the partition function ) .",
    "all states are sampled with a frequency approaching @xmath8 as the number of monte carlo steps ( mcs ) are increased.,title=\"fig : \" ]    we note that the algorithm described above _ does not reject _ any configurations .",
    "this is particularly useful when studying high density phases , where local algorithms often encounter `` jamming '' .",
    "this algorithm is naturally extendable to updates of wider tracks , where the size and the number of the transfer matrices grows with the number of rows / columns considered .",
    "we also note that this algorithm is quite computationally efficient . for large lattice sizes and high densities ,",
    "the probability of encountering a periodic track falls rapidly . to update a single open track , only storage of order @xmath220 numbers",
    "is required in an @xmath13 system . in the rare cases when we encounter a periodic track , we need storage of order @xmath221 to update it",
    "naturally , the rarity of periodic tracks also implies that the algorithm does not change winding sectors ( defined exactly as in the usual dimer model ) easily for a large system .",
    "this is in principle a draw - back compared to loop algorithms or pocket - algorithms , both of which can be readily generalized for use in the present problem , and may change sectors more easily ( we have not explored this in any detail ) .    in our simulations , we always start in the zero - winding sector , and our results for the larger values of @xmath89 shown in the main text are therefore averages over the zero - winding sector .",
    "however , as is well - known in the context of interacting dimer models , the restriction to zero - winding in the microscopic model simply corresponds to periodic boundary conditions for the coarse - grained heights .",
    "therefore , it does not change our conclusions .",
    "finally , we note that a full monte - carlo sweep , requiring us to randomly choose @xmath222 different tracks and update their interior configurations , requires of order @xmath223 operations , making the time required comparable to that of other available schemes , while being rejection - free .",
    "since the new configurations are chosen with the correct weights from the `` restricted '' partition function , this algorithm trivially satisfies the detailed balance criterion .",
    "the question of ergodicity is more subtle . to check that the algorithm samples all available states of the system",
    ", we have performed the following numerical check .",
    "we enumerate all possible states on a @xmath224 lattice with periodic boundary conditions . for the full - packing case ( no vacancies )",
    ", there are @xmath225 possible configurations of squares and dimers . using this explicit knowledge of all the states , we monitor the frequency with which each state is sampled in our simulations .",
    "we choose activities such that all fully - packed states have unit boltzmann weight and states with vacancies have zero weight . in this case",
    ", we have checked that for a large enough number of monte carlo steps , all allowed states are sampled with equal frequency .",
    "in addition we have checked that the variance of this frequency decreases as @xmath226 , where @xmath227 represents the number of monte carlo steps .",
    "in fig . [ frequency_fig ] * a*. we plot this frequency table for different numbers of monte carlo samplings .",
    "we have also enumerated all possible states for this small sample when @xmath219 . in this case",
    "there are @xmath228 configurations of dimers , squares and vacancies available to the system .",
    "we check explicitly that each one of these states is sampled with the correct probability given by @xmath229 where @xmath230 and @xmath231 are the number of dimers and vacancies in the configuration @xmath232 , and @xmath233 and @xmath234 are the number of dimers and vacancies in the configuration @xmath235 .",
    "the sum is over all possible configurations of the system . in fig .",
    "[ frequency_fig ] * b*. , we plot the frequency of the occurrence of each of the @xmath228 configurations in our simulations , normalized by the above probability .",
    "we find that the normalized frequency of each of these states converges to @xmath8 , confirming the ergodicity of our algorithm ( for small lattice sizes ) .",
    "finally , we use our monte carlo update scheme to perform large scale simulations on the lattice gas of dimers and squares on the square lattice . recent simulations of the hard - square lattice gas have shown the necessity of simulations on large system sizes to fully understand the nature of scaling in such hard - core systems with columnar ordering @xcite .",
    "the columnar ordered state is relatively unstable to the presence of vacancies , as compared to sublattice ordering , and is characterised by large correlation lengths .",
