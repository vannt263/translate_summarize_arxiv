    "the us power grid has been recognized as the most important engineering achievement of the 20th century  @xcite , yet it presently faces major challenges related to efficiency , reliability , security , environmental impact , sustainability , and market diversity issues  @xcite .",
    "the crystallizing vision of the smart grid ( sg ) aspires to build a cyber - physical network that can address these challenges by capitalizing on state - of - the - art information technologies in sensing , control , communication , optimization , and machine learning .",
    "significant effort and investment are being committed to architect the necessary infrastructure by installing advanced metering systems , and establishing data communication networks throughout the grid .",
    "accordingly , algorithms that optimally exploit the pervasive sensing and control capabilities of the envisioned advanced metering infrastructure ( ami ) are needed to make the necessary breakthroughs in the key problems in power grid monitoring and energy management .",
    "this is no easy endeavor though , in view of the challenges posed by increasingly distributed network operations under strict reliability requirements , also facing malicious cyber - attacks .",
    "_ statistical inference _ techniques are expected to play an increasingly instrumental role in power system monitoring  @xcite , not only to meet the anticipated  big data \" deluge as the installed base of phasor measurement units ( pmus ) reaches out throughout the grid , but also to robustify the monitoring tasks against the  outlier \" effects owing to faulty readings , malicious attacks , and communication errors , as well as against missing data due to privacy concerns and technical anomalies  @xcite . in this context , a _ load cleansing and imputation _ scheme is developed in this paper , building on recent advances in sparsity - cognizant information processing  @xcite , low - rank matrix completion  @xcite , and large - scale distributed optimization  @xcite .",
    "_ load curve _ data refers to the electric energy consumption periodically recorded by meters at points of interest across the power grid , e.g. , end - user premises , buses , and substations .",
    "accurate load profiles are critical assets aiding operational decisions in the envisioned sg system  @xcite , and are essential for load forecasting  @xcite . however , in the process of acquiring and transmitting such massive volumes of information for centralized processing , data are oftentimes corrupted or lost altogether . in a smart monitoring context for instance ,",
    "incomplete load profiles emerge due to three reasons : ( r1 ) pmu - instrumented buses are few ; ( r2 ) scada data become available at a considerably smaller time scale than pmu data ; and ( r3 ) regional operators are not willing to share all their variables @xcite .",
    "moreover , a major requirement for grid monitoring is robustness to outliers , i.e. , data not adhering to nominal models  @xcite .",
    "sources of so - termed `` bad data '' include meter failures , as well as strikes , unscheduled generator shutdowns , and extreme weather conditions  @xcite .",
    "inconsistent data can also be due to malicious ( cyber- ) attacks that induce abrupt load changes , or counterfeit meter readings  @xcite .    in light of the aforementioned observations ,",
    "the first contribution of this paper is on modeling spatiotemporal load profiles , accounting for the structure present to effectively impute missing data and devise robust load curve estimators stemming from convex optimization criteria ( section [ sec : prob_state ] ) .",
    "existing approaches to load curve cleansing have relied on separate processing per time series  @xcite , and have not capitalized on spatial correlations to improve performance .",
    "the aim is for _ minimal - rank _ cleansed load data , while also exploiting outlier _",
    "sparsity _ across buses and time .",
    "an estimator tailored to these specifications is principal components pursuit ( pcp )  @xcite , which is outlined in section [ sec : pcp ] .",
    "pcp minimizes a tradeoff between the least - squares ( ls ) model fitting error and a twofold sparsity - promoting regularization , implemented through an @xmath0-norm of the outliers and the nuclear norm of the nominal load profiles .",
    "while pcp has been widely adopted in computer vision  @xcite , for voice separation in music  @xcite , and unveiling network anomalies  @xcite , its benefits to power systems engineering and monitoring remains so far largely unexplored .",
    "the second contribution pertains to developing a _ distributed _ ( d- )",
    "pcp algorithm , to carry out the imputation and cleansing task using a network of interconnected devices as part of the ami ( section [ sec : dist ] ) .",
    "this is possible by leveraging a general algorithmic framework for sparsity - regularized rank minimization put forth in @xcite . upon recasting the ( non - separable ) nuclear norm present in the pcp cost into a form amenable to decentralized optimization ( section [ ssec : separable ] ) ,",
    "the d - pcp iterations are obtained in section [ ssec : ad_mom ] via the multi - block alternating - directions method of multipliers ( admm ) solver  @xcite . in a nutshell , per iteration each smart meter exchanges simple messages with its ( directly connected ) neighbors in the network , and then solves its own optimization problem to refine its current estimate of the cleansed load profile . in the context of power systems , the admm has been recently adopted to carry out dynamic network energy management  @xcite , and distributed robust state estimation  @xcite .",
    "computer simulations corroborate the convergence and optimality of the novel d - pcp algorithm , and demonstrate its effectiveness in cleansing and imputing real load curve data ( section [ sec : sims ] ) .",
    "concluding remarks and directions for future research are outlined in section [ sec : conc ] , while a few algorithmic details are deferred to the appendix .",
    "this section introduces the model for ( possibly ) incomplete and grossly corrupted load curve measurements , acquired by geographically - distributed metering devices monitoring the power grid .",
    "the communication network model needed to account for exchanges of information among smart meters is described as well .",
    "lastly , the task of load curve cleansing and imputation is formally stated .",
    "let the @xmath1 vector @xmath2'$ ] ( @xmath3 stands for transposition ) collect the spatial load profiles measured by smart meters monitoring @xmath4 network nodes ( buses , residential premises ) , at a given discrete - time instant @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "consider the @xmath6 matrix of observations @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "the @xmath8-th row @xmath9 of @xmath10 is the time series of energy consumption ( load curve ) measurements at node @xmath8 , while the @xmath11-th column @xmath12 of @xmath13 represents a snapshot of the networkwide loads taken at time @xmath11 . to model missing data ,",
    "consider the set @xmath14 of index pairs @xmath15 defining a sampling of the entries of @xmath10 .",
    "introducing the matrix sampling operator @xmath16 , which sets the entries of its matrix argument not indexed by @xmath17 to zero and leaves the rest unchanged , the ( possibly ) incomplete spatiotemporal load curve data in the presence of outliers can be modeled as @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 denote the nominal load profiles , the outliers , and small measurement errors , respectively . for nominal observations @xmath22 ,",
    "one has @xmath23 .",

    "estimation of @xmath25 from @xmath26 is an ill - posed problem unless one introduces extra structural assumptions on the model components to reduce the effective degrees of freedom . to this end",
    ", two cardinal properties of @xmath19 and @xmath20 will prove instrumental .",
    "first , common temporal patterns among the energy consumption of a few broad classes of loads ( e.g. , industrial , residential , seasonal ) in addition to their ( almost ) periodic behaviors render most rows and columns of @xmath19 linearly dependent , and thus @xmath19 typically has _ low - rank_. second , outliers ( or attacks ) only occur sporadically in time and affect only a few buses , yielding a _ sparse _ matrix @xmath20 . smoothness of the nominal load curves is related to the low - rank property of @xmath19 , which was adopted in  @xcite to motivate a smoothing splines - based algorithm for cleansing .",
    "however , while in  @xcite smoothness was enforced per load profile time - series , i.e. , per row @xmath27 of @xmath28 ; the low - rank property of @xmath19 also captures the spatial dependencies introduced by the network .",
    "approaches capitalizing on outlier- and `` bad data- '' sparsity can be found in e.g. ,  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "suppose that on top of the energy measurement functionality , the @xmath4 networked smart meters are capable of performing simple local computations , as well as exchanging messages among directly connected neighbors .",
    "single - hop communication models are appealing due to their simplicity , since one does not have to incur the routing overhead .",
    "the ami network is naturally abstracted to an undirected graph @xmath29 , where the vertex set @xmath30 corresponds to the network nodes , and the edges ( links ) in @xmath31 represent pairs of nodes that are connected via a physical communication channel .",
    "node @xmath32 communicates with its single - hop neighboring peers in @xmath33 , and the size of the neighborhood will be henceforth denoted by @xmath34 .",
    "the graph @xmath35 is assumed connected , i.e. , there exists a ( possibly multihop ) path that joins any pair of nodes in the network .",
    "this requirement ensures that the network is devoid of multiple isolated ( connected ) components , and allows for the data collected by e.g. , smart meter @xmath8 , namely the @xmath8-th row @xmath9 of @xmath10 , to eventually reach every other node in the network . this way ,",
    "even when only local interactions are allowed , the flow of information can percolate the network .",
    "the importance of the network model will become apparent in section [ sec : dist ] .",
    "the load curve cleansing and imputation problem studied here entails identification and removal of outliers ( or `` bad data '' ) , in addition to completion of the missing entries from the nominal load matrix , and denoising of the observed ones . to some extent ,",
    "it is a joint estimation - interpolation ( prediction)-detection problem . with reference to , given generally incomplete , noisy and outlier - contaminated spatiotemporal load data @xmath36 , the cleansing and imputation tasks amount to estimating the nominal load profiles @xmath19 and the outliers @xmath20 , by leveraging the low - rank property of @xmath19 and the sparsity in @xmath20 .",
    "collaboration between metering devices ( collecting networkwide data ) is considered here , rather than local processing of load curves per bus .",
    "note that load cleansing and imputation are different from _ load forecasting _",
    "@xcite , which amounts to predicting future load demand based on historical data of energy consumption and the weather conditions .",
    "actually , cleansing and imputation are critical preprocessing tasks utilized to enhance the quality of load data , that would be subsequently used for load forecasting and optimum power flow  @xcite .",
    "an estimator matching nicely the specifications of the load curve cleansing and imputation problem stated in section [ ssec : cleanse_impute ] , is the so - termed ( stable ) principal components pursuit ( pcp )  @xcite , that will be outlined here for completeness .",
    "pcp seeks estimates @xmath37 as the minimizers of @xmath38 where the @xmath0-norm @xmath39 and the nuclear norm @xmath40 ( @xmath41 denotes the @xmath42-th singular value of @xmath28 ) are utilized to promote sparsity in the number of outliers ( nonzero entries ) in @xmath20 , and the low rank of @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the nuclear and @xmath0-norms are the closest convex surrogates to the rank and cardinality functions , which albeit the most natural criteria they are in general np - hard to optimize .",
    "the tuning parameters @xmath43 control the tradeoff between fitting error , rank , and sparsity level of the solution . when an estimate @xmath44 of the observation noise variance is available , guidelines for selecting @xmath45 and @xmath46 have been proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the nonzero entries in @xmath47 reveal `` bad data '' across both buses and time .",
    "clearly , it does not make sense to flag outliers in data that has not been observed , namely for @xmath48 . in those cases ( p1 )",
    "yields @xmath49 since both the frobenious and @xmath0-norms are separable across the entries of their matrix arguments .",
    "being convex ( p1 ) is computationally appealing , and it has been shown to attain good performance in theory and practice .",
    "for instance , in the absence of noise and when there is no missing data , identifiability and exact recovery conditions were reported in  @xcite and  @xcite . even when data are missing , it is possible to recover the low - rank component under some technical assumptions  @xcite .",
    "theoretical performance guarantees in the presence of noise are also available  @xcite .    regarding algorithms ,",
    "a pcp solver based on the accelerated proximal gradient method was put forth in  @xcite , while the admm was employed in  @xcite . implementing",
    "these _ centralized _ algorithms presumes that networked metering devices continuously communicate their local load measurements @xmath50 to a central monitoring and data analytics station , which uses their aggregation in @xmath26 to reject outliers and impute missing data .",
    "while for the most part this is the prevailing operational paradigm nowadays , there are limitations associated with this architecture . for instance , collecting all this information centrally may lead to excessive overhead in the communication network , especially when the rate of data acquisition is high at the meters . moreover ,",
    "minimizing ( or avoiding altogether ) the exchanges of raw measurements may be desirable for privacy and cyber - security reasons , as well as to reduce unavoidable communication errors that translate to missing data . performing the optimization in a centralized fashion raises robustness concerns as well , since the central data analytics station represents an isolated point of failure .",
    "these reasons motivate devising fully - distributed iterative algorithms for pcp , embedding the load cleansing and imputation functionality to the ami .",
    "this is the subject of the next section .",
    "a distributed ( d-)pcp algorithm to solve ( p1 ) using a network of smart meters ( modeled as in section [ ssec : comm_model ] ) should be understood as an iterative method , whereby each node carries out simple local ( optimization ) tasks per iteration @xmath51 , and exchanges messages only with its directly connected neighbors .",
    "the ultimate goal is for each node to form local estimates @xmath52 $ ] and @xmath53 $ ] that coincide with the @xmath8-th rows of @xmath54 and @xmath47 as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the solution of ( p1 ) obtained when all data @xmath36 are centrally available .",
    "attaining the centralized performance with distributed data is impossible if the network is disconnected .    to facilitate reducing the computational complexity and memory storage requirements of the d - pcp algorithm sought",
    ", it is henceforth assumed that an upper bound @xmath57 is a priori available [ recall @xmath58 is the estimated low - rank cleansed load profile obtained via ( p1 ) ] .",
    "as argued next , the smaller the value of @xmath59 , the more efficient the algorithm becomes .",
    "small values of @xmath59 are well motivated due to the low intrinsic dimensionality of the spatiotemporal load profiles ( cf .",
