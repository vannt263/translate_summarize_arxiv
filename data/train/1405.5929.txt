    "integral equation approach provides an efficient tool to calculate the correlation and thermodynamic functions of liquids with high accuracy and mild cost of computation ( hansen and mcdonald , 2006 ; ichimaru _ et al .",
    "_ , 1987 ) .",
    "this analytical approach often gives fair results on par with those by extensive monte carlo or molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations , and combined with the reference interaction site model ( rism ) method ( chandler and andersen , 1972 ; hansen and mcdonald , 2006 ; hirata and rossky , 1981 ) , can comprehensively describe the equilibrium properties of molecular liquids such as liquid water ( pettitt and rossky , 1982 ) , which plays essential roles in a variety of biochemical processes .",
    "recent developments in the methods , algorithms and benchmarks ( lombardero _ et al . _ , 1999 ; lue and blankschtein , 1995 ; reddy _ et al .",
    "_ , 2003 ; richardi _ et al .",
    "_ , 1999 ; sato , 2013 ; sumi and sekino , 2006 ) indicate that the rism - based integral equation approach can provide an alternative route for theoretical analyses on water and related aqueous systems with comparable reliability to more expensive , computer simulation approaches .",
    "however , it has also been observed ( lombardero _ et al .",
    "_ , 1999 ; lue and blankschtein , 1995 ; reddy _ et al .",
    "_ , 2003 ; richardi _ et al .",
    "_ , 1999 ; sato , 2013 ; sumi and sekino , 2006 ) that the descriptions of intermolecular correlations of water become less accurate at room temperature in comparison with at higher temperatures .    among the rism - based integral equation formalisms for molecular liquids ,",
    "the density functional theory ( dft ) approach due to chandler , mccoy and singer ( chandler _ et al .",
    "_ , 1986 ) is one of the most sophisticated and dependable methods .",
    "donley , curro and mccoy ( dcm ) ( donley _ et al . _ , 1994 ) then extended this dft scheme for the calculations of pair correlation functions of molecular liquids , and later , reddy _",
    "( reddy _ et al .",
    "_ , 2003 ) and sumi _ et al .",
    "_ ( sumi and sekino , 2006 ) applied this method to the calculations of the radial distribution functions ( rdfs ) of fluid water .",
    "their calculated results demonstrated that the dcm scheme provides accurate descriptions at high temperatures , but the deviations from the computer simulation results are observed at room temperature , _",
    "e.g. _ , in the description of the location of the second peak of oxygen - oxygen ( o - o ) rdf , which may be associated with the formation of tetrahedral structure of condensed water .",
    "considering that the dcm theory is based on the density expansion of free energy functional up to the second order , which corresponds to the hypernetted - chain ( hnc ) approximation ( hansen and mcdonald , 2006 ; ichimaru _ et al .",
    "_ , 1987 ) in liquid theory , the present authors ( tanaka and nakano , 2013 ) have recently extended the dcm theory so as to retain the density expansion of free energy functional up to the third order , thus taking into account the effect of the bridge functions ( hansen and mcdonald , 2006 ; ichimaru _ et al . _ , 1987 ) beyond the hnc approximation . their preliminary test calculation in which a simple gaussian approximation is employed in the factorization ( barrat _ et al .",
    "_ , 1988 ) for the ternary direct correlation functions in the bridge functions has , however , failed to appropriately reproduce the simulation results for liquid water at room temperature , suggesting the importance of incorporation of detailed structures of correlation functions in the representation of ternary direct correlation functions .",
    "the present work then investigates another factorization approximation for the bridge functions , in which the site - site pair correlation functions are employed in the factorization according to a scheme ( iyetomi and ichimaru , 1983 ) that worked well in the one - component plasma system ( ichimaru _ et al .",
    "_ , 1987 ) .",
    "let us consider a liquid water system consisting of rigid @xmath0 molecules whose average number density and temperature are @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "we then assume the site - site interaction potentials @xmath3 between the atomic sites @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 o , h , h , _",
    "i.e. _ , one oxygen and two hydrogens ) on two water molecules . according to the dft scheme ( donley _ et al . _ , 1994 ; tanaka and nakano , 2013 ) , the rdf between the sites @xmath4 and @xmath5 is given by    @xmath7 \\right\\rangle\\right\\rangle_{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$}_{\\alpha},\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$}_{\\beta}}^{\\mathcal{p}}\\ ] ]    with @xmath8 and @xmath9 being the boltzmann constant , where @xmath10 refers to the avarage over the relative orientation of two water molecules whose @xmath4th and @xmath5th sites are fixed at @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , and whose coordinates are represented by @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively . in this expression , the two - body part is given by    @xmath15    with the aid of a site - site pairwise approximation for the induced density ( donley _ et al .",
    "_ , 1994 ) , where    @xmath16    with @xmath17 being the distance between sites @xmath4 and @xmath5 means the intramolecular correlation functions .",
    "the site - site pair correlation functions @xmath18 and the two - body direct correlation functions @xmath19 are then related via the site - site ornstein - zernike or rism equation ( chandler and andersen , 1972 ; hansen and mcdonald , 2006 ) ,    @xmath20,\\ ] ]    where @xmath21 means the convolution . if we neglect the higher - order contribution @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , we are led to a two - body approximation that is equivalent to the hnc approximation ( hansen and mcdonald , 2006 ; ichimaru _ et al . _ , 1987 ) .",
    "the hnc solutions to the integral equations for the correlation functions of fluid water were obtained and compared to the computer simulation and experimental results in the literature ( reddy _ et al .",
    "_ , 2003 ; sumi and sekino , 2006 ; tanaka and nakano , 2013 ) .",
    "in contrast to successful descriptions at higher temperatures , one then observed a significant discrepancy between the hnc and md results at room temperature , in particular concerning the location of the second peak of @xmath23 that was situated at @xmath24    in the hnc result in comparison with @xmath25    in the md and experimental results .",
    "this observation indicates that the o - o tetrahedral ordering in dense , low - temperature water systems is not appropriately described by the second - order , hnc approximation for the intermolecular correlations .",
    "then , we proceed to an incorporation of the triplet correlation term in eq .",
    "( 1 ) . in a preceding dft study ( tanaka and nakano , 2013 ) we derived an explicit expression for @xmath22 in terms of ternary direct correlation functions , and employed , as a first attempt , a simple gaussian approximation for the factorized , three - body direct correlation functions . however , the calculated result for @xmath26 failed to quantitatively reproduce the md or experimental results . in the present study we instead consider another factorization approximation according to iyetomi and ichimaru ( iyetomi and ichimaru , 1983 ) , which took relevant account of the lowest - order contribution and worked well in the case of strongly coupled , one - component plasma ( ichimaru _ et al .",
    ". it is expected that this approximation would provide a good description for hard and soft sphere systems as well as for coulombic system , considering the universality in strongly correlated systems ( hansen and mcdonald , 2006 ; ichimaru _ et al . _ , 1987 ) .",
    "taking into account only the o - o contribution , which would play a primary role , the bridge function can then be given by    @xmath27    with @xmath28 for @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , which is symmetric with respect to @xmath29 and @xmath30 due to the exclusive consideration of o - o correlation .    however , there is a drawback in the expression of eq .",
    "( 5 ) that this form of bridge function does not reproduce the correct short - range bahavior due to @xmath31 at @xmath32 ( barrat _ et al . _ , 1988 ; iyetomi and ichimaru , 1983 ) .",
    "we hence renormalize the bridge function as ( tanaka and nakano , 2013 )    @xmath33    by introducing a short - range enhancement function ( iyetomi and ichimaru , 1983 ) as    @xmath34 + 1.\\ ] ]    the parameters in eq .",
    "( 7 ) are roughly fixed as @xmath35   and @xmath36 in the following analysis , considering the location of the second peak of @xmath23 for the former and the typical magnitude of the short - range renormalization for @xmath37 ( barrat _ et al .",
    "_ , 1988 ; iyetomi and ichimaru , 1983 ) for the latter .",
    "in addition , to reduce the computational cost , we use the experimental results ( soper , 2000 ) for @xmath38 to evaluate @xmath39 in terms of eq .",
    "the behavior of @xmath40 at @xmath41 @xmath42 and @xmath43 k is depicted in fig .  1 .",
    "we have employed the spc / e model ( berendsen _ et al .",
    "_ , 1987 ) for the ( rigid ) structure and intermolecular potentials for water molecules , thus assuming a three - site ( one oxygen and two hydrogens ) model in which the lennard - jones potential works only between the oxygen ( o ) sites .",
    "we have thus carried out the calculation of the rdfs of liquid water at @xmath41 @xmath42 and @xmath43 k , where the renormalized bridge function , @xmath40 , above was employed in eq .",
    "the computational details are found in the literature ( tanaka and nakano , 2013 ) .",
    "the calculated results for @xmath26 are shown in fig .  2 , in which we have also depicted the results by 10 ns md simulation ( tanaka and nakano , 2013 ) for the spc / e water performed with _ amber 12 _ software ( case _ et al .",
    "_ , 2012 ) as well as those by a neutron diffraction experiment ( soper , 2000 ) for comparison .",
    "it is seen in fig .  2 ( b ) and ( c ) that the present dft scheme with inclusion of @xmath40 reproduces the behaviors of @xmath44 and @xmath45 obtained in the md simulation fairly well . concerning the description of @xmath23 seen in fig .  2 ( a )",
    ", on the other hand , the present dft scheme slightly improves the behavior of the second peak of @xmath23 over the hnc result ( reddy _ et al . _ , 2003 ; sumi and sekino , 2006 ; tanaka and nakano , 2013 ) , yielding the ( weak ) peak at @xmath46    in comparison with that at @xmath25    in the md result and @xmath24    in the hnc result .",
    "it should be remarked , however , that the agreement between the dft and md results is still unsatisfactory especially concerning the quantitative description of the oscillatory behavior of @xmath23 , _",
    "e.g. _ , the location of the third peak , thus needing further improvement on the theoretical scheme beyond the factorization approximation in terms of @xmath38 .",
    "for instance , the contributions other than the o - o correlation may play some roles in @xmath22 .",
    "in addition , there is a possibility that the fourth- and higher - order terms contribute to the bridge functions to some extent .    in this context , we have attempted to correct @xmath40 in an _ ad hoc _ way by    @xmath47 - \\exp\\left[-\\left(\\frac{r - r_{2}}{\\delta_{2}}\\right)^{2}\\right ]   - \\exp\\left[-\\left(\\frac{r - r_{3}}{\\delta_{3}}\\right)^{2}\\right]\\right\\}\\ ] ]    with @xmath48 , @xmath49  , @xmath50  , @xmath51  , and @xmath52  , considering the discrepancy between the dft and md results for @xmath23 observed in fig .  2 .",
    "we have thus performed the calculation of rdfs with the corrected bridge function ,    @xmath53    while the correction @xmath54 is very minor as seen in fig .  1 ( a ) ( indiscernible between @xmath40 and @xmath55 at the full scale ) , we have found that this correction substantially improves the agreement between the dft and md results as observed in fig .  2 , which indicates a delicate manner ( see fig .  1 ( b ) at the zoomed scale ) to quantitatively describe the rdfs with the bridge functions at medium to long distances .",
    "more accurate descriptions of the rdfs for liquid water would thus be a challenging task in the framework of many - body theory .",
    "in summary , we calculated the rdfs of liquid water at ambient temperature and density on the basis of the third - order dft method , in which the ternary direct correlation functions were expressed by the factorization with the pair correlation functions and the o - o bridge function was taken into account beyond the hnc approximation in the expression for the rdfs .",
    "improvement on the hnc scheme was thus achieved with the use of the proposed bridge function and its corrected one , especially concerning the behavior of @xmath23 , while some future tasks still remain for better theoretical description .",
