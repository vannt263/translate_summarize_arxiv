    "beyond the original goal of detecting gravitational waves , modern interferometric sensors ( ifo ) ( such as the future advanced ligo ( aligo )  @xcite , the advanced virgo ( avirgo )  @xcite , the lcgt  @xcite , the aei 10 m  @xcite interferometer ; and the proposed third generation detectors such as the einstein telescope ( et )  @xcite ) can be viewed as unique pioneering instruments capable of measuring induced displacements below the @xmath2 scale  @xcite .",
    "this feature opens up myriads of new possibilities for fundamental science . in searches for gravitational waves ( gw )",
    "the signature of the induced displacement of the ifo s test mass ( tm ) ranges from the basically unknown to the well - predicted but yet undetected .",
    "in contrast to this , one may design a precision experiment in which the local gravitational field around the tm of the interferometric sensor is modulated at a given frequency on a well - controlled manner by a dynamic gravity field generator ( dfg ) .",
    "a dfg consists essentially of a rotating mass of null odd and non - null even moments , from which the quadrupole term dominates . in the newtonian limit ,",
    "its effect on the detector is to add a signal at the even - harmonics of the rotation frequency .",
    "a well - characterized dfg has the potential to provide sub - percent calibration for the gw detectors in phase and amplitude as well as to evaluate current theoretical newtonian noise estimates .",
    "this is the subject of a separate publication  @xcite .",

    "miller @xcite used an orbiter sensor , originally developed for measuring the lunar mass distribution , to test newton s @xmath0 law in the @xmath3 scale .",
    "weber and sinsky @xcite used a gw bar detector as a sensor , acoustically stressing a volume of matter at @xmath4 , measuring an excess in noise in the detector consistent to theory .    in the 1980s at the university of tokyo , a series of experiments were carried through to test violations to the inverse square law ( isl ) up to a distance of @xmath5  @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "the coupling between the dynamic gravity field generated by a rotating mass , and the quadrupole moment of a mechanical oscillator antenna was measured as a function of the rotor - antenna separation . with this method",
    "limits on non - newtonian gravity were provided and a measurement of the newtonian constant , g , was found in agreement with previous experiments  @xcite .    in the 1990s ,",
    "the gravitational - wave group at the university of rome developed and carried out experiments @xcite on the cryogenic gw bar detector , explorer , at cern .",
    "a device , rotating at a frequency close to half of the antenna s resonant frequency was developed , and the resulting dynamic field was measured as a function of the source - sensor separation .",
    "the results were then used to derive upper limits to yukawa - like gravitational potential violations at laboratory scale .",
    "the experimental designs cited above consisted in the use of a single dfg in conjunction with bar type gw detectors . in this article we propose a significantly different design , exploiting the exceptional bandwidth and sensitivity of state - of - the - art interferometric sensors .",
    "we illustrate the method through the sensitivity of advanced and third - generation gravitational wave detectors to emphasize the feasible scientific reach . however , it is expected that due to the technical details of gravitational wave detectors , the dfgs based isl measurements shall require dedicated custom configured interferometry .",
    "nevertheless , the sensitivity measure we derive is a solid baseline .",
    "the concept is based on a null - experiment configuration , where a _ pair _ of well matched and symmetrical dfgs , rotating at the same frequency but @xmath6 out of phase , generates a null - signal in the absence of violations to newton s @xmath0 law . in the presence of violations , and within experimental uncertainties , the effect of the two dfgs would not cancel , and a measure of such deviations would be achievable .     +    the most common way of interpreting composition independent tests of non - newtonian gravity ( for review",
    "see e.g.  @xcite and  @xcite ) is through the yukawa formalism , where an additional so - called yukawa term ( @xmath7 ) is added to the classical newtonian gravitational potential ( @xmath8 ) :    @xmath9\\ ] ]    in this expression @xmath10 is the gravitational constant , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the interacting masses , and @xmath13 denotes the distance between the two point masses .",

    "we show that a pair of symmetrical and matched dfgs cancel each other s effect on the tm at twice the rotation frequency in the newtonian limit .",
    "thus we relate the estimated test mass displacement to non - newtonian parametrization of the law of gravitation .",

    "also , an additional effect can be exploited to estimate the dominating error in the two - dfg setup parameters . by applying the parameter uncertainty tolerances given in this section ,",
    "the tm s induced displacement at @xmath152 due to imperfect cancellation of the newtonian term will be orders of magnitudes above the detector noise level and the yukawa term at @xmath152 , and thus will be detectable . by monitoring this signal at @xmath152 we can give a rough estimation on the dominating error in the parameters of the two - dfg setup .",
    "we investigated the projected contributions of the different parameter uncertainties , relative to each other , to the uncertainty of an @xmath101 measurement . to do this",
    ", we carried out a series of monte carlo simulations , where in each simulation , we set the relative uncertainty of a chosen parameter to @xmath18 , and kept the uncertainties of all the other parameters at zero level .",
    "we simulated @xmath121 two - dfg setups , and calculated the relative error of @xmath101 obtained from the @xmath121 hypothetical measurements of @xmath101 . in order to characterize the relative dominance of the different parameters compared to each other",
    ", we normalized the measured relative errors of @xmath101 with the highest such relative error value we obtained .",
    "this way , our final results were basically independent from the @xmath18 relative uncertainty chosen for each individual setup parameters .",
    "the resulting relative dominances of the different parameter uncertainties in the @xmath101 measurement are given in table  [ alpharelativeerrors ] .",
    "our results show that the dominant parameter - for which the allowed uncertainty , @xmath153 , should be kept as low as possible - is the distance between the two dfgs , relative to @xmath154 .",
    ".the relative dominance ( rd ) of parameter uncertainties in terms of their contribution to the uncertainty of @xmath101 in a hypothetical measurement .",
    "we carried out @xmath121 monte carlo trials for each uncertainties , setting the chosen uncertainty to a @xmath18 relative value , and while setting all the other uncertainties to zero .",
    "the relative dominance for each parameter uncertainty was obtained by calculating the relative uncertainty of @xmath101 measured from the @xmath110 trials , and normalizing it by the largest such relative uncertainty value ( thus we get a relative dominance of 1 for the most dominant parameter uncertainty ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ alpharelativeerrors ]    in this subsection we addressed the fundamental sources of measurement errors and the uncertainty limits for each parameter of interest .",
    "we also pointed out , that uncertainty values for dfg parameters used in our proposed experimental setup are within the limits of current state - of - the - art machining and measurement technologies . for a more realistic application a full dynamic finite element simulation of the mass distributions",
    "must be performed .",
    "the expansion and stress factors of the dfgs under prolonged operating conditions must be modeled and simulated , then subsequently measured and taken into account .",
    "practical limitations due to the complex mechanical and detector dynamics / geometry around the test mass and other second order error sources need to be investigated , via experiments and more sophisticated simulations as they might prevent us from reaching the full potential of dfg device based measurements .",
    "for example , in practice material inhomogeneities can give rise to a substantial uncertainty that could be minimized by using ndt - rated materials  @xcite and also reduced by different geometries .",
    "alternative , more simplified dfg geometries different from the one proposed here ( e.g. rotating rods ) could also possibly lead to higher measuring and machining precision , and therefore should be studied carefully .",
    "all these issues will be the scopes of future studies .",
    "significant kinetic energy ( i.e. @xmath155  100 kj ) is stored in the dfg once it rotates , therefore crucial safety considerations must be addressed .",
    "there are two major points of failure management to be concerned with .",
    "( a. ) the vacuum chamber of the dfgs must be made strong enough to withstand the damage of an accidentally disintegrating disk .",
    "this is the standard solution for high speed gyroscopes .",
    "( b. ) for added security , the gap between the inner wall of the vacuum chamber and the outer edge of the rotating disk could be kept relatively _",
    "small_. in the event of an incident where the dfg s material starts to yield or its angular acceleration is uncontrolled the disk will expand radially touching the sidewall and may slowly stop , potentially preempting some of the catastrophic failure modes . adding a heavy ring in contact with the inner lateral wall of the vacuum chamber ( similarly as described in  @xcite )",
    "would absorb a huge angular momentum of the dfg and dissipate its rotation energy via the friction against the lateral wall .",
    "these conditions can be met using finite element analysis ( fea ) aided design , in - house destructive testing of sacrificial parts and relying only on the best base materials .",
    "two dfgs in a null experiment setup in conjunction with an interferometric sensor allow for studies of composition independent non - newtonian contribution to the classical gravitational field in the meter scale .",
    "simulation results presented in this paper indicate that by taking advantage of two matched dfgs and the relatively large bandwidth and high sensitivity of state - of - the - art interferometric sensors there is an exciting opportunity to explore @xmath14 below the current limit in the @xmath156 meter yukawa range addressing standing theoretical predictions .    for the proof of concept study , we chose a conservative 2 meter distance for our device from the test mass of the interferometric detector and used the sensitivity of advanced and third - generation gravitational wave detectors as the realistic baseline .",
    "we intend to note here , that putting the devices considerably closer to the test mass can yield orders of magnitude better limits in isl violation parameters through the characteristic length scale changes for the yukawa case .",
    "there are many practical details that still need close attention when designing and manufacturing a practical device .",
    "finite element analysis of the dfgs and subsequent experimental studies are necessary to completely understand the stresses the dfg is subjected to .",
    "the dfgs need to be enclosed in separate vacuum chambers seated on seismic attenuation stage(s ) .",
    "prototype design and test will be necessary to balance the disk and test vibration control .",
    "direct gravitational coupling into the test mass suspension and seismic isolation system must be carefully designed , simulated and mitigated .",
    "any structure supporting the test mass must be placed far away ( i.e. , tens of meters ) from the double dfg assembly .",
    "other mostly practical problems , such as safety , can also be solved as was shown in past applications / experiments that have used rapidly rotating instruments ( for examples see references in sec .  [ introduction ] ) .",
    "it is also likely that dedicated and custom designed interferometric sensors will be necessary and the direct use of advanced interferometric gravitational wave detectors will not be ideal for technical reasons .    in spite of the promising estimates one should not underestimate the technical difficulties imposed by ( 1 ) the required design precision , ( 2 ) the manufacturing of the dfgs and ( 3 ) the unknown , but experimentally possible to study , complex nature of the coupling routes of the dynamic gravity fields of the dfgs into the complicated mechanical structure of the ifo test masses",
