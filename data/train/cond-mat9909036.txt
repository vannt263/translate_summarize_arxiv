    "in the present work we discuss approximate green s functions ( gf ) of the periodic anderson model ( pam ) that use the atomic limit as a starting point .",
    "we employ these gf to calculate the static magnetic susceptibility and the resistivity of fesi .",
    "fesi has rather unusual magnetic properties,@xcite and in particular a static susceptibility @xmath2 that has a maximum @xmath4 at about @xmath5 k and vanishes for @xmath3 when the low temperature curie tail is subtracted.@xcite several models were studied by jacarino et.al.,@xcite and they found that a simple one , with two very narrow rectangular bands separated by a gap , could be used to fit @xmath2 .",
    "the properties of fesi are very similar to those of the kondo insulators,@xcite and a very simple model that describes most of their properties would consist of two hybridized bands with two electrons,@xcite i.e. : an intrinsic semiconductor with an hybridization gap .  both @xmath2 and the resistivity @xmath6 of fesi have activation laws with characteristic energies of order 0.1 ev , and although band structure calculations@xcite give comparable semiconducting gaps they can not reproduce the large values of @xmath2 . also the measurements of infrared and optical reflectivity can not be described with the predictions of the band calculations,@xcite and the pam seems a more adequate model , both because it becomes the previous model when the coulomb repulsion between the localized electrons is neglected , i.e. : @xmath7 , and because the correlations present in the pam could explain some of the observed features of fesi .    a two - band hubbard model@xcite has been already employed to study fesi , and it is equal to the pam when the dispersion in one band and the coulomb repulsion in the other are zeroed .",
    "another variant of the pam was to add dispersion to the band of localized electrons , and this model has been studied both with @xmath8@xcite and with finite u.@xcite it has been suggested@xcite that it would be interesting to describe the kondo insulators employing the pam with @xmath9 , and this approach is presented here to calculate both @xmath2 and @xmath10 employing approximate@xcite gf . this model has been also used to study the kondo insulator @xmath11 , employing the slave boson technique in the mean field approximation.@xcite varma @xcite argues that the strict kondo lattice ( i.e. with integer f occupation and therefore without charge fluctuations ) is inappropriate for these systems , because it would be rather unlikely to find the chemical potential just in the hybridization gap , and that one would more likely find this situation in a mixed valence system .",
    "our calculation shows that with the simplified model presented here , it is possible to give a fair description of the @xmath2 and @xmath6 of fesi in a typical intermediate valence situation.@xcite    in the study of solid state systems it is sometimes interesting to focus on the local states of the ions placed at the different sites of the crystal @xcite .",
    "the space of the local or ionic states associated to a given site contains many states that are usually of little interest , generally because their occupation can be neglected at fairly low temperatures or frequencies when they are too far apart in energy from the ground state .",
    "it is then useful to eliminate these states from the model of the system , and the hubbard operators@xcite are very convenient for that purpose . in the anderson lattice",
    "we have a broad band of conduction electrons , identified by a subindex @xmath12 and the local @xmath13 states , which will be identified with the subindex @xmath14 for convenience . at each site @xmath15 of the lattice there are four local states : the vacuum state  @xmath16 , the two states @xmath17 of one electron with spin component @xmath18 and the state @xmath19 with two local electrons .  when @xmath8 the state @xmath20 is empty , and one can use the hubbard operators to project it out from the space of local states at site @xmath15 .",
    "one difficulty is that the usual expansions employed with the fermi or bose operators are not valid for these operators , and hubbard introduced for his model of correlated electrons  @xcite a diagrammatic expansion with cumulants  @xcite which uses the electron hopping as a perturbation , and becomes the usual expansion when @xmath7 .",
    "the gfs employed in the present work are based on an extension @xcite of hubbard s cumulant expansion that is valid for the anderson lattice and uses the hybridization as perturbation ; employing this expansion it is possible to express the exact gf in terms of an unknown effective cumulant@xcite @xmath21 . in this work",
    "we shall approximate the effective cumulant by @xmath22 , which is obtained from the exact solution of the anderson lattice in the atomic limit , namely when the band of uncorrelated electrons has zero width@xcite .",
    "the spectral density obtained in this approximation , for typical values of the system parameters , shows a structure close to the chemical potential @xmath23 that corresponds to the kondo resonance and affects the physical properties at low temperatures .",
    "this structure was absent from the gf derived from the cumulant expansion when only cumulants up to fourth order were employed@xcite , and this was the motivation to approximate the effective cumulant by a method that would include all the higher order cumulants that were absent in our previous calculations .",
    "because of its atomic character , the approximate effective cumulant in our method is independent of the wave vector .",
    "our gfs are therefore closely related to those employed by the dynamical mean field theory@xcite of the infinite dimensional problem,@xcite but rather than using a self consistency condition we use physical considerations to chose the parameters that define the effective cumulant .",
    "the dynamical mean field theory has been also employed to study the magnetism of the pam@xcite as well as the transfer of spectral weight in the spectroscopy of correlated electron systems described by this model.@xcite    both the dynamical susceptibility and the conductivity require two - particle gfs in the theory of linear response , but we shall obtain approximate expressions of the static quantities employing the one - particle gfs introduced in this work . with these",
    "gf we obtain the total number of spin up and of spin down electrons in the presence of a weak magnetic field , and the static susceptibility @xmath2 is then proportional to their difference divided into the magnetic field ; we can then compare the ratio @xmath24 with the corresponding experimental value . to simplify the calculation of the effective cumulant we assume equal gyromagnetic factors @xmath25  and @xmath26 , although the extension to different @xmath27  and @xmath28 would not present essential difficulties .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the limit @xmath29 can be used to give an approximate  description of three - dimensional systems , and we shall then use an expression of @xmath30 that is valid in infinite dimension in our calculation for fesi .",
    "this expression is derived from the well known kubo formula , the vertex corrections cancel out when @xmath31@xcite and only the one - particle @xmath32 are then necessary to calculate @xmath33 . in this expression",
    "there are explicit sums over @xmath34 , but when nearest - neighbor hopping in a simple cubic lattice is considered , it is possible to derive expressions@xcite that depend on @xmath35 only through the unperturbed conduction electron energies @xmath36 . as a further simplification that would not change the results in an essential way , we shall use a rectangular band with @xmath37 @xmath38 .    using the expressions of @xmath39 and @xmath2 discussed above we fitted the experimental magnetic susceptibility @xcite @xmath40 and the static resistivity@xcite @xmath41 of fesi  with the same set of parameters in a typical situation of intermediate valence , obtaining a fairly reasonable agreement with the experimental values . to adjust the @xmath2 at high @xmath42 , it was necessary to assume that the thermal expansion affects the value of the system s parameters .    in section [ s02 ]",
    "we discuss the periodic anderson model ( pam ) and the approximate one - particle gf employed in this work . in section [ s03 ]",
    "we analyze the static magnetic susceptibility @xmath2 and the static resistivity @xmath43 of fesi .",
    "conclusions are presented in section [ s04 ] .",
    "as discussed in section [ s01 ] we employ hubbard s operators.@xcite in the general case there is a fixed number @xmath44 of orthogonal states @xmath45 ( identified by indices @xmath46 ) that span a space @xmath47 at each site @xmath15 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the number of sites .",
    "to each site @xmath15 we associate the @xmath50 hubbard operators @xmath51 which transform the state @xmath52 into the state @xmath53 i.e. @xmath54 . the product rules for two operators at the same site are given by @xmath55 and we chose properties equivalent to those of the usual fermi or bose operators when they are at different sites .",
    "we then say that @xmath56 is of the `` fermi type '' ( `` bose type '' ) when the number of electrons in the two states @xmath57 and @xmath58 differ by an odd ( even ) number . for @xmath59",
    "we then use @xmath60 when the two operators are of the `` fermi type '' and @xmath61 = 0 $ ] when at least one is of the `` bose type '' ( as usual@xcite @xmath62=ab - ba$ ] and @xmath63 ) .",
    "the anderson lattice with finite @xmath64 is described by the hamiltonian @xmath65 where @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) is the usual creation ( annihilation ) operator of conduction band electrons with wavevector @xmath68 and spin component @xmath69 , where @xmath70 .",
    "the @xmath71 @xmath72and @xmath73 correspond to the local f or d electrons at site @xmath15 , and @xmath74 when @xmath7 eq.([e2.3 ] ) describes two hybridized bands of uncorrelated electrons .",
    "the state space of the f - electrons at each site @xmath15 is spanned by the four states@xmath75 @xmath76 and @xmath77 , with @xmath70 .",
    "the state @xmath77 is empty when @xmath78 , and we shall consider a reduced space of states by projecting @xmath77 out , so that @xmath47 is a three dimensional space . to make the connection with the hubbard operators one could substitute the identity@xcite @xmath79 into eq .",
    "( [ e2.3 ] ) , where the factor @xmath18 is necessary to obtain the correct phase of the states . eliminating the @xmath80 and @xmath81 one obtains the projection of @xmath82 into the reduced space , namely @xmath83",
    "the cumulant expansion has been employed by several authors to study ising s and heisenberg s models,@xcite while hubbard@xcite extended the method to a quantum problem with fermions . in this technique",
    "the cumulant averages@xcite are used to rearrange the usual perturbative expansion,@xcite and it is possible to derive a diagrammatic expansion involving unrestricted lattice sums of connected diagrams , that satisfies a linked cluster theorem .",
    "this technique was extended to the anderson lattice,@xcite and a brief description is given here .",
    "the method employs the grand canonical ensemble of electrons , and it is then convenient to introduce @xmath84    where @xmath23 is the chemical potential and @xmath85 is the number of electrons in the state @xmath86 . the last term in eq . ( [ e2.5 ] ) will be considered as the perturbation , and the exact and unperturbed averages of any operator @xmath87 are respectively denoted by @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "it is also convenient to introduce @xmath90 because these are the forms that consistently appear in the calculations .",
    "the matsubara expansion@xcite is employed , so that @xmath91 is an imaginary time in the gfs @xmath92 , where @xmath93 identifies the transition @xmath94 , and @xmath95 the subindex @xmath96 in the definition of the gf indicates that the operators inside the parenthesis are taken in the order of increasing @xmath91 to the left , with a change of sign when two fermi - type operators have to be exchanged to obtain this ordering .",
    "the inverse of plank s @xmath97 and of boltzmann s @xmath98 are usually included into the real and imaginary temperatures @xmath42 and @xmath91 , as well as in several other parameters , so that all of them are given in terms of a common energy unit .    some of the infinite diagrams which contribute to the gf @xmath99 are shown in figure  [ f4_1 ] , and the full circles ( f - vertices ) correspond to the cumulants of the f - electrons .",
    "each line reaching a vertex is associated to one of the @xmath100 operators of the cumulant , and the free lines ( i.e. those that do not join an empty circle ) correspond to the external @xmath100 operators appearing in the exact gf . an explicit definition of the cumulants can be found in the references , and they can be calculated by employing a generalized wick s theorem.@xcite    the first diagram in figure  [ f4_1]a corresponds to the simplest free propagator @xmath101 , and the second diagram in that figure has an empty circle ( c - vertex ) that corresponds to the conduction electron cumulant , equal to the free propagator@xmath102 @xmath103 .",
    "the interaction is represented by the lines ( edges ) joining two vertices and , because of the structure of the hybridization , they always join a c - vertex to an f - vertex ; the number of edges in a diagram gives its order in the perturbation expansion .",
    "cumulants containing statistically independent operators are zero , and those appearing in the present formalism ( with the hybridization as perturbation ) vanish unless they contain only @xmath100 operators at the same site or only @xmath104 or @xmath105 operators with the same @xmath106 and @xmath18 .",

    "these energies are given by the two roots of @xmath143 , where @xmath144    the spectral density for the unperturbed f - electrons is a @xmath145-function at @xmath146 , and @xmath131 becomes two bands with a gap centered at @xmath146 and roughly proportional to the reduced hybridization constant @xmath147 in the cha .",
    "when the system is in the `` kondo region '' in which the local state has nearly the maximum occupation compatible with the paramagnetic state , viz .",
    "@xmath148 in the average , a narrow temperature - dependent peak , the `` kondo peak '' , should appear very close to the chemical potential , i.e. near to @xmath149 in the variables we use .",
    "this peak is responsible for many properties of the `` heavy fermions'',@xcite and it is closely related to the increase in resistivity when t decreases , observed in many metals with magnetic impurities at low t. in combination with the effect of phonons , that make the resistivity increase with t , it is responsible for the minimum in resistivity , named the kondo effect , that is observed in those systems . to explain this behavior it was essential to consider a third order perturbation that includes spin - flip processes.@xcite these processes are absent from the cha , because diagrams with only second order cumulants do not include them , so that the absence of the kondo peak in that approximation is not surprising .",
    "the gfs proposed in this work avoid the laborious explicit calculation of higher order cumulants by including all of them in an approximate way .      in the calculation with the usual fermi or bose operators , the one - particle propagator of the f - electron is given by a sum of diagrams of the same type @xcite shown in figure [ f4_1]a but with each vertex corresponding to the sum of all `` proper '' ( or irreducible ) diagrams.@xcite the same result is found in the cumulant expansion of the hubbard model for @xmath150,@xcite when the electron hopping is employed as perturbation .",
    "the vertices then represent an `` effective cumulant '' @xmath151 , that is independent of @xmath139 because only diagrams of a special type contribute to this quantity for @xmath150 .    in the cumulant expansion of the anderson lattice@xcite we employ the hybridization rather than the hopping as a perturbation , and the exact solution of the conduction electrons problem in the absence of hybridization is part of the zeroth order hamiltonian . for this reason it became necessary to extend metzner s derivation@xcite to the anderson lattice , and we have shown@xcite that the same type of results obtained by metzner are also valid for this model .",
    "these results had been used@xcite to obtain the exact gf employed in the present work , but since then we realized that the expression of the exact gf is valid for all dimensions and it is not necessary to assume infinite dimension in that part of the derivation . as with the feynmann diagrams , one can rearrange all those that contribute to the exact @xmath124 by defining an effective cumulant @xmath152 , that is given by all the diagrams of @xmath153 that can not be separated by cutting a single edge ( usually called `` proper '' or `` irreducible '' diagrams ) .",
    "the exact gf @xmath153 is then given by the family of diagrams in figure [ f4_1]a , but with the effective cumulant @xmath154 in place of the bare cumulant @xmath155 at all the filled vertices.the exact gf for the f electron is then written as @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the frequency fourier transform of @xmath158 , and in a similar way one obtains the exact gf for the c - electron , namely @xmath159    it is clear that for arbitrary dimension we have not gained much with eq.([e2.8 ] ) , because the calculation of @xmath160 is as difficult as that of @xmath124 .",
    "we circumvent this obstacle by resorting to replace @xmath161 by the corresponding quantity @xmath22 of an exactly soluble model , which is the atomic limit of the anderson lattice .",
    "the hopping is neglected in this system , described by the hamiltonian of eqs .",
    "( [ e2.3 ] ) or ( [ e2.5 ] ) with @xmath162 , and it already contains the basic physics of the formation of the singlet ground state and of the appearance of the kondo peak in the pam , as it is discussed in review articles.@xcite because of its atomic character , the approximate effective cumulant @xmath22 thus obtained is independent of @xmath34 ,  and can be calculated exactly as shown in the next section .",
    "being a special case of the pam , it implicitly contains all the higher order cumulants .",
    "the effective cumulant is also independent of @xmath34 when @xmath163 , and the very successful `` dynamical mean field theory''@xcite also employs gfs corresponding to those in eqs .  ( [ e2.8],[e2.8b ] ) .",
    "the exact solution of the local problem has been already used in different ways to study the anderson lattice .",
    "the limit @xmath8 was studied in the intermediate valence case@xcite by considering only the lowest four eigenstates of the local hamiltonian and the magnetic instabilities and susceptibility were discussed employing the resulting self - consistent hamiltonian.@xcite considering only the atomic limit , viz .",
    "taking @xmath164 , alascio et.al.@xcite studied the model for the whole range of parameters , showing that `` most of the essential characteristics '' of these systems `` are present in this crudely simplified hamiltonian '' .",
    "simes et.al .",
    "@xcite employed the atomic limit together with a diagrammatic method,@xcite that is essentially equivalent to our cha , considering both the hopping and the hybridization as perturbations .",
    "an important improvement of the technique was to apply the same diagrammatic expansion to the exact solution of the atomic limit,@xcite employing only the hopping as perturbation , and this technique has also been applied to study the problem with finite @xmath64.@xcite    as discussed in the previous section we introduce the exact expression for the gf that is given in terms of an effective cumulant @xmath165 , however replacing this quantity by the approximate @xmath166 . as this treatment",

    "it is important to notice that for a system with given values of @xmath197 , @xmath198 and @xmath199 , the position of the levels in figure [ f7_2 ] changes with the chemical potential @xmath23 . in that figure",
    "we have @xmath200 and @xmath201 , and in that system the ground state is always the singlet @xmath202 , which has no magnetic moment in the absence of field but can have a rather large induced moment because of the proximity of the magnetic triplet.@xcite      the atomic effective cumulant approximation ( aeca ) consists in substituting @xmath203 in eq .",

    "it should be emphasized that this diagrams contain loops of any size , because there is no excluded site in this expansion , and all the filled circles correspond to the same site , although they appear as different vertices in the diagram .",
    "the difference between the exact and approximate quantities is that different energies @xmath205 appear in the c - electron propagators of the effective cumulant @xmath151 , while these energies are all equal to @xmath197 in @xmath22 .",
    "although @xmath22 is for that reason only an approximation , it contains all the diagrams that should be present , and one would expect that the corresponding gf would have fairly realistic features .",

    "another important point , is that concentrating all the conduction electrons at @xmath197 would overestimate their contribution to the effective cumulant , and we shall then reduce the hybridization by a coefficient that gives the fraction of c - electrons which contribute most .",
    "we consider that this is of the order of @xmath209 , where @xmath210 is the density of states of the free c electrons per site and per spin , and to be more definite we chose @xmath211 , so the effective hybridization constant @xmath212 coincides with the usual `` mixing strength '' @xmath213 .",
    "this is essentially the same choice made by alascio et.al.@xcite in their localized description of valence fluctuations .",
    "note that @xmath212 is only used in the calculation of @xmath214 , and that the full value must be substituted in the @xmath215 that appears explicitly in eq .",

    "it was then necessary to resort to the more laborious calculation at constant @xmath232 .",
    "the parameters employed in the numerical calculations are numbers that have to be scaled later to describe the different particular physical situations , and for brevity we shall call them `` unscaled parameters '' .",
