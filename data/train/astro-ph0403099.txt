    "the larger scatter in velocity measurements among the target - reference star combinations is likely due to external systematic effects such as small shifts in the position of the ccd throughout the night caused by thermal relaxation of the detector mount .",

    "the first class of models posits the existence of a single star surrounded by a circumstellar disk containing a nonaxisymmetric density enhancement or alternatively , a warp .",

    "perhaps more importantly , it is not clear if a binary companion to is compatible with an eclipsing disk feature .",
    "if a density enhancement in a circumstellar disk is responsible for the 48day photometric period , the feature must orbit the central star at a distance of @xmath106  au , assuming a keplerian orbit",
    ". this geometry would restrict the stellar companion to orbit either at a distance less than 0.22 au or beyond the outer extent of the circumstellar disk .",

    "neither of these scenarios seems plausible .",
    "thus , it does not seem possible for both an eclipsing disk feature and a stellar - mass companion to coexist with the same orbital period .",
    "in the second class of models , proposed by w04 and cm04 , there exists an unseen binary companion of comparable mass to the visible k - type star seen today .",
    "surrounding the two stars is a circumbinary disk viewed nearly edge - on .",

    "perhaps the greatest advantage of the two - star models is their ability to explain not only the present - day light curve , but also its evolution over the past half century .",
    "in addition to explaining the photometric phenomenology of kh  15d , the two - star models make predictions about the nature of the binary orbit .",

    "we note here that our center of mass velocity for the binary system of @xmath113  clearly rules out w04 model 2 , which predicts @xmath114  kms and negative velocity at periapse .",

    "we note that the w04 model has the peculiar feature that the less massive star is the more luminous star . using equation [ ma ]",

    "yield a mass of a between 0.5 and 1.0 .",
    "therefore , for a mass ratio of 1.6 , the eccentricity reported by w04 ( @xmath109 ) is larger than the value allowed by our radial velocity measurements assuming @xmath82  .",
    "however , this discrepancy is not too surprising since the w04 model used only two radial velocity measurements .",
    "it is also important to note that the mass limits of star a are derived by placing on a theoretical hr diagram and are therefore subject to the accuracy of the pms evolutionary model employed . in all other features of the binary system",
    ", there is a remarkable agreement between the w04 model and the orbital solution calculated from the radial velocities .",
    "because of the strong evidence of a second star from our radial velocity measurements and the historical photometry , we find the two - star class of model to be the most compelling explanation of the photometric variability mechanism .",
