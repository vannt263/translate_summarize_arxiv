    "over the last few decades ( starting with fall & efstathiou 1980 and fall 1983 ) there has been a substantial effort towards understanding , theoretically and through observations , how galaxies have reached their current sizes over cosmic time . the answer to this question plays a key role in our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "several approaches have been tried to make specific predictions about how sizes of galaxies ( particularly the disk galaxies ) evolves with redshift : semi  analytical hierarchical models , direct numerical simulations and infall models .",
    "analytical hierarchical model assumes simple scaling relationships between the properties of the galaxy disks and the halos in which they reside ( lacey et al .",
    "1993 ; kauffmann & charlot 1994 ; dalcanton et al .",
    "1997 ; mo , mao & white 1998 ; sommerville & primack 1999 ; van den bosch 2000 ; cole et al .",
    "2000 ; naab & ostriker 2006 ) . according to this picture ,",
    "galaxy disks are formed from gas with some initial angular momentum that cools and contracts in dark matter halos .",
    "the mass and the angular momentum that settle in the disk are some fixed fractions of the mass and the angular momentum of the halo respectively .",
    "the mass and size of the halos are tightly linked to the density of the universe at the time the halos were formed ; consequently , halos formed at high  z are expected to be much denser than halos formed at lower z. under the assumption that the fractions of disk mass and angular momentum in the disk relative to the halo , together with the spin parameter of the halo do not vary with redshift , mo et al .",
    "suggest the following redshift scaling for the size of the baryonic disk at their @xmath17 redshift : r @xmath18 h@xmath19(z ) at a fixed circular halo velocity or r @xmath18 h@xmath20(z ) at a fixed halo mass , where h(z ) is the hubble constant at a given z : h(z)=h@xmath21[@xmath22(1+z)@xmath23+@xmath24@xmath25 in a flat universe .",
    "high  resolution n  body / gas - dynamical simulations ( navarro & steinmetz 2000 ; brook et al .",
    "2006 ) find that the above picture is too simplistic ; e.g. large systematic variations in the fraction of baryons that collapse to form galaxies are observed and angular momentum conservation may not hold .",
    "moreover , the explanation of the observed local size  mass relation within this hierarchical context ( shen et al . 2003 ) requires that the above scaling between the dark matter and baryons is broken and instead that the fraction of baryons in the disk is a function of the halo mass .",
    "this is also predicted by standard feedback models based on galactic winds .",
    "the infall model approach ( cayn , silk & charlot 1996 ; bouwens , cayn & silk 1997 ) examines a number of local disk galaxies in great detail and uses detailed models of their observed properties , e.g. gas profiles , stellar profiles , metallicity profiles , current star formation rate ( sfr ) , and age  metallicity relationships , to infer how galaxies might have evolved from high redshift .",
    "this approach uses the local universe as a reference and consequently does not explain why the local galaxy population is as it is .",
    "the main ingredients of these models are : a ) that the sfr is determined at each radius and time from the local gas density according to a schmidt  type law , and b ) that metal  free gas infalls with certain time - scale .",
    "using the milky way as reference , bouwens & silk ( 2002 ) provide the following size scaling relationship with redshift : r(z)/r(0)=1 - 0.27z .    in the case of spheroid",
    " dominated galaxies , they are expected to form from the merging of smaller systems ( white & frenk 1991 ) and consequently to have a different size evolution than disk  dominated systems .",
    "the old stellar populations found in nearby ellipticals make it unlikely that these galaxies were the remnant of a merger between two similar spirals drawn from the observed local population .",
    "in fact , khochfar & burkert ( 2003 ) have shown that dissipationless mergers of early  type galaxies may dominate the formation of the nowadays high ",
    "mass early  type galaxies .",
    "in addition , there is some observational ( van dokkum 2005 ; tran et al .",
    "2005 ; bell et al .",
    "2006 ) and theoretical ( naab , khochfar & burkert 2006 ; boylan  kolchin et al .",
    "2006 ) evidence pointing towards the merger of red galaxies as the potential formation mechanisms for the spheroid population .",
    "shen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have shown that the present  day stellar mass  size relation for early  type galaxies follows r@xmath18m@xmath26 .",
    "shen et al .",
    "indicate that the present  day relation is consistent with a model where early  type galaxies are the remnants of repeated mergers where the progenitors have properties similar to those of faint ellipticals . according to their model , the size of the remnant increases after each merger .",
    "in this context , we would expect that early  type galaxies that have undergone a major merger were larger in size than galaxies of the same mass that have not suffered such a process .",
    "detailed modeling of the merger histories of galaxies in the cold dark matter scenario suggests that the last major merging event is typically around redshift unity ( kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ) .",
    "consequently , we would expect that the sizes of early  type galaxies at z@xmath101 were , in general , smaller than the local counterparts .",
    "an analysis of the evolution of the stellar mass  size relation at high  z of these objects can constrain the above scenario of merging formation .",
    "historically , the monolithic collapse scenario ( eggen , lynden  bell & sandage 1962 ; larson 1975 ) envisioned that all spheroidal galaxies formed very early via a rapid collapse of the gas at high redshift . in this picture",
    ", e / s0s would already be in place at high  z and we would expect then that the changes in the observed properties of early  type galaxies over time were due to simple passive fading of their stellar populations . the more modern version of this scenario ( e.g. chiosi & carraro 2002 ; merlin & chiosi 2006 ) envisions that massive ellipticals also formed hierarchically , but at quite high redshift .",
    "the evolution of individual galaxies is not directly observable .",
    "however , look  back studies can provide extensive information on how the population properties of galaxies have changed with cosmic epoch .",
    "early studies ( smail et al . 1995 ; casertano et al .",
    "1995 ; roche et al .",
    "1998 ) showed that galaxies at a given luminosity were smaller in the past .",
    "however , it was not until the application of the lyman - break technique ( steidel et al .",
    "1996 ) that the study of a large number of galaxies at high  z was possible .",
    "this technique is especially efficient at selecting star  forming galaxies at z@xmath102 .",
    "sizes have been measured for these lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) ( giavalisco , steidel & macchetto 1996 ; lowenthal et al .",
    "1997 ; ferguson et al .",
    "2004 ) , but using optical filters , i.e. measuring their sizes in the rest ",
    "frame ultra - violet ( uv ) region of their spectra . at these wavelengths the lbgs appear compact ( r@xmath80.20.3 , @xmath81.52.5 h@xmath4@xmath19 kpc ) . however , there is some evidence that the lbg morphology depends very little on the wavelength , remaining essentially unchanged from the far  uv to the optical window ( giavalisco 2002 ; papovich et al .",
    "2005 ) .    as a result of the dearth of very deep near  infrared ( nir ) images , most of the studies using the rest ",

    "2005 ) . to properly compare with local optically selected samples and to trace the size evolution in a consistent fashion at z@xmath101 one",
    "needs to use very deep nir data .",
    "consequentially any observed size evolution would then reflect true evolutionary changes not subject to the changing appearance of galaxies in different bandpasses .",
    "moreover , it seems now clear that rest - frame uv selected samples do not provide a complete census of the galaxy population at high  z ( e.g. franx et al .",
    "2003 ; van dokkum et al . 2003 ; daddi et al .",
    "2004 ) and , in particular , a substantial population of red objects are missing from purely rest - frame uv selected surveys .",
    "in addition to the use of rest  frame optical sizes , it would be of great help to facilitate a direct comparison with the theoretical expectations if the size evolution could be measured at a given mass rather than a given luminosity . using circular velocity measurements to estimate galaxy masses at high ",
    "z is difficult and few objects have been analyzed ( see e.g. vogt et al .",
    "1996 ; 1997 ; boehm & ziegler 2006 ; erb et al .",
    "an alternative approach is to estimate the stellar masses from their rest ",
    "frame colors and spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .    with the above ideas in mind we performed an exploratory work ( trujillo et al .",
    "2004 ) to probe the evolution of the luminosity  size and stellar mass  size relations of the galaxies out to z@xmath83 .",
    "that work used very deep nir images of the hubble deep field ",

    "we found that the rest ",
    "band sizes of luminous galaxies ( @xmath11l@xmath0@xmath10@xmath84@xmath210@xmath3 h@xmath4@xmath5l@xmath6 ) at 2@xmath11z@xmath113 were 3 times smaller than for equally luminous galaxies today .",
    "in contrast , the stellar mass  size relation had evolved relatively little : the size of galaxies more massive than 2@xmath210@xmath3h@xmath4@xmath5m@xmath6 , were @xmath81.5 times smaller at z@xmath82.5@xmath110.2@xmath27 ) were overstimated .",
    "this produced a slight underestimation on the degree of evolution in the luminosity and stellar mass size relation .",
    "this problem has been solved in the present version . ] .    in the present work we add to the above data set the results from the analysis of the @xmath8 4 times larger ms105403 fires field .",
    "using both fires fields we decrease the effects of the field  to  field variations in our results and multiply by three the number of objects with z@xmath101 in our sample .",
    "in addition , we make a detailed comparison of our results with those found in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",

    "2006 ; in preparation ) has been quantified : a larger amount of dust increases the attenuation and the observed size ( in terms of scalelength ) of the objects .",
    "the observed size is larger because the dust is more strongly concentrated towards the central region of the galaxies and consequently the flux gradient is flattened .",
    "the size evolution presented in this paper is measured in relation to the observed ( uncorrected for dust ) size of the local galaxies , consequently if the dust opacity were not to change with redshift the observed evolution presented in this paper would remain unchanged .",

    "consequently , we have not made any attempt to correct our results for the effect of opacity .",
    "nevertheless , in order to provide a crude estimation of how a significant increase in opacity could affect our results we have made the following exercise : let s assume a mean inclination of 30@xmath109 and a increase in the total central face  on optical depth in b  band from 4 ( present  day galaxies ) to 8 ( high  z galaxies ) .",
    "this change implies a transition from an intermediate to a moderately optically thick case . in this case , for a disk  like galaxy observed in the v  band restframe , the attenuation increases by @xmath80.2 mag ( tuffs et al .",
    "2004 ; their fig . 3 and table 4 ) and",
    "the scalength increases by @xmath815% ( mllenhoff et al . 2006 ; in preparation ) .",

    "( 2004 ) these two results can be reconciled when we take into account the strong mass  to  light ratio evolution that galaxies have experienced in the past .",
    "such m / l evolution must also play a big role in explaining the strong l@xmath110r@xmath111 evolution seen in high  z samples ( e.g. ferguson et al .",
    "2003 ) .    beyond the empirical result , it is of interest to compare the observed evolution with the theoretical predictions . in fig .",
    "[ gemsfires ] we show the expectations from semianalytical hierarchical and infall models for disk  like galaxies compared to the observed size evolution .",
    "we first concentrate our attention on the evolution of the sizes at a given luminosity .",

    "yet , it must be borne in mind that this match implies a mean stellar m / l that is constant with redshift , known to be incompatible with the color evolution of the same galaxies .",
    "the agreement between h@xmath20(z ) and the data must therefore be considered fortuitous , rather than a direct confirmation of the mo et al . model .    the infall ( bouwens & silk 2002 ) model predicts directly the evolution of the size at a given luminosity for milky way type objects .",
    "for that reason , we compare the infall model only with the observed size evolution at a given luminosity for galaxies with exponential ",
    "type profiles ( upper left panel in fig .",
    "[ gemsfires ] ) .",
    "we see that the agreement of this model with the observed evolution is excellent for galaxies at all z. the infall model , however , must fail at higher z. in fact , this model shows an improbably fast decrease for galaxies with z@xmath102.5 and , for z@xmath13.7 , this model produces sizes with values less than zero .",
    "if we focus now on the size evolution at a given disk mass and assume that the stellar mass is a good indicator of the total baryonic mass settled in the disk ( which the gas fraction at high redshift might invalidate ) , we can make a comparison between the mo et al . model prediction and the observed size evolution at a given disk mass .",
    "the bottom left panel of fig.[gemsfires ] shows that this hierarchical model ( under the assumption stated in the introduction ) produces a stronger evolution in the sizes than is observed .",
    "however , at all z the model can not be rejected at 3@xmath14 confidence level .",
    "consequently , although the observed evolution is weaker than the predicted size evolution r@xmath18 h@xmath20(z ) at a fixed halo mass , this model can not be rejected with the present dataset .",
    "the mo et al .",
    "( 1998 ) model describes the evolution of the baryonic disk size at a given halo mass whereas the data show the stellar disk size evolution at a given stellar mass .",
    "we now explore whether this difference maybe responsible for the data model discrepancy apparent in the bottom left panel of fig.[gemsfires ] .",
    "we consider two aspects : a ) the ratio of the stellar mass to the halo mass , m@xmath112/m@xmath113 , can evolve with redshift and b ) the ratio of the stellar disk to the baryonic disk size , r@xmath112/r@xmath114 , can also change .",
    "these factors can be visualized by writing out the following identity : @xmath115 where @xmath116 are the observables and @xmath117 are the quantities more inmediately predicted by mo et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .    one possible choice to describe the accumulation of stellar mass within halos is by the globally measured build  up of stellar mass : m@xmath112/m@xmath113(z)@xmath8@xmath11@xmath118(z)@xmath10 , where we take @xmath11@xmath118(z)@xmath10 from rudnick et al .",
    "taking r@xmath112/r@xmath114@xmath431 for now , this picture would predict a nearly redshift  independent r@xmath112m@xmath112 relation ( dotted line in bottom left panel of fig .",
    "[ gemsfires ] ) .",
    "however , this picture would imply that stellar disks form from early  on in large halos and that the stellar disk , already in its infancy ( m@xmath112/m@xmath113@xmath119m@xmath112/m@xmath113(z=0 ) ) samples the full angular momentum distribution of its large halo .    from a variety of observational and theoretical arguments",
    "r@xmath112/r@xmath114 can not be unity at all epochs . as the solid line in fig .",
    "[ gemsfires ] illustrates , through altering this assumption by 1530% ( i.e. by assuming @xmath120@xmath18 h@xmath121(z ) ) it would be easy to match the observations .",
    "the degree of evolution in the observed stellar mass  size relation with redshift implies that galaxies must evolve with time , increasing their size as they build up their stellar mass .",
    "consequently , galaxies on average appear to grow inside  out .",
    "newly formed stars must preferentially reside at larger and larger radii ( trujillo & pohlen 2005 ) .    in interpreting the evolution of spheroid  like objects",
    "a different reference hypothesis suggests itself : we analyze whether the decrease in typical galaxy effective radius with lookback time at a given luminosity is consistent with a passively fading galaxy population .    to test the above idea we plot on fig .",
    "[ gemsfires ] different tracks showing the expected size evolution of a fading galaxy population with different formation redshifts .",
    "these tracks are evaluated under the assumption that the shape of the local luminosity  size relation does not change with redshift but for a shift of the relation to brighter luminosities at increasing z. the increase in the luminosity with z is estimated by using the expected luminosity evolution from a single burst at high  z ( in our case , we have used z@xmath122=3 , 5 and 7 ) using the pgase code ( fioc & rocca  volmerange 1997 ) . following the same procedure as with actual data , after shifting the luminosity  size relation we measure the ratio between the effective radii at a given luminosity for luminosities brighter than 3.4@xmath210@xmath3h@xmath4@xmath5l@xmath6 . from the comparison , we see that the evolution of the luminosity - size relation for high  n galaxies is consistent with a fading population of galaxies formed since z@xmath83 to 7 .    however , although the above agreement is encouraging , the full population of spheroid galaxies we see today is unlikely to be evolving passively since z@xmath83 .",
    "the passive scenario is against the observed evolution of the co  moving total stellar mass density in passive red  sequence galaxies .",
    "this density is lower at earlier epochs , amounting to a factor of @xmath82 buildup since z@xmath81 ( chen et al .",
    "2003 ; bell et al .",
    "2004 ; cross et al . 2004 ) or a factor of @xmath810 since z@xmath83 ( labb et al . 2005 ) .",
