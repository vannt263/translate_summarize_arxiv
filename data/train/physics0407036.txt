    "electron transfer ( et ) processes are one of the fundamental phenomena in complex molecular systems @xcite , the most prominent one being the primary step of photosynthesis @xcite . in the last decade or",
    "so much theoretical and experimental efforts have been focused on bridged molecular systems where the transfer from a donor to an acceptor is mediated by a molecular structure connecting them @xcite .",
    "particular attention has been paid to dna complexes with to some extent still controversial results @xcite . of foremost importance are donor - bridge - acceptor ( dba ) systems in the strongly rising field of molecular electronics @xcite . based on advanced methods of synthetic chemistry , nowadays",
    ", bridge units with specific chemical and physical properties can be produced and linked to donor / acceptor species or contacted with metal leads and thus integrated into electrical circuits .    since the pioneering work of marcus and jortner @xcite the influence of residual vibronic modes and a solvent environment on the et is known to be extremely crucial .",
    "in fact , the presence of a dissipative surrounding is the prerequisite for a directed ( irreversible ) transport across dba complexes meaning that bath parameters such as temperature and spectral densities have a sensitive impact @xcite .",
    "accordingly , basically two distinct transport channels have been identified . for high lying and short bridges quantum mechanical tunneling",
    "gives rise to a superexchange mechanism associated with a characteristic exponentially decreasing yield with increasing bridge length .",
    "if the bridge is sufficiently long , however , sequential transfer processes ( hopping ) dominate based on thermal activation .",
    "theoretically the competition between these channels has been investigated based on redfield theory and simple system+reservoir models in ref .",
    "@xcite and more recently in refs .",
    "@xcite . in these studies the mentioned exponential length dependence",
    "as well as an algebraic decrease of the transfer rate in case of a sequential mechanism has been found empirically .",
    "this latter behavior has been also derived explicitly from a more rigorous formulation in ref .",
    "@xcite . in most of these previous studies",
    "symmetric dba systems were considered with degenerate donor / acceptor and degenerate bridge states since they already display the essential features and make the analysis particularly transparent .",
    "additional simplifying assumptions about the nature of the thermal bath coupled to the et have been invoked to obtain explicit results since , as for most dissipative quantum systems @xcite , a numerical description is extremely demanding .",
    "indeed , it has been one of the major challenges in recent years in physics and chemistry to develop efficient algorithms to get access to a detailed analysis of these systems .",
    "as shown first by feynman and vernon @xcite and in the 1980s by caldeira and leggett @xcite , the path integral representation is particularly suited as a starting point .",
    "namely , for gaussian bath fluctuations the environmental degrees of freedom can be eliminated exactly leading to the reduced system dynamics .",
    "in contrast to perturbative approaches as e.g.  redfield theory this formulation has the merit of being applicable down to zero temperature , to adiabatic bath modes , and strong friction .",
    "a direct numerical evaluation of the corresponding path integral expression for the density matrix is not possible though .",
    "the reason for that are the interactions , non - local in time , among forward and backward paths generated by the bath degrees of freedom .",
    "typically , the range of these interactions grows with @xmath0 .",
    "an efficient numerical approach that relies on a finite interaction range for sufficiently high temperatures has been developed by makri and co - workers @xcite and applied to a variety of systems meanwhile .",
    "presently , the only numerically exact approach is given by path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) simulations @xcite .",
    "it has been successfully applied to the spin - boson system to study e.g.  the influence of nonequilibrium initial bath distributions @xcite , the role of vibronic and electronic coherences @xcite , and electronic transfer rates in large ranges of parameter space @xcite . for a dba system with one intermediate electronic site ( three - state system ) which can be seen as simple model for the primary charge separation of photosynthesis pimc results could describe most of the experimental key features @xcite .",
    "one fundamental problem of the pimc , though , is intimately connected with the constitutive role of interferences in quantum mechanical systems .",
    "known as the _ dynamical sign problem _ @xcite , it turns out that the number of sample paths needed to achieve a sufficient signal - to - noise ratio increases exponentially with the simulated system time . to partially circumvent this drawback various techniques have been introduced and shown to stabilize the simulations considerably @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is twofold : on the one hand the challenge is to present a pimc approach applicable to larger discrete systems and longer simulation times in order to lay the basis to treat bridge systems with more electronic sites , a complicated topology including impurities , and/or in presence of external periodic driving .",
    "on the other hand , motivated by the above mentioned works on symmetric bridges , our intention is to investigate the role of the superexchange and the sequential mechanisms in et within a complete system+reservoir model and with a numerically exact approach .",
    "this way , we avoid simplifying assumptions about the bath , the system - bath coupling , or the structure of the bath along the molecular bridge .",
    "accordingly , our results can directly be compared with analytical rate expressions derived within marcus theory @xcite , golden rule approaches @xcite , or cluster expansion methods @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , such an analysis of numerical results within the context of the available theoretical findings is still missing .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we start in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] by defining the system and the bath and introducing its path integral representation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : population dynamics ] the connection to the description in terms of master equations is revealed and known results for the electronic transfer rates are discussed .",
    "then , in sec .  [ sec : simulation method ] the pimc used and developed in this paper is presented , which leads to a substantial improvement in efficiency compared to previous pimc schemes . only this allows us to study in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical results ] first the three - state system and then complexes with longer bridges in detail , particularly with very good signal to noise ratio and larger times .",
    "a conclusion contains our main results and some remarks about subsequent work .",
    "we investigate the dynamics of a single electron moving on a chain of @xmath2 discrete sites , labeled by a discrete variable @xmath3 with spacing 1 , separated by equal distances @xmath4 but arbitrary energies @xmath5 ( see fig .  [ fig_1 ] ) .",
    "electronic motion is facilitated through tunneling between sites @xmath6 and @xmath7 , with a real tunneling amplitude @xmath8 .",
    "the electronic coordinate can then be expressed as @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "the position operator thus is equivalent to the spin @xmath11 operator @xmath12 with @xmath13 denoting the ( orthonormal ) localized electronic states . in terms of electron transfer , @xmath14 and",
    "@xmath15 represent the donor and acceptor , respectively , while the other states are referred to as the bridge states .",
    "the free @xmath1-level system ( @xmath1ls ) hamiltonian can then be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 describes the energetic distribution of the electronic sites according to @xmath18 while @xmath19 governs the tunneling , @xmath20 we already note here that the propagation of the free @xmath1-level system is most conveniently performed not in the site representation used above , but rather in the eigenstate representation of @xmath21 ( for details see sec .",
    "[ sec : simulation method ] ) .",
    "this is completely equivalent to the transformation between ( localized ) wannier states and delocalized molecular orbitals ( bloch states ) in infinite tight binding lattices .",
    "the site representation is particularly suited , however , to include the interaction with solvent and vibronic degrees of freedom which later on will be integrated out . for this purpose ,",
    "we embed the @xmath1ls in a system - plus - reservoir model , leading to the total hamiltonian @xcite @xmath22 the residual degrees of freedom are thus modeled by an infinite collection of harmonic oscillators , @xmath23 , which bilinearly couple to the position of the electron ( @xmath24 ) .",

    "@xcite , this `` standard preparation '' often used in et experiments is especially suitable for a theoretical description of thermal transfer rates .    the present formulation can easily be extended in order to describe the impact of an external time dependent driving force .",
    "this as well as abandoning the restriction to nearest neighbor coupling will be the subject of a subsequent paper .",
    "the path integral representation provides a formally exact expression for the dynamics of the electronic population and is thus the starting point for a numerically exact monte - carlo ( mc ) scheme .",

    "@xcite , the dynamics of the population for a spin-@xmath11-boson system can be cast exactly into the form of a retarded non - local ( in time ) master equation @xmath56 with time dependent transition rates @xmath57 the laplace transforms of which are given by appropriate cluster functions . provided the dissipative influence is sufficiently strong or temperature sufficiently high , the electronic dynamics ( [ exactme ] ) can be simplified to a conventional master equation .",
    "in essence , one invokes a coarse graining procedure in time so that after some initial transient motion , i.e.  for @xmath58 , the population dynamics obeys @xmath59 here , the nearest neighbor transition rates @xmath60 are related to sequential hopping processes , while @xmath61 describes direct transfer from donor to acceptor without any real populations in the bridge states ( superexchange ) .    in the case",
    "studied here in more detail , namely , degenerate donor and acceptor energies ( @xmath62 ) , degenerate bridge energies ( @xmath63 ) , and nearest neighbor tunneling with @xmath32 , the number of independent rates shrinks considerably .",

    ". coherent transport ( superexchange ) would be accounted for by additional rate contributions in the upper and lower triangular of @xmath79 .    according to eq .",

    ". the equilibrium occupation probabilities are boltzmann distributed with respect to an effective electronic parameter @xmath89 which , for strong damping and/or higher temperatures , converges with the physical bias @xmath90 @xcite .",

    "( [ bridgeme ] ) or the more general expression ( [ convme ] ) which in the appropriate parameter range gives an accurate description of the exact dynamics for times @xmath29 larger than some transient time scale @xmath91 .",
    "the corresponding expressions for @xmath92 are given in app .",
    "[ app : expressions for the populations ] .",
    "hence , once mc data for the populations are generated , the associated rate constants are obtained by fitting the electronic dynamics obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ bridgeme ] ) and ( [ matrix ] ) to the numerical data . at sufficiently low temperatures ,",
    "however , coherent oscillations govern the population dynamics over a long period of time and the transfer can no longer be characterized by time independent decay rates . outside this range information about the impact of superexchange can be extracted by comparing fits to the sequential ( [ bridgeme ] ) and the complete model ( [ convme ] ) .",
    "as already noted , basically two transport channels have been found in previous studies on bridge mediated et , namely , a sequential channel and a superexchange channel . the latter one is expected to dominate for high lying and sufficiently short bridges , whereas in other cases the former one prevails .",
    "here we briefly collect available analytical results for the transitions rates , particularly for symmetric dba systems ( degenerate donor and acceptor energies , degenerate bridge states ) , to analyze our pimc results accordingly ( see sec .  [",

    "in particular , in recent experiments on molecular wires contacted with metal junctions @xcite low temperature measurements down to 30k have been performed which necessitates the inclusion of strong quantum effects also in the environment .    for this purpose",
    "we turn to the path integral representation ( [ pops_path ] ) and employ a discretization described in detail in refs .  @xcite . for the forward and backward paths",

    "unfortunately , this method is handicapped by the dynamical sign problem @xcite .",
    "it originates from quantum interferences between different system paths @xmath145 , causing a small signal - to - noise ratio of the stochastic averaging procedure : the exponential increase of the paths configuration space with the maximum real time under study results in an exponential decrease of the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "various procedures to mitigate the sign problem have been proposed in the past , like maximum entropy methods @xcite , filter techniques @xcite or the multilevel blocking approach @xcite . here",
    "we employ a filter technique optimized for dissipative spin systems as suggested by egger and mak @xcite which exploits the special symmetries of the influence functional .",
    "the backbone of this approach is the observation that the absence of a self - energy like term for the quasi - classical paths @xmath146 in eq .",

    "this matrix product can be performed explicitely such that only the sum over the quantum variables @xmath158 has to be evaluated by pimc simulations .",
    "the resulting mitigation of the sign problem allows for numerically stable simulations which consume significantly less cpu time than corresponding ones evaluating the standard expression ( [ pop - discretized ] ) .",
    "moreover , another considerable speedup can be gained by optimizing the mc weight with respect to the dissipative regime ( see app .  [",
    "app : computational details ] ) .",
    "we note in passing that the above described approach also resembles the multilevel blocking strategy @xcite : on the first level , the harmonic bath degrees of freedom are integrated out , while on the second level the quasi - classical coordinates get eliminated ; the addend in eq .

    "it furthermore seems noteworthy that , while here we only present results for electronic systems with constant nearest - neighbor coupling , @xmath159 , the above outlined approach is suitable for arbitrary electronic systems as long as they can be described by a finite hilbert space .",
    "corresponding applications will be shown in a subsequent paper .",
    "next we present results for a symmetric donor - bridge - acceptor ( dba ) system ( degenerate donor and acceptor energies , degenerate bridge states with energy gap @xmath160 between bridge and donor / acceptor ) with constant nearest neighbor coupling obtained from pimc simulations as described above .",
    "albeit its simplicity this model captures essential features of bridge mediated et and can serve as a basis for more elaborate studies . in part , this work was motivated by former theoretical approaches on symmetric dba systems @xcite which , however , relied on simpler system+reservoir models and/or approximate numerical methods .",
    "in particular , in contrast to these latter , the formulation ( [ hamilton ] ) takes the dynamics of the vibronic structure of the dba compound fully into account .",
    "further , the mc approach is not plagued by the limitations of redfield theory , but rather applies also to low temperatures , slower bath modes , and stronger dissipation .",
    "hence , it reproduces in the proper limits the known analytical findings specified in sec",
    ".  [ rate ] .    clearly , the et process considered here eventually leads to thermal equilibration of the electronic sites . due to the relation between relaxation rates and conductances in stationary non - equilibrium @xcite ,",
    "our results give also insight , at least qualitatively , into et through metal - molecule - metal junctions .",
    "in fact , to get quantitative results , the present approach can in principle be extended to the latter case by eliminating the electronic states in the metal contacts as an additional bath .",
    "corresponding work is in progress .",
    "the superexchange mechanism is a truly quantum mechanical coherence phenomenon .",
    "thus , in order to investigate this scenario in more detail within the mc approach , we choose parameters such that for lower temperatures the population dynamics exhibits coherent oscillations , while for slightly higher @xmath104 , with a bath that is still quantum mechanically , a rate description is applicable .",
    "we take a damping coefficient @xmath161 well below the coherent - incoherent transition @xmath162 @xcite and a moderate cut - off frequency @xmath163 so that adiabatic effects are expected to show up .",
    "note that the cutoff frequency @xmath141 also defines the maximum of the spectral density distribution ( [ spectral ] ) , such that even frequencies somewhat larger than @xmath141 contribute .",
    "the classical reorganization energy follows as @xmath164 .",
    "accordingly , we expect superexchange , if important , to be particularly pronounced .     +   +    to confirm the proper choice of the above parameters and to fix the temperature range where a description in terms of rate constants applies , we start by presenting results for the equilibrium bridge population @xmath84 of a three - state system at a fixed bridge energy @xmath165 for varying temperature .",
    "as can be seen by comparing @xmath84 obtained from imaginary - time mc simulations with a simple boltzmann distribution , i.e.  @xmath166 $ ] , deviations occur for @xmath167 related to the strong influence of quantum delocalization ( see fig .  [ fig_2 ] ) .",
    "this triggers the tendency of coherent oscillations in the population dynamics which becomes especially obvious for an energetically degenerated bridge ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] ) . damped oscillations are clearly observable in the intermediate state for @xmath168 .",
    "these results verify that ( i ) with the above choice of parameters electronic coherent effects are crucial and ( ii ) that the et dynamics can be captured by transfer rates for @xmath169 .",
    "with respect to the bath , a typical temperature @xmath170 corresponds at the maximum @xmath171 of the spectral density to @xmath172 so that a high temperature approximation does not apply .",
    "the simulations have been performed for system times long enough and sufficient stochastical accuracy to allow for studying details of the dynamics even close to the approach of equilibrium .",
    "+   +    having fixed the proper range of parameters , we now turn to a detailed analysis of the population dynamics .",
    "first , we consider a three - state system with varying bridge energy @xmath173 and at a fixed temperature @xmath170 ( fig .",

    "approaches thermal equilibrium within the simulation period .",
    "interestingly , a bridge energy @xmath175 leads to an increase of the acceptor population almost as fast as for the degenerate case @xmath176 .",
    "this is due to the fact that for the former bridge the equilibrium population @xmath177 is larger while the bridge is still not high enough to considerably reduce the donor - bridge rate @xmath74 .",
    "the population dynamics for this system can now be analyzed with the full ( [ convme ] ) and the sequential ( [ bridgeme ] ) model to extract the rate constants for times @xmath178 .",

    "corresponding work in this direction is in progress .",
    "physically , the main issue has been the role of superexchange and sequential transport in symmetric dba compounds . here , results based on redfield theory and simplified system - bath couplings indicated different regimes for the length dependence of net transfer across the bridge comprising an exponential and an algebraic fall - off , respectively .",
    "the numerical mc data have been analyzed by exploiting the fact that ( i ) the et dynamics can in the range of parameters considered be mapped onto master equations with time independent transition rates and ( ii ) the path integral formulation reproduces the known analytical findings for these rates in certain limits . for the dba compound",
    "the parameters were chosen to guarantee strong quantum effects , i.e.  moderate dissipation , sufficiently low temperatures , and a broad distribution of bath modes .",
    "the conclusion of the numerical results together with the analytical findings is that in a symmetric dba system ( degenerate donor and acceptor energy ) even for weaker dissipation superexchange can be expected to dominate only for classical or nearly classical bath . for quantum mechanical baths",
    "as they have been studied here , it does not play a significant role for et processes that can be captured by time independent transport rates . particularly , in contrast to earlier studies we found no dominant role of the superexchange mechanism neither for relatively high lying bridges , nor for lower temperatures or more bridge sites . for quantum baths",
    "it requires extremely high lying bridge states with essentially frozen dynamics or temperatures that are so low that coherences give rise to oscillating population dynamics associated with a breakdown of a conventional rate description .",
    "experimentally , a clear observation of a changeover from tunneling to hopping dominated transfer in molecular chains has not been found yet , a fact , that may to some extent be attributed to the scenario we have revealed .",
    "the results reported in ref .",
    "@xcite show some indications but not a direct proof though , since the energetic landscape of the molecular structures changes with their length . by varying the number of bridge sites an algebraic decrease of the relaxation rate",
    "could be confirmed for shorter as well as longer bridges .",
    "based on a reduced dba model we find a changeover from a range where the donor - bridge activation limits the transfer to a domain where the nondirectional diffusive motion along the wire is decisive .",
    "previous simulations on biased three - state systems suggest in accordance with the analytical results that an energy gap between donor and acceptor ( in addition to the energy gap between the bridge and donor / acceptor ) stimulates the occurrence of superexchange .",
    "financial support was provided by the dfg ( bonn ) through an 336 - 1 and a heisenberg fellowship for ja .",

    "another significant reduction of the computational costs of the mc calculations can be obtained by optimizing the mc weight . while @xmath249 generally represents a natural choice for the mc weight , for systems with sufficiently weak damping an attractive alternative",
    "is given by @xmath250 with the real - valued matrices @xmath251 which essentially neglect all dissipative effects .",
    "although mc runs utilizing @xmath252 exhibit somewhat poorer statistics than those using @xmath253 , the switching from complex to real - valued matrices which furthermore , unlike the @xmath152 , can be calculated and stored before executing the mc moves results in a significant speedup of the simulations .",
