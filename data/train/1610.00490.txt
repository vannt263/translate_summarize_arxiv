    "a radical pair ( rp ) is a pair of transient radicals whose unpaired electron spins , one on each radical , are correlated .",
    "provided the rp is formed in a spin conserving process , such as photo - induced electron transfer in a precursor molecule , the initial spin state is known and this information evolves over time under the influence of external magnetic fields ( zeeman interactions ) as well as internal electron - electron ( exchange and dipolar ) and electron - nuclear hyperfine coupling . in the simplest reaction scheme , the rp recombines to different products depending on the electronic spin state ",
    "singlet , s or triplet , t ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the relative yields of the two products therefore contain information about the interactions experienced by the rp during its lifetime , including a dependence on the direction of the external magnetic field .",
    "this is the physical basis of the proposal that rp reactions are responsible for the magnetic compass sense of migratory birds.@xcite    there is a growing body of evidence in support of this proposal .",
    "behavioural studies have shown that migratory birds are only magnetically oriented in the presence of blue / green light.@xcite this is broadly consistent with the photo - excitation of the flavin adenine dinucleotide ( fad ) cofactors in cryptochrome proteins in the avian retina which are believed to be the precursors of the rp reactions.@xcite studies have also shown that the avian magnetic sensor is an inclination compass rather than a polarity compass : it is insensitive to inverting the direction of the magnetic field.@xcite this is consistent with time - reversal symmetry in the rp mechanism . and more recent studies have found that birds are disoriented when exposed to weak radiofrequency ( rf ) electromagnetic fields.@xcite if this were properly understood , it might perhaps provide the most compelling evidence of all for rp - based magnetoreception.@xcite however , theoretical calculations of the effect of weak rf magnetic fields on the rp mechanism are currently limited , and the existing experimental evidence is still somewhat controversial .    the effect of rf radiation on avian magnetoreception was first observed in a study by ritz _ et al._@xcite in 2004 , in which both broadband noise and single frequency electromagnetic fields were found to disrupt the ability of birds to magnetically orient . following this initial finding ,",
    "there have been a number of further experimental studies aimed at characterising the interaction between the rf magnetic field and the magnetosensor.@xcite one of the most influential of these found that irradiation at the  larmor \" frequency  the precession frequency of a free electron spin in the earth s magnetic field ( 1.4 mhz at 50 @xmath0 t )  had a special resonance effect , causing disorientation at even very weak intensity levels ( @xmath1 nt).@xcite if this were correct , it would imply that the electron spin on one of the radicals in the rp magnetosensor is coupled only to the external field , and not to any nuclear spins .",
    "this in turn would impose a stringent constraint on the identity of the rp , as there are few radicals without any nuclear spins in biological systems .",
    "however , a replication study has since failed to show the same sensitivity to larmor frequency perturbations , and found instead that broadband noise is far more effective at disrupting the avian compass.@xcite    given these conflicting experimental results , a theoretical study of how the time - dependent magnetic field component of rf radiation affects the rp spin dynamics would clearly be very useful .",
    "however , there are several obstacles to such a study .",
    "firstly , at least one ( and quite possibly both ) of the biological radicals involved is likely to have many nuclear spins with anisotropic hyperfine interactions . since the size of the hilbert space increases exponentially with the number of spins , even simulations involving a static external field are computationally expensive .",
    "secondly , if we wish to treat broadband noise perturbations , the time dependence of the external field will not be monochromatic as is required for many existing approximate methods.@xcite additionally , as noted by gauger _",
    "et al._,@xcite for a rp to exhibit the observed sensitivity to weak time - dependent fields , its lifetime must be exceedingly long .",
    "one exact method that is applicable to the problem is the numerical solution of the liouville - von neumann equation , but this becomes cripplingly computationally expensive for long simulation times and realistic rps .",
    "an alternative is provided by the compute algorithm,@xcite which addresses the need for a long simulation time by constructing the propagator for a full modulation period of the ( periodic ) rf field .",
    "we have considered using this algorithm for the present problem , but found that a large number of matrix exponentials are needed to construct the propagator when the rf field contains many fourier components , and that the expense of evaluating these exponentials becomes prohibitive when the rp contains many nuclear spins .",
    "we therefore require a new approximate method capable of treating large spin systems in the presence of weak external magnetic fields with a complex time dependence ( involving many fourier components ) .",
    "in the following sections , we shall first present and then validate such a method , based on a modified formulation of floquet theory .",
    "various versions of this theory are well known and widely used in fields ranging from solid state nuclear magnetic resonance to multiphoton spectroscopy.@xcite however , we are not aware of any previous application of floquet theory to radical pair recombination reactions in time - dependent magnetic fields .",

    "because the matrices involved are infinite dimensional , this can only be done approximately .      one way to tackle",
    "the problem is to truncate the floquet hamiltonian , including a certain number of hilbert space sized blocks and diagonalising this enlarged matrix numerically.@xcite this method may offer a practical solution when there are only one or two fourier components in the hamiltonian , but if we wish to extend the method to include thousands of values of @xmath50 and a high - dimensional hilbert space , truncating @xmath47 is no longer viable .",
    "fortunately , for the problem we shall be interested in ( a radical pair in a weak rf magnetic field ) , the time - dependent interactions are orders of magnitude smaller than the static hamiltonian @xmath51 , so we can use a perturbative method for the diagonalisation .",
    "consider for simplicity the case of a single applied fourier component @xmath52 this form of the hamiltonian makes @xmath47 block tri - diagonal , with @xmath53 in the super- and sub - diagonal blocks .",
    "if the hilbert space basis is the eigenbasis of @xmath51 , it is clear that there will be a degeneracy between a state in the @xmath54 diagonal block of @xmath47 and another in the @xmath55 block if the applied frequency @xmath56 is resonant with the energy difference between two unperturbed eigenvalues .",
    "if the oscillating field is sufficiently weak , its effect will be confined to these resonant interactions .",
    "we shall therefore assume this to be the case , and use degenerate perturbation theory to calculate the first order corrections to the states brought into resonance ( or near - resonance ) by @xmath57 .    as noted by shirley,@xcite a near - resonance between two states , @xmath58 ,",
    "means there are nearly - degenerate two - dimensional sub - spaces involving state @xmath59 in diagonal block @xmath50 and state @xmath60 in block @xmath61 .",

    "the other ( non - resonant ) energies and eigenstates are unaltered , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , and we now have an approximate eigendecomposition of @xmath47 to first order in @xmath72 .",

    "the method described above can be extended to treat more complicated situations  including degeneracies in the unperturbed system , overlapping resonances , and a larger number of fourier components , provided again that the spacing @xmath56 between these fourier components is large compared with the strength of the perturbation .",
    "the general procedure is to build and diagonalise sub - matrices including as many as possible of the resonances and the appropriate coupling terms to obtain the first order energies .",

    ". it should be apparent that each state can only appear in one nearly - degenerate sub - matrix , all of the states with which is it nearly degenerate being by extension close in energy to one another .",
    "one can construct examples to show that it may not always be possible to include _ all _ near resonances without allowing the size of the nearly - degenerate sub - matrix to exceed the size of the hilbert space .",
    "however , if the hilbert space contains @xmath74 states , it is always possible to build an @xmath75 nearly - degenerate sub - matrix of @xmath47 that contains one copy of each hilbert space state and captures ( at least ) the @xmath76 _ closest _ resonances ( and typically many more ) .",
    "assuming that the off - diagonal coupling terms in the floquet hamiltonian all have similar orders of magnitude , it is these closest resonances that will have the largest effect on the perturbed eigenvalues and eigenstates .",
    "neglecting more distant near resonances is clearly an approximation , but it is a convenient one to make , because diagonalising a hilbert space - sized sub - matrix of @xmath47 is no more expensive than diagonalising @xmath77 . since this procedure is also easily automated , it is the one we have adopted in the example calculations reported in sec .",

    "( 18 ) involving a double sum over the floquet eigenstates .",
    "the number of these eigenstates is infinite , but only a finite number of them contribute to the double sum because of the structure of @xmath79 in eq .",
    "for example , in the simple case where the approximate floquet eigenstates are those in eq .",
    "( 25 ) , the matrix element @xmath80 in eq .  ( 18 ) is only non - zero when @xmath81 is 0 or 1 and @xmath50 is 0 or @xmath82 .",

    "with this floquet machinery in hand , let us now return to the problem of simulating the spin dynamics of a rp subject to a rf magnetic perturbation .          in the absence of any dipolar or exchange coupling between the two electrons , the unperturbed hamiltonian that governs the spin evolution of a rp in the presence of a static external zeeman field is@xcite @xmath83 where the individual radical hamiltonians are @xmath84 here the first term , in which @xmath85 is the gyromagnetic ratio of the electron in radical @xmath86 , is the zeeman interaction of the electron spin @xmath87 with the static magnetic field @xmath88 .",

    "when @xmath118 is sufficiently small , the only terms that contribute come from nearly - degenerate sub - spaces of the floquet space  exactly the same sub - spaces that we encountered when diagonalising @xmath47 by degenerate perturbation theory in sec .",

    ", we can approximately evaluate the double sum in the expression for @xmath119 by only including contributions from nearly - degenerate states .",
    "indeed if @xmath133 , we need only be concerned with terms that arise from the near - degeneracies that are captured in each fourier - shifted copy of @xmath128 . to include these terms",

    "since our implementation of the floquet approximation only involves matrix operations in which the matrices are the size of the hilbert space [ see eq .",
    "( 41 ) ] , its computational cost is only a couple of times larger than that of a standard ( rf field - free ) radical pair singlet yield calculation done by hamiltonian matrix diagonalisation .",
    "a large number of such calculations have been performed in recent years involving radical pairs with as many as twenty or so nuclear spins,@xcite typically by exploiting the separability of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "any radical pair that has previously been studied in this way could clearly now be exposed to a rf magnetic field and its response studied with the help of the present floquet approximation , including the fad - tryptophan radical pair in cryptochrome that has been suggested as the origin of the magnetic compass sense of migratory birds.@xcite    insofar as the disruption of this compass sense by rf radiation is concerned , the present results in figs .",
    "6 and  7 are already rather interesting . if it is true , as suggested in ref .",
    ", that the precision of the compass arises from the narrowness of the spike at @xmath162 ( which is present in the rf field - free signal ) , then one could imagine that the many additional narrow resonances that are generated by the ( broadband ) rf field might well distract the bird from the true north - south axis and lead to disorientation .",
    "however , we should stress that these calculations were performed using vastly over - simplified models of the fad - tryptophan radical pair involving just 2 and 4 nuclear spins , and that the broadband noise used in the calculations had an intensity of @xmath178 nt in each of its @xmath187 fourier components ( giving a root - mean - square fluctuating magnetic field averaged over a cycle of 154 nt ) .",
    "the real fad - tryptophan radical pair contains many more hyperfine - coupled nuclear spins , and experimental investigations of the disorientation of birds by broadband electromagnetic noise have involved rather weaker rf magnetic fields.@xcite both of these factors ( and also the role of electron spin relaxation@xcite ) will have to be taken into account before we can draw any firm conclusions about the effect of rf radiation on the avian compass .",
    "we plan to use the present floquet theory to investigate the effect of weaker rf magnetic fields on more realistic models of the fad - tryptophan radical pair in a future article .",
    "finally , we should point out that we have simply followed earlier work@xcite in assuming that the magnetic component of the rf radiation disrupts the bird s magnetic compass .",
    "this may or may not be the case.@xcite it is also conceivable that the electric component of the radiation plays some role . in any event , we do believe that the theory we have developed here provides a practical way to study the effect of rf magnetic fields on a wide variety of radical pairs that arise in biological and also chemical@xcite systems .",

    "<S> the resulting method is found to give product yields in good agreement with exact quantum mechanical results for a variety of simple model radical pairs . </S>",
    "<S> moreover it is considerably more efficient than the exact calculation , and it can be applied to radical pairs containing significantly more nuclear spins . </S>",
