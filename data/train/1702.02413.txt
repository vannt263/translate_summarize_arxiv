    "in an open quantum system , for an intermediate coupling strength between the open quantum system and electron reservoir , the high - order tunneling processes , i.e. , the cotunneling processes can influence the electron tunneling processes and bring out novel physical properties .",
    "therefore , the electron cotunneling in open quantum systems , especially quantum dot ( qd ) molecules that being artificial molecules made from coupled qds and single molecules have been extensively studied both experimentally franceschiex , liuex , schleserex , sigristex , joex , rochex and theoretically hartmanntdia , golovachtcas , weymanntdia , elstetdia , misiornytdia , begemanntdia .",
    "particularly , the shot noise onacsex , gustavssonsex , zhangsex , zarchinsex , gustavssonsex08,okazakisex , sukhorukovstoff , thielmannst , weymannst , weymanncas , aghassicas , weymannst10 , weymannst11,carmistcas , kaasbjergst , wrzesniewskist and the full counting statistics ( fcs ) @xcite of cotunneling in qd molecules have attracted considerable attention due to they can allow one to identify the intrinsic properties of the qd molecules and access the information of electron correlation that can not be obtained from the average current measurements . for example , the transport current in the coulomb blockade regime , where the transfer of electrons is dominated by cotunneling processes , has been demonstrated experimentally onacsex , gustavssonsex , zhangsex , zarchinsex , gustavssonsex08,okazakisex and theoretically sukhorukovstoff , thielmannst , weymannst , weymanncas , aghassicas , weymannst10,weymannst11,carmistcas , kaasbjergst , wrzesniewskist to be super - poissonian noise . here",
    ", the super - poissonian distribution of electron counts has a width that is broader than its mean , whereas for a poissonian distribution the width and its mean have the same values .",
    "on the other hand , the quantum coherence , which is characterized by the off - diagonal elements of reduced density matrix of the considered system within the framework of the density matrix theory , also plays an important role in the electron tunneling through the strong quantum - coherent single molecule sukhorukovstoff , kieblichoff , lindebaumoff , urbanoff , xueoff1,xueoff2,xueoff3,xueoff4 .",
    "in particular , theoretical studies have demonstrated that the non - markovian effect of a strong quantum - coherent single molecule weakly coupled to two electron reservoirs plays an important role in the non - equilibrium electron tunneling processes , and manifests itself through the quantum coherence of single molecule @xcite .",
    "consequently , the electron tunneling through an open quantum system in the intermediate coupling strength case are mainly governed by the competition or interplay between cotunneling , sequential tunneling and quantum coherence .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the electron cotunneling processes in the coulomb blockade regime play a crucial role and has a slightly influence on the conduction and shot noise in the sequential tunneling regime where the transfer of electrons is dominated by sequential tunneling schleserex , wrzesniewskist , weymanncas0 .    outside the coulomb blockade regime , however , theoretical studies have demonstrated that the cotunneling assisted sequential tunneling processes have an important influence on the conduction @xcite and shot noise carmistcas , weymanncas .",
    "particularly , the influence of quantum coherence on the shot noise and the fcs of the cotunneling assisted sequential tunneling processes has received little attention in the previous studies .",
    "although the influence of the cotunneling assisted sequential tunneling on conduction and shot noise outside the coulomb blockade regime has received some attentions , how the cotunneling assisted sequential tunneling affects the non - markovian fcs is still an open issue , especially the influence of the competition or interplay between the quantum coherence and the cotunneling processes on the non - markovian fcs in the sequential tunneling regime has not yet been revealed .",
    "the aim of this work is thus to derive a non - markovian fcs formalism taking into account both the sequential tunneling and cotunneling based on the exact particle number resolved time - convolutionless ( tcl ) master equation and the rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory developed in references @xcite , then study the influences of the quantum coherence and the cotunneling processes on the non - markovian fcs of electron tunneling through open quantum systems in the sequential tunneling regime . for the sake of discussion , the considered open quantum system consists of a side - coupled double - quantum - dot molecule weakly coupled to two electron electrodes ( reservoirs ) , in which the quantum coherence can be tuned by modulating the hopping strength between the two qds relative to the coupling of this qd molecule with the source and drain electrodes .",
    "we numerically demonstrated that in the sequential tunneling regime the competition or interplay between the cotunneling processes and the quantum coherence in the strong quantum - coherent side - coupled double - qd molecule can occur in a range of the qd - electrode coupling strength , and has a remarkable influence on the fcs , which depends on the temperature and the left - right asymmetry of the qd - electrode coupling .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to consider the effects of the quantum coherence and the cotunneling processes on the fcs of electron tunneling through open strong quantum - coherent quantum systems even through the electron tunneling is mainly dominated by the sequential tunneling processes .",
    "we consider an open quantum system consisting of a qd molecule weakly coupled to the two electrodes ( reservoirs ) , which is described by the following hamiltonian @xmath0here , the first term @xmath1 , characterized by the two noninteracting reservoirs , stands for the hamiltonian of the two electrodes , with the energy dispersion @xmath2 , and @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) being the creation ( annihilation ) operators in the @xmath5 electrode . the second term @xmath6 , which may contain vibrational or spin degrees of freedom and different types of many - body interactions , represents the qd molecule hamiltonian , where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of electron in a quantum state denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "the third term @xmath10 describes the tunneling coupling between the qd molecule and the two electrodes , which is assumed to be a sum of bilinear terms that each create an electron in the qd molecule and annihilate one in the electrodes or vice versa .",
    "the qd - electrode coupling is assumed to be sufficiently weak , such that @xmath11 can be treated perturbatively . in the interaction representation , the equation of motion for the total density matrix reads@xmath12 \\equiv \\mathcal{l}% \\left ( t\\right ) \\rho _ { i}\\left ( t\\right ) ,",

    "particularly , in the @xmath169 case , the interplay between the electron cotunneling processes and the quantum coherence in the @xmath165 case determine the fcs properties of transport current , such as , whether the super - poissonian of the shot noise , the skewness and the kurtosis ( @xmath166 ) occur or not , and whether the signs of the values of the skewness and the kurtosis become negative from a positive value or not , see figs .",
    "3 and 4 . here , in the case of @xmath170 , the behavior of the shot noise in the @xmath171 case is mainly governed by the quantum coherence , see fig .",
    "however , these characteristics also depend on the temperature @xmath162 , i.e. , the quantum coherence will play an essential role in the electron tunneling processes with decreasing temperature , see figs .",

    "figures 5 and 6 show the influence of the left - right asymmetry of the qd - electrode coupling @xmath159 on the first four current cumulants for a given temperature @xmath153 . in the @xmath174 and @xmath175 ( the intermediate value ) cases , the range of the crossover region , in which the electron cotunneling processes decrease the values of fano factors while the quantum coherence increase that of fano factors , increases with increasing the ratio of @xmath176 to @xmath177 , see fig .",
    "5 . whereas in the @xmath178 and @xmath179 cases , the interplay between the electron cotunneling processes and the quantum coherence has a relatively remarkable influence on the high - order current cumulants with decreasing the ratio of @xmath176 to @xmath180 , and determines whether the super - poissonian of the shot noise and the kurtosis take place or not , and whether the transition of the skewness from positive to negative values occurs or not , see fig .",
    "we finally discuss the influences of the electron cotunneling processes on the first four current cumulants in the side - coupled double - qd molecule with weak quantum coherence at the hopping parameter @xmath181 . according to the qd molecule parameters , we choose the three fixed bias voltages under which the different transition processes participate in the electron tunneling , namely , @xmath182 , @xmath157 and @xmath183 correspond to the transitions between the singly - occupied @xmath184 and empty - occupied eigenstates , the transitions between the singly - occupied @xmath185 and empty - occupied eigenstates , and the transitions between the singly - occupied @xmath186 and empty - occupied eigenstates and the transitions between the two - occupied @xmath187 and singly - occupied @xmath188 eigenstates involved in the electron tunneling , respectively . in this situation ,",
    "the properties of the first four current cumulants are well determined by the electron cotunneling processes since the quantum coherence indeed has a very small influence on the values of the first four current cumulants , see figs . 7 and 8 .",
    "in the @xmath160 case , the electron cotunneling processes have a relatively obvious influence on the first four current cumulants , see fig . 7 ; whereas that in the @xmath189 case have a slight influence on the first four current cumulants , see fig .",
    "it is important to note that the electron cotunneling processes do not change the intrinsic statistical properties of current cumulants , namely , whether the super - poissonian of the current cumulants take place or not , and whether the sign transitions of the values of the skewness and the kurtosis occur or not , see figs .",
    "we have developed an efficient non - markovian fcs formalism taking into account both the sequential tunneling and cotunneling processes , and studied the influences of the quantum coherence and the cotunneling assisted sequential tunneling processes on the first four current cumulants in a side - coupled double - qd molecule . in the strong quantum - coherent side - coupled double - qd molecule , it is numerically demonstrated that in the sequential tunneling regime the competition or interplay between the cotunneling processes and the quantum coherence , which depends on the temperature of the qd molecule , the left - right asymmetry of the qd - electrode coupling and the corresponding coupling strengths , determines that whether the super - poissonian of the shot noise , the skewness and the kurtosis take place , and whether the sign transitions of the values of the skewness and the kurtosis occur .",
    "however , in the weak quantum - coherent side - coupled double - qd molecule , the cotunneling assisted sequential tunneling processes has a relatively slight influence on the statistical properties of current cumulants , which also depends on the left - right asymmetry of the qd - electrode coupling and the corresponding coupling strengths .",
    "consequently , the dependence of the fcs on the quantum coherence and the cotunneling assisted sequential tunneling processes is necessary to be considered in open strong quantum - coherent quantum systems even through the electron tunneling is mainly dominated by the sequential tunneling processes .",
