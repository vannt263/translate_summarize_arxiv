    "in two - dimensional electron systems ( 2dess ) , the ground state at the landau level filling factor @xmath2 is a ferromagnetic state where only the lowest landau level is completely filled with spin - up electrons @xcite .",
    "this spin - polarized state of a quantum hall ferromagnet is particularly interesting because the low - lying charged excitations are skyrmions , complex charged spin texture @xcite .",
    "the spin texture of a skyrmion encompasses many progressively reversed spins .",
    "its size , @xmath7 , is defined as the number of reversed spins within an elementary excitation .",
    "it is governed by the ratio , @xmath8 , of the zeeman energy , @xmath9 , limiting the number of spin flips , and the coulomb interaction energy , favoring local ferromagnetic ordering @xcite .",
    "therefore , reducing @xmath10 towards zero leads to divergence of skyrmion size .",
    "one way to achieve this interesting limiting regime is to lower the effective @xmath3 factor to nearly zero .",
    "this can be achieved either by the application of hydrostatic pressure , or as in the case of our sample by confining the 2des to an al@xmath11ga@xmath12as quantum well ( qw ) where the al composition @xmath13 is @xmath14 .    in pure gaas qws , where @xmath15 , a skyrmion size in the range @xmath16 was inferred using different experimental techniques @xcite .",
    "a large skyrmion size of @xmath17 was deduced from magnetotransport measurements under pressure @xcite , in which the limit of @xmath18 was reached . although investigation of @xmath7 using pressure seems to be very convenient for systematic exploration of the @xmath3 dependence , it is compromised by two requirements : for each @xmath3 ( pressure ) value , a separate cooldown is necessary and this leads to different disorder , and illumination of the sample is necessary to compensate for the loss of the density of 2des induced by the application of pressure .",
    "an alternative possibility is to tune @xmath3 to zero by confining the 2des to qws @xcite . using this approach , from their magnetotransport measurements in al@xmath0ga@xmath1as qw , shukla _ et al . _",
    "@xcite reported the largest ever skyrmions size @xmath19 .    nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr )",
    "has proved to be a powerful tool for confirming the existence of skyrmionic excitations @xcite .",
    "in addition , it has provided valuable information about the microscopic nature and dynamics of this many body electronic state @xcite .",
    "therefore , the nmr technique appears to be a good candidate for shedding light on the nature of the large skyrmions in qws . here , we present such an investigation .",
    "we studied the @xmath20ga nmr signal in a multiple al@xmath0ga@xmath1as qw sample , of the same composition as the one studied in ref.@xcite , at @xmath2 .",
    "the electronic polarization @xmath4 is found to be very small , causing the overlap of signals from the qws and barriers .",
    "the small @xmath5 would also inhibit the enhancement of the weak signal from qws by optically pumped nmr , justifying our use of `` conventional nmr '' .",
    "a special technique was employed to distinguish between a weak signal from the qws and one from the barriers . in these qws",
    "we observe the thermally induced depolarization of small and negative ( compared to a pure gaas qw ) spin polarizations .",
    "we argue that this can be attributed to large skyrmions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in experimental details",
    "are presented .",
    "these include descriptions of the sample , experimental setup , and essentials of nmr in qws .",
    "the small tip angle technique is described in .",
    "our findings are summarized in .",
    "finally , implications of these on the nature of elementary excitations are discussed in .",
    "we investigated a multiple - qw sample , similar to the single qw sample used in transport measurements @xcite .",
    "the results indicate that the sample is of high quality and that its @xmath3 factor is small @xcite .",
    "our sample consists of thirty 24 nm - wide al@xmath0ga@xmath1as qws bounded on each side by 132 nm - thick al@xmath21ga@xmath22as ` barriers ' which are si doped near their centers .",
    "the density of the 2d electrons confined to each of the qws is and their mobility is . the low mobility is believed to be predominantly due to impurity rather than alloy scattering @xcite .",
    "the effective @xmath3 factor for the 2d electrons in our sample is estimated to be @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that this is of the opposite sign and an order of magnitude smaller than that in the bulk gaas .",
    "the nmr spectra were recorded using a custom built nmr spectrometer . for temperatures",
    "@xmath24 above 1 k we were not able to separate the qw signal due to insufficient signal - to - noise ( @xmath25 ) ratio in this sample .",
    "the low temperature environment , down to 50 mk , was provided by a @xmath26he/@xmath27he dilution refrigerator .",
    "the rf coil was mounted into the mixing chamber of the refrigerator .",
    "this ensured good thermal contact with the sample .",
    "we used the ` bottom - tuning ' scheme in which a variable tuning capacitor was mounted as close as possible to the coil just outside of the mixing chamber .",
    "this tuning scheme minimizes the rf - losses , and so optimizes the nmr sensitivity .",
    "it allows a clear separation of the qw spectra at all temperatures below 1 k , otherwise impossible for .      in pure gaas qw samples ,",
    "previous optically pumped @xcite and conventional nmr @xcite studies have shown that nmr spectra consist of two well separated peaks originating from the nuclei located in the qws and the barriers .",
    "these peaks are distinguishable owing to a significant polarization of the electrons in the qws .",
    "this is because the hyperfine interaction between nuclei and electrons gives rise to the knight shift , @xmath28 , of the nmr line @xcite @xmath29here @xmath30 is the local spin polarization at the spatial position , @xmath31 , of the nuclei , and @xmath32 the local value of the electron density .",
    "signal from nuclei in the barriers , where the electron density is vanishingly small , will be essentially unshifted , and can be used as a zero - shift reference .",
    "the nuclei in the qws provide an nmr line whose shift is directly proportional to the average global electron polarization , @xmath33assuming uniform electronic density , @xmath34 .",
    "the effective hyperfine coupling constant , @xmath35 , can be determined experimentally from the nmr shift obtained at low temperature , high field , and at filling factors , such as @xmath36 , where the 2des is fully polarized , i.e. , @xmath37 and @xmath38 reaches its maximal value . from the values observed in pure gaas multiple qw samples@xcite , we infer that a maximum shift of @xmath39 24 khz is expected for our sample .",
    "this allows for direct deduction of the spin polarization of 2des from @xmath40 .",
    "( color online ) the nmr spectrum , containing the signal from nuclei in both qws and barriers , measured at @xmath41 and @xmath42 mk .",
    "the spectrum was recorded using the effective pulse length and the repetition times that favor the barriers signal ( sharp narrow peak ) . ]",
    "however , if the effective electronic @xmath3 factor is lowered , the absolute polarization , @xmath43 , is smaller for the same value of @xmath44 and @xmath45 . as a consequence ,",
    "the separation between the barrier and qw signals in nmr spectra is smaller as well . indeed , as illustrated in , the nmr spectrum of the sample exhibits an asymmetric peak which contains contributions from the qws ( a broad , background - like signal ) and from the barriers ( a strong , narrow peak ) .",
    "nevertheless , the two contributions can be discerned by exploiting their different nuclear spin - lattice relaxation times ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the hyperfine interaction responsible for the shift of the nmr line induces the @xmath46 relaxation as well @xcite .",
    "it contains spin operators of the form @xmath47 which produce simultaneous electronic , @xmath48 , and nuclear spin , @xmath49 , flips .",
    "in addition , the existence of closely spaced electron levels with energy separation comparable to the nuclear zeeman gap is required by energy conservation .",
    "such levels are provided by the additional degrees of freedom present in a real 2des .",
    "these degrees of freedom could be generally ascribed to disorder and/or the presence of skyrmions in the electronic ground state in the vicinity of @xmath2 @xcite . therefore , even in the limit of vanishing @xmath3 factor , we expect significantly faster @xmath46 relaxation of the nuclei in the qw compared to those in the barriers , due mostly to the existence of low energy excitations , such as skyrmions .",
    "this is further enhanced by the thermal depolarization .",
    "the nmr spectra are recorded by the small tip angle free induction decay ( fid ) technique that we describe in detail in .",
    "the essence of this technique is that the signal intensity depends strongly on the effective pulse strength and the ratio of the repetition time between consecutive spectrum acquisitions and the relaxation time .",
    "thus , one can find the tip angle that maximizes the @xmath25 ratio , referred to as the _ ernst angle _",
    "@xcite ( in the following sub - section ) .",
    "the two contributions to the nmr spectrum , having different relaxation rates , have different ernst angles , as shown in .",
    "therefore , we can obtain the pure qw spectrum from the analysis of the pulse strength dependence of the lineshape .",
    "the effective pulse strength , i.e. total pulse power , was varied in two ways : by varying the time of the pulse duration and by varying the voltage of the pulse , keeping its time duration fixed .",
    "the latter method is preferred since it eliminates the possible artifacts associated with the variable bandwidth coverage of the pulse .",
    "we remark here that the small @xmath3 factor also inhibits the application of the optical pumping technique .",
    "thus , the only way to separate signal from nuclei in qws and so probe the @xmath5 in these samples is by the conventional nmr , exploiting the different @xmath46  relaxation times of nuclei in the qws and barriers .",
    "the technique providing this `` @xmath46 contrast '' is described in detail in the next sub - section .",
    "the small tip angle pulse method exploits the fact that the intensity of the nmr spectra depends strongly on the effective power @xmath50 of the excitation pulse and the ratio of the repetition time @xmath51 between consecutive spectrum acquisitions and the relaxation time @xmath52 . in a conventional nmr experiment",
    "each data acquisition consists of an excitation and detection of magnetization , and usually enough time is allowed between acquisitions that the equilibrium spin temperature is fully restored , @xmath53 .",
    "the spins are manipulated in several standard ways of which the two simplest examples are : fid and hahn echo sequences . usually , these sequences are repeated many times with a delay of @xmath54 so that the signal is averaged in order to improve the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "as the echo sequence is rather incompatible with the small tip angles , in what follows we will only discuss the fid case used in our experiment .",
    "following the exact @xmath55 pulse the maximum signal intensity is obtained if @xmath56 . in general , if the pulse angle is smaller and/or if one does not wait this long between consecutive acquisitions the signal will be smaller .",
    "however , one can show that the @xmath25 ratio can be improved if short @xmath54 are used concomitantly with a smaller tip angle , if @xmath57 @xcite . in this case",
    "the benefit in  from increasing the rate of data accumulation more than makes up for loss of signal from not allowing the magnetization to return to its thermal equilibrium value .",
    "furthermore , the amplitude of the signal depends strongly on the spin - lattice relaxation rate .",
    "therefore , tuning the excitation angle strength allows for separation of spectral components with distinct relaxation rates by optimizing respective signal amplitudes , as illustrated in .",
    "this is demonstrated in a more quantitative way in the next paragraph .",
    "( color online ) the contour - image plot of the signal - to - noise ratio as a function of an effective pulse tip angle and the ratio of the repetition time , @xmath58 , to the spin - lattice relaxation time , @xmath59 .",
    "the relative value of the @xmath25 in percents is denoted on the contours . ]",
    "we consider the signal magnitude after consecutive data acquisitions . following an excitation pulse , the longitudinal magnetization @xmath60 of a system of spin 1/2 nuclei recovers towards its equilibrium value @xmath61 by exponential relaxation , @xmath62where",
    "@xmath63 is the initial magnetization . after a time @xmath54",
    "the magnetization will recover to @xmath64 , prior to the next pulse which will rotate the magnetization by the angle @xmath65 and restart the acquisition process .",
    "after this pulse the longitudinal magnetization will be equal to @xmath66 , which is the starting magnetization of the following relaxation .",
    "thus , in the steady state the above equation ( at @xmath67 ) becomes solving for @xmath68 , one obtains @xmath69 in an experiment we detect a _",
    "transverse _ magnetization just after the pulse , which is @xmath70 .",
    "thus , the signal magnitude is proportional to @xmath71the noise is inversely proportional to the square root of the number of averages @xmath72 .",
    "thus , in a given time it is proportional to @xmath73 . the signal to",
    "noise ratio is thus @xmath74 in one can see that by concomitant shortening of the tip angle and the repetition time , one can maintain a high @xmath25  ratio . from  it is easy to find that the tip angle that maximizes the @xmath25 ratio is given by @xmath75we remark that the detection of this angle allows one to determine @xmath76 much faster than in the standard measurement",
    "however , a @xmath76 value determined in such a fashion certainly has higher error . in practice , in a non - homogeneous and complicated system such as qw samples this method of @xmath46 determination turns out to be unsuitable .",
    "( color online ) the @xmath20ga nmr spectra at @xmath77 taken by free induction decay .",
    "the effective pulse length dependence of the spectra is used to distinguish the signal of nuclei in qws from the signal of those in barriers . ]",
    "( color online ) the temperature dependence of the qw signal .",
    "the zero of the frequency ( i.e. , the spin polarization ) scale is defined by the position of the signal from barriers containing no free electrons .",
    "the position of the spectra defines the knight shift , @xmath78 . ]    full spectra at @xmath77 recorded using various effective pulse lengths at 65 mk are shown in .",
    "it is evident that the spectral shape is strongly dependent on the effective pulse angle , as previously discussed .",
    "nonetheless , two main features can be discerned : a narrow gaussian - like component at lower frequencies and a broad asymmetric component .",
    "the narrow component dominates the spectra obtained using weak excitation pulses .",
    "this implies that the signal comes from the nuclei with a very long relaxation time , @xmath79 , as suggested by and .",
    "indeed , signal from the nuclei in the barriers is expected to relax extremely slowly compared to the signal from qw .",
    "this is due to lack of free electrons in the barriers .",
    "furthermore , the linewidth of this component is found to be , comparable to well separated barrier signals observed in other pure gaas qw samples @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the broad asymmetric component dominates the spectra obtained using stronger excitation pulses , implying that this signal comes from the nuclei with relatively short relaxation times .",
    "this is expected for nuclei in qws due to their hyperfine coupling with a significant number of free electrons .",
    "therefore , the signal from the qws can be obtained using stronger excitation pulses .",
    "this allows a separation of the two signals .",
    "the details of the procedure will be discussed next .",
    "we first record the spectra using weak excitation pulses to obtain the precise spectral component from the barriers at a given temperature .",
    "the signal is fitted to a gaussian that is then subtracted from the spectra recorded using strong excitation pulses .",
    "spectra obtained in this manner contain only information from the nuclei in qws , as illustrated in .",
    "after subtraction of the barriers contribution from the nmr spectra we are left with a pure qw lineshape . its temperature evolution is shown in .",
    "we point out that the spectral position defines the knight shift , @xmath78 , as discussed in .",
    "however , the most striking observation is the appearance of the significant linewidth broadening with decreasing temperature .",
    "the broadening is asymmetric .",
    "the notable width of the lower temperature spectra implies a significant distribution of the spin polarizations .",
    "such a distribution can be attributed to sample inhomogeneities and/or to large skyrmions .",
    "we will address this issue in .",
    "in addition to the linewidth broadening , decreasing temperature induces a shift of the average position of the qw signal .",
    "the temperature dependence of the linewidth and the lineposition are summarized in .",
    "we point out that the frequency scales of the figures can be directly related to the spin polarization , as the hyperfine coupling constant is known from measurements in pure gaas qw samples . for our sample",
    "corresponds to a full polarization , as discussed in .",
    "it is evident from that the polarization is very small , @xmath80 of the full polarization , and _ negative _ compared to pure gaas qws .",
    "this result is consistent with the small value of @xmath81 reported in for a sample of the same al concentration .",
    "one should note that this @xmath3 value is much smaller in magnitude compared to @xmath82 in pure gaas qws and has the opposite sign .    at the filling factor in the vicinity of but not at , @xmath2",
    "the spin polarization is expected to be significantly smaller than at @xmath2 in the presence of large skyrmions @xcite .",
    "we did not observe such a drop in polarization , possibly due to a small absolute value of the polarization at @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , direct deduction of the skyrmion size was impossible .",
    "we remark that reduced spin polarization of the skyrmions at @xmath2 has already been reported even in pure gaas multiple qw samples @xcite presenting otherwise full polarization in the low-@xmath45 limit at @xmath84 and 2/3 @xcite .",
    "the full polarization @xmath85  is approached only in very pure and homogeneous samples , preferably with smaller numbers of quantum wells@xcite .",
    "the doped qws are intrinsically less pure than pure gaas ones .",
    "thus , the observed reduction of @xmath86 is indeed much stronger and essentially no significant @xmath87dependence of the shift and of the linewidth is observed in the range of @xmath88 .",
    "for this reason , a comparison of the @xmath89 dependence with the one observed in ref .",
    "@xcite is inconclusive .",
    "( color online ) the temperature dependence ( thermal depolarization ) of the linewidth and lineposition ( the shift , @xmath90 ) of qw signal at @xmath77 shown in .",
    "the dotted lines are guide to the eye .",
    "the solid line is the fit to @xmath91 function as described in the text . ]      since the temperature dependence of the shift probes low - lying excitations , a significant amount of theoretical work has been devoted to calculating the @xmath92 dependence of the electron spin polarization precisely at @xmath2 @xcite . in a simple model at @xmath2 for noninteracting 2d electrons with the chemical potential in the middle of the zeeman gap ,",
    "@xmath93 is given by @xmath94 in , we plot a fit to the above equation with @xmath10 as an adjustable parameter . using the @xmath10 value obtained from the fit we find that @xmath95 .",
    "however , in pure gaas qws it was necessary to use a zeeman splitting enhanced by a factor of @xmath96 to fit the data @xcite .",
    "this enhancement reveals the importance of interaction at . assuming that the @xmath10 in our sample is enhanced by the same factor , we obtain @xmath97 , which is the same value as reported by shukla _ _ et al.__@xcite . in other words",
    ", it appears that the nature of the interactions responsible for the gap enhancement at @xmath2 is similar in both gaas and qws .",
    "next , we will discuss the origin of the linewidth broadening at low temperatures .",
    "two possible mechanisms are sample inhomogeneities and/or large skyrmions",
    ". dynamic measurements of the spin - spin decoherence time ( @xmath6 ) are employed to differentiate between these .",
    "we have observed a very fast decay rate @xmath98 of the amplitude of the spin echo ( shorter than the dead time for signal detection , @xmath99s ) , preventing us from pursuing more quantitative studies .",
    "such dynamic fluctuations can not be induced by the static sample inhomogeneities , since we were able to record spectra using free induction decay .",
    "therefore , it is likely that our observations reveal some aspect of skyrmion physics .",
    "mainly , a very fast @xmath98 rate reveals that the spin polarization distribution presents strong dynamic fluctuations at the time scale of the spacing between the rf pulses ( a few microseconds ) .",
    "these dynamic fluctuations can be associated with spin - textured domains that are dynamic themselves and/or whose @xmath89 distribution moves rapidly on the nmr time scale .",
    "we measured comparable @xmath5 and full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) values at @xmath2 and @xmath100 , which favors the dynamic @xmath89 distribution scenario .",
    "furthermore , in such a scenario , @xmath5 would be significantly diminished as is observed here and discussed in .",
    "the most likely scenario is that dynamic variations of @xmath101  are realized through skyrmion motion , meaning that they are concomitant with dynamic skyrmions .",
    "this dynamic picture is endorsed by the temperature dependence of the linewidth ( fwhm ) .",
    "well - known nmr phenomena of motional narrowing implying that the fwhm is strongly affected by the dynamics of the nuclei@xcite .",
    "since the nuclei are spatially localized in the lattice , any observed dynamical effect must be related to the dynamics of electrons in qws , i.e. , to the motion of delocalized quasiparticles or skyrmions .",
    "the fwhm depicts an evolution of the skyrmion dynamics from the motionally - narrowed to the frozen regimes with decreasing temperature @xcite .",
    "the slow skyrmion dynamics tend to increase the linewidth .",
    "however , the fwhm should ultimately decrease at very low @xmath45 since the exponentially small number of skyrmions cancels out the effect of the slow dynamics @xcite .",
    "therefore , the temperature dependence of the fwhm is expected to be nonmonotonic .",
    "as portrayed in , the fwhm continuously increases with decreasing temperature implying a progressive slowing down of skyrmion dynamics .",
    "lack of the peak in the fwhm _ versus _ @xmath45 graph indicates that skyrmions do not become fully localized @xcite down to @xmath102 mk , the lowest @xmath45 in our experiment .",
    "we remark further that the lack of the peak argues against the impurity scenario , since one expects impurities to be effective in pinning quasiparticles at such a low temperature .",
    "in a quantum wells sample with a small @xmath3 tensor we have employed a special nmr technique to allow the distinction between a weak qw signal and the barrier signal .",
    "we determined the polarization of the electrons in the qws and its temperature evolution .",
    "the measurements directly confirm the theoretical prediction ( ) of a small , positive value for the @xmath3 factor @xcite .",
    "a very broad distribution of spin polarization was found in the sample .",
    "this can be attributed to sample inhomogeneities or to large skyrmions . the latter possibility is favored by observation of a very fast @xmath103 rate , indicating that the spin polarization distribution is dynamic rather than static",

    "<S> a nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) study is reported of multiple ( 30 ) al@xmath0ga@xmath1as quantum well ( qw ) sample near the landau level filling factor @xmath2 . in these qws </S>",
    "<S> the effective @xmath3 factor is nearly zero . </S>",
    "<S> this can lead to two effects : vanishing electronic polarization @xmath4 and skyrmionic excitations composed of a huge number of spins . as small @xmath5 values cause an overlap of the nmr signals from the qw and barriers , a special technique was employed to allow these two signals to be distinguished . </S>",
    "<S> the qw signal corresponds to a small , negative , and very broad distribution of spin polarization that exhibits thermally induced depolarization . </S>",
    "<S> such a distribution can be attributed to sample inhomogeneities and/or to large skyrmions , the latter possibility being favored by observation of a very fast @xmath6 rate . </S>"
