    "we continue the analysis of ( linear ) aspects of the black hole stability problem in the spirit of earlier works by dyatlov , vasy and the author @xcite by studying linear _ tensor - valued _ wave equations on perturbations of schwarzschild - de sitter spaces with spacetime dimension @xmath0 ; in particular , this includes wave equations for differential forms and symmetric 2-tensors . in our main result",
    ", we establish exponential decay up to a finite - dimensional space of resonances :    [ thmintrowaveexpansion ] let @xmath1 denote a kerr - de sitter spacetime in @xmath0 spacetime dimensions , with small angular momentum .",
    "let @xmath2 be a subbundle of the bundle @xmath3 of ( covariant ) rank @xmath4 tensors on @xmath5 , so that the tensor wave operator @xmath6 acts on sections of @xmath7 ; for instance , one can take @xmath7 to be equal to @xmath3 , symmetric rank @xmath4-tensors or differential forms of degree @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath8 denote a small neighborhood of the domain of outer communications , bounded beyond but close to the cosmological and the black hole horizons by spacelike boundaries , and let @xmath9 be a smooth time coordinate on @xmath8 . see figure  [ figdomain ] for the setup .",
    "then for any @xmath10 , the wave equation @xmath11 has a unique global forward solution ( supported in the causal future of @xmath12 ) @xmath13 , and @xmath14 has an asymptotic expansion @xmath15 where @xmath16 , the resonant states @xmath17 , only depending on @xmath18 , are smooth functions of the spatial coordinates and @xmath19 are resonances with @xmath20 ( whose multiplicity is @xmath21 and for which the space of resonant states has dimension @xmath22 ) , while @xmath23 is exponentially decaying , for @xmath24 small ; we measure the size of sections of @xmath7 by means of a @xmath9-independent positive definite inner product .",
    "the same result holds true if we add any stationary @xmath25-th order term to @xmath26 , and one can also add stationary first order terms which are either small or subject to natural , but somewhat technical condition , which we explain in remark  [ rmkfirstorderperturbation ] .",
    "in fact , we can even work on spacetimes which merely _ approach a stationary perturbation of schwarzschild - de sitter space exponentially fast_. see section  [ secproof ] for the form of the schwarzschild - de sitter metric and the precise assumptions on regularity and asymptotics of perturbations , for details on the setup , and theorem  [ thmwaveexpansion ] for the full statement of theorem  [ thmintrowaveexpansion ] .     and",
    "theorem  [ thmwaveexpansion ] below . shown",
    "are the black hole horizon @xmath27 and cosmological horizon @xmath28 , beyond which we put an artificial spacelike hypersurface @xmath29 with two connected components .",
    "the hypersurface @xmath30 plays the role of a cauchy hypersurface , and the forcing as well as the solution to the wave equation are supported in its causal future . the domain @xmath8 is bounded by the hypersurfaces @xmath30 and @xmath29 .",
    "the ` point at future infinity ' in the usual penrose diagrammatic representation is shown blown - up here , since the wave operator is well - behaved ( namely , a b - operator in the sense of melrose @xcite ) on the blown - up space , and the asymptotic information is encoded on the front face @xmath31 of the blow - up . ]",
    "the resonances and resonant states depend strongly on the precise form of the operator and which bundle one is working on . in the case of the trivial bundle , thus considering scalar waves , they were computed in the kerr - de sitter setting by dyatlov @xcite , following work by s barreto and zworski @xcite as well as bony and hfner @xcite . in recent work with vasy @xcite ,",
    "we compute the resonances for the hodge dalembertian on differential forms , which equals the tensor wave operator plus a zeroth order curvature term : we show that there is only one resonance @xmath32 in @xmath33 , with multiplicity @xmath34 , and we canonically identify the @xmath25-resonant states with cohomological information of the underlying spacetime .",
    "note however that @xcite deals with a very general class of warped product type spacetimes with asymptotically hyperbolic ends , while the present paper is only concerned with ( perturbations of ) schwarzschild - de sitter spacetimes .",
    "we remark that in general one expects that @xmath6 on a bundle @xmath7 as in theorem  [ thmintrowaveexpansion ] has resonances in @xmath35 , thus causing linear waves to grow exponentially in time .",
    "we point out that if there are no resonances for @xmath18 ( plus lower order terms ) in @xmath33 , thus solutions decay exponentially , we can combine theorem  [ thmintrowaveexpansion ] with the framework for quasilinear wave - type equations developed by the author @xcite and in collaboration with vasy @xcite and immediately obtain the _ global solvability of quasilinear equations_. this also works if there is merely a simple resonance at @xmath36 which is annihilated by the nonlinearity .",
    "the point of view from which we approach the proof of theorem  [ thmintrowaveexpansion ] was originally developed by vasy  @xcite and extended by vasy and the author @xcite . in the context of scalar waves ,",
    "more general and precise versions of theorem  [ thmintrowaveexpansion ] are known , see the references below .",
    "thus , the main novelty is that we give a conceptually transparent framework that allows us to deal with tensor - valued waves on black hole spacetimes , where the natural inner product on the tensor bundle induced by the spacetime metric is not positive definite .",
    "the central motivation for the study of such waves is the _ black hole stability problem _ , see the lecture notes by dafermos and rodnianski @xcite for details .",
    "notice that in order to obtain energy estimates for waves , one needs to work with positive inner products on the tensor bundle , relative to which however @xmath26 is in general not well - behaved : most severely , it is in general far from being symmetric at the trapped set , which prevents the use of estimates at normally hyperbolic trapping . in the context of black hole spacetimes ,",
    "such estimates were pioneered by wunsch and zworski @xcite and dyatlov @xcite . on a pragmatic level , we show that one can conjugate @xmath26 by a suitable @xmath25-th order pseudodifferential operator so as to make the conjugated operator ( almost ) symmetric at the trapped set with respect to a positive definite inner product , and one can then directly apply dyatlov s results @xcite .",
    "the conceptually correct point of view to accomplish this conjugation is that of _ pseudodifferential inner products _ , which we introduce in this paper .    roughly speaking ,",
    "pseudodifferential inner products replace ordinary inner products @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is an inner product on the fibers of @xmath7 , mapping @xmath7 into its anti - dual @xmath39 , by ` inner products ' of the form @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is a zeroth order pseudodifferential operator mapping sections of @xmath7 into sections of @xmath39 .",
    "thus , we gain a significant amount of flexibility , since we can allow the inner product to _ depend on the position in phase space _ , rather than merely on the position in the base : indeed , the principal symbol @xmath42 is an inner product on the vector bundle @xmath43 over @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the projection .",
    "one can define adjoints of operators @xmath46 ( e.g.  @xmath47 ) , acting on sections of @xmath7 , relative to a pseudodifferential inner product @xmath48 , denoted @xmath49 , which are well - defined modulo smoothing operators .",
    "moreover , there is an invariant symbolic calculus involving the _ subprincipal operator _",
    "@xmath50 , which is a first order differential operator on @xmath44 acting on sections of @xmath43 that invariantly encodes the subprincipal part of @xmath51 , for computing principal symbols of commutators and imaginary parts of such operators . in the case that @xmath51 is principally scalar and real , the principal symbol of @xmath52 then vanishes in some conic subset of phase space @xmath44 if and only if @xmath53 does , which in turn can be reinterpreted as saying that the principal symbol of @xmath54 vanishes there , where @xmath38 is an ordinary inner product on @xmath7 , and @xmath55 is a suitably chosen elliptic operator . in the case considered in theorem  [ thmintrowaveexpansion ] then , it turns out that the subprincipal operator of @xmath18 on tensors , decomposed into parts acting on tangential and normal tensors according to the product decompositions @xmath56 and @xmath57 , at the trapped set equals the derivative along the hamilton vector field @xmath58 , @xmath59 the dual metric function , plus a _ nilpotent _ zeroth order term .",
    "this then enables one to choose a positive definite inner product @xmath60 on @xmath43 relative to which @xmath61 is arbitrarily close to being symmetric at the trapped set ; thus with @xmath62 , the operator @xmath18 is arbitrarily close to being symmetric with respect to the pseudodifferential inner product @xmath48 .",
    "hence , one can indeed appeal to dyatlov s results on spectral gaps by considering a conjugate of @xmath18 , which is the central ingredient in the proof of theorem  [ thmintrowaveexpansion ] .",
    "the study of non - scalar waves on black hole backgrounds has focused primarily on maxwell s equations : sterbenz and tataru @xcite showed local energy decay for maxwell s equations on a class of spherically symmetric asymptotically flat spacetimes including schwarzschild .",
    "blue @xcite established conformal energy and pointwise decay estimates in the exterior of the schwarzschild black hole ; andersson and blue @xcite proved similar estimates on slowly rotating kerr spacetimes .",
    "these followed earlier results for schwarzschild by inglese and nicolo @xcite on energy and pointwise bounds for integer spin fields in the far exterior of the schwarzschild black hole , and by bachelot @xcite , who proved scattering for electromagnetic perturbations .",
    "finster , kamran , smoller and yau @xcite proved local pointwise decay for dirac waves on kerr .",
    "there are further works which in particular establish bounds for certain components of the maxwell field , see donniger , schlag and soffer @xcite and whiting @xcite .",
    "dafermos @xcite , @xcite studied the non - linear einstein - maxwell - scalar field system under the assumption of spherical symmetry .",
    "the framework in which we describe resonances was introduced by vasy @xcite . in the scalar",
    "setting , this can directly be combined with estimates at normally hyperbolic trapping @xcite to obtain resonance expansions for scalar waves . on exact kerr - de sitter space ,",
    "dyatlov proved a significant strengthening of this in @xcite , obtaining a full resonance expansion for scalar waves , improving on the result of bony and hfner @xcite in the schwarzschild - de sitter setting , which in turn followed s barreto and zworski @xcite .",
    "vasy @xcite proved the meromorphic continuation of the resolvent of the laplacian on differential forms on asymptotically hyperbolic spaces , and the fact that the underlying analysis of @xcite works on sections of vector bundles just as it does on functions is fundamental for the present paper .",
    "in section  [ secproof ] , we recall the schwarzschild - de sitter metric and its extension past the horizons , put it into the framework of @xcite for the study of asymptotics of waves , and establish the normally hyperbolic nature of its trapping .",
    "we proceed to sketch the proof of theorem  [ thmintrowaveexpansion ] , leaving the discussion of high energy estimates at the trapped set to the subsequent sections , which comprise the central part of the paper : we introduce pseudodifferential inner products on vector bundles in full generality in section  [ secpsdoinner ] , and we use the theory developed there in section  [ secsubprincipallaplace ] to study pseudodifferential inner products for wave operators on tensor bundles , uncovering the nilpotent nature of the subprincipal operator of @xmath26 on schwarzschild - de sitter space at the trapping in section  [ subsecsds ] and thereby finishing the proof of theorem  [ thmintrowaveexpansion ] .",
    "i am very grateful to semyon dyatlov , andrs vasy and alexandr zamorzaev for many useful discussions .",
    "we recall the form of the @xmath63-dimensional schwarzschild - de sitter metric , @xmath0 : we equip @xmath64 , @xmath65 , with @xmath66 defined below , with the metric @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the round metric on the sphere @xmath69 , and @xmath70 , @xmath71 , with @xmath72 the black hole mass and @xmath73 the cosmological constant @xmath74 .",
    "the assumption @xmath75 guarantees that @xmath76 has two unique positive roots @xmath77 .",
    "indeed , let @xmath78 .",
    "then @xmath79 has a unique positive root @xmath80^{1/(n-3)}$ ] , @xmath81 for @xmath82 and @xmath83 for @xmath84 ; moreover , @xmath85 for @xmath86 small and @xmath87 as @xmath88 , thus the existence of the roots @xmath77 of @xmath89 is equivalent to the requirement @xmath90 , which is equivalent to .",
    "define @xmath91 , thus @xmath92 , and let @xmath93 near @xmath66 , so @xmath94 there .",
    "then the metric @xmath95 can be written as @xmath96 we introduce a new time variable @xmath97 , with @xmath98 near @xmath99 . then @xmath100 near @xmath99 , which extends as a non - degenerate lorentzian metric to a neighborhood @xmath101 of @xmath5 , where @xmath102 .",
    "we will consider the cauchy problem for the tensor wave equation in the domain @xmath103 , @xmath104_r \\times { \\mathbb{s}}^{n-2}.\\ ] ] thus , @xmath8 bounded by the cauchy surface @xmath105 , which is spacelike , and by the hypersurface @xmath106 , which has two spacelike components , one lying beyond the black hole ( @xmath107 ) and the other beyond the cosmological ( @xmath108 ) horizon ; see figure  [ figdomain ] .    for the purpose of analysis on spacetimes close to ( but",
    "not necessarily asymptotically equal to ! ) schwarzschild - de sitter space , we encode the uniform ( asymptotically stationary ) structure of the spacetime by working on a compactified model , which puts the problem into the setting of melrose s _ b - analysis _ , see @xcite : define @xmath109 , and bordify @xmath110 to a manifold @xmath111 with boundary by adding @xmath112 as the boundary at future infinity and declaring @xmath113 to be a smooth boundary defining function .",
    "the metric @xmath95 becomes a smooth _ lorentzian b - metric _ on @xmath111 : if @xmath114 denotes coordinate differentials on @xmath115 , then @xmath95 is a linear combination of @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 with coefficients which are smooth on @xmath111 , and @xmath95 , written in such coordinates , is a non - degenerate matrix ( with lorentzian signature ) _ up to and including _ @xmath112 .",
    "invariantly , we have the lie algebra @xmath119 of _ b - vector fields _ , which are the vector fields tangent to the boundary , spanned by @xmath120 and @xmath121 ; elements of @xmath119 are sections of a natural vector bundle @xmath122 , the b - tangent bundle , and we have the dual bundle @xmath123 , spanned by @xmath124 and @xmath114 .",
    "thus , @xmath125 is a smooth non - degenerate section of the symmetric second tensor power @xmath126 .",
    "now , given a complex vector bundle @xmath127 of finite rank , equip it with an arbitrary hermitian inner product and any smooth b - connection , which gives a notion of differentiating sections of @xmath7 along b - vector fields ; over @xmath8 ( which has compact closure in @xmath111 ) , all choices of inner products are equivalent",
    ". we can then define the b - sobolev space @xmath128 for @xmath129 to consist of all sections of @xmath7 over @xmath8 which are square integrable ( with respect to the volume density @xmath130 induced by the metric @xmath125 ) together with all of its b - derivatives up to order @xmath131 , and extend this to all @xmath132 by duality and interpolation , or via the use of b - pseudodifferential operators . for the forward problem for the wave equation , we work on spaces of functions which vanish in the past of @xmath30 and which extend across @xmath29 .",
    "thus , we work with the space @xmath133 of distributions @xmath134 which are extendible distributions at @xmath29 and supported distributions at @xmath30 , i.e.  they are restrictions to @xmath8 of distributions on @xmath111 which are supported in @xmath135 .",
    "see hrmander ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix  b ) for details .",
    "we also have weighted b - sobolev spaces @xmath136 , likewise for spaces of supported / extendible distributions .",
    "note that the b - sobolev spaces @xmath137 are independent of the choice of boundary defining function @xmath113 in that the choice @xmath138 , @xmath139 smooth , @xmath140 , while it changes the smooth structure of @xmath111 , yields the same spaces @xmath137 with equivalent norms .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of waves will be encoded on the boundary @xmath141 at future infinity of @xmath8 , that is , on @xmath142_r\\times{\\mathbb{s}}^{n-2},\\ ] ] which is a smooth manifold with boundary .",
    "similarly to the above definitions , we can define sobolev spaces ( including semiclassical versions of these ) with supported / extendible character at the boundary .",

    "] changing @xmath143 so as to make it invariant under time translations does not affect this condition , so let us assume @xmath143 is @xmath9-invariant .",
    "we will consider the wave operator @xmath18 acting on sections of the bundle @xmath3 of covariant tensors of rank @xmath4 over @xmath8 .",
    "we assume that @xmath143 and @xmath95 are close ( in the @xmath146 sense for sufficiently high @xmath4 ) , is exponentially approaching a stationary metric close to the schwarzschild - de sitter metric , so for instance perturbations ( within this setting ) of kerr - de sitter spaces are allowed . ] so that the dynamical and geometric structure of @xmath125 is close to that of @xmath95 : most importantly , the nature of the trapping for @xmath143 ( and thus for @xmath125 ) is still normally hyperbolic ,-",
    "normal hyperbolicity for every @xmath147 of the trapping for schwarzschild - de sitter in all spacetime dimensions below , and @xmath147-normal hyperbolicity ( for large , but finite @xmath147 ) is structurally stable under perturbations of the metric , see dyatlov  @xcite and hirsch , shub and pugh @xcite . ] and the subprincipal operator ( see section  [ subsecinvariantsubprincipal ] ) of @xmath18 at the trapped set , while not necessarily having the nilpotent structure alluded to in the introduction and explained in section  [ subsecsds ] , has small imaginary part relative to ( the symbol of ) a pseudodifferential inner product on @xmath3 .",
    "we then have :    [ thmwaveexpansion ] in the above notation , if @xmath143 is sufficiently close to the schwarzschild - de sitter metric @xmath95 , then there exist @xmath148 and @xmath24 as well as a finite set @xmath149 , @xmath20 , integers @xmath21 and @xmath150 , and smooth functions @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , such that the following holds : the equation @xmath155 has a unique solution @xmath156 , which has an asymptotic expansion @xmath157 where @xmath158 is a cutoff function , i.e.  @xmath159 near @xmath112 and @xmath160 near the cauchy surface @xmath30 , and @xmath16 , while the remainder term is @xmath161 .",
    "the same result holds true if we restrict to a subbundle of @xmath3 which is preserved by the action of @xmath26 , for instance the degree @xmath4 form bundle , or the symmetric rank @xmath4 tensor bundle .",
    "if @xmath162 , @xmath86 , is a smooth ( conormal ) @xmath163-valued potential ( without restriction on its size ) , the analogous result holds for @xmath18 replaced by @xmath164 .",
    "we may even change @xmath18 by adding a first order b - differential operator @xmath165 acting on @xmath3 with coefficients which are elements of @xmath166 , provided either the coefficients of @xmath165 are small , or the subprincipal operator of @xmath167 is sufficiently close to being symmetric with respect to a pseudodifferential inner product on @xmath3 , see remark  [ rmkfirstorderperturbation ] .",
    "the numbers @xmath168 are called _ resonances _ or _ quasinormal modes _ , and the functions @xmath17 _ resonant states_. they have been computed in various special cases ; see the discussion in the introduction for references .",
    "the threshold regularity @xmath169 is related to the dynamics of the flow of the hamiltonian vector field @xmath58 of the dual metric function @xmath59 ( i.e.  @xmath170 , with @xmath59 the dual metric of @xmath125 ) near the horizons which are generalized _ radial sets _ , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition  2.1 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath169 can easily be made explicit , but this is not the point of the present paper .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thmwaveexpansion ] proceeds in the same way as the proof of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  2.20 ) in the scalar setting , so we shall be brief : denote by @xmath171 the normal operator of @xmath18 : we freeze the coefficients of @xmath172 at @xmath141 and thus obtain a dilation - invariant operator @xmath171 , with @xmath173 being an operator whose coefficients decay exponentially ( in @xmath9 ) by assumption on the structure of @xmath125 . denote by @xmath174 the mellin transformed normal operator family , depending holomorphically on @xmath175 , which we obtain from @xmath171 by replacing @xmath176 by @xmath177 . to @xmath178 , we can express the normal operator with respect to the new defining function in terms of the normal operator with respect to @xmath113 , namely it equals @xmath179 .",

    "since @xmath125 is close to the schwarzschild - de sitter metric , it suffices ( by the dynamical stability of the trapping ) to obtain such a bound for the schwarzschild - de sitter metric @xmath95 . while this bound is impossible to obtain directly for the full range of schwarzschild - de sitter spacetimes , we show in section  [ subsecsds ] how it can be obtained if we use pseudodifferential products .",

    "if such a bound does not hold for any @xmath754 , the dispersion of waves concentrated at the trapped set caused by the normally hyperbolic nature of the trapping is expected to be too weak to counteract the exponential growth caused by the subprincipal part of @xmath747 , and correspondingly one does not expect a spectral gap .",
    "notice that the growth of parallel sections is an averaged condition in that it involves the behavior of the parallel transport for large times , while the choice of @xmath311-inner products as explained above is a local condition and depends on the pointwise structure of @xmath749 ; thus , establishing spectral gaps only using averaged data is an interesting open problem , even in the scalar setting ."
