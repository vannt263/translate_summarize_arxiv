    "recent experiments in d - wave bscco superconductors showed some interesting phenomena in the presence of impurities on copper sites .",
    "in particular , stm showed a strong variation of the electron density of states ( dos ) near ni  @xcite and zn  @xcite atoms in bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath00@xmath1 . using nmr kondo - like effect was in cuprates doped by zn , ni or li impurities both above and below @xmath2  @xcite , and an uncompensated spin @xmath3 appeared near the zn impurity  @xcite .",
    "although it is tempting to explain the tunneling experiments by the pure potential scattering  @xcite , there are several key features which are not easily justified within this model ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . for example , the low frequency resonance can be achieved only for a large non - universal value of the potential coupling  @xcite . on the other hand , the kondo screening gives a natural low energy scale and the results appear to be much more robust with respect to the variation of the composition and coupling constants  @xcite .",
    "we note that using stm data alone it is not possible to distinguish between the potential and kondo scattering mechanisms leading to the variations of the dos .",
    "the screened impurity acts as a spin singlet and is therefore similar to the potential scatterrer .",
    "however the unitarity limit in the kondo case occurs at the coupling slightly exceeding the critical value , which is not necessarily large .",
    "the other important advantage of the kondo mechanism is that it simultaneously explains nmr and stm measurements .",
    "the cuprates are unconventional superconductors with linearly vanishing density of states near the four nodes .",
    "the usual kondo picture is not valid there  @xcite . in particular",
    ", there is no phase transition if the spin - spin coupling is relatively small so the impurity remains effectively decoupled from quasiparticles .",
    "if the dos vanishes at the fermi surface slower than the square root of energy : @xmath4 . however if @xmath5 this simple picture does nt work .",
    "thus both numerical renormalization group ( nrg )  @xcite and dynamic large n multichannel approach  @xcite showed that the kondo phase exists only if the hamiltonian does nt respect the particle - hole symmetry . in the symmetric case the spin - spin coupling always flows to zero . on the other hand , in  @xcite it was argued that if the particle - hole symmetry is preserved , then there is no screening at the level of the total impurity susceptibility @xmath6 at @xmath7 , but still there is a quenching of the impurity spin and @xmath8 in the zero temperature limit .",
    "the model hamiltonian for a pure superconductor to be exploited in the present paper is : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the kinetic energy and superconducting gap respectively , @xmath12=@xmath13 is the gorkov - nambu spinor .",
    "the interaction with a single impurity can be expressed in the coqblin - schrieffer form  @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the potential and spin - spin coupling constants , @xmath17 is the effective impurity spinor in the nambu representation ( it is related to the creation and annihilation operators by @xmath18 ) .",
    "the single impurity occupancy corresponds to the condition : @xmath19 in fact , there is an additional potential like scattering term proportional to @xmath16 in ( [ hint1 ] ) , however , it disappears in the path - integral formulation of the problem  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath20 then the hamiltonian ( [ ho ] ) respects the particle hole symmetry , i.e. under the transformation @xmath21 both the kinetic energy @xmath22 and the order parameter @xmath23 change their signs .",
    "this additional symmetry is not generic , it disappears if either chemical potential or second neighbor hopping becomes not zero .",
    "however this notion is very useful , since in many cases the particle - hole asymmetry can be treated as a perturbation .",
    "the model above but without the potential scattering term was already examined by c. cassanello and e. fradkin in  @xcite .",
    "the authors concluded that there is a kondo phase transition above some critical spin - spin coupling @xmath24 .",
    "they found that for the linear dos , the kondo temperature vanishes exponentially near the phase transition .",
    "also it was argued that in the kondo phase the impurity susceptibility vanishes at @xmath25 as @xmath26 .",
    "however , these results were obtained even in the particle - hole symmetric case .",
    "we find similar dependences of the kondo temperature and susceptibility only if the particle - hole symmetry is broken , e.g. by non - zero potential scattering .",
    "the reason in such a discrepancy is that the symmetrization of the action with respect to positive and negative frequencies used in  @xcite is not valid , which resulted in essential inconsistencies there .",
    "we come back to this point in the next section .",
    "the other difference between our approaches is that we start from the hamiltonian ( [ ho ] ) instead of its linearized nodal version  @xcite .",
    "this is important for the analysis because ( i ) the particle - hole asymmetry ( @xmath27 or @xmath28 ) is essentially a high energy effect , ( ii ) the spatial structure of the scattering can not be reproduced from the nodal version of the hamiltonian , ( iii ) the expressions for the @xmath29-matrix and green functions are much more apparent in the original gorkov - nambu representation than in that of the nodal particles .",
    "although at the later stage we use linearized version of the hamiltonian for the sake of simplicity and analyticity , the results can be easily generalized for the arbitrary spectrum of quasiparticles  @xcite .",
    "we also study in detail the phase diagram at finite temperature , where the effects of particle hole asymmetry become crucial .",
    "the model is generalized to the case of an arbitrary exponent @xmath30 larger than @xmath31 , where the simple withoff - fradkin picture  @xcite is invalid .",
    "we would also mention that the problem addressed here but for the anderson magnetic impurity was studied in  @xcite using the slave - boson mean field approach .",
    "the impurity potential had been chosen in such a way that only zero or single occupancy was allowed . as a result",
    "the hamiltonian was strongly particle - hole asymmetric from the beginning .",
    "it was found that this model predicts the kondo effect and the particle hole symmetry of the pure superconductor is not important .",
    "the model also results in a low - energy resonance in the dos and is consistent with the experimental spatial dependence .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "in section ii we solve the saddle point equations and study the phase diagram in the space of the potential and spin - spin couplings @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "it is found that the transition to the kondo phase occurs only in the particle - hole asymmetric case . at zero temperature the critical spin - spin coupling @xmath24 saturates as @xmath32 if @xmath33 and diverges as @xmath34 if @xmath35 . in the case of a d - wave superconductor ( @xmath36 ) , the kondo temperature is found to vanish exponentially near @xmath37 in agreement with  @xcite . at the fixed temperature and for @xmath33 the crossover from the high temperature ( @xmath38 ) to the low temperature ( @xmath39 ) limit occurs at @xmath16 diverging as @xmath32 .    in section iii",
    "we examine the expressions for the local and total magnetic susceptibilities of the impurity and the quasiparticle density of states .",
    "it is shown that in the particle - hole symmetric case for @xmath33 and @xmath40 the local susceptibility diverges as @xmath25 , but @xmath8 , while @xmath41 . in the kondo phase @xmath42 saturates and @xmath43 . both @xmath42 and @xmath44 as functions of temperature have a maximum at @xmath45 . in the end of the section we derive the expression for the induced quasiparticle dos near the impurity .",
    "it is shown that in the kondo phase the effective scattering matrix has a pole at the frequency close to the kondo temperature ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the crucial difference between this model and simple potential scattering  @xcite is that the unitarity limit here occurs at finite magnitude of the spin - spin coupling @xmath47 , which does nt have to be large .",
    "section iv is devoted to the discussion of the modifications of the model for the case of a non - magnetic impurity , which induces a staggered magnetization nearby .",
    "this study is motivated by the nmr experiments  @xcite unambiguously showing existence of the magnetic moments in the vicinity of the zn atom , which substitutes cu . from the theoretical point of view",
    "this issue is interesting , since the spin - spin interaction becomes non - local . assuming that the effective spin is induced on the first cu neighbors of zn we show that the action has four different saddle points , and for the whole range of coupling constants the configuration with the @xmath48 symmetry of the order parameter corresponds to the lowest energy .",
    "the critical spin - spin coupling for the non - local spin is found to decrease with @xmath15 as opposed to the local spin case .",
    "the spatial dependence of the induced dos is also different .",
    "it is characteristic for the scattering on the four rather than the single site and gives an excellent agreement with the stm experiments  @xcite .",
    "after the standard hubbard stratonovich decoupling and integrating out fermion fields the partition function for the system with the hamiltonian given by ( [ ho ] ) and ( [ hint1 ] ) becomes a functional integral over the auxiliary fields @xmath49 and @xmath50 with the action : @xmath51 where trace is taken over all antiperiodic functions of  @xmath52 @xmath53 ; @xmath54 is the quasiparticle green function in the presence of the potential scattering on the impurity :    @xmath55    and @xmath56 is the free electron green function , which in the momentum space is equal to : @xmath57 the lagrange multiplier @xmath50 in ( [ 1 ] ) enforces the single occupancy constraint . in general @xmath49 is a complex field , however its phase can be reabsorbed into @xmath50 by a simple gauge transformation  @xcite .",
    "it is not hard to show that in a d - wave superconductor the free particle green function at @xmath58 is expressed as  @xcite : @xmath59 with @xmath60 and @xmath61 being even and odd functions of frequency , respectively . if the free hamiltonian is also invariant under the particle - hole transformation then @xmath62 .",
    "for simplicity we assume this is the case .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that the models with @xmath27 and @xmath63 can be mapped to each other .",
    "explicitly @xmath64 is given by @xmath65 at small frequencies the main contribution to @xmath60 comes from the wavevectors close to the nodes , so we can do the summation over @xmath66 and obtain : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the mean geometrical velocity near the nodes and @xmath69 denoting the upper cutoff of the order of @xmath70 . for the hamiltonian ( [ ho ] ) with @xmath20 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 .    from the equation ( [ 2 ] ) we see that the action ( [ 1 ] ) splits into two identical terms for the spin up and spin down polarizations so that : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the number of the spin channels , @xmath75 note that there is an additional term `` @xmath76 '' in ( [ main ] ) , which enforces the symmetry @xmath77 in the absence of the potential scattering . in ( [ main ] )",
    "we find it more convenient to use a gauge , where @xmath49 is complex , but @xmath50 is time independent . in the large @xmath78 limit",
    "the action is given by the saddle point approximation  @xcite .",
    "so it is necessary to find the stationary point with respect to the auxiliary fields @xmath50 and @xmath49 .",
    "let us start with @xmath50 : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is an infinitesimal parameter showing the correct procedure of closing the wick s contour .",
    "if @xmath81 then for any @xmath49 : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the fermi function . in fact",
    "this identity is just a consequence of the particle - hole symmetry .",
    "if @xmath27 the relation above generalizes to @xmath84 so in the absence of the potential scattering , @xmath85 at the saddle point . with help of ( [ qq ] ) ,",
    "we write the saddle point condition as follows : @xmath86 so that both sums become convergent at @xmath87 .",
    "clearly @xmath85 as long as @xmath88 .",
    "near the phase transition the order parameter @xmath89 is small and therefore @xmath50 is also small .",
    "after introducing dimensionless parameters @xmath90 and using @xmath91 we can simplify ( [ 1u ] ) to : @xmath92 where @xmath93 ^ 2 + u^2x^2}. \\label{eq:23}\\ ] ] the function @xmath17 increases linearly with @xmath15 at small @xmath15 and saturates at @xmath31 for large @xmath15 . at finite temperature and small @xmath15 or @xmath89 ,",
    "( [ 2u ] ) shows that @xmath94 up to logarithmic corrections , i.e. instead of ( [ 2u ] ) we can write : @xmath95 as long as @xmath29 is not too small we can ignore weak logarithmic dependence of the rhs of ( [ 3u ] ) on @xmath29 , and @xmath50 is a decreasing function of temperature .",
    "this picture is valid down to @xmath96 at this temperature @xmath50 saturates becoming @xmath97 the quantity @xmath98 gives the low - energy scale of the problem and further will be identified with the kondo temperature .",
    "note that it has an exponential dependence on the order parameter @xmath89 .",
    "the second equation defining the saddle point is obtained differentiating ( [ main ] ) with respect to @xmath49 .",
    "there is always a trivial solution @xmath99 , the second one is found from : @xmath100 where the summation over discrete @xmath101 was transformed to the integration , which is valid in the low temperature limit .",
    "assuming @xmath91 and @xmath102 , i.e. the system is in the vicinity of the phase transition , ( [ seffphi ] ) becomes : @xmath103 the rhs of ( [ eq:10 ] ) is bounded from above with the value @xmath104 achieved at @xmath99 and @xmath81 .",
    "therefore we conclude that if @xmath16 is less than the critical value @xmath24 given by @xmath105 then @xmath99 at the saddle point and the impurity is decoupled from quasiparticles .",
    "the critical coupling is an increasing function of @xmath15 . in particular @xmath106 as @xmath16 increases and becomes larger than @xmath24 , the nontrivial solution of ( [ eq:10 ] ) becomes relevant , since it defines the minimum of the action as a function of @xmath107 . near the critical point @xmath47 we have : @xmath108 at the transition @xmath109 and according to ( [ t_k ] ) its asymptotics are : @xmath110    these expressions show that close to the phase transition @xmath98 is exponentially small and as long as @xmath111 , the system is in the regime where the effective impurity energy @xmath50 is a temperature dependent quantity ( see ( [ 3u ] ) ) : @xmath112 the exponential behavior of the kondo temperature and the effective impurity energy has been predicted already in  @xcite .",
    "however , we note that this is the case only if the particle - hole symmetry is broken . in the particle - hole symmetric case @xmath50 and @xmath98 are identically equal to zero for the whole range of the magnetic coupling constant . in the regime ,",
    "where @xmath113 , @xmath50 saturates at the value proportional to @xmath98 ( [ 24 ] ) .    as we noted in the introduction ,",
    "our results are quite different from those derived in  @xcite .",
    "we believe there are several weak points in those treatments .",
    "in particular , the action ( 2.28 ) in  @xcite clearly does nt give the zero saddle point for the effective impurity energy @xmath114 at the particle - hole symmetric case @xmath115 ( we use notations of  @xcite here ) .",
    "as a result the action in that form does nt predict the curie law for the susceptibility even when the impurity is free . on the other hand",
    "this symmetrization is appropriate for finding the order parameter @xmath49 and the critical coupling @xmath116 ( @xmath24 in our notation ) .",
    "that is why we find completely different expressions for the kondo temperature as compared to  @xcite , while the critical coupling @xmath24 remains the same . in their second paper",
    "@xcite , the authors considered only the linear density of states ( see ( 3.33 ) therein ) and treated the action more carefully . however the saddle point equation ( 5.3 ) in  @xcite is still incorrect .",
    "it gives the nonzero value of @xmath114 in the particle - hole symmetric case ( see e.g. ( 5.9 ) with @xmath117 ) .",
    "it seems that there was lost a contribution to ( 5.3 ) from the residue at @xmath118 , and hence an implicit particle - hole asymmetry was introduced .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the phase diagram in the @xmath119 plane .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the phase transition , while the dash and dot lines show the contours of the constant @xmath98 . at fixed @xmath29 the latter lines separate high - temperature ( @xmath120 ) and the low - temperature ( @xmath121 ) regions .",
    "here we would like to emphasize that the phase diagram with the dash line being a boundary is reminiscent to that obtained by nrg  @xcite .",
    "this probably indicates that the large n - theory is not very reliable in the zero temperature limit .",
    "it is also important to note that the curve @xmath122 , corresponding to @xmath123const is very insensitive to the variations of the latter .",
    "thus the dot and the dash lines corresponding to @xmath124 and @xmath125 almost coincide .    [ fig1 ]",
    "the solid line ( @xmath37 ) corresponds to the kondo transition at zero temperature . at this coupling the order parameter",
    "@xmath49 first becomes non - zero .",
    "the dot and the dash line are the contours of constant kondo temperature @xmath126 and @xmath125 respectively .",
    "the critical spin - spin coupling @xmath24 remains finite at @xmath81 , however in the particle - hole symmetric case there is no real transition to the kondo phase since at any finite temperature the crossover value of @xmath16 ( dash and dot lines ) diverges as @xmath127 . for @xmath128",
    "the phase diagram is similar to this , while for @xmath35 the zero temperature boundary between the kondo and curie phases is analogous to the dash line .",
    "the solid line in this case does nt represent any real phase transition.,title=\"fig:\",width=272 ]      before we proceed further with d - wave superconductors , let us generalize obtained in the large n limit expressions to the case of vanishing density of states with an arbitrary exponent : @xmath129 i.e. the action is still given by the equation ( [ main ] ) but the unperturbed green function @xmath130 is now as follows : @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the hypergeometric function .",
    "high and low frequency asymptotics of @xmath133 are @xmath134 for @xmath135 the problem was studied in detail in  @xcite .",
    "both the consequent analysis and numerical results  @xcite show that the effects of the particle - hole asymmetry become crucial for @xmath136 . here",
    "only this situation will be considered . doing the same steps as before we find the critical @xmath16 , where @xmath89 first becomes nonzero , is @xmath137 in the case of the small potential scattering @xmath15 , the order parameter near the phase transition is : @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the digamma function .",
    "note that regardless of @xmath30 , @xmath107 is proportional to @xmath140 .",
    "however , when @xmath50 is considered , it is necessary to distinguish between @xmath128 and @xmath35 . in the former case",
    "one can define the kondo temperature : @xmath141^{-{1\\over 1-r } } , \\label{eq:13k}\\ ] ] where @xmath142 is the riemann zeta function , @xmath143 for @xmath128 near the phase transition we have : @xmath144 above the kondo temperature @xmath50 increases with @xmath29 , while for @xmath145 it saturates at the value : @xmath146 it is easy to check that the expressions for @xmath36 obtained earlier are consistent with these formulas .",
    "the picture becomes quite different for @xmath35 .",
    "if the order parameter is sufficiently small , @xmath50 can be found from : @xmath147 provided the rhs of ( [ eq:16a ] ) is less than 1 , this equation has a solution with @xmath94 , i.e. vanishing as @xmath29 goes to zero . on the other hand if the rhs becomes greater than 1 , this equation has no solution and at zero temperature at this point there is a phase transition to the kondo phase .",
    "thus for @xmath30 slightly greater than @xmath104 and @xmath148 the new critical coupling @xmath149 is @xmath150 for @xmath151 we have @xmath152 .",
    "the diverging behavior of @xmath149 at @xmath32 is in fact very similar to that of the crossover spin - spin coupling for @xmath36 at finite temperature ( see dash line on fig .",
    "however , for @xmath35 this divergence exists even in the zero temperature limit .",
    "at this point we get another evidence that the large - n theory might be not reliable at small temperatures for @xmath33 .",
    "namely , the nrg analysis shows that @xmath36 is not a special point in the phase diagram  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the saddle point results predict that the curve similar to the dash ( not solid ) line in figure 1 represents the actual transition to the kondo phase for @xmath35 . at the same time at finite temperature",
    "the mean field phase diagram is qualitatively similar to the nrg result  @xcite . and moreover , for @xmath30 close to 1 the contours @xmath153 are very insensitive to the value of @xmath29 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "we start this section from calculating a local magnetic susceptibility at zero magnetic field . in the saddle point approximation",
    "it is given by : @xmath154 using ( [ seffeps ] ) we immediately get : @xmath155 this expression becomes particularly simple if there is no potential scattering and @xmath85 ( we always assume that the temperature is small compared to the cutoff , i.e. @xmath156 ) : @xmath157 it is not surprising that for @xmath99 in the physical case @xmath74 , ( [ eq:13 ] ) gives one half of the usual curie constant . this feature is an artifact of the large n techniques applied here . for @xmath128 instead of ( [ eq:13 ] )",
    "we have @xmath158^{1\\over 1-r } \\label{eq:13d}\\\\ & & \\chi_{loc}\\approx { 2 n\\beta^{2r-1}\\cos^2{\\pi r\\over 2}\\over \\phi^4 \\pi^{2(r+1 ) } ( r+1)^2 } { 4^r",

    "so both susceptibilities increase with @xmath161 .",
    "note that @xmath42 is clearly a sublinear function of inverse temperature even in the particle - hole symmetric case . for @xmath162 and @xmath163",
    "the kondo temperature becomes large enough and both susceptibilities have a maximum at @xmath164 .",
    "the local susceptibility saturates at @xmath165 , while @xmath43 ( see eq .",

    "so both susceptibilities increase with @xmath161 .",
    "note that @xmath42 is clearly a sublinear function of inverse temperature even in the particle - hole symmetric case . for @xmath162 and @xmath163",
    "the kondo temperature becomes large enough and both susceptibilities have a maximum at @xmath164 .",
    "the local susceptibility saturates at @xmath165 , while @xmath43 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq:40]).,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    on the other hand for @xmath35 the local susceptibility in the particle - hole symmetric case is completely described by the curie law .",
    "the formulas above are valid as long as @xmath166 . for @xmath33",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath38 . below the kondo temperature @xmath42 saturates at : @xmath167    the temperature dependence of @xmath42 for @xmath36 is plotted on the top graph on figure 2 .",
    "this function is non - monotonic with the maximum occurring at @xmath45 .    using equation ( [ eq:14 ] ) , it is not hard to calculate a correction to @xmath168 for @xmath39 : @xmath169 showing that @xmath42 decreases at @xmath25 for @xmath145 .",
    "the local susceptibility is the response function to the magnetic field coupled only to the impurity .",
    "we will also consider here the impurity susceptibility which additionally includes the contribution from the nearby electron cloud .    assuming that g - factors of band and impurity electrons are the same we see that the only effect of the magnetic field @xmath170 on the action ( [ main ] ) is the shift of the imaginary frequency @xmath171 for the spin up states and @xmath172 for the spin down states .",
    "therefore , the impurity susceptibility at zero field is : @xmath173 if @xmath85 , expression above reduces to : @xmath174 note that @xmath44 asymptotically approaches curie law at @xmath25 , contrary to ( [ eq:13 ] ) where @xmath8 .",
    "this peculiarity was already predicted in  @xcite , however in the later work  @xcite , @xmath42 was found to be proportional to the inverse temperature without any logarithmic corrections .",
    "the controversy between the mean - field and nrg results can not be resolved considering the next terms in the @xmath175 expansion near the saddle point .",
    "in fact , it is easy to show , that for @xmath81 at each order of the perturbation series for @xmath42 , a multiplier @xmath176 is generated in the denominator",
    ". therefore the sublinear dependence of @xmath177 is generic for the large @xmath78 approach .",
    "probably the reason for the discrepancy between this work and  @xcite is that the large @xmath78 expansion is asymptotic in the particle - hole symmetric case and for @xmath128 , and it diverges as temperature goes to zero .    for @xmath35 near @xmath37 , @xmath178 .",
    "while for @xmath128 there is a crossover between @xmath179 and @xmath180 @xmath181 and @xmath182 respectively , @xmath183 is defined in ( [ eq:13d ] ) . so the impurity is partially screened .",
    "we note again that these results are valid only for @xmath136 , otherwise there is a transition to kondo phase even in the particle - hole symmetric case .    below",
    "the kondo temperature @xmath44 goes to zero in agrement with  @xcite .",
    "for example at @xmath36 : @xmath184    impurity susceptibility as a function of temperature is plotted on the bottom graph on figure 2 .",
    "another manifestation of the coupling between quasiparticles and impurity is the change of the electron density of states , which is given by the imaginary part of the effective green function : @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the real frequency with an infinitesimal positive imaginary part ,    @xmath187    the scattering matrix @xmath188 , corresponding to the kondo contribution is equal to : @xmath189 note that a similar form for @xmath190 was found in  @xcite for the case of an anderson impurity below the kondo temperature . using ( [ 2 ] ) , ( [ eq:18 ] ) can be simplified further : @xmath191 we adopted the notation : @xmath192 @xmath193    the spatial dependence of dos coincides with that obtained earlier for the case of the pure classical scattering  @xcite .",
    "we note that at small frequencies ( @xmath194 ) , there is a maximum at the nearest neighbors of the impurity and at @xmath195 the asymptotic behavior of the dos is @xmath196 .",
    "also it is easy to show that if the resonance frequency is much smaller than the superconducting gap , the spatially integrated dos remains particle - hole symmetric .",
    "it is determined by the momenta in the vicinity of the nodes and therefore this result is valid regardless the microscopical details of the model such as chemical potential , existence of second - neighbor hopping matrix elements , etc .",
    "clearly the @xmath190-matrix for the kondo scattering channel has a pole at the frequency @xmath46 .",
    "if @xmath197 , i.e. @xmath47 , the resonant levels corresponding to the poles in @xmath198 and @xmath199 become very narrow and they have roughly lorentzian shape . in the opposite limit @xmath200 ,",
    "the resonance corresponding to @xmath201 disappears and ( [ eq:18c ] ) results in the fano lineshape in agreement with  @xcite .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the scattering on a strong classical magnet gives two identical peaks at positive and negative frequencies and additional weak potential coupling results in the weak splitting of those  @xcite . in the kondo case , even at small @xmath15 the spatial structure of the resonances at positive and negative frequency",
    "is highly asymmetric .",
    "in this section we focus on the situation , when the spin is not located on the impurity site , but rather it is a staggered moment distributed nearby . the main motivation to",
    "this investigation comes from the nmr experiments  @xcite with non - magnetic zn or li impurities in a bssco .",
    "the effective strength of the induced moments rapidly decreases with the distance  @xcite , therefore it is reasonable to assume that the spins are sitting only on the first nearest neighbors .    in this way",
    "the new interacting part of the hamiltonian becomes :    @xmath202    where @xmath203 denotes the subset of the sites closest to the @xmath204 .",
    "contrary to the spin - spin coupling which is strongest on the nearest neighbors of the impurity , the potential scattering is dominated by the local term , therefore its form is unchanged as compared to ( [ hint1 ] ) . repeating the same steps as before and using the static approximation",
    "we obtain : @xmath205    this action can be also evaluated in the saddle point approximation . the important difference with the local spin case",
    "is that there are four nontrivial saddle points corresponding to @xmath206 ( @xmath207 ) , @xmath48 ( @xmath208 ) , and @xmath209 ( @xmath210 ; @xmath211 ) symmetry of the order parameter , the latter case being twice degenerate . on the figure 3",
    "we show the dependence of the critical coupling @xmath24 on the potential scattering for the order parameter of the @xmath206 and @xmath48 symmetry ( @xmath209 case is always in between ) and for the local spin .",
    "clearly , for the whole range of @xmath15 , @xmath48 order has a lower @xmath24 and as a result a smaller action .",
    "also , contrary to the local spin case , @xmath24 decreases with @xmath15 .",
    "this phenomenon is readily understood since the potential scattering increases the quasiparticle density of states on the nearest neighbors  @xcite , where the magnetic moments are located , and hence enhances the effective spin - spin coupling .",
    "it is interesting to note , that the effective dos of the `` bath '' electrons for the @xmath48-wave saddle point in the absence of potential scattering term is proportional to @xmath212 and not @xmath213 due to green functions cancellation near the nodes  @xcite .",
    "however this feature is not important for our consequent analysis .",
    "[ fig3 ]   always has a lower critical coupling @xmath24 and the smallest action .",
    "contrary to the local spin case the kondo transition occurs at lower value of @xmath16 with increasing @xmath15.,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ]    both local and impurity magnetic susceptibility practically do nt change as compared to the local spin case , since they are sensitive to the value of the impurity spin and not to its distribution .",
    "the situation is quite different for the density of states . in particular , for the spin scattering part and @xmath48-wave order parameter ( [ eq:18c ] ) generalizes to @xmath214 where : @xmath215 @xmath216 with @xmath217 .",
    "the resonance frequency is approximately equal to the kondo temperature as in the local spin case .",
    "if the potential scattering is not too large @xmath218 then the spatial dependence of the dos is determined by the interference from the scattering on the four nearest neighbors to the impurity sites .",
    "in particular , for the @xmath48 ( @xmath206 ) order parameter , the resonance corresponding to @xmath199 ( @xmath219 ) matrix gives the largest dos on the impurity site @xmath220 , local maximum on the second neighbors and very small signal on the first neighbors  @xcite .",
    "this behavior is in the excellent agreement with the experiments , where the spatial distribution of dos near the zn impurity was directly observed  @xcite . also at @xmath221",
    "the density of states vanishes as @xmath222 , i.e. much faster than for the the local spin case .",
    "the spatially integrated dos is generically particle - hole asymmetric .",
    "in particular it can be shown that if @xmath218 and @xmath197 then at the resonance frequency the integrated dos is : @xmath223 simple power counting shows that ( [ 101 ] ) and ( [ 102 ] ) converge near the nodes",
    ". therefore the ratio of the spatially integrated dos is nonuniversal and while for particle - hole symmetric spectrum @xmath224 , it decreases with the doping crossing 1 at some moment . for comparison we will give the results for the local spin : @xmath225 this expressions logarithmically diverge when @xmath226 and @xmath70 become small , therefore it is necessary to put a low energy cutoff of the order of frequency .",
    "the integrals mainly sit on the nodes and @xmath227 if @xmath186 is small .",
    "physically this differences are related to the slow ( @xmath228 ) dependence of the dos on the distance for a single spin , while for the nonlocal scattering the dos rapidly decreases away from the impurity and the main contribution to the spatial integrals comes from the short distances or high momenta .",
    "let us say a few words about strong potential scattering case @xmath151 . as we see from the figure 3",
    ", the critical kondo coupling @xmath24 goes to zero , in fact as @xmath229 up to logarithmic corrections .",
    "therefore for the most values of @xmath16 the system is in the kondo phase .",
    "if @xmath16 is not too large , then the order parameter @xmath89 and the kondo temperature are small enough so that the condition @xmath218 fulfills . as a result",
    "the spatial structure of the dos remains the same as if there is no potential scattering .",
    "this contradicts the naive idea of the `` hard - wall '' impurity , which prohibits large dos at @xmath220 . and",
    "the reason , why this argument is not correct is that the energy scale @xmath98 is so small that the potential scattering is irrelevant .",
    "if both conditions @xmath151 and @xmath230 are fulfilled then @xmath231 might be greater than 1 . in this case",
    "the kondo scattering occurs on the almost frozen density of states created by the potential scatterer and apart from small variations the spatial structures of the kondo and potential resonances coincide .",
    "but we emphasize again that in order to have this situation both @xmath15 and @xmath16 should be very large .",
    "we have studied the screening of a magnetic impurity in @xmath48-wave superconductors .",
    "it is found that there is a kondo transition , which occurs only if the particle - hole symmetry is distorted , e.g. by the potential scattering .",
    "the kondo temperature is exponentially small near the critical coupling in agreement with  @xcite .",
    "however , at finite but small temperature the crossover from the regime @xmath38 , where the impurity spin is not screened to @xmath39 occurs at qualitatively different values of the magnetic coupling @xmath16 ( see ( fig .",
    "1 ) ) , in particular @xmath232 if the potential coupling @xmath32 . in the particle - hole symmetric phase",
    "it was found that the impurity susceptibility behaves in a curie - like fashion : @xmath233 as @xmath234 , while the local susceptibility has multiplicative logarithmic corrections , so that : @xmath235 .",
    "this result , which holds in any order of @xmath175 expansion , agrees with  @xcite , however it contradicts later nrg investigations  @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the logarithmic corrections are beyond the accuracy of the large @xmath78 expansion in the particle - hole symmetric case . on the other hand ,",
    "the resulting phase diagram at finite temperature is qualitatively similar to that , obtained by nrg  @xcite and dynamic multichannel  @xcite methods .",
    "moreover the contours of constant @xmath98 change very slowly ( logarithmically ) with @xmath98 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . therefore",
    ", we expect that the conclusions about the kondo phase are reliable .",
    "also we examined the situations with @xmath236 and @xmath35 .",
    "the former appears to be analogous to the case @xmath36 with the only difference that exponential ( logarithmical ) behavior is substituted by the suitable power law . for @xmath35",
    "the picture is different in a sense that the phase diagram is qualitatively consistent with nrg results even in the zero temperature limit .",
    "finally we studied the behavior of a non - magnetic impurity in a d - wave superconductor , which creates a staggered magnetization on the nearest copper neighbors .",
    "it was found that the saddle point corresponding to the true minimum of the action always has a @xmath48-symmetry .",
    "the resulting spatial structure of the quasiparticle density of states near the impurity for this saddle point is consistent with experimental data .",
    "it was also shown that unlike the single spin case the critical magnetic coupling corresponding to the kondo transition decreases as @xmath15 increases .",
