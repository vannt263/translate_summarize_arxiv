    "the recent detections of gravitational radiation events gw150914  @xcite and gw151226  @xcite from black hole binary inspiral has underscored the importance of understanding the theoretical predictions of the waveforms for such processes .",
    "numerical relativity , the computation of the einstein s nonlinear equations  @xcite , has played an important role in generating these predictions , but there is a wide range of binary parameters , and studying an appropriately large and finely spaced set of waveforms requires a more efficient methodology to supplement numerical relativity .",
    "one such methodology is the effective - one - body approximation ( eob )  @xcite , used together with the linear equations of the extreme mass ratio particle - perturbation technique  @xcite and numerical relativity  @xcite .    in the eob model , two different techniques",
    "are used to generate a full waveform signal from a black hole binary system and the results are amplitude and phase matched . in the early epoch ( inspiral - plunge ) of the binary s evolution , an eob hamiltonian system is evolved and the waveform is computed using a inspiral - plunge trajectory . for the late ( merger - ringdown )",
    "epoch , the early epoch waveform is matched to a linear superposition of several quasi - normal modes .",
    "the precise moment in the binary s evolution at which this matching is performed is thus a very critical matter in the eob approach . in the original eob work",
    "@xcite it was argued that this matching should be performed close to the light ring where the orbital frequency peaks ; thus , the peak of the waveform amplitude was identified with the light ring as well .    the fact that these two peaks do not actually align has been a complication in this program .",
    "particularly troublesome has been the dependence of the peak offsets on the orbital frequency , and the fact that different ( spin - weighted ) spherical harmonic modes have significantly different offsets  @xcite . in the eob papers a time delay is defined , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the time at which the peak of the @xmath2 mode of radiation is observed , and @xmath3 is the time at which radiation would be observed from the maximum of the particle s angular velocity . in most cases ( i.e. results from numerical relativity and particle perturbation theory models ) ,",
    "this delay is negative ; the peak radiation is earlier than the radiation from the peak of angular velocity .",
    "such studies have raised the question why there should be a peak offset , that is , why the apparent peak of the supposed source of radiation does not align with the peak of the radiation generated . not only would an answer satisfy scientific curiosity , but it could lead to an effective way of predicting the peak offsets .",
    "it has been suggested  @xcite that the offset , and its dependence on angular frequency , might be explained as manifestations of the energy dependence of the scattering of gravitational radiation off the curvature potential  @xcite created by the black holes .    in this paper",
    "we will answer that question by exploiting an approach we have recently developed  @xcite . in that approach ,",
    "we use the fourier domain green function ( fdgf ) for a very simple model in which we replace the curvature potential with a simplified truncated dipole potential ( tdp )  @xcite . in our approach , we use point particle trajectories , but we do not require them to be analogs of geodesics . this greater freedom to vary trajectories , combined with the simplification from the tdp model , gives transparency to the problem of the location of the radiation peak , and its dependence on angular velocity .",
    "the clear picture that is revealed is that the outgoing radiation consists of two components .",
    "one component , the quasinormal or scattered radiation , is due to the motion through the strong field spacetime ( equivalently , motion in the neighborhood of the peak of the curvature potential ) .",
    "the second component is the `` direct radiation , '' radiation that has little to do with the curved spacetime , and can be fully ascribed to the motion of the particle as if it were in flat spacetime .",
    "the peak radiation is a result of the combination of the two components .    through the use of numerical evolution codes we have investigated whether this picture applies to the extreme mass - ratio inspiral ( emri ) problem in the schwarzschild geometry .",
    "although the direct and scattered contributions can not be separated in an evolution code , the character of the results clearly indicates that this picture does apply .",
    "further study is appropriate to the applicability to the inspiral of comparable mass holes , but the indications are strong that here too it applies .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : tdp ] we review the features of the tdp / fdgf model that are most relevant to the investigation of the peak location .",
    "numerical results from that model are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : tdpresults ] , and a tentative explanation is presented of the location of the amplitude peak .",
    "section  [ sec : schw ] then shows that the qualitative features of the peak location are the same for the emri models in the schwarzschild spacetime as in the tdp model .",

    "we have found that the early retarded time peak of the outgoing radiation , the peak of interest as an analog of the schwarzschild problem , is generated by the motion of the particle before it passes inward past the edge . in this case , the radiative part of the solution ( i.e. , the part to leading order in @xmath51 ) has the form @xmath52f(t)\\,dt\\,.\\ ] ] note that this solution is good only for retarded time @xmath53 less than or equal to the critical value @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the time at which the particle reaches @xmath21 .    in the solution given by eq .",

    "we have checked other `` radial '' motions , including trajectories with much smaller values of @xmath80 , to be sure that the observations in this paper apply rather generally .",
    "there are two important considerations in the choice of the parameters for the angular motion in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phioft ] ) .",
    "first , for the schwarzschild emri case , the maximum of the angular velocity is at the @xmath22 light ring .",
    "the tdp analog of the light ring is the potential edge at @xmath21 .",
    "the problem is that this is also where the maximum radiation would be expected due to features of the problem that have nothing to do with angular motion .",
    "( this expectation will be confirmed by results below . )",
    "thus , if we use the most physical choice for @xmath81 , the choice @xmath82 , it will be impossible to disentangle the effect of angular motion from other elements of the generation of radiation .",
    "for that reason we choose @xmath83 , and make three choices of the value of the shift parameter .",
    "the second important consideration is the scale for @xmath84 .",
    "intuitively we ( correctly ) suspect that too small a value of @xmath84 will mean that the angular motion will be irrelevant ; the properties of the radiation will differ very little from radial infall .",
    "we suggest that angular motion will become significant when @xmath84 is of the order of the quasinormal frequency @xmath85 .",
    "a justifiable basis for such intuition is that the only length scale in the model is @xmath21 , so the only scale for frequency is @xmath86 .",
    "full clarification will come later in this section .     for the standard model of `` radial '' infall with @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "the curve marked `` low @xmath87 '' represents all models with @xmath88 .",
    "the numerical markings on the higher curves indicate the value of @xmath84 and the shift , respectively .",
    "the short vertical bars indicate the retarded time at which a signal would be received from the particle when moves at @xmath84 .",
    "the bars are marked with the value of the applicable shift.[extremes ] ]    we first dispense with the high and low cases in fig .  [ extremes ] .",
    "for @xmath88 , all curves , for any of the shifts , are indistinguishable , and are represented in fig .",
    "[ extremes ] by the single curve denoted  low @xmath87 .",
    "this simply confirms the understanding that for such values the angular motion is irrelevant to the generation of the peak radiation .",
    "the peak of the amplitude of this curve is at @xmath89 , reasonably close to the retarded time @xmath90 corresponding to the particle crossing the potential edge .",
    "this is also the time when the particle achieves its maximum angular velocity , for the choice shift=0 .",
    "the choices shift=@xmath91 , however , correspond to very different retarded times , as indicated by the vertical bars in the figure .",
    "the fact that the low @xmath87 curves are not influenced by a change in the shift choice , emphasizes that these results show no effects of angular motion .    the higher curves in fig .",
    "[ extremes ] show the radiation for @xmath92 , and for shifts 0,@xmath91 ( given as the second index in each curve s label )",
    ". these curves do not all have a well defined peak , but a few points remain quite clear : ( i )  the location of the region of peak amplitude is significantly earlier than the time that peak radiation would be expected ( the vertical bars in the figure ) if the maximum amplitude were related to the maximum angular velocity .",
    "( ii )  the displacement of the amplitude peaks has no strong correlation with the shifts in the peak angular velocity .",
    "( iii )  the curves show an oscillatory behavior throughout that can be shown to have periodicity that is accurately correlated with the particle angular motion at the corresponding retarded time , after a correction for the doppler shift  @xcite .",
    "( iv )  the fact that there are oscillations shows that the radiation can not be due only to the angular motion .",

    "note that the qn frequency s value is @xmath95 for this model .",
    "[ intermediate ] ]    by exploiting the simplicity of the tdp / fdgf mathematics we can analyze the source of this behavior .",
    "figure  [ scatvsdirect ] shows the radiation amplitudes separately for the direct and the scattered components of the total , i.e. , for the amplitudes computed separately from the first and second integrals in eq .",

    "the total amplitude , in fact , is very nearly the sum of the two individual amplitudes . on the other hand , for low values @xmath84 , the two components of radiation appear to be totally out of phase .",
    "what is most important to an explanation about the results in is that in fig .",
    "[ scatvsdirect ] , the direct contribution fall off at late retarded times , times approaching @xmath96 , the retarded time corresponding to the particle crossing the @xmath21 edge .",

    "the decrease in the direct radiation is , in fact , because the reflected outgoing radiation from the particle tends to cancel the radiation going directly outward from the particle .",
    "as the partice approaches the reflecting edge at @xmath21 , this cancelation tends to be complete .",
    "there is a general , but not universal tendency for the scattered radiation , like the direct radiation , also to fall off as @xmath99 .",
    "what is central , however , to the explanation of the early amplitude peak is that the direct radiation , an important part of the total radiation , must vanish at @xmath100 , thereby forcing the peak amplitude to occur earlier .",
    "this explanation can be reinforced by a consideration of the relative phases of the two radiation components . at the start of motion ( @xmath101 in fig .",
    "[ scatvsdirect ] ) there can be no radiation ; the particle is starting with no radial or angular acceleration .",

    "[ scatvsdirect ] therefore start with the two components out of phase , but the subsequent development is quite different for low and for high @xmath84 . for low @xmath84 , the two components remain out of phase .",
    "the fact that for low @xmath84 the amplitude peak occurs at `` late '' times , not much before @xmath102 , can be ascribed to the vanishing of the subtraction of the out of phase direct radiation .",

    "the physically required decrease in the direct component as @xmath103 approaches @xmath96 along with the observed tendency for the scattered component also to decrease explains why the amplitude peak at high @xmath84 is at early times .",
    "it now remains to be seen whether this explanation applies to the schwarzschild problem as well as to our tdp toy model .",
    "as pointed out in sec .

    "it is important to fix the value of @xmath131 for a proper comparison with our current work , in order for the potential function to stay unchanged .    in the kerr context , table iii in ref .",
    "@xcite depicts the peak offset of the @xmath134 mode as function of the kerr parameter @xmath130 .",
    "it is clear from that data that as @xmath130 increases the gravitational waveform peaks earlier .",
    "once again , this is consistent with the expectations from the previous sections in this work , because a higher value of @xmath130 implies higher orbital frequency ( a smaller isco allows the particle to orbit a lot closer to the kerr hole ) and those cases peak at earlier times .",
    "of course , it should be pointed out that the kerr potential is strongly spin - dependent , and that likely plays a role in the timing of the peaks as well .",
    "moreover for the high - spin cases , while the peak offset is large , it is also true that the peak `` flattens out '' considerably , making it harder to pinpoint its precise location .    as examples of these offsets",
    "we present results adapted from refs .",
    "these results were generated using a high - accuracy and high - performance teukolsky equation solver in the time - domain , with a point - particle source term  @xcite .",
    "table  [ kerrtable ] shows the delay in the dominant @xmath135 mode of gravitational radiation for a particle spiralling in on an equatorial orbit into a kerr black hole .",
    "the value of @xmath130 indicates the spin of the kerr hole , and in the first row , a negative @xmath130 indicating retrograde inspiral .",
    "the second column shows the delay , in units of the black hole mass @xmath9 , of the time by which peak radiation is delayed after the time that radiation arrives from the peak of the angular velocity . for all but",
    "the retrograde inspiral , this delay is negative ; the peak of the amplitude is earlier than the signal coming from the peak of angular velocity .",
    "this table also shows a comparison of frequencies that will be relevant to our explanation of this delay .",
    "the third column shows the peak of the angular velocity @xmath136 .",
    "the angular velocity is given in units of @xmath126 and multiplied by 2 since the 2,2 radiation produced by angular motion should have frequency twice that of the angular motion .",
    "the third column , with the quasinormal frequencies for the least damped 2,2 mode shows that this frequency is close to the angular velocity and thus the mechanism for the peak offset is likely to be the same that we have presented in this current work .",
    "though peak time offsets have been important in waveform construction , all that has been known is that such a time offset exists and that it is different ( a ) in the schwarzschild background for gravitational waves in different multipole modes , and also ( b ) in the kerr background for even a given multipole mode , but different values of @xmath130 .",
    "we know of no claim in the literature that suggests an explanation of this offset , what it depends on , or whether ( a ) and ( b ) are related .",
    "in this paper we present insights that provide at least the beginning of an explanation of the peak offset phenomenon .",
    "these insights are the results of exploiting the simplicity of a model first explored in our previous paper  @xcite .",
    "in particular , ( i )  the curvature potential of the schwarzschild emri problem is replaced by a simplified truncated dipole potential ; ( ii )  the source is understood through the fourier domain green function ; ( iii )  we do not restrict ourselves to geodesic orbits , but use trajectories that allow us to probe the mechanisms for the generation of radiation .",
    "this simplicity has produced a very simple explanation of why the amplitude peak for low @xmath84 is at the `` expected '' late retarded time , but for high @xmath84 is significantly earlier . in simplest terms the idea is that the radiation consists of two components , direct radiation and scattered radiation , and that the direct component vanishes at the `` expected '' retarded time . for low @xmath84 the two components are out of phase , so the late - time vanishing of the subtracted direct radiation means that the peak , dominated by the scattered radiation , can occur at late times . for high @xmath84",
    "the two components are in phase .",
    "the vanishing of the late - time direct radiation , therefore , removes its addition to the total , and pushes the peak total to earlier times .",
    "the separation of the direct and scattered components of the radiation for the schwarzschild emri problem is not simple , but the qualitative similarity of our results for the tdp and the schwarzschild background , both for gravitational waves and for scalar waves ( not reported here ) , makes a strong case that the same mechanism is at work .",
    "the case is particularly strong for the claim that the replacement of the schwarzschild curvature potential by the tdp potential is justified in seeking an explanation .",
    "further support comes from the details of the schwarzschild results in the literature . in table ii of the emri studies reported for the schwarzschild background in ref .",
    "@xcite , the time by which the amplitude peak precedes the angular velocity peak , for a given @xmath131 mode , increases with the @xmath133 index of the mode .",
    "this increase is mathematically equivalent to increasing the angular velocity .",
    "the reported results , then , show that as the angular velocity increases , the peak moves earlier , as in the results we report above , both for the tdp and schwarzschild models .    turning to the kerr case , in table [ kerrtable ] we present results    .the time offsets of the @xmath120 peak of radiation from particles spiralling into kerr black holes with spin parameter @xmath137 , and mass @xmath9 .",
    "the second column shows the offset , in units of @xmath9 , of the peak gw amplitude , the time by which the gw peak follows the signal from the maximum of the angular velocity .",
    "the third column shows twice the peak orbital frequency , in units of @xmath126 of the inspiralling particle .",
    "the fourth column is the quasinormal frequency of the dominant ( least damped ) @xmath120 mode .",
    "it is clear that when the last two columns have values that are comparable , a significant offset is observed .",
    "[ kerrtable ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     of emri studies adapted from refs .",
    "@xcite . of note",
    "is the fact that the peak frequency that is at a value quite close to that of the real part of the least damped quasinormal frequency for the gw 2,2 mode .",
    "these frequencies correspond to the high / intermediate frequencies of secs .",
    "[ sec : tdpresults ] and [ sec : schw ] and thus is highly suggestive that the same mechanism may be at play in the kerr case as well .",
    "it remains to be seen whether the strong @xmath130 dependence of the offsets in the kerr geometry can be fully explained in terms of the same mechanism as in the tdp and schwarzschild cases .",
    "the insights about these peak offsets , as presented in this paper , can most effectively be used in the eob approach to waveform construction .",
