    "at energies beyond the @xmath1 channel resonance region the vector meson photoproduction off the nucleon is traditionally discussed in terms of exchanges in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 channels .    at",
    "forward angles the vector meson photoproduction is dominated by the exchanges in the @xmath5 channel .",
    "a long time ago , berman and drell  @xcite proposed that at low energies and small @xmath5 meson photoproduction can be well understood in terms of the exchanges of light mesons .",
    "most recently , donnachie and landshoff  @xcite and laget  @xcite illustrated that at high energies the photoproduction can be well described by soft pomeron and meson regge trajectories .",
    "furthermore , the high energy data  @xcite on @xmath7 photoproduction at @xmath8 above @xmath90.4  gev@xmath10 require some additional contribution , which might stem from the hard pomeron exchange  @xcite .",
    "the data  @xcite on @xmath11 meson photoproduction can be reproduced well by an additional introduction of the hard pomeron exchange in the @xmath5 channel  @xcite even at small @xmath8 .    at backward angles , i.e. where @xmath8 becomes large and @xmath3 still remains small ,",
    "the photoproduction is dominated by exchanges in the @xmath6 channel . at low energies beyond the resonance region ,",
    "the production amplitude is given by the nucleon exchange . at high energies",
    "it is due to the contribution from the nucleon regge trajectory .",
    "meson photoproduction at the kinematical region where both @xmath5 and @xmath6 are large can be dominated by hard interactions between the photon and the quarks of the nucleon .",
    "it is believed that this region is beyond the applicability of the standard boson exchange and regge models .",
    "moreover , a typical signature  @xcite of hard processes is a strong @xmath12 dependence of the differential photoproduction cross section .",
    "experimental results  @xcite on backward @xmath0 meson photoproduction at photon energies @xmath13 between 2.8 and 4.8  gev collected at daresbury laboratory indicate a prominent structure shown in fig .",
    "[ gaomk2 ] .",
    "the differential @xmath14 cross section has a dip around @xmath15  gev@xmath10 , which becomes more pronounced with increasing the photon energy .",
    "it was proposed  @xcite to parameterize the @xmath16 differential cross section as a sum of contributions from the regge trajectory exchange and hard mechanism .",
    "indeed the energy dependence of the @xmath0 meson photoproduction cross section @xmath14 at different values of @xmath6 was fitted well by @xmath17 with fixed power @xmath18 and parameters @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 adjusted to the data  @xcite .",
    "it was found that @xmath22 corresponds to the nucleon trajectory , that the parameter @xmath20 does not depend on @xmath6 and the phase @xmath23 indicating that the regge exchange and hard mechanism do not interfere .    finally , the data  @xcite on backward @xmath0 photoproduction off a nucleon at @xmath13 between 2.8 and 4.8  gev were interpreted as due to the dominant contribution from the nucleon regge trajectory exchange at @xmath240.2  gev@xmath10 and an additional contribution from the hard interaction between the photon and the quarks of the target nucleon .    on the other hand , the data  @xcite on backward @xmath7 and @xmath25 meson photoproduction collected at the same spectrometer and for",
    "the same range of photon energies do not indicate a dip around @xmath26  gev@xmath10 as well as a strong @xmath27 dependence .",
    "furthermore high precision measurements  @xcite at slac of the backward photoproduction of charged pions off a nucleon at photon energies between 4.1 and 14.8  gev and @xmath28  gev@xmath10 also do not indicate a dip at @xmath290.15  gev@xmath10 .",
    "slac data  @xcite on backward @xmath30 photoproduction at photon energies @xmath13=6 , 8 , 12 and 18  gev show a @xmath31 dependence with no sign of a dip at @xmath6 between -1 and 0  gev@xmath10 .",
    "therefore , among available data on meson photoproduction at large angles only the @xmath16 reaction shows a very specific signature which might be interpreted as an indication of hard interactions between the photon and the nucleon .",
    "however it is quite difficult to motivate that the @xmath0 photoproduction can be sensitive to hard processes whereas photoproduction of @xmath32 , @xmath7 and @xmath25 mesons are not , since hard interactions are driven by the partonic structure of the hadrons .",
    "here we investigate whether the data  @xcite on backward @xmath0 meson photoproduction might be understood in terms of a standard hadronic approach as a meson exchange model . at photon energies above the @xmath1 resonance region",
    "we adopt the @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 exchanges in the @xmath5 channel as well as the nucleon exchange in the @xmath1 and @xmath6 channels . within meson exchange models ,",
    "the contribution from the nucleon exchange dominates at large angles .",
    "it is important to note that within the meson exchange model , the difference between the data on backward @xmath0 and @xmath32 , @xmath7 and @xmath25 meson photoproduction can be reasonably motivated , since the couplings and the form factor functions in the meson - nucleon - nucleon vertices are not necessarily identical for the various mesons .",
    "moreover , theoretical analysis  @xcite of the nucleon - nucleon interaction really result in different vertex functions for different mesons .",
    "the vector meson photoproduction at small four momentum @xmath5 transfer has been studied theoretically for a long time  @xcite .",
    "considering the contributions from all possible intermediate states that are lighter than the produced vector mesons , joos and kramer  @xcite formulated the @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 exchange model .",
    "the coupling constants for the @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 exchanges were fixed either from the analysis of nucleon - nucleon scattering or from the relevant partial decay widths of the vector meson to the photon and the pseudoscalar meson .",
    "the @xmath35 coupling was not specified explicitly .",
    "form factors in the interaction vertices were not taken into account  @xcite .    however , the model in its original formulation  @xcite was not able to reproduce the data on @xmath0 photoproduction at energies 1.8@xmath365.8  gev collected later  @xcite .",
