    "trans - neptunian objects ( tnos ) are believed to be ice - rich bodies formed in regions distant from the sun .",
    "several kinds of icy species have been detected from tnos by previous visible and near - infrared spectroscopic observations .",
    "h@xmath0o ice , known as the most abundant volatile material in the solar system , is generally the primary component on icy surfaces of tnos except for the largest objects such as pluto , eris , sedna , and makemake , that are covered by ch@xmath4 ice .",
    "ice is condensed from the vapor in nebula gas as amorphous phase in a cold environment far bellow 100  k , @xcite .",
    "transition from amorphous to crystalline ice requires @xmath21  hr at 130  k , while @xmath210@xmath5  yr at 90  k @xcite .",
    "pristine h@xmath0o ice maintains an amorphous state from the beginning of the solar system if the temperature remains lower than @xmath280  k. although the typical surface temperature of tnos is @xmath24060  k @xcite , the spectra of large tnos obviously exhibit the absorption feature of crystalline h@xmath0o ice at 1.65  @xmath1 , e.g. , charon @xcite , quaoar , haumea , and orcus .",
    "satellite hiiaka and collisional family members @xcite are also known to be covered by crystalline h@xmath0o ice .",
    "additionally , several moderate - size tnos / centaurs have been suggested to have surfaces covered in crystalline h@xmath0o ice ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these objects are highly likely to have experienced a certain process resulting in the production and/or provision of crystalline h@xmath0o ice on their surfaces .",
    "several mechanisms have been suggested , including radiogenic heating , cryovolcanism @xcite , and micrometeorite impact annealing @xcite .",
    "however , it remains unknown which of them primarily causes the presence of crystalline h@xmath0o ice on the surfaces .",
    "elucidation of the generation process could provide an insight into the formation , evolution , and possibly interior structure of icy small bodies in the outer solar system .",
    "for this purpose , it is essential to clarify the following ambiguous questions ; ( i ) is the presence of crystalline h@xmath0o ice on the surfaces ubiquitous among tnos ?",
    "if yes , is the crystallinity constant among them ? ( ii ) does the presence / abundance of crystalline ice depend on the body size and/or other parameters ?",
    "in the former case , what is the size limit for the surface containing crystalline ice ?    in the present circumstances , however , the general knowledge regarding abundance distribution of surface crystallinity in the tno population is still poor because of a lack of observational constraints .",
    "most of the known tnos are too faint to obtain spectra with sufficient quality to accurately determine the ratio of crystalline and amorphous phases on their surfaces even by largest - class telescopes .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a new measurement technique for h@xmath0o ice crystallinity on icy small bodies with near - infrared photometric data acquired by the subaru telescope .",
    "we use the narrow - band filter called  nb1657 \" , allowing us to evaluate the strength of 1.65-@xmath1 absorption of crystalline h@xmath0o with high precision .",
    "the results demonstrate that this method is useful for an effective survey of the crystalline ice abundance from a large number of tnos .",
    "our observation was carried out on april 7 , 2013 , with multi - object infrared camera and spectrograph ( moircs ; * ? ? ?",

    "we performed a near - infrared imaging using the @xmath9 band and narrow band filter nb1657 .",
    "the nb1657 with the center wavelength of 1.657  @xmath1 and band width of 0.019  @xmath1 @xcite is suitable for diagnosing the absorption of crystalline h@xmath0o ice at 1.65  @xmath1 ( see figure  [ fig01 ] ) .",
    "the sky condition was photometric , with a seeing size of mostly 0608 .",
    "our target objects consist of seven tnos listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "these objects have been reported to contain h@xmath0o ice on the surfaces in the near - infrared spectroscopy by @xcite , i.e. , @xmath10  @xmath11  0.1 , where @xmath10 represents the spectral fraction of h@xmath0o ice .",
    "the observational circumstances are shown in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "every image was taken with an exposure of 4280  sec in the @xmath9 band and 90180  sec in the nb1657 under sidereal tracking .",
    "the sky motion within the exposure time is sufficiently smaller than the seeing size to treat the target objects as a point source .",
    "the nb1657 data was obtained between just before / after @xmath9-band imagings to reduce color uncertainty caused by rotational brightness variation .",
    "data reduction was conducted using iraf produced by the national optical astronomy observatories ( noao ) and mcsred @xcite with standard processes : linearity correction , flat - fielding , sky subtraction , and distortion correction .",
    "images with each band were shifted according to the sky motion of a target object and were combined .",
    "position - matched composite images were also created for determining the point spread function ( psf ) from the field stars .",
    "we adopted aperture photometry for flux measurement using the iraf / apphot package . to increase signal - to - noise ratio ,",
    "the aperture correction technique has been applied .",
    "summed pixel counts within a small aperture with radius of @xmath2@xmath12@xmath13  arcsec were converted into total flux based on the flux ratio computed from the psf profile given by the field stars .",

    "the models well reproduce the observed spectra inclusive of the 1.65-@xmath1 feature in both objects .",
    "it supports that our photometric method is useful to constrain the phase ratio of crystalline to amorphous for an icy small body of which @xmath10 is known .",
    "the effect of the assumed ice properties , temperature and grain size , for determination of the crystallinity factor is examined in the following section .",
    "the depth and center wavelength of the 1.65-@xmath1 band sensitively vary with temperature and grain size , while the two parameters were given as thermal temperature estimated from equation  ( [ eq4 ] ) and @xmath33  =  50  @xmath1 , respectively , in the above modeling .",
    "@xcite presented disk - averaged h@xmath0o ice temperatures of jovian , saturnian , and uranian satellites derived from their near - infrared spectra . they pointed out that the ice temperature is generally lower than the brightness temperature derived from thermal emission which is sensitive to warm regions on the surface with the typical difference of @xmath210  k. the target objects could actually have a lower surface temperature .",
    "we conducted additional modeling with the same processes presented in section  [ sec : subsec3 - 1 ] but using the optical constant data of crystalline h@xmath0o ice at temperatures 10  k lower than those in table  [ tab4 ] .",
    "the results , shown in table  [ tab6 ] , indicate no significant change in the obtained crystallinity factor compared with the original spectrum model in any objects .",
    "such a difference in the given temperature causes a systematic error of no more than @xmath210% for our crystallinity measurements .    on the other hand ,",
    "grain size can induce considerable uncertainty in the modeling .",
    "although the dominant size of the ice grains on surface layer of tnos is still unknown , @xcite reported surface composition models of 12 tnos / centaurs based on their near - infrared spectroscopy data showing that most of their surfaces contain h@xmath0o ice ( in crystalline and/or amorphous states ) with the particle diameter of @xmath210200  @xmath1 .",
    "many of the previous studies of tno / centaur spectra showed the best - matched grain sizes in this range .",
    "note that h@xmath0o ice with larger ice grains enhance the absorption coefficients , but the enhancement saturates at the diameter of @xmath21000  @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast , if the grains are smaller than @xmath210  @xmath1 , the absorptions are too weak to measure the 1.65-@xmath1 feature via @xmath16(@xmath9@xmath14nb1657 ) index .",
    "thus , our technique is applicable to objects whose surfaces are dominated by h@xmath0o ice with the grain size of @xmath2101000  @xmath1 .",
    "we examined the variation of crystallinity factor for our observed objects among the spectral models with grain sizes from 10  @xmath1 to 200  @xmath1 in diameter ( see figure  [ fig05 ] ) .",
    "a uniform size between the crystalline and amorphous particles was assumed in each pattern .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig06 ] .",
    "one can see that the crystallinity factor monotonically decreases with increasing grain size .",
    "this is because of the optical characteristic of h@xmath0o ice that larger grains increase the amount of 1.65-@xmath1 absorption rather than that of entire absorption covered by the @xmath9 band , as pointed out in @xcite . although the crystallinity factor varies greatly between the smallest and largest grain sizes , it remains larger than @xmath20.5 within the error in haumea , quaoar , typhon , and 2008  ap@xmath3 .",
    "orcus has a slightly lower crystallinity in case of the largest grain sizes , but definitely contains a certain level of crystalline ice .",
    "this result indicates that all of the five objects whose crystallinity has been precisely determined are likely to be covered by a surface containing crystalline - dominant h@xmath0o ice or comparable to it .",
    "the spectrum model given by equation  ( [ eq2 ] ) approximates the surface reflectance spectrum of the target objects as a combination of h@xmath0o ice and other materials of which the total spectrum shows a linear - sloped continuum with no absorption feature . for the @xmath9-band data",
    ", this assumption seems to be reasonable because most non - h@xmath0o ices which are potentially contained on the tnos surface , e.g. , ch@xmath42oh , co , co@xmath0 , n@xmath0 , and nh@xmath42 , have no or only slight absorptions over the wavelength range @xcite .",
    "however , ch@xmath4 ice could be influential for determination of h@xmath0o ice crystallinity because it exhibits several absorption features from 1.5  @xmath1 to 1.8  @xmath1 @xcite . in particular",
    ", the strong absorption bands at 1.67  @xmath1 possibly makes a significant negative contribution to the @xmath16(@xmath9@xmath14nb1657 ) index .",
    "various near - infrared spectroscopies suggest the presence of ch@xmath4 ice on several tnos with h@xmath0o ice - rich surface including quaoar and orcus . according to previous studies of the two spectra ,",
    "the average fraction of ch@xmath4 ice is @xmath20.05 , corresponding to ch@xmath4/h@xmath0o  @xmath2  0.15 . to evaluate the effect of ch@xmath4 ice mixing on measurements of h@xmath0o ice crystallinity , we calculated the @xmath16(@xmath9@xmath14nb1657 ) index with several patterns of the particle number ratio ( ch@xmath4/h@xmath0o  =  0.050.20 ) and ch@xmath4 ice grain size ( @xmath33  = 10 , 50 , and 100  @xmath1 ) .",
    "the optical constants of ch@xmath4 ice used for the spectrum modeling are as follows : ( i ) the real part of refractive index @xmath43 is given by @xmath44 ( 0.67  @xmath1  @xmath45  @xmath19  @xmath45  2.0  @xmath1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ( ii ) the imaginary part of refractive index @xmath46 is converted from the absorption coefficients of phase  i ch@xmath4 ice ( stable between 20  k and 90  k ) presented by @xcite .",
    "the synthetic model spectra were generated from equation  ( [ eq2 ] ) by replacing the reflectance spectrum of h@xmath0o ice , @xmath47 , with that of mixed ices of h@xmath0o and ch@xmath4 derived from the intimate mixture model developed by @xcite .",
    "the grain size of h@xmath0o ice was fixed to @xmath33  =  50  @xmath1 .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig07 ] .",
    "if ch@xmath4 ice grain is equal to or smaller than h@xmath0o ice grain , the h@xmath0o ice crystallinity factors are larger than 0.50 and 0.25 for quaoar and orcus , respectively .",
    "the situation is similar if ch@xmath4/h@xmath0o  @xmath48  0.05 .",
    "in contrast , the absorption due to the larger - grain ch@xmath4 ice on the surface with ch@xmath4/h@xmath0o  @xmath11  0.1 dominates at @xmath21.65  @xmath1 and could cause a great uncertainty of h@xmath0o ice crystallinity .    we recognize that and provide the most reliable spectral modeling for quaoar and orcus , respectively , among the published works .",
    "the former suggests quaoar s surface containing fine ch@xmath4 ice grains of @xmath33  @xmath2  10  @xmath1 with a slightly high fraction of ch@xmath4/h@xmath0o  @xmath2  0.3 .",
    "the latter suggests orcus s surface containing coarse ch@xmath4 ice grains of @xmath33  @xmath2  100  @xmath1 with a tiny fraction of ch@xmath4/h@xmath0o  @xmath49  0.03 .",
    "if those parameters are simply applied to our modeling , they indicate that the potential presence of ch@xmath4 ice is unlikely to induce significant overestimation of h@xmath0o ice crystallinity against quaoar and orcus .",
    "provided that the observed objects are coated by h@xmath0o ice grain of @xmath33  @xmath48  50  @xmath1 with negligible contamination by other ices such as ch@xmath4 , our results suggest the following implications :    \\(i ) not only haumea and quaoar known as large objects rich in crystalline h@xmath0o ice , but also smaller objects , typhon and 2008  ap@xmath3 , contain crystalline - dominated h@xmath0o ice on the surfaces .",
    "\\(ii ) orcus has a crystallinity of comparable to 0.5 , obviously lower than haumea and quaoar .",
    "\\(iii ) no objects with low - crystallinity surface have been found in our well - measured tno sample .",
    "the initial state of h@xmath0o ice in tnos is likely to be amorphous if the bodies formed beyond @xmath225  au from the sun @xcite . such pristine ice could be heated and crystallized through thermal evolution after the formation .",
    "based on the timescale to onset of crystallization @xcite and the timescale to completion of crystallization , amorphous ice at @xmath50  70  k would be crystallized within the solar system age @xcite .",
    "additionally , surface annealing due to micrometeorite impacts may also be effective in inducing ice crystallization . in this section",
    ", we discuss several possible mechanisms for crystallization of the surface h@xmath0o ice of tnos .",
    "note that crystalline h@xmath0o ice can be amorphized by irradiation of uv photon as well as energetic particles such as protons and electrons from the solar wind and cosmic rays .",
    "and @xcite confirmed that uv photolysis induces the amorphization at 16 and 90  k , respectively , through irradiation experiments .",
    "however , as @xcite pointed out , the uv penetration depth is much less than the optical depth in near - infrared ( @xmath2350  @xmath1 ) .",
    "the effect of uv photolysis can be excluded in this observation . on the other hand , protons above @xmath21  mev and electrons above @xmath20.1  mev have stopping ranges larger than the optical depth for h@xmath0o ice target @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented the results of proton irradiation experiments , indicating ( i ) amorphous ice was produced at low temperatures ( @xmath49  40  k ) , ( ii ) some crystalline ice persisted at 50  k after irradiation , and ( iii ) the crystalline spectrum showed only slight changes at @xmath51  70  k.    @xcite investigated the effect of electron irradiation on the near - infrared spectra and found that crystalline h@xmath0o ice can be converted only partially to amorphous at 40  k or higher . according to measurements from the geostationary operational environmental satellites ( goes ) , the fluence ratio of electrons to protons above 1  mev from solar wind is 10@xmath510@xmath52 .",
    "the interplanetary flux of proton from cosmic ray is @xmath210@xmath53 greater than that from solar wind above 1  mev at heliocentric distance of 40  au .",
    "thus , the electron is likely to be the dominant component of energetic particle irradiance on surfaces of icy bodies in the main trans - neptunian region .",
    "although there are a lot of discrepancies among previous experimental studies as mentioned in @xcite , assuming the irradiation tolerance of crystalline h@xmath0o ice based on the experimental results of @xcite , the amorphization process could be only limited .",
    "here we ignore the effect of radiation - induced amorphization in the following discussion .",
    "prior to discussions of the thermal evolution , we should confirm the variations in surface temperature of the target objects over an orbit .",
    "amorphous ice would be crystallized on surfaces that have been much warmer than 70  k over the timescale of the solar system age or less .",
    "even if there is no heat source except solar insolation , the transition from amorphous to crystalline occurs on the surface of bodies sufficiently close to the sun .",
    "all the target objects other than typhon have perihelion distances larger than 28.5  au , which are converted into surface temperature less than 66  k by equation  ( [ eq4 ] ) . assuming no experiences of significant migration from the formation , their surfaces have been cold enough for amorphous ice to be continuously stable .",
    "however , typhon has a high orbital eccentricity ( 0.54 ) allowing it to approach up to 17.5  au to the sun . around its perihelion",
    ", the sunward surface would be warmed up to @xmath286  k , while the ordinary temperature is @xmath250  k during most of the orbit . in the model of @xcite ,",
    "the time to onset of crystallization at the temperature is @xmath210@xmath54  yr . the insolation heating can induce surface crystallization if typhon keeps such an eccentric orbit over the age of the solar system and the intermittent contribution has monotonically accumulated .",
    "the decay of radioactive isotopes contained in dust mixed with ice is the most important heat source for the internal thermal evolution of small icy bodies in the outer solar system .",
    "it allows the crystallization to proceed outward from the deep interior of the body .    in @xcite , thermal evolutionary calculations of icy bodies larger than 40  km in diameter ( @xmath55 ) with heat sources of @xmath56al and four long - lived radioactive isotopes indicate that h@xmath0o ice on the outer layer seems to be left in the amorphous form .",
    "@xcite also reported that @xmath56al decay could not raise the surface temperature of tnos with @xmath55  =  201000  km higher than @xmath250  k and not induce h@xmath0o ice crystallization at the surface layers .",
    "those models can not explain surface crystallization of objects with @xmath55  @xmath50  100  km .",
    "however , assuming that the objects were formed closer to the sun than the present orbits , radiogenic heating can potentially crystallize the surface ice because of fast accretional growth , thus sufficient radiogenic heating by @xmath56al .",
    "the simulations of @xcite showed that icy bodies above @xmath55  @xmath2  30  km originally located around 20  au could be covered by a crystalline ice surface .",
    "@xcite showed that if icy bodies formed at heliocentric distance less than @xmath232  au , the crystalline / amorphous ice boundary reaches the surface .",
    "more recent work by presented three - dimensional simulations to compute the thermal evolution of icy small bodies with heat sources of several short- and long - lived radioactive isotopes .",
    "their results suggest :    * when the growth advanced quickly ( @xmath21  myr ) and short - lived isotope decay effectively contributes to the thermal evolution , objects with @xmath55  @xmath50  100  km retain only a thin ( @xmath49  2  km ) layer of amorphous h@xmath0o ice on their surface , that may possibly be removed by impact excavating .",
    "in addition , provided such objects are formed close enough to the sun ( 1015  au ) , crystallization would be triggered at the surface by insolation .",
    "* when the thermal evolution is dominated by long - lived isotope decay , only large objects ( @xmath55  @xmath50  600  km ) with a bulk density of at least 1500  kg  m@xmath57 should contain crystalline h@xmath0o ice close to the surface .",
    "our findings regarding the presence of crystalline h@xmath0o ice on typhon and 2008  ap@xmath3 agree with the first scenario .",
    "in contrast , typhon and possibly 2008  ap@xmath3 ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) are inconsistent with the second one . based on the model of ,",
    "at least those small objects should have grown in a sufficiently short time scale for the surfaces to be heated up to the crystallization temperature by the decay of short - lived isotopes unless they were formed close to the sun ( 1015  au ) .",
    "such a rapid formation as to induce a sufficient heating for surface ice crystallization due to the decay of short - lived isotopes also can occur at a smaller heliocentric distance than the current location .",
    "actually , several theoretical studies support this model . @xcite",
    "presented coagulation simulations of planetesimal growth in the outer solar system and showed the formation of objects with @xmath55  @xmath50  100  km only inside @xmath230  au .",
    "more recently , @xcite performed @xmath58-body coagulation calculations for the formation and evolution of tnos , indicating that objects at 1518  au grow up to 100  km in diameter within @xmath21  myr at earliest , while it takes more than 10  myr at 3340  au .",
    "outward transport of planetesimals from the inner regions via the planetary migration has been believed to take place based on numerical simulations for dynamical evolutions of giant planets and tnos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the rapid growth around 20  au from the sun is a plausible mechanism for crystallization of surface ice from the early radioactive heating on tnos as small as typhon .",
    "the thermal evolution model may also be able to explain the low fraction of crystalline ice on orcus compared with haumea and quaoar .",
    "one of the important parameters that the heating rate depends on is bulk density of the body .",
    "a higher density increases the abundance of dust materials containing radioactive isotopes and thus enhances heating efficiency .",
    "the difference in bulk density possibly causes the variation in crystallinity among comparable - size objects .",
    "suggest that a density of at least 1.5  g  cm@xmath57 is required for the presence of crystalline ice on the surface of objects with @xmath55  @xmath11  600  km .",
    "haumea is well known to have a high density ( @xmath2  2.6  g  cm@xmath5 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "quaoar s density also has been estimated to be high as 2.18@xmath61  g  cm@xmath57 from thermal flux or 1.99  @xmath15  0.46  g  cm@xmath57 from occultation @xcite . in contrast , orcus exhibits an obviously lower density of @xmath21.5  g  cm@xmath57 @xcite , just about the same value as the criteria for surface ice crystallization shown by .",
    "this fact suggests the possibility that orcus failed to take a sufficient rise in temperature of the upper layer for crystallizing most of the surface h@xmath0o ice due to a deficiency in the amount of radioactive isotopes . the potential correlation between crystallinity and bulk density could support the hypothesis that radiogenic heating is the dominant effect on surface crystallization for tnos",
    "a portion of surface ice may not have been formed in - situ but been supplied through the interior by geological activity of ice volcanic eruption , so - called cryovolcanism .",
    "actually , atmospheric plumes have been shown on several icy satellites of giant planets , such as triton , enceladus @xcite , and europa @xcite , as possible evidence of cryovolcanic events .",
    "the occurrence of substantial liquid h@xmath0o flow to the surface requires some sort of continual heating process to melt the subsurface ice . for the satellites ,",
    "tidal energy dissipation is likely to be a major heat source ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . even though inclusion of nh@xmath42 in h@xmath0o ice allows the melting point to drop from 273  k to 176  k at minimum @xcite and decreases the thermal conductivity , it is still uncertain whether the cryovolcanic activity can be driven on tnos primarily by long - lived radioactive isotopes without tidal heating .",
    "@xcite suggested that a body with @xmath55  @xmath50  1200  km composed of rock with a mass fraction @xmath11  0.7 ( corresponding to a bulk density @xmath11  1.8  g  cm@xmath57 ) and nh@xmath42-rich h@xmath0o ice ( @xmath20.15 by weight ) could develop cryovolcanism and be steadily resurfaced by crystalline h@xmath0o ice with a sufficient rate to be detected by near - infrared wavelength .",
    "haumea , with a mean diameter of 12001300  km and a density of 2.6  g  cm@xmath57 , satisfies those conditions .",
    "quaoar is slightly smaller than the criteria size ( @xmath210001100  km ) and has a high density ( 1.99  @xmath15  0.46  g  cm@xmath57 ; @xcite , 2.18@xmath61  g  cm@xmath57 ; ) .",
    "orcus is likely to be comparable in size to quaoar , while the density is relatively low . as pointed out by @xcite ,",
    "the ice containing ch@xmath42oh along with nh@xmath42 freezes at lower temperature and therefore is likely to reduce the minimum diameter of a tno which can retain liquid h@xmath0o to 8001000  km .",
    "cryovolcanism may be active on quaoar and orcus if they consist of ch@xmath42oh - nh@xmath42-h@xmath0o ice .",
    "unfortunately , our results can not provide explicit constraints on the source of crystalline h@xmath0o ice at the surfaces of haumea , quaoar , and orcus . on the other hand , typhon and 2008  ap@xmath3 are likely to be too small to exhibit cryovolcanic activity even if antifreeze compounds such as nh@xmath42 and ch@xmath42oh are sufficiently mixed in the subsurface ice .      instead of the internal heat sources",
    "as mentioned above , h@xmath0o ice crystallization on surfaces of airless bodies in the trans - neptunian region could be induced by impacts of meteorites such as interplanetary dust particles ( idps ) .",
    "@xcite assessed possible mechanisms with micrometeorites for explaining the presence of crystalline h@xmath0o ice on charon s surface , namely , impact gardening and annealing .",
    "they approximated the mass flux of idps from pioneer  10 observations as 2.4@xmath62  10@xmath63  kg  s@xmath64  m@xmath65 at 18  au and concluded that those mechanisms make little contribution to surface renewal on either charon or other tnos .",
    "in contrast , @xcite expected the idp flux at uranus to be 1.2@xmath62  10@xmath66  kg  s@xmath64  m@xmath65 and claimed that the impact annealing could be effective for surface crystallization on tnos .    as seen in table  2 of @xcite , the impact velocity of idps and required dust flux for annealing are similar among objects in the main trans - neptunian belt .",
    "assuming homogeneous idp distribution over the region , surface crystallinity would be almost uniform among tnos if micrometeorite impacts are the primary factor .",
    "however , considering our result indicating a low crystallinity of orcus compared with haumea and quaoar , micrometeorite annealing seems not to be a major mechanism of surface crystallization at least for icy objects as large as orcus .",
    "finally , we focus on the unique situation of 2008  ap@xmath3 that has an orbit consistent with the haumea collisional family @xcite .",
    "the relative velocity to the estimated collision s center of mass , @xmath2140  m  s@xmath64 , also agrees with the velocity dispersion of the known family members ( 50300  m  s@xmath64 ) , suggesting a dynamical association with the haumea family @xcite .",
    "the spectra of family members uniquely show significantly high fractions of h@xmath0o ice as well as the crystalline feature @xcite .",
    "however , 2008  ap@xmath3 contains only a minor fraction of h@xmath0o ice ( @xmath10 = 0.14@xmath150.09 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which prevents characterization of the membership .",
    "if 2008  ap@xmath3 originates from a collisional fragment as an ice - poor family member , the presence of crystalline h@xmath0o ice on the surface is natural because the body is likely to derive from the icy mantle of haumea .",
    "the lack of ice could be explained from inhomogeneous compositions of the partial differentiation @xcite although the actuality is still unknown .",
    "we develop a new technique for measuring the crystallinity of h@xmath0o ice on the surface of tnos with near - infrared narrow - band photometry using subaru / moircs . the strength of the 1.65-@xmath1 absorption band for five objects has been obtained and converted into the fraction of crystalline ice by comparing with the spectrum model .",
    "the largest objects , haumea , quaoar , and orcus , show a crystalline - rich icy surface as many previous spectroscopic studies have reported , while it is also found out that their surfaces are likely to contain amorphous ice unless the grain size is smaller than @xmath220  @xmath1 . for haumea and quaoar",
    ", the model spectra based on the determined fractions of crystalline ice well agree with the published near - infrared spectra , indicating reasonable accuracy of our measurements .",
    "the results indicate that h@xmath0o ice on haumea and quaoar are highly dominated by the crystalline state , while orcus shows a higher fraction of amorphous ice .",
    "based on the model of thermal evolution due to radiative decay , the low bulk density of orcus could cause suppression of the surface heating and stagnation in crystallization .",
    "it is of great significance to examine the possibility of the positive correlation between bulk density of the body , i.e. , abundance of refractory inclusion , and surface crystallinity , providing a critical clue for understanding the crystallization mechanism .",
    "we also found the presence of crystalline h@xmath0o ice on typhon and 2008  ap@xmath3 .",
    "those objects are smaller than the expected critical size ( @xmath55  @xmath2  600  km ) for surface crystallization assuming that they were formed far enough from the sun ( @xmath50  15  au ) and the initial thermal evolution was dominated by the decay of long - lived isotopes .",
    "it is still uncertain which thermal or non - thermal process is the primary crystallization mechanism for midsize tnos .",
    "further investigations are required to determine whether the body size affects the production of crystalline h@xmath0o ice at the surface layer .",
