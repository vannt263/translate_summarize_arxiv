    "entanglement , as one of the unique quantum features , is not only an important resource for quantum information processing , quantum computation , and quantum metrology , but also a subject of great theoretical interests to understand the quantum physics .",
    "it has been demonstrated in a great variety of quantum systems such as photon pairs @xcite , trapped ions @xcite , atomic ensembles @xcite and nitrogen - vacancy centers @xcite .",
    "owing to the weak interactions , the creation of entanglement between neutral atoms in the ground state has to resort to the additional enhancement approaches , such as using a high-@xmath0 cavity to mediate the interaction between transient atoms @xcite and controlling interatomic collisions by the optical lattice @xcite .",
    "recently , rapid developments of researches in rydberg excitations provide a new route to the creation of entanglement with neutral atoms .",
    "the dipolar interaction between alkali - metal atoms in highly - excited rydberg states becomes orders of magnitude stronger than the interaction between ground states , which inhibits the simultaneous excitation of two or more atoms into the same rydberg state by the so - called blockade effect , entangling two atoms in the ground state or the rydberg state @xcite .",
    "the blockade mechanism in rydberg atoms opens many new possibilities to exploit neutral atoms for the study of quantum computation and simulation @xcite .",
    "after the first proposal suggested by jaksch and coworkers to implement a fast two - qubit entangling gate @xcite , there has been a variety of theoretical and experimental works for realizing entangled state with rydberg atoms by strong blockade , where the rydberg interaction strength is large compared to the rabi frequency of driving laser @xcite .",
    "for example , combing dissipation and rydberg blockade can create various complex entangled states @xcite . especially , in a multi - level atomic system , the stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) combined with rydberg blockade is manifest as an efficient way to resist spontaneous emission in producing entangled states @xcite .",
    "the essence of stirap relies on the use of counterintuitive laser pulse sequence to transfer population by adiabatically following a dark state , which does not involve intermediate states @xcite .",
    "more recently , an alternative scheme by using double adiabatic passage across a frster resonance for the implementation of two - qubit quantum gate without blockade is also proposed @xcite .    in the current work",
    "we develop a scheme for deterministically preparing an entangled state between two atoms on different rydberg states ( i.e. @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are rydberg states ) by a frequency - chirped adiabatic passage and without the requirement of strong blockade .",
    "we consider a pair of three - level ladder - type atoms that is initially prepared in the ground state and investigate its adiabatic transfer towards the target entangled state by using proper time - dependent detuning pulses @xcite .",
    "such a level configuration with two or more rydberg states contains richer nonlinear phenomena due to its complicated interactions between different rydberg states @xcite .",
    "according to the analytical expression of adiabatic eigenstate given by the perturbations , the temporal profile of pulses can be directly obtained , for achieving a high fidelity between the real final state and the target entangled state .",
    "the influence of rydberg interactions , especially the exchange interaction between different rydberg states , on the fidelity is also investigated .",
    "our scheme can serve as a new avenue to the generation of robust and clean maximal entanglement between rydberg atoms . comparing to the common entangled states with one rydberg state and one ground state ,",
    "the obtained entangled state involving two different rydberg states has more widely applications in the quantum technology .",

    "spontaneous decays from @xmath2 ( or @xmath3 ) to @xmath7 is denoted by @xmath11 ( or @xmath12 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the system can be written as ( @xmath13 everywhere ) @xmath14 where the single atom hamiltonian is @xmath15 with the atomic operators @xmath16 for atom @xmath17 .",
    "the relevant interactions between rydberg states are classified as the van der waals ( vdws ) @xcite and the dipole - dipole ( dd ) interactions @xcite .",
    "if two atoms occupy same state @xmath2 or @xmath3 , the intrastate interactions are described by the vdws type , which are @xmath18 and if they occupy differently , the interstate exchange interaction described by the dd type is @xmath19    here , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , with @xmath23 and @xmath24 the dispersion coefficients and @xmath25 the interatomic distance .",
    "note that the exchange interaction @xmath26 is predominantly responsible for preparing entangled pair state ( exciton state ) in frster resonance @xcite .",
    "there are various approaches for generating entanglement with rydberg atoms .",
    "one typical way is using blockade effect in which the intrastate interaction is larger than the effective rabi frequency between the ground and rydberg states , giving rise to a singly - excited collective state ( entangled state ) @xmath27 of two atoms @xcite .",
    "state @xmath28 can further be extended to generate a many - atom entangled state @xmath29 with one excitation shared by @xmath30 atoms in the ensemble @xcite .",
    "another way is relying on a stirap that can transfer the population onto an entangled state of two lower states @xmath31 ( subscript @xmath32 means @xmath33 ) , by adiabatically following a dark state @xcite .",
    "this entangled state is robustly created irrespective of the precise values of couplings and interactions .",
    "more recently , rost s group proposes a scheme of creating entangled atom pairs via interstate resonant dd interactions between two different rydberg states @xcite .",
    "after preparing twin atom clouds in a blockaded condition by strong vdws interactions , they find the resonant dd interactions can give rise to a conversion from the blockaded state to a many - atom repulsive exciton state .",
    "the key for realizing this entangled exciton state is making a pair of atom clouds that only supports one collective excitation per cloud , which is the basic effect of strong blockade . as for one atom per cloud , by separately controlling the excitation of atom in each cloud",
    ", the two atoms can finally be prepared onto an entangled exciton state @xmath34 . a more general case where the entanglement is created between two distant atom clouds by using rydberg dressing",
    "is predicted in @xcite and the excitation transport of exciton is also studied in @xcite .",
    "inspired by these works , we focus on preparing a high - fidelity entangled state @xmath35 between two rydberg states @xmath2 , @xmath3 via a chirped adiabatic passage . comparing to @xmath28 and @xmath36 , the production @xmath35 containing two rydberg states is highly stable and easy to be manipulated with external fields . differing from rost s works , the time - dependence of the fields ( lasers , detunings )",
    "is intuitively obtained from the presence of an adiabatic eigenstate , which directly connects the initial ( ground ) and target ( entangled ) states with a big suppression to the population of intermediate states .",
    "also , the requirement for strong interactions is weak in our scheme .",
    "for two atoms the evolution of system preserves the symmetry under the exchange of atoms so it is sufficient to rewrite the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) in the symmetric two - atom basis @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , with @xmath39 ( = @xmath40 ) the target entangled state .",

    "our target is allowing @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and the population of intermediate states is deeply suppressed , satisfying @xmath51 . for that purpose , due to the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics ,",
    "a novel non - degenerate adiabatic eigenstate @xmath52 is required in which the system can evolve without making any transitions , when the level spacing of @xmath52 with other eigenstates is much larger compared to the changing rate of the hamiltonian @xmath53 @xcite . commonly speaking , this target",
    "could be realized by preparing a dark state , which is fully unaffected by the short lifetime of intermediate excited state , as similar as in a three - state system due to quantum interference @xcite .",
    "however , accounting for the complex energy levels and interactions , a quasi - dark adiabatic eigenstate @xmath52 is obtained instead , in which the population of intermediate states can not be perfectly suppressed .",

    "the reason for that can be qualitatively understood from the eigenenergy spectrum of @xmath167 and @xmath168 , labeled by solid curves as plotted in fig.[presult6](b1)-(b3 ) . the presence of an avoided crossing ( near - degenerate energy levels ) between the adiabatic eigenstate @xmath169 and its adjacent eigenstate @xmath170 is revealed .",

    "the location of the avoided crossing can be obtained exactly by considering @xmath180 , leading to @xmath181    at @xmath182 , the addition of two detunings ( @xmath183 ) is compensated by the exchange energy @xmath26 , leading to @xmath184 .",

    "to conclude we have proposed a novel scheme for producing high - fidelity maximal entanglement between two different rydberg states in a two - atom system based on a chirped adiabatic passage .",
    "different from typical stirap technique that requires a pair of laser pulses performing in a counterintuitive order , two slowly - varying detuning pulses ( @xmath6 and @xmath5 ) with suitable envelopes enable an adiabatic connection between the initial ground and target entangled states .",
    "for realistic parameters used in the calculations we see that the initial population prepared in the ground state can efficiently evolve into a desired entangled state within tens of microseconds .",
    "the scheme does not demand the interaction strengths to be in the strong blockade regime that is much larger than the laser rabi frequency .",
    "once the temporal profiles of the detuning pulses and the atomic interactions , especially the exchange interaction between two atoms in different rydberg states , are moderate and optimized , the entanglement which is insensitive to the precise value of intrastate interactions between same rydberg energy levels , will be robustly created .",
    "our method may provide a new route to the entanglement between two atoms on different rydberg states with high fidelity .    in comparison with other methods using dissipation for the creation of an entangled steady state with high - fidelity @xmath234 @xcite , here ,",
    "the obtained fidelity of entangled state is slightly low @xmath235 with realistic parameters @xmath11=2.0khz , @xmath12=5.0khz and @xmath107=50@xmath126s . the main loss of fidelity for the entanglement generation is caused by the spontaneous decay from population in intermediate states during the adiabatic process , which is impossible to be fully suppressed due to the reliance of a quasi - dark adiabatic eigenstate .",
    "also , as comparing to rost s works , our scheme provides a flexible way to optimize time - dependent pulses based on the adiabatic evolution of a quasi - dark eigenstate . in the future",
    ", we will further explore the ways to improve the fidelity of entanglement with more appropriate rydberg states , e.g. involving longer lifetimes or larger rabi frequencies , or by using other approaches such as shortcut to adiabaticity @xcite , adiabatic rapid passage @xcite and so on .",
