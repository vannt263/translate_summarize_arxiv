    "subdwarf b ( sdb ) stars can be identified with models for extreme horizontal branch ( ehb ) stars .",
    "the surface gravities and temperatures of sdb stars suggest that they have helium cores of mass @xmath0 and thin hydrogen envelopes of mass @xmath1 @xcite . a recent asteroseismological study of an sdb star results in a value for its mass of 0.49@xmath20.02@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "several evolutionary scenarios have been proposed to explain the formation of sdb stars , in particular the loss of the hydrogen envelope .",
    "evolution within a binary star is an effective method for envelope removal , and yet it is hard to see why this should have happened to a horizontal branch star since it would have been much larger during its preceding red giant stage .",
    "a solution to this problem was presented by dcruz et al .   who found that if a red giant star with a degenerate helium core loses its hydrogen envelope when it is within @xmath40.4magnitudes of the tip of the red giant branch , the core can go on to ignite helium , despite the dramatic mass loss , and",
    "may then appear as an sdb star .",
    "the advantage of this model is that it very nicely explains the masses of sdb stars as a consequence of the core mass at the helium flash .",
    "dcruz et al .",
    "supposed that mass loss occurred because of an enhancement of the stellar wind , but it could as well have been driven by binary interaction .    if sdb stars do form within binary systems and if they still have their companions , then the companions must be low - mass main - sequence stars or compact stellar remnants to avoid outshining the sdb star .",
    "if so , it is probable that in many cases the companions were unable to cope with the mass transferred from the sdb progenitor and a single `` common '' envelope formed around the two stars . driving off such envelopes drains energy and angular momentum from the binary orbit , which as a result becomes much smaller than it was at the start of mass transfer @xcite .",
    "it is therefore possible that many sdb stars are now members of close binary systems .",
    "maxted et al . found exactly this , discovering 21 binary sdb stars in a sample of 36 , suggesting , after allowance for detection efficiency , that some two - thirds of all sdb stars are in short period binary systems ( @xmath5 )",
    "the other third seems to be made up a combination of long period binary stars that avoided a common envelope phase @xcite and apparently single sdb stars .",
    "if dcruz et al.s model of the formation of sdb stars is correct , then the stage immediately prior to mass transfer in binary sdbs is well defined .",
    "this , together with the fact that the binary does not have enough time to change its orbital period significantly following its emergence from the common envelope , makes the sdb stars a superb population for testing models of the common envelope phase .",
    "moreover , the detection of sdb binary stars is not compromised by the strong and poorly understood selection effects that plague other populations of close binary stars , such as the cataclysmic variable stars .",
    "the properties of sdb binaries ( e.g. their orbital period distribution ) can be compared fairly directly with the results of binary population synthesis codes and are therefore a strong test of population synthesis models for binary stars .    following on from the detection of many binary stars by maxted et al .",
    ", we started a project to measure their orbits .",
    "the orbit of one of the new binary stars has been presented in maxted et al .  .",
    "in this paper we present the orbits of a further 22 systems .",
    "we then consider the implications of the known sdb binary stars for their evolution .",
    "it should be noted that our sample is biased against sdb stars with g / k - type companions as the majority of our stars were selected from the pg survey which excludes most stars that show a caii h - line .",
    "the data used in this study were taken with the intermediate dispersion spectrograph ( ids ) at the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope ( int ) on the island of la palma .",
    "two different configurations of the ids were used for the observations . the first setup consisted of the 500 mm camera with the r1200r grating centred in  and the tek ( 1kx1k ) charge couple device ( ccd ) giving a dispersion of 0.37 / pix and a resolution of 0.9 .",
    "the second setup used the 235 mm camera with the r1200b grating centred at 4350  and the thinned eev10 ( 2kx4k ) ccd covering the bamer lines from  to h@xmath6 , giving a dispersion of 0.48 / pix and a resolution of 1.4 .",
    "we carried out the observations during six different runs .",
    "the dates when the observations were taken and the setup used during each campaign are given in table  [ obs : joo ] .",
    "we took two consecutive observations of each object and bracketed them with cuar plus cune frames to calibrate the spectra in wavelength .",
    "we subtracted from each image a constant bias level determined from the mean value in its over - scan region .",
    "tungsten flatfield frames were obtained each night to correct for the pixel to pixel response variations of the chip .",
    "sky flatfields were also obtained to correct for the pixel to pixel variations of the chip along the slit .",
    "after debiasing and flatfielding the frames , spectral extraction proceeded according to the optimal algorithm of marsh .",
    "the arcs were extracted using the profile associated with their corresponding target to avoid systematic errors caused by the spectra being tilted .",
    "uncertainties on every point were propagated through every stage of the data reduction .",

    "marsh , dhillon &  duck derived the following equation ( their a4 ) for the probability of a binary star of orbital frequency @xmath8 versus a single star given a set of radial velocity data , @xmath9 @xmath10 where the vector @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 and the matrix @xmath13 is @xmath14    with @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the uncertainty on the @xmath17-th point and @xmath18 , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the time of the @xmath17-th point ; @xmath21 is the measured radial velocity for the @xmath17-th point .",
    "the term inside the brackets of the exponential is equal to the difference in @xmath22 between adopting a constant velocity model versus a model of a constant plus a sinusoid , @xmath23 .",
    "that is , it is a measure of the gain one makes by adding a sinusoid to a constant model . since the constant model @xmath24 is independent of frequency , this is the justification for our statement in the main text that the probability of a certain period is dominated by the term @xmath25 .    already some assumptions have gone into this result which is the end product of integrating over the systemic velocity and the sine and cosine amplitudes for a given frequency . in particular",
    "we took the prior probabilities over these parameters to be uniform in a box extending from @xmath26 to @xmath27 in systemic velocity , and @xmath28 to @xmath29 in each of the semi - amplitudes ( a factor 4 has entered into eq .",
    "[ eq : integral ] compared to the original version from marsh , dhillon &  duck to account for a factor 2 change in our definition of these ranges ) .",
    "we continue to adopt this prior , largely because it then leads to a tractable integral , but also because it is hard to justify any particular choice of prior , and so one might as well adopt the simplest ( although see below for more on this ) .",
    "[ eq : integral ] is correct , given our assumptions , as long as the volume of integration wholly encloses the integrand in the systemic velocity / semi - amplitude space .",
    "the integrand is a 3d gaussian centred upon the best - fit values .",
    "for good enough data , this will occupy a small region , comparable in dimension to the uncertainties quoted on these parameters .",
    "at least this is the case for the best - fit frequency , but it is less clear that it will always be the case . to account for the case where a significant fraction of the integrand lies outside the integration region , we wrote a program that calculated the value of eq .",
    "[ eq : integral ] and , in addition , a correction to it from a monte carlo integration .",
    "essentially this computes the fraction of the integrand lying outside the volume of integration .",
    "a detail was that we changed the volume of integration to a cylinder with axis along the systemic velocity axis and radius @xmath30 , which gives a uniform prior in orbital phase as one expects .",
    "the monte carlo work was carried out by computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath13 and then generating points scattered around the maximum using gaussian random number generators to define the multiple of each eigenvector to use .",
    "the correction factor was then the ratio of the number of points that fell within the volume of integration to the total number of points generated . in practice our data was good enough that none of this made much difference to the results .",
    "we adopted a value of @xmath31 and set @xmath30 by taking the maximum companion mass to be @xmath32 .",
    "there is certainly a case for having a prior in the systemic velocity that falls off more gradually from a peak close to zero .",
    "a gaussian for example could still be accommodated analytically by a small modification of the matrix @xmath13 , however we feel that the greater ease of understanding of a uniform prior is an advantage that should not be wasted .",
    "what this means in practice is that we will over- or under - estimate the probabilities listed in table  [ tab : probs ] according to whether the best - fit systemic velocity is far from or close to zero velocity .",
    "this is a quantitative manifestation of the lack of confidence one would have in an orbit with a systemic velocity of , say , @xmath33 compared to a more moderate one .",
    "similar remarks apply to the prior for @xmath34 .",
    "the uncertainty over the priors is why the final probabilities are themselves subject to uncertainty .",
    "the final step was to integrate the probability as a function of frequency over ranges of frequency .",
    "the only technical difficulty here is that the integrand over frequency is extremely peaky with large ranges of very low probability pierced by narrow spikes of high probability .",
    "there is little one can do about this apart from computing the integrand over a very finely spaced series of frequencies .",
    "we applied straightforward trapezoidal integration , halving the spacing of the frequency grid until the integral converged .",
    "typically this required of the order of one million points , but did not take overly long on any one object .",
    "the same points about the systemic velocity and semi - amplitude priors applies to the prior over frequency .",
    "we took a prior uniform in frequency , but this has no particular justification .",
    "the final probability is uncertain to the extent that this prior deviates from reality .",
    "a factor of 10 would not especially surprise us here ."
