    "since the first discovery of @xmath0 hypernuclei by observing cosmic - rays in emulsion chambers,@xcite hypernuclei  which are nuclei with one or more of the nucleons being replaced with hyperons  have been used as a natural laboratory to study hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath5 ) and hyperon - hyperon ( @xmath6 ) interactions , properties of hadrons in nuclear environment , and in particular the impurity effect of hyperon in nuclear medium .",
    "@xcite due to the absence of pauli s principle between the nucleon and the @xmath0 particle , a @xmath0 hyperon can probe deeply into the interior of nuclear medium and have important influences on its properties , including softening the equation of state,@xcite modifying the shape and size of finite nucleus ,  @xcite changing the nuclear binding and thus the driplines of neutrons and protons  @xcite as well as the fission barrier heights in heavy nuclei .",
    "@xcite the facilities built at j - parc will provide an opportunity to perform hypernuclear @xmath7-ray spectroscopy study with high precision by improving the quality of the secondary mesonic beam.@xcite these facilities offer useful tools to study the low - lying states of hypernuclei .    in recent years , both the non - relativistic skyrme - hartree - fock ( shf )  @xcite and the relativistic mean - field ( rmf )  @xcite approaches have been applied to study the polarization effect of @xmath0 hyperon on the deformation of atomic nuclei .",
    "it has been found that , generally , the shape polarization effect of the @xmath0 hyperon is not evident , but with several exceptions , including @xmath8c , @xmath9c , and @xmath10@xmath11si . in these studies , however , the predicted energy surface is shown to be somewhat soft , in which case a large shape fluctuation effect of collective vibration might be expected .",
    "furthermore , symmetry ( e.g. , translation , rotation , particle number ) is usually spontaneously broken in the single - reference ( sr ) edfs .",
    "the symmetry restoration becomes particular important for studying the spectrum of low - lying states .",
    "recently , the low - lying states of @xmath0 hypernuclei have been studied with the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) model,@xcite in which the projection techniques and generator coordinate method ( gcm ) have been implemented to take into account the above deficiencies of static mean - field approaches .",
    "as the gaussian overlap approximation of gcm , the collective bohr hamiltonian with parameters determined by the self - consistent mean - field calculations is much simple in numerical calculations , and has achieved great success in description of the low - lying states of normal nuclei .",
    "@xcite in view of these facts , most recently , we have constructed a five - dimensional collective hamiltonian ( 5dch ) with the parameters derived from the shf+bcs calculations for the nuclear core @xmath12 mg and calculated the corresponding low - spin excitation spectra .",
    "@xcite the sgii force  @xcite for the @xmath2 effective interaction and the no.1 set in ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath3 interaction were adopted .",
    "it has been shown that the @xmath0 hyperon stretches the ground state band and reduces the @xmath13 value by @xmath14 , mainly by softening the potential energy surface towards the spherical shape .",
    "similar conclusion has also been found in the amd study for @xmath12 mg quite recently.@xcite    in this paper , we apply the same framework of ref .",
    "@xcite to quantitatively evaluate the impurity effect of @xmath0 hyperon on the collectivity of shape - coexistence nucleus @xmath1s with several different skyrme forces for both the @xmath2 and @xmath3 effective interactions as well as different pairing strengths for nucleons .",
    "the framework of skyrme energy functionals based collective hamiltonian for nuclear core of @xmath0 hypernuclei has been explained in detail in ref .  @xcite . here",
    ", we just present an outline . in this model , we start from the collective hamiltonian that describes the nuclear excitations of quadrupole vibrations , 3d rotations , and their couplings  @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the collective potential . the vibrational kinetic energy reads , @xmath17 \\right.\\nonumber\\\\    & &   \\left.+\\frac{1}{\\beta\\sin{3\\gamma } } \\left [     -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\gamma } \\sqrt{\\frac{r}{w}}\\sin{3\\gamma }        b_{\\beta \\gamma}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\beta }      + \\frac{1}{\\beta}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\gamma } \\sqrt{\\frac{r}{w}}\\sin{3\\gamma }        b_{\\beta \\beta}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\gamma }     \\right]\\right\\ } ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the rotational kinetic energy , @xmath18 with @xmath19 denoting the components of the angular momentum in the body - fixed frame of a nucleus .",
    "the mass parameters @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , as well as the moments of inertia @xmath23 , depend on the quadrupole deformation variables @xmath24 and @xmath7 , @xmath25 two additional quantities that appear in the expression for the vibrational energy , that is , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , determine the volume element in the collective space .",
    "the dynamics of the collective hamiltonian is governed by seven collective quantities , that is , the collective potential @xmath28 , three mass parameters @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , and three moments of inertia @xmath23 , all of which are determined by the constrained shf+bcs calculations for the nuclei with and without @xmath0 hyperon .",
    "recently , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the computer code ev8  @xcite of shf+bcs approach has been extended for the study of @xmath0 hypernuclei , which makes it feasible to carry out the quantitative study of @xmath0 effect on nuclear collectivity .    in the shf+bcs calculations for @xmath0 hypernucleus",
    ", the total energy @xmath29 can be written as the integration of three terms , @xmath30,\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the standard nuclear part of skyrme energy functional.@xcite @xmath32 is the kinetic energy density of @xmath0 hyperon .",
    "@xmath33 is the interaction energy density between the @xmath0 and nucleons given in terms of the @xmath0 and nucleon densities,@xcite @xmath34 here , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are respectively the particle density , the kinetic energy density , and the spin density of the @xmath0 hyperon .",
    "these quantities are given in terms of the single - particle wave - function of @xmath0 and occupation probabilities.@xcite @xmath37 , and @xmath38 are the skyrme parameters for the @xmath3 interaction .    the pairing correlation between the nucleons is taken into account in the bcs approximation . the density - dependent @xmath39-force is adopted in the @xmath40 channel , @xmath41   \\delta({{\\mathbf{r}}}_1-{{\\mathbf{r}}}_2),\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the spin - exchange operator , and @xmath43 @xmath44 .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the potential energy curves ( pecs ) from the shf+bcs calculations with several skyrme forces for @xmath1s and @xmath45s , where the no.1 set of @xmath3 effective interactions in ref .",
    "@xcite and pairing strength @xmath46 mev @xmath47 are adopted .",
    "it is shown that the pecs of @xmath1s by the sgii  @xcite and sly5  @xcite forces have two obvious minima in both oblate and prolate sides .",
    "the pecs by other skyrme forces are very similar and soft along @xmath24 direction around the spherical shape .",
    "similar situation is also found in @xmath45s . even though these skyrme forces predict somewhat different pecs for @xmath1s , the resultant polarization effects of @xmath0 by these forces are quite similar , as shown in the panel ( c ) of fig .",
    "moreover , the behavior of the difference between the pecs of @xmath1s and @xmath45s indicates that the @xmath0 has the effect of driving the nucleus to be of small deformation , i.e. , reducing the nuclear collectivity .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we plot the ratios of spectroscopic observables for nuclear core of @xmath45s to those for @xmath1s from the 5dch calculations with parameters determined by the shf+bcs calculations with several different skyrme forces .",
    "the experimental excitation energy of @xmath48 state ( @xmath49 ) in @xmath1s is indicated with a vertical dotted line .",
    "we note that the @xmath49 of @xmath1s by the sgii , sly5 and siii  @xcite forces are much smaller than those by skm * , t6 and skp forces , which can be understood from the pecs in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , except the case of siii force .",
    "namely , the collective wavefunctions of @xmath48 state by the calculations of sgii and sly5 forces are more concentrated on the obvious deformed minima of the pecs with larger moments of inertia . on the other hand ,",
    "it shows clearly that the @xmath50 is reduced by the @xmath0 hyperon .",
    "in particular , these different skyrme forces give similar results of @xmath0 impurity effect in @xmath1s , i.e. , the @xmath0 impurity effect on collectivity of @xmath1s is within @xmath4 .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] displays the low - spin spectra for the @xmath1s and the nuclear core of @xmath45s obtained by the 5dch calculations with the parameters determined by the calculations of siii  @xcite ( @xmath2 ) and no.1  @xcite ( @xmath3 ) skyrme forces .",
    "the experimental data for @xmath1s are taken from refs .",
    "it is shown that the spectrum of @xmath1s is reproduced very well and the effect of @xmath0 hyperon on the low - spin states in @xmath1s is generally small .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the pecs obtained by the shf+bcs calculations with both the siii and sly4  @xcite forces , and with different pairing strengths for @xmath1s and @xmath45s .",
    "the no.1 ( adjusted based on the siii ) of ref .",
    "@xcite and the  hp120310 \" ( adjusted based on the sly4 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite are adopted for @xmath3 effective interactions respectively .",
    "it is shown that the pairing strengths for nucleons do have influence on the topology of pecs for @xmath1s . however , it has a negligible effect on the polarization effect of @xmath0 hyperon .",
    "moreover , it is shown again that the polarization effect of @xmath0 hyperon in @xmath1s is similar for the siii and sly4 forces .",
    "subsequently , we perform the further 5dch calculations using only the siii force , but different pairing strengths for nucleons .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] displays the corresponding spectroscopic properties of low - spin states for @xmath1s and nuclear core of @xmath45s as functions of pairing strength @xmath51 for nucleons .",
    "it shows clearly and quantitatively that the excitation energies of @xmath52 and @xmath53 states in @xmath1s increase monotonically and dramatically with the pairing strengths , which can be understood that the strong pairing generally drives the nucleus to be more spherical .",
    "similar phenomenon has also been shown in the covariant edf based 5dch calculations.@xcite however , the impurity effect of @xmath0 on nuclear collectivity is not much sensitive to the pairing strength for nucleons , which varies within @xmath4 for different pairing strengths .",
    "the non - relativistic skyrme edf based 5dch , that takes into account dynamical correlations related to the restoration of broken symmetries and fluctuations of quadrupole collective variables , has been applied to quantitatively study the impurity effect of @xmath0 hyperon on collective excitation of shape - coexistence nucleus @xmath1s .",
    "several skyrme forces for both the @xmath2 and @xmath3 effective interactions have been used .",
    "the influence of pairing strengths on the polarization effect of @xmath0 hyperon has been also examined .",
    "it has been found that although these skyrme forces give somewhat different low - lying spectra for @xmath1s , they give similar and generally small size of @xmath0 polarization effect ( within @xmath4 ) on the spectroscopic observables .",
    "moreover , the pairing strength between nucleons has significant influence on the nuclear collectivity , but negligible effect on the polarization effect of @xmath0 hyperon .    with the skyrme edf based 5dch model , the systematic study of @xmath0 impurity effect on collectivity of atomic nuclei in different mass region is in progress.@xcite moreover , as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , the polarization effect of @xmath0 hyperon might be stronger in the calculations with covariant edfs .",
    "the quantitative evaluation of @xmath0 effect on nuclear collectivity will provide a good way to constrain @xmath54 effective interaction in covariant edf .",
    "furthermore , to calculate the low - spin spectra for the whole single @xmath0 hypernucleus , one has to extend the current edf based 3damp+gcm  @xcite or 5dch models for odd - mass/-odd nuclei .",
