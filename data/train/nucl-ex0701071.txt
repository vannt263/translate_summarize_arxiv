    "direct photons , i.e. those not originating from hadron decays , are an interesting tool to study the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) created in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite .    _ thermal _ direct photons are expected to be radiated by the electric charges in the qgp and the hadron gas , which is formed in a later stage of the expansion .",
    "a measurement of thermal photons can thus provide information on the temperature evolution of the system @xcite .",
    "_ prompt _ direct photons originate from initial hard scatterings .",
    "they allow to verify scaling assumptions of initial parton densities and may be used to tag recoiling jets and study jet quenching with a calibrated probe @xcite .",
    "in addition their yield has to be known for studies of thermal photons , because they form a background to the latter .",
    "it is expected that at rhic thermal photons are most abundantly produced in au+au collisions , which are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we investigate direct photon production in p+p and d+au collisions in order to compare prompt photon measurements to pqcd predictions and study modifications in cold nuclear matter .",
    "both measurements will constitute a necessary reference to interpret the photon results obtained from au+au collisions .",
    "the data presented here were taken with the star detector @xcite in the 2003 d+au and 2005 p+p run at rhic , both at @xmath1 .",
    "the main detectors for this analysis are the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter ( bemc ) @xcite , the barrel shower maximum detector ( bsmd ) @xcite , and the time projection chamber ( tpc ) @xcite . in order to enhance the raw particle yield at high transverse momentum ( @xmath2 ) an",
    "online trigger selected events with a high transverse energy deposition in a single bemc cell .",
    "more details on this direct photon analysis are given in @xcite .",
    "this analysis aims to measure the direct photon yield by means of a statistical subtraction of the hadronic decay background .",
    "the largest contribution to this background comes from the decay @xmath3 .",
    "it is therefore essential to measure the pion spectrum with high precision .",
    "inclusive photon candidates were identified by a clustering algorithm based on the energy measured in the bemc and on the lateral shower profile measured in the bsmd .",
    "the latter is essential to resolve the two @xmath0 decay photons at high @xmath2 . to identify neutral clusters and decrease hadronic background , a charged particle veto ( cpv )",
    "is provided by rejecting clusters with a pointing tpc track .",
    "the yield of decay photons has been determined from a monte - carlo simulation which had a fit to the measured pion spectrum as input .",
    "since there are no star measurements available for @xmath4 and @xmath5(782 ) yields , it was assumed that their transverse mass ( @xmath6 ) spectra are the same as that of the @xmath0 scaled by a constant which was taken from literature @xcite .",
    "the result of the simulation is shown in figure [ fig : bgphotons ] .",
    "other possible contributions to the decay background , such as @xmath7 and @xmath8 , were found to be negligible .",
    "showers from neutral hadrons and especially anti - neutrons can be misidentified as photons . to correct for this contamination of the inclusive photon yield",
    "a geant simulation of the detector was used which had the proton and anti - proton spectra as an input @xcite .",
    "the data have been corrected for reconstruction and trigger efficiencies , limited acceptance , photon conversions in the detector material in front of the bemc , and the inefficiency of the cpv .",
    "a convenient way of studying direct photons is by means of a double ratio @xmath9 where the numerator is the point by point ratio of the measured inclusive photon spectrum to the neutral pion spectrum and the denominator is the number of simulated decay photons per input pion shown in figure [ fig : bgphotons ] .",
    "the advantage of this ratio is that systematic uncertainties which are common to neutral pion and inclusive photon detection will largely cancel .",
    "figure [ fig : ratio_dau ] shows the @xmath10 measurement obtained from minimum bias d+au collisions at @xmath1 in terms of @xmath11 .",
    "the measurement is consistent with a pqcd calculation @xcite based on the cteq6 m parton density functions @xcite , the grv parton - to - photon @xcite , and the kkp parton - to - pion fragmentation functions @xcite as shown for three different factorization scales by the curves in figure [ fig : ratio_dau ] .",
    "the parton - to - photon fragmentation functions are included since this analysis does not make use of an isolation cut for the photon candidates .",
    "the dominant systematic error on the measurement of the @xmath0 yield ( @xmath1230% ) is due to the uncertainty of the bemc energy scale .",
    "this uncertainty largely cancels ( @xmath133% ) when calculating @xmath11 such that the @xmath0 yield extraction ( 510% ) and the statistical errors on the efficiency correction ( 510% ) are the most important contribution to the error on @xmath11 .",
    "figure [ fig : pions_pp ] shows the @xmath0 cross - section in p+p collisions as a function of @xmath2 . details of this analysis can be found in @xcite .",
    "the data is well described by a pqcd calculation in combination with the kkp set of fragmentation functions @xcite which is consistent with an earlier measurement at rhic @xcite .",
    "the direct photon analysis of the 2005 p+p data set is in progress .",
    "the combined d+au and p+p results will provide insight into nuclear effects and form a necessary baseline to study the properties of the qgp using direct photon measurements in au+au collisions .",
