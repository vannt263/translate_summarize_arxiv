    "the magellanic stream ( ms ) is our closest and most prominent example of a gaseous interaction remnant .",
    "while such circumgalactic structures are postulated to represent important sources of fuel for future star formation @xcite , the mechanisms whereby this material might be accreted back into galaxies remain unclear .",
    "as emphasized by @xcite , the multiphase nature of galactic halos plays an important role during the accretion process by modifying gas stripping and infall processes ( for additional perspectives on these issues see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "being close by , the ms offers a unique laboratory to study the rate and nature of gas injected from satellites , as well as models to assess the fate of the stripped gas .",
    "the ms trails across much of the southern galactic sky behind the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) , passing near the southern galactic pole at about 1/3 of its length .",
    "it has been shown to have a continuous coherent velocity tracing across the southern galactic sky for @xmath7 @xcite , just penetrating the galactic plane at some unknown distance from the galactic center . direct distance constraints for the ms are difficult to establish much beyond the mcs themselves , which constrain the ms head nominally between @xmath8 and @xmath9  kpc , based on the mc distances established by @xcite and @xcite . with no embedded stars ,",
    "no nearby ionizing sources or stellar absorption sight lines yet detected , the mcs remain its only direct distance constraint .",
    "a geometrical - dynamical analysis by @xcite found a galactocentric distance that increased to @xmath10  kpc at about @xmath11 along the ms length .",
    "@xcite found a similar constraint at this point assuming that the neutral hydrogen ( hi ) clump size distribution is driven by the thermal instability ( ti ) .",
    "attempts to simulate the large - scale mechanism of formation and subsequent evolution of this extensive structure have focused mainly on tidal interactions with the galaxy and/or ram pressure stripping of the mc gas by the galactic halo .",
    "these simulations had moderate success when it was believed that the mcs have had multiple orbital cycles around the galaxy @xcite .",
    "however , global simulations have been made difficult in recent years given the relatively new constraint that the mcs are apparently on their first pass through the galactic system @xcite .",
    "@xcite developed a smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) global ms simulation in this first - pass scenario maintaining that neither tidal or ram pressure mechanisms are as sufficient as once thought to stripping the gas . both @xcite and @xcite",
    "propose other mechanisms to do the heavy lifting , unbinding the gas prior to stripping , through tidal resonances between the mcs in the former , and in the latter , a gas `` blowout '' from star formation in the lmc region that includes 30  doradus .",
    "whatever the mechanism by which the gas was removed from the mcs , ram pressure , tidal effects , initial turbulent energy , magnetic field structure and subsequent interactions with the galactic halo all may have played a role in sculpting the rich filamentary and clumpy structure revealed in figure  [ fig : mstoclump ] .",
    "this figure shows the scale of the entire ms on an hi image produced by the galactic all - sky survey ( gass , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and takes it down in steps to a specific small , but interesting cloud toward the downstream end which is the subject of this paper .",
    "the fine scale structure revealed in the gass image and in other recent hi observations such as @xcite and @xcite is not captured in the n - body and sph global models mentioned above .",
    "even finer structure was revealed by @xcite in high resolution mapping of the northern tip of the ms using the 305  meter dish at arecibo .",
    "these observations revealed extended fine filamentary structure and clumps down to the @xmath12 angular resolution of the telescope .",
    "several theoretical studies as well as numerical simulations have explored the effect of various hydrodynamic instabilities on the formation of small scale structure in warm gas such as the ms moving through a hot halo @xcite .",
    "however , it is still not clear how effective these processes are and on what timescales they operate .",
    "for example , most instabilities appear to act on short timescales ( @xmath13  myrs ) and therefore require that the ms is continuously replenished with fresh material .",
    "the nature and evolution of the small scale ms structure ( or stripped gas ) is also not well understood .",
    "as such material may eventually constitute a substantial source for the mw s star formation in the form of infalling warm ionized gas ( so called  warm drizzle ",
    "* ) , observational constraints on the physical processes operating on small spatial scales in the ms are highly important .",
    "numerous observational studies have revealed a multi - phase nature in ms gas . @xcite",
    "and @xcite showed that about 15% of the observed hi clouds have velocity profiles composed of warm and cool components , with a velocity fwhm of about 25 km  s@xmath14 and 3 - 15 km  s@xmath14 , respectively .",
    "matthews et al .",
    "( 2009 ) detected the first hi absorption lines against radio background sources in the direction of the ms close to the mcs indicating spin temperature of 70 - 80 k. h@xmath15 measurements of the warm ionized component in the ms exist @xcite , but with only a few discrete pointings and with the large @xmath16 apertures , providing little insight into the processes on the small , arc minute scales .    while not being able to provide any spatial information , numerous uv and optical absorption studies have been crucial for constraining the abundance of the ms gas @xcite . in addition , detections of ovi absorption from gas associated with the ms by @xcite give strong support for the existence of an ionized component around the ms with @xmath17 k. it is generally interpreted that this component represents an interface between the hot halo gas at @xmath18 k @xcite and the cooler ms gas .",
    "studies of lower ionization states suggest the existence of diffuse envelopes of somewhat cooler , partially ionized gas that is not visible in the current hi surveys .",
    "specifically , siiii likely probes different phases than ovi with @xmath19 k @xcite and has been detected along a sight - line in the northern ms with velocities associated with the ms @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite have performed an analysis of many low and high ion species in uv and optical absorption , including siiii , against background source . from this work ,",
    "a picture emerges of a diffuse , multi - phase transition structure between the warm , mostly neutral envelope gas detected in hi and the hot , mostly ionized envelope gas detected in ovi .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the rich multi - phase structure of the ms suggests cloud longevity and a slow mass ablation rate . the kelvin - helmholtz instability ( kh ) driven by shear flow between cool ms gas and the hot halo is likely to be the dominant mode of cool cloud disruption and relatively rapid ablation compared to evaporation through pure thermal conduction .",
    "however , analytical and numerical treatments of cool gas in a hot flow suggest that the rapid ablation by kh can be moderated by factors affecting the turbulent mixture in the boundary layer .",
    "these include magnetic fields @xcite , re - cooling of heated gas @xcite and even thermal conduction acting locally within the mixture @xcite .",
    "the focus of this paper is to probe and characterize properties of this boundary layer between cool hi clouds in the ms and the surrounding halo gas .",
    "this requires very deep hi observations , more sensitive than the existing hi surveys .",
    "for example , the predominantly ionized component detected by @xcite has the total column density of @xmath20 and a neutral fraction of @xmath21 . to detect the corresponding neutral gas we require hi column density sensitivity of @xmath22 .",
    "this is at least 5 times lower than the most sensitive hi survey to date ; gass @xcite which achieves @xmath0 column density sensitivity of @xmath23 .",
    "we approach the required sensitivity by applying a new method of spatial averaging to characterize a cloud in the northern ms ( shown in figure  [ fig : mstoclump ] ) observed with very deep hi emission spectra obtained with the green bank telescope ( gbt ) .",
    "our analysis also benefits from the fortuitous location of the seyfert  1 background source near the cloud s center which was extensively studied in uv and optical absorption by @xcite ( hereafter referred to as fsw10 ) .",
    "our observing and data reduction strategies are presented in section  [ sec : observations ] . section  [ sec : results ] explains the new spatial averaging method we applied to the cloud to achieve @xmath24 sensitivity and probe the usually inaccessible cloud periphery and highly ionized cloud envelope .",
    "we also develop a simple 3d cloud model matched to our observations to obtain a robust estimate of cloud s properties and gain insight into the internal cloud structure and processes acting at its periphery . in sections  [ sub :",
    "discussion : envelope ] and [ sub : discussion : core ] , we show that the cloud properties along with results from fsw10 strongly suggest an integral wnm / wim core transitioning to a turbulent mixing layer ( tml ) and in section  [ sub : discussion : ionization ] , we investigate how consistent the cloud s neutral density characteristics are with a photo - ionizing environment by comparing the model to the results of 3d ionization equilibrium simulations . finally , in section  [ sub : discussion : lifetime ] we discuss the lifetime of the cloud and assess the possibility of eventually reaching the galactic disk where a portion of its mass could help fuel star formation .",
    "we summarize our results in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we used the gbt in 2009 and 2010 as part of a larger program to map several sample regions in the northern portion of the ms .",
    "one of these regions is located in the northern tip of the ms and was chosen , among other reasons , to include the ngc  7469 background source .",
    "the beam size of the gbt in the 21 cm line is 9.1@xmath25 , which corresponds to 183 pc at @xmath26 , a distance consistent with estimates by @xcite and @xcite which we will assume hereafter .",
    "observations were obtained using the on - the - fly ( otf ) mapping mode with in - band frequency switching .",
    "constant declination ( dec ) rows were scanned and stepped every @xmath12 in order to oversample the beam by 2.6 in the dec direction .",
    "spectra were dumped at twice that resolution so that beam - spreading in the right ascension ( ra ) direction due to scanning remained small ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the @xmath28  second target integration time per @xmath12 pixel was split into four separate scans , which reduced the impact of transient signals such as radio frequency interference ( rfi ) and spectrometer glitches . the gbt spectrometer was used with a bandwidth of 12.5 mhz and 16384 channels , corresponding to a velocity resolution of @xmath29 .",
    "the gbt data were reduced using a combination of the gbtidl and aips data reduction packages , and a suite of specially designed interactive data language@xmath30 ( idl ) programs . to ensure high sensitivity ,",
    "special care was taken during the baseline calibration process .",
    "first , a modified version of the gbtidl getfs procedure was used to obtain reference spectra to produce temperature - calibrated spectra with gross baseline calibration . instead of using a frequency - shifted total power reference spectrum or a smoothed version of it , as is normally done , a noiseless 3rd order baseline model of a line - suppressed total power reference spectrum",
    "was used for reference .",
    "this improves the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) by @xmath31 without enhancing large - scale baseline structure noise which degrades its gaussian character .",
    "the line - suppressed spectrum was obtained by selecting the minimum of either the reference or signal spectrum at each frequency .",
    "this `` min filter '' statistically prefers samples without a positive bias from emission of any kind and so reduces image artifacts in the final spectra and adds a fixed offset to the baseline , easily removed in the following steps .",
    "the derived reference spectrum was then used to perform a @xmath32 calibration of each spectrum .",
    "the spectra were then scaled by the system temperature and corrected for atmospheric opacity using the standard , built - in correction provided by gbtidl routines .    in the next step ,",
    "the calibrated and roughly baselined spectra pass through two additional baseline removal phases .",
    "each of these include multiple steps where baselines are modeled and subtracted . in all but one case , baselines are modeled as 3rd order polynomial functions only after excluding galactic emission and subtracting unblended gaussian models of any detected emission lines in the spectrum . in the first phase , the baseline of the scan average for the x polarization is modeled and then subtracted from each spectrum in that scan .",
    "the baselined x emission is then subtracted from the y polarization , effectively suppressing all emission under the reasonable assumption in this case that the emission is unpolarized .",
    "this leaves only the y baseline , which is modeled to 7th order .",
    "this special step removes the small @xmath33  mhz sinusoidal baseline component present in the y polarization of gbt spectra , probably due to double transit reflections from the feed to the circumferential gap between main reflector panels @xcite .",
    "it also removes the average offset introduced by the min filter mentioned previously . in the second step , each individual spectrum s",
    "residual baseline differences from the average are removed in two iterations .",
    "after baselining , spectra from identical pointings were combined and interpolated to a regular grid with pixel size one fourth that of the sampling interval ( or @xmath34 ) using the aips task sdgrd .",
    "this over - sampled the telescope beam by a factor of ten in the final data cube , providing interpolated resolution to support precise averaging along circular paths when spatial averaging techniques are applied to the cube .",
    "velocity spectra were smoothed with a 6th order hanning window , reducing the resolution to @xmath35 .",
    "the velocity range was truncated to @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "the rms noise in the final data cube was measured at @xmath38  mk by averaging across emission - free velocity ranges .",
    "this corresponds to column density noise @xmath39 for a @xmath40 fwhm profile .",
    "this is almost four times better than the @xmath41 noise achieved by gass , the most sensitive survey to date @xcite when scaled to the same fwhm line width of @xmath40 .",
    "this sensitivity is provided at the gbt beamwidth of @xmath42 compared to the parkes telescope s @xmath43 .",
    "in the data cube we unexpectedly found a roughly circularly projected , mostly isolated hi cloud in the ms , located only @xmath44 from the direction of the well - studied seyfert  1 background source ngc  7469 .",
    "figure  [ fig : clumpmaps ]    shows the hi column density ( zeroth moment ) and velocity ( first moment , intensity - weighted ) images of the cube over the velocity range @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "the cloud size is @xmath47beamwidth .",
    "after de - convolving the telescope beam , the intrinsic cloud size is @xmath48beamwidth .",
    "the cloud is therefore just resolved .",
    "the hi column density at the cloud center is @xmath49 @xmath2 and although it trails off to the north , east and south , it connects to the cloud complex to the west .",
    "the velocity image shows that this connection involves an abrupt @xmath50 velocity shift from the @xmath51 gas at the cloud s apparent western edge to the neighboring @xmath52 component labeled `` a '' of the western complex , which is mixed in with a nearby @xmath53 component labeled `` b '' .",
    "note also that the cloud itself has a distinct @xmath54 gradient from west to east .",
    "the abrupt positive velocity shift from the western complex along with the continued positive gradient across the cloud suggests it may have broken off from the complex and is becoming entrained in the surrounding ambient gas .",
    "figure  [ fig : hicentspect ] shows the hi spectrum at the center of the cloud .",
    "the emission clearly has a component at @xmath55 with a @xmath56 .",
    "however , an even lower level , broad component lies at slightly more negative los velocities as made evident by the two - component gaussian fit overlaid on the spectrum .",
    "the width and weakness of the wider envelope line causes us to consider the possibility that it is an artifact of the baseline removal process , but we reject that as there is independent evidence of components associated with both the core and envelope line velocities in the uv absorption spectra along the nearby ngc  7469 sight line reported in fsw10 ( discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] ) .        to enhance sensitivity of our observations and characterize how properties of the two components evolve outward from the cloud center , we introduce the spatial averaging method and apply it to the data cube in section  [ sub : spaavemeth : rawcloudprofile ] .",
    "this produces a profile of average column spectra versus projected angular distance , @xmath57 from the center with increasing sensitivity , well past its apparent periphery . in section  [ sub :",
    "spaavemeth : linemodeling ] we purge the average profile of components that are unassociated with the cloud . finally , in section  [ sub:3dcloudmodel ] , we develop a simple parametric 3d spherical model of the cloud optimally matched to the purged 2d projected profile to obtain a robust estimate of the properties and structure of the cloud versus physical distance , @xmath58 from its physical center outward .      to perform spatial averaging of hi spectra",
    "we start with the following assumptions : ( i ) the cloud is roughly circularly symmetric , ( ii ) the cloud symmetry extends past its apparent boundaries , and ( iii ) along each line of sight on a circular annulus from the cloud center , hi gas has similar properties .",
    "the small velocity gradient of @xmath54 on the eastern side of the clump ( figure  [ fig : clumpmaps](b ) , discussed above ) shows that the symmetry assumption is compromised , but the gradient is relatively small with respect to the width of both cloud components identified in the central spectrum of figure  [ fig : hicentspect ] .",
    "its effect on the results of the averaging process that follows are considered in sections  [ sub : spaavemeth : linemodeling ] and [ sub:3dcloudmodel ] .",
    "we start from the pixel with the highest hi brightness temperature ( see figure  [ fig : clumpmaps ] ) and average hi spectra spatially along circular annuli of increasing projected radius @xmath57 . as a result",
    ", we can plot the averaged hi spectra as a function of projected angular distance from the cloud center as shown in figure  [ fig : spectprofilelinemod](a ) .",
    "the most important advantage of this spatial averaging method is that it reduces the noise without compromising angular resolution in the essential radial dimension , which contains most of the spatial information in the nominally circularly projected cloud .",
    "the noise improvement in the averaged spectra increases with @xmath57 due to an increasing averaging path length , thus compensating for decreasing emission from the cloud center .",
    "assuming infinite resolution and uncorrelated , zero mean noise at each pixel , the measurement error for a circular cloud theoretically decreases as @xmath59 .",
    "in reality , error improvement will be limited to the extent that the noise is zero mean and uncorrelated from pixel to pixel .",
    "the normal gridding process increases pixel - to - pixel correlation , while residual structure from imperfect baseline modeling violates both of these criteria and will generally be the limiting factor in most applications of this method . while we apply the method here to a roughly circular cloud , we note that the same method can be applied on filamentary structures by assuming linear symmetry and averaging along lines parallel to the filament main axis .",
    "the result of the spatial averaging method is shown in figure  [ fig : spectprofilelinemod](a ) .",
    "on the x - axis we plot the averaged hi spectra at a given projected distance @xmath57 from the cloud center , shown on the y - axis .",
    "the first spectrum at @xmath60 corresponds to the single hi spectrum through the cloud center ( shown in figure 3 ) , and is dominated by the main emission component centered at @xmath61 . as @xmath57 increases , the primary emission component weakens and the broader , underlying component strengthens as the sensitivity improves .",
    "there is also a distinct blue - ward velocity gradient in the broad component spectrum as @xmath57 increases .",
    "the distinct narrow and broad emission components of the cloud are suggestive of a spherical structure with a ( kinematically ) warm core and a warmer envelope : with increasing @xmath57 , the line of sight passes through less of the core and more of the envelope and eventually , the envelope dominates through limb brightening .",
    "we explore this further through modeling in section  [ sub:3dcloudmodel ] .",
    "in addition to emission at the main component velocities , there appear to be one or more weak lines in the spectrum that are well separated from the main emission ( _ e.g. _ , at @xmath62 ) and therefore assumed to be unassociated with it",
    ". the evolving profile also contains components at similar velocities , but unrelated to the cloud s central components as the widening circle of averaging passes through clumps of emission that are spatially separated on the sky .",
    "these are also assumed to be unassociated . in the next step , these unassociated components are purged from the projected profile .      using a semi - manual process aided by a graphically interactive program written in idl , all hi spectra in the averaged profile",
    "were modeled as multiple , blended gaussian functions .",
    "the process is as follows : each hi spectrum of the profile is viewed in order of increasing @xmath57 and initial estimates of all potential gaussian components are provided by the user to a blended gaussian fitting routine .",
    "each component of the resulting fit is then checked and any with @xmath63 are removed with the remaining components used as initial conditions for a second fit . at this point , since gaussian decomposition is not unique , the user views the fit and can accept it or try again with new initial estimates .",
    "the result of this modeling process is shown in figure  [ fig : spectprofilelinemod](b ) . while many unrelated lines pop in and out with increasing @xmath57 , there are two main gaussian components that maintain continuity from @xmath60",
    "outward and so are considered to be the components of the cloud .",
    "all others are to be subtracted .",
    "it is important to stress that the purpose of this line modeling step is _ not _ to accurately model all the emission in the profile but only to identify and subtract components in the observed profile that are likely to be unrelated to the cloud . the resultant `` cleaned '' profile , which contains only the two observed primary components directly associated with the cloud , is shown in [ fig : spectprofilelinemod](c ) .",
    "note that there is a prominent discontinuity in the cleaned profile which occurs at the point where the broad component becomes undetectable as part of the blended fit underneath two rising , but unrelated components that dominate it .",
    "this is an artifact of imperfect line modeling .",
    "where the broad component is too weak to contribute its own line model to the blended fit , the other components incorporate it into their line models and then it gets subtracted .",
    "another limitation of the line modeling is cross - coupling , where a stronger component affects the parameters of a weaker overlapping component .",
    "these effects are not easily quantified and could dominate any uncertainties due to noise alone .",
    "imperfections notwithstanding , the lines associated with the two components of the cloud are modeled as part of the cleaning process and provide a rough model of the cleaned profile as shown in figure  [ fig : spectprofilelinemod](d ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : specprofilelineparms ] shows how the modeled line width , central velocity , and hi column density parameters of these two components evolve with @xmath57 . .",
    "figure  [ fig : specprofilelineparms](a ) shows that the two components have distinctly different line widths .",
    "the narrow core component has a relatively constant @xmath64 while the broader envelope has an apparently large outward gradient from @xmath65 at cloud center to @xmath66 at @xmath67 where the line falls below threshold .",
    "although the gradient may be exaggerated by parameter cross - coupling with the core component at low @xmath57 and with subtracted components at higher @xmath57 , it could be significant and is physically consistent with turbulent and/or thermal broadening as it approaches the hot ambient halo medium .",
    "the central velocity profiles of figure  [ fig : specprofilelineparms](b ) illustrate the parameter coupling concerns mentioned previously . at small @xmath57 the stronger core component may `` pull '' the velocity of the weaker envelope , while the roles are reversed at @xmath68 , where the core weakens and its velocity drops sharply toward the envelope s .",
    "the sharp drop in core velocity and the step change in envelope velocity are probably not entirely real .",
    "the core velocity is likely constant for the most part at @xmath69 with the sharp drop clearly a modeling artifact since this is not possible given the beam smoothing .",
    "the envelope s apparent negative velocity gradient may be exaggerated by `` pulling '' from the core at low @xmath57 but is large enough that it could be at least partially real , approaching @xmath52 at the periphery .",
    "gradient or not , there _ is _ a difference in the central velocity between the two components of between 4 and @xmath70 with the core component clearly _ lagging _ the envelope component along the los .",
    "this is very interesting because the large negative velocity of this cloud indicates infall and a cometary morphology with the core _ leading _ the envelope is expected .",
    "although the morphology may be hidden in projection or in the noise of figure  [ fig : clumpmaps ] , the core in the spatially integrated profile is clearly lagging in velocity .",
    "this is also apparent in figure  [ fig : hicentspect ] ( the central cloud spectrum ) indicating that this is not an artifact of the spatial averaging process . @xcite",
    "similarly modeled the line profiles of hvc125 + 41 - 207 along simple perpendicular cross sections ( _ i.e. _ , no spatial averaging ) and demonstrated that its projected on - sky head - tail morphology had a cold core leading a warmer envelope .",
    "similarly , many other hvcs with a head - tail structure have a lagging tail , which is usually interpreted as belonging to gas stripped and slowed down through interactions with the surrounding medium .",
    "this interesting , apparently anomalous velocity structure of our cloud is addressed in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "some of the gradient in line width and central velocity of figure  [ fig : specprofilelineparms](a ) and ( b ) could be caused by the velocity gradient asymmetry toward the eastern side of the clump .",
    "we discuss this in section  [ sub:3dcloudmodel ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : specprofilelineparms](c ) shows the well - behaved hi column density of the two components .",
    "the core component is roughly gaussian with fwhm  @xmath71 , only slightly larger than the @xmath3 beamwidth .",
    "this reflects the barely resolved core .",
    "the envelope component has an almost constant column density of @xmath72 .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the broad envelope component which has a significant hi column density even at large @xmath57 , constitutes a large portion of the cloud s total neutral mass and probably an even larger portion of its total mass since it is likely more highly ionized than the core . in section  [ sub:3dcloudmodel ]",
    "we quantify this in the context of the 3d cloud model developed there .    as a by - product of the component fitting process",
    "the residual noise of each averaged hi spectrum is measured after subtracting the line fit .",
    "this is plotted in figure  [ fig : refsensitivty ]        as a function of projected angular distance @xmath57 from the cloud center .",
    "this figure clearly demonstrates the extremely high sensitivity of this spatial averaging method , where @xmath73 reaches below @xmath74 at about @xmath75 from the cloud center .",
    "also plotted is the theoretical noise as discussed in section  [ sub : spaavemeth : linemodeling ] , which also incorporates the noise correlation effects of interpolation .",
    "measured noise does not improve as rapidly as it could , probably because of limited resolution and residual baseline artifacts at low @xmath57 and the correlation introduced by the gridding process as mentioned before .",
    "note that at the beamwidth , @xmath76 , correlation effects are minimal and the noise improvement approaches the theoretical limit . however , at @xmath77 , the averaging path begins to be truncated by the excluded region and then by the borders of the cube and so the noise flattens and begins to increase .",
    "we now use the two - dimensional projected profile of figure  [ fig : spectprofilelinemod](c ) to investigate a simple three - dimensional , core - envelope cloud model supporting our observational claims regarding the cloud structure . since the cloud is not spatially resolved well in our measurements , subtle spatial structure in the model",
    "is not appropriate , but since spectral resolution is very high , subtle spectral structure can be incorporated .",
    "we define a spherically symmetric cloud model with three spatial and one velocity dimension as :    @xmath78    where @xmath79 and cloud spatial coordinates @xmath80 are defined so that the @xmath81-axis is along the los , @xmath82 is east to west on the sky , while @xmath83 is north to south .",
    "the cloud consists of a core with a constant hi volume density @xmath84 and has a radius @xmath85 . beyond",
    "the core is the cloud envelope with a constant density @xmath86 which extends up to a radius of @xmath87 . at the cloud center , @xmath88 ,",
    "the core and envelope have a los velocity @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "the spectra of the core and envelope are gaussian functions centered at @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "the velocity dispersion @xmath91 of the core is allowed to linearly vary with @xmath58 , but the central velocity is held constant since the observed column profile ( figure  [ fig : specprofilelineparms ] ) shows little variation .",
    "significant gradient in the velocity and dispersion of the envelope is suggested by the profile , so both are allowed to vary linearly with @xmath58 .",
    "note that this model incorporates a radially dependent velocity scalar field that is restricted to the los component of the vector field . as such , the model ,",
    "although very sensitive to the directly measured los motions associated with a cometary feature seen in projection , is insensitive to radial motion from the cloud s 3d center .",
    "so , expansion or contraction effects can not be inferred from the model .",

    "the density of the modeled core scaled to this distance translates to @xmath130 @xmath128 , which is @xmath131 of that estimate , but the former is based on clumps with @xmath132 times the central column density so a higher neutral fraction is to be expected due to more effective self - shielding . the los velocity of the model core is constant , as constrained by the model , and the nominal velocity of the envelope gradually decreases from @xmath133 to @xmath134 .",

    "referring to table  [ tab : modcloudparms ] , note that this could account for most of the observed core line width gradient @xmath98 which is dominated by the uncertainty due to noise anyway , so the effect of the asymmetry on the core line width gradient is insignificant .",

    "using the highly sensitive analytical technique based on a simple 3d parametric model described in section  [ sec : results ] , we have obtained observational evidence of the cloud having a distinct neutral core with a wnm - like velocity line width , surrounded by an envelope with a much wider line width , described by the model parameters of figure  [ fig : cloudmodelparms ] .",
    "we now delve into physical interpretations of the observed spatial and kinematic structure .",
    "the most interesting and puzzling aspect of our results so far is the negative velocity offset of the envelope with respect to the core which ranges from @xmath174 at the center and gets larger further out to @xmath175 implying that in this infalling structure , the envelope , presumably consisting of gas components stripped from the core and entrained by the relatively static halo , is falling faster , _ leading _ the core .",
    "we would expect a typical cometary feature to develop with entrained , envelope gas trailing behind the core with a _ lagging _ velocity as found by @xcite in a structural analysis of hvc125 + 41207 previously mentioned in section  [ sub : spaavemeth : linemodeling ] .",
    "their analysis of highly resolved observations of the hvc revealed wnm - like gas in a cometary envelope surrounding a well - resolved cnm - like core .",
    "in contrast , our cloud s barely resolved wnm core corresponds to their entire cloud and our envelope corresponds to possible boundary gas surrounding their hvc , well below their detection threshold .",
    "still , we might expect an analogous structure in the boundary gas , in transition to the halo .",
    "our cloud shows no clear projected on - sky cometary feature , but given the high los velocity it would probably be hidden in full projection behind the cloud .",
    "however , this orientation would directly show the lagging envelope velocity signature of a cometary feature yet we see it clearly leading .",
    "the most likely explanation for the leading envelope is suggested by the velocity structure of figure  [ fig : clumpmaps](b ) which , as discussed in section  [ sec : results ] , indicates the cloud may be a large clump of entrained gas originating from the western complex and now lagging it .",
    "the detected envelope velocity range of @xmath52 to @xmath53 corresponds closely to the velocity range of the two nearby components ( a and b ) of the western complex .",
    "the detected envelope therefore , may be an extended , diffuse structure that both the cloud and the western complex are embedded in .",
    "although of low hi column density , @xmath176 @xmath2 , it is quite extensive and may contain a significant amount of hi .",
    "however , our spatial averaging method provides further constraints on the nature of the diffuse envelope .",
    "since the region excluded in the spatial averaging includes most of the extended structure and bridging gas to the west past @xmath177 from the cloud center , our 3d cloud model is not influenced by this western region .",
    "we can therefore assume that although the projected circular symmetry assumption of the averaging method is weaker , the core - envelope cloud model ( section 3.3 ) reasonably represents properties of the envelope gas in the vicinity of the cloud , suggesting a physical association between the cloud core and its immediate envelope .",
    "therefore , we proceed with interpretation under the assumption that the core is embedded in the surrounding envelope , but that the envelope is part of a larger structure in the local hierarchy closely associated with the core .    in addition to our hi observations , the uv spectroscopy of ngc  7469 by fsw10 provides rich complementary information about the cloud .",
    "numerous absorption lines have been detected from both low and high ionization species at ms velocities .",
    "fsw10 concluded that neither photoionization nor single - temperature collisional ionization can explain the observed column densities of high ions .",
    "this suggested the existence of highly multi - phase plasma , with a cooler region traced by siiv ( peaking at @xmath178 ) , and a hotter region being traced by ovi ( peaking at @xmath179 ) . on the other hand , the detected low ionization species of oi , cii and siii trace wnm and wim gas with a temperature @xmath180 as does hi .",

    "the velocity dispersions , @xmath91 of the core components are all comparable , but those of the envelope velocity are widely scattered .",

    "although the observed velocity fwhm might suggest a slight increase away from the cloud center , this is not well constrained with our angular resolution .",
    "this dispersion is @xmath203 times higher than what is expected for the wnm / wim gas at @xmath204 and could be interpreted as being due to gas at kinetic temperature @xmath205 with an additional turbulent component .",
    "one possible explanation is that the envelope represents a conduction - dominated ( evaporative ) boundary layer , along the lines of @xcite , in relatively smooth transition from the @xmath206 wnm / wim core to the @xmath207 wim halo .",
    "we do not consider radiative effects on the interface as analyzed by @xcite since the estimated core radius of 147  pc ( table  [ tab : modcloudprop ] ) is well below the critical radiation radius , @xmath208 defined in that analysis as the radius above which radiation effects become significant .",
    "the analysis , based on cooling at solar metallicity yields @xmath209 for an assumed final ( halo ) temperature @xmath210 and density @xmath211 @xcite .",
    "this is already much larger than our estimated cloud radius .",
    "the lower metallicity in this part of the ms of @xmath212 @xcite implies a lower cooling rate .",
    "thus the mean free path in the boundary layer , represented by the scale length @xmath213 , increases ( * ? ?",
    "* equation 7 ) making for an even higher critical radius .",
    "this makes the non - radiative assumption even more comfortable .    interpreting the envelope as single - phase gas in a conduction - dominated boundary layer",
    ", we first estimate the maximum detectable gas temperature that would leave sufficient neutral fraction to produce the observed @xmath214 neutral envelope column density ( table  [ tab : modcloudprop ] ) through a realistic column depth .",

    "so , the observed envelope would have to trace gas no warmer than @xmath218 , with kinetic ( thermal ) dispersion @xmath219 .",
    "given the kinetic component , the turbulent component required to produce the total dispersion would have @xmath220 .",
    "although no conduction - dominated analyses or simulations that we are aware of consider intrinsically turbulent cloud structure , they predict the temperature profiles of static ( evaporative / condensing ) boundary layers . @xcite",
    "considered both classical and saturated heat flux and derived temperature profiles as a function of @xmath221 and the global saturation parameter , @xmath222 . in @xcite figure  1 , these profiles are plotted for a range of @xmath222 values . in our case , we assume @xmath223 and for our estimated maximum envelope temperature , we have @xmath224 where @xmath221 gets only slightly larger than one , regardless of saturation parameter .",
    "this would make the transition to our maximum envelope temperature on order of @xmath225 .",
    "in fact , even if the above detectability analysis is ignored and assuming the envelope dispersion is completely thermal , with corresponding @xmath226 , the transition distance is still only on order of @xmath227 .",
    "this is clearly inconsistent with our extensive detected envelope which reaches a distance of @xmath202 beyond the core .",
    "@xcite performed simulations that included classical and saturated heat flux ( their model r3 ) for a cloud of similar total mass to ours and under ambient temperature and density on the same order as the halo .",
    "although nearly sonic flows and a thin turbulent layer ( @xmath228 of @xmath85 ) developed in these simulations , no systemic turbulence developed nor was it considered .",
    "the initial cloud radius , at @xmath229 , is less than @xmath230 the size of our cloud , but we assume that things roughly scale with radius and ambient temperature as do the derived profiles of @xcite",
    ". a temperature profile is not provided , but if we interpret the density profile of their figure  12 assuming roughly constant pressure , the steep drop in density from @xmath231 to about 10 times that of the ambient halo at @xmath232 suggests the temperature at that point would be @xmath233 for @xmath234 . from this temperature profile ,",
    "our detected envelope gas should extend no further than @xmath235 of core radius ( again assuming that the velocity dispersion is purely thermal ) .",
    "this is much further than the @xcite profiles predict , but still less than an order of magnitude as deep as our observed envelope , which extends as far as @xmath236 of core radius , even after convolution with the gbt beam is taken into account .",
    "@xcite also simulated the cloud with self - gravity ( their model r4 ) and then again with cooling / heating added ( their model r5 ) , with each compressing the transition range further .",
    "we can therefore state that our observed envelope extends further , _ by more than an order of magnitude _",
    ", than simulated or derived results predict for an evaporating cloud without systemic turbulence .",
    "the impact that turbulence throughout our core and envelope would have on these predictions is not known , yet one would expect it to be significant .",
    "however , an order of magnitude increase in the extent of the low temperature range of the boundary layer seems unlikely .      as an alternative interpretation",
    ", the large velocity dispersion of the cloud envelope may be the result of the superposition of multiple , more or less independent clumps of wnm / wim gas turbulently intermixed in the boundary layer with warmer phase gas along the lines of the turbulent mixing layer ( tml ) described in @xcite .",
    "this approach provides a simpler and more supportable explanation for our observations .",
    "in this picture the broad velocity width of the envelope is due to the superposition of discrete clumps of @xmath204 wnm gas ( as found in the cloud core , table  [ tab : modcloudprop ] ) , photoionized by the background and galactic uv radiation , and turbulently dispersed in a mixture with much warmer gas approaching him temperatures with @xmath233 .",
    "the superposition of multiple wnm ( @xmath204 ) clumps , each with @xmath237 turbulently dispersed with @xmath238 will produce an approximate gaussian shape with @xmath239 , similar to the observed total envelope dispersion .",
    "the low metal ion envelope velocity dispersions of table  [ tab : lowionlines ] should also be consistent with this picture .",
    "oi and siii envelope components have comparable dispersion , but are very low compared to hi .",
    "cii has significantly higher dispersion than oi and siii , yet less than hi .",
    "it is important to emphasize that hi is observed with a @xmath3 beam and averaged all around the cloud s vicinity through the spatial averaging we applied , so it would sample a large number of these wnm clumps over a wide range of dispersed velocities . on the other hand , the metal ions",
    "are observed with a `` pencil '' beam through the center of the cloud , passing through a much smaller number of the clumps and having a smaller dispersion .",
    "the larger cii dispersion could be explained by its significantly higher ionization potential allowing it to survive into warmer and more turbulent gas surrounding the wnm clumps .",
    "the tml model , first suggested by @xcite , explains turbulent mixing of cool and hot gas arising from the kh or shear instability induced by the velocity difference across the interface between the two types of gas .",
    "the tml consists of a continuum of phases between the cooler @xmath204 ( wnm / wim ) stripped gas and intermediate temperature gas at @xmath240 ( assuming @xmath241 k ) coexisting in a turbulent mixture . also , since cooling is very efficient at this intermediate temperature , they suggest that some of the ablated gas would rejoin the cooler phase rather than be lost to the hot phase gas , a possible means for slowing the ablation process and extending cloud lifetime .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations of wnm gas clouds passing at supersonic velocities through the him provide further qualitative support to our observations . in simulations ,",
    "wnm clouds consistently develop a hierarchy of smaller clumps peeling off the cloud as a result of kh instability , similar to the picture of wnm / wim clumps we propose @xcite . in the present case ,",
    "our cloud core is probably a very large clump recently separated from the western complex of figure  [ fig : clumpmaps ] as discussed above .",
    "another consistent feature of the simulations is the development of vorticular flow along the shearing interface of the main cloud as well as clumps and protuberances that develop there .",
    "a most striking example are the early evolution simulations shown in figure  2 of @xcite where vortices are fully developed in the non - conductive case and appear to be forming in the more slowly developing conductive case . in the longer - term multi - ion simulations of @xcite",
    "the material is tracked as the developing tml entrains it .",
    "the simulation represented in their figure  2 extend to much larger times and the cloud has properties more like our cloud than the simulations of @xcite or @xcite .",
    "as the gas falls behind the hvc it mixes with the ambient gas producing intermediate temperature gas .",
    "the temperature and velocity structure of the ablated material increases in complexity and range with time . at later times , the simulations indicate a wide @xmath242 to @xmath243 temperature range in the ablated material mixture with @xmath244 of velocity range in the @xmath204 gas near the cloud axis .",
    "this is similar to the observed velocity dispersion of the hi envelope .",
    "also significant , although not easy to discern in figure  2 of @xcite , is the vorticular transport of gas from the mixing layer to the central region where it reverses direction with respect to the entrained gas as discussed by the authors .",
    "they also describe it as a means by which gas cooled in the mixing layer replenishes the cooler gas at the center as suggested by @xcite and mentioned above .",
    "this vorticular motion in the simulations is consistent with our proposed picture of clumps dispersed in both leading and lagging velocities with respect to the cloud in our observed envelope .      the observed hi core component , with its mean line width consistent with @xmath245 , is reasonably interpreted as the neutral component of a central concentration of moderately turbulent wnm to wim supplying cooler gas to the tml after being stripped from its periphery .",
    "the kinetic temperature @xmath246 and turbulent dispersion @xmath247 of the gas can be estimated from the line velocity dispersions , @xmath248 and @xmath249 of two co - spatial species with atomic masses @xmath250 and",
    "@xmath251 by solving the two equations : @xmath252 more than one species could be incorporated by finding an optimum solution for a set of equations for all co - spatial species , of course .",
    "the components of the three metal species at or near the hi core velocity listed in table  [ tab : lowionlines ] should sample a line of sight through the wnm core and the ( photoionized ) wim envelope that probably surrounds it .",
    "however , they may not all be strictly co - spatial",
    ". the density profile of each species can be quite different along the line of sight due to different ionization potentials responding to a decreasing uv flux toward the shielded core center .",
    "hi and oi have the lowest ionizing potentials and so survive mostly toward the center and concentrate there . siii and cii have much higher potentials and , surviving the higher flux in the periphery , are distributed more evenly throughout the core . unless gas along the line of sight has a uniform temperature and turbulent dispersion out to a distance where siii and cii are mostly depleted , these two ions would be biased with respect to hi by sampling gas near the likely warmer and more turbulent periphery near or even into the tml . hi and oi have nearly identical ionization potential which leads to nearly identical ion fraction profiles , sampling points similarly along the line of sight , heavily weighted toward the self - shielded center of the cloud . as a result , we can use hi and oi to separate the thermal and turbulent components and be confident that the result reflects the mean along the line of sight , weighted heavily toward the center of the core and not affected significantly by the tml .    using the velocity dispersion values for hi and oi from table  [ tab : lowionlines ] and solving the above equations yields @xmath253 and turbulent dispersion @xmath254 , both of which are quite consistent with expectations for wnm / wim .",
    "it is interesting to note that if we assume that siii and cii are at this same temperature throughout the core column , their turbulent dispersion components come out to @xmath255 and @xmath256 , respectively .",
    "this is consistent with siii , with its ionization potential higher than hi , surviving further into an increasingly turbulent periphery and cii , with an even higher potential , surviving further still into even higher turbulence as the wnm / wim core transitions to the tml .",
    "our picture of the cloud is of a partially ionized stable wnm / wim core , surrounded by a tml , in which diffuse wnm / wim clumps are dispersed .",
    "these small , dispersed clumps are exposed to not only ionizing extragalactic and galactic radiation , but are also embedded in the ionizing radiation produced locally by the collisional processes in the warmer phases of the tml .",
    "we therefore assume that the clumps are highly ionized and essentially transparent to galactic uv and extragalactic background , which reaches the core at full strength .",
    "we now investigate whether a 3d photoionization model of the cloud core exposed to the galactic and extragalactic uv radiation field can reproduce a neutral component consistent with our core model .",
    "we use a version of the 3d hydrogen - only ionization equilibrium code of @xcite . the code was set up to include a galactic and extragalactic ionizing flux .",
    "a 3d spherical cloud of uniform volume density is discretized onto a linear cartesian grid with 129 cells on a side .",
    "the gas is assumed to be isothermal , with recombination rates based on a kinetic temperature of 8000  k.    the gas can be made clumpy with a fractal - generated density modulation calculated using the algorithm of @xcite ( as described in several papers _",

    "this algorithm leaves a fraction of the gas as the smooth component and redistributes the remaining gas into hierarchical clumps .",

    "we empirically adjusted the @xmath260 and fractal parameters of the algorithm to produce , after ionization , only one distinct neutral structure representing the cloud core ( with some parameter settings , there were two cores ) while still producing distinct substructure .",

    "a density of @xmath263 was assumed which is somewhat higher than that of our core model ( table  [ tab : modcloudprop ] ) , thus allowing for a moderate ion fraction at the center .",

    "the neutral density profile ( figure  [ fig : ionizedcore](b ) ) of the ionized cloud core approximates a composite exponential profile dropping rapidly near the more neutral center and then a longer scale takes over as it becomes more ionized at larger radii .",
    "this is typical of ionization fronts , as in @xcite , where logarithmic plots show three slope regimes , a flat range if the core is fully shielded , followed by a steep region with moderate ionization and then a shallower one with high ionization . since in our example",
    "the core is not fully shielded , there is no flat region .",
    "our crude core model of constant density derived from observations approximates this more realistic density profile as a constant , roughly equal to the central density truncated at about half the full extent of the core , which has a radius of @xmath268 .",
    "this phoionization model also provides information about the neutral fraction of the cloud .",
    "we calculate the neutral fraction from figure  [ fig : ionizedcore](b ) by comparing neutral and ionized hydrogen profiles and find a fraction of @xmath269 along the central los .",
    "this is three times higher than @xmath270 determined by fsw10 based on cloudy simulations for low ions .",
    "fsw10 also determined a lower limit for the incident ionization parameter , @xmath271 .",
    "the equivalent @xmath272 for our example is @xmath273 , a factor of 5 lower . to get the fsw10 value of @xmath272",
    ", our simulations must be at an either unrealistically low or high distance ( @xmath274 or @xmath275 ) to get high enough galactic @xmath276 or low enough @xmath277 , respectively .",
    "realistically , the ionizing flux and therefore @xmath272 would be even lower if partial shielding of the extragalactic flux by the galactic disk and the neighboring western complex were taken into account , increasing the discrepancy . given the insight we now have into the structure along the ngc  7469 sight line , it can be argued that for the core and envelope structure we propose , fsw10 s cloudy analysis overestimates both @xmath272 and the ion fraction for the low ion core environment .",
    "their analysis used the total metal column densities , which include significant metal ion column density from envelope velocity components , as targets for the simulation .",
    "if these absorption components occur in highly ionized wim fragments dispersed in the tml as we propose , their contributions would not be well represented as part of an integral cloudy slab model .",
    "also , higher potential ions like siii and cii would disproportionately sample warmer portions of the ambient collisional mixture .",
    "furthermore , local tml collisional fuv radiation could contribute to the ionization state of the wim fragments , further biasing the modeling results .",
    "it would be interesting to repeat the fsw10 simulations using only the metal column densities associated with the core velocity as targets .",
    "given the high slopes in fsw10 figure  5 ( left ) for the high potential ions , this could result in a significantly lower @xmath272 and ion fraction more in line with our results .",
    "in summary , we showed that we can reproduce the observed hi column density and the rough size of the cloud core relatively easily and with simple assumptions , in the scenario where the core represents the remnant of a larger cloud exposed to galactic and extragalactic background ionizing radiation .",
    "the phoionization exercise also suggests that a large percentage ( @xmath278 in this example ) of the warm phase core of this cloud is ionized .",
    "if we assume that the mixing layer is merely a transport mechanism for the wnm / wim of the cloud to ablate into the halo , we can apply the hydrodynamic ablation equations of @xcite ( pg .",
    "245 ) to estimate the lifetime of the model cloud . in this calculation",
    ", we use the total estimated cloud mass from table  [ tab : modcloudprop ] which includes all warm phase gas ( wnm or wim ) and the lifetime is the time required for all of this warm phase gas to be heated and absorbed into the hot halo .",
    "this lifetime estimate will be on the high side since we are starting with the ablation process well underway with the warm envelope mass already in transition .",
    "it should be noted that our averaging techniques expose a normally undetected envelope whose observed neutral mass is @xmath279 times that of the core , so a very large portion of the mass of this cloud is in the envelope .",
    "this suggests that ablation time calculations based on cloud masses inferred from column densities of conventional hi maps will be quite low since the unobserved envelope may contain the majority of unablated mass .    assuming a distance @xmath280 , the total cloud mass estimate from table  [ tab : modcloudprop ] is @xmath281 .",
    "we assume a peculiar cloud velocity of @xmath282 with respect to a non - rotating halo ( @xmath283 plus some moderate proper motion ) , wnm / wim cloud sound speed @xmath284 , and halo properties @xmath285 , and @xmath286 @xcite on order of typically assumed values .",
    "the flow will be supersonic for these conditions , so we use @xmath287 for a cloud lifetime of @xmath288 .",
    "the infall distance prior to destruction is on order of @xmath289 , not quite surviving to the galactic disk from the assumed distance",
    ". however , mass loss rates could be considerably lower due to factors not accounted for in the above equation such as recycling of wnm / wim gas through rapid cooling @xcite , conduction effects @xcite and magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed long term simulations of clouds with properties on the same order as ours except for an assumption of solar metallicity rather than the 0.1  solar estimate for this cloud @xcite .",
    "their model `` d '' has comparable initial mass and retains 70% of its mass after @xmath290 .",
    "its velocity is less than half that of ours , but the simulations and the authors analysis suggest that once supersonic , flow velocity has a large effect on cloud morphology , but little effect on the mass loss rate .",
    "these models suggest the cloud should have a lifetime as wnm / wim on order of twice that calculated with the @xcite equation , long enough for it to potentially get within reach of the galactic disk .",
    "it should be pointed out that if cooling in the tml indeed slows ablation through recycling as mentioned above , the lower metallicity would reduce the lifetime by some unknown amount .    on the other hand",
    ", @xcite performed 3d simulations of clouds falling through the halo assuming 0.1  solar abundances so cooling effects are appropriate to our cloud .",
    "they directly traced the smaller wnm / wim clump fragments like those that compose our observed envelope .",
    "the cases illustrated are mostly subsonic at all times and clumps generally trail the core mass , but in one of the free - fall simulations shown , it briefly becomes transonic and develops some leading clumps suggesting that vortices are developing as they do in other supersonic simulations like @xcite .",
    "their model `` wb1a15b '' has initial mass @xmath291 and loses @xmath292 of its mass to the halo in @xmath293 ( their figure  3 ) and extrapolating to full mass loss , lasting @xmath294 . to estimate our cloud s lifetime , we start with the integral core mass only ( without the envelope ) as this corresponds to the initial state of the simulations .",
    "we assume that the core will ablate similarly to the simulated cloud independent of a the pre - existing envelope .",
    "our neutral core mass at @xmath26 is @xmath295 ( table  [ tab : modcloudprop ] ) and allowing for @xmath269 ionization as estimated in section  [ sub : discussion : ionization ] , is @xmath296 the mass of the simulated cloud .",
    "the flow is @xmath297 in the simulation and so should ablate at nearly the same rate .",
    "the extrapolated lifetime of our cloud would be on order of @xmath298 , more than twice the @xcite calculation , and easily sufficient to reach the disk with some wnm / wim mass remaining .    in summary , the low - end estimate of cloud survival time as wnm / wim prior to being subsumed by the halo is @xmath299 , insufficient to reach the galactic disk .",
    "this is based on the analysis of @xcite which does not account for cooling or other factors that have been shown to suppress ablation . the numerical results of @xcite which include cooling , suggest that the time to full destruction of warm gas in a similar cloud is much longer , by up to a factor of 2 or more although assumed solar metallicity puts this estimate on the high side . however , rough extrapolation of @xcite simulations , with abundances appropriate to our cloud indicate that , at more than twice the @xcite lifetime , it is possible or even likely that warm gas will reach the disk .",
    "we have obtained deep hi 21  cm emission measurements mapping the vicinity of a relatively isolated , circularly projected cloud in the northern ms and applied a new spatial averaging technique to profile its mean spectrum vs. projected distance from the cloud center . although near a larger cloud complex from which it appears to be separating , the cloud is well defined in angular extent and very well defined in velocity . by exploiting the approximate azimuthal symmetry of the cloud and averaging along successively larger concentric circular paths , we obtained correspondingly increased sensitivity without compromising the essential spatial resolution along the radial dimension . with this method , we detected and characterized core emission having @xmath300 wnm / wim - like fwhm with velocity of @xmath301 and an envelope with broad diffuse emission having @xmath302 fwhm and velocity of @xmath303 extending well beyond the apparent periphery of the cloud s emission .",
    "we then obtained robust estimates of the core and envelope spectral properties by optimally matching the observed , averaged profile to a simple , spherical 3d core - plus - envelope emission model of the cloud projected on to the sky and averaged using the same method .",
    "the envelope probes the neutral component of a boundary layer between the infalling wnm / wim cloud core and the ambient him of the halo . assuming that the broad line width reflects very warm transition gas in a conductive boundary layer",
    ", we estimate the detected extent of the neutral envelope is more than an order of magnitude beyond what should be detectable based on the analyses and simulations of cloud evaporation .",
    "we conclude that a turbulent mixing layer ( tml ) best explains the observed characteristics .",
    "theoretical treatments and numerical simulations in the literature show that a tml has properties that can explain both the envelope line width and leading velocity where the envelope is composed of small clumps of narrower - width wnm / wim dispersed over a large velocity range amidst warmer gas in the tml .",
    "this presents a wide gaussian - like spectrum when a large number or these small clumps are within the beam with some leading and some lagging the core component .",
    "the leading clumps are also explained by the tml where vortices develop near the infalling core when flow is supersonic as expected and demonstrated in various numerical simulations .",
    "passing through the cloud and fortuitously near its center , is the ngc  7469 background source sight line which was characterized by fsw10 using optical and uv absorption data . because oi and hi trace virtually identical profiles weighted toward the center of a partially photoionized cloud , we used measured velocity dispersions from fsw10 s oi and our hi core velocity components to establish a core temperature @xmath253 with a turbulent component @xmath254 , consistent with wnm / wim .",
    "the role of photoionization on the cloud was investigated using a 3d photoionization equilibrium program .",
    "assuming that the collisionally ionized warm tml gas as well as the interspersed wnm / wim clumps are highly ionized , we treated the envelope as transparent to galactic and extragalactic ionizing radiation .",
    "we exposed a clumpy spherical cloud with radius @xmath304 at a distance of @xmath26 with uniform average hydrogen density of @xmath263 to combined galactic and extragalactic ionizing flux based on published values at this distance .",
    "we determined that the centrally concentrated exponential profile of the neutral component is approximated well by our simple uniform neutral density model of @xmath305 the radius .",
    "the core s actual extent as wnm / wim is therefore on order of twice that of our 3d neutral component model .",
    "the neutral fraction along the central los is @xmath269 and the ionization parameter is @xmath273 , quite different from fsw10 s estimates of @xmath270 and @xmath306 , respectively .",
    "we are unable to approach fsw10 s values with any realistic cloud at a realistic distance .",
    "we conjecture that the discrepancy is at least partially due to fsw10 s inclusion of what we suggest are envelope velocity components in abundance calculations .",
    "if produced in the clumpy , warmer and partially collisional envelope environment we propose , these components would not be represented well by cloudy .",
    "the cloud lifetime assuming simple hydrodynamic ablation driven by shear instability in supersonic flow is estimated at @xmath307 , insufficient for any wnm or wim to reach the disk and potentially fuel future star formation . however , a tml is expected to partially suppress ablation through re - cooling of some of the heated gas @xcite .",
    "simulation of a comparable infalling cloud by @xcite which includes cooling indicates a dramatically increased @xmath308 lifetime , suggesting that a large portion of the total mass could reach the disk .",
    "this result is supported by extrapolating the simulations of @xcite .    through our use of the spatial averaging technique",
    ", this work provides the first look ( or more accurately , a peek ) at the structure of the highly ionized and diffuse boundary layer between the warm neutral gas of the ms and the him of the halo from the perspective of the low temperature side of the interface .",
    "fsw10 provides a rich set of data and analysis for the fortuitously aligned ngc  7469 sight line , creating a mini - laboratory to study ms - halo interaction .",
    "we were able to incorporate some of their results to complement ours , but were unable to quantify characteristics of the barely probed tml . to fully exploit this alignment of complementary data , hydrodynamic simulations that emulate the evolution of the larger environment of the cloud ( _ i.e. _ , including the neighboring cloud complex ) would be needed that allow simulated observations on a similar cloud feature .",
    "photoionization would have to be accounted for and its possible impact on the hydrodynamic evolution would have to be addressed .",
    "future work will include applying the technique to isolated circular or filamentary structures ( with or without benefit of well - placed background sources ) in other parts of the ms , both upstream and downstream to see if this apparent mixing layer is common and if its characteristics vary with time , indicated by the location along the ms .",
    "we also plan to obtain higher resolution maps on this cloud and others with the arecibo telescope to complement the lower resolution gbt data and gain insight into the smaller scale structure .",
    "further in the future , we plan to apply the technique to deep , very high resolution observations of such clouds using a large array such as the australian square kilometre array pathfinder ( askap ) .",
