    "the ising model in a transverse field is widely studied for being the simplest system of interacting spins with quantum dynamics .",
    "the most striking feature is that the competition between thermal and quantum fluctuations reduce the critical temperature up to a point when a quantum phase transition occurs at @xmath4 , at a quantum critical point(qcp)@xcite .",
    "we will not discuss here the extensive literature on results for several versions of the model , but we will concentrate instead in the quantum ising spin glass in a transverse field .",
    "this is represented by a hamiltonian in which only one component of the spins , say the z - component , interact among themselves with a random interaction while a uniform , constant field @xmath5 is applied in the transverse x - direction .",
    "the experimental realizations of this model are the @xmath6 compounds@xcite .    in the calculation of the quantum mechanical partition function special tools",
    "are needed to deal with the non - commuting operators forming the hamiltonian .",
    "the method more currently used in the study of short - range @xcite and infinite range @xcite spin glasses in a transverse field is the trotter - suzuki formula @xcite , that maps a system of quantum spins in d - dimensions to a classical system of spins in ( d + 1)-dimensions , and it is suited to perform numerical studies .",
    "another way of dealing with the non - commutativity of quantum mechanical spin operators is to use feynman s path integral formulations @xcite and to introduce time - ordering by means of an imaginary time @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the inverse temperature .",
    "the work by bray and moore@xcite established the basis for recent developments in the theory of the quantum heisenberg spin glass@xcite .    a still different functional integral formulation consists in using grassmann variables to write a field theory with an effective action where the spin operators in the hamiltonian are expressed as bilinear combinations of fermions@xcite .",
    "the advantage of the fermionic formulation is that it has a natural application to problems in condensed matter theory , where the fermion operators represent electrons that also participate in other physical processes , like superconductivity@xcite and the kondo effect@xcite . in the present paper",
    "we use two fermionic models within a grassmannian field theory@xcite to analyze the long range ising spin glass in a transverse field.the novelty resides in the method , as all previous results rely on the trotter - suzuki approximation@xcite . a criticism to the fermionic formulation",
    "may be that the spin eigenstates at each site do not belong to one irreducible representation @xmath9 , but they are labeled instead by the fermionic occupation numbers @xmath10 or 1 , giving two more states with @xmath11 .",
    "we call this the `` four states '' ( 4s ) model , and despite the presence of these two unwanted states the 4s - ising spin glass model describes a spin glass transition with the same characteristics as the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model @xcite in a replica symmetric theory . a way to get rid of the unwanted states",
    "was introduced before by wiethege and sherrington@xcite for non - random interactions and it consists in fixing the occupation number @xmath12 by means of an integral constraint at every site .",
    "we refer to this as the `` two states '' ( 2s)-ising model .    in sect .",
    "2 we analyse the 4s - ising and 2s - ising spin glass models in a transverse field , within the static approximation in a replica symmetric theory .",
    "the static ansatz neglects time fluctuations and may be considered an approximation similar to mean field theory .",
    "numerical monte carlo solutions of bray and moore s equations indicate that the static approximation reproduces the correct results at finite temperatures@xcite .",
    "when @xmath13 the static approximation reproduces the exact results obtained by other methods , in particular for the 2s - ising spin glass model we recover sk equations @xcite .",
    "the results in both models are very similar ; they both exhibit a critical spin glass temperature @xmath2 that decreases when the strength @xmath0 of the transverse field increases , until it reaches a quantum critical point(qcp ) at @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "the value of @xmath3 is the same for both models and the 4s - ising and 2s - ising models are identical close to the qcp .",
    "we obtained for both models that the replica symmetric solution is unstable @xcite in the whole spin glass phase , in agreement with previous results with the trotter - suzuki method@xcite .",
    "we left sect . 3 for discussions .",
    "the ising spin glass in a transverse field is represented by the hamiltonian    @xmath16    where the sum is over the n sites of a lattice and @xmath17 is a random coupling among all pairs of spins , with gaussian probability distribution :    @xmath18    the spin operators are represented by auxiliary fermions fields : @xmath19\\nonumber\\\\ s^{x}_{i}=\\frac{1}{2}[a_{i \\uparrow}^{\\dagger}a_{i \\downarrow } +   a_{i \\downarrow}^{\\dagger}a_{i \\uparrow } ] \\label{2.3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath20 are creation ( destruction ) operators with fermion anticommutatiom rules and @xmath21 or@xmath22 indicates the spin projections .",
    "the number operators @xmath23 or 1 , then @xmath1 in eq.([2.3 ] ) has two eigenvalues @xmath24 corresponding to @xmath25 , and two vanishing eigenvalues when @xmath26 .",
    "we shall use the lagrangian path integral formulation in terms of anticommuting grassmann fields described in previous publications @xcite , so we avoid giving repetitious details .",
    "we consider two models : the unrestrained , four states model that has been used previously @xcite , and also the two states model of wiethege and sherrington where the number operators satisfy the restraint @xmath27 , what gives @xmath28 , at every site @xcite    the partition function in the 4s - model is given by    @xmath29    while in the restrained model it takes the form : @xmath30 \\label{2.5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the inverse temperature .    by using the integral representation for the kronecker @xmath32-function : @xmath33 } \\label{2.6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can express @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the compact functional integral form @xmath36 where : @xmath37-\\nonumber \\\\          & & h(\\varphi_{j \\sigma}^{\\ast}(\\tau),\\varphi_{j \\sigma}(\\tau)\\ } \\label{2.8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath38 for the 4s - model while @xmath39 for the 2s - model .",
    "going to fourier representation we introduce the spinors : @xmath40 and the pauli matrices : @xmath41 to write the spin glass part of the action @xmath42 where @xmath43 with matsubara s frequencias @xmath44 and @xmath45 . in the static approximation ,",
    "we retain just the term @xmath46 in the sum over the frequency @xmath47 .",

    "we are now able to follow the standard procedures to get the configurational averaged free energy per site by using the replica formalism : @xmath52 where the configurational averaged , replicated , partition function @xmath53 becomes , after averanging over @xmath17 :    @xmath54    with the replica index @xmath55 , and @xmath56 \\label{2.18}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we indicate by @xmath57 the static component @xmath58 of eq.([2.12 ] ) .",

    "we then obtain for the model with @xmath75 states , @xmath76 or @xmath77 :    @xmath78-   \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}dz \\log [ 2 k_{p}(q,\\bar{\\chi},z ) ] \\label{2.28}\\ ] ]    where @xmath79 the saddle point equations for the order parameters are : @xmath80 @xmath81 where @xmath82 is given in eq.([2.23 ] ) .",

    "the critical temperature is obtained by solving simultaneously : @xmath92 the numerical results for the critical temperature @xmath2 and the entropy @xmath93 are shown in fig . 1 for the 4s - model and fig . 2 for the 2s - model .",
