    "the physical content of general relativity is contained in einstein s equation , which has a well - posed initial value formulation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in principle , therefore , to determine the motion of bodies in general relativity  such as binary neutron stars or black holes ",
    "one simply needs to provide appropriate initial data ( satisfying the constraint equations ) on a spacelike slice and then evolve this data via einstein s equation .",
    "however , in practice , it is generally impossible to find exact solutions of physical interest describing the motion of bodies by analytic methods .",
    "although it now is possible to find solutions numerically in many cases of interest , it is difficult and cumbersome to do so , and one may overlook subtle effects and/or remain unenlightened about some basic general features of the solutions . therefore , it is of considerable interest to develop methods that yield approximate descriptions of motion in some cases of interest .",
    "in general , the motion of a body of finite size will depend on the details of its composition as well as the details of its internal states of motion .",
    "therefore , one can expect to get a simple description of motion only in some kind of `` point particle limit '' .",
    "however , einstein s equation is nonlinear , and a straightforward analysis @xcite shows that it does not make any mathematical sense to consider solutions of einstein s equation with a distributional stress - energy tensor supported on a worldline .",
    "physically , if one tried to shrink a body down to zero radius at fixed mass , collapse to a black hole would occur before the point particle limit could be reached .",
    "distributional stress - energy tensors supported on a world - line _ do _ make mathematical sense in the context of the linearized einstein equation .",
    "therefore , one might begin a treatment of gravitational self - force by considering a metric perturbation , @xmath3 , in a background metric , @xmath4 , sourced by the stress - energy tensor of a `` point particle '' of mass m , given in coordinates @xmath5 by @xmath6(t , x^i ) = 8 \\pi m u_a(t ) u_b(t ) \\frac{\\delta^{(3)}(x^i    - z^i(t))}{\\sqrt{-g } } \\frac{d\\tau}{dt}\\,\\ , .\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the unit tangent ( i.e. , 4-velocity ) of the worldline @xmath8 defined by @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the proper time along @xmath8 .",
    "( here @xmath11 is the `` coordinate delta function '' , i.e. , @xmath12 . the right side also could be written covariantly as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the covariant 4-dimensional delta - function and @xmath10 denotes the proper time along @xmath8 . )",
    "however , this approach presents two major difficulties .",
    "first , the linearized bianchi identity implies that the point particle stress - energy must be conserved .",
    "however , as we shall see explicitly in section [ sec : geodesic ] below , this requires that the worldline @xmath8 of the particle be a geodesic of the background spacetime",
    ". therefore , there are no solutions to equation for non - geodesic source curves , making it hopeless to use this equation to derive corrections to geodesic motion .",
    "this difficulty has been circumvented in @xcite and other references by modifying as follows .",
    "choose the lorenz gauge condition , so that equation takes the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "equation by itself has solutions for any source curve @xmath8 ; it is only when the lorenz gauge condition is adjoined that the equations are equivalent to the linearized einstein equation and geodesic motion is enforced .",
    "therefore , if one solves the lorenz - gauge form of the linearized einstein equation while simply _ ignoring _ the lorenz gauge condition ) truly is ignored in the sense that it is not even pointed out that one has modified the linearized einstein equation , and no attempt is made to justify this modification . ] that was used to derive , one allows for the possibility non - geodesic motion .",
    "of course , this `` gauge relaxation '' of the linearized einstein equation produces an equation inequivalent to the original .",
    "however , because deviations from geodesic motion are expected to be small , the lorenz gauge violation should likewise be small , and it thus has been argued @xcite that solutions to the two systems should agree to sufficient accuracy .",
    "the second difficulty is that the solutions to eq .",
    "( [ eq : wave ] ) are singular on the worldine of the particle . therefore ,",
    "naive attempts to compute corrections to the motion due to @xmath3such as demanding that the particle move on a geodesic of @xmath18are virtually certain to encounter severe mathematical difficulties , analogous to the difficulties encountered in treatments of the electromagnetic self - force problem .    despite these difficulties",
    ", there is a general consensus that in the approximation that spin and higher multipole moments may be neglected , the motion of a sufficiently small body ( with no `` incoming radiation '' ) should be described by self consistently solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : wave ] ) via the retarded solution together with @xmath19 where @xmath20 with @xmath21 the retarded green s function for eq .",
    "( [ eq : wave ] ) , normalized with a factor of @xmath22 , following @xcite .",
    "the symbol @xmath23 indicates that the range of the integral extends just short of the retarded time @xmath24 , so that only the `` tail '' ( i.e. , interior of the light cone ) portion of the green s function is used ( see , e.g. , reference @xcite for details ) .",
    "equations ( [ eq : wave ] ) and ( [ eq : misataquwa - intro ] ) are known as the misataquwa equations , and have been derived by a variety of approaches . however , there are difficulties with all of these approaches .",
    "one approach @xcite that has been taken is to parallel the analysis of @xcite in the electromagnetic case and use conservation of effective gravitational stress - energy to determine the motion .",
    "however , this use of distributional sources at second - order in perturbation theory results in infinities that must be `` regularized '' .",
    "although these regularization procedures are relatively natural - looking , the mathematical status of such a derivation is unclear .",
    "another approach @xcite is to postulate certain properties that equations of gravitational self - force should satisfy .",
    "this yields a mathematically clean derivation of the self - force corrected equations of motion .",
    "however , as the authors of @xcite emphasized , the motion of bodies in general relativity is fully described by einstein s equation together with the field equations of the matter sources , so no additional postulates should be needed to obtain an equation of motion , beyond the `` small body '' assumption and other such approximations .",
    "the analysis given by @xcite shows that equation follows from certain plausible assumptions . however , their derivation is thus only a plausibility argument for equation .",
    "similar remarks apply to a later derivation by poisson @xcite that uses a green s function decomposition developed by detweiler and whiting @xcite .    a third approach , taken by mino , sasaki , and tanaka @xcite and later poisson @xcite  building on previous work of burke @xcite , death @xcite , kates @xcite , thorne and hartle @xcite , and others  involves the use of matched astymptotic expansions .",
    "here one assumes a metric form in the `` near zone''where the metric is assumed to be that of the body , with a small correction due to the background spacetime  and in the `` far zone''where the metric is assumed to be that of the background spacetime , with a small correction due to the body .",
    "one then assumes that there is an overlap region of the body where both metric forms apply , and matches the expressions .",
    "the equations of motion of the body then arise from the matching conditions .",
    "however , as we shall indicate below , in addition to the `` lorenz gauge relaxation '' , there are a number of assumptions and steps in these derivations that have not been adequately justified .    a more rigorous approach to deriving gravitational self - force",
    "is suggested by the work of geroch and jang @xcite and later geroch and ehlers @xcite on geodesic motion of small bodies ( see also @xcite ) . in @xcite ,",
    "one considers a fixed spacetime background metric @xmath4 and considers a smooth one - parameter family of stress - energy smooth tensors @xmath25 that satisfy the dominant energy condition and have support on a world tube . as the parameter goes to zero , the world tube shrinks to a timelike curve .",
    "it is then proven that this timelike curve must be a geodesic .",
    "this result was generalized in @xcite to allow @xmath4 to also vary with @xmath2 so that einstein s equation is satisfied . within the framework of @xcite , it therefore should be possible to derive perturbative corrections to geodesic motion , including gravitational self - force .",
    "however , the conditions imposed in @xcite in effect require the mass of the body to go to zero faster than @xmath26 . consequently , in this approach , a self - force correction like to the motion of the body would arise at higher order than finite size effects and possibly other effects that would depend on the composition of the body .",
    "thus , while the work of @xcite provides a rigorous derivation of geodesic motion of a `` small body '' to lowest order , it is not a promising approach to derive gravitatational self - force corrections to geodesic motion .    in this paper",
    ", we shall take an approach similar in spirit to that of @xcite , but we will consider a different smooth , one - parameter family of metrics @xmath0 , wherein , in effect , we have a body ( or black hole ) present that scales to zero size in a self - similar manner , with both the size and the mass of the body being proportional to @xmath2 . in the limit as @xmath27 , the body ( or black hole ) shrinks down to a worldline , @xmath8 . as in @xcite and @xcite , we prove that @xmath8 must be a geodesic of the `` background spacetime '' @xmath28although our method of proving this differs significantly from @xcite and @xcite . to first order in @xmath2 , the correction to the motion",
    "is described by a vector field , @xmath29 , on @xmath8 , which gives the `` infinitesimal displacement '' to the new worldline .",
    "we will show that , for any such one parameter family @xmath0 , in the lorenz gauge @xmath30 satisfies @xmath31    here @xmath32 and @xmath33 are , respectively , the mass and spin of the body .",
    "the terms in parentheses on the right side of this equation correspond exactly to the gravitational self - force term in eq . ; the first term is the papapetrou spin - force @xcite ; the second term is simply the usual right hand side of the geodesic deviation equation .",
    "equation is `` universal '' in the sense that it holds for any one - parameter family satisfying our assumptions , so it holds equally well for a ( sufficiently small ) blob of ordinary matter or a ( sufficiently small ) black hole .",
    "our derivation of is closely related to the matched asymptotic expansions analyses . however , our derivation is a rigorous , perturbative result .",
    "in addition , we eliminate a number of ad hoc , unjustified , and/or unnecssary assumptions made in previous approaches , including assumptions about the form of the `` body metric '' and its perturbations , assumptions about rate of change of these quantities with time , the imposition of certain gauge conditions , the imposition of boundary conditions at the body , and , most importantly , the step of lorenz gauge relaxation . furthermore , in our approach , the notion of a `` point particle '' is a concept that is _ derived _ rather than assumed .",
    "it also will be manifest in our approach that the results hold for all bodies ( or black holes ) and that the physical results do not depend on a choice of gauge ( although @xmath30 itself is a gauge dependent quantity , i.e. , the description of the corrections to particle motion depend on how the spacetimes at different @xmath2 are identified  see section [ sec : dipole ] and appendix a ) .",
    "in particular , because the lorenz gauge plays no preferred role in our derivation ( aside from being a computationally convenient choice ) , our gauge transformation law is not , as in previous work @xcite , restricted to gauges continuously related to the lorenz gauge .",
    "our approach also holds out the possibility of being extended so as to systematically take higher order corrections into account .",
    "however , we shall not attempt to undertake such an extension in this paper .",
    "although holds rigorously as a first - order perturbative correction to geodesic motion , this equation would not be expected to provide a good global - in - time approximation to motion , since the small local corrections to the motion given by may accumulate with time , and eq .   would not be expected to provide a good description of the perturbed motion when @xmath29 becomes large .",
    "we will argue in this paper that the misataquwa equations , eqs .   and , should provide a much better global - in - time approximation to motion than eq .",
    ", and they therefore should be used for self - consistent calculations of the motion of a small body , such as for calculations of extreme - mass - ratio inspiral .",
    "we note in passing that , in contrast to einstein s equation , maxwell s equations are linear , and it makes perfectly good mathematical sense to consider distributional solutions to maxwell s equations with point particle sources .",
    "however , if the charge - current sources are not specified in advance but rather are determined by solving the matter equations of motion  which are assumed to be such that the total stress - energy of the matter and electromagnetic field is conserved  then the full , coupled system of maxwell s equations together with the equations of motion of the sources becomes nonlinear in the the electromagnetic field .",
    "point particle sources do not make mathematical sense in this context either .",
    "it is for this reason that  despite more than a century of work on this problem  there is no mathematically legitimate derivation of the electromagnetic self - force on a charged particle .",
    "the methods of this paper can be used to rigorously derive a perturbative expression for electromagnetic self - force by considering suitable one - parameter families of coupled electromagnetic - matter systems , and we shall carry out this analysis elsewhere @xcite . however , we shall restrict consideration in this paper to the gravitational case .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "example ] , we motivate the kind of one - parameter family of metrics , @xmath34 , that we will consider by examining the one - parameter family of schwarzschild - desitter spacetimes with black hole mass equal to @xmath2 . one way of taking the limit as @xmath35 yields desitter spacetime .",
    "we refer to this way of taking the limit as the `` ordinary limit '' .",
    "but we show that if we take the limit as @xmath35 in another way and also rescale the metric by @xmath36 , we obtain schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "we refer to this second way of taking the limit as @xmath35 as the `` scaled limit '' .",
    "the scaled limit can be taken at any time @xmath37 on the worldline @xmath8 .",
    "the simultaneous existence of both types of limits defines the kind of one parameter family of metrics we seek , wherein a body ( or black hole ) is shrinking down to a world - line @xmath8 in an asymptotically self - similar manner .",
    "the precise , general conditions we impose on @xmath0 are formulated in section [ sec : example ] .",
    "some basic properties of @xmath0 that follow directly from our assumptions are given in section [ sec : assumptions ] .",
    "in particular , we obtain general `` far zone '' and `` near zone '' expansions and we show that , at any @xmath37 , the scaled limit always yields a stationary , asymptotically flat spacetime at @xmath38 . in section [ sec : geodesic ] , we prove that @xmath8 must be a geodesic of the `` background spacetime '' ( i.e. , the spacetime at @xmath38 resulting from taking the ordinary limit ) .",
    "in other words , to zeroth order in @xmath2 a small body or black hole always moves on a geodesic .",
    "we also show that , to first order in @xmath2 , the metric perturbation associated with such a body or black hole corresponds to that of a structureless `` point particle '' . in section [ sec : dipole ] , we define the motion of the body ( or black hole ) to first order in @xmath2 by finding a coordinate displacement that makes the mass dipole moment of the stationary , asymptotically flat spacetime appearing in the scaled limit vanish .",
    "( this can be interpreted as a displacement to the `` center of mass '' of the body . ) in section [ sec : calculation ] , we then derive eq . as the first order in @xmath2 correction to @xmath8 in the lorenz gauge .",
    "( an appendix provides the transformation to other gauges . ) finally , in section [ sec : beyond ] we explain the status of the misataquwa equation .",
    "our spacetime conventions are those of wald @xcite , and we work in units where @xmath39 .",
    "lower case latin indices early in the alphabet ( @xmath40 ) will denote abstract spacetime indices ; greek indices will denote coordinate components of these tensors ; latin indices from mid - alphabet ( @xmath41 ) will denote spatial coordinate components .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , we seek a one - parameter family of metrics @xmath42 that describes a material body or black hole that `` shrinks down to zero size '' in an asymptotically self - similar manner . in order to motivate the general conditions on @xmath42 that we shall impose , we consider here an extremely simple example of the type of one - parameter family that we seek .",
    "this example will provide an illustration of the two types of limits that we shall use to characterize @xmath42 .",
    "our example is built from schwarzschild - desitter spacetime , @xmath43 ( this metric , of course , is a solution to the vacuum einstein s equation with a cosmological constant @xmath44 rather than a solution with @xmath45 , but the field equations will not play any role in the considerations of this section ; we prefer to use this example because of its simplicity and familiarity . ) the desired one - parameter family is @xmath46 where we consider only the portion of the spacetime with @xmath47 for some @xmath48 . for each @xmath2",
    ", this spacetime describes the exterior gravitational field of a spherical body or black hole of mass @xmath49 in an asymptotically desitter spacetime . as @xmath35 ,",
    "the body / black hole shrinks to zero size and mass . for @xmath38 ,",
    "the spacetime is desitter spacetime , which extends smoothly to the worldline @xmath50 , corresponding to where the body / black hole was just before it `` disappeared '' .",
    "as explained clearly in @xcite , the limit of a one - parameter family of metrics @xmath42 depends on how the spacetime manifolds at different values of @xmath2 are identified .",
    "this identification of spacetime manifolds at different @xmath2 can be specified by choosing coordinates @xmath51 for each @xmath2 and identifying points labeled by the same value of the coordinates @xmath51 .",
    "if we use the coordinates @xmath52 in which the one - parameter family of metrics was presented to do the identification , then it is obvious that the limit as @xmath35 of @xmath42 is the desitter metric @xmath53 this corresponds to the view that the body / black hole shrinks to zero size and mass and `` disappears '' as @xmath35 .",
    "however , there is another way of taking the limit of @xmath42 as @xmath35 ; the existence of this second limit is one of the key ideas in this paper .",
    "choose an arbitrary time @xmath37 and , for @xmath54 , introduce new time and radial coordinates by @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "in the new coordinates , the one - parameter family of metrics becomes @xmath57 we now consider the limit as @xmath35 by identifying the spacetimes with different @xmath2 at the same values of the barred coordinates .",
    "it is clear by inspection of eq.([gbar ] ) that the the limit of @xmath42 as @xmath35 at fixed @xmath58 exists , but is zero .",
    "in essence , the spacetime interval between any two events labeled by @xmath59 and @xmath60 goes to zero as @xmath35 because these events are converging to the same point on @xmath8 .",
    "thus , this limit of @xmath42 exists but is not very interesting .",
    "however , an interesting limit can be taken by considering a new one - parameter family of metrics @xmath61 by @xmath62 so that @xmath63 by inspection , the limit of this family of metrics is simply , @xmath64 which is just the schwarzschild metric with mass @xmath65 .",
    "the meaning of this second limit can be understood as follows . as already discussed above",
    ", the one - parameter family of metrics ( [ eq : family ] ) describes the exterior gravitational field of a spherical body or black hole that shrinks to zero size and mass as @xmath35 .",
    "the second limit corresponds to how this family of spacetimes looks to the family of observers placed at the events labeled by fixed values of @xmath58 . in going from , say , the @xmath66 to the @xmath67 spacetime",
    ", each observer will see that the body / black hole has shrunk in size and mass by a factor of @xmath68 and each observer also will find himself `` closer to the origin '' by this same factor of @xmath68 .",
    "suppose now that this family of observers also `` changes units '' by this same factor of @xmath68 , i.e. , they use centimeters rather than meters to measure distances .",
    "then , except for small effects due to the desitter background , the family of observers for the @xmath67 spacetime will report the same results ( expressed in centimeters ) as the observers for the @xmath66 spacetime had reported ( in meters ) . in the limit as @xmath35 ,",
    "these observers simply see a schwarzschild black hole of mass @xmath65 , since the effects of the desitter background on what these observers will report disappear entirely in this limit .",
    "we will refer to the first type of limit ( i.e. , the limit as @xmath35 of @xmath42 taken at fixed @xmath51 ) as the _ ordinary limit _ of @xmath42 , and we will refer to the second limit ( i.e. , the limit as @xmath35 of @xmath69 taken at fixed @xmath58 ) as the _ scaled limit _ of @xmath42 .",
    "the simultaneous existence of both types of the above limits contains a great deal of relevant information about the one - parameter family of spacetimes ( [ eq : family ] ) .",
    "in essence , the existence of the first type of limit is telling us that the body / black hole is shrinking down to a worldline @xmath8 , with its mass going to zero ( at least ) as rapidly as its radius .",
    "the existence of the second type of limit is telling us that the body / black hole is shrinking to zero size in an asymptotically self - similar manner : in particular , its mass is proportional to its size , its shape is not changing , and it is not undergoing any ( high frequency ) oscillations in time . figure [ fig:2limits - spacetime ] illustrates the two limits we consider .    , the body shrinks and finally disappears , leaving behind a smooth background spacetime with a preferred world - line , @xmath8 , picked out .",
    "the solid lines illustrate this `` ordinary limit '' of @xmath35 at fixed @xmath70 , which is taken along paths that terminate away from @xmath8 ( i.e. , @xmath71 ) .",
    "by contrast , the `` scaled limit '' as @xmath35 , shown in dashed lines , is taken along paths at fixed @xmath72 that converge to a point on @xmath8.,width=288 ]    we wish now to abstract from the above example the general conditions to impose upon one - parameter families that express in a simple and precise way the condition that we have an arbitrary body ( or black hole ) that is shrinking to zero size  in an asymptotically self - similar way  in an arbitrary background spacetime .",
    "most of the remainder of this paper will be devoted to obtaining `` equations of motion '' for these bodies that are accurate enough to include gravitational self - force effects .",
    "a first attempt at specifying the type of one - parameter families @xmath42 that we seek is as follows :    * \\(i ) _ existence of the `` ordinary limit '' _ :",
    "@xmath42 is such that there exists coordinates @xmath73 such that @xmath74 is jointly smooth in @xmath75 , at least for @xmath76 for some constant @xmath77 , where @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) . for all @xmath2 and for @xmath76",
    ", @xmath42 is a vacuum solution of einstein s equation .",
    "furthermore , @xmath80 is smooth in @xmath73 , including at @xmath81 , and , for @xmath82 , the curve @xmath8 defined by @xmath81 is timelike .",
    "* \\(ii ) _ existence of the `` scaled limit '' _ : for each @xmath37 , we define @xmath55 , @xmath83 .",
    "then the metric @xmath84 is jointly smooth in @xmath85 for @xmath86 .",
    "here we have used the notation @xmath87 to denote the components of @xmath4 in the @xmath88 coordinates , whereas @xmath89 denotes the components of @xmath90 in the @xmath88 coordinates .",
    "it should be noted that , since the barred coordinates differ only by scale ( and shift of time origin ) from the corresponding unbarred coordinates , we have @xmath91 consequently ,",
    "we have @xmath92 since there is a cancelation of the factors of @xmath2 resulting from the definition of @xmath90 and the coordinate rescalings .",
    "it also should be noted that there is a redundancy in our description of the one - parameter family of metrics when taking the scaled limit : we define a scaled limit for all values of @xmath37 , but these arise from a single one - parameter family of metrics @xmath42 .",
    "indeed , it is not difficult to see that we have @xmath93    in fact , our requirements on @xmath4 of the existence of both an `` ordinary limit '' and a `` scaled limit '' are not quite strong enough to properly specify the one - parameter families we seek .",
    "to explain this and obtain the desired strengthened condition , it is convenient to define the new variables @xmath94 where the range of @xmath95 is @xmath96 . let @xmath97 denote a component of @xmath42 in the coordinates @xmath73 .",
    "however , instead of viewing @xmath97 as a function of @xmath98 , we view @xmath97 as a function of @xmath99 , where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are defined in terms of @xmath102 by the usual formula for spherical polar angles . in terms of these new variables , taking the `` ordinary limit ''",
    "corresponds to letting @xmath103 at any fixed @xmath104 , whereas taking the `` scaled limit '' corresponds to letting @xmath105 at any fixed @xmath106 ( see figure [ fig:2limits - ab ] ) .",
    "now , our assumptions concerning the ordinary limit imply that , at fixed @xmath107 and at fixed @xmath108 , @xmath97 depends smoothly on @xmath95 , including at @xmath109 . on the other hand , our assumptions concerning the scaled limit",
    "imply that at fixed @xmath107 and at fixed @xmath106 , @xmath97 is smooth in @xmath110 .",
    "furthermore , the last condition in the ordinary limit implies that for @xmath109 and fixed @xmath107 , @xmath97 is smooth in @xmath110 , including at @xmath111 .",
    "thus , at fixed @xmath107 , our previously stated assumptions imply that @xmath97 is well defined at the `` origin '' @xmath112 , and is smooth in @xmath110 along the @xmath110-axis ( i.e. , @xmath109 ) . however , our previously stated assumptions do not say anything about the continuity or smoothness of @xmath97 as @xmath113 from directions other than along the @xmath110-axis .",
    "such limiting behavior would correspond to letting @xmath114 as @xmath35 but at a rate _",
    "slower _ than @xmath2 , i.e. , such that @xmath115 . to see the meaning and relevance of this limiting behavior ,",
    "let us return to our original motivating example , eq .",
    "( [ eq : family ] ) and take @xmath97 to be the time - time component of this metric to `` cartesian - like '' coordinates @xmath102 that are well behaved at the origin @xmath116 when @xmath38 ] . in terms of our new variables ( [ alphabeta ] )",
    ", we have @xmath118 which is jointly smooth in @xmath119 at @xmath120 . by contrast , suppose we had a one - parameter family of metrics @xmath121 that satisfies our above assumptions about the ordinary and scaled limits , but fails to be jointly smooth in @xmath119 at @xmath120 .",
    "for example , suppose the time - time component of such a one - parameter family varied as @xmath122 in terms of the original variables @xmath123 , this corresponds to behavior of the form @xmath124 if we take the `` ordinary limit '' ( @xmath35 at fixed @xmath71 ) of @xmath125 , we find that @xmath125 smoothly goes to @xmath126 .",
    "similarly , if we take the `` scaled limit '' ( @xmath127 at fixed @xmath128 ) , we also find that @xmath125 smoothly goes to @xmath126 .",
    "however , suppose we let @xmath35 but let @xmath70 go to zero as @xmath129 .",
    "then @xmath125 will approach a different limit , namely @xmath130 .",
    "in essence , @xmath131 corresponds to a one - parameter family in which there is a `` bump of curvature '' at @xmath132 .",
    "although this `` bump of curvature '' does not register when one takes the ordinary or scaled limits , it is present in the one - parameter family of spacetimes and represents unacceptable limiting behavior as @xmath35 of this one - parameter family .    in order to eliminate this kind of non - uniform behavior in @xmath2 and @xmath70",
    ", we now impose the following addtional condition :    * \\(iii ) _ uniformity condition _ :",
    "each component of @xmath42 in the coordinates @xmath51 is a jointly smooth function of the variables @xmath133 at @xmath120 ( at fixed @xmath134 ) , where @xmath110 and @xmath95 are defined by eq.([alphabeta ] ) .",
    "assumptions ( i)-(iii ) constitute all of the conditions that we shall impose on @xmath42 .",

    "in this section , we derive some immediate consequences of the assumptions of the previous section that will play a key role in our analysis .",
    "these results will follow directly from the `` uniformity condition '' and the consistency relation ( [ consist ] ) .    since , by the uniformity assumption , the coordinate components of the one - parameter family of metrics @xmath42 are jointly smooth in the variables @xmath119 at @xmath120 , we may approximate @xmath144 by a joint taylor series in @xmath110 and @xmath95 to any finite orders @xmath145 and @xmath32 by @xmath146 substituting for @xmath110 and @xmath95 from eq.([alphabeta ] ) , we have @xmath147 where here and in the following , we drop the error term",

    "however , arbitrarily high positive powers of @xmath70 may occur at each order in @xmath2 .",

    "however , our `` near zone expansion '' differs in that we define a separate expansion for each time @xmath37 rather than attempting a uniform in time approximation with a single expansion .",
    "such expansions require an additional `` quasi - static '' or slow - time variation assumption for the evolution of the metric perturbations .",
    "a further difference is that the conclusion that the background ( @xmath38 ) metric is stationary and asymptotically flat has been derived here rather than assumed . indeed , in other analyses , a particular form of the background metric ( such as the schwarzschild metric ) is assumed , and the possibility that this metric form might change with time ( i.e. , depend upon @xmath37 ) is not considered .",

    "in the previous section , we established that , to zeroth order in @xmath2 , any body ( or black hole ) of nonvanishing mass moves on a geodesic of the background spacetime .",
    "much of the remainder of this paper will be devoted to finding the corrections to this motion , valid to first order in @xmath2 in the far zone . in this section",
    ", we address the issue of what is meant by the `` motion of the body '' to first order in @xmath2 .",
    "the first point that should be clearly recognized is that it is far from obvious how to describe `` motion '' in terms of a worldline for @xmath54 .",
    "indeed , the metric @xmath42 is defined only for @xmath188 , so at finite @xmath2 the spacetime metric may not even be defined in a neighborhood of @xmath8 .",
    "if we were to assume that @xmath245 and that the region @xmath246 were `` filled in '' with sufficiently `` weak field matter''so that @xmath247 , where @xmath248 denotes the supremum of the components of the riemann curvature tensor of @xmath61 in the `` filled in '' region  then it should be possible to define a `` center of mass '' worldline at finite @xmath2 , and we could use this worldline to characterize the motion of the body @xcite . however , we do not wish to make any `` weak field '' assumptions here , since we wish to describe to motion of small black holes and other `` strong field '' objects .",
    "since it is not clear how to associate a worldline to the body at finite @xmath2and , indeed , the `` body '' is excluded from the spacetime region we consider at finite @xmath2it is not clear what one would mean by a `` perturbative correction '' to @xmath8 to first or higher order in @xmath2 .",
    "a second point that should be understood is that if we have succeeded in defining the worldlines describing the motion the body at finite @xmath2 , @xmath249 then the `` first order in @xmath2 perturbative correction '' , @xmath29 , to the zeroth order motion @xmath8 ( given by @xmath250 ) is most properly viewed as the spatial components of a vector field , @xmath251 , defined along @xmath8 .",
    "this vector field describes the `` infinitesimal displacement '' to the corrected motion to first order in @xmath2 .",
    "the time component , @xmath252 , of @xmath251 depends on on how we identify the time parameter of the worldlines at different values of @xmath2 and is not physically relevant ; we will set @xmath253 so that @xmath251 is orthogonal to the tangent , @xmath7 , to @xmath8 in the background metric @xmath176 .",
    "thus , when we seek equations of motion describing the first order perturbative corrections to geodesic motion , we are seeking equations satisfied by the vector field @xmath254 on @xmath8 .",
    "a third point that should be clearly recognized is that @xmath251 and any equations of motion satisfied by @xmath251 will depend on our choice of gauge for @xmath3 . to see this explicitly ,",
    "suppose that we perform a smooth is not smooth at @xmath116 are also permitted under the coordinate freedom stated at the end of section [ sec : example ] .",
    "however , it suffices to consider smooth @xmath255 for our consderations here .",
    "the change in the description of motion under non - smooth gauge transformations will be treated in appendix a. ] gauge transformation of the form @xmath256 under this gauge transformation , we have @xmath257 however , clearly , the new description of motion will be of the form @xcite @xmath258 where @xmath259 thus , we see that @xmath251 transforms as @xmath260 in order that it describe the same perturbed motion . thus , the first order correction , @xmath254 , to the background geodesic motion contains no meaningful information by itself and , indeed , it can always be set to zero by a smooth gauge transformation . only the pair @xmath261 has gauge invariant meaning .",
    "we turn now to the definition of the first order perturbed motion .",
    "our definition relies on the fact , proven in section [ sec : assumptions ] above , that for each @xmath37 , @xmath262 is a stationary , asymptotically flat spacetime .",
    "therefore , @xmath164 has well defined sets of mass ( `` electric parity '' ) and angular momentum ( `` magnetic parity '' ) multipole moments @xcite and , indeed , the spacetime is characterized by the values of these two sets of multipole moments @xcite .",
    "the multipole moments ( other than the lowest nonvanishing multipoles of each type ) depend upon a choice of conformal factor @xcite , which , rougly speaking , corresponds to a choice of `` origin '' .",

    "it is well known that if the mass is nonzero , the mass dipole moment is `` pure gauge '' and can be set to zero by choice of conformal factor/``origin '' .",
    "we now explicitly show that , with our choice of conformal factor @xmath263 , the mass dipole moment can be set to zero by a smooth gauge transformation of the form ( [ eq : transform ] ) .",

    "( [ ptparticle ] ) ) is also the komar / adm mass of the stationary , asymptotically flat spacetime @xmath276 .",

    "it can be seen that this transformation have the effect of changing the mass dipole moment by @xmath280 . in particular",
    ", we can always choose @xmath281 so as to set the mass dipole moment to zero .",
    "now , the `` near zone '' coordinates @xmath282 for which the mass dipole moment vanishes have the interpretation of being `` body centered '' coordinates to zeroth order in @xmath2 .",
    "the origin @xmath283 of the corresponding `` far zone '' coordinates @xmath284 therefore has the interpretation of representing the `` position '' of the center of mass of the body to first order in @xmath2 .",

    "what is of interest is any `` universal relations '' satisfied by @xmath254 that are independent of the choice of one - parameter family satisfying assumptions ( i)-(iii ) of section [ sec : example ] . such universal relations would provide us with `` laws of motion '' for point particles that take self - force effects into account . in the next section , we will show ( via a lengthy calculation ) that such a universal relation exists for @xmath289 , thus providing us with general `` equations of motion '' for all `` point particles '' , valid to first order in @xmath2 .",
    "finally , we note that if we wish to describe motion beyond first order in @xmath2 , it will be necessary to define a `` representative world line '' in the far zone to at least second order in @xmath2 .",

    "when @xmath82 , we find that the energy , @xmath459 , does not change with time , and the body will remain in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath460 for all time . when we do first order perturbation theory in @xmath2 , we will find that the first order in @xmath2 correction , @xmath461 , to the energy satisfies becomes small compared to the typical wavelengths of the radiation ( as it must as we let @xmath462 ) , we enter a physical optics regime where our formulas are no longer valid .",
    "we ignore such effects here , just as in our above analysis of the motion of bodies in general relativity we ignored quantum gravity effects even though they should be important when the size of the body is smaller than the planck scale . ]",
    "@xmath463 where @xmath464 is the stefan - boltzmann constant and @xmath465 .",
    "note that only the zeroth order temperature , @xmath460 , enters the right side of this equation because the quantity @xmath466 is already first order in @xmath2 , so the effect of any changes in temperature would appear only to higher order in @xmath2 . since @xmath460 is a constant , it is easy to integrate eq .",
    "( [ de ] ) to obtain , @xmath467 thus , first order perturbation theory approximates the behavior of @xmath468 as @xmath469 although this is a good approximation at early times , it is a horrible approximation at late times , as it predicts that the energy will go negative .",
    "if one went to second order in perturbation theory , one would obtain corrections to eq .",
    "( [ de ] ) that would take into account the first order energy loss as well as various non - equilibrium effects . however , one would still be perturbing off of the non - radiating background , and the late time predictions using second ( or any finite higher order ) perturbation theory would still be very poor .",
    "however , there is an obvious major improvement that can be obtained by noting that if @xmath456 is sufficiently small , then the body should remain nearly in thermal equilibrium as it loses energy .",
    "therefore , although perturbation theory off of the zeroth order solution may give poor results at late times , first order perturbation theory off of _ some _ thermal equilibrium solution should give locally accurate results at all times .",
    "this suggests that if @xmath456 is sufficiently small , the cooling of the body should be described by @xmath470 when supplemented with the formula , @xmath471 , that relates energy to temperature when the body is in thermal equilibrium , this equation should provide an excellent description of the cooling of the body that is valid at all times . in effect , eq .",
    "( [ denew ] ) takes into account the higher order perturbative effects ( to all orders in @xmath2 ) associated with the cooling of the body , but it neglects various perturbative effects associated with the body failing to remain in thermal equilibrium as it cools . equation ( [ denew ] ) is _ not _ an exact equation ( since it does not take various non - equilibrium effects into account ) and it is _ not _ an equation that arises directly from perturbation theory .",

    "such equations are commonly written down for systems that can be described _ locally in time _ by a small deviation from a simple solution .",
    "how does one find a `` self - consistent perturbative equation '' for a given system for which one has derived first order perturbative equations ?",
    "we do not believe that there is any general method for deriving a self - consistent perturbative equation .",
    "however , the following appear to be appropriate criteria to impose on a self - consistent perturbative equation : ( 1 ) it should have a well posed initial value formulation .",
    "( 2 ) it should have the same number of degrees of freedom as the first order perturbative system , so that a correspondence can be made between initial data for the self - consistent perturbative equation and the first order perturbative system .",
    "( 3 ) for corresponding initial data , the solutions to the self - consistent perturbative equation should be close to the corresponding solutions of the first order perturbative system over the time interval for which the first order perturbative description should be accurate .",
    "we do not know of any reason why , for any given system , there need exist a self - consistent perturbative equation satisfying these criteria . in cases",
    "where a self - consistent perturbative equation satisfying these criteria does exist , we would not expect it to be unique .",
    "for example , we could modify eq .",
    "( [ denew ] ) by adding suitable terms proportional to @xmath472 to the right side of this equation .",
    "the first order perturbative equations for the motion of a small body are that the first order metric perturbation satisfies @xmath473 where @xmath116 corresponds to a geodesic , @xmath8 of the background spacetime , and @xmath7 is the tangent to @xmath8 .",
    "if we consider the retarded solution to this equation ( which automatically satisfies the lorenz gauge condition ) , we have proven rigorously in this paper that the first order in @xmath2 deviation of the motion from @xmath8 satisfies @xmath474 with @xmath475 where , for simplicity , we have dropped the spin term .",
    "the misataquwa equations",

    ", @xmath478 ( normalized in the background metric ) refers to the self - consistent motion @xmath479 , rather than to a background geodesic as before .",
    "although a proper mathematical analysis of this integro - differential system has not been carried out , it appears plausible that our above criteria ( 1)-(3 ) will be satisfied by the misataquwa equations .",
    "if so , they should provide a good , global in time , description of motion for problems like extreme mass ratio inspiral .",
    "we wish to thank abraham harte and eric poisson for helpful discussions .",
    "this research was supported in part by nsf grant phy04 - 56619 to the university of chicago and a national science foundation graduate research fellowship to sg .",
    "as discussed in section [ sec : dipole ] , the description of motion will change under first - order changes of gauge .",
    "indeed , in that section , we noted that under a smooth gauge transformation , the description of motion changes by eq .",
    "( [ smoothgauge ] ) . however , as previously stated near the end of section [ sec : example ] above ( see equation ) , the allowed coordinate freedom includes transformations that are not smooth at @xmath50 . since such gauges may arise in practice singularity along a string @xcite , and therefore do not satisfy our assumptions . ] , we provide here the expression for the first order perturbative equation of motion in an arbitrary gauge allowed by our assumptions .",
    "we also present the corresponding self - consistent perturbative equations of motion .    as previously noted in section [ sec : calculation ] ( see the remark below eq .",
    "( [ jh ] ) ) , the equations of motion to first order in @xmath2 depend only upon the first order gauge transformation @xmath480 .",
    "as we have seen , the mass dipole moment appears at second - order in ( far zone ) perturbation theory , so we must consider the effects of first - order gauge transformations on second - order perturbations .",
    "this is given by @xmath481 , with @xmath482 where @xmath483 denotes the lie derivative .",
    "equivalently , we have @xmath484 where @xmath191 is the derivative operator associated with the background metric @xmath171 . in order to satisfy the criteria on allowed gauge transformations ( see equation )",
    ", the components of @xmath480 must be of the form @xmath485 i.e. , @xmath480 can not `` blow up '' at @xmath50 but it can be singular in the sense that its components can have direction - dependent limits .",
    "the mass dipole moment , @xmath373 , is one - half of the coefficient of the @xmath383 part of the leading order , @xmath310 , part of the second order metric perturbation , @xmath486 .",
    "therefore , @xmath373 may be extracted from the formula , @xmath487 where ds is the area element on the sphere of radius @xmath488 . under the gauge transformation generated by @xmath480",
    ", we have @xmath489 as previously noted , for an arbitrary first - order perturbation satisfying our assumptions , we have @xmath490 where @xmath32 is the mass of the body . from eqs .",
    "( [ xiform ] ) , ( [ dg200 ] ) and ( [ g100 ] ) , we see that the change in @xmath486 induced by our gauge transformation is @xmath491 therefore , by eq .",
    "( [ eq : app - dip ] ) , the induced change in the mass dipole moment is @xmath492 where @xmath493 is the area element on the unit sphere .    equation ( [ dp ] ) gives the change in the mass dipole moment induced by the possibly non - smooth gauge transformation generated by @xmath480 .",
    "the corresponding change in the first order perturbative equation of motion is determined by the change in the _ smooth _ vector field @xmath494 required to eliminate the mass dipole .",
    "writing @xmath495 , this change is given by @xmath496 ( see eq . ) .",
    "thus , the change @xmath497 induced in the deviation vector describing the perturbed worldline is @xmath498 with @xmath499 given by eq .  .",
    "in the case where our original gauge was the lorenz gauge , it follows immediately from eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom ] ) that the new equation of motion for @xmath500 is @xmath501 where @xmath502 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : gauge - law ] ) , and where , for simplicity , we have dropped the spin term .",
    "we may rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom - app2 ] ) as @xmath503 note that although eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom - app6 ] ) provides us with the desired equation of motion in an arbitrary allowed gauge , the terms involving components of @xmath504 must still be computed in the lorenz gauge .",
    "now suppose one wishes to pass to a self - consistent perturbative equation associated with the new choice of gauge .",
    "it is not obvious how one might wish to modify the evolution equations for the metric perturbations in the new gauge .",
    "( one possibility would be to simply use eq .",
    "( [ misa2 ] ) and then modify the result by the addition of @xmath505 but it might be preferable to find a new equation based on a suitable `` relaxed '' version of the linearized einstein equation for the new gauge . )",
    "however , it appears that a natural choice of self - consistent perturbative equation associated to eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom - app6 ] ) would be @xmath506 in the case where @xmath480 is smooth ( so that , by eq .  (",
