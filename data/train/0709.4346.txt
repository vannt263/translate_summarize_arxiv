    "the behavior of vortex matter in superconductors can to a large degree be controlled by introducing artificial defects .",
    "it has been known for a long time that randomly distributed defects , created e.g. by neutron irradiation , allow a dramatic enhancement of the critical current density , @xmath3 .",
    "one may reach more specific goals by tuning the arrangement of artificial defects .",
    "in particular , experiments on superconducting thin films have revealed a large number of interesting effects , including matching effects,@xcite noise reduction in squids,@xcite rectified vortex motion,@xcite anisotropy of @xmath3,@xcite and vortex guidance.@xcite    in parallel with the experimental progress , the theoretical understanding of how artificially created patterns interact with vortex matter is also developing .",
    "interaction between a single vortex and a cylindrical cavity in a bulk superconductor was considered within the london approximation in ref .  .",
    "this work extends the classical paper , ref .  , predicting the maximal number of flux quanta that can be trapped by a single hole .",
    "current distribution around a 1d array of holes was calculated within the ginsburg - landau theory in ref .  .",
    "however , these theoretical works consider a _ bulk _ superconductor , while most experiments are on patterned _ thin films_.@xcite moreover , a realistic model should take into account the strong pinning of vortices in the superconducting areas around the artificial defects .",
    "when the defect size is much larger than the london penetration depth , one can consider the average vortex density @xmath4 rather than individual vortices .",
    "such an approach was used in ref .   to simulate flux penetration into a thin film with a 2d array of holes .",
    "it allowed to explain an asymmetrical flux penetration due to asymmetry in the hole shape . at the same time , the case of an individual hole in a thin film has not yet been carefully analysed .",
    "a main purpose of the present work is to acquire details of flux and current distributions in a superconducting strip with one individual hole .",
    "an approximate picture of the current distribution around a non - conducting hole can be obtained within bean s critical state model.@xcite in the bean model current stream lines are added from the edge with equal spacing representing the critical current density .",
    "the presence of a hole forces the current to flow around it and hence pushes the flux front deeper into the sample .",
    "both holes and sample corners give rise to so - called @xmath5-lines where the current changes direction discontinuously.@xcite they are seen as dark lines@xcite in images showing magnetic flux distributions.@xcite for example , 90@xmath6  corners give 45@xmath6  straight @xmath5-lines@xcite while semicircular indentations of the edge give parabolic @xmath5-lines.@xcite the magneto - optical image of fig .",
    "[ fig : mo - hole ] shows @xmath5-lines spreading out from a circular hole towards the flux - free region .",
    "the same hole also introduces another pattern : a darkened region starting from the hole and extending _ towards the edge_. this pattern is similar to the one observed by eisenmenger et al . , ref .  .",
    "the pattern does not fit with the common interpretation of the bean model , which leaves the the currents between the hole and the edge unperturbed .",
    "ref .   discusses how to reinterpret the bean model and explain the observed pattern as a second parabolic @xmath5-line . in this work",
    ", we will go further and do full dynamical simulations of flux penetration taking into account the non - local electrodynamics of films as well as flux creep .",
    "our results provide details of flux and current distributions in the vicinity of a hole and suggest a new interpretation for the observed anomaly .",
    "consider a type - ii superconducting thin film placed in an increasing transverse magnetic field .",
    "the superconductor responds by generating screening currents to shield its interior .",
    "the current density is highest at the edges where the lorentz force eventually overcomes the pinning force , leading to penetration of flux .",
    "according to the bean model , the vortices move only when the local current density exceeds the critical value , @xmath3 .",
    "a more realistic model for flux penetration also allows for flux creep at @xmath7 .",
    "macroscopically , flux creep is introduced through a highly non - linear current voltage relation@xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is electric field , @xmath10 a resistivity constant , @xmath11 is current density , and @xmath12 is the creep exponent . for thin films of yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 ,",
    "@xmath12 is typically in the range from 10 to 70 depending on temperature and pinning strength.@xcite    [ fig : sample ]    flux dynamics of single - connected type - ii superconductors in transverse geometry has been described thoroughly by e.  h.  brandt .",
    "this work uses the same formalism and hence we only give a short summary of the simulation basics , mainly following refs .   and .",
    "the next section will be devoted to additional changes for multiply - connected samples .    for films ,",
    "it is a great simplification to work with the sheet current @xmath13 , @xmath14 , in stead of the current density @xmath11 .",

    "[ material - law ] .",
    "the right - hand side of eq .   is expressed only via @xmath32 and @xmath20 so that time evolution of @xmath32 can be found by integrating the equation numerically .    [",
    "fig : b - half ]      for macroscopic , arbitrarily shaped , single - connected , type - ii superconducting films flux dynamics is fully described by eq .  .",
    "this basic equation can also be used for multiply connected samples , but in this case one needs to specify the dynamically changing value of @xmath32 at the hole boundary . in refs .   and this value was set to the lowest value of @xmath32 along the hole perimeter .",
    "this method turned out to be quite feasible but unfortunately it can not reproduce the discussed pattern of fig .  [",
    "fig : mo - hole ] .",
    "moreover , it also introduces unphysical net flux into the hole before the flux front has reached it .",
    "a completely different approach is to consider the holes as part of the sample , but ascribe to them a large ohmic resistance or a strongly reduced @xmath38.@xcite then , eq",
    ".   applies to the whole sample including the holes , while the material law , eqs .   and , is spatially non - uniform .",
    "this approach is physically justified but numerically challenging due to huge electric field gradients .",
    "in addition , there still remain small but non - zero currents flowing within the holes .    in this work",
    "we propose a new approach that does not require any additional assumptions , though requires a larger computational time . in this approach the integration in eq .",
    "is extended over the whole sample area including the holes .",

    "here we presented @xmath35 as a sum @xmath40 where @xmath41 is nonzero only in the hole and @xmath42 is nonzero within the superconducting areas .",
    "@xmath42 is calculated in the straightforward way using eq .  .",
    "the other term , @xmath41 , is defined by two conditions .",
    "the first condition is that current does not flow beyond the superconducting areas , i.e. , @xmath43 is constant within the hole .",
    "this constant is determined by the second condition , that the total change of magnetic flux inside the hole is related to the electric field at its boundary through faraday s law , @xmath44    in order to find a @xmath41 that satisfies the two conditions we use an iteration scheme .",
    "an initial guess , @xmath45 , is substituted into eq .   to find @xmath46 inside the hole .",
    "the next approximation is found as @xmath47 where the constant @xmath48 is chosen so that eq .",
    "is satisfied .",
    "@xmath49 is then inserted into eq .   to find @xmath50 .",
    "this @xmath50 is in general non - uniform , but when the procedure is repeated @xmath51 becomes more uniform with every new iteration .",
    "a smart choice of the initial guess of @xmath45 is the final value at the previous time step , @xmath52 . with this choice only a couple of iterations",
    "are sufficient .",
    "note that the scheme presented here is in no way bound to the discrete formulation of the kernel , eq .  .",
    "it can be used for any formulation as long as both the forward and inverse relations between @xmath43 and @xmath35 are known .",
    "further mathematical details are in appendix  [ sec : numerics ] .",
    "[ fig : h - slices ] [ fig : j - slices ]",
    "in this section , eq .   is solved for an infinite superconducting strip in linearly increasing magnetic field .",
    "the strip is modeled using periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath53-direction , and examples of magnetic field distributions are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : b - half ] . in the upper part one observes regular flux penetration with maximum of @xmath54 at the edges .",
    "flux penetration in the lower half is strongly affected by the presence a small , circular , non - conducting hole .",
    "note that the flux distribution is perturbed in a region that significantly exceeds the hole dimensions .    the left image of fig .",
    "[ fig : b - half ] corresponds to a small field for which the flux front has not reached the hole yet . in this case",
    "the hole shows up as a field dipole , in agreement with magneto - optical observations ; cf . refs .   and .",
    "namely , there is positive field at the farther side of the hole and a negative field at the side closer to the film edge .",
    "the negative fields shrinks when the flux front reaches the hole , but the asymmetry of the flux distribution inside the hole remains , as seen in the right image .",
    "as expected , the front becomes distorted so that the penetration is significantly deeper in the vicinity of the hole .",
    "for the full penetration image of fig .",
    "[ fig : b - full ] one also clearly see the @xmath5-lines as dark line originating at the hole and directed towards the middle of the strip .",
    "such @xmath5-lines were first described in ref .   within the bean model framework and they are called @xmath5-lines because current changes direction discontinuously there .",
    "the discontinuity is most clearly seen in current stream line plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : j - stream ]  ( left ) . for the bean model , @xmath5-lines from circular holes",
    "are parabolic and by convention @xmath5-lines from small holes inside superconductors are often called parabolas . in the presence of flux",
    "creep the change of current direction is smeared as follows from fig .",
    "[ fig : j - stream ]  ( right ) .",
    "however , the @xmath5-lines are still clearly visible , at least for @xmath55 .    comparing the two panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : j - stream ] we notice a qualitative difference between the current flow in the bulk bean model and for films under the creep . in the bean model the current density is everywhere constant and all the current that is blocked by the hole turns towards the strip center .",
    "the region between the hole and the edge is hence unaffected by the presence of the hole . for film",
    "creep dynamics this is no longer true and a certain fraction of the current will force its way here . as a result ,",
    "the current density is enhanced which is seen as denser stream lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : j - stream ]  ( right ) .",
    "since the stream lines bend they create the feature visible in the flux distribution of fig .",
    "[ fig : b - half ] : a slightly darkened region starting at the hole and widening towards the edge .",
    "this feature can also be observed experimentally ; cf .",
    "[ fig : mo - hole ] .",
    "it was analysed in detail in ref .   and interpreted in terms of the bean model as additional parabolic d - lines .",
    "our experiment and simulations suggest a different interpretation .",
    "we believe that one should speak about an _ area _ of reduced flux density rather than new d - lines .",
    "moreover , the appearance of this area is due to _ locally enhanced _ current density , hence it can not be explained within the bean model , postulating @xmath56 .",
    "an enhanced current density also implies a strongly enhanced electric field .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : strip - jhe ] showing the contour lines of @xmath57 .",
    "a locally enhanced @xmath57 means that there is an exceptionally intensive traffic of magnetic flux through the channel between the edge and the hole .",
    "the channel width is approximately given by the hole diameter , but increases slightly towards the edge .",
    "the width depends in general on the distance to the edge and the creep exponent @xmath12 . both larger distance and smaller @xmath12",
    "tend to make the channel wider .",
    "after arrival to the hole , the flux is further directed in the fan - shaped region between the d - lines .",
    "electric field within this region is also relatively high , again implying an intensive flux traffic .",
    "this situation is similar to the case of a semicircular indentation at the sample edge considered in refs .  , , and .",
    "the hole thus strongly rearranges trajectories of flux flow .",
    "the above discussion is further confirmed by profiles of @xmath54 , @xmath58 , @xmath32 , and @xmath57 through the line @xmath59 shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : strip - slices ] .",
    "the @xmath58 profiles show features commonly observed in strips,@xcite i.e. , plateaus with values @xmath60 in the penetrated regions and shielding currents with @xmath61 in the meissner regions .",
    "the profiles show clearly the enhanced @xmath58 and @xmath57 between the edge and the hole .",
    "it is also interesting to see the negative @xmath54 for low values and how the negative values gradually vanish when the main flux front gets in contact .",
    "[ fig : flux - hole ] shows the total flux in a circular hole , @xmath62 , as a function of the applied field @xmath20 for various distances between the hole and the edge . in the beginning , @xmath63 , until the main flux front is in contact with the hole .",
    "then it starts to increase . for high fields @xmath64 grows almost linearly with @xmath20 at a universal growth rate determined by the hole area .",
    "the linear rate is not just the case for small holes in strips , but has also been found for e.g. ring geometry.@xcite note that for small fields @xmath64 is close to , but not exactly zero .",
    "the reason is the creation of two additional flux fronts : one positive towards the flux - free region and one negative towards the edge , as also seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : strip - slices ] .",
    "only when integrating @xmath54 over a larger area that includes this additional penetration one finds that the total flux is exactly zero.@xcite this integral is also a good consistency check of the boundary condition implementation , since a wrong value of @xmath65 tends to introduce a net , unphysical flux in the hole .",
    "this section presents results of simulations of a square superconducting film with rectangular slits .",
    "the sample geometry is chosen to reassemble one particular yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath66 film and comparison of the simulation with a magneto - optical image of the sample is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : slits ] .",
    "the experimental film thickness is @xmath67  nm , and side lengths are @xmath68  mm .",
    "the two slits have been cut out with a laser .",
    "details of the film preparation can be found elsewhere.@xcite    the experiment and simulations show a great similarity both in large and in the details .",
    "the flux density is considerably enhanced everywhere along the slit edges , and reaches the maximal values at the upper corners .",
    "our main result found for circular holes holds true also for rectangular slits .",
    "namely , we again find a distinct dark region starting at the slit and widening towards the edge .",
    "it can be attributed to the over - critical current density in that region , which is clearly seen in the current stream - line plot .",
    "a new result for slits is a slightly brightened regions near the upper corners that appear due to concave current turns .",
    "a similar situation arises in superconductors of some other shapes having concave corners , e.g. in crosses.@xcite    there also exist a few minor discrepancies between flux distributions obtained in the simulations and in the experiment of fig .  [",
    "fig : slits ] .",
    "the most notable is the details of the region of reduced @xmath54 at the side of slits close to the edge .",
    "the values of @xmath54 appear to be less in the simulation than in experiment .",
    "this might be caused by simplifications , like the disregarded @xmath4-dependency of the material law or the simplification of using the sheet current in stead of the true current density .",
    "we have proposed a new method for treating boundary conditions of non - conducting holes inside macroscopic , type - ii superconducting films .",
    "the key point is to reconstruct the at first unknown @xmath35 inside the holes , at each time step of the simulation .",
    "the method is capable of handling any number of holes of arbitrary shape .",
    "the simulations of flux dynamics assuming a material law @xmath69 reproduce very well flux distributions observed by magneto - optical imaging in yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 films , for circular holes as well as rectangular slits . in particular , they demonstrate a significant enhancement of current density in the region between a hole ( slit ) and the edge leading to a more intensive traffic of flux . this region appears darker in magneto - optical images due to a slight bending of current stream lines .",
    "we thank c.  romero - salazar and ch .",
    "jooss for fruitful discussions and m.  baziljevich for experimental data on fig  [ fig : slits ] .",
    "this work was supported financially by the norwegian research council , grant no .",
    "158518/431 ( nanomat ) and by funmat@uio .",
    "the simulations are run on a @xmath70 square grid .",
    "the creep exponent and the ramp rate are @xmath71 and @xmath72 , a regime in which creep is low , but not negligible . changing @xmath12",
    "would only do quantitative changes to the results . for small exponents the plateaus of current profiles , like fig .",
    "[ fig : j - slices ] , would be less flat and there would also be more current compressed between the holes and the edge .",
    "the main limiting factor of the simulations is memory consumption since the kernel matrix @xmath22 , eq .  , has dimension @xmath73 .",
    "the simulations are run with @xmath74 grid points , which yields a kernel matrix of dimension @xmath75 , when the sample symmetry has been exploited.@xcite    the kernel @xmath22 in eq .",
    "depends explicitly on the sample shape .",
    "since the strip is infinite in the @xmath53-direction , @xmath22 should be computed via an infinite sum over strip segments .",
    "however a good approximation is achieved with only one segment on each side of the `` main '' strip .",
    "the strip segments further away contain zero net current and the dipole like character means that they have a negligible effect .",
    "a good accuracy of this approximation was checked by comparing the meissner state width , @xmath76 , obtained for very high @xmath12 with the analytical film bean - model result,@xcite @xmath77 .",
    "the reconstruction of @xmath35 inside the hole , eq .  , need not use the full @xmath22 from eq .  .",
    "the best is to use a smaller kernel , @xmath78 , also generated with eq .  , but only including points inside the hole .",
    "fast convergence of eq .",
    "is achieve by ignoring currents at the hole perimeter , which means that @xmath78 should use @xmath79 .",
    "the most difficult numerical problem in our method is the calculation of the electric field at the boundary in eq .  .",
    "the electric field is given by the power law , eq .  , and is largely fluctuating between neighboring grid points .",
    "a stable way to handle this is to take the average of only the most significant values of @xmath57 and use @xmath80 and @xmath81 for the hole circumference and area ."
