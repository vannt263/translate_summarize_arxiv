    "protostars generally consist of young stars surrounded by disks , infalling envelopes and outflows . in low - mass protostars , the central star or stars do not reach the main sequence until well after the envelope and most of the disk has dispersed , whereas high - mass protostars may already be undergoing core hydrogen burning during the early envelope accretion stage .",
    "recent high - spatial resolution , multi - wavelength and time - resolved observations have revealed three - dimensional structures in disks such as warps , spiral density patterns , gaps , and misaligned inner disks that can confirm and challenge theories of planet formation @xcite .",
    "observations of protostellar envelopes hope to determine , among other things , the dynamics of early collapse , including how quickly disks form and fragment , and how outflows interact with the infalling envelopes and eventually disperse them @xcite . because low - mass protostars are more numerous and have longer timescales than high - mass , their evolutionary timescales are reasonably well - understood , though it is of great interest to know how these timescales ( e.g. , disk survival lifetimes ) vary in different environments . for high - mass protostars , it is of interest to learn more about their evolutionary timescales : how long - lived are their disks , and do they form planets ?    thus even though we have had an explosion of sensitive infrared imaging , photometry , and spectroscopy of protostars from e.g. , the _",
    "space telescope , hubble space telescope , herschel space observatory , and several ground - based observatories , we still have many interesting science questions to explore with these datasets .",
    "we developed a 2-d dust radiation transfer code for protostars in anticipation of the _ spitzer _ space telescope data ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* papers i , ii , & iii , respectively ) . these were used to classify evolutionary stages on many large datasets ( for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "other groups have also developed publicly available radiation transfer codes suited for protostars @xcite .",
    "data provided by several observatories have revealed geometric structures and physical processes that were not included in our earlier codes : polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecule and very small grain ( vsg ) emission , external illumination by the interstellar radiation field , and 3-d structures .",
    "this paper describes our new modifications and initial results using the code , called hochunk3d .",
    " 2 describes the numerical improvements and  3 describes the physics enhancements with initial results using the code . ",
    "4 concludes with a summary of the results using the new code .",
    "the code described in paper i solves the radiation transfer equation for any material in radiative equilibrium , in axisymmetric geometries illuminated by a central source .",
    "the geometry incorporated into the code to model protostars and t tauri stars includes an accretion disk @xcite , infalling envelope @xcite , and bipolar outflow cavity .",
    "the analytic formulae used to describe these geometries are given in paper i. papers ii , iii , and @xcite illustrate how the code can be used to model a range of evolutionary stages .",
    "here we give a brief description of some numerical improvements to the code , and then in  [ physics ] describe the physics enhancements and scientific results .",
    "the hochunk3d code has been converted to fortran 95 , which allows a specification of 1-d , 2-d , or 3-d grids at runtime .",
    "the code is parallelized so it can be run on multiple processors on one machine , or on multiple machines in a network . as in previous versions ,",
    "the code outputs spectral energy distributions ( seds ) at a number of viewing angles ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) specified in the input file . an optional raytracing algorithm ( called `` peeling - off '' ) produces a high signal - to - noise sed and broadband images in a specified direction ; this has been expanded to allow multiple viewing angles .",
    "a set of broadband filter functions is included in the code .",
    "the instructions manual describes how to add new filters .",
    "movies and light curves can be made for a sequence of viewing angles .",
    "the images have intensity units of mjy / sr",
    ". the output can be formatted in ascii and unformatted fortran files as before , or in fits format .",
    "fits output uses much less disk space and is not machine dependent .",
    "if the fits output is specified , there is an option to create an image cube where the third dimension is wavelength .",
    "thus a movie can be made as a wavelength sequence .",
    "plotting programs for examining input and output are available with the program distribution , including ones that convolve images with instrumental resolution .",
    "the images presented in this paper are 299x299 pixels with no convolution of instrumental point - spread - functions .",
    "our code distribution includes all of the models presented in this paper as examples .",
    "certain features are not included in our latest distribution because they may are easily implemented in the new radiation transfer code , hyperion , developed by @xcite .",
    "these include multiple stellar sources ( both finite - size and point - source ) .",
    "the hyperion code includes the option for various grids : cartesian , spherical - polar , cylindrical , and adaptive cartesian ( octree and adaptive mesh refinement ) .",
    "the cartesian and adaptive cartesian are probably better suited for incorporating density grids from dynamical simulations .",
    "another advance in the hyperion code is the use of raytracing to produce higher signal - to - noise at the longest wavelengths . finally , the hyperion code has 3-d diffusion in the dense regions of the axisymmetric disk , whereas hochunk3d is using 1-d diffusion in either the radial or polar direction depending on the grid cell location .",
    "hyperion uses a python interface for generating input and output .",
    "hochunk3d uses text input , and the supplied plotting programs use idl .",
    "we tested the code as each new feature was implemented .",
    "we have developed three independent versions of our codes , including the hyperion code @xcite , and tested between them .",
    "the hyperion code has been benchmarked with other codes as well @xcite .",
    "our code now includes two options for temperature correction : the @xcite method corrects the temperature and emission spectrum in each grid cell as photons are absorbed , and does not require iteration .",
    "the @xcite method very efficiently calculates temperature by summing photon path lengths instead of absorptions in a grid cell .",
    "photons are re - emitted immediately , as in @xcite but the temperature of the grid cell is not updated until an iteration of the simulation is complete .",
    "the temperature usually converges in a short number of iterations ( 3 - 5 is typical ) ; this efficiency is due to the fact that flux is conserved exactly across all surfaces @xcite .",
    "the two temperature algorithms give identical results ( within noise ) .",
    "@xcite summarizes in more detail the differences between these methods and the relative efficiencies in different situations . in short ,",
    "their relative efficiencies depend on the number of grid cells and the optical depth in the grid . in 3-d simulations with many grid cells , fewer photons",
    "are absorbed per grid cell so it takes more photons to calculate an accurate temperature than to compute a clean output spectrum .",
    "the lucy method is more efficient here because the number of photons that simply pass through a grid cell is orders of magnitude larger than the number that are absorbed . in the 2-d simulations we have set up for protostars , the two methods have similar efficiencies .",
    "our default is to use the lucy method , since it has similar run - times , and since iteration is required for both the pah / vsg emission (  [ s_pah ] ) and the vertical hydrostatical equilibrium solution (  [ s_hseq ] ) .",
    "the grids are spherical - polar ( @xmath2 ) as in previous versions .",
    "the temperature and density grids now have an added dimension ( in addition to the 3 spatial dimensions ) , which allows for multiple dust species .",
    "the code is set up currently for 8 different dust types to be distributed in various or all locations ; this number can be expanded arbitrarily to incorporate , for example , different grain sizes or species .",
    "this makes it easy to implement a simplified version of dust stratification , which leads to larger grains in the midplane than the upper layers @xcite .",
    "previously we allowed for different grain models in different regions of the disk , with a larger - grain model in the high - density regions .",
    "now we allow for two disks ( and the envelope ) to co - exist , each with different grain properties .",
    "the user can specify the geometry of each disk ; for example , making the one with the larger grains have a flatter profile to mimic dust stratification .",
    "table [ t_dust ] shows the 8 different dust types , their locations in the protostar , and the dust files we use .",
    "new dust models with format compatible with our code can be computed using a publicly available code .",
    "figure [ f_sed_modcii ] shows a comparison of a t tauri star + disk model with the one in paper ii ( the class ii model in figure 3b ) .",
    "the model parameters are chosen to be typical for a low mass t tauri star : @xmath3k , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6yr .",
    "disk accretion contributes an additional 0.03 @xmath7 bringing the total luminosity to 1.03 @xmath7 .",
    "this disk accretion rate is lower than the one used in paper ii ( @xmath8yr ) .",
    "this shows in the shortest wavelengths , where the paper ii model has higher ultraviolet flux .",
    "we do not expect an exact match to the sed in paper ii because , as stated above , we now use two dust disks with different scale heights overlaid on each other rather than having the dust separated into 2 regions of a single disk . to account for the effect of dust stratification",
    ", the disk with larger grains has half the scale height as the disk with smaller grains .",
    "the plotted fluxes assume a distance to the source of 140 pc .",
    "figure [ f_sed4t_modcii ] shows different emission components of the sed from this disk model : total , thermal , stellar / hotspot , and scattered .",
    "this provides insight into , for example , at what wavelengths scattering , direct stellar , or thermal can dominate the emission .",
    "note that the scattering bump at long wavelengths is due to the large grains in the disk which have a significant scattering albedo at long wavelengths .",
    "figure [ f_sed4o_modcii ] shows different origins of the outgoing photons : total , stellar , disk and envelope . while all of the photons originally came from the star or disk accretion ( or external illumination if that option is chosen ) , if they were absorbed and re - emitted , the origin refers to the place in which the final re - emission took place",
    ". we have re - run the 6 models from paper ii , with the parameters tuned to get good agreement with the seds in paper ii .",
    "note that these are not meant to be best - estimate parameters of various evolutionary stages , but are just examples .",
    "polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) are large molecules . both these and very small grains ( vsgs ) are not in thermal equilibrium with the radiation field ; however , their emissivities can be computed based on the specific energy , @xmath9 , absorbed in each grid cell . following @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite",
    ", we use pre - computed emissivity tables for several different values of specific energy . in the monte carlo method",
    ", a photon has an interaction when a randomly sampled optical depth is reached ( computed based on the opacity of the medium ) ; the particular interaction is then sampled based on the relative probabilities of each , which is directly related to their opacities .",
    "the pah / vsg emission is simply another interaction like scattering or thermal emission .",
    "the pah / vsg photon is emitted from the emissivity spectrum , based on the specific energy of the radiation field .",
    "this method requires iteration to determine @xmath9 in each grid cell ; however , we are already iterating for the temperature calculation , so the pah calculation adds no noticeable additional cpu time .",
    "the complicated physics of pah / vsg emission is incorporated into the calculation of the emissivity tables .",
    "we use energy density tables calculated by @xcite for a fixed illuminating spectral shape .",
    "the actual illuminating spectral shape will be different , but this approximation is mitigated by quantifying the radiation field using specific energy , which is the integral of the mean intensity multiplied by the opacity of the grains .",
    "this measures the radiation absorbed by the grains . in effect , the spectral shape of the radiation field is taken into account to first order .",
    "this is discussed in more detail in @xcite , where they note that the ionization state assumed for the pahs is the bigger source of error .",
    "because of this approximation , our implementation is appropriate for such applications as interpreting evolutionary stages of protostars that emit pahs / vsg , but is not appropriate for investigating the detailed nature of the pahs ( e.g. , ionization stage ) . a more appropriate code for analyzing the physics of pah emission in protostellar disks / envelopes may be the radmc-3d code @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that low - mass t tauri stars do not emit pah emission because high - energy ( fuv , euv , x - ray ) emission from magnetospheric accretion onto the shocked stellar surface destroys the pahs and vsgs in the surrounding disk / envelope .",
    "in addition , the weaker radiation field in t tauri stars gives fewer positively ionized pahs @xcite .",
    "the low - mass models in our code distribution therefore include no pah / vsg emission ( however , this can easily be added in by the user ) .",
    "@xcite investigated the effects of sedimentation and pah abundance in aebe disks . since",
    "our dust models and stratification parameters are different , we can only do a qualitative comparison to their models ( figure 2 in their paper ) .",
    "the model parameters are : @xmath10k , @xmath11 , @xmath5 , @xmath12yr .",
    "the system luminosity is 56 @xmath7 .",
    "we assume a distance to the source of 100 pc to give the same flux as @xcite .",
    "our models , shown in the top panels of figure [ f_aebe_sed ] , produce similar seds .",
    "our spectral resolution is lower so the pah features are not as sharp .",
    "the bottom panels in figure [ f_aebe_sed ] show an embedded aebe protostar .",
    "since this is a younger source , the stellar and envelope parameters are different : @xmath13k , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16yr . both the embedded and the aebe disk sources show relatively stronger pah emission in the more edge - on viewing angles .",
    "this is because the warm _ thermal _ dust from the inner regions of the disk and envelope are more obscured from view at edge - on viewing angles , whereas the pah emission can be excited as long as the higher energy ( near - uv ) photons have an unobscured path in certain directions ( usually the polar regions ) and upper layers of the disk .    of interest to us",
    "is whether the pah emission affects the mid - ir colors of these objects .",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "space telescope has observed thousands of ysos , and color - color - diagram ( ccd ) and color - magnitude - diagram ( cmds ) are a common analysis tool .",
    "figure [ f_aebe_cc ] shows ccds of the aebe disk and embedded source models . for the most part ,",
    "the colors are similar with and without pah emission .",
    "the only exceptions are the edge - on sources , as explained above ; however , most edge - on sources are faint and may escape detection .",
    "this suggests that analysis that does nt include pah emission may be valid in some cases .",
    "however , more models with different parameters should be run to confirm this .",
    "our more massive embedded source model , in contrast to the embedded aebe model , shows relatively strong pah features at all viewing angles except pole - on , as shown in figure [ f_hmpo_sed ] , likely due to the higher stellar temperature producing more uv photons .",
    "the relevant parameters for this model are : @xmath17k , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20yr .",
    "the color - color plots also show this effect ( figure [ f_hmpo_cc ] ) with the pah sources appearing redder by up to 1 magnitude .",
    "massive protostars have been observed with and without pah emission @xcite .",
    "this is probably due to both the temperature of the central source ( a younger source will be cooler ) , and the amount of obscuration in the polar regions that can extinguish uv photons and thereby prevent stimulation of the pahs .    the images of the embedded aebe and massive yso models are shown in figure [ f_aebe_hmpo_img ] .",
    "these show that the massive yso is more embedded than the aebe one , with much redder thermal emission ( the left two panels , without pah emission ) . in both models , the pah emission lights up the cavities and outer envelope .",
    "high - mass stars of _ any _ evolutionary stage will heat up dust in the vicinity of the star whether associated with the star or not .",
    "@xcite show how to calculate the optically thin equilibrium temperature for dust heated by a central source ( their  7.4.2 ) . for typical ism dust properties ,",
    "the radius @xmath21 at which the dust is heated to a given temperature @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 from this we can calculate the `` sphere of influence '' of a massive star . for example , a b2 v star will heat dust above 30 k within a radius of @xmath24 pc .",
    "thus , a main sequence star in the vicinity of a molecular cloud , such as one recently formed , will heat up its surroundings .",
    "figure [ f_hmms_sed ] shows the sed of a b2 v star illuminating an optically thin dust cloud with an outer radius of 200,000 au . the density of the dust cloud is @xmath25gm/@xmath26 ( which corresponds to a number density of molecular hydrogen of 200 @xmath27 ) , and the a@xmath28 of the cloud is 0.5 ; the total mass of the envelope is 40 @xmath29 due to the large radius .",
    "the blue solid line shows the source viewed through a 4000 au aperture , or about 2@xmath30 at a distance of 2 kpc , a typical distance to nearby spiral arms in our galaxy .",
    "the blue dashed line has a foreground extinction of 4 magnitudes .",
    "this sed shape begins to resemble that of an embedded source .",
    "the pink line is for the same foreground extinction and viewed through an entire aperture of 200,000 au .",
    "this object at the distance of the magellanic clouds ( 50 - 60 kpc ) could masquerade as a protostar .",
    "in fact , @xcite have identified several yso candidates that are likely high - mass main sequence stars in the vicinity of a molecular cloud .",
    "how can we distinguish a main - sequence star illuminating optically thin dust from an embedded source based only on the sed ?",
    "in comparing the seds in figures [ f_hmpo_sed ] and [ f_hmms_sed ] , we can see differences in the pah / silicate features . in the embedded source ,",
    "the pah emission is weak relative to the thermal when viewed pole - on , and is combined with silicate absorption near edge - on .",
    "if not heavily extincted by interstellar dust , the main sequence star should have a bright optical source associated with it .",
    "ir imaging will easily distinguish the two types of objects in our galaxy , but in the magellanic clouds they may not be sufficiently resolved .      the external interstellar radiation field ( isrf )",
    "can heat up a disk or envelope and produce thermal as well as non - thermal emission .",
    "we use the galactic value computed near the solar neighborhood , given in table a3 of @xcite , in units of @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the average intensity @xcite .",
    "the input isrf can be scaled by an arbitrary factor and extincted by intervening dust .",
    "the isrf illuminates the yso from the outer radius of the envelope with an isotropic angular dependence .",
    "the luminosity of the isrf is @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the extinction function calculated from a standard interstellar extinction law and the input @xmath35 , @xmath36 is a user - specified scale factor , and @xmath37 is the outer radius of the envelope .",
    "we tested this with a model calculating the mean intensity of the solar neighborhood . for computation of the model images ,",
    "we count only the interacting photons in the photon summations .",
    "this is equivalent to doing background subtraction of images .",
    "external illumination can dominate in two ways : if the central source luminosity is very low , and/or if the outer radius of the envelope is very large .",
    "this occurs for very low - luminosity protostars and for large clumps or starless cores , as well as molecular clouds illuminated by `` cloud shine '' @xcite .",
    "several very low luminosity objects ( vellos ) were uncovered by the _",
    "space telescope in dense cores previously thought to be starless @xcite . due to their low intrinsic luminosity ,",
    "heating of the outer envelope from an external radiation field can dominate the luminosity of these sources .",
    "we show a model of such a source , both with and without external illumination , in figures [ f_vello_sed ] and [ f_vello_img ] .",
    "the intrinsic luminosity of the source is 0.01 @xmath7 and its outer radius is 5000 au .",
    "the illumination from the average galactic interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) on the outer radius of the envelope increases the luminosity to 0.07 @xmath7 .",
    "figure [ f_vello_sed ] shows the sed of the two models ( with and without isrf ) , and figure [ f_vello_img ] shows near - ir 3-color images .",
    "the isrf increases the scattered spectrum ( uv through near - ir ) and the far - infrared flux , due to the additional scattering and absorption ( heating ) in the outer envelope .",
    "the scattered spectrum is especially enhanced in the edge - on viewing angles .",
    "figures [ f_clump_sed ] and [ f_clump_img ] show seds and images of externally illuminated clumps with no internal luminosity source .",
    "these are centrally condensed cores ( @xmath38 ) with an outer radius of 100,000 au , and an envelope mass of 230 @xmath29 .",
    "we computed 2 models , one with a smooth density distribution , and the other with fractal clumping (  [ s_fractal ] ) .",
    "the seds are similar .",
    "the luminosities of the models are 36 @xmath7 .",
    "images of the clumpy model are shown in the near - ir and at _ spitzer _ irac wavelengths ( 3.6 - 8 @xmath39 m ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in figure [ f_clump_img ] .",
    "the irac images are red , dominated by the pah emission at 8 @xmath39 m .",
    "several objects in the lmc and smc have been identified with similar features and these may be externally illuminated clumps ( * ? ? ?",
    "* seale et al . , in prep ) .",
    "the previous version of the code included the envelope geometry of a rotating sphere in free - fall gravitational collapse @xcite .",
    "this version includes that as well as a simple power - law formation , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the fiducial density at 1 au ( units of g/@xmath26 ) and @xmath42 is the density exponent .",
    "this can be combined with bipolar cavities ( paper i ) , fractal clumping (  [ s_fractal ] ) , and gaps (  [ s_gaps_etc ] ) .",
    "this modification makes the code more general .",
    "for example , it can be used to model evolved stars ( agbs , carbon stars , proto - planetary nebulae ) .",
    "figure [ f_sed_powlaw ] shows example seds for a power - law envelope compared to the ulrich solution ( rotationally - flattened gravitational free - fall envelope ) for the low - mass class i model similar to that presented in paper ii .",
    "the seds are very similar .",
    "the main difference occurs in the 1 - 10 @xmath39 m region where the ulrich solution model is more extincted .",
    "this is also evident in the near - ir images shown in figure [ f_3col_powlaw ] .",
    "the ulrich solution has equatorial flattening in the envelope and this produces a redder image in the midplane and more extinction to the central source , as shown in the sed and images .",
    "this effect becomes more noticeable in the images as the centrifugal radius ( @xmath43 ) is increased .",
    "the pressure in bipolar outflows can cause the cavities to expand horizontally as well as vertically , causing pile - up of the material at the interface of the cavity and envelope , or thickened cavity walls . to mimic this effect , we define two cavity surfaces with different density profiles specified within each .",
    "if only one cavity surface is desired , simply specify the same density profile in both .",
    "the outer cavity surface can be described as a streamline shape or a polynomial .",
    "the streamline shape is described in @xcite : at large distances it appears conical ; closer to the source it is curved , and intersects the disk at a radius that depends on the opening angle chosen for the hole and the centrifugal radius .",
    "the inner cavity surface is a polynomial shape , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the cylindrical radius ; @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and the opening angle of the cavity defined at the outer radius , @xmath48 , are input by the user ; and @xmath49 is calculated based on @xmath48 .",
    "if a polynomial shape is specified for the outer cavity wall , it is described by the same function with different input variables ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 . inside each cavity surface",
    "the density follows a power - law : @xmath52 , and @xmath53 . for simplicity",
    "the power - law exponent is the same within each surface , with only the fiducial density changing . modifying the code for other cavity structures is straightforward .",
    "some observed objects appear to show strong delineation of the cavity walls , for example , the hst nicmos images of coku tau/1 and dg tau b @xcite .",
    "the brightness of these features depends strongly on the optical depth through cavity , walls , and envelope .",
    "if the optical depth is too high , the cavity will appear filled in due to forward scattering from the near wall .",
    "figures [ f_sed_2walls ] and [ f_3col_2walls ] show seds and near - ir images for a model with enhanced density in the wall between the outflow cavity and envelope , and decreased ( to zero ) density in the outflow cavity , compared to the standard class i model ( figure [ f_3col_powlaw ] , left ) .",
    "the seds are slightly modified from the standard class i model , especially pole - on where the optical extinction along the cavity direction is different between the two models .",
    "we incorporate fractal clumping , following a recipe described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have used this algorithm previously to model scattered light nebulae @xcite , uchii regions @xcite and extragalactic super star clusters @xcite .",
    "the fractal clumping is incorporated as a fractional variation on the density structure of the disk / envelope / outflow , specified by an input variable which is the ratio of clumped to smooth density .",
    "currently , to simplify input parameters , the code is set up to give a fractal dimension of the clumping @xmath54 , and a power spectrum exponent of @xmath55 , in agreement with observed values in the ism ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein )",
    ".    observed images of protostars show evidence for clumpiness in their outflows and possibly envelopes as well . the six class i / ii sources observed by @xcite at high spatial resolution with hst nicmos are examples .",
    "we added fractal clumpiness to our class i model and show the seds and near - ir images in figures [ f_sed_fractal ] and [ f_3col_fractal ] .",
    "we first included clumpiness throughout the entire circumstellar disk / envelope / outflow , and found that the images lose most of the axisymmetrical features unless the ratio of clumpy to smooth density was 0.05 or less .",
    "most observed protostars , even those with apparent clumpiness , show typical axisymmetric structures of disks and bipolar outflows .",
    "many show more clumpiness in the outflow cavities .",
    "perhaps the motions in the outflows are more turbulent . on the other hand , @xcite show evidence for complex structure in class 0 protostars in both imagery and velocity structure .",
    "further investigations of model images compared to data can place limits on the smooth to clumpy ratio in both the envelope and outflows .",
    "figure [ f_clump_img ] shows an example model with clumps in the outflow only ( left ) vs clumps throughout the circumstellar environment ( right ) .",
    "the outflow clumpiness has a clumpy to smooth ratio of 0.9 . the model with clumps",
    "throughout has a ratio of 0.5 .      in the magnetospheric accretion model",
    ", thought to be appropriate in low - mass t tauri stars ( pre - main sequence stars surrounded by disks and possibly envelopes ) , material accretes through the disk until it reaches the disk truncation radius , where it then flows along magnetic field lines and crashes onto the stellar surface .",
    "idealized models assume a dipole magnetic field on the star . in these models ,",
    "the material flows along these field lines and shocks onto two `` hot spots '' on the star where the dipole field is the strongest .",
    "the dust sublimates inside the dust destruction radius , so the material is in the form of gas .",
    "however , if the truncation radius is close to the dust sublimation radius , this gas may entrain and uplift dust in the disk , causing a `` warp '' in the dusty disk structure .",
    "some visualizations of these processes can be found in new 3-d magnetohydrodynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "we have added stellar hotspots and inner disk warps to our code to simulate these processes and allow users to test predictions of the magnetospheric model against data .",

    "<S> we have updated our publicly available dust radiative transfer code ( hochunk3d ) to include new emission processes and various 3-d geometries appropriate for forming stars . </S>",
    "<S> the 3-d geometries include warps and spirals in disks , accretion hotspots on the central star , fractal clumping density enhancements , and misaligned inner disks . </S>",
    "<S> additional axisymmetric ( 2-d ) features include gaps in disks and envelopes ,  puffed - up inner rims \" in disks , multiple bipolar cavity walls , and iteration of disk vertical structure assuming hydrostatic equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> we include the option for simple power - law envelope geometry , which combined with fractal clumping , and bipolar cavities , can be used to model evolved stars as well as protostars . </S>",
    "<S> we include non - thermal emission from pahs and very small grains , and external illumination from the interstellar radiation field . </S>",
    "<S> the grid structure was modified to allow multiple dust species in each cell ; based on this , a simple prescription is implemented to model dust stratification .    </S>",
    "<S> we describe these features in detail , and show example calculations of each . </S>",
    "<S> some of the more interesting results include the following : 1 ) outflow cavities may be more clumpy than infalling envelopes . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) pah emission in high - mass stars may be a better indicator of evolutionary stage than the broadband sed slope ; and related to this , 3 ) externally illuminated clumps and high - mass stars in optically thin clouds can masquerade as ysos . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ) our hydrostatic equilibrium models suggest that dust settling is likely ubiquitous in t tauri disks , in agreement with previous observations . </S>"
