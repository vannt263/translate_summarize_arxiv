    "<S> the hamiltonian cycle problem ( hcp ) in digraphs @xmath0 with degree bound two is solved by two mappings in this paper . the first bijection is between an incidence matrix @xmath1 of simple digraph and an incidence matrix @xmath2 of balanced bipartite undirected graph @xmath3 ; the second mapping is from a perfect matching of @xmath3 to a cycle of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> it proves that the complexity of hcp in @xmath0 is polynomial , and finding a second non - isomorphism hamiltonian cycle from a given hamiltonian digraph with degree bound two is also polynomial . </S>",
    "<S> lastly it deduces @xmath4 base on the results . </S>"
