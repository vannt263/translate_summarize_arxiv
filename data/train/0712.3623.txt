    "plutonium dioxide ( puo@xmath0 ) and sesquioxide ( pu@xmath0o@xmath1 ) are the only observed stoichiometric compounds formed at the surface of the metallic plutonium when exposed to dry air @xcite ( nonstoichiometric oxide may form by reaction of dioxide with water @xcite ) . from this sense , plutonium corrosion and oxidation",
    "are often treated as equivalent topic .",
    "the plutonium corrosion plays a key role in considering the nuclear stockpile and storage of surplus plutonium .",
    "therefore , a thorough understanding of the physical and chemical properties of the plutonium oxide is always needed .",
    "from basic point of view , it can be visualized that many physical and chemical properties of the plutonium oxide are closely related to the quantum process of localization and delocalization for pu 5@xmath4 electrons .",
    "modeling of the electron localization , and thus any redox process involving plutonium , is a complex task .",
    "conventional density functional schemes that apply the local density approximation ( lda ) or the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) underestimate the strong on - site coulomb repulsion of the pu 5@xmath4 electrons and consequently fail to capture the correlation - driven localization .",
    "therefore , the 5@xmath4 electrons in elemental pu , as well as in pu compounds , require special attention .",
    "one promising way to improve contemporary lda and gga approaches is to modify the intra - atomic coulomb interaction through the so - called lda+@xmath2 or gga+@xmath2 approach , in which the underestimation of the intraband coulomb interaction is corrected by the hubbard @xmath2 parameter @xcite .",
    "this method has been used to discuss the equilibrium lattice parameter of bulk pu in ref .",
    "the choice of @xmath2 is , however , not unambiguous and it is not trivial to determine its value _ a priori _ , though there are attempts to extract it from standard first - principles calculations .",
    "hence , @xmath2 is often fitted to reproduce a certain set of experimental data such as band gaps and structural properties .    in this paper",
    "we use the lda+@xmath2 and gga+@xmath2 schemes due to dudarev et al .",
    "@xcite to calculate the lattice parameters , electronic structure , and thermodynamic properties of puo@xmath0 and pu@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "we discuss how these properties are affected by the choice of @xmath2 as well as the choice of exchange - correlation potential , i.e. , the lda or the gga , and how redox processes occurred in plutonium oxide can be explored in the lda+@xmath2 and gga+@xmath2 formalism .",
    "in addition , we notice that recently there have occurred a few experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies of the electronic structures of plutonium oxides . in this paper we have compared our calculated lda / gga+@xmath2 results with those reports .",
    "our results show that while the pure lda / gga ( without @xmath2 correction ) calculations fail to describe the ground - state behaviors of the plutonium oxides , such as the insulating nature , the magnetic configuration , and the @xmath3 band gap , the present lda / gga+@xmath2 approaches with tunable coulomb parameters can effectively remedy those failures and the consequent results fit well in the attainable experimental data @xcite .",

    "2@xmath5 and 2@xmath6 electrons were treated as valence electrons .",
    "the strong on - site coulomb repulsion amongst the localized pu @xmath3 electrons are accounted for by using the formalism formulated by dudarev _",

    "the total lda ( gga ) energy functional is of the form@xmath7   , \\label{e1}%\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the density matrix of @xmath4 states , and @xmath2 and @xmath9 are the spherically averaged screened coulomb energy and the exchange energy , respectively . in this paper the coulomb @xmath2 is treated as a variable , while the exchange energy is set to be a constant @xmath9=0.75 ev .",
    "this value of @xmath9 is in the ball park of the commonly accepted one for pu @xcite .",
    "since only the difference between @xmath2 and @xmath9 is significant @xcite , thus we will henceforth label them as one single parameter , for simplicity labeled as @xmath2 , while keeping in mind that the non - zero @xmath9 has been used during calculations .",
    "the exchange and correlation effects were treated in both the local density approximation and the generalized gradient approximation @xcite .",

    "the turning value of @xmath2 for this fm - afm energy transition of the ground state is of @xmath221.5 ev . in the discussion that follows , we therefore confined our report to the afm solution for the puo@xmath0 .",

    "these two pronounced peaks have been observed in the recent photoemission measurements @xcite .",
    "in addition , by increasing the amplitude of @xmath2 , one prominent feature occurred in fig . 3 is the increasing hybridization between pu @xmath3 and o @xmath31 occupied states .",
    "this interesting mixing effect disappears in the cases of pu@xmath0o@xmath1 ( see fig . 6 below ) and uo@xmath0 @xcite , for which the pu ( u ) @xmath3 and o @xmath31 occupied bands are well separated .",
    "the presence of pu(@xmath3)-pu(@xmath31 ) hybridization in puo@xmath0 implies a more covalent and stronger metal - ligand mixing than in pu@xmath35o@xmath1 and uo@xmath0 .",
    "this phenomenon appears surprising , given the smaller overlap anticipated in pu because of the smaller radius of the pu @xmath3 orbital .",
    "experimentally , butterfield _ et al_. @xcite and gouder _ et al_. @xcite have reported the thin - film photoemission data for puo@xmath0 . the present overall picture which emerges from the lda / gga+@xmath2 with properly selective coulomb repulsion",
    "appear to be in satisfactory agreement with experiment .",
    "we have also compared our results given in fig .",
    "3 with the most recent calculations by prodan _ et al_. @xcite based on newly developed screened coulomb hybrid density functional .",
    "the agreement between our lda / gga+@xmath2 ( with @xmath364 ev ) results and those in ref .",
    "@xcite is also apparent .",
    "interestingly , the above - mentioned orbital ( pu @xmath3 and o @xmath31 ) mixing effect in puo@xmath0 has also been theoretically predicted by prodan _ et al_. @xcite , who hypotheses that the expected stabilization of the pu @xmath3 orbital energy relative to u @xmath3 leads to an accidental  degeneracy between the pu @xmath3 and o @xmath31 levels , which in the first - order perturbation theory results in a higher degree of covalency regardless of small radius of the pu @xmath3 orbital .",
    "therefore , although the pure lda and gga fail to depict the electronic structure , especially the insulating nature and the occupied - state character of puo@xmath0 , our present results show that by tuning the effective hubbard parameter in a reasonable range , the lda / gga+@xmath2 approaches will prominently improve upon the pure lda / gga calculations and thus can provide a satisfactory qualitative electronic structure description comparable with experiments and the hybrid dft calculation . by further increasing @xmath2 to 6 ev",
    ", one can see that the peak near @xmath342.0 ev becomes weak and is mostly o @xmath31 , while the peak near @xmath344.0 ev becomes stronger and consists equally of pu 5@xmath4 and o 2@xmath6 orbital .",
    "this picture of dos is no longer valid since the peak near @xmath342.0 ev has been confirmed to be due to the pu 5@xmath4 contribution . thus the lda / gga+u approaches with @xmath2 as large as 6 ev fails to describe the electronic structure of puo@xmath0 .",

    "thus the curvature of @xmath26 for small values of @xmath2 is more significant than for large values of @xmath2 .",
    "the decrease in curvature at large @xmath2 corresponds to the separation of the occupied pu @xmath3 band from the unoccupied part , i.e. , the transition from a metallic to an insulating ground state of pu@xmath0o@xmath1 ( see below ) .",

    "another feature shown in fig .",
    "5(a ) is that at small values of @xmath2 below 4 ev the gga underestimates @xmath26 , which is contrary to the general experience that in most cases ( as shown for puo@xmath0 ) , the gga often gives a slight overestimate of lattice parameter .",
    "this rarely - occurred feature may be due to the appearance of the other lattice parameter in @xmath11pu@xmath0o@xmath1 , i.e. , the rario @xmath41 for the hexagonal crystalline structure .",

    "<S> the electronic structure and properties of puo@xmath0 and pu@xmath0o@xmath1 have been studied from first principles by the all - electron projector - augmented - wave ( paw ) method . </S>",
    "<S> the local density approximation ( lda)+@xmath2 and the generalized gradient approximation ( gga)+@xmath2 formalism have been used to account for the strong on - site coulomb repulsion among the localized pu @xmath3 electrons . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how the properties of puo@xmath0 and pu@xmath0o@xmath1 are affected by the choice of @xmath2 as well as the choice of exchange - correlation potential . </S>",
    "<S> also , oxidation reaction of pu@xmath0o@xmath1 , leading to formation of puo@xmath0 , and its dependence on @xmath2 and exchange - correlation potential have been studied . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that by choosing an appropriate @xmath2 it is promising to correctly and consistently describe structural , electronic , and thermodynamic properties of puo@xmath0 and pu@xmath0o@xmath1 , which enables it possible the modeling of redox process involving pu - based materials . </S>"
