    "@xcite for a recent review of the theoretical and experimental aspects ) . here",
    "we consider the consequences that the introduction of a magnetic background field may have on the screening lengths of the thermal medium .",
    "the presence of strong magnetic backgrounds , with field strengths comparable to the qcd scale , is a situation common to many contexts , ranging from cosmology  @xcite and non - central heavy ion collisions  @xcite , with magnetic fields going up to @xmath3 tesla ( @xmath4  gev@xmath5 ) , to magnetars  @xcite , where magnetic fields of the order of @xmath6 tesla are expected on the surface , and possibly higher in the inner core .    how the properties of strongly interacting matter are modified by such magnetic fields has been the subject of many theoretical efforts , see refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews .",
    "as regards the effects more directly related to color interactions , various studies have considered the possible influence of an external magnetic field on the static quark - antiquark potential  @xcite , which has been clarified by recent lattice results  @xcite , and might have consequences relevant to the spectrum of heavy quark bound states  @xcite . at zero temperature ,",
    "the potential becomes anisotropic and the string tension @xmath7 is larger ( smaller ) in the direction orthogonal ( parallel ) to the magnetic field @xmath8  @xcite ; at finite @xmath9 , in particular in the region right below the pseudocritical temperature @xmath10 , the magnetic field induces a general suppression of @xmath7  @xcite , leading to an early onset of deconfinement , in agreement with the observed dependence of @xmath10 on @xmath2  @xcite    in this paper we extend the study to the region of temperatures above @xmath10 , in order to investigate the effects of a magnetic background on the interactions between heavy quarks in the quark - gluon plasma . in this phase ,",
    "the effective interaction is no longer confining and can instead be described by a screened coulomb form , with two different screening lengths / masses characterizing the ( color)electric and the ( color)magnetic sectors . studying the appropriate combinations of polyakov loop correlators by means of lattice qcd simulations at the physical point we estimated the screening lengths for @xmath11 and several values of the external magnetic field ( for @xmath12 ) . from these results",
    "we conclude that the magnetic field induces a reduction of both screening lengths ( i.e. an increasing of the screening masses ) , which might induce a further suppression of the formation of heavy quark bound states in the thermal medium .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss our numerical setup and review the definition of the screening masses in terms of polyakov loop correlators . in section",
    "iii we present our numerical results . finally ,",
    "in section iv , we draw our conclusions .",
    "the screening masses of strongly interacting matter have been historically introduced in perturbation theory by studying the pole structure of the finite temperature gluon propagator .",
    "while this approach presents no difficulties for the computation of the leading order electric screening mass ( see e.g. @xcite ) , it was soon realized that perturbation theory gets into trouble at higher orders , or even at the leading order for the magnetic mass , because of the infrared sensitivity of the obtained expressions @xcite .",
    "the natural way to overcome these difficulties and obtain nonperturbative results for the screening masses is to analyze the large distance behavior of gauge - invariant correlation functions . for this purpose ,",
    "correlators of polyakov loops have been traditionally used @xcite and the two independent correlators that can be studied are @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the polyakov loop operator , which is defined in the continuum by @xmath15 in this expression @xmath16 is the number of colors and the symbol @xmath17 denotes the path - ordered exponential .",
    "the correlator @xmath18 is often studied because of its connection with the free energy @xmath19 of a static quark - antiquark pair , that can be computed using the relation @xcite @xmath20 the study of @xmath21 is thus the finite temperature counterpart of the study of wilson loops at zero temperature , from which the potential energy of a static quark - antiquark pair can be extracted . since in any numerical study",
    "the temporal extent of the lattice is always finite , it would also be possible to extract the static potential as the zero temperature limit of the free energy extracted from polyakov loops , however this second procedure is generically not numerically convenient because of the much larger statistical errors involved .     and the real part of the correlator @xmath22 for @xmath23 ( in both cases we considered the connected correlators ) .",
    "only the case @xmath24 is reported for clarity but also in the case of non - vanishing external magnetic field the behaviour of the correlators is qualitatively similar . ]    in the following we will need also the somehow less used correlator @xmath25 ; a comparison of the behaviour of @xmath26 and @xmath27 for @xmath23 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : corrsllandlldag ] , from which it is clear that the very large distance behavior of these two correlators is the same .",
    "in fact , the two correlators turn out to be substantially different only in the confined phase , where the @xmath25 correlator is strongly suppressed also at short distances because of the confining properties of the medium vanishes exactly at all distances in the confined phase , because of the exact center symmetry . ] .    under euclidean - time reversal @xmath28 the color - magnetic and color - electric gluon components , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , are respectively even and odd .",
    "since the polyakov loop transforms under such a transformation as @xmath31 , the following combinations @xmath32 receive contributions only from the magnetic and electric sectors respectively .",
    "these quantities can be further decomposed in eigenstates of the charge conjugation operator @xmath33 : under this symmetry @xmath34 and we thus obtain @xmath35 where the subscripts @xmath36 indicates the @xmath33 eigenvalues .",
    "such a decomposition has been introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and it has been recently used in some lattice computations ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    from the definitions in eq .",
    "it immediately follows that the magnetic odd and the electric even sectors are trivial , i.e. @xmath37 and that the following relations hold true @xmath38 using the previous relations , the correlators needed to investigate the magnetic and electric sectors can be written in the form @xmath39 where the minus sign in the definition of @xmath40 is conventional and in the electric case no disconnected term is present because of the symmetry under charge conjugation .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite the previous correlators in term of @xmath41 and @xmath21 and the final result is @xmath42- \\left|\\langle \\mathrm{tr}l\\rangle \\right|^2\\\\      c_{e^-}=&-\\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{re}\\big[c_{ll}-c_{ll^\\dag}\\big ] \\ ; . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that the mixed electric - magnetic correlator @xmath43 is zero by charge conjugation invariance , meaning that the real and imaginary parts of the polyakov loop fluctuate independently .",
    "the electric and magnetic screening masses can now be extracted from the large distance behaviour of the correlators in eqs .  .",
    "in particular , in the very high temperature regime , one expects @xcite these quantities to scale as @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the electric and magnetic screening masses respectively . in the subsequent analysis",
    ", we will use these expressions to extract the screening masses from the correlators computed on the lattice . in the presence of an external magnetic field",
    ", we obviously have to take into account the explicit breaking of the rotational symmetry : correlators taken along directions parallel or orthogonal to the magnetic field can not be averaged , and two _ a priori _ different electric screening masses and magnetic screening masses have to be defined .      in this work we have adopted a discretization of @xmath48 qcd based on the symanzik tree - level improved gauge action and the stout smeared rooted staggered action for the fermionic sector .",

    "@xcite , with an isotropic smearing parameter @xmath60 , and the @xmath61 parallel transporters @xmath62 , which takes the presence of the external electromagnetic field into account ; in both cases the latin indices denote the position in the lattice and the greek indices denote the direction of the link .    for a constant and uniform magnetic background directed along the @xmath63 direction ,",
    "a possible choice of the @xmath61 phases is ( @xmath64 is the fermion charge ) @xmath65 while all the other @xmath61 link variables are set to 1 . for this choice to actually describe a uniform magnetic field on the lattice with periodic boundary conditions , it is necessary for the value of @xmath66 to satisfy the following quantization condition @xcite @xmath67    in our numerical simulations , we used for the bare parameters the values @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , which correspond @xcite to a lattice spacing @xmath71 and to physical values of the pion and strange quark masses ( isospin breaking is neglected ) .",
    "we performed simulations on @xmath72 lattices , with @xmath73 , corresponding to a fixed spatial size of around 5 fm and to temperatures @xmath74 .",
    "polyakov loop correlators have been measured on a set of around @xmath75 configurations for each temperature ( with measures separated by 5 molecular dynamics trajectories ) and , to reduce the statistical noise , a single step of hyp smearing @xcite has been applied to the temporal links , with the parameters of the hyp2-action , see ref .",
    "correlators have been extracted for generic orientations ( i.e. not just along the lattice axes ) at @xmath76 , while in the presence of the background field we have considered separately correlators along the @xmath77 axis ( i.e. parallel to @xmath2 ) and in the whole @xmath78 plane ( i.e. orthogonal to @xmath2 ) , which in the following will be denoted respectively by @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "note that , since polyakov loops renormalize multiplicatively and no further distance - dependent renormalization enters the correlator , the screening masses defined by eq .",
    "do not need any renormalization .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : corrs ] , we show an example of the electric and magnetic correlators for @xmath23 at @xmath81 and @xmath82 . at zero magnetic field",
    "all possible orientations are displayed , while for non - zero field only orientations perpendicular or parallel to the magnetic field are considered .",
    "for this reason , the three curves in each panel have different number of points .",
    "the points at zero magnetic field approximately lay a single curve , indicating that the lattice violations of rotational invariance are small .",
    "this holds true also for correlators defined in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field , indicating that the residual @xmath83 subgroup of @xmath84 left unbroken by the presence of @xmath8 is well realized on the lattice for these correlator , and in short , that lattice artefacts are small .",
    "the external magnetic field is expected to modify the correlators both by changing the screening masses and by inducing anisotropies in the correlators .",
    "[ fig : corrs ] shows that both the electric and the magnetic correlators approach zero faster when an external magnetic field is present , a fact that implies that the screening masses are increasing functions of @xmath2 .",
    "the anisotropy of the correlators is in general not easy to observe in the high temperature regime ( see also @xcite ) , since correlators decay very quickly and it is possible to estimate them with enough relative accuracy only for a short distance ; nevertheless , for the relatively low @xmath9 and high @xmath2 case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : corrs ] , the anisotropy is present and more pronounced in the magnetic correlator ( whose signal is larger than the electric one ) .    in order to determine the screening masses from the correlators , numerical data have been fitted with the functional form in eq .  , adopting a bootstrap approach to propagate the correlations between data .",
    "several fit intervals have been investigated in order to assess the stability and reliability of the results and to estimate the systematic uncertainties associated with the fitting procedure . in table",
    "[ tab : datapoints ] we report the numerical values obtained and in figs .  [",
    "fig : m_vs_eb]-[fig : m_vs_t ] we show a graphical representation of their behavior as a function of @xmath85 and @xmath9 .",
    "at vanishing magnetic field we reproduced the known behavior of @xmath86 and @xmath87 : the electric screening mass is larger than the magnetic one and the ratios @xmath88 and @xmath89 are remarkably insensitive to the value of the temperature , something that _ a priori _ would have been expected to hold only at much higher temperatures .",

    "the masses increase linearly with the magnetic field for moderate or large @xmath2 values ( i.e. for @xmath127 ) and a reasonable _ ansatz _ can be given to describe the connection of this regime with the expected quadratic behaviour for small values of @xmath2 , in which both screening masses are proportional to @xmath9 and to a function of @xmath103 .",

    "the observed increase of the screening masses as a function of @xmath2 is in qualitative agreement with perturbative computations  @xcite and with the behavior already observed below @xmath10 : the magnetic background tends to suppress the confining properties of the thermal medium below @xmath10 , and to enhance the screening of color interactions above @xmath10 . in both cases , one can interpret the effect in terms of the decrease of the pesudo - critical temperature @xmath10 as a function of @xmath2  @xcite , so that in the low temperature phase one approaches deconfinement as @xmath2 increases , while at high temperature one gets farther from the transition and color screening gets stronger by increasing @xmath2 .",
    "following this line of reasoning , no particular critical behavior is expected in the high temperature phase when approaching the large magnetic field limit , since the system will just become more deconfined ( i.e. color interactions will be more and more screened ) ; this is in contrast to what happens below @xmath10 or to what might happen even at @xmath128  @xcite .",
    "the increasing of the screening masses induced by the presence of an external magnetic field could in principle lead to a stronger suppression of heavy quark bound states in peripheral heavy - ion collisions and , more specifically , to a direct relation between suppression and centrality .",

    "@xcite , an in deep discussion should consider also the modifications of the radius of the heavy quarks bound states as a function of @xmath2 , since it is the reduction of the screening length with respect to such radius which brings to the actual suppression ; a direct computation of quarkonia spectral functions in the presence of magnetic background is surely something that should be addressed by future lattice studies .",
    "moreover , in order to assess the relevance of our results to heavy ion phenomenology , one should first of all know to which extent the magnetic field produced in non - central heavy ion collisions survives the thermalization process , not to mention all the other dynamical processes that make it difficult to safely predict the fate of heavy quark bound states even in the absence of external magnetic field .",
