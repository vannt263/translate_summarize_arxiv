    "hence , it is crucial to obtain the reduced density matrix ( rdm ) containing higher orders of the system - bath coupling in order to extract essential information about the physical quantities related to transport .    our main goal in this paper is to obtain the nonequilibrium _ steady - state reduced density matrix _ for a general system connected to multiple heat baths up to @xmath0-nd order in the system - bath coupling .",
    "we achieve this using an analytic continuity technique , which we have introduced previously @xcite for the case of thermal equilibrium . for this non - trivial steady - state nonequilibrium case",

    "it is only recently that dhar , saito , and hnggi @xcite have analytically obtained the exact steady - state rdm of an open system composed of harmonic oscillators . due to the lack of exact general solutions for anharmonic systems in nonequilibrium steady - state , in this work",
    "we corroborate our result with the analytic solution of dhar _",
