    "in optical lattices  @xcite , atoms are trapped in a periodic array of micron - sized potential wells .",
    "atoms confined in these potential wells exhibit a rich dynamical behaviour which can be probed by a number of techniques , including probe absorption spectroscopy  @xcite , heterodyne fluorescence spectroscopy  @xcite , recoil - induced resonances  @xcite , intensity correlation spectroscopy  @xcite , and observation of the redistribution of photons between the lattice - inducing beams  @xcite . using these techniques , the quantized nature of the motion of the atoms in the potential wells has been demonstrated , yielding information on the vibrational frequencies of the atoms , the motion of wavepackets , and on the decay of coherences between the bound oscillator states .",
    "recently , a novel method has been suggested and experimentally demonstrated which effectively probes the coherences set up between different vibrational states of the trapped atoms  @xcite .",
    "this method has a number of advantages over other schemes , as we shall demonstrate .",
    "most importantly , the possibility of selectively exciting one particular dynamical mode of the lattice allows one to fit theoretical predictions to experimental spectra easily and reliably .",
    "+ in this paper we are predominantly concerned with resonances of the coherent transient spectra corresponding to stimulated raman transitions between adjacent vibrational levels .",
    "the mechanisms responsible for the decay of the vibrational coherences and the resulting widths of the raman peaks are still a subject of debate , and a comprehensive study is as yet absent from the literature . in what follows , we present the results of our experiments conducted on a three - dimensional lattice of cesium atoms in the _ oscillating regime _",
    "in which the oscillatory motion of the trapped atoms is only rarely interrupted by inelastic photon scattering events .",
    "the converse case of optical lattices operating in the jumping regime has been treated by mennerat - robilliard and co - workers @xcite . in our experiments",
    "the intensity , detuning , and geometry of the lattice were varied independently , and the resulting variations of the positions and widths of the vibrational raman peaks were measured and compared with theoretical models . + in another set of experiments , we loaded an optical lattice with atoms having an initial kinetic temperature higher than the steady - state temperature in the lattice and made time - resolved measurements of the vibrational frequency as the atoms came to equilibrium in the lattice .",
    "as the distribution of atoms amongst the vibrational states evolved , the measured vibrational frequency was observed to change owing to the perturbations to the energy spacings of the bound levels caused by the anharmonicity of the potential .",
    "+ this paper is organised as follows . in section  [ setup ] the experimental setup",
    "is described , and in section  [ results ] we present the results of the experiments .",
    "section  [ theory ] contains a brief discussion of the various mechanisms involved in determining the frequency widths of the vibrational raman resonances observed in optical lattices and a comparison of the experimental data with theoretical models .",
    "finally , section  [ conclusion ] summarizes our findings .",
    "in our experiment , we trap and cool cesium atoms in a standard six - beam magneto - optical trap ( mot ) operating on the @xmath0 transition  @xcite . after a @xmath1 trapping period , the magnetic field gradient is switched off and the atoms are further cooled for a few milliseconds in an optical molasses to a temperature of around @xmath2 .",
    "the molasses beams are then switched off and the lattice beams switched on .",
    "the geometry of the lattice beams is the standard tetrahedron configuration @xcite with splitting half - angles @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where in our experiment @xmath4 is fixed and @xmath3 is variable ( see fig .  [ fig : setup ] ) .",
    "the lattice operates on the same transition as the mot , detuned to the low frequency side by @xmath5 to @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the excited state lifetime ( @xmath8 for cesium ) .",
    "the intensity of the lattice beams in our experiment lies between @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "in addition to the four lattice beams , a weak ( @xmath11 ) probe beam propagates either along the @xmath12- or the @xmath13-axis .",
    "the detuning @xmath14 of the probe laser from the lattice laser can be controlled by an acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) connected to a tunable radio - frequency source .",
    "+ coherent transient spectra are recorded as follows : after the atoms have equilibrated in the lattice for a few milliseconds , the probe beam is switched on for @xmath15 at detuning @xmath14 ( see also section  [ theory ] ) .",
    "after that time , at @xmath16 the detuning is increased by @xmath17 within less than @xmath18 .",
    "after the increase in the detuning of the probe light , it no longer interacts with the atoms and serves as a local oscillator for the heterodyne detection of the light scattered by the atoms in the lattice .",
    "the signal arising from the beating of the lattice light scattered by the atoms and the local oscillator is then recorded with a fast photodiode .",
    "assuming that the coherently scattered light from the lattice decays exponentially with time at a rate @xmath19 , the observed signal ( expressed as a voltage @xmath20 ) is of the form @xmath21\\nonumber \\\\",
    "+ \\frac{1}{2}(i_{probe}+i_{coh})\\quad,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the intensities of the probe and the coherently scattered light , respectively , and @xmath24 is the amount by which the probe frequency is suddenly switched at @xmath16 . a fast - fourier - transform ( fft ) is then performed on the signal to yield its frequency spectrum .",
    "our spectra are shifted by subtracting the frequency jump @xmath24 , so that a rayleigh peak ( for which @xmath25 initially ) appears at zero frequency in our spectra .",
    "+ in the case of the time - resolved equilibration experiment described in section  [ equili ] , the lattice is loaded directly from the mot with a temperature of order @xmath26 , and the atoms are then allowed to equilibrate in the lattice for a variable length of time . after this period",
    "the vibrational excitation of the trapped atoms is probed and read - out as described above .",
    "some aspects of the dynamical behaviour of atoms in optical lattices are better understood than others .",
    "the vibrational frequencies of the atoms , for instance , can be rather accurately predicted and modelled using a simple harmonic oscillator picture ( for potential wells that are deep enough for a tight - binding model to be valid )  @xcite .",
    "discrepancies with experiments can be accounted for by the anharmonicity of the potential , which can be treated perturbatively  @xcite .",
    "+ on the other hand , the lifetimes of atoms in these oscillator states and of the coherences between different states , and hence the widths they give rise to in the coherent transient spectra , are not yet well understood .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed that could be responsible for the observed widths of these vibrational raman peaks  @xcite . in particular , the photon scattering rate of atoms in a light field turns out to be much larger than the observed widths of the raman peaks , indicating that the decay of coherences between vibrational levels is strongly suppressed .",
    "the mechanisms responsible for this suppression will be dealt with in more detail in section  [ mechs ] .",
    "+ in order to carry out a comprehensive study , we independently varied the detuning , intensity , and geometry ( characterized by the two splitting angles ) of the lattice and determined both the position and the width of the raman peaks in the coherent transient spectrum by fitting lorentzians to the experimentally obtained spectra .",
    "typical experimental results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio even of a single - shot measurement is good , so that little averaging is necessary .",
    "the signal recorded by the photodiode is , in general , a sum of exponentially damped beat - notes between the light scattered by the trapped atoms and the probe light .",
    "when the probe is initially tuned to the same frequency as the lattice beams , one sees a narrow rayleigh peak and two peaks resulting from off - resonantly excited vibrational coherences . when detuning the probe from the lattice beams by an amount equal to the separation between a raman peak and the rayleigh peak ( i.e. the vibrational frequency of the atoms ) , one can selectively excite the vibrational raman coherences alone and hence obtain a spectrum that only reflects one excitation mode of the lattice , in contrast to probe absorption spectra , where resonances associated with many modes are superimposed .",
    "it is found that the resulting spectrum can be well fitted to a lorentzian , and in what follows we will refer to the width ( fwhm ) of such a lorentzian fit as the width of the raman peak .",
    "a further advantage of the method of coherent transients is the fact that the preparation and the read - out of the vibrational coherence grating are separated in time .",
    "the frequency - selectivity in the excitation phase therefore depends on the frequency bandwidth of the initial probe pulse , whilst the resolution of the spectrum only depends on the read - out time . by making the read - out time as short as possible whilst maintaining a reasonable resolution ,",
    "time - dependent studies of the evolution of atoms in an optical lattice can be performed .",
    "this is discussed in more detail in section  [ equili ] . + as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] , the rayleigh peaks are of much smaller width than the raman peaks .",
    "these widths yield information on the rate of transfer of atoms between neighbouring wells and are discussed in detail in  @xcite . in this paper , however , we shall concentrate our attention on the vibrational raman peaks . +      for a tetrahedral lattice ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : setup ] ) in which the polarizations of the four lattice beams are perpendicular to the planes spanned by each pair of nearly co - propagating beams , one can derive simple expressions for the vibrational frequencies in a harmonic approximation of the potential close to a minimum  @xcite : @xmath27 and @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the recoil energy with @xmath30 for an optical lattice employing cesium atoms and light tuned close to the d2 resonance line and @xmath31 is the potential well - depth given by @xmath32 ( @xmath33 is the intensity of a single beam , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the detuning of the lattice beams ) .",
    "these theoretical predictions have been verified to yield the correct dependence on @xmath36 , @xmath33 , and @xmath37 , but the experimental results usually fall short of the theoretical values by 15 - 25 percent . in our experiment",
    ", we varied the potential well - depth @xmath31 ( ranging from @xmath38 to @xmath39 ) both by varying the intensity ( between @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) and the detuning ( between @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) and measured the positions of the raman peaks of the corresponding coherent transient spectra along the @xmath12- and the @xmath13- directions .",

    "[ fig : intdet ] ( a ) is @xmath46 , which is close to the theoretically predicted value of @xmath47 .",
    "+ the results of measurements of the raman widths for the cases of the probe propagating along both the @xmath12- and the @xmath13-directions are shown in fig .",
    "[ intdet](b ) where , for clarity , most of the error bars have been omitted  @xcite . for the most part , the width of the raman peaks and the corresponding vibrational frequencies are proportional to each other , with @xmath48 . only for frequencies above @xmath49",
    "do the raman widths deviate appreciably from this simple relationship .      in order to investigate the dependence of the position and width of the raman peaks on the geometry of the lattice , the intensity and detuning of the lattice beams ( and hence @xmath31 )",
    "were kept fixed fixed at @xmath41 and @xmath50 , respectively , and the splitting - angle @xmath3 was varied .",

    ", @xmath3 could be varied between @xmath51 and @xmath52 degrees , which according to equations  [ eqn : omxy ] and  [ eqn : omz ] should result in a large variation in @xmath53 , but only a small variation in @xmath54 .",
    "figure  [ fig : geoposw ] ( a ) shows the results of the measurements of @xmath55 as a function of @xmath56 .",
    "as expected , there is a linear relationship , and again the experimentally measured frequencies lie about 20 percent below the theoretical values . +",
    "the measurements of the raman widths as a function of geometry are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : geoposw ] ( b ) , where @xmath57 is plotted against @xmath55 . as before , there is a linear relationship between the two , with @xmath58 . within the experimental errors",
    ", this agrees with the empirical constant of proportionality found in section  [ intdet ] .",
    "in most of the work previously carried out on the excitation modes of atoms in optical lattices , the atoms were allowed to reach equilibrium in the potential wells before measurements were performed . to demonstrate that we can use the coherent transient technique for time - resolved , high - resolution spectroscopic studies",
    ", we loaded our lattice directly from the mot , skipping the molasses phase .",
    "the temperature of the atoms released from the mot was about @xmath26 .",
    "the lattice was then switched on for a variable amount of time , after which either the temperature was measured ( using the time - of - flight method  @xcite ) , or a coherent transient spectrum was recorded in about @xmath59 .",
    "figure  [ fig : equil ] shows the results of the corresponding temperature and vibrational frequency measurements .",
    "the temperature of the atoms reaches its steady - state value governed by the lattice parameters in a few milliseconds  @xcite . at the same time , the measured vibrational frequency of the atoms increases as the atoms are cooled and then approaches as steady - state value .",
    "these results can alternatively be visualized by plotting the measured vibrational frequency against temperature ( fig .",
    "[ fig : postemp ] ) .",
    "evidently , the colder the atoms are , the higher is the observed vibrational frequency .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the anharmonicity of the lattice potential , as will be explained in more detail in section  [ anharmo ] .",
    "briefly , the hotter the atoms are , the larger the population of higher - lying ( and more anharmonically shifted ) vibrational states in the potential wells will be , which results in a lower observed vibrational frequency .",
    "as mentioned before , whereas the dependence of the vibrational frequencies on the lattice parameters is well understood and can be theoretically modelled , the widths of the raman peaks of the spectra have so far resisted a comprehensive explanation . in this section",
    ", we shall summarize the models proposed so far and discuss them in the light of our findings . also , we give a brief overview of the results obtained by other groups and compare them to our own experimental results .",
    "+ the first rate to consider when dealing with the lifetimes of vibrational levels in optical lattices and coherences between those levels is the photon scattering rate @xmath60 . after the first observation of distinct raman resonances in probe - absorption spectra",
    "it was soon realized that the lifetimes could not be determined by @xmath61 since that would have meant that ( for most experimental parameters ) the resonances would not have been resolvable .",
    "the experimentally observed widths , however , were more than an order of magnitude smaller than those predicted by the photon scattering rate .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed the lamb - dicke effect  @xcite arising from sub - wavelength localization of the atoms as an explanation for the unexpected narrowness of the resonances  @xcite . according to this theory , the rate of inelastic scattering events in which the vibrational quantum number changes is reduced by the lamb - dicke factor @xmath62 in favour of elastic scattering events involving no change in vibrational level . for typical parameters ,",
    "the lamb - dicke factor is of the order of @xmath63 or less , so that the inelastic scattering rate @xmath64 comes close to the experimentally observed widths . in experiments involving shallow potentials with small lamb - dicke parameters , however , kozuma _ et al . _ still found lifetimes that were much longer than predicted by the lamb - dicke model .",
    "_ interpreted this as evidence for the existence of the transfer in inelastic scattering processes of coherence between different pairs of vibrational levels .",
    "also , results of other experiments suggested that the broadening of the vibrational raman resonances was dominated by the anharmonicity of the lattice potential , which was further demonstrated through the observation of revivals in wavepacket oscillations . in the following",
    ", we will show that our experiments support that interpretation . before discussing the experimental findings in detail ,",
    "however , we shall give a brief outline of the effects of anharmonicity in optical lattices .",
    "when deriving the expressions for the vibrational frequencies of atoms in optical lattices ( equations  [ eqn : omxy ] and  [ eqn : omz ] ) , the true light - shift potentials are often approximated by harmonic potentials characterized by the curvature of the lattice potentials close to a local minimum .",
    "the effect of the anharmonicity of the potential can be treated perturbatively by considering the correction due to the fourth - order term in the expansion of the potential in first - order perturbation theory .",
    "taking into account the geometrical factor @xmath56 characterizing the lattice constant in the @xmath12-direction , this leads to the vibrational frequency @xmath65 associated with a pair of adjacent vibrational levels characterized by @xmath66 and @xmath67 being reduced with respect to the harmonic frequency @xmath68 so that @xmath69 assuming that in an optical lattice the vibrational levels are populated according to a boltzmann distribution  @xcite , and that the ratio @xmath70 is a constant ( as has been shown experimentally  @xcite ) , the effect of the anharmonicity on the experimentally observed raman resonances can be estimated .",
    "firstly , the observed vibrational frequency can be defined as an average over all the anharmonically shifted pairs of vibrational levels , weighted by their respective boltzmann factors , leading to the following expression  @xcite : @xmath71 this indicates that all the vibrational frequencies should be reduced by a constant fraction , and that that fraction will be proportional to the temperature @xmath72 of the atoms in the lattice for a constant well - depth @xmath31 .",
    "this satisfactorily accounts for our observations presented in section  [ equili ] .",
    "+ likewise , the broadening of the resonance due to the presence of several vibrational frequencies can be modelled by assuming that only levels with a boltzmann factor ( relative to that for @xmath73 ) larger than some small , arbitrary number @xmath74 contribute appreciably to the observed spectrum . the most shifted vibrational frequency , which is a measure of the frequency spread ,",
    "is then given by @xmath75 this is proportional to the vibrational frequency @xmath68 for any value of @xmath74 , so that we would expect that the true linewidth , calculated from a properly weighted sum over all vibrational levels , also to be proportional to @xmath68 .",
    "this is precisely what we observe in our experiments .",
    "figure  [ fig : geoex ] illustrates the dependence of the vibrational frequency and width of the raman peak on the geometrical factor @xmath56 . in a more quantitative treatment , we have performed numerical simulations of the coherent transient spectra taking into account the frequency spread by superposing the contributions of all possible pairs of vibrational levels .",
    "the results exhibit the same characteristics as the qualitative models described above .",
    "+ in principle , the anharmonicity of the potential should also manifest itself in an asymmetry of the raman peak .",
    "one expects a slower drop - off of the raman peak on the low frequency side because the anharmonic shifts are all in the same direction ( see equation  [ anhshifts ] ) .",
    "this effect , however , will only be noticeable if the frequency spread due to anharmonicity is appreciable compared to the widths of the individual contributions , which are caused by the dissipative mechanisms described above . in our experiments",
    ", we have not found any clear evidence of an asymmetry of the raman peaks . in fig .",
    "[ fig : geoex ] , however , the lorentzian fit to the broader raman peak ( b ) has a larger @xmath76-value then the narrower peak ( a ) , which suggests that the former is distorted by anharmonicity .",
    "one of the main objectives of our experiments was to determine the dominant mechanism involved in determining the width of the raman resonances in the coherent transient spectra .",
    "in particular , we were interested in establishing whether the lamb - dicke model correctly predicted the dependence of the widths on all the experimental parameters . since our experiment was performed on a 3-d lattice , whereas the lamb - dicke treatment of courtois  _ et al .",
    "_ is based on calculations in one dimension , we have generalized that derivation to take into account the dependence of the lattice constant on the geometry of the lattice .",
    "this leads to the appearance of an extra geometrical factor @xmath56 in the expression for the rate @xmath77 of inelastic raman processes leading to a change in the external state of the atom along the @xmath12-direction from an initial state with vibrational quantum number , @xmath66 , which then becomes @xmath78 this reproduces the observed linear dependence of @xmath79 on @xmath80 when the splitting - angle @xmath3 is varied ( see section  [ geovar ] ) .",
    "it also turns out that when the lattice intensity is varied , the expression for @xmath81 reduces to @xmath82 .",
    "when @xmath31 is varied by changing the detuning , however , the relationship between @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( and hence @xmath79 ) is expected to be of the form @xmath83 ( for large detuning ) , which is not at all what we observe .",
    "in fact , upon closer inspection the values of @xmath79 for identical @xmath80 but different detuning do differ slightly from each other , the value of @xmath79 for the larger detuning being smaller , as expected .",
    "the difference , however , is very small and does not reflect the predicted @xmath84-dependence .",
    "this is perhaps only to be expected because , for the case of the largest detunings used in these experiments , the proximity of the neighbouring @xmath85 transition means that our approximation of an isolated transition is of dubious validity .",
    "nevertheless , we find that the observed dependence of @xmath79 on @xmath80 agrees very well with broadening due to anharmonicity , as derived above .",
    "these observations suggest that the main broadening mechanism is , indeed , the anharmonicity of the potential , and the dissipative mechanisms based on inelastic photon scattering are strongly suppressed . in the harmonic limit ,",
    "where the homogeneous width is small compared to the anharmonic frequency difference between successive vibrational levels , the suppression of line - broadening because of the transfer of vibrational coherence  @xcite between pairs of levels in spontaneous raman processes is expected to be appreciable .",
    "the lifetimes of the vibrational coherences are then determined by the cooling rate , rather than by the inelastic photon scattering rate , which in the oscillating regime is given by @xmath86  @xcite and , in our experiments varies between @xmath87 for small detuning to less than @xmath88 for the largest detuning employed . for large detuning ,",
    "the associated width is given by @xmath89 .",
    "conversely , in the anharmonic limit , it is the spatial localization that is expected to give rise to the suppression of inelastic raman processes . clearly , the interplay between the transfer of coherence , the lamb - dicke narrowing and the line broadening mechanisms is hard to model quantitatively for an intermediate case .",
    "nevertheless , our results strongly suggest that the broadening associated with the anharmonicity generally dominates the widths of the raman peaks , with dissipative mechanisms contributing at a much reduced level .",
    "we used the method of coherent transients in order to measure the vibrational frequencies of atoms in optical lattices and the widths associated with the corresponding raman peaks of the coherent transient spectra . varying the intensity , detuning , and geometry of the lattices beam",
    ", we confirmed the validity of the theoretical predictions for the vibrational frequencies based on a harmonic oscillator model of the potential wells .",
    "our measurements of the raman widths as a function of intensity , detuning , and geometry all yielded a linear dependence on the vibrational frequencies , which strongly suggests that anharmonicity is the main broadening mechanism .",
    "this implies that the decay of the coherence between adjacent vibrational levels is suppressed , which we ascribe to the combined effects of the transfer of coherence between pairs of vibrational levels in inelastic raman processes and the suppression of the inelastic rate arising from the sub - optical wavelength spatial localization .",
    "the anharmonicity was also found to be responsible for a reduction in the observed vibrational frequencies relative to the predictions of a harmonic model , which was tested by measuring the vibrational frequencies of ensembles of atoms with different temperatures in otherwise identical optical lattices .",
