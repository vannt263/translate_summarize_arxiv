    "blazars are radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , including bl lacertae objects ( bl lac objects ) and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) , characterized with some special observational features , such as luminous nonthermal continuum emission from radio up to gev / tev energies , rapid variability with large amplitudes , and superluminal motion of their compact radio cores ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these unusual characteristics originate from the doppler boosted emission of a relativistic jet with a small angle to the line of sight @xcite .",
    "the intranight or intraday variability ( idv ) is an intrinsic phenomenon , and tightly constrain the diameters of the emitting regions in blazars @xcite .",
    "the emitting region in the relativistic jet is usually simplified as a blob .",
    "the size @xmath3 of blob can be limited by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the doppler factor of jet , @xmath6 is the observed timescale of variations , @xmath7 is the redshift of source , and @xmath8 is the speed of light .",
    "the idv limit @xmath3 to be smaller than the size of solar system by @xmath9 1 day in the source rest frame .",
    "these timescales of the variations with large amplitudes in the optical  gamma - ray bands might have some underlying connection with the black hole masses of the central engines in blazars .",
    "the relativistic jets can be generated from inner accretion disk in the vicinity of black hole ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observations show that dips in the x - ray emission , generated in the central engines , are followed by ejections of bright superluminal radio knots in the jets of agns and microquasars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the dips in the x - ray emission are well correlated with the ejections of bright superluminal knots in the radio jets of 3c 120 @xcite and 3c 111 @xcite .",
    "an instability in accretion flow may cause a section of the inner disk break off , and the loss of this section leads to a decrease in the soft x - ray flux , observed as a dip in the x - ray emission .",
    "a fraction of the section is accreted into the event horizon of the centra black hole",
    ". a considerable portion of the section is ejected into the jet , observed as the appearance of a superluminal bright knot .",
    "general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations showed production of relativistic jets in the vicinity of black hole with jet - production region around 78@xmath10 for the schwarzchild black hole and being of the order of the radius of the ergosphere @xmath11 for the kerr black hole , where @xmath10 is the gravitational radius of black hole @xcite .",
    "for the schwarzchild black hole , the inner radius of the accretion disk is about equal to that of the marginally stable orbit 6@xmath10 , which is comparable to the size of the jet - production region .",
    "thus the initial size of a blob emerged from the jet - production region may be comparable to that of the marginally stable orbit or that of the ergosphere",
    ". the blob will expand as it travels outward along the jet .",
    "when the blob pass the site of dissipation region in the jet , it will produce the corresponding variations in the optical  gamma - ray regimes .",
    "the minimum timescales of the variations are likely to be related with the masses of the central black holes .",
    "then the black hole masses @xmath0 can be constrained with the observed minimum timescales @xmath12 of variations in the optical  gamma - ray regimes . in this paper",
    ", we attempt to construct a model that constrains @xmath0 with @xmath13 for blazars .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 presents method .",
    "section 3 presents applications .",
    "section 4 is for discussion and conclusions .",
    "assuming the blob has a size of @xmath14 in the jet - production region ( with a size comparable to @xmath14 ) , and a size of @xmath15 at the location @xmath16 in the jet from the central engine ( see figure 1 ) , we have an equation between @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the average expansion velocity of blob in the jet between the central engine and the location @xmath16 , and @xmath19 is the corresponding average bulk velocity of the blob .",
    "the jet velocity @xmath19 is in a relativistic region .",
    "the expansion velocity @xmath18 is not in a relativistic region .",
    "then @xmath20 , and we have @xmath21    the size @xmath15 of a blob at the location @xmath16 can be constrained by the observed minimum timescale @xmath13 of the variations from the blob , and we have @xmath22 where @xmath5 is the doppler factor , @xmath7 is the redshift of source , and @xmath8 is the light speed . combining equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 )",
    ", we have @xmath23    the inner radius of accretion disk is usually taken to be around the marginally stable orbit of disk surrounding the central black hole .",
    "the radius of marginally stable orbit of disk is @xmath24^{1/2}\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the gravitational radius of black hole with a mass of @xmath0 , @xmath26 $ ] , and @xmath27 @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath28 is the dimensionless spin parameter of black hole with the maximum possible angular momentum @xmath29 with @xmath30 being the gravitational constant . in the case of the prograde rotation , @xmath31 for @xmath32 and @xmath33 for @xmath34 .",
    "general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations show that in the schwarzchild case the jet - production region has a size around 1416@xmath10 @xcite , comparable to the diameter of the marginally stable orbit , @xmath35 . in the kerr case ,",
    "the jet - production region must be of the order of the diameter of the ergosphere @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the equatorial boundary of the ergosphere @xcite . thus the jet - production region span about from @xmath38 to @xmath39 for @xmath40 , and then we take @xmath41412@xmath10 . from equation ( 4 ) and",
    "@xmath41412@xmath10 , we have    @xmath42    where @xmath12 is in units of seconds . equations ( 6a ) and ( 6b ) can be unified as @xmath43",
    "the new method is applied to 32 blazars .",
    "these blazars have variability timescales of the order of hours with large variability amplitudes and a redshift range from 0.031 to 1.813 .",
    "these timescales were reported in the literatures for the optical  x - ray  gamma - ray bands .",
    "the satellites detected gev gamma rays from 29 out of 32 blazars .",
    "the details of these blazars are presented in table 1 .",
    "the minimum timescales of gamma rays are taken to be the doubling times of fluxes .",
    "the optical minimum timescales were reported in the literatures presented in column ( 6 ) of table 1 .",
    "the doubling times of x - ray fluxes are taken as the x - ray minimum timescales .",
    "these observed minimum timescales are listed in column ( 4 ) , and their corresponding references are presented in column ( 6 ) .",
    "the optical@xmath44-ray emission are mostly the doppler boosted emission of jets for gamma - ray blazars @xcite .",
    "a value of @xmath45 10 was adopted for gev gamma - ray blazars @xcite",
    ". we will take @xmath46 to estimate @xmath0 with formula ( 7 ) .",
    "the schwarzchild and kerr black holes are considered in estimates of @xmath0 from formula ( 7 ) .",
    "the estimated black hole masses are denoted by @xmath47 and @xmath48 in columns ( 7 ) and ( 8) of table 1 , respectively . in the schwarzchild case",
    ", @xmath48 spans from @xmath49 to @xmath50 @xmath51 . in the kerr case",
    ", @xmath47 spans from @xmath52 to @xmath53 @xmath51 .",
    "we compared these estimated @xmath48 to those masses @xmath54 obtained with other methods reported in the literatures . in figure 2 of @xmath54 versus @xmath48 , there are five blazars below the line of @xmath55 . because @xmath48 is only an upper limit of @xmath0 , the area below this line is not allowed for these blazars . when the central black holes are the kerr ones , these upper limits of masses are increased by a factor 3 , and four out of five blazars are moved into the area above the line of @xmath55 .",
    "only 4c + 38.41 is just below the line of @xmath55 .",
    "the populations of @xmath0 in figure 2 show that these @xmath56 estimated from formula ( 7 ) are reasonable upper limits on @xmath0 for blazars .",
    "@xcite thought x - ray emission to be produced very close to the inner engine in bl lacertae object pks 2155 - 304 .",
    "@xcite limited the doppler factor by the black hole mass and the variability timescale of very high energy gamma - ray flare of pks 2155 - 304 .",
    "@xcite reported the rapid variations on timescale as short as 1.5 hours for bl lacertae in the optical flux , and the minimum timescale for the variations was used to place constraints on the size of the emitting region .",
    "they assumed that these variations were produced in the vicinity of a supermassive black hole , and then determined a black hole mass with the minimum timescale from a formula @xmath57 for the schwarzchild black hole . at that time",
    ", they thought that relativistic beaming need not be invoked to account for the luminosity of this object .",
    "for the kerr black hole , @xcite deduced a formula from @xcite @xmath58 which gives an upper limit on @xmath0 .",
    "these above two equations are based on assumption of accretion disk surrounding a supermassive black hole , and the optical flux variations are from the accretion disk .",
    "obviously , these two formulae are applicable to estimate @xmath0 for non - blazar - like agns or some agns with weaker blazar emission component in fluxes relative to accretion disk emission component .",
    "considering the relativistic beaming effect , @xcite deduced a new formula from formula ( 9 ) @xmath59 formula ( 10 ) was applied to blazars , especially bl lac objects ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this paper",
    ", we proposed a sophisticated model to constrain the black hole masses using the rapid variations with large amplitudes for blazars .",
    "the model is suitable to constrain @xmath0 in blazars using the minimum timescales of variations of the beamed emission from the relativistic jet .",
    "formula ( 7 ) is the same as formula ( 10 ) in except of the coefficients in the right of formulae , but these two corresponding models are essentially different in their origins .",
    "spectral energy distributions of blazars consist of two broad peaks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the first peak is produced by the synchrotron radiation processes of relativistic electrons in a relativistic jet .",
    "the second one is generally believed to come from the inverse compton scattering processes of the same population of electrons . in general , the optical  gamma - ray emission are believed and/or assumed to be produced in the same region , simplified as a blob in simulating the spectral energy distributions of blazars .",
    "the coincidence of a gamma - ray flare with a dramatic change of optical polarization angle provides evidence for co - spatiality of optical and gamma - ray emission regions in 3c 279 @xcite .",
    "thus the timescales of the optical  x - ray  gamma - ray variations are used in formula ( 7 ) . for this model , the blob size is assumed to increase linearly as it travels outward along the jet ( see equation ( 1 ) ) .",
    "this linear growth assumption is only an approximation to the actual growth .",
    "the assumption will not change formula ( 2 ) , and then do nt alter formula ( 7 ) .",
    "the errors associated with this method are quite high . besides the poorly known details of the model itself , related to our ignorance of the exact distance from the black hole where the emission is produced , a large uncertainty is related to the value of the adopted doppler factor .",
    "a value of @xmath60 is assumed , which may be in excess or short of the real value by at least a factor 3 , resulting in a total uncertainty of at least an order of magnitude .",
    "in fact , it is possible for 32 blazars listed in table 1 .",
    "the doppler factor @xmath5 can be estimated from the lorentz factor and the viewing angle of jet adopted to model spectral energy distributions of bright _ fermi _ blazars in @xcite .",
    "there are 21 _ fermi _ blazars with new estimated @xmath5 , and these new @xmath5 are from 13 to 28 with an average of 17 .",
    "so , the upper limits of black hole masses are increased by a factor 1.32.8 when adopting these new @xmath5 for the 21 blazars .",
    "thus the 29 _ fermi _ blazars out of 32 blazars we employed will have a similar case for the upper limits of black hole masses",
    ". the adopted doppler factor of @xmath46 may result in a large uncertainty with a factor 1.32.8 in the upper limits of @xmath0 .",
    "another larger uncertainty with a factor 3.0 arises from the ignorance of spins of the central black holes in blazars ( see formulae ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) ) . thus the two large uncertainties will lead to errors of 3.98.4 in the upper limits of @xmath0 estimated with this method for blazars .    in this paper",
    ", we proposed a sophisticated model to constrain the central black hole masses @xmath0 with the observed minimum timescales @xmath2 of variations in blazars .",
    "the size of a blob in the relativistic jet can be constrained with @xmath2 .",
    "the blob is assumed to be ejected from the jet - production region in the vicinity of black hole , and then to expand linearly as it travels outward along the jet .",
    "the model is applied to 32 blazars , out of which 29 blazars were detected in the gev gamma - ray regime with the satellites .",
    "their observed minimum timescales are on the order of hours with large variability amplitudes in the optical  x - ray  gamma - ray bands . in general , these @xmath0 estimated from @xmath2 by formula ( 7 ) are not inconsistent with those masses reported in the literatures .",
    "this indicates that this model is applicable to constrain @xmath0 in the central engines of blazars .",
    "this model is more natural to connect @xmath0 with @xmath1 for blazars . due to the ignorance of the black hole spins and the real doppler factors ,",
    "the uncertainty of the upper limits of masses will be about 3.98.4 in this method .",
    "the upper limits of masses will have uncertainty of 3.0 because the black hole spins are unknown for blazars , though we have the real doppler factors rather than the adopted value of @xmath61 in this paper .",
