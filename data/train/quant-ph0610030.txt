    "classical information theory is typically concerned with _",
    "fungible information _ ,",
    "that is , information for which the means of encoding is not important .",
    "shannon s coding theorems , for instance , are indifferent to whether the two values `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' of a classical bit correspond to two values of magnetization on a tape , two voltages on a transmission line , or two positions of a bead on an abacus .",
    "most information - processing tasks of interest to computer scientists and information theorists are of this sort , whether they be communication tasks such as data compression , cryptographic tasks such as key distribution , or computational tasks such as factoring . nonetheless , there are many tasks that can not be achieved with fungible information but that are also aptly described as `` information processing '' tasks .",
    "examples include the synchronization of distant clocks , the alignment of distant cartesian frames , and the determination of one s global position .",
    "imagine for instance that alice and bob are in separate spaceships with no shared cartesian frame ( in particular , no access to the fixed stars ) .",
    "there is clearly no way for alice to _ describe _ a direction in space to bob abstractly , that is , using nothing more than a string of classical bits .",
    "rather , she must send to bob a system that can point in some direction , a token of one of the axes of her own cartesian frame .",
    "this token can not be spherically symmetric ; it must have a degree of freedom that can encode directional information . on the other hand ,",
    "if she wishes to synchronize her clock with bob s by sending him a token system , she will need to make use of a system that has a natural oscillation .",
    "the information that is communicated in these sorts of tasks is said to be _ nonfungible_. these two sorts of information , fungible and nonfungible , have also been referred to as _",
    "speakable _ and _ unspeakable _  @xcite .",
    "the relatively young field of quantum information theory has been primarily concerned with developing a quantum theory of speakable information .",
    "investigators have sought to determine the degree of success with which various abstract information - processing tasks can be achieved assuming that the systems used to implement these tasks obey the laws of quantum theory .",
    "nonetheless , there has also been progress in developing a quantum theory of _ unspeakable _ information , outlining , for instance , the success with which tasks such as clock synchronization and cartesian frame alignment can be achieved in a quantum world .",
    "that one must look to physics to answer questions of interest to computer scientists is a fact that has not always been obvious .",
    "( @xcite summarized this point in the slogan , `` information is physical '' . ) that one must look to physics to answers questions about the processing of unspeakable information , on the other hand , comes as no surprise .",
    "nonetheless , the _ quantum _ theory of unspeakable information is only just beginning to be explored .",
    "it is critical to note that when one has a system encoding directional information , such as a spin-1/2 particle in a pure state , the direction is not defined with respect to any purported absolute newtonian space , but rather with respect to another system , for instance , a set of gyroscopes in the laboratory .",
    "similarly , a system that contains phase information , such as a two - level atom in a coherent superposition of ground and excited states , is not defined relative to any purported absolute time , but rather relative to a clock .",
    "we refer to the systems with respect to which unspeakable / nonfungible information is defined , clocks , gyroscopes , metre sticks and so forth , as _ reference frames_. the tasks we have highlighted thus far can all be described as the alignment of reference frames .",
    "nonfungible information is nonfungible precisely because it can only be defined with respect to a particular type of reference frame .",
    "even a quantum information theorist who is uninterested in tasks such as clock synchronization and cartesian frame alignment must necessarily consider physical systems which make use of reference frames .",
    "the reason is that although fungible information can be encoded into _ any _ degree of freedom , and thus defined with respect to _ any _ reference frame , it is still the case that _ some _ degree of freedom must be chosen , and consequently _ some _ reference frame is required .",
    "for instance , if a two - level atomic qubit is being used for some task , one still requires a clock in the background in order to implement arbitrary preparations and measurements on this qubit even if the task is to perform abstract quantum information - processing rather than as a means of distributing phase information . in this example , one can change the relative phase between the ground and excited states of a two - level atom by a specified amount by turning on a static electric field for a specific time interval , but this requires a suitably precise clock as well as alignment of the field with the atomic dipole moment .",
    "it follows that to _ lack _ a reference frame for a particular degree of freedom has an impact on the success with which one can perform certain quantum information processing tasks . on several occasions",
    "there has been considerable controversy over the performance of certain tasks because this impact was ignored , or not treated properly .",
    "as we will see , the lack of a reference frame can be treated within the quantum formalism as a form of _ decoherence _  quantum noise .",
    "as opposed to the typical source of decoherence , which is due to correlation with an environment to which one does not have access , this decoherence can be viewed as resulting from correlation with a ( possibly hypothetical ) reference frame to which one does not have access .",
    "this is a powerful result , because if the lack of a reference frame can be viewed as a form of decoherence , the now - standard techniques of combating decoherence in quantum information theory ( in particular , the use of _ decoherence - free subsystems _ ) can be applied .",
    "as it turns out , the restriction of lacking a reference frame is mathematically equivalent to that of so - called _ superselection rules _  postulated rules forbidding the preparation of quantum states that exhibit coherence between eigenstates of certain observables .",
    "originally , superselection rules were introduced to enforce additional constraints to quantum theory beyond the well - studied constraints of selection rules ( conservation laws ) .",
    "they were considered to be axiomatic restrictions , applying to only certain degrees of freedom .",
    "for instance , a superselection rule for electric charge asserts the impossibility of preparing a coherent superposition of different charge eigenstates . as we shall see , however , for superselection rules associated with compact symmetry groups , the presence of appropriate reference frames can actually allow for the preparation of such superposition states , thereby obviating the superselection rules in practice .",
    "this shows that there is an intimate connection between the restriction of lacking a reference frame and that of a superselection rule .",
    "as  @xcite has emphasized , interesting restrictions on experimental operations yield interesting information theories .",
    "for instance , the fact that classical channels and local operations are a cheap resource compared to quantum channels leads us to study what can be achieved with local operations and classical communication ( locc ) .",
    "the resulting information theory is the theory of entanglement . as another example , the relative ease with which one can implement gaussian operations in quantum optics leads one to consider the information theory that results from the restriction to these operations . by comparing and contrasting the information theories that result from various different restrictions we are led to a much broader perspective on all of them .",
    "in particular , analogies between the resulting theories allow us to apply the insights gained in the context of one to solve problems arising in the context of another . in this sense , studying the restriction of a superselection rule  or equivalently , as we shall demonstrate , the restriction of lacking a reference frame  may yield lessons for the rest of quantum information theory .    in some cases , it is difficult to imagine lacking a reference frame .",
    "for example , cartesian frames with precision on the order of fractions of a degree and clocks with precision on the order of fractions of a second are sufficiently ubiquitous that their presence typically does not even warrant mention .",
    "however , these same reference frames become quite difficult to prepare and maintain if one requires very high precision or very good stability .",
    "furthermore , there are certain kinds of reference frames that are difficult to prepare even if one requires only low precision and poor stability . for instance",
    ", a bose - einstein condensate of alkali atoms can act as a reference frame for the phase that is conjugate to atom number , and the reliable preparation of these has only been achieved in the past decade . in addition , it is straightforward to imagine two parties with reference frames that are uncorrelated ( such as the example of the space - faring alice and bob provided earlier ) . in this case",
    "we say that they lack a _ shared _ reference frame .",
    "all of these facts demonstrate that reference frames must be considered as _",
    "resources_.    regardless of the degree of freedom in question , a reference frame is always associated with some physical system . as such , it may be treated within the formalism of quantum mechanics . in this case",
    ", we speak of _ quantum reference frames_. indeed , one can imagine an extreme case wherein the only system in a party s possession that plays the role of a reference frame ( or plays the role of a shared reference frame with another party ) is of bounded size .",
    "for instance , one can imagine a quantum clock consisting of an oscillator with a small maximum number of excitations , or a quantum gyroscope consisting of a handful of spin-1/2 systems .",
    "it is then natural to ask how well such a bounded - size reference frame approximates one that is of unbounded size .",
    "the ability of a bounded reference frame to stand in for an unbounded reference frame is analogous to the ability of an entangled state to stand in for the possibility of implementing non - local operations .",
    "recall that the teleportation protocol permits entanglement and classical communication to substitute for a non - local operation .",
    "more generally , when one lacks the ability to perform non - local operations ( such as when qubits are remotely separated ) , entanglement becomes a quantifiable resource .",
    "similarly , when one is subject to a superselection rule ( i.e. , when one lacks a reference frame for some degree of freedom ) bounded reference frames become a quantifiable resource about which we can ask the same sorts of questions as we do for entanglement .",
    "for instance , we may ask the following questions : which states are interconvertible ?",
    "how many states of a standard form can be distilled from a given state and how many are required to form a given state ? how much of the resource is required for a given task ?",
    "how quickly is it used up ? etc .    finally , because it is all too easy to forget about the presence of reference frames , these are at the root of various conceptual confusions .",
    "these include : the interpretation of quantum states exhibiting coherence between number states in a single mode ( a subject of controversy in quantum optics , bose - einstein condensation and superconductivity ) ; the quantification of entanglement in systems of bosons or fermions , or in situations when operations are restricted ; the efficiency with which frames may be aligned , clocks synchronized , etc . ; and the significance of superselection rules on the possibility of implementing various quantum information processing tasks .    in this article",
    ", we provide a review of the recent investigations into these and related issues . in sec .",
    "[ sec : formal ] , we introduce the formalism for treating the lack of a general reference frame in quantum theory , and show how this is equivalent to a superselection rule .",
    "[ sec : nosrf ] considers quantum information processing without a shared reference frame .",
    "[ sec : qrfs ] considers how to treat reference frames within the quantum formalism , which provides the starting point for a theory of distributing quantum reference frames  the topic of sec .",
    "[ sec : aligning ] .",
    "the effect of bounding the size of reference frames for quantum information processing is considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : boundedrfs ] .",
    "finally , we provide an outlook to the future of this field in sec .",
    "[ sec : outlook ] .",
    "reference frames ( rfs ) are implicit in the definition of quantum states .",
    "for example , in the position representation of the wavefunction of a quantum particle , @xmath0 , @xmath1 parameterizes the position of the particle relative to a spatial reference frame .",
    "more generally , the quantum state of a system is a description of the system relative to a suitable reference frame .",
    "consider a quantum system with hilbert space @xmath2 , prepared in a state @xmath3 relative to a reference frame .",
    "we can now consider a transformation that changes this relation .",
    "such a transformation can be _ active _ , changing the system such that it subsequently holds a different relation to the reference frame , or _",
    "passive _ , in which case the system is unchanged but is now described relative to a new reference frame . in both situations ,",
    "the transformation can be represented by a unitary operator , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 denotes the transformation ; the transformed system is then described by the state @xmath6 . note that these operations can be composed , so that @xmath7 is a transformation if both @xmath8 and @xmath4 are , and this composition is associative ( i.e. , @xmath9 ) .",
    "also , there exists an _ inverse _",
    "transformation @xmath10 to every transformation @xmath4 , such that @xmath11 , the identity . if this inverse is unique , . ]",
    "the set of all transformations form a group @xmath12 .",
    "we use @xmath13 to denote an abstract transformation within the group , and say that @xmath14 is the _ unitary representation _ of this group on the quantum system ( or equivalently , on the hilbert space @xmath2 ) .    in this review",
    ", we will often use two common examples of a reference frame to illustrate the concepts and ideas we cover .",
    "the first example is a _ phase reference _ , for which the relevant group of transformations is u(1 ) , the group of real numbers modulo @xmath15 under addition .",
    "a representation of u(1 ) on a quantum system determines how that system transforms under phase shifts .",
    "the second example that we use extensively in this review is a _",
    "cartesian frame _ specifying three orthogonal spatial directions ; the group of transformations of orientation relative to a cartesian frame is the group of rotations so(3 ) .",
    "an element @xmath16 so(3 ) can be given , say , by a set of three euler angles .",
    "the representation of so(3 ) on a quantum system , then , determines how that system transforms under rotations ; for example , a spin-@xmath17 particle transforms according to the unitary representation @xmath18 ( a wigner rotation matrix ) .",
    "we will often extend the group of rotations so(3 ) to the group su(2 ) to allow for spinor representations .",
    "because group theory provides a powerful mathematical tool for analyzing the role of reference frames in quantum systems , we will make frequent use of group theoretic techniques throughout this review .",
    "we present a short introduction to the relevant techniques in this section , but the reader may wish to consult a standard group theory text , such as  @xcite or @xcite , for further details . also , for an introduction to the standard mathematical techniques of quantum information , we direct the reader to  @xcite .",
    "we begin by exploring an illustrative example .      in this section",
    ", we investigate an explicit example of a reference frame  a phase reference  and demonstrate that if one _ lacks _ a phase reference then the resulting quantum theory is equivalent to one in which there is a superselection rule for photon number .    in quantum optical experiments , states of an optical mode",
    "are always referred to some phase reference .",
    "consider @xmath19 optical modes as described by some party , alice , relative to a phase reference in her possession  for example , a high intensity laser .",
    "let @xmath20 be the fock state basis for the hilbert space @xmath21 describing these modes , with @xmath22 the number of photons in the mode @xmath23 , and @xmath24 the number operator for this mode .",
    "consider another party , charlie , who has a different phase reference .",
    "let @xmath25 be the angle that relates charlie s phase reference to alice s .",
    "alice can perform an _ active _ transformation on her system of optical modes by allowing them to evolve under a hamiltonian proportional to @xmath26 , the total photon number operator .",
    "specifically , the unitary transformation @xmath27 will actively advance her system by an angle @xmath25 . using the equivalence between the representations for active and passive transformations ,",
    "we thus conclude that states prepared by alice are represented by charlie relative to his phase reference by performing a passive transformation of @xmath25 , using the representation @xmath28 of u(1 ) on @xmath19 modes given by @xmath27 .",
    "if @xmath29 is the state relative to alice s phase reference , then this same state relative to charlie s phase reference is given by the transformed state @xmath30    for example , let alice prepare the single - mode coherent state @xmath31 with @xmath32 ; this state has a phase @xmath33 relative to alice s phase reference .",
    "charlie would describe this same state relative to his phase reference by a coherent state with the same amplitude but with phase @xmath34 .",
    "this passive transformation agrees with that of eq .   because @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the number operator on this single mode .",
    "as another example , let alice prepare the two - mode state @xmath37 . because this state is an eigenstate of @xmath38 , the transformation @xmath39 induces only an unobservable overall phase when acting on this state .",
    "thus , charlie also represents the state of the system as @xmath37 relative to his phase reference .",
    "this two - mode state is an example of an invariant state ; it is defined independently of any phase reference .",
    "it will be useful for us to decompose the hilbert space @xmath21 of @xmath19 modes into subspaces that transform in a simple way under the action of the group u(1 ) , as follows .",
    "defining @xmath40 to be the hilbert space consisting of states of @xmath19 modes with precisely @xmath41 total photons , i.e. , eigenspaces of @xmath38 with eigenvalue @xmath41 , we can express the hilbert space @xmath21 as a _ direct sum _ @xmath42 any state @xmath43 transforms under phase shifts , i.e. , under the representation @xmath28 of u(1 ) , as @xmath44 define @xmath45 to be the projector onto @xmath40 .",
    "then an arbitrary state @xmath46 transforms as @xmath47    now consider the situation where charlie has no knowledge of the angle @xmath25 that relates his phase references to alice s , i.e. , the laser serving as his phase reference is not phase - locked to hers . a function of time .",
    "given that this function is known , the parties can compensate for this effect .",
    "however , a lack of knowledge of how this phase is changing , for instance , an unknown drift , can eventually lead to alice and charlie having no information about the relative phase between their references .",
    "in such a situation , the timescale of the drift relative to the operations they perform is critical ; a slow drift may have negligible effect on a quick protocol . ]",
    "let alice prepare a quantum state @xmath29 of @xmath19 modes relative to her phase reference .",
    "given that @xmath25 is completely unknown , one must average over its possible values to obtain the state relative to charlie .",
    "this averaging yields the _ mixed _ state @xmath48    \\equiv \\int_0^{2\\pi } \\frac{{\\rm d}\\phi}{2\\pi}\\ ,    u(\\phi)|\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi| u(\\phi)^\\dag \\,.\\ ] ] using eq .",

    "this restriction is characterized by the quantum operation @xmath50 , which ensures that charlie will describe any state prepared by alice as block - diagonal in total photon number , or equivalently , as invariant under phase shifts .",
    "we note in particular that the only pure states that alice can prepare are those which lie entirely within a single eigenspace @xmath40 .    now consider the related question for operations : if a unitary operation @xmath55 is performed by alice relative to her phase reference ,",
    "how is this operation described by charlie relative to his phase reference ?",
    "let @xmath56 be the state of the system relative to charlie s phase reference .",
    "to describe the action of @xmath55 on this state if the angle @xmath25 that relates charlie s phase reference to alice s is _ known _ , charlie could transform this state into alice s frame , then apply the unitary @xmath55 , then transform back to his frame ; the resulting state is @xmath57 relative to charlie .",
    "thus , the operation is described by charlie by the unitary @xmath58 .",
    "if the phase @xmath25 is _ unknown _ , then charlie would instead describe the operation by an incoherent mixture of unitaries of this form , i.e. , by the map @xmath59      \\equiv \\int_0^{2\\pi } \\frac{{\\rm d}\\phi}{2\\pi}\\ ,      u(\\phi)v u(\\phi)^\\dag \\sigma u(\\phi)v^\\dag u(\\phi)^\\dag \\,.\\ ] ] a notable special case is if the system was prepared by alice , so that the state @xmath56 relative to charlie s rf is of the form @xmath60 $ ] as in eq .  .",
    "in this case , @xmath61                  & = \\mathcal{u}[v \\sigma v^{\\dag}]\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that @xmath62 $ ] is also block - diagonal in total photon number .",
    "thus , if operations are described relative to charlie s phase reference , then alice experiences a restriction on what operations she can perform .",
    "we note that a restriction that requires states to be block - diagonal in the eigenspaces of some operator is common in quantum theory : it is formally equivalent to a _ superselection rule _ ( ssr )  @xcite",
    ". many superselection rules in non - relativistic quantum theory , such as the superselection rule for charge  @xcite , are characterized by an inability to prepare states with coherence between eigenspaces of some `` charge operator '' corresponding to different eigenvalues .",
    "thus , we can refer to the restriction described above as a superselection rule for photon number  @xcite .",
    "alice can not prepare , say , a coherent state @xmath63 relative to charlie s phase reference , but she can prepare a phase - invariant state such as @xmath37 .",
    "in addition , she can not perform the unitary displacement operation that takes the vacuum @xmath64 to a coherent state @xmath63 , but she can perform any unitary operation on the two - dimensional subspace spanned by @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "we note that in the present context the ssr only restricts preparations and operations _ by alice _ ( or any party who does not share charlie s phase reference ) .",
    "the ssr does not forbid states with coherence between different total photon - number eigenstates from existing within the theory , and in particular , charlie ( or any party who _ does _ share charlie s phase reference ) experiences no such restriction on what states he can prepare .",
    "thus , it makes sense within this context to consider what manipulations alice can perform under the restriction of an ssr on general ( possibly coherent ) states .",
    "for example , alice can perform the relative phase shift which takes the state @xmath67 to @xmath68 .",
    "also , we note that alice is able to ( incoherently ) change the total photon number , i.e. , she can perform an operation that maps the vacuum @xmath64 to the single - photon state @xmath69 .",
    "thus , this restriction is not equivalent to a conservation law for photon number .      in this section ,",
    "we consider how to generalize the basic idea of the previous section  that lacking a reference frame leads to a superselection rule  beyond the case of a phase reference .",
    "we present some formal mathematical tools , in particular , tools from group theory and linear algebra , that we will use throughout this review paper .",
    "suppose two parties , alice and charlie , are considering a single quantum system described by a hilbert space @xmath2 .",
    "let this system transform via a group @xmath12 relative to some reference frame . throughout this review",
    ", we will consider both finite groups and continuous ( lie ) groups .",
    "for the latter , we will restrict our attention to lie groups that ( _ i _ ) are compact , so that they possess a group - invariant ( haar ) measure @xmath70 ; and ( _ ii _ ) act on @xmath2 via a _ unitary _",
    "representation @xmath14 , ensuring that they are completely reducible  @xcite .",
    "many of the techniques in this review can be applied to other groups with some modification , but there are many technical difficulties which are beyond the scope of this review .",

    "another common implementation for this encoding is for @xmath180 and @xmath181 to represent the two polarization modes of the single photon ( for example , horizontal and vertical polarization )  a so - called `` polarization encoding ''  @xcite . for alice and bob to share quantum information using such an encoding , although they do not need to share a phase reference , they _ do _ need to share a reference frame for polarization , i.e. , to agree on an axis for their polarizing materials that are used to prepare , manipulate , and measure such states .",
    "the efficiencies of general schemes for transmitting quantum information via the polarization and phase of optical modes when parties do not share a reference frame for polarization have been fully characterized  @xcite .",
    "recently , optical quantum information experiments have made use of the spatial mode structure of light  @xcite ; use of this degree of freedom requires a shared reference frame for both position and orientation . using spatial modes , it is possible to restrict attention to states of a single photon with a fixed orbital angular momentum ( the standard basis for which is the laguerre - gauss - vortex modes  @xcite ) .",

    "first , private communication using a private srf is similar in some ways to private - key cryptography , specifically , the vernam cipher ( one - time pad ) .",
    "for example , the secret key in the vernam cipher can be used only once to ensure perfect security .",
    "similarly , for our communication schemes , only a single plain - text ( classical or quantum ) can be encoded using a single private srf .",
    "if the same private srf is used to encode two plain - texts , then the _ relation _ that holds between the two cipher - texts carries information about the plain - texts , and because it is possible to learn about this relation without making use of the srf , eve can obtain this information .",
    "this is akin to the fact that in our example of the classical pencil or gyroscope , eve can measure the angular separation of the two pencils .",
    "this analogy prompts us to raise and dismiss the possibility that a private srf is _ equivalent _ , as a resource , to some amount of secret key or entanglement .",

    "we return to the example of the previous section , which provides a simplified version of the controversial phenomena . recall that we also considered two distinct paradigms of description for a system @xmath383 and a phase reference @xmath384 . in the first description",

    "it is a mistake however to conclude that the two descriptions are inconsistent . as we saw in the previous subsection ,",
    "both descriptions are valid .",
    "to resolve the confusion explicitly , we elaborate on the physical interpretation of the states in these hilbert space .    in the external-@xmath384 paradigm",

    "what sets the two categories apart in practice seems to be the fact that some reference frames , such as those for spatial location or angular position , are ubiquitous , whereas others , such as a frame for the quantity conjugate to charge , tend not to arise through natural causes and are difficult to prepare and maintain .",
    "but this may be only a practical and not a fundamental difference .",
    "another motivation might be given for treating the two categories differently , specifically , that a superselection rule for linear momentum would seem to imply that objects could not be localized in space , and _ this _ , one might think , would be contrary to what is observed . however , all that is ever observed empirically is the localization of systems relative to other systems , and this is consistent with a superselection rule for total linear momentum .",
    "if one seeks to describe the entire universe quantum mechanically , as is typically done in quantum cosmology and some approaches to quantum gravity , then it is natural to assume ssrs for all global transformations , so that there is no distinction between charge and linear momentum .",

    "the canonical example is quantum teleportation , which demonstrates that one ebit ( bell pair ) of shared entanglement plus two communicated classical bits are equivalent to the communication of a single qubit . in this section ,",
    "we demonstrate that a shared reference frame is also a quantifiable resource , akin to entanglement , which allows parties to perform tasks that they were unable to perform without it , or to perform tasks more efficiently .",
    "consider the `` activation '' example of sec .",
    "[ subsec : activation ] , which involved two parties ( alice and bob ) who do not share the phase reference of a third party ( charlie ) or each other . in this context , the two - mode single - photon state @xmath1009 , where @xmath1010 described relative to charlie s phase reference , they could activate the entanglement in the former state through locc .",
    "although alice and bob do not share charlie s phase reference , clearly the state @xmath1011 provides a bounded version of it .",
    "this bounded shared phase reference can be used to activate the entanglement of the two - mode single - photon state , as can an unbounded classical shared phase reference .",
    "however , unlike the latter , the bounded shared phase reference @xmath1011 can only activate the entanglement with probability @xmath274 , and in addition , is _ consumed _ in the process ; it is a shared reference frame that can be depleted , in this case , through a single use .",
    "the state @xmath1011 can be considered an elementary unit of charlie s phase reference , much like an ebit ( a bell pair ) is considered an elementary unit of entanglement . as a result of this analogy , the state @xmath1011 has been denoted a _",
    "refbit_.    continuing this example , we note that the two - mode single - photon state @xmath1012 can also be viewed as a resource for `` activating '' another copy of this same state .",
    "( this process can alternatively be viewed as 2-copy entanglement distillation , as in sec .",
    "[ subsec : activation ] . )",
    "this state is invariant under global phase changes , and thus is completely uncorrelated with charlie s ( or any other party s ) phase reference , but it nevertheless provides a bounded version of a _ shared _ phase reference for alice and bob . it is useful to view this state as the elementary unit of a shared phase reference between alice and bob , uncorrelated with any other .    because of the dual purpose of this state  either as as an elementary unit of a shared phase reference , or as a state from which entanglement can be activated with the use of a shared phase reference  it has been named and categorized in many different ways depending on its intended use .",
    "so which way should it be viewed ?",
    "the answer is that this state can serve as a resource for _ both _ entanglement and a shared reference frame , and that one must trade off its usefulness for one purpose against the other .",
    "in fact , a wide variety of tradeoffs between refbits , ebits , cbits , and other resources can be derived  @xcite , which emphasizes the utility of thinking of reference frames as yet another form of resource .",
    "now that we have identified `` standard '' elementary unit(s ) of a shared reference frame , we can quantify how well a given quantum state serves as a shared reference frame by the state s asymptotic interconvertibility to this standard form , using local operations and classical communication .",
    "a remarkable property of entanglement of pure bipartite states is that , by observing the properties of asymptotically reversible transformations using locc , entanglement can be quantified by a single additive measure : the reversible conversion efficiency to a standard form of entanglement , the ebit . for an abelian superselection rule",
    ", the resource of a quantum shared reference frame can be quantified by a single additive measure in a similar fashion .",
    "thus , the nonlocal properties of pure bipartite quantum states in the presence of an abelian superselection rule are completely characterized by two additive measures : the entanglement ( for which we can use an operational measure such as @xmath1013 , the entanglement in the presence of a ssr , discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsubsec : quantent ] ) and another measure quantifying the state s ability to serve as a shared rf . in the following ,",
    "we investigate one such measure for the latter , the _ superselection induced variance _ ( siv )  @xcite .",
    "we note that measures for quantifying quantum shared rfs in the presence of _ non - abelian _ superselection rules have not been explored to date .",
    "let alice and bob each have in their possession a number of optical modes , and consider a situation as in sec .",
    "[ sec : optics ] where they do not share a phase reference .",
    "thus , alice and bob are restricted by an abelian local superselection rule for photon number .",
    "let @xmath1014 ( @xmath1015 ) be the local hilbert space for alice s ( bob s ) modes , and @xmath1016 ( @xmath1017 ) be the total local photon number operator for these modes .",
    "consider a bipartite quantum state @xmath1018 on @xmath1019 that is an eigenstate of total photon number @xmath1020 .",
    "( this condition ensures that the state is not correlated with another party s phase reference . ) the superselection induced variance @xmath1021 of this state is defined to be the variance in the local photon number @xmath1022 this siv satisfies the following properties : ( 1 ) it is additive , meaning @xmath1023 for any @xmath1024 ; ( 2 ) it is symmetric under exchange of @xmath138 and @xmath168 ; and ( 3 ) it is a bipartite monotone , in that it is non - increasing under locc operations that can be performed by alice and bob without a shared phase reference .",
    "the state @xmath1012 , which we identified above as an elementary unit of shared phase reference , has an siv of @xmath216 .",
    "two measures  the entanglement and the siv  completely quantify the nonlocal resources of a bipartite state . to prove this result , the general idea is to show that alice and bob can , through locc restricted by the superselection rule , reversibly convert an asymptotic number of copies of the bipartite state into a number of states with only the first type of resource ( entanglement ) and none of the second ( siv ) , and a number of states with only the second and none of the first .",
    "let alice and bob share @xmath171 copies of a bipartite state @xmath1018 , which has entanglement @xmath1025 and siv @xmath1021 .",
    "in addition , let alice and bob each have in their possession an arbitrary number of quantum registers  quantum systems that are not restricted by any superselection rule , such as were discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsubsec : quantent ] ; these registers are initiated in an arbitrary unentangled state @xmath1026 .",
    "then the transformation @xmath1027 is asymptotically reversible , and alice and bob can perform this transformation with locc restricted by the ssr , where the coefficients @xmath1028 are gaussian - distributed with variance @xmath1029 , and @xmath1030 is a maximally - entangled bell state of a pair of qubits of alice s and bob s quantum registers .",
    "let s analyze the two states on the right side of eq .  .",
    "the first state , latexmath:[$\\sum_n c_n    state serves as a good `` standard '' shared rf for large @xmath171  @xcite .",
    "also , although it is a non - separable pure state , the entanglement in the presence of a ssr , @xmath1013 , of this state is zero .",
    "in contrast , the state of the unrestricted registers @xmath1032 clearly contains an amount of entanglement equal to @xmath1033 standard ebits . as",
    "this system is a quantum register , and not a system with a phase degree of freedom , it clearly has no function as a shared phase reference ; thus , the siv of this state is zero .",
    "the two states on the right side of eq .",
    ", then , represent standard forms for each type of nonlocal resource  superselection induced variance , and entanglement in the presence of a ssr  and contain none of the other type .    a proof that the transformation   is asymptotically reversible with locc restricted by the ssr can be found in  @xcite . in their proof",
    ", they used the entropy of entanglement @xmath330 rather than @xmath1013 ; we note that in the asymptotic limit for an abelian ssr , @xmath1034 for any pure state @xmath1018  @xcite .",
    "thus , their proof applies directly to the above statement .",
    "this result can be extended to apply to mixed states  @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that explicit protocols for activation  creating states with @xmath1035 using states with @xmath1036 using a quantum shared reference frame state  have been developed  @xcite .",
    "as noted in the previous section , the state @xmath1037 can be viewed as the elementary unit of a shared phase reference between alice and bob , uncorrelated with any other .",
    "this state has the appearance of a maximally - entangled bell state ( see sec .  [",
    "subsec : entanglement ] ) , and so a natural question is to ask whether a number of imperfect ( noisy ) states can be _ purified _ to a smaller number of superior states of this form . of course , for such a process to be of any use , it would need to be implementable without the use of some other , unbounded shared rf .",
    "an affirmative answer would mean that shared rfs are a resource that can be purified , just like entanglement .",
    "unfortunately , however , such a task does not appear to be possible , as we now demonstrate , following  @xcite .",
    "consider a noisy shared rf state that is a mixture of the state @xmath1012 with probability @xmath1038 and the state @xmath1039 measurement on the target qubit .",
    "each party obtains a measurement outcome @xmath1040 , which they communicate with each other classically , and compare whether the results are the same or different .",
    "effectively , though this process , they have measured the joint non - local operator @xmath1041 in the standard entanglement purification protocol , if alice and bob keep only those states where they obtain the same measurement results , the resulting states will have higher fidelity with the state @xmath1012 .",
    "note , however , that this protocol requires operations which are not u(1)-invariant .",
    "for example , a measurement of @xmath1042 must be performed relative to that party s local phase reference .",
    "let alice and bob make use of unbounded local phase references in this protocol .",
    "note that the operator @xmath847 is defined with respect to alice s phase reference , and @xmath846 with respect to bob s . if their phase references differ by a phase shift @xmath835 , then these two operations are related by @xmath1043 ; see sec .",
    "[ subsec : commcomplexity ] .",
    "thus , the state to which they are purifying in this instance is @xmath1044 if alice s and bob s local phase references are _ uncorrelated _ , as we assumed , then @xmath835 is completely unknown , and the protocol does _ not _ yield a state with higher fidelity with @xmath1012 .",
    "we conclude this section with a discussion of a promising approach to describing the effect of using bounded rfs .",
    "as demonstrated above , bounded rfs limit one s ability to prepare states and to perform quantum operations and measurements on a system , and the nature of these limitations is similar in many ways to that of decoherence .",
    "one is led , then , to ask whether it is possible to treat bounded rfs externally rather than internally ( in the sense of sec .",
    "[ dequantphaseref ] ) by positing an unavoidable decoherence . in other words ,",
    "if such a description existed , then the bounded size of the rf could be said to effectively reduce the purity and/or coherence of systems described with respect to it .    while no completely general description of treating bounded rfs in this manner",
    "has yet been developed , specific examples of such decoherence mechanisms and their consequences have been discussed in various relational approaches to quantum theory  @xcite .",
    "these discussions have primarily focussed on the tricky issue of internalizing time in quantum theory .",
    "unsurprisingly , given the interpretation of certain types of phase references as clocks , these relational formulations generally follow along the lines of the procedures we have already reviewed .",
    "one begins by treating all systems which can serve as a clock as internal , constructs ( pure or mixed ) states that are invariant under global time shifts , identifies relational spaces in the decoherence - free subsystems , re - factorizes the hilbert space in terms of the induced tensor product , and finally interprets the new formulation as the ` true ' dynamical description .",
    "as expected , a form of decoherence in this new description is found whenever the size of the internalized reference system(s ) is bounded .",
    "it is an interesting open problem to identify the appropriate decoherence maps ( if they exist ) that describe the dynamics of a system relative to a bounded ( particularly non - abelian ) rf .",
    "while one can debate the appropriateness of these approaches from a foundational perspective , such an approach would certainly be useful for addressing questions in the field of quantum information .",
    "the study of reference frames and superselection rules in the context of quantum information theory is an unfinished task . in this section ,",
    "we provide an overview of the topics we have discussed together with some open problems and research directions , while outlining the practical and foundational significance of this sort of investigation .",
    "it is useful to divide the practical applications into two broad categories corresponding to whether their purpose is the manipulation of speakable information or of unspeakable information , that is , corresponding to the nature of their inputs and outputs .",
    "the first category contains the standard problems of interest in quantum information theory , both those that use quantum systems to manipulate classical information , and those whose inputs and outputs are themselves quantum information .",
    "even though these ultimately process speakable information ( whether classical or quantum ) , protocols for such tasks must always encode this information using _ some _ degree of freedom , which requires some form of rf . thus we are led to ask how much the absence of a particular rf or of a shared rf among separated parties decreases the efficiency of various information - processing tasks , or increases the practical difficulty of implementing them .",
    "what is the answer to such questions in the case where one has an imprecise rf or two parties share rfs that are only partially correlated ?",
    "such questions have been considered here for a variety of tasks , such as quantum and classical communication ( sec .",
    "[ subsec : nosrfcomm ] ) , quantum key distribution ( sec .",
    "[ subsec : qkd ] ) , and implementing quantum gates ( sec .  [ subsec : precision ] ) .",
    "there are many more tasks that could be considered .",
    "also , most of the communication and cryptographic problems considered to date have determined the efficiency only in the case where one demands perfect fidelity encoding and decoding and perfect security .",
    "furthermore , these sorts of questions have been scarcely addressed for the case of shared rf that are partially correlated . finally ,",
    "although there have been a few experiments demonstrating the viability of some of these schemes , such as relational encodings ( sec .",
    "[ subsec : consequencesqip ] ) , the development of realistic physical implementations remains as much a source of experimental challenges as any other quantum technology .",
    "the second category of applications consists of tasks that explicitly involve the manipulation of unspeakable information , such as clock synchronization or the alignment of cartesian frames .",
    "quantum considerations become important to achieve the optimal precision and it is the tools of quantum information theory that are best suited to a treatment of the problem .",
    "we may describe the alignment of remote reference frames as the communication of unspeakable information , and as soon as one starts describing and thinking about such tasks in the language of information theory , many new tasks suggest themselves .",
    "examples mentioned in this review are : dense coding of unspeakable information ( sec .",
    "[ subsec : densecoding ] ) , using private shared rfs as a cryptographic key ( sec .",
    "[ subsec : privatesrfs ] ) , the private communication of unspeakable information ( sec .",
    "[ subsec : privateunspeakable ] ) , and secret sharing of unspeakable information .",
    "many more analogies of this sort could be considered . indeed , for almost any information - theoretic task of interest today , it is interesting to muse about possible analogues of it for unspeakable information .",
    "( a particularly intriguing question to consider is whether there is such an analogue for computation . ) on the experimental side , the implementation of quantum protocols for even the best - studied of these sorts of tasks , the alignment of reference frames , has , with the exception of phase estimation , only just begun to be investigated .    as emphasized in the introduction , imposing a restriction on operations generically leads to the identification of a novel resource to overcome this restriction , and we are then compelled to develop a theory for how that resource may be manipulated .",
    "for instance , under the restriction of locc , entanglement becomes a resource , and the theory of how this resource can be manipulated  the theory of entanglement  has been the subject of a significant amount of work in recent years .",
    "others have considered the theory of communication under natural restrictions such as local operations and _ public _ communication  @xcite or restrictions to only gaussian quantum - optical states and operations  @xcite .",
    "a superselection rule ( either local and global ) is another sort of natural restriction , and under this restriction , any quantum state that acts as an rf becomes a resource .",
    "the theory of such resources might aptly be called the _ theory of quantum reference frames _ or the _ theory of unspeakable quantum information_. it endeavors to answer questions such as how this resource is depleted with use , transformed from one form to another , shared among several parties , etcetera . such a theory has only begun to be developed . the limited results on bounded quantum reference frames , described in sec .  [",
    "sec : boundedrfs ] ( see also sec .  [",
    "subsec : entanglement ] ) are evidence of this .",
    "moreover , in a sense there is a family of theories to be developed , because we obtain different results depending on the group @xmath12 with which the superselection rule is associated .",
    "many investigations to date have applied only to the cases of the group u(1 ) and/or the group su(2 ) .",
    "ultimately , one would like to have a generic theory of unspeakable information that applies to any group ; in particular , non - compact groups ( such as the lorentz or poincar groups ) may require more general mathematical tools than those discussed here .",
    "it is worth noting that this research is not necessarily driven by applications . in this sense",
    ", it is similar to the study of entanglement in quantum information theory , which although initially motivated by its practical applications , has increasingly become an interesting subject in its own right .",
    "of course , just as the development of the theory of entanglement has led to many unforeseen practical dividends , we may expect this of a general theory of unspeakable information as well .    finally ,",
    "applying the tools of quantum information theory to the study of rfs and ssrs can shed light on foundational issues in quantum theory .",
    "examples from this review include whether there exist axiomatic superselection rules and the controversy over the nonlocality of a single photon .",
    "another issue which is likely to be clarified by an analysis in terms of quantum reference frames is that of spontaneous symmetry breaking , which is significant both in condensed matter physics and quantum field theory and the foundational status of which is notoriously murky .",
    "foundational issues related to particle statistics may also benefit from such an analysis .",
    "for instance , an interesting open question is whether the univalence superselection rule , which forbids coherent superpositions of bosons and fermions  @xcite , may be lifted by an appropriate reference frame  @xcite .",
    "because this ssr is not associated with a compact group , answering this question requires a formalism more general than the one presented here .",
