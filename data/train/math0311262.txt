    "boolean cell complexes were introduced by bjrner in [ bj ] and by garsia and stanton in [ gs ] .",
    "stanley studied their face posets , namely simplicial posets , in [ st3 ] .",

    "our interest is in lexicographic shelling for balanced , boolean cell complexes .",
    "a regular cell complex is * boolean * if every interval in its face poset is a boolean algebra .",
    "a boolean cell complex is much like a simplicial complex , except that more than one face may have the same set of vertices .",
    "we note that boolean cell complexes may alternatively be defined quite naturally in terms of simplicial sets .",
    "we find it convenient to refer to @xmath27-cells as @xmath27-faces , 0-cells as vertices , and in the same vein to call cells of top dimension facets .",
    "a boolean cell complex is * pure * of dimension @xmath57 if all the maximal cells have dimension @xmath57 , and then it is * balanced * if the vertices may be colored with @xmath58 colors so that no two vertices in a face have the same color .",
    "we refer to the set of colors for the vertices in a face as the * support * of the face and say a face has * disconnected * support if the support includes @xmath59 for @xmath60 and does not include some @xmath61 for @xmath62 .",
    "bjrner established the following notion of shellability ( phrased slightly differently ) for boolean cell complexes in [ bj1 ] .",
    "a boolean cell complex is * shellable * if the facets may be ordered @xmath63 so that @xmath64 is pure of codimension one for each @xmath65 .",
    "recall that the order complex of a finite , ranked poset is a balanced simplicial complex in which vertices are colored by poset rank . this will allow us to translate poset notions of lexicographic shellability to conditions on the order complex which",

    "one may conclude from the existence of a shelling that a boolean complex has the homotopy type of a wedge of spheres of top dimension and is cohen - macaulay ( cf .",

    "this may be shown by shelling its barycentric subdivision ( cf .",
    "[ bj2 , p. 173 ] ) , which is a simplicial complex , then invoking munkres classical result [ mu2 , p.117,121 - 123 ] that cohen - macaulayness does not depend on choice of triangulation .",
    "an integer labelling of the covering relations in a finite poset with @xmath23 and @xmath66 is an * el - labelling * if it has the following two properties , which together constitute the * increasing chain condition*.    1 .",
    "every interval has a unique saturated chain with ( weakly ) increasing edge labels .",
    "the increasing chain is the lexicographically smallest chain of labels on an interval .",
    "a * chain - labelling * is a labelling of poset covering relations such that the label assigned to a covering relation @xmath67 may depend on the choice of root , namely on the saturated chain @xmath68 as well as on @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "recall from [ bw1 ] , [ bw2 ] that a * cl - labelling * is any chain - labelling satisfying the increasing - chain condition .",
    "an edge - labelling or chain - labelling induces a partial order on facets by lexicographically ordering the sequences of labels assigned to saturated chains .",
    "it is shown in [ bj1 ] ( resp .",
    "[ bw2 ] ) that any total order extension of the lexicographic order given by an el - labelling ( resp .",
    "cl - labelling ) is a shelling order on facets .",
    "kozlov generalized poset el - shellability ( resp .",
    "cl - shellability ) in [ ko2 ] to a criterion he called * ec - shellability * ( resp .",
    "* cc - shellability * ) by relaxing the requirement that every poset interval must have a unique increasing chain . in effect",
    ", he instead requires each interval to have a unique saturated chain that behaves topologically like an increasing chain with respect to the chosen lexicographic order .",
    "we rediscovered ec / cc - shellability in the course of joint work with kleinberg ( see [ hk ] ) ; it will be convenient for the fairly involved shelling arguments in later sections to use the notation and point of view taken in [ hk ] , so now let us review terminology from [ hk ] .    we classify ascents and descents in a poset chain - labelling ( or edge - labelling ) @xmath71 as follows : let us say that a pair of edges @xmath67 and @xmath72 constitute a * topological ascent * if the word consisting of two consecutive labels @xmath73 and @xmath74 is lexicographically smallest on the interval from @xmath69 to @xmath75 and let us say that the pair of covering relations @xmath67 and @xmath76 comprise a * topological descent * otherwise .",
    "we may further distinguish between topological ascents with increasing or decreasing consecutive labels by calling the former * honest ascents * and the latter * swap descents*. similarly , we call topological descents with decreasing labels * honest descents * and all others * swap ascents*. in this language , a poset is ec - shellable ( resp .",
    "cc - shellable ) if each interval ( resp .",
    "rooted interval ) has a unique topologically increasing chain ( namely a chain consisting entirely of topological ascents ) and this is the lexicographically smallest chain on the interval .",
    "it is shown in [ ko2 ] that these labellings induce lexicographic shellings , for the same reason that el - labellings and cl - labellings do .",
    "in this section , we extend cc - shellability to pure , balanced boolean cell complexes and el / cl / ec / cc - shellability to pure , balanced simplicial complexes .",
    "we always choose indices so that @xmath77 precedes @xmath78 lexicographically for @xmath79 .",
    "when the vertices @xmath80 in a face @xmath81 are colored @xmath82 , then we call the set @xmath83 the * support * of @xmath81 . it will be convenient to represent an arbitrary color set as @xmath84 for some @xmath85 , @xmath86 and with @xmath87 for all @xmath88 .",
    "we use @xmath89 to denote the collection of all possible colors from @xmath90 to @xmath91 .",
    "thus , the colors not in @xmath55 are those between @xmath92 and @xmath90 for some @xmath27 , and the colors that are smaller than @xmath93 or larger than @xmath94 .",
    "let us begin by translating the poset lexicographic shellability condition of bjrner and wachs [ bw1 ] to a condition on the order complex so as to make an analogous condition for pure , balanced boolean cell complexes .",
    "consider any finite , graded poset with unique minimal and maximal elements @xmath23 and @xmath66 .",
    "notice that the increasing chain condition on the hasse diagram of a poset may be viewed as a condition on the order complex .",
    "we make the following conventions :    1 .   the label assigned to a poset covering relation from rank @xmath27 to @xmath95",
    "is placed on the consequent order complex edge colored @xmath96 for @xmath97 .",
    "the label of each poset edge involving @xmath23 ( resp .",
    "@xmath66 ) is assigned to the corresponding vertex colored 1 ( resp .",
    "@xmath98 ) .",
    "the interval from @xmath69 to @xmath70 in the poset is the collection of faces colored @xmath99 which include the vertices @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "4 .   let @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "then each poset saturated chain from @xmath69 to @xmath70 translates to a walk on the resulting face colored @xmath102 in the order complex .",
    "such a walk along edges colored @xmath103 for @xmath104 passes through the vertex colors sequentially .",
    "the increasing - chain condition on an interval from rank @xmath27 to @xmath61 amounts to a condition on all the faces in the order complex consisting of vertices colored @xmath105 which include a particular pair of vertices colored @xmath27 and @xmath61 .",
    "this requirement makes sense for arbitrary pure , balanced simplicial complexes , using the balancing to play the role of poset rank . any pure , balanced simplicial complex will be lexicographically shellable if it satisfies this increasing chain condition along with another requirement which we call the crossing condition . for balanced boolean cell complexes ,",
    "we must define the notion of interval a little bit more carefully , but again the increasing chain condition will be a similar requirement on cells in an interval ; the increasing chain condition together with the crossing condition and a third requirement called the multiple - face - overlap condition will imply that a pure , balanced boolean cell complex is lexicographically shellable .",
    "let us generalize the notions of interval and rooted interval to balanced complexes , as follows .",
    "let @xmath106 be a face colored @xmath107 for some @xmath79 in a pure , balanced boolean cell complex .",
    "the * rooted interval * specified by @xmath106 is the collection of faces colored @xmath108 that contain @xmath106 .",
    "notice that a cell complex which is not a simplicial complex might have several faces comprised of the same vertex set of support @xmath107 .",
    "each of these faces gives rise to a different interval .",
    "for this reason , it does not seem wise to allow edge - labellings and un - rooted intervals when workin with boolean cell complexes that are not simplicial complexes .",
    "let @xmath109 be a pair of vertices colored @xmath110 for @xmath79 in a pure , balanced simplicial complex",
    ". then ( unrooted ) * interval * specified by @xmath69 and @xmath70 is the collection of faces colored @xmath105 which contain the vertices @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "next , we adapt the definition of topological ascent and descent to balanced boolean cell complexes",
    ".    a facet @xmath78 has a * topological descent * at the color @xmath111 if there is a codimension one face in @xmath112 omitting only the vertex colored @xmath111 .",
    "otherwise , it has a * topological ascent * at rank @xmath111 .    in a poset",
    ", one may view the saturated chains as non - self - intersecting paths from @xmath23 to @xmath24 in the hasse diagram , so then saturated chains intersect where two of these paths cross each other .",
    "notice that when two poset saturated chains cross @xmath113 times in the proper part of the poset , one obtains @xmath114 distinct saturated chains by choosing which of the two saturated chains to follow on each of the @xmath115 segments between consecutive crossing points .",
    "the existence of these poset chains implies for lexicographic orders that every maximal face in @xmath116 skips a single interval of consecutive ranks .",
    "the crossing condition is designed to test for this behavior in arbitrary balanced complexes .",
    "notice in the case of boolean cell complexes that are not simplicial complexes that the crossing condition , given next , does not always ensure that maximal faces in @xmath117 have support skipping a single interval of consecutive colors .",
    "specifically , it does not apply to faces @xmath118 of support @xmath119 such that another face in @xmath120 has support @xmath121 .",
    "the multiple - face - overlap condition accounts for these faces .",
    "[ cc - shell ] a balanced boolean cell complex is * cc - shellable * if there is a chain - labelling satisfying the following three conditions .    1 .   * increasing chain condition . *",
    "each rooted edge - interval has a unique extension with topologically increasing labels and this is the lexicographically smallest face in the interval ( i.e. its lexicographically earliest extension to a facet is lexicographically smallest among facets that may be obtained from faces in the interval ) .",

    "we claim that every descent is an honest descent . replacing a descent @xmath225 by the ascent @xmath226",
    "yields a lexicographically smaller permutation , thus a member of a different orbit ( since the orbit representative was already the lexicographically smallest member of its orbit ) .",
    "in fact , the permutation obtained by this swap is the orbit representative of a new orbit since no new ascents have been introduced by swapping @xmath227 and @xmath228 , which means that the requirement that @xmath229 come before @xmath230 and @xmath231 for all @xmath61 is still satisfied .    whenever an orbit representative @xmath78 has @xmath195 immediately preceding @xmath197 and then later has @xmath232 before @xmath196 , there is a swap ascent at the node between @xmath195 and @xmath197 .",
    "this is because the facet @xmath77 with @xmath232 and @xmath196 swapped is lexicographically earlier , and the facets @xmath233 share a codimension one face which omits the node between @xmath195 and @xmath197 .",
    "notice that the characterization of this node as a swap ascent depends on later ranks in the chain .",
    "this is not a problem , since the labels themselves , and thus the lexicographic order on facets , only depends on the root of the chain .",
    "it is not hard to check that all other ascents are honest ascents , and we have already shown that there are no swap descents .",
    "now we must verify that each rooted interval has a unique ( topologically ) increasing chain .",
    "if two orbit representatives both had only topological ascents on a rooted interval from @xmath69 to @xmath70 , each would have labels in increasing order and be free of swap ascents of the type described above . to avoid descents ,",
    "each increasing chain must begin by completing all the requisite half - filled rows of @xmath69 in increasing order , and then begin new rows , proceeding sequentially .",
    "the lexicographically smallest chain in the rooted edge - interval proceeds through all the empty rows of @xmath69 to be filled in @xmath70 before turning to empty rows of @xmath69 to be half - filled in @xmath70 . any lexicographically later orbit on the interval which is free of descents would also first complete the set of half - full rows of @xmath69 to be filled in @xmath70 and",
    "then would proceed to new rows . to differ from the lexicographically smallest orbit it would at some point necessarily insert one element into a new row immediately before inserting two elements to the next new row .",
    "this would yield a swap ascent , as discussed above .",
    "for example , the orbit labelled @xmath234 comes after the increasing chain labelled @xmath235 in the interval @xmath236 in @xmath237 , but @xmath234 has a swap ascent at @xmath238 since @xmath239 comes before @xmath240 in any orbit including @xmath234 .",

    "we may assume that @xmath106 has support @xmath242 , because we will show ( in the last paragraph of our proof ) that for @xmath42 every maximal face in @xmath243 has support omitting a single interval .",

    "notice that @xmath67 is equivalent to @xmath249 in @xmath106 , but not in @xmath81 .",
    "this is only possible if two rows are equivalent in @xmath106 but not in @xmath81 , i.e.  if two different rows switch from empty to half - full on the interval skipped by @xmath106 .",

    "in particular , this embedding will give us an ordering on the blocks for each partition in the chain , which depends only on the root of that chain .",

    "we will order the blocks in the fashion described at the beginning of section  [ nearicc ] , so this will determine our choice of representation . see figure  [ twoblock ] for an example .",
    "let us assign labels to orbits @xmath320 of rooted covering relations .",
    "the distinct @xmath315 with a fixed root @xmath321 are specified by which type of block from @xmath69 is split ( recalling that type means equivalence class ) together with the content of its children .",

    "however , kozlov s proof is topological and ours is combinatorial . more specifically , kozlov uses the interpretation of @xmath480 as the reduced euler characteristic for @xmath490 , deducing that it is 0 from the fact that @xmath491 is collapsible .",
    "we instead use the fact that @xmath480 counts boolean intervals with minimal element of support @xmath55 in a partitioning for @xmath139 .    to show @xmath486 for a particular @xmath55",
    ", we will show that @xmath55 never occurs as a descent set in a shelling step or as the support of the minimal new face assigned to some non - shelling step .",
    "we work in terms of the dual poset to the partition lattice as considered in [ ha ] and [ st2 ] . to account for this",
    ", we must replace each @xmath492 by @xmath493 .",
    "thus , the next theorem requires that we show there are no shelling steps that begin with entirely ( topological ) ascents and then consist entirely of ( topological ) descents as soon as the first ( topological ) descent occurs ; we must also check a similar condition for the non - shelling steps .",
    "the multiplicity @xmath7 of the trivial representation in @xmath8 is 0 for @xmath494 and @xmath495 .",
    "first consider the facets that are inserted as shelling steps .",
    "recall our convention of placing bars as far to the left as possible at each step .",
    "a facet with descent set @xmath496 could only come from initially inserting bars left to right creating blocks nondecreasing in size ; after this , we would need to completely refine the rightmost block using only topological descents and then proceed similarly through the remaining blocks from right to left .",
    "if the initial insertion of bars left to right created any blocks of size greater than 2 , it would be impossible to later refine such a block with only topological descents .",
    "thus , we may assume bars are initially placed left to right creating blocks entirely of size 1 followed by blocks entirely of size 2 , as in figure [ hanlon ] .",
    "( 100,55)(20,5 )    however , notice that the two rightmost blocks of size 2 will be equivalent to each other , which means the left one must be split first .",
    "this necessitates the existence of a ( topological ) ascent at some point after the first ( topological ) descent , as in figure [ hanlon ] , so we are done with the shelling steps .",
    "the non - shelling steps all have support including ranks other than only the final string by virtue of creating equivalent blocks to be partitioned from left to right .",
    "a descent is necessitated by the insertion of a bar creating the rightmost of the equivalent blocks farther to the right than bars to be inserted within the equivalent blocks ; there will be an ascent at some point after this descent since the partitionings of link subcomplexes can not have facets with minimal faces of full support .",
    "let us review notation from [ gs ] needed to state a theorem of garsia and stanton ( which appears as theorem 6.2 in [ gs ] and is restated as theorem [ gs ] below ) .",
    "let @xmath310 be a balanced boolean cell complex consisting of vertices @xmath497 , ordered in a way that is compatible with their colors ; that is , we choose a vertex order such that @xmath498 is colored with a smaller number than @xmath499 for all @xmath500 .",
    "if @xmath115 is a face of @xmath310 consisting of vertices @xmath501 , then denote by @xmath502 the monomial @xmath503 .",
    "when a group @xmath142 acts on @xmath310 , let @xmath504 let @xmath505 , a sum over vertices in @xmath310 of color @xmath27 .",
    "a set of chain monomials @xmath506 given by a collection @xmath313 of chains in a poset @xmath22 is called a basic set if every element @xmath507 of the stanley - reisner ring @xmath508 has a unique expression @xmath509 where the coefficients @xmath510 are polynomials with rational coefficients in the variables @xmath511 .",
    "all cohen - macaulay posets have such basic sets , and [ gs ] shows how a quotient complex shelling gives an explicit basic set .",
    "[ gs ] if @xmath512 has a shelling @xmath513 where @xmath514 is the minimal new face in @xmath77 and @xmath515 is a representative within @xmath310 of the orbit of @xmath516 , then the orbit polynomials @xmath517 form a basic set for @xmath518 .",
    "thus , our lexicographic shelling for @xmath48 yields a ring invariant basic set",
    ". a simple description of which descent sets occur in the lexicographic shelling would be desirable since it would yield a nice description of these ring invariant basic sets , according to theorem [ gs ] .",
    "it would also be interesting to determine whether the incidence matrix given by our partitioning for @xmath10 is nonsingular , since that would imply a basic set for @xmath429^{s_n}$ ] , by another result of [ gs ] .",
    "stanley showed in [ st1 ] that the face ring of a cohen - macaulay simplicial poset is a cohen - macaulay ring . according to proposition [ goofcm ]",
    ", our shelling for @xmath43 implies that the face ring @xmath519 $ ] is cohen - macaulay ( over the integers ) . however , reiner constructed an isomorphism in [ re ] between the face ring @xmath520 $ ] and the ring of invariants @xmath521^g$ ] .",
    "reiner s result allows us to conclude that the invariant subring @xmath522^{s_2\\wr s_n}$ ] is cohen - macaulay over the integers .",
    "furthermore , reiner showed that in the case of quotients of the boolean algebra by a permutation subgroup @xmath30 of @xmath50 , the invariant subring of the polynomial ring @xmath523 $ ] under the action of @xmath30 is cohen - macaulay over @xmath524 whenever the same is true for the invariant subring @xmath525^g$ ] of the boolean algebra s face ring over @xmath524 ; reiner recently provided a proof for this ( formerly unpublished ) result as an appendix to [ he ] .",
    "since @xmath3 is such a permutation subgroup of @xmath194 , we may conclude the following from our shelling for @xmath526 .",
    "the subring of invariant polynomials @xmath14^{s_2\\wr s_n } $ ] is cohen - macaulay for any field @xmath15 .    when @xmath15 is the field of complex numbers , this is a special case of a result from [ he ] , but the shelling gives the cohen - macaulay property also for fields of finite characteristic , or equivalently for integer coefficients",
    "the author thanks vic reiner for suggesting @xmath360 and @xmath48 as candidates for the lexicographic shelling criterion for balanced complexes as well as for explaining to her the potential implications discussed in sections 6 and 8 and also suggesting the use of molien s theorem in conjunction with section 3 .",
