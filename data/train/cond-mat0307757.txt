    "tremendous interest in magneto - transport in two - dimensional electron system ( 2des ) has recently revived since the experimental discovery of giant oscillations of the longitudinal resistance as a function of the magnetic field in high mobility two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas ( eg ) subjected to a microwave radiation,@xcite particularly following the recent observations of `` zero - resistance '' states in very clean samples by two independent groups.@xcite these radiation - induced oscillations of the longitudinal magnetoresistivity @xmath0 are periodical in inverse magnetic field @xmath1 but , unlike the well - known shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) oscillation whose period is controlled by the electron density @xmath2,@xcite their periods are determined by the radiation frequency @xmath3 . the observed @xmath0 oscillations exhibit a smooth magnetic - field variation with the resistivity maxima at @xmath4 and minima at @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the cyclotron frequency , @xmath7 ) having positive @xmath8 ranging around @xmath9.@xcite the resistivity minimum goes downward with increasing sample mobility and/or increasing radiation intensity until a vanishing resistance state shows up , while the hall resistivity keeps the classical form @xmath10 with no sign of quantum hall plateau over the whole magnetic field range exhibiting @xmath0 oscillation . later independent experiments@xcite confirmed these results and the corresponding zero - conductance states were also observed in the corbino samples.@xcite    to explore the origin of these peculiar `` zero - resistance '' states , different mechanisms have been suggested.@xcite as is shown by andreev _ et al._@xcite that a negative linear conductance implies that the zero current state is intrinsically unstable : the system spontaneously develops a non - vanishing local current density which is determined by the condition that the component of electric field parallel to the local current vanishes .",
    "thus the appearance of negative longitudinal resistivity or conductivity in a uniform model suffices to explain the observed vanishing resistance .",
    "the possibility of absolute negative photoconductance in a 2des subject to a perpendicular magnetic field was first explored 30 years ago by ryzhii.@xcite experimentally keay _",
    "et al_@xcitereported the observation of absolute negative conductance in sequential resonant tunneling superlattices driven by intense terahertz radiation .",
    "recent works@xcite indicated that the periodical structure of the density of states ( dos ) of the 2deg in a magnetic field and the photon - excited electron scatterings by impurities are the main origin of the magnetoresistance oscillations .",
    "durst _ et .",
    "al._@xcite proposed a microscopic analysis for the conductivity assuming a @xmath11-correlated disorder and a simple form of the 2d electron self - energy oscillatory with the magnetic field , obtaining the correct period , phase and the possible negative resistivity .",
    "shi and xie@xcite gave a similar result using the tien and gorden current formula@xcite for photon - assisted coherent tunneling .",
    "a more quantitative theoretical description was reported recently using a balance equation approach developed for radiation - induced magnetotransport in faraday geometry,@xcite not only reproducing the correct period , phase and the negative resistivity of the main oscillations , but also predicting the secondary peaks and additional maxima and minima observed in the experiment,@xcite and identifying them as arising from double- and triple - photon processes .",
    "a quantum boltzmann equation approach based on self - consistent born approximation for large filling factors has also been presented very recently , taking account of the elastic ( impurity ) scattering as the major mechanism for radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillation.@xcite in addition to photon - assisted impurity scattering referred above as the mechanism of the absolute negative conductivity ( anc ) , other possible mechanisms were also explored in the literature .",
    "proposed that acoustic phonon scattering@xcite and heating of electrons@xcite could also serve as the mechanisms of anc in 2des , and made a further attempt to connect them with experiments.@xcite    one of the most important and interesting features of this phenomenon is its sensitive temperature dependence .",
    "the `` zero - resistance '' states and radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations show up strongly only at low temperatures typically around @xmath12k or lower . at fixed microwave power with increasing temperature , not only the zero - resistance regions become narrower and eventually disappear , the whole oscillatory structure ( peaks and valleys ) diminish as well . at temperature @xmath134 - 5k",
    ", oscillatory structure disappears completely and the resistivivty @xmath0-versus - magnetic field becomes essentially structureless.@xcite the temperature - variation of @xmath0 at deepest minima exhibits approximate activated - type behavior @xmath14 .",
    "however , the activation energies observed by both groups are very high : up to 10k and 20k at @xmath15 minimum respectively.@xcite these values are about an order of magnitude higher than the microwave photon energy ( @xmath163 - 5k ) and landau - level spacing ( @xmath172k ) . furthermore , different @xmath18 values observed by the two groups indicate that the disappearing speed of the oscillatory structure with increasing temperature is sample dependent.@xcite to my knowledge , there has been no theoretical attempt to explain this temperature dependence , except that a conjecture of the formation of an energy gap around the fermi surface is suggested under microwave irradiation around the resistance minima.@xcite    the recently constructed balance - equation model,@xcite which provides a quantitative and tractable approach to radiation - induced magnetotransport in faraday geometry , enables us not only to analyze the magnetoresistance oscillation , its dependence on the radiation intensity , but also to deal with its temperature variation in a comprehensive way .",
    "we suggest that the temperature suppression of the magnetoresistance oscillation in these high - mobility 2des comes mainly from the growth of the landau level broadening due to the rapid enhancement of acoustic phonon scatterings with increasing temperature at this low temperature range",
    ".    in this paper we will carry out a detailed theoretical investigation on the different aspects of radiation - induced magnetoresitance oscillation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "for the convenience and completeness we present the general theoretical model and formulation in section ii . as a typical example",
    "we analyze gaas - based systems for which the relevant material parameters are discussed in the section iii .",
    "section iv concentrates on the transport properties of gaas - based heterosystems at lattice temperature @xmath12k .",
    "we will give a detailed discussion on the impurity and acoustic phonon scattering related linear and nonlinear magnetoresistance induced by the irradiation of 0.1thz microwave of different intensities , and the effect of elevated electron temperature .",
    "section v is devoted to the analyses on the lattice - temperature dependence of the magnetoresistance oscillation .",
    "finally , a brief summary is given in section vi .",
    "the experiments allow us to assume the 2deg being in extended states over the magnetic field range relevant to this phenomenon . for a general treatment , we consider @xmath2 electrons in a unit area of a quasi-2d system in the @xmath19-@xmath20 plane with a confining potential @xmath21 in the @xmath22-direction .",
    "these electrons , besides interacting with each other , are scattered by random impurities / disorders and by phonons in the lattice . to include possible elliptically polarized microwave illumination",

    "it should be noted that the uniform electric field ( dc and ac ) appears only in @xmath33 , and that @xmath34 is just the hamiltonian of a quasi-2d system subjected to a magnetic field .",
    "the coupling between the center - of - mass and the relative electrons exists via the electron - impurity and electron - phonon interactions .",

    ", the center - of - mass coordinate @xmath46 and velocity @xmath47 can be treated classically , i.e. as the time - dependent expectation values of the center - of - mass coordinate and velocity , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , such that @xmath50 .",
    "we are concerned with the steady transport state under an irradiation of single frequency and focus on the photon - induced dc resistivity and the energy absorption of the hf field .",
    "these quantities are directly related to the time - averaged and/or base - frequency oscillating components of the center - of - mass velocity .",
    "although higher harmonics of the current may affect the dc and lower harmonic terms of the drift velocity through entering the damping force and energy exchange rates in the resulting equations , in an ordinary semiconductor the power of even the third harmonic current is rather weak as compared to the fundamental . for the hf field intensity in the experiments , the effect of higher harmonic current is safely negligible .",
    "hence , it suffices to assume that the center - of - mass velocity , i.e. the electron drift velocity , consists of a dc part @xmath51 and a stationary time - dependent part @xmath52 of the form @xmath53 with this , the exponential factor in the operator equations can be expanded in terms of bessel functions @xmath54 : @xmath55 here the argument in the bessel functions @xmath56^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ] and @xmath57 . on the other hand , for 2d systems having electron sheet density of order of 10@xmath58 m@xmath59 ,",

    "we finally obtain the force and energy balance equations : @xmath65 @xmath66 here @xmath67 is the time - averaged damping force , @xmath68 is the time - averaged rate of the electron energy - gain from the hf field , @xmath69 , which can be written in a form obtained from the right hand side of eq.([eqf0 ] ) by replacing the @xmath70 factor with @xmath71 , and @xmath72 is the time - averaged rate of the electron energy - loss due to coupling with phonons , whose expression can be obtained from the second term on the right hand side of eq.([eqf0 ] ) by replacing the @xmath70 factor with @xmath73 , the energy of a wavevector-@xmath74 phonon .",

    "compared with that without the hf field ( @xmath91 term only),@xcite we see that in an electron gas having impurity and/or phonon scattering ( otherwise homogeneous ) , a hf field of frequency @xmath3 opens additional channels for electron transition : an electron in a state can absorb or emit one or several photons and scattered to a differnt state with the help of impurities and/or phonons .",
    "the sum over @xmath92 represents contributions of single and multiple photon processes of frequency-@xmath3 photons .",
    "these photon - assisted scatterings help to transfer energy from the hf field to the electron system ( @xmath68 ) and give rise to additional damping force on the moving electrons .",

    "always appear at @xmath167 and the maxima at @xmath168 , while in the case of longitudinal acoustic scattering the maxima appear at @xmath168 and the minima at @xmath167 except the case of @xmath15 .",

    "these results are in qualitative agreement with a recent report.@xcite     ( a ) and @xmath157 ( b ) induced by transverse and longitudinal acoustic phonons under different dc bias @xmath210 in a gaas - based 2des exposed to microwave fields @xmath192 of frequency @xmath211thz having amplitude @xmath212v / cm and @xmath213v / cm respectively . here",

    "the other parameters are the same as indicated in fig.4.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    however , at temperature @xmath12k the acoustic phonon scattering contributes a part of @xmath0 which is more than an order of magnitude smaller than that contributed from impurity scattering in the system having a mobility of @xmath215@xmath196v@xmath138s@xmath138 at @xmath12k . therefore , acoustic phonon scattering essentially gives no direct contribution to the experimentally observed resistance oscillation at this low temperature .",
    "nevertheless , acoustic phonons play a key role in suppressing the resistance oscillation at elevated lattice temperatures .",
    "we will discuss this issue in section v.

    "the other parameters are the same as indicated in fig.4.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    upon the microwave irradiation the electron temperature can be higher than the lattice temperature .",
    "to have an idea of how the elevated electron temperature affects the magnetoresistivity oscillation we show in fig.6a the background impurity induced longitudinal resisitivity @xmath155 of the 2deg having several different electron temperatures @xmath216 and 50k but all at the same lattice temperature @xmath12k subject to a microwave irradiation of frequency @xmath161thz and amplitude @xmath175kv / cm .",
    "we see that at @xmath217k ( even much lower ) sdh oscillations disappear completely , but the radiation - induced oscillations remain essentially the same .",
    "only when the electron temperature becomes much higher , e.g. 50k , can appear the appreciable change in the resistance oscillation curve .",
    "this indicates that the radiation - induced resistivity oscillation is quite insensitive to electron temperature and we can analyze the moderate - strength microwave induced resistivity oscillation by neglecting the electron temperature change in the system . on the other hand , using a slightly elevated electron temperature provides a way to separate the radiation - induced oscillation from the sdh effect .",
    "fig.6b shows the effect of elevated electron temperature on transverse acoustic phonon induced resistivity @xmath156 .",
    "with electron temperature increasing from @xmath218k to 5k , the magnitude of the oscillation somewhat grows .",
    "but its absolute contribution to magnetoresistivity is still an order of magnitude smaller than the of impurity as long as the lattice temperature remains @xmath12k .",
    "experiments showed that the strongest sdh oscillations always show up on the dark resistivity curve and with enhancing the radiation intensity the sdh oscillations weaken.@xcite this fact can be easily understood as due to the rise of the electron temperature caused by the microwave illumination : sdh oscillations are suppressed by the rising electron temperature , while the radiation - induced @xmath0 oscillations remain the same as long as the lattice temperature keeps unchange .",
    "one of the most important aspect of the experimental finding on the magnetoresistance oscillation in irradiated 2des is the temperature - dependence of @xmath0 .",
    "experiments@xcite found that the `` zero - resistance '' states and radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations show up strongly only at low temperatures typically around @xmath12k or lower . at fixed microwave power with increasing temperature , not only the zero - resistance regions become narrower and eventually disappear , the whole oscillatory structure ( peaks and valleys ) diminish as well . at temperature @xmath134 - 5k",
    ", oscillatory structure disappears completely and the resistivivty @xmath0-versus magnetic field becomes essentially flat.@xcite    both groups analyzed the temperature - variation of @xmath0 at deepest minima using an activated - type dependence @xmath14 .",
    "the activation energies observed by both groups are very high and different : up to 10k and 20k at @xmath15 minimum respectively.@xcite these values are about an order of magnitude higher than the microwave photon energy ( @xmath163 - 5k ) and landau - level spacing ( @xmath172k ) .",
    "the different @xmath18 values observed by the two groups indicate that the speed of the oscillatory structure disappearing with temperature is sample dependent.@xcite to explain the temperature dependence the formation of an energy gap around the fermi surface in the spectrum is suggested under microwave irradiation around the resistance minima.@xcite    our explanation of the temperature dependence of the magnetoresistance oscillations is based on the temperature variation of the landau level broadening @xmath219 as determined by eq.([gamma ] ) . in a gaas - based system ,",
    "when the lattice temperature increases from around @xmath12k , the numbers of transverse and longitudinal acoustic phonons and thus the electron - phonon scattering strengths increase rapidly . in fig.7b",
    "we plot the zero - magnetic - field linear mobility @xmath220 due to transverse acoustic phonon scattering , @xmath221 due to longitudinal phonon scattering , and the total mobility @xmath222 as functions of lattice temperature @xmath96 for the gaas - based heterosystem with @xmath223@xmath196v@xmath138s@xmath138 at @xmath12k .",
    "we see that when temperature @xmath96 rises from 1k to 3k the phonon related mobilities decline about an order of magnitude , leading to the total mobility @xmath132 decreasing about a factor of 2.2 and , according to ( [ gamma ] ) , @xmath219 increasing about a factor of 1.5 ( assuming @xmath224 unchanged ) . the temperature growth of the landau - level width due to this enhanced phonon scattering results in the strong temperature variation of the radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillation .",
