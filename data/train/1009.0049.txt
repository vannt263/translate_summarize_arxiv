    "supernovae ( sn ) occupy an important place in astrophysics as they are a primary source of heavy elements in the universe , and generate the creation of neutron stars and cosmic rays . currently , there are some 275 galactic supernovae remnants ( snrs ) recognized @xcite with additional ones identified or discovered every few years ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    before the advent of radio astronomy",
    ", only two remnants were known via optical studies ; the crab nebula associated with sn 1054 and the remnant of kepler s sn of 1604 @xcite . today , the vast majority of known galactic snrs were first identified through their nonthermal radio emissions @xcite . with increasingly sensitive observations across a broader spectrum of wavelengths , particularly in x - rays via satellites",
    ", several recently identified snrs were discovered through non - radio observations .",
    "the first x - ray discovered galactic snr is the radio faint but x - ray bright snr g156.2 + 5.7 which was found through rosat all - sky survey images @xcite and only later confirmed in the radio @xcite . at present , there are more than a dozen snrs which were discovered through their x - ray emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) , with dozens more suspected candidate x - ray snrs @xcite .",
    "although there are many examples where optical observations have helped identify the snr nature of suspected radio detected galactic snr candidates ( e.g. , @xcite ) , recent instances where a galactic snr is first identified solely through its optical emission are exceedingly rare , with only one case known to the authors . that remnant , g65.3 + 5.7 , was found during a wide - field optical emission - line survey of the milky way @xcite .",
    "it had been missed in previous galactic radio snr surveys due to a weak and partial shell structure @xcite , weak and fragmented associated h@xmath0 emission @xcite , and was only recognized as a snr through deep [ ] @xmath55007 optical images .",
    "while hundreds of extragalactic snrs have been first identified through optical imaging ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the rarity of optically discovered galactic snrs is not surprising .",
    "apart from the great sensitivity of galactic snr radio and x - ray surveys , only 21% of the 275 known galactic snrs have any associated optical emission @xcite . moreover , while early optical investigations of snrs @xcite found relatively bright remnant emissions , recent searches of known remnants typically find only faint or fragmentary optical features detectable only through deep imaging ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    despite such long odds , here",
    "we report the discovery of an apparent new galactic snr based on its optical emission properties .",
    "it appears as a large , faint shell of emission centered at @xmath2 in the deep but low resolution h@xmath0 emission virginia tech spectral line survey ( vtss ) of the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "we also show rosat all sky survey images which may indicate the presence of very weak , diffuse x - ray emission from the remnant s interior .",
    "below we present higher resolution h@xmath0 images of this shell ( hereafter referred to simply as g159 ) and low dispersion optical spectra and propose this object is a previously unrecognized galactic snr .",
    "narrow passband ( fwhm = 30  ) h@xmath0 images of several regions along g159 s optical limb were obtained in february 2010 with a backside illuminated 2048 x 2048 site ccd detector attached to the mcgraw - hill 1.3  m telescope at the mdm observatory ( mdm ) at kitt peak .",
    "typical exposure times were 1000 to 2000 s. the ccd s 24 micron size pixels gave an image scale of @xmath6 and a field of view of approximately @xmath7 square .",
    "however , to improve the signal - to - noise of the detected filament emissions , we employed @xmath8 pixel on - chip binning .",
    "follow - up , low - dispersion optical spectra of portions of the detected emission filaments were immediately obtained with a boller & chivens ccd spectrograph ( ccds ) on the hiltner 2.4  m telescope at mdm observatory with a 1.2@xmath9 5@xmath10 slit and a 150 lines mm@xmath4 4700   blaze grating which yielded @xmath11   resolution .",
    "standard pipeline data reduction of these images and spectra was performed using iraf / stsdas .",
    "this included debiasing , flat - fielding using twilight sky flats , and dark frame corrections for the images .",
    "vtss image of the emission shell g159.6 + 7.3 . ]",
    "figure 1 shows the g159 emission shell as it appears on the low angular resolution ( @xmath12 per pixel ) virginia tech spectral line survey ( vtss ) of the galactic plane .",
    "the shell is approximately @xmath1 in angular size and appears nearly complete except for breaks along its fainter southeastern limb .",
    "the shell s h@xmath0 flux is extremely weak and is just above the vtss h@xmath0 emission measure limit of @xmath13 @xmath14 pc along much of its structure .",
    "although no filamentary structure is discernible on vtss image , our higher resolution h@xmath0 images of two regions along the shell s eastern limb ( see fig .",
    "2 ) did reveal several faint filaments .",
    "these images ( see figs .  3 & 4 ) show an unresolved overlapping filamentary morphology strikingly similar to that seen in balmer dominated filaments found in galactic snrs where the sn generated interstellar shocks move through a partially neutral medium @xcite .      the long , curved filament shown in figure 3",
    "is seen to split up into several thin , fainter and partially overlapping filaments along either end of the region shown . at these ends ,",
    "the filamentary emission fades significantly , gradually becoming undetectable even in 2000 s long exposures a few arc minutes away from the region shown . a second , much shorter but more highly curved filament is visible in the lower left - hand side of the image .    the somewhat brighter , n - s aligned filament located in the extreme easterly region of the shell s limb ( see fig .",
    "4 ) also showed multiple and partially overlapping thin filaments , only in this case one also finds considerable surrounding diffuse emission .",
    "the nature of this diffuse emission is unclear but its locations near these filaments suggest a possible connection to the shell . despite equally deep h@xmath0 images taken of several other regions of the shell , including the relatively bright region along the northwestern limb",
    ", no similar filamentary emission was detected .",
    "follow - up , low - dispersion optical spectra of the shell s h@xmath0 filaments are consistent with a balmer dominated shock interpretation and thus support an snr identification . in figure 5",
    ", we present our low - dispersion optical spectrum taken of the bright portion of the short filament seen in the southeastern corner of figure 3 . the only emission line seen in its spectrum",
    "is that of narrow ( unresolved ) h@xmath0 line emission with no appreciable [ ] @xmath156300,6364 , [ ] @xmath157319,7330 , [ ] @xmath154959,5007 , [ ] @xmath156548,6583 , or [ ] @xmath156716,6731 emission detected like that commonly present in photoionized gas ( e.g. , h ii regions and planetary nebulae ) or optical shock filaments @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission exhibited a blueshift of @xmath3 km s@xmath4 and a flux of @xmath16 erg s@xmath4 @xmath17 .",
    "a marginal detection of h@xmath18 can be seen in the spectrum suggestive of an h@xmath0/h@xmath18 ratio @xmath19 4 implying an @xmath20 .",
    "such a weak detection of h@xmath18 emission is consistent with a fairly low amount of extinction of around @xmath21 toward g159 suggested from h  i measurements taken in this direction and conversions of n(h ) into @xmath22 values for a typical gas to dust ratio @xcite .",
    "a spectrum was also taken of the roughly n - s aligned filament shown in figure 4 .",
    "again only a weak detection of unresolved h@xmath0 emission was seen , with no detectable [ ] @xmath156548,6583 or [ ] emissions despite integrations of up to one hour .",
    "as before , unresolved h@xmath0 emission was seen with roughly the same blueshifted velocity as the other filament , namely @xmath3 km s@xmath4 .",
    "both the morphology and spectra of the optical filaments seen in regions 1 and 2 ( figs",
    ".  3 & 4 ) are consistent with a balmer dominated shock interpretation .",
    "consequently , we propose that these optical filaments indicate that the large g159 emission shell is a previously unrecognized galactic supernova remnant . considering these filaments locations along the edge of the large h@xmath0 shell , the observed blueshifted velocities of the h@xmath0 emission suggest shock velocities in excess of @xmath23200 km s@xmath4 .",
    "although there is no reported nonthermal radio emission suggesting the presence of a snr , the shell s location of more than seven degrees off the galactic plane , and hence maybe in a region of relatively low interstellar density , may account for the lack of reported associated radio emission .      with shock velocities above 200 km s@xmath4 implied by our optical spectra , some associated x - ray emission , albeit weak , is anticipated and we have possibly found faint associated x - ray emission to the g159 shell . examination of on - line _ rosat _ all sky survey data ( g180p00r5b120pm.fits ) , shows the possible presence of extremely faint diffuse emission coincident with the shell s central region .",
    "this is shown in figure 6 where we present in the upper panel a wide , low angular resolution _",
    "rosat _ 0.5 - 2.0 kev image of the g159 region with several well - known , neighboring galactic snrs marked . in the lower panels of figure 6 ,",
    "we show smaller regions centered on g159 of the vtss h@xmath0 image ( left ) and the _ rosat _ image ( right ) .    while there are several other similar or even brighter extended emission patches within the large galactic plane region shown in _",
    "rosat _ 0.5 - 2.0 kev image ( fig",
    ". 6 , upper panel ) which are not know to be associated with any galactic snrs , the rough coincidence of this faint emission patch ( barely 2@xmath24 above the x - ray background level immediately around it ) with g159 s central region is nonetheless interesting .",
    "such an x - ray morphology would be consistent with that of a highly evolved snr where the x - ray emission appears centrally filled @xcite .",
    "although the x - ray flux from this emission patch is far too weak with which to produce a meaningful x - ray spectrum , its positional coincidence , size , and alignment with the g159 shell lends additional , albeit weak , support to g159 s snr identification .",
    "although exceedingly faint , this new snr exhibits several interesting properties .",
    "it would be only the second recently discovered optical snr and would support reich et al.s ( 1979 ) suggestion that many other high latitude snrs could have escaped radio detection and identification .",
    "the remnant would also rank among the very largest galactic snrs known in angular size and have exceptionally weak radio emission .    in the current catalog of the 275 known galactic snrs",
    ", g159 has no analogue in the sense that it is not the young remnant of a historic sn ( like tycho or sn 1006 ) yet shows only balmer dominated optical emission filaments , a property mainly seen in young snrs .",
    "this raises questions about its age : is it really old as its large size would suggest with balmer dominated filaments much like those seen in parts of the cygnus loop , or could it be just a few 1000 yr old and thus be a larger , older version of the sn 1006 remnant ? the sn 1006 remnant is expanding in a very low density interstellar medium resulting in a high shock velocity suppressing the formation of common postshock optical cooling filaments .",
    "although g159 s distance is unknown , we estimate an upper limit to its distance of @xmath25 2 kpc based on arguments regarding its likely maximum physical size . with angular dimensions of @xmath1 ,",
    "g159 is about the same angular size of the cygnus loop which lies at an estimated distance of @xmath25 0.54 kpc @xcite .",
    "if g159 is physically smaller and hence closer than the cygnus loop , then it would rank among the nearest snrs known , perhaps just behind the gum and vela remnants at @xmath26 kpc .",
    "if , on the other hand , g159 lies farther away than 1 kpc , its size would substantially exceed that of the cygnus loop and have a diameter in excess of @xmath27 pc . from an observational perspective",
    "that there are few remnants with physical diameters greater than about @xmath28 pc @xcite , and theoretical considerations for the radiative expansion phase at diameters around @xmath29 pc or less @xcite , we suggest g159 lies at a distance less than 2.5 kpc",
    ". a range of @xmath30 kpc would place it at a distance much like the @xmath31 kpc estimated for its brighter neighboring snr , g156.2 + 5.7 @xcite .",
    "that remnant is somewhat unusual in that it exhibits , in addition to several ordinary radiative shock filaments , an extensive set of balmer dominated filaments @xcite , possibly for the same reason as in g159 , namely an expansion into large and relatively low density ism regions .",
    "regardless of its actual distance , g159 is an interesting object .",
    "being likely one of the larger galactic snrs known , the lack of reported radio emission from its shell is consistent with snr evolutionary models which predict a rapid drop in radio emission in the radiative phase @xcite and observations of extragalactic snrs which suggest weak radio emission for snrs expanding in low density media @xcite .",
    "however , the presence of optical balmer dominated filaments raises the question of how such a large and presumably old snr has managed to avoid producing any significant optical radiative emission along virtually its entire large shell structure .",
    "our failure to detect any filamentary emission except along the northeastern rim might mean that its shock velocity is generally less than 70 km s@xmath4 and hence too weak to generate strong optical emission . however , the true cause of the paucity of optical filaments , radiative or nonradiative , is currently unknown . in any case , further study of this newly identified remnant may help resolve its overall properties which , in turn , may lead to a better estimate of the number of undetected old , radio and x - ray faint snrs located well off the galactic plane .",
