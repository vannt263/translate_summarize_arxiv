    "evidence has been accumulating for the arrival of @xmath1 gev - tev gamma rays in coincidence with low - energy ( @xmath2 mev ) gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "for example , _ egret _ detected seven grbs which emitted high energy photons in the @xmath3 mev to 18 gev range @xcite .",
    "there have also been results suggestive of gamma rays beyond the gev range @xcite , although these were not claimed as firm detections .",
    "evidence has also been reported for tev emission in one burst out of 54 _ batse _ grbs in the field of view of the _ milagrito _ detector @xcite . in another paper",
    "@xcite reported suggestive evidence for sub - tev gamma rays arriving in coincidence with grbs which occurred near zenith above the gamma ray astrophysics at notre dame ( _ grand _ ) air shower array . in that experiment ,",
    "most of the eight bursts analyzed were associated with at least some marginal excess ( @xmath4 ) of muons including the event detected by _",
    "milagrito_. one burst evidenced a possible detection at the @xmath5 level .",
    "as shown in @xcite , if this detection is real , then the output in energetic gammas is likely to dominate the energetics of the burst .",
    "although these data are not overwhelmingly convincing , they are at least suggestive that detectable energetic tev gamma rays might be associated with low - energy gamma - ray bursts @xcite",
    ". moreover , these new detections , if real , can not be explained by a simple extrapolation of the _ batse _ spectrum @xcite , particularly if intergalactic absorption is taken into account @xcite .",
    "a new @xmath1 tev component in the grb spectrum seems to be required .",
    "the present work is therefore an attempt to interpret these new possible detections in the context of three models , which might be proposed for the production of tev gammas in a grb .",
    "these are : 1 ) inverse - compton scattering of ambient photons from relativistic electrons in the burst environment ; 2 ) proton - synchrotron emission @xcite ; and 3 ) inelastic scattering of relativistic protons from ambient photons creating high - energy neutral pions , which decay into high - energy photons @xcite .",
    "we here briefly outline the underlying physics and characteristic energetic gamma - ray spectra associated with each of these possible models .",
    "we then derive limits on the parameters of these models based upon the detection limits from the project _ grand _ array .",
    "based upon this , we conclude that it is difficult for any of these models to satisfy the energetic requirements unless the photon beaming angle is very narrow for the high - energy component . of the models considered , the most likely are inverse - compton scattering or proton - synchrotron emission .",
    "we note , however , that these conclusions rely upon a few assumptions .",
    "for example , we have assumed that the low- and high - energy gamma rays are produced at the same location ; that the time variability of the high - energy component can be estimated from the fwhm of the highest peak in the low - energy gamma ray light curve ; and that the variability - luminosity relation of fenimore & ramirez - ruiz ( 2000 ) gives a reliable estimate of the redshifts of these bursts .",
    "we explore the impact of each of these assumptions and find that , unless the bursts occur at very low redshifts ( @xmath0 ) , the energetic requirements remain difficult to satisfy .",
    "the mystery of the astrophysical origin for low - energy gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) has been with us for some time . as of yet there is no consensus explanation , although there is mounting evidence for an association with supernovae @xcite .",
    "a likely scenario is a burst environment involving collisions of an ultra relativistic @xmath6 plasma fireball @xcite .",
    "these fireballs may produce low - energy gamma rays either by `` internal '' collisions of multiple shocks @xcite , or by `` external '' collisions of a single shock with ambient interstellar material @xcite .    in either of these paradigms it is possible for very energetic gammas to be produced through inverse - compton scattering of ambient photons off the relativistic electrons .",
    "furthermore , it seems likely that baryons would be accelerated along with the pair plasma to very high energies @xcite .",
    "synchrotron emission from energetic protons @xcite or possibly hadro - production of pions in the burst environment @xcite and subsequent @xmath7 gamma decay could also lead to an additional spectral component of very energetic gammas . in any case",
    ", it is at least plausible that energetic gammas could arrive in coincidence with a gamma - ray burst .",
    "this was the premise of project _ grand _ s search for high - energy gammas arriving in coincidence with _",
    "batse _ grb observations .",
    "it is also possible , however , that low- and high - energy gamma - ray components are generated in different regions or phases of a burst .",
    "this could lead to substantially different arrival times for each component .",
    "this was in fact the case for the 18 gev photon observed by _",
    "egret _ , which arrived @xmath8 s after the low - energy emission had ended .",
    "observations of tev gammas could provide important clues as to the baryon loading , lorentz factor , and ambient magnetic field of the relativistic fireball .",
    "our goal in this paper is to constrain the possible spectrum and source of energetic photons using the project _ grand _ data .",
    "hence , we restrict ourselves to considering high - energy gammas produced concurrently with low - energy gammas consistent with the search technique employed by project _ grand_.",
    "table [ batsetab ] summarizes some of the features of the _ batse _ and project _ grand _ observations of the eight grbs analyzed in @xcite , where a detailed explanation of the project _ grand _ results can be found . in the present paper",
    ", we will denote quantities in the frame of the observer by the superscript `` @xmath9 '' .",
    "we will also use @xmath10 to denote the low energy grb photons and distinguish them from the high - energy component , denoted @xmath11 .",
    "the observed _ batse _ spectra are fit with a broken power law of the form @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 mev is the break energy of the observed spectrum .",
    "although these bursts are often better fit by using an exponential to join the two components , a broken power law is adequate for the present discussion .",
    "it maintains a simple analytic form for the equations , and as we shall see , the precise low energy form is almost irrelevant as long as a break energy exists . in",
    "what follows we will use values of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 derived from optimum fits to the _ batse _ spectra for all events except the _ milagrito _ event for which the _ batse _ fluence was too weak to obtain a reliable spectral fit .",
    "the _ batse _",
    "fit parameters corresponding to equation ( [ batsespec ] ) are listed in table [ gammaraytab ] .",
    "the fit parameters for these bursts were provided at our request by m. s. briggs at the marshall space flight center .",
    "we also include the variability time scale @xmath20 for these bursts , which was estimated as the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the brightest peak in each light curve .",
    "the light curves of grbs typically show a wide range of timescale variability , so this choice may not be justified . in  [ sec : results ] we explore the dependence of our conclusions on a wide range of values for @xmath20 .    in table",
    "[ ztab ] , we give estimated redshifts for each burst .",
    "grb 990123 is the only burst in this group for which an optical counterpart was detected .",
    "this burst , therefore , is known to have occurred at a redshift of @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the redshifts for most of the remaining bursts were estimated using the variability - luminosity relation of @xcite .",
    "this method relies on the apparent correlation between the time variability of a burst , which can be measured from its light curve , and the absolute luminosity of the burst , which we wish to infer .",
    "this provides us with a straightforward method for converting grb observables into luminosities and redshifts @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we first fit a quadratic polynomial to the background in the non - burst portions of the _ batse _ 64 ms four channel data ( i.e. dissc data ) .",
    "let @xmath22 be the binned background counts from this polynomial fit . if @xmath23 are the observed binned counts during the actual burst event , then the net count is @xmath24 .",
    "we then rebin the counts by dilating the time samples by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the redshift we wish to estimate and @xmath27 is a baseline redshift .",
    "following @xcite , we take @xmath28 .",
    "the new , dilated net counts , @xmath29 , represent what the time history would look like at @xmath30 .",
    "the variability is then defined to be the average mean - square of the variations in @xmath29 relative to a smoothed time history , as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the peak of the dilated net count during the burst and @xmath33 is the count smoothed with a square - wave window with a length equal to 15% of the duration of the burst .",
    "the @xmath34 term corrects the variability for the energy - dependence of the time scale of a grb @xcite . the @xmath35 term ( dilated background counts in a sample ) accounts for the poisson noise . the sum is taken over the @xmath36 samples that exceed the background by at least @xmath37 .",
    "the estimated variabilities are listed in table [ ztab ] .    based upon the fits of @xcite",

    "we can now iteratively solve equations ( [ veq]-[aveeq ] ) until the estimate for @xmath26 converges .",

    "both luminosity estimates are listed in table [ ztab ] for each burst .",
    "grb 970417a was the one burst ( of 54 in the field of view ) for which the _ milagrito _ collaboration reported evidence of tev emission during the duration of this burst within the _ batse _ error circle @xcite .",

    "interestingly , this was a relatively weak _ batse _ burst with a fluence of @xmath64 erg @xmath65 in all four _ batse _ energy channels ( @xmath66 kev ) .",

    "we can then use these average parameters and the observed flux to fix the normalization , @xmath16 .",
    "the weak signal in the _ batse _ band also prevents us from using the variability - luminosity relation described above to determine the redshift of this burst .",
    "instead we adopt @xmath70 based upon the analysis of @xcite .",
    "one possible source for energetic gamma rays is the inverse - compton ( ic ) scattering of low - energy ambient photons by relativistic electrons .",
    "indeed , such ic photons are thought to be the source of observed high - energy photons from active galactic nuclei such as mk-421 @xcite .",
    "the inverse - compton - scattering spectrum is generally written as @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the spectrum of electrons characteristic of a fermi mechanism , @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a normalization constant and @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "the flux of the synchrotron photons @xmath76 is @xmath77 where @xmath78 . evaluating the integrals , we arrive at the simplified expression @xmath79 where the spectral index @xmath80 is given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the electron spectral index and @xmath83 is the energy scale at which the electron cooling time becomes comparable to the system lifetime .",

    "the relation between the compton - scattered photon energy and @xmath85 in the observer s frame is @xmath93 , where again @xmath94 is the energy of the _ batse _ photons in the observer s frame . for simplicity we will take @xmath95",
    "therefore , the cooling break energy can be written as @xmath96    relativistic klein - nishina ( kn ) corrections to the compton spectrum may be important in the grb environment over some range of energies . for completeness",
    "we include these by introducing a parameter @xmath97 . when @xmath98 , the kn effect is important .",
    "we adopt @xmath99 as the the lower boundary of the kn regime .",
    "this implies a lower limit to the observed gamma energy at which the kn effects should be considered , @xmath100 in the kn regime the emissivity of ic radiation per electron is independent of the electron energy and the cooling time becomes proportional to the electron energy ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the emissivity is reduced by a factor of @xmath101 compared with the classical ic formula ( see eq . [ [ fic ] ] ) , and the observed photon energy is @xmath102 .",
    "we can thus define the cooling frequency in the kn regime , by setting @xmath103 .",
    "this gives @xmath104 where we have used @xmath105 for the observed compton - scattered photon energy .    in the kn regime ,",

    ". the resultant ic gamma - ray spectrum should cut off above @xmath113 due to the cut - off in the spectrum of ultra - relativistic electrons at energies above @xmath114 .",
    "it is generally believed that the expanding plasma contains at least some baryons .",
    "indeed , some baryons within the jet are required to increase the burst duration and luminosity ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the region where the electrons are accelerated",
    ", protons may also be accelerated up to ultra - high energies @xmath115 ev @xcite producing a spectrum characteristic of a fermi mechanism , ( eq . [ [ fermi ] ] ) .    the possibility of energetic protons producing @xmath1tev gammas by synchrotron emission has been discussed in a number of papers @xcite .",
    "this mechanism has the desirable characteristic that the low - energy photons produced by electron - synchrotron emission and the high - energy photons from energetic protons can be produced simultaneously in the same environment @xcite .    in this model",

    "this source of gamma rays seems unlikely due to the fact that it results from a secondary strong interaction and therefore has a small cross - section relative to electromagnetic interactions .",
    "nevertheless an estimate of this spectrum is straightforward , so we include it here",
    ". another alternative possibility might be pion production via proton - proton collisions ( cf . * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , the proton density in the frame of the shock must be small to ensure a low optical depth for gammas .",
    "hence , @xmath139 collisions are favored over @xmath140 , although as we will show , even this preferred reaction places unreasonable energetic requirements on the burst environment .",
    "following @xcite , the energy loss rate due to pion production is @xmath141 where @xmath142 gev is the threshold for pion production . in the first integral , @xmath143 is the cross section for pion production due to a collision with a photon of energy @xmath10 in the rest frame of the proton , and @xmath144 is the average fractional energy lost to the pion .",

    "we have ignored the effects of these decay products on the emerging gamma - ray spectrum .",
    "for neutrinos this is reasonable since there is very little chance of them interacting further .",
    "the positrons , however , may influence the gamma - ray spectrum through positron - synchrotron radiation @xcite or pair annihilation .",

    "then the optical depth can be approximated as @xmath206}{d \\epsilon_\\gamma } \\frac{\\delta t } { \\gamma(1+z ) } ~ , \\label{tauggeq}\\ ] ] where @xmath207 is the width of the emitting region as measured in the shock frame .",
    "this formula is similar to that of @xcite , except that this form takes into account the spectral break in the low - energy grb photons .",
    "this break is important since it implies that the optical depth is proportional to @xmath208 for @xmath209 gev , but roughly constant for higher energies .",
    "the @xcite result is only valid in the lower energy range .",
    "the proper energy dependence is important because the internal optical depth can be of order unity . in the case of grb 971110",
    ", the internal optical depth at 100 gev is @xmath210 implying that some energetic gammas could emerge .",
    "the thin lines in figure [ figsource ] show how the three source spectra normalized to fit grb 971110 would be modified by internal absorption .",
    "the change in the energy dependence of the internal optical depth is apparent above about 50 gev . for the remainder of the bursts",
    ", we were unable to place meaningful constraints on the internal optical depth due to large uncertainties in the fit parameters , particularly @xmath17 and @xmath211 .",
    "for these bursts , we have taken the very optimistic assumption of @xmath212 .",
    "another important constraint on the observed burst spectra comes from the absorption of photons via pair production during collisions with the intergalactic infrared background . in this work",
    "we use a calculated optical depth for intergalactic absorption based upon the standard formulation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we use a model for the luminosity evolution of background light from @xcite .",
    "the dust emission component is calculated assuming a dust emission spectrum similar to that of the solar neighborhood .",
    "the fraction of light absorbed by dust is adjusted to reproduce the observed far infrared background from cobe @xcite .",
    "this method is summarized in @xcite .",
    "it is consistent with other optical - depth calculations ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the resultant @xmath202 pairs may then further modify the original gamma - ray spectrum by providing a medium for some of the remaining gamma rays to undergo intergalactic inverse - compton scattering .",
    "this process results in complicated showers of secondary electrons and gammas .",
    "these secondary gammas may be observed , but over a much longer time - scale , since much of this secondary light traverses a longer path length .",
    "the flux from these secondary gamma rays is probably below the detection threshold of current arrays such as project _",
    "grand_. nevertheless , this might be a noteworthy effect .",
    "figure [ figobs ] shows final spectra in the observer s frame when both internal and intergalactic absorption are taken into account , assuming the burst is arriving from a redshift of @xmath213 ( appropriate for grb 971110 ) . even though the source spectra are vastly different , the observed high - energy gamma spectra are quite similar .",
    "hence , the implied source energy requirement may be the only way to distinguish between the models . for illustration , figure [ figobs ] also includes the observed _ batse _ spectrum for this burst , fit with both the band ( eq . [ [ batsespec ] ] ) and electron - synchrotron models .",
    "in this work we use the muon observations of project _ grand _ to fix the normalization ( or upper limit ) in each of the models described above for the various bursts analyzed .",
    "that is , the spectral shape is fixed from equations ( [ pispec ] ) , ( [ synspec ] ) , or ( [ icspec ] ) , and the number of muons expected is then computed using @xmath214 where @xmath215 is the collecting area of the project _ grand _ array ( the effective area at the time of grb 971110 was approximately @xmath216 @xmath151 ) , @xmath217 is the primary gamma - ray detection threshold for project _ grand _ ( @xmath218 gev ) , and",
    "@xmath219 is the probability per primary for a muon to reach detection level at project _ grand_.",
    "this probability ( valid for @xmath220 gev ) was computed by @xcite using the monte carlo atmospheric absorption code , _",
    "fluka_. here @xmath221 includes both the internal and intergalactic optical depth estimated for each burst as described above",
    ". for illustration , table [ optdeptab ] summarizes some estimates of the relative magnitudes of internal and intergalactic optical depths at two energy scales , 100 gev and 1 tev .    in practice ,",
    "the integral in equation ( [ nmueq ] ) is cut off at @xmath222 tev since the optical depth is quite high for photons above this energy .",
    "the normalization constants for each model are then adjusted so that @xmath223 agrees with the @xmath224 upper limits set by project _",
    "grand _ , except for grb 971110 where we used the observed mean value ( see table [ batsetab ] ) .",
    "here we adopt typical values for the degree of equipartition @xmath119 and the relativistic lorentz factor @xmath211 , namely @xmath225 and @xmath226 .",
    "below we explore the dependence of our results on a broad range of these parameters .",
    "we can then use our normalized gamma spectra to estimate the total energy emitted in high - energy gammas at the source .",
    "for the inverse - compton model , we can also estimate the energy emitted in electrons , noting again the characteristic spectrum of a fermi mechanism given in equation ( [ fermi ] ) .",
    "similarly we can estimate the energy emitted in protons for the proton - synchrotron and photo - pion models .",
    "implied energies for photon emission into @xmath227 are given in tables [ ictab ] , [ psynctab ] , and [ photoptab ] for the inverse - compton , proton - synchrotron , and photo - pion models , respectively .",
    "we also list the required energies of the source protons or electrons , as appropriate .",
    "our results assume @xmath190 for the accelerated electron and proton spectra . for grb 971110",
    "we estimated the statistical uncertainties of our results using monte carlo techniques to explore the parameter space of each of the models assuming gaussian error distributions .    as evidenced by the large uncertainties ,",
    "the models are not well constrained at present .",
    "nevertheless , several points are worth noting from the tables . for the most significant possible detection ( grb 971110 ) ,",
    "the energetic requirements for the ic model ( @xmath228 erg ) and the proton - synchrotron model ( @xmath229 erg ) are much less than that for a photo - pion mechanism ( @xmath230 erg ) , as expected .",
    "the distinction between the inverse - compton and proton - synchrotron mechanisms has an important consequence on the magnetic field of the grb , specifically the degree of equipartition , @xmath119 . in the case of inverse - compton scattering ,",
    "the ratio of the inverse - compton luminosity @xmath231 to electron - synchrotron luminosity @xmath232 should be equal to the ratio of the ic target photon energy density @xmath121 to the magnetic field energy density @xmath233 since both mechanisms arise from the same population of hot relativistic electrons .",
    "thus , @xmath234 where @xmath235 and @xmath117 is the total rest - frame energy density of the emission region .",
    "if we adopt the generally accepted view that the @xmath1mev gamma rays seen by _ batse _ are caused by electron - synchrotron radiation then @xmath236 . for grb 971110 , @xmath237 , which implies @xmath238",
    "since the energy density of the @xmath1mev _ batse _ gamma rays is likely to be higher than any other radiation source available for inverse - compton scattering , we identify this energy density as @xmath121 .",
    "this association has been implicit throughout this paper . on the other hand , since @xmath239 the energy density of the @xmath1tev gamma rays must be greater than @xmath121 by about @xmath240 .",
    "we can then use @xmath241 as a lower limit for the total rest - frame energy density @xmath117 . combining this with eq .",
    "( [ xibu ] ) we get the following upper limit on the degree of equipartition @xmath242 note also that eq .",
    "( [ lratio ] ) holds only in the classical regime . in the kn regime",
    "@xmath119 is even smaller because inverse - compton scattering becomes less efficient .",
    "hence , the inverse - compton model is at odds with models that propose grbs as the source of ultra - high energy cosmic rays , since those models require a magnetic field near equipartition , @xmath243 ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in figures",
    "[ figgam ] , [ figxi ] , and [ figdt ] we explore the dependence of our results upon a broad range of possible values for @xmath211 , @xmath119 , and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "these uncertainties were not formally included in our statistical estimates .",
    "nevertheless , these figures support our qualitative conclusions . specifically , the energetic requirements of all three models are in excess of that for the grb for a broad range of parameters .",
    "indeed most parameter variations in figures [ figgam ] - [ figdt ] only exacerbate this problem",
    ". however , the inverse - compton and proton - synchrotron mechanisms are generally less sensitive to changes in @xmath211 over the range @xmath244 or changes in @xmath20 over the range @xmath245 .",
    "the sharp increase in the energy content of the protons and electrons at small @xmath211 enters primarily through the internal optical depth .",
    "figure [ figxi ] shows that the proton - synchrotron mechanism is highly efficient over a fairly broad range of @xmath119 ( @xmath246 ) .",
    "regardless of the mechanism , if grb 971110 is indeed a detection and our estimated redshift of @xmath247 is valid , the implied energy in energetic ( @xmath248 gev ) gamma rays is more than 100 times higher than the energy in the low - energy gamma rays .",
    "this renders the already challenging energetic requirements on the grb source engine to be even more difficult . it may be possible to alleviate this difficulty if , perhaps , the photon beaming angle is much narrower for the high - energy component than for the low - energy grb",
    "another possibility is that the redshift is much lower than our estimated value for this burst . in figure [ figz ]",
    "we explore the energetic requirements for grb 971110 over a very broad range of redshifts from 0.005 to 3 .",
    "this range is consistent with most currently measured grb redshifts .",
    "this figure illustrates quite clearly the critical role that intergalactic absorption plays in driving up the energetic requirements and highlights the need for accurately determining the true redshifts of grbs .",
    "we have analyzed the eight grbs discussed in @xcite , which occurred above the project _ grand _ array .",
    "we have studied the implied energies in energetic ( @xmath1tev ) gamma rays ( and associated electrons and protons ) of such grbs in the context of three possible mechanisms : inverse - compton scattering , proton - synchrotron radiation , and photo - pion production .",
    "our analysis suggest that all of these models face significant energetic requirements .",
    "gamma - ray production by either inverse - compton scattering or proton - synchrotron radiation is probably the most efficient process .",
    "although it can not be claimed that tev gammas have unambiguously been detected in association with low - energy grbs , we have argued that there is enough mounting evidence to warrant further study .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that if tev gammas continue to be observed , then they present some interesting dilemmas for grb physics . in view of their potential as a probe of the grb source environment",
