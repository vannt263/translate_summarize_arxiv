    "the spreading of fluids on solid surfaces constitutes a significant field of research into the processes met in nature , biology and modern industry .",
    "interfacial phenomena relating to gas - liquid - solid systems take into account contact angles and contact lines which are formed at the intersection of two immiscible fluids and a solid .",
    "the interaction between the three materials in the immediate vicinity of the contact line has great effects on the statics and dynamics of flows ( dussan , @xcite ) .",
    "many observations associated with the motion of two fluids in contact with a solid wall were performed ( bataille , @xcite ; dussan and davis , @xcite ; dussan , ram and garoff , @xcite ; pomeau , @xcite ) . according to the advance or the recede of a fluid on a wall",
    ", we observe the existence of an apparent dynamic contact angle when a contact line is moving .",
    "this angle , named after young , depends on the celerity of the contact line , and the motion in the vicinity of the contact line does not seem to be influenced by the behaviour of the total flow ( bazhelakov and chesters , @xcite ; blake , bracke and shikhmurzaev , @xcite ) . it is noteworthy that since young s article on capillarity , @xcite , the understanding of these phenomena has remained incomplete . for example , it is well known that for newtonian fluids the total dissipation and the interface curvature at the contact line are infinite ( huh and scriven , @xcite ; dussan and davis , @xcite ; pukhnachev and solonnikov , @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , fundamental questions remain unanswered . among these",
    "are the following : what is the kinematics of the contact line ? can the fluid velocity fields be multivalued on this line ? what is the work of the dissipative forces in its vicinity ?",
    "is there slip of the contact line on the solid wall ? what is the connection between apparent and intrinsic contact angles",
    "? there are various ways to overcome these difficulties : to consider the slip length on the solid wall ( hocking , @xcite ; shikhmurzaev , @xcite ) , to consider one phase as a perfect fluid , the possibility of a thin film as a precursor film on a wall ( de gennes , @xcite ) , the assumption of dynamic surface tension different from the static counterpart ( shikhmurzaev , @xcite ) , the use of non - linear capillary theories such as cahn and hilliard s theory of capillarity ( seppecher , @xcite ) , or the direct computation of flows by means of molecular models ( koplick , banavar and willemsen , @xcite ) .",
    "all these attempts are not able to produce a complete satisfactory answer to the previous questions .",
    "it was noticed by using molecular methods that large amplitude shearing rates reveal a tendency to reorganize the liquid , to facilitate the flow and to reduce the viscosity .",
    "this suggests that in reality there may be rheological anomalies around the contact line ( heyes _ et al _ , @xcite ; holian and evans , @xcite ; ryckaert _ et al _ , @xcite ) .    for condensed matter and far from critical conditions , interfaces which are transition layers of the size of a few angstrms between fluids or between a fluid and a solid can be modelled by surfaces endowed with a capillary energy ( rowlinson and widom , @xcite ) .",
    "solid walls are rough on a molecular or even microscopic scale . moreover , the chemical inhomogeneity due to the nature of the solid or the presence of surfactants changes the surface tension in a drastic way .",
    "nevertheless , roughness for example is taken into account by corrections of the measurement on a mean geometric surface ( wenzel equation in cox , @xcite or wolansky and marmur , @xcite ) .",
    "the motion of liquids in contact with a solid wall will be considered in this paper within the framework of continuum mechanics .",
    "knowledge of the equations and boundary conditions which govern the movements of liquids in contact with solid walls and control of the contact line motion are the aim of our study.we propose a model of the dynamics of wetting for slow movements . to prove its accuracy , we are only considering _ partial wetting _ when the balance contact angle is theoretically defined without ambiguity ( de gennes , brochard - wyart and qur , @xcite ) .",
    "the liquids are non - newtonian ; so the viscous stress tensor deviates from the navier - stokes model for large values of the strain rate tensor . for two - dimensional flows , and in the lubrication approximation",
    ", the streamlines have an analytic representation and it is possible to obtain the flows near the contact line .",
    "equations of motion , boundary conditions and some consequences on the contact angle behaviour are deduced .",
    "the notation is that of ordinary cartesian tensor analysis ( serrin , @xcite ) . in a fixed coordinate system ,",
    "the components of a vector ( covector )  @xmath0 are denoted by @xmath1 , ( @xmath2 ) , where @xmath3 . in order to describe the fluid motion analytically",

    "the vector @xmath9 denotes the fluid velocity .",

    "it was shown that the equations of motions and boundary conditions lead to streamlines near the contact line similar to those of a newtonian fluid endowed with a dynamic viscosity which is , when the strain rate tensor tends to zero , the limit of the dynamic viscosity of the non - newtonian fluid .",
    "the analyze of the stress tensor and the dissipative function near the contact line leads to several remarks and conclusions :    for dissipative movements , a viscous stress tensor @xmath473 was added to the pressure term and in the expression of virtual work , the dissipative terms were distributed within the volume as @xmath474 and on the surfaces as @xmath475 . in magnitude , the surface tension is comparable with the bulk stress despite the fact that the thickness of the interfacial layer , where the surface tension acts , is negligible compared to the characteristic length scale in the bulk : although the interfacial layer is very thin , the intermolecular forces which act on it and give rise to the surface tension are very strong so that the result is finite .",
    "huge variations of the fluid velocity appear at the three - phase contact line . the only physical factor , which achieves to _ magnify _ its role , does not come from intermolecular forces but from the _ discontinuity _ of the velocity at the contact line and consequently from the viscosity along the contact line when the thickness of the contact line region tends to zero . in the immediate vicinity of the contact line , the viscous stresses yield a friction force which acts on the fluid - fluid interface and",
    "is balanced by strong capillary tensions associated with the curvature of the fluid - fluid interface .",
    "consequently , expression ( 23 ) introduces a new term associated with the contact line @xmath15 .",

    "this result , in agreement with experiments and molecular investigations , is brought out by means of the analytic representation of the streamlines on newtonian behaviour ; _ however , other non - newtonian fluid behaviour is used to arrive at bounded dissipative functions near the contact line . _    for slow movements we are able to give a model which provides answers to the previous questions :    - the contact line is a non material line and acts in a similar way as a _ shock line_.    - the velocity fields are multivalued on the line .    - the paradox of infinite viscous dissipation is removed .    - adherence and boundary conditions on surfaces and interfaces are preserved , but a dynamic young - dupr relation derived by the virtual work principle yields the apparent dynamic contact angle as an implicit function of the contact line celerity .",
    "the apparent dynamic contact angle is the only pertinent young angle from a continuum mechanics point of view .    - for partial wetting , and for a sufficiently small capillary number , the concept of line friction is associated with the apparent contact angle .",
