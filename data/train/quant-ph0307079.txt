    "the problem of a point particle , restricted to a circular radius , and subject to a uniform gravitational ( or electric ) field , namely a rigid pendulum , is one of the most familiar of all problems in classical mechanics .",
    "the corresponding quantum version was first considered early in the history of quantum mechanics by condon @xcite and is sometimes discussed in the more physical context of hindered internal rotations @xcite - @xcite in chemistry .",
    "the problem is also a staple of the pedagogical literature @xcite - @xcite and is often seen as an example of perturbation theory methods @xcite - @xcite , especially in collections of problems in quantum mechanics @xcite - @xcite , where is often described as the plane rotator in an electric field .",
    "most treatments focus attention on aspects of the structure of the energy eigenvalues spectrum , with only a handful ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) examining the question of time - dependence of wave packet solutions .",
    "more recently , the realization that important information on longer - term quantum correlations , in the form of wave packet revivals and superrevivals , is also encoded in the energy eigenvalue spectrum , has focused new attention on the time dependence of physical and model systems which exhibit such interesting dynamics . in many such systems , initially localized states which have a short - term , quasi - classical time evolution ,",
    "can spread significantly over several orbits , only to reform later in the form of a quantum revival in which the spreading reverses itself , the wave packet relocalizes , and the semi - classical periodicity is once again evident .",
    "such revival phenomena have been observed in a wide variety of physical systems , especially in rydberg atoms @xcite , @xcite , and calculations exist for many other model systems @xcite .    the archetype of a one - dimensional model system for quantum revivals is the infinite well ( where such revivals are exact ) and a number of analyses @xcite - @xcite have provided insight into both the short - term and long - term behavior of wave packets .",
    "the rigid rotor , which like the infinite well , also has an @xmath2 quantum number dependence in the energy spectrum , behaves very similarly @xcite , @xcite , with neither system exhibiting higher - order correlations ( such as superrevivals ) due to the simplicity of their energy level structure .",
    "harmonic oscillator systems , with a simple spectrum proportional to @xmath3 , do not exhibit quantum revivals ( or rather have @xmath4 ) , or super - revivals , but morse - type generalizations @xcite , @xcite , with anharmonic terms present , have predictable revival structures , as confirmed in observations of molecular systems @xcite .",
    "one - dimensional power - law potentials of the form @xmath5 also provide examples @xcite of interesting quantum revival time behavior as a model parameter is varied , as they interpolate between the cases of the oscillator ( @xmath6 ) and infinite well ( @xmath7 ) limits .",
    "for many such systems , which depend on a single quantum number , one typically expands the energy eigenvalues ( assuming integral values ) about the central value used in the construction of a wave packet via @xmath8 in terms of which the classical period , revival , and superrevival times are given respectively by @xmath9 so that information on the long - term quantum correlations present in many wave packet solutions is encoded in the energy spectrum , just as is the short - term quasi - classical time - dependence . in typical experimental realizations of such systems ,",
    "one finds @xmath10 .    in this report , we will focus on the structure of the quantum revival ( and superrevival ) time for the problem of the quantum pendulum , extending earlier analyses of the approximate energy spectrum for this problem , in both the low- and high - energy limits , as well as making use of numerically obtained values for the entire spectrum .",
    "we are interested in such questions as ( i ) what is the revival time , @xmath11 for the ( anharmonic ) oscillator limit of the quantum pendulum and ( ii ) , how do the quantum revival and superrevival times vary ( from both the low - energy oscillator and high - energy rotor limits ) as one approaches energies near the separatrix value . to probe such questions , we begin , in sec .  [ sec : classical_background ] by defining the generic problem of the quantum pendulum , and review standard expressions for the energy dependence of the classical periodicity of the pendulum , @xmath12 versus @xmath13 .",
    "we then discuss , in sec .",

    "[ sec : high_energy ] and [ sec : low_energy ] , we discuss perturbative solutions to the quantum pendulum problem , in the high energy ( free rotor ) and low energy ( oscillator like ) limits respectively , deriving results up to 4th order in perturbation theory .",
    "we use these results to discuss the classical periodicity , as well as the quantum revivals and superrevivals in these two limiting cases .",
    "finally , we use these earlier results as benchmarks against which to compare the numerical evaluation of the energy eigenvalues for the pendulum over the entire spectrum , focusing on the behavior of @xmath11 and @xmath14 near the top of the pendulum .",
    "some of the mathematical details of the high - energy limit are discussed in a wkb - approximation in appendix  [ sec : wkb_appendix ] , while the details of the perturbative expansion in the low - energy , oscillator - like limit are given in appendix  [ sec : third_and_4th_appendix ] .",
    "for definiteness , we will consider a point particle of mass @xmath15 ( a notation used to avoid confusion with familiar angular momentum quantum numbers ) restricted to a circle of radius @xmath16 , which therefore has a rotational inertia @xmath17 .",
    "it is subject to either a uniform gravitational ( @xmath18 ) or electric ( @xmath19 ) force in the vertical direction , giving rise to a potential energy function of the form @xmath20 ( one can also consider a point electric dipole , @xmath21 , in a uniform electric field , in which case @xmath22 . )    we can rewrite the classical conservation of energy connection @xmath23 in the form @xmath24 or @xmath25 which can , of course , be formally integrated in terms of elliptic integrals ( or evaluated numerically ) to obtain @xmath26 solutions .",

    "the pattern of classical periodicities and quantum revivals in systems characterized by two quantum numbers has been discussed @xcite , @xcite . a more careful study of this case might be motivated by its possible realization in the geometry of carbon nanotubes . a related two - dimensional generalization would be to consider the point object restricted to the surface of a sphere which has a richer set of possible classical motions .",

    "one of us ( r. w. r. ) also thanks h. kaplan for conversations regarding aspects of this problem as well as the organizers of the 2002 gordon conference on physics research and education ( quantum mechanics ) for their hospitality .",
    "we briefly describe in this appendix a simple wkb - based approximation which gives the leading order ( in @xmath103 ) results for the ( approximately degenerate ) characteristic values , @xmath76 , in the high - energy limit ( rotor - like ) of the quantum pendulum problem , as an expansion in powers of @xmath68 . in this context",
    ", it reproduces the leading @xmath103 behavior of well - known handbook results in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite for the characteristic values @xmath181 in terms of the parameter @xmath55 , in a very straightforward way .",
    "we first rewrite the classical energy conservation connection @xmath182 in the form @xmath183 in the spirit of a wkb approach , we quantize the integral of @xmath184 in the form @xmath185 for the physical situation of the quantum pendulum , we would restrict ourselves to even values of @xmath103 , but for comparison to the general result inspired by mathieu equations , we allow any integral @xmath103 values . in terms of the mathieu equation parameters in eqn .",
    "( [ mathieu_parameters ] ) we can write this in the form @xmath186 one can expand the integrand as a series in @xmath187 and perform the angular integrals , leaving only the even terms present , to obtain @xmath188 or @xmath189 this can be solved recursively in powers of @xmath190 to obtain the approximation solution @xmath191 and this form agrees with the handbook results of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "one can then easily extend this result ( again to leading order in @xmath103 ) to quite high order .",
    "for the third - order correction to the low - energy , harmonic oscillator limit , we need to evaluate three distinct contributions , namely , ( i ) the @xmath192 term in first order , ( ii ) the @xmath139 and @xmath126 terms ( in both orders ) in second order , and ( iii ) the @xmath126 , @xmath126 , @xmath126 terms in third order .",
    "for example , the first contribution is @xmath193 \\frac{5(14n^4 + 28n^3 + 70n^2 + 56n+21)}{8!2 ^ 4}\\ ] ] the expression for the third - order energy shift is presented in some elementary texts , but we reproduce it below for completeness , specifically @xmath194 including all three sets of terms , we obtain the result shown in eqn .",

    ", we make use of symbolic manipulation programs ( in our case ) and write @xmath195\\ ] ] and evaluate the required matrix elements of higher powers by repeated matrix multiplication .",
    "we note that in third - order ( and beyond ) in perturbation theory , there are consistently terms including factors of the form @xmath196 . at third - order , and beyond , in intermediate steps of the calculation ,",
    "the individual expressions one obtains may be of higher order ( in @xmath3 ) than are present in the final result , and the presence of such cancellations can be used as a check on the internal consistency of the calculation .    finally , for the 4th - order terms , we require the contributions from ( i ) @xmath197 in first order , ( ii ) @xmath198 ( both orderings ) in second order , ( iii ) @xmath199 , also in second order , ( iv ) , @xmath200 ( three orderings ) in third order , and ( v ) @xmath201 in 4th - order . the explicit expression for the energy shift in 4th order , in terms of unperturbed wavefunctions and energies , is less often seen ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) so we also reproduce it here for completeness .",
    "\\left [ \\sum_{j\\neq n } \\frac { \\langle n|\\hat{h}'|j \\rangle \\langle j|\\hat{h}'|n \\rangle } { ( e_{n}^{(0 ) } - e_{j}^{(0)})^2 } \\right ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as a cross - check of our more automated approach to the 3rd and 4th order calculations , we have followed the same approach for the 1st- and 2nd - order results and confirm that we reproduce the values in eqns .",
    "( [ sho_first ] ) and ( [ sho_second ] ) .",
    "perhaps more interestingly , we also note that there are three simple extensions of the basic oscillator , defined by the zeroth - order potential @xmath203 , which can be used as benchmarks for such higher order calculations .",
    "first of all , the addition of a constant perturbing potential term , @xmath204 , should only affect the energy spectrum through the first - order correction @xmath205 and one can easily check that all higher order corrections vanish in this case .",
    "the inclusion of a linear term of the form @xmath206 can be solved exactly by completing the square giving @xmath207 to give @xmath208 .",
    "thus , the inclusion of an @xmath209 perturbation should find a non - vanishing result only for @xmath210 and we confirm this .",
    "finally , the inclusion of a small quadratic correction to the original oscillator potential by @xmath211 leads to a simple redefinition of the oscillator frequency @xmath212 and the result @xmath213 which can be expanded as an ordinary power series in @xmath214 .",
    "one can then compare this result to that obtained by evaluation of the first- through 4th - order perturbation results , including those of eqns .",

    "<S> we provide approximate expressions for the energy eigenvalues in both the small and large quantum number limits , up to 4th order in perturbation theory , comparing these to existing handbook expansions for the characteristic values of the related mathieu equation , obtained by other methods . </S>",
