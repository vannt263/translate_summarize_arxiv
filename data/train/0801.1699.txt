    "currently , qds of diverse geometries are considered as promising candidates for implementation of quantum computation devices because the electronic , magnetic and optical properties can be controlled through the modern grown and nanofabrication techniques . due to the long electron spin dephasing time",
    "experimentally reported  @xcite , the spin of an electron localized in a qd has been suggested to realize a quantum bit . while for bulk and for 2d systems the spin relaxation processes have been studied in some detail , the problem for qd s still require deeper and further discussions .",
    "several processes that can induce spin relaxation in semiconductors have been identified and were studied . at the moment remains in discussion which , between these processes , is dominant in zero - dimensional systems .",
    "some experimental results have shown good agreement with the theoretical predictions for 2d systems  @xcite but , in general , the identification of the processes through direct comparison with the experimental results may become a formidable task .",
    "this problem is more critical for qds , since few experimental results exist and the theoretical discussion of the spin relaxation mechanisms is still an open subject .",
    "extensive theoretical works in qd systems have studied the main phonon mediated spin - flip mechanisms , including admixture processes due to spin - orbit coupling  @xcite and phonon coupling due to interface motion ( ripple mechanism )  @xcite .",
