    "in nuclear physics pions occupy a special place .",
    "being the lightest meson in its family , pions play the major role in strong interaction . in fact , pions were the first mesons predicted by yukawa as the mediator of the strong nuclear force .",
    "however , despite intensive investigations for decades , our understanding of the pion structure is far from complete .",
    "this is reflected , e.g. , by the incomplete available data base of the pion electromagnetic form factor @xmath2 in a considerably wide range of virtual photon momentum transfer @xmath1 .",
    "we understand that @xmath3 is nothing but a fourier transformation of the charge distribution .    at very small @xmath1",
    "the behavior of @xmath3 has been accurately determined by scattering of high energy pions from atomic electrons@xcite . at higher @xmath1 values",
    "one should consult pion electroproduction off a nucleon .    with the continuous and excellent electron beams available at modern accelerators , such as cebaf at jlab",
    ", it is now possible to measure pion electroproduction observables with unprecedented accuracy , at certain kinematics inaccessible with previous technology .",
    "this allows for a precise extraction of the longitudinal differential cross section via a rosenbluth separation , at very small values of mandelstam variable @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "these recent data show that the cross section @xmath5 at this kinematics exhibit a steep decreasing function of @xmath4 , indicating the dominance of the @xmath0-channel contribution in the process .",
    "this behavior becomes the first pillar for the @xmath3 extraction in refs.@xcite .",
    "the extracted @xmath3 values within the range of @xmath6 gev@xmath7 are impressively accurate .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to note that these extractions :    * rely heavily on the @xmath0-channel dominant assumption , although the assumption has never been directly checked . * are model dependent . in refs.@xcite the regge model of ref.@xcite has been utilized to obtain @xmath3 . *",
    "are plagued with the model uncertainties , which come from the extrapolation of the form factor cut - off to the physical limit .",
    "these uncertainties have been reported by ref.@xcite . *",
    "are `` strategy '' dependent . as shown in ref.@xcite , by using the same data and model as in ref.@xcite but focusing the analysis on the minimal @xmath0 allowed by kinematics , where the unwanted background is assumed to be negligible , smaller @xmath3 values",
    "are obtained .",
    "the above facts indicate that current extraction methods are far from established .",
    "since a completely model - independent extraction is quite difficult and challenging ( although it is not impossible , see ref.@xcite for instance ) , attempts in this direction would be invaluable for helping to resolve this issue .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to revisit a simple method ,  la chew - low , which is based only on the first assumption .",
    "this will also serve as an alternative method , which is obviously easy to check .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ formalism ]",
    "we briefly describe the formalism used in our calculation .",
    "section  [ @xmath1_independent_analysis ] presents the result of the @xmath1-independent analysis , where we extract the electromagnetic form factor for fixed @xmath1 values .",
    "section  [ @xmath1_dependent_analysis ] demonstrates the result of the @xmath1-dependent analysis , i.e. , the result when we parameterize the form factor with a monopole form and fit all available data simultaneously .",
    "we shall summarize and conclude our findings in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "we begin with the convention of four - momenta given in the process @xmath8 to write the @xmath0-channel amplitude for the diagram shown in fig .  [",

    "( [ eq : a51 ] ) we have added the so - called the fubini - nambu - wataghin term@xcite in order to retain the gauge invariance@xcite .",

    "energy , @xmath18 is the pion scattering angle , and @xmath19 with @xmath20 denotes the nucleon mass and @xmath21 is given by the term inside the square bracket in the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ eq : a51 ] ) . inserting eq .",
    "( [ eq : f5andf6 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : dcsl ] ) and by making use of @xmath22 we obtain @xmath23 since we are working with small @xmath0 , we can neglect both @xmath0 and @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mandelstam - t ] ) to obtain @xmath24 , so that the last term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dsl / dt ] ) can be reduced to @xmath25 .",
    "this has an advantage , because we have reduced the dependencies of the cross section on @xmath0 .",
    "finally , we can shift the pion propagator term to the l.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dsl / dt ] ) and using @xmath26 to obtain @xmath27 the r.h.s . of eq .",

    "( [ eq : dsl / dt*(t - m2 ) ] ) to the pion pole ( @xmath28 ) could be directly performed to determine the @xmath3 at a certain @xmath1 value , because the r.h.s .",
    "is free of poles and the extrapolation ( setting @xmath0 at @xmath29 ) will eliminate other contributions beyond the @xmath0-channel one .",
    "however , as we clearly understand , this is not the case .    to overcome the shortcoming of the extrapolation method , here",
    "we only assume that eq .",
    "( [ eq : dsl / dt*(t - m2 ) ] ) is valid in the physical region ( @xmath30 , but still small ) because the @xmath0-channel dominates the process .",
    "thus , for each value of @xmath1 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : dsl / dt*(t - m2 ) ] ) can be fitted to the data in the form of @xmath31 to obtain @xmath3 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fit_function ] ) we introduce the @xmath32 parameter to account for other terms neglected in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dsl / dt*(t - m2 ) ] ) .",
    "obviously , the use of this parameter improves the @xmath33 significantly , thus , absorbing more information from the electroproduction data , but at the cost of increasing the flexibility of the fit , i.e. , increasing the error bars of the extracted @xmath3 .",
    "in this analysis we first fix the value of the pion - nucleon coupling constant to be @xmath34@xcite .",
    "we note that in the literature this value varies from 13.45@xcite to 14.52@xcite .",
    "thus , our choice lies nicely in this range .",
    "later , we will also try to investigate the influence of the coupling constant variation on the extracted form factor . for the hadronic vertex",
    "we adopt the monopole form factor @xmath35 reference@xcite has pointed out that @xmath36 gev is generally used , whereas the precise value of @xmath37 is a matter of controversy and may vary between 0.4 and 1.5 gev .",
    "meson exchange models for nucleon - nucleon interaction dictates that @xmath38 gev@xcite , whereas lattice qcd calculations prefer a value of 0.75 gev@xcite . on the other hand qcd sum rule calculations yield @xmath39 gev @xcite , while k. vansyoc@xcite found that @xmath40 gev is demanded by the present pion electroproduction data .    in this work we found that the best result is obtained by using @xmath41 gev , i.e. , the case when we consider the result of meson exchange models for the nucleon - nucleon interactions@xcite",
    "nevertheless , using the generally accepted value ( i.e. @xmath42 gev ) the obtained result is still in good agreement with previous analyses .    at @xmath43 gev",
    "there are four sets of data points from ref.@xcite with @xmath44 , 0.75 , 1.00 and 1.60 gev@xmath7 , as a function of @xmath0 . at higher energy and momentum transfers ( @xmath45 gev , @xmath46 and 2.45 gev@xmath7 )",

    "the error bars obtained in the present work would seem to be much larger than those of previous works .",
    "however , this is in general not true .",
    "for example , consider the case of @xmath44 gev@xmath7 . by combining the error bar obtained in ref.@xcite with the reported error bar coming from the `` model uncertainty '' we",
    "can clearly see that the error bar of the present work is indeed smaller . for other cases",
    "the error bars of the present work are mostly comparable to those of previous analysis . only at @xmath71 gev@xmath7",
    "the obtained error bar is much larger .",
    "the reason behind this behavior is obvious from fig .",
    "[ fig:(t - mu2)dsig_dt ] .",
    "comparing with the result of ref.@xcite at the same kinematics we can conclude that this error bar can be significantly reduced if more statistics are available at this point .",
    "the two data points at 1.6 and 2.45 gev@xmath7 from ref.@xcite require a special explanation .",
    "first , ref.@xcite does not report the `` model uncertainties '' which appear during the extraction process . from table  [",
    "tab : numeical_f_pi ] we can see that these uncertainties are substantial in increasing the error bars@xcite .",
    "second , the discrepancy appears between our result and those of ref.@xcite for these two data points are presumably due to higher @xmath17 and @xmath0 , where other terms excluded in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dsl / dt*(t - m2 ) ] ) could start to contribute .",
    "nevertheless , the error bars for the two @xmath3 at @xmath46 gev@xmath7 of our results indicate that our analysis in this case is still consistent .",
    "therefore , we believe that the error - bars obtained in the present work are realistic , especially if we compare them with those obtained from scattering of high energy pions from atomic electrons at @xmath72 gev@xmath7@xcite . thus , more statistics in the longitudinal cross section data will reduce these values .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : had_var ] we demonstrate the variation of the extracted electromagnetic form factor @xmath3 due to the variation of the hadronic cut - off ( @xmath42 gev and 1.30 gev ) .",
    "the corresponding numerical values for the two cases are listed in table  [ tab : numeical_f_pi ] .",
    "a soft cut - off will substantially suppress the cross section . to overcome this suppression the fit will increase the electromagnetic form factor cut - off . this explains why the extracted @xmath3 values increase once we decrease the hadronic cut - off . from this figure",
    "we may conclude that the best agreement with the results of refs.@xcite is obtained if we set the hadronic cut - off to @xmath73 gev , a case when we consider the result of meson exchange models for the nucleon - nucleon interactions@xcite .",
    "note that in figs .",
    "[ fig : pion_ff ] and [ fig : had_var ] we compare our results with the monopole form factor obtained by using the particle data group ( pdg ) value@xcite of the pion charge radius , i.e. 0.672 fm . in the literature one can find that the value ranges from 0.560 fm  @xcite to 0.740 fm  @xcite , whereas the recent chiral perturbation theory extraction yields a value of 0.661 fm  @xcite .",
    "in the previous section we have extracted the electromagnetic pion form factors at fixed @xmath1 values .",
    "it is however possible to analyze the whole experimental data simultaneously in a fit . for this purpose",
    ", we have to assume that the electromagnetic form factor can be parametrized with a monopole form factor , @xmath74 a quick glance to fig .",
    "[ fig : had_var ] indicates that with this monopole parameterization it would be difficult to produce the pion charge radius as reported by pdg , especially if we used @xmath42 gev , for which we see that the two extracted form factors at @xmath46 gev@xmath7 and 2.45 gev@xmath7 obviously overestimate the monopole parameterization . for @xmath41 gev",
    "we could expect that such a parameterization would still fairly work , since as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : had_var ] the pdg form factor is still within the corresponding error bars .",
    "nevertheless , a simultaneous fit to all available experimental data is quite important if we want to investigate the internal consistency of the data or the general trend of the extracted parameters .",
    "furthermore , within this framework we can leave the fit to determine not only the electromagnetic form factors @xmath3 , but also the hadronic cut - off @xmath37 and the pion - nucleon coupling constant @xmath13 . here",
    ", it is important to note that compared to the conventional approaches , which make use of thousands data points , a simultaneous fit to only 36 data points is clearly less reliable to accurately determine the hadronic cut - off and coupling constant of the pion .",
    "therefore , our motivation here is only to confirm the results obtained by the @xmath1-independent analysis given in the previous section as well as to check our claim about the limitation of our model .",

    "the corresponding numerical values extracted from this fit along with their @xmath49 are shown in the second column of table  [ tab : fit_par ] .",
    "the individual @xmath33 as a function of @xmath0 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi1 ] .",
    "fitting to all available data results in a total @xmath33 of about 36 .",
    "interestingly , we found that more than 36% of it come from the reanalyzed desy data at @xmath47 gev , @xmath48 gev@xmath7@xcite .",
    "this indicates that these data are probably incompatible with the recent jlab data @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we found that these data belong also to the high-@xmath0 and @xmath17 data .",
    "the more surprising result is however shown by the set of the new jlab data at @xmath91 gev@xmath7@xcite .",
    "although this data set contains five precise data points , the combination of high @xmath0 , @xmath17 , and @xmath1 , obviously puts these data beyond the limitation of our approach . for @xmath92 gev@xmath7 only the data point at @xmath93 gev@xmath7 yields @xmath94 .",
    "this is understandable if we look at the first panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:(t - mu2)dsig_dt ] , where it is obvious that this data point slightly underestimates the trend of the other data .",
    "the same situation happens for the last data point at @xmath95 gev@xmath7 .",
    "finally , we found that the first two data points at @xmath96 gev@xmath7 and @xmath71 gev@xmath7 overestimate the fit result .",
    "this fact is relatively difficult to explain , especially for the first case , for which the corresponding @xmath0 are clearly small .",
    "probably , these data points are too high or other physics beyond our approach at this kinematics are missing .    as a second step",
    "we remove the data points that produce @xmath97 from our fitting data base .",
    "the number of data points at this step turns out to be 19 .",
    "the extracted parameters obtained from fitting to these data are shown in the third column of table  [ tab : fit_par ] .",
    "obviously the @xmath49 decreases significantly .",
    "the pion charge radius and hadronic cut - off increase slightly from those of the first fit , whereas the pion coupling stays the same .",
    "the only interesting result at this step is the fact that the highest @xmath33 comes from the data point at @xmath45 gev , @xmath71 , @xmath98 gev@xmath7 .",
    "again , this is understandable because of the combination of high @xmath0 and @xmath17 and , furthermore , this data point seems to underestimate the trend of other four data points .    as the last step",
    "we remove the data point at @xmath45 gev , @xmath71 , @xmath98 gev@xmath7 from our fitting data base and refit the rest of the data ( 18 points ) .",
    "the extracted parameters for this step are shown in the fourth column of table  [ tab : fit_par ] .",
    "the value of @xmath49 is very small , indicating that our approach works pretty well for these selected data .",
    "the pion charge radius ( as well as its error bar ) and the hadronic cut - off increase significantly after we have removed the last data point as described above .",
    "although having a relatively large error bar , the pion charge radius is now much closer to the pdg value compared to those obtained in the first and second steps .",
    "thus , the result of the third step corroborates the finding in the @xmath1-independent analysis , i.e. , smaller @xmath33 values would be obtained if we used @xmath41 gev .",
    "another way to understand this result is by comparing the electromagnetic form factors @xmath3 obtained from this analysis with that of the pdg and those obtained from the @xmath1-independent analysis described in the previous section .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : monopole_fit ] , where we can clearly see that omitting the high-@xmath33 data ( put in other words , using experimental data with the kinematics allowed by the model ) results in a form factor that is in closer agreement with the form factor of pdg and those obtained from the @xmath1-independent analysis with @xmath41 gev .",
    "it is also important to note that the values of @xmath32 and pion coupling constant are relatively stable for the three different fits ( see table  [ tab : fit_par ] ) .",
    "the relatively large error bars for the latter indicate that our conclusion drawn from the two analyses is not too sensitive to the variation of the @xmath13 within the fit limit .",
    "in conclusion , we would like to say that we are able to extract the electromagnetic form factor of pion from the recent longitudinal cross section data of pion electroproduction from jlab by using a simple @xmath0-channel diagram , which utilizes fewer assumptions compared to the previous calculations . for this purpose",
    "we have performed a @xmath1-independent analysis supplemented with a @xmath1-dependent analysis .",
    "the result of the first analysis shows a good agreement with @xmath3 extracted from previous works .",
    "the extracted values depend on the choice of the hadronic form factor cut - off .",
    "nevertheless , by using the generally accepted value we still obtain a satisfactory result .",
    "the best result would be obtained if we used a cut - off from the meson exchange model .",
    "the result of the second analysis corroborates the findings of the first one .",
    "more accurate , with also smaller @xmath99 , longitudinal cross section data will certainly help to reduce the uncertainty of the present calculation .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that this simple calculation provides for the first time a direct proof that at the given kinematics pion electroproduction is dominated by the @xmath0-channel process .",
    "previous works considered this merely as an assumption .",
    "this result could set a new constraint on the phenomenological models that try to explain the process , i.e. at the kinematics given in this paper contributions from other channels should vanish or a least should be minimal .",
    "we note that , however , at small @xmath0 but higher energies , contributions of certain resonances to the process could be substantial .",

    "<S> the result of the first analysis is in good agreement with those of previous works and fit the maris and tandy model as well as the monopole parameterization which describes a pion radius of 0.672 fm . </S>",
    "<S> the result of the second analysis corroborates the findings in the first analysis . </S>",
    "<S> our findings therefore provide a direct proof that at the given kinematics the @xmath0-channel diagram really dominates the process . </S>",
