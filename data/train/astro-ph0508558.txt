    "( 2004 ) and found that the bright end luminosity functions agree extremely well at all redshifts .",

    "( 2005 ) used the croom et al .",

    "we consider in our analysis two restricted , uniform , flux - limited x - ray samples .",
    "the most important consideration in choosing our soft x - ray flux limits was that there be no significant x - ray incompleteness . in figure",
    "[ fig1 ] , we show @xmath28  kev flux versus off - axis radius for the full 2  ms cdf - n x - ray sample of alexander et al .",

    "we use small squares to denote sources that are detected in the 2  ms survey but not in the 1  ms survey ( brandt et al .",
    "for the bright subsample , we consider sources in a @xmath35 radius region with fluxes above @xmath36  ergs  @xmath27  s@xmath6 ( @xmath28  kev ) , and for the deep subsample , we consider sources in an @xmath37 radius region with fluxes above @xmath38  ergs  @xmath27  s@xmath6 ( @xmath28  kev ) .",
    "we show these flux and radius limits with solid lines .",
    "the two subsamples comprise 160 sources , 8 of which are stars .",
    "we can see from figure  [ fig1 ] that the flux limits of our subsamples are well above the flux limit of the 2  ms survey ( _ dotted curve _ ) at all radii , suggesting that there should be very little x - ray incompleteness in our sample .",
    "indeed , when we consider the 160 sources in the 2  ms exposure that lie within our two subsamples , we find that only five sources were not already detected in the 1  ms exposure .",
    "if we were using the 1  ms catalog in our analysis rather than the 2  ms catalog , then this would correspond to a 3% incompleteness . with the 2  ms exposure",
    ", we expect x - ray incompleteness to be negligible .",
    "having selected a highly complete x - ray sample , our next concern was that we sample the full luminosity ranges of interest without clipping out any sources .",
    "for the traditional intermediate and high x - ray luminosity cut - offs of @xmath39 and @xmath40  ergs  s@xmath6 , this very naturally sets the redshift interval to @xmath2 .",
    "we can see this from figure  [ fig2 ] , where we show rest - frame @xmath3  kev luminosity versus redshift for the cdf - n x - ray sources in our ( a ) bright and ( b ) faint subsamples .",
    "we determined the rest - frame @xmath3  kev luminosities from the observed - frame @xmath28  kev fluxes , assuming an intrinsic @xmath41 spectrum . at @xmath42 ,",
    "observed - frame @xmath28  kev corresponds to rest - frame @xmath3  kev , providing the best possible match to lower redshift data .",
    "moreover , the @xmath28  kev _ chandra _ images are deeper than the @xmath3  kev images , so using the observed - frame soft x - ray fluxes at high redshifts results in increased sensitivity .",
    "we only show the luminosities at low redshifts for illustrative purposes , since normally one would use the observed - frame @xmath3  kev fluxes to calculate the @xmath3  kev luminosities at these redshifts .",
    "the soft x - ray flux limits of our faint and bright subsamples _ ( solid curves ) _ correspond to rest - frame @xmath3  kev luminosities of @xmath43  ergs  s@xmath6 and @xmath40  ergs  s@xmath6 , respectively , at @xmath42 .",
    "thus , we will not be clipping out any sources in either the @xmath39 to @xmath40  ergs  s@xmath6 interval in the faint subsample , or the @xmath44 to @xmath45  ergs  s@xmath6 interval in the bright subsample , if we choose @xmath2 for our analysis .",
    "once we have chosen our soft x - ray flux and radius limits and our redshift interval , we can plot the spectroscopically identified @xmath2 sources in the flux - radius plane and see how many lie in our restricted subsamples .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] , where we denote with large squares the sources that have been spectroscopically identified to lie in the redshift interval @xmath2 .",
    "the soft x - ray flux and radius limits for our two subsamples were chosen without regard to this distribution , as can be seen from the figure .",
    "there are 15 sources in our two subsamples with spectroscopic redshifts in the interval @xmath2 .",
    "another issue we need to address is how many of the x - ray sources with detected optical / near - infrared ( nir ) counterparts we may be misidentifying . of the 160 sources in the 2  ms exposure that lie within our two subsamples , 138 are detected above the @xmath46 limit of 23 in @xmath1 .",
    "thus , only 22 of the sources in our subsamples are not detected at the @xmath46 level in the nir . by randomizing the source positions and remeasuring the @xmath1 band magnitudes many times , we found an 11% probability of misidentification .",
    "thus , of the 138 sources in our subsamples with @xmath46 @xmath1 band detections , we would expect that about 15 might be contaminated by the projection of random , superposed objects .    of the 22 sources that are not detected at the @xmath46 level in @xmath1 ,",
    "11 are detected in the irac @xmath47 m band at @xmath48 magnitude , with a 4% probability of misidentification based on randomized measurements .",
    "this corresponds to about one - half of a source .",
    "of the remaining 11 sources that are not detected at @xmath47 m , 5 are detected at @xmath49 , with a 10% probability of misidentification based on randomized measurements .",
    "again , this corresponds to about one - half of a source .",
    "thus , in total , we have optical / nir identifications for 154 of the 160 sources , eight of which are stars , and we expect about 16 ( or just over 10% ) of these to be false . even if a large fraction of the 16 real sources suffering from random projections were in the @xmath2 range , which is not very likely , the correction to the number densities we derive subsequently would be small .",
    "barger et al .  ( 2002 , 2003b ) computed photometric redshifts for the cdf - n x - ray sources using broadband galaxy colors and the bayesian code of bentez ( 2000 ) .",
    "they only used sources with probabilities for the photometric redshift of greater than 90% , resulting in about an 85% success rate for photometric identifications .",
    "these redshifts are robust and surprisingly accurate ( often to better than 8% when compared with the spectroscopic redshifts ) for non  broad - line agns .",
    "we now have the advantage of the _ spitzer _ irac @xmath47 m , @xmath50 m , @xmath51 m , and @xmath52 m data , as well as the nir @xmath0 and @xmath1 band data , for estimating photometric redshifts .",
    "barger et al .",
    "( 2005 ) classified the x - ray sources into four spectral classes : absorbers ( i.e. , no strong emission lines [ ew([oii])@xmath53    or ew(h@xmath54nii)@xmath55   ] ) , star formers ( i.e. , strong balmer lines and no broad or high - ionization lines ) , high - excitation ( hex ) sources ( i.e. , [ nev ] or civ lines or strong [ oiii ] [ ew([oiii ]  5007  @xmath56  ew(h@xmath57 ) , and broad - line agns ( i.e. , optical lines having fwhm line widths greater than 2000  km  s@xmath6 ) .",
    "the measured spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the x - ray sources in each of these spectral classes turn out to be remarkably tight .",
    "thus , we can construct templates from the average seds for each class and obtain an _ ir photometric redshift _ by fitting the templates to the optical through mid - infrared ( mir ) data .",
    "we note that the template fitting is insensitive to the spectral class for sources without strong agn signatures .    in figure  [ fig3 ] , we compare both ( a ) the optical photometric redshifts from barger et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , and ( b ) our new ir photometric redshifts with the spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "both photometric redshift techniques tend to fail on some of the broad - line agns _ ( large open squares ) _ , but , fortunately , broad - line agns are straightforward to identify spectroscopically , even in the so - called redshift `` desert '' at @xmath58 , and nearly all of the cdf - n x - ray sources have now been spectroscopically observed . while the bayesian optical photometric redshift technique gives slightly tighter values at low redshifts due to the presence of strong spectral features and breaks in the templates from coleman , wu , & weedman ( 1988 ) and kinney et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , it does not do so well on the @xmath59 sources . in our subsequent analysis",

    "[ fig4 ] , we show histograms of the spectroscopic _ ( light shading ) _ and ir photometric _ ( dark shading ) _ redshift identifications versus @xmath60 magnitude for the sources in our ( a ) bright and ( b ) faint subsamples .    the photometric redshifts not only tell us which of the spectroscopically unidentified sources are likely to have redshifts within the @xmath2 redshift interval , but they also enable us to remove contaminants that are really at lower redshifts . in figure  [ fig5 ] , we show four example measured x - ray source seds _ ( solid squares ) _ redshifted to the rest - frame using the printed spectroscopic or ir photometric redshift . we have superimposed on each sed the average spectral template chosen by the ir photometric redshift fitting for that source .",
    "we selected these four examples to illustrate ( a , b ) two spectroscopically identified sources with different spectral classes ( also printed ) , both of which are in the redshift interval @xmath2 , ( c ) one ir photometric redshift of a lower redshift source , and ( d ) one ir photometric redshift of a source in the redshift interval @xmath2 .    of the 44 sources with @xmath61  ergs  @xmath27  s@xmath6 within a @xmath35 radius , 38 have spectroscopic redshifts .",

    "six of the eight sources without spectroscopic or photometric redshifts could , if they were assigned redshifts at the center of the redshift interval @xmath2 , have luminosities that would place them into one of our two luminosity intervals ( one in the high - luminosity interval , and five in the intermediate - luminosity interval ) . in figure  [ fig2 ] , we denote the x - ray sources with spectroscopic redshifts by small , solid diamonds , and the broad - line agns by large , solid diamonds .",

    "the cosmological time available at high redshifts is much shorter than that at low redshifts , and the integral of the energy density production rate over the cosmic time from @xmath71 to larger @xmath81 would still be dominated by the sources around @xmath16 for the case of a number density which rises to @xmath16 and is constant at higher redshifts .",

    "n05 argued that this incompleteness should be accounted for in their effective volume calculation ( they only expect to pick up about 40% of the objects at @xmath72 compared to a top hat function ) , but given that this is such a large correction , the uncertainties on the optical lbg selection function for agns are a concern .",
    "direct selection of x - ray sources avoids this problem and should be much more robust .",
    "second , n05 argued that they can apply a lower x - ray detection threshold for their subsample of lbgs than can be applied when constructing a purely x - ray based catalog , thereby making their x - ray detections more complete .",
    "they declared this to be critical , since they are dealing with a population of sources which are close to the detection limit .",
    "however , since none of their additional five x - ray detected lbgs in the cdf - n ( over and above the four lbgs detected in the cdf - n 2  ms catalog by alexander et al .",
    "2003 and discussed in nandra et al .",
    "2002 ) have luminosities @xmath83  ergs  s@xmath6 , this is not relevant to the issue of determining whether there is a decline in the @xmath73  ergs  s@xmath6 range .    finally , n05 stated that their lbg color selection mostly avoids any concerns about spectroscopic incompleteness , since the probability that the non - spectroscopically identified lbgs are @xmath84 galaxies is about 96% .",
    "the high spectroscopic and photometric completeness of our @xmath2 x - ray sample mitigates this issue for our current analysis .",
    "probably the most important concern about the n05 methodology is that they must correct for two window functions ( a very incomplete optical lbg selection function that is not well understood for agns , and an x - ray selection function ) rather than one . in order to determine whether their optical lbg selection function is the same for galaxies with substantial agn contributions as it is for those without",
    ", they would need to spectroscopically identify a complete x - ray sample .",
    "however , once they had undertaken such a spectroscopic survey to calibrate their optical lbg selection , then there would be no need for them to redo the agn number densities using the lbg method .",
    "in summary , we constructed two uniform , x - ray flux - limited , highly spectroscopically complete subsamples of 160 sources ( eight of which are stars ) with negligible x - ray incompleteness from the cdf - n 2  ms x - ray data to compute agn number densities in the @xmath2 redshift interval for both high ( @xmath70 ) and intermediate ( @xmath66 ) rest - frame @xmath3  kev luminosity intervals .",
    "of the 152 non - stellar sources , 102 are spectroscopically identified . in this paper , we used new uh  2.2 m ulbcam @xmath0 and @xmath1 band imaging and _ spitzer _ irac imaging to estimate ir photometric redshifts for the sources without spectroscopic redshifts , increasing our identified non - stellar sample to 144 .",
    "our final galaxy subsamples contain no more than eight unidentified sources .",
    "we then calculated the @xmath2 agn number densities ( for all spectral types together and for broad - line agns alone ) for both luminosity intervals and compared them with those at @xmath64 , which we calculated from the spectroscopic sample of barger et al .",
    "we find clear evidence for a decrease in the @xmath66 agn number densities at @xmath7 and can reject the hypothesis that the number densities remain flat to @xmath2 at above the @xmath9 level .",
