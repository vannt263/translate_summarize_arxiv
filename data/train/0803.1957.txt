    "cobalt compounds are of particular interest due to the possibility that co ions can exhibit different spin states and hence the occurrence of temperature - driven spin - state transitions .",
    "the most prominent example is lacoo@xmath1 , which has been intensively studied and controversially debated for more than fifty years , see e.g.@xcite .",
    "the co@xmath4 ions in lacoo@xmath1  feature a @xmath5 configuration which in principle can occur in three different spin states : a nonmagnetic low - spin ( ls ) ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) , an intermediate - spin ( is ) ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) and a high - spin ( hs ) state ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) .",
    "it is generally agreed that the co@xmath4  ions in lacoo@xmath1  realize the ls state at low temperatures . above",
    "approximately 25k a higher spin state , either is or hs , becomes thermally populated affecting various physical properties , e.g.  the magnetic susceptibility @xmath12 or the thermal expansion @xmath13 , which both exhibit pronounced maxima in their temperature dependencies @xcite . the susceptibility is obviously affected because the excited spin state , either is or hs , induces a strong increase of the magnetization above 25k .",
    "the thermal expansion is affected due to the different ionic radii of the smaller ls - co@xmath4  with empty and the larger is- or hs - co@xmath4  ions with partially filled @xmath14 orbitals .",
    "the spin - state transition can be well described in a ls  is scenario , i.e.  the excited spin state is the is state , with a constant energy gap of @xmath15k @xcite .",
    "however , more recent investigations show , that a ls / hs model including spin - orbit coupling is more reasonable @xcite .",
    "a consequence of the latter model is a temperature - dependent energy gap @xmath16(t ) , which strongly increases with increasing temperature @xcite .",
    "the spin - state transition in lacoo@xmath1  is strongly affected by both , heterovalent and isovalent doping on the la site .",
    "the former possibility causes hole doping and chemical pressure and suppresses the spin - state transition due to the implementation of co@xmath17 ions @xcite . the latter one , i.e.  chemical pressure without changing the co valence , is usually realized by introducing trivalent rare - earth ions @xmath18 . in @xmath0coo@xmath1",
    "the spin - state transition is not suppressed but its onset is shifted to higher temperature .",
    "the energy gap between the ls and the excited spin state increases from about @xmath15k for @xmath2  la to @xmath19k for @xmath2  eu @xcite .",
    "moreover , due to the decreasing ionic radius of the lanthanide series , the structure changes from rhombohedral in lacoo@xmath1  to orthorhombic for @xmath20 , nd and eu . recently , it has been reported , that the low - temperature thermal conductivity of lacoo@xmath1  is also very anomalous @xcite .",
    "this behaviour has been qualitatively attributed to the onset of the spin - state transition . however , a quantitative analysis of the anomalous thermal conductivity of lacoo@xmath1  has not been presented yet .",
    "the aim of this paper is to develop a consistent picture of the influence of the spin - state transition on the thermal conductivity .",
    "therefore , we measured the thermal conductivity @xmath21 of the series @xmath0coo@xmath1  with @xmath2  la , pr , nd and eu .",
    "moreover , we studied the thermal expansion @xmath22 , which is a very sensitive probe to investigate spin - state and also crystal - field transitions and their coupling to the lattice . in the quantitative analysis of our data",
    ", we will consider both models of the spin - state transition , which are favoured for lacoo@xmath1 in the literature , i.e.  we will consider the ls  is scenario with a constant @xmath16  and the more recently proposed spin - orbit coupled hs ( sochs ) model with a temperature dependent energy gap @xmath23 .",

    "the low - temperature results of lacoo@xmath1  and eucoo@xmath1  were already discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the thermal expansion consists of a phononic part and a schottky contribution , caused by the thermal population of the @xmath45 orbitals of the co@xmath4 ions , i.e.  @xmath46 .",
    "the latter contribution causes the large maximum at @xmath47k in lacoo@xmath1 . to further analyze the data we subtract @xmath48 , which we estimate using a debye function with the debye temperature @xmath49k of lacoo@xmath1  @xcite",
    "here , we used the same @xmath50 for the various cobaltates , but sample - dependent prefactors determined by scaling the debye function to the low - temperature data of each compound .",
    "as an example , we show @xmath48 for ndcoo@xmath1  in ( a ) ; @xmath48 of eucoo@xmath1  ( prcoo@xmath1 ; not shown ) is slightly larger ( smaller ) . since",
    "a clear separation of @xmath48 and @xmath51 is not possible for the low - temperature data of lacoo@xmath1 , we used @xmath48 of eucoo@xmath1also for lacoo@xmath1 .",
    "the resulting @xmath51 of all crystals are shown in ( b ) .",
    "we note that , in particular for prcoo@xmath1  and ndcoo@xmath1  the spin - state transition is seen much better in the thermal - expansion data than in the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "the reason is that @xmath48 is rather small compared to the total thermal expansion , whereas @xmath12 is dominated by the large contribution of the @xmath3 moments of the pr@xmath4 and nd@xmath4 ions , respectively , which makes a further analysis rather uncertain .",
    "the insulator - metal transitions occurring above about 500k , see e.g.  @xcite also cause anomalies in @xmath22 .",

    "moreover , @xmath25 is related to the uniaxial pressure dependence of @xmath57 via @xmath58 , where @xmath59  is boltzmann s constant , @xmath60@xmath61 the volume per formula unit and @xmath62 means uniaxial pressure along the direction of which @xmath13 is measured @xcite . to get the hydrostatic pressure dependence one has to use the volume expansion which in the case of the twinned @xmath0coo@xmath1  single crystals is given by @xmath63",
    ". the corresponding fit of @xmath13 of lacoo@xmath1  ( already presented in @xcite ) is shown by the solid line in ( b ) .",
    "the fit parameters are @xmath15k and @xmath64 giving a hydrostatic pressure dependence @xmath65 , in agreement with the increase of @xmath16  of @xmath66% obtained from measurements of @xmath12 under @xmath67gpa @xcite",
    ".    for the sochs model one has to consider the temperature dependence of @xmath16  @xcite , which can be calculated from the measured @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "for lacoo@xmath1 , this yields a linear increase @xmath69 with @xmath70k and @xmath71 in the temperature range almost up to the mi transition . using this @xmath72 in the partition sum , equation([schott ] ) modifies to @xmath73 the corresponding fit of @xmath51 with @xmath74 as the only free parameter gives the dashed line in ( b ) .",
    "obviously , both fits hardly differ because the modified @xmath75 is compensated by a larger value of @xmath76 .",
    "we note , however , that this does _ not _ necessarily correspond to a larger pressure dependence of @xmath77 , because @xmath51 of equation([schott2 ] ) is determined by the pressure dependencies of @xmath77 and that of the slope @xmath78 ; see e.g.the discussions in @xcite . in view of the small differences between both fits for lacoo@xmath1 , and since there are no indications for a temperature - dependent @xmath16from other physical quantities , the fits of @xmath51 of the other @xmath0coo@xmath1  crystals have been done for constant energy gaps only . since equations([schott ] ) and  ( [ schott2 ] ) are identical for @xmath79 , this analysis is not able to distinguish between both models .",

    "\\(a ) displays the thermal - conductivity data of @xmath0coo@xmath1 .",
    "as has been already found in previous studies on lacoo@xmath1@xcite , the overall shape and qualitative behaviour of @xmath21 is rather unusual .",
    "first of all , @xmath85 is rather low in the whole temperature range and its temperature dependence clearly deviates from the typical behaviour expected for a conventional phononic heat conductor .",
    "the thermal conductivity of lacoo@xmath1  exhibits a maximum around 2030k . towards higher temperatures",
    "@xmath85 rapidly drops and features a minimum around 150k instead of the expected @xmath86-decrease ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "qualitatively , this minimum can be traced back to the spin - state transition of lacoo@xmath1 , which sets in close to the maximum of @xmath85 .",
    "the thermal population of the co @xmath45 levels induces a certain fraction of co@xmath4 ions with a larger ionic radius compared to the ls co@xmath4  ions .",
    "these randomly distributed larger co@xmath4  ions do not only cause the huge anomaly in @xmath22 , but also lead to additional disorder in the lattice and therefore act as additional scattering centers for phonons .",
    "hence , the thermal conductivity is additionally suppressed .",
    "a quantitative description will be given below .",
    "since the spin - state transition shifts to higher temperature when la@xmath4 is replaced by smaller @xmath18 ions , the above scenario suggests that the onset of the suppression of @xmath21 of @xmath0coo@xmath1systematically shifts towards higher temperature with decreasing radius of the @xmath18 ion .",
    "let us first consider the data of eucoo@xmath1 , which is the compound with the smallest @xmath18 ion and the largest @xmath87k @xcite .",
    "hence , the spin - state transition should not affect the thermal conductivity below room temperature and , indeed , the thermal conductivity of eucoo@xmath1  exhibits much larger values than in lacoo@xmath1 .",
    "its low - temperature maximum exceeds that of lacoo@xmath1  by about one order of magnitude .",
    "moreover , the temperature dependence of @xmath85 of eucoo@xmath1  meets the expectation of a purely phononic heat conductor .    the thermal conductivity of ndcoo@xmath1  is lower than @xmath85 of eucoo@xmath1 in the entire temperature range and , at a first glance , its overall temperature dependence seems to be consistent with a conventional phononic picture , too . a closer inspection of the data yields , however , a slight slope change towards a somewhat steeper decrease of @xmath21 at @xmath88k , i.e.  close to the onset temperature of the spin - state transition , see ( b ) .",
    "this slope change supports the above proposed explanation that the spin - state transition causes additional scattering centers .",
    "prcoo@xmath1  also exhibits an unusual temperature dependence of @xmath85 , which appears somewhat similar to that of lacoo@xmath1 . above the low - temperature maximum",
    ", @xmath21 rapidly decreases to a small value of @xmath89w / km and remains almost temperature independent between about 80k and 175k . above this temperature a further decrease of @xmath85 sets in . since this decrease starts again at the onset of the spin - state transition ( see ( b ) ) , it is natural to attribute it to the additional scattering due to the presence of co@xmath4  ions in different spin states .",
    "in contrast , the anomalous temperature dependence of @xmath21 at lower temperature is not related to the spin - state transition and , as will be discussed separately in , this anomalous feature is related to the crystal - field splitting of the @xmath3 shell of pr@xmath4 .    summarizing the presented data",
    "so far , we observe in all crystals with @xmath90k that this onset coincides with an additional suppression of @xmath85 .",
    "since @xmath16  strongly increases with decreasing @xmath18 radius @xcite , @xmath24  also shifts towards higher temperature and the additional suppression of the thermal conductivity is less obvious , because at higher temperature the usual suppression of @xmath85 due to phonon - phonon umklapp scattering becomes more and more dominant .",
    "however , the data in ( a ) also show , that @xmath85 is not only suppressed at temperatures _ above _",
    "@xmath24 . instead , with increasing size of @xmath18 a monotonic decrease of @xmath85 in the _ entire _ temperature range is found ( here we have neglected the additional suppression of @xmath91 in prcoo@xmath1 ) .",
    "if the spin - state transition would be the only effect causing additional disorder scattering , @xmath21 should approach the bare phononic value below @xmath24 .",
    "taking eucoo@xmath1  with stable ls co@xmath4 ions up to above room temperature as a rough measure for this bare phononic heat conduction , it becomes clear that this expectation is not observed in our data .",
    "in general , the magnitude of the low - temperature maximum of @xmath85 depends on the sample quality , which determines the maximum free path .",
    "thus , the different values within the @xmath0coo@xmath1series could arise from different sample qualities . however , there is no indication for a systematic increase of the crystal quality with decreasing @xmath18 ion radius",
    ". is also influenced by twinning .",
    "all these single crystals are twinned , but it seems plausible that the average size of the twin domains increases from lacoo@xmath92 to eucoo@xmath92 , because the deviation from the cubic symmetry increases .",
    "however , the observed correlation between @xmath82 and the magnetic impurity concentration for the different lacoo@xmath92 crystals , makes it rather unlikely to explain the different low - temperature maxima of @xmath85 in terms of different domain sizes . ] in order to study a possible influence of the crystal quality , we measured @xmath85 of five different lacoo@xmath1  single crystals .",
    "as shown in ( b ) the high - temperature behaviour is essentially the same for all crystals , but the low - temperature maxima differ considerably .",
    "nevertheless , all of them remain much lower than that of eucoo@xmath1 .",
    "we relate the low - temperature maxima of @xmath85 to the defect concentrations by considering the low - temperature magnetization , since a really pure lacoo@xmath1  with all co@xmath4 ions in the ls state would be non - magnetic ( apart from core dia- and van  vleck paramagnetism ) . at @xmath93k",
    "we measured magnetization up to 14  tesla in order to reach its saturation @xmath94 , which is a measure of the content of magnetic impurities .",
    "the inset of displays the low - temperature maxima of @xmath21 vs. @xmath94 , which indeed roughly follow a @xmath95 dependence as shown by the solid line .",
    "the most likely source for magnetic impurities in lacoo@xmath1  is a weak oxygen nonstoichiometry , which changes the average valence from co@xmath4 towards co@xmath96 or co@xmath17 . due to the odd number of @xmath97 electrons , the latter are magnetic in all possible electronic configurations , but in most cases co@xmath96 and co@xmath17 realize @xmath98 and @xmath99 states with spin @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively .",
    "experimental evidence for a weak charge - carrier doping in nominally pure lacoo@xmath1  stems from the large values of different signs of the room - temperature thermopower for the different lacoo@xmath1  crystals ; cf .   and the discussion in @xcite . from magnetization data on sr - doped lacoo@xmath1it",
    "is known that low doping concentrations induce so - called high - spin polarons with effective spin values up to @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "such polarons are formed around the doping - induced co@xmath17 ions , which cause a spin - state transition in the adjacent co@xmath4 ions .",
    "most probably , this is a transition from the ls to an is state , because the electronic configuration @xmath103 of co@xmath4 is favourable for the hopping of the @xmath45 electron for both kinds of neighbours , co@xmath17 with @xmath99 and co@xmath96 with @xmath98 .",
    "other possible configurations often only allow a @xmath104 hopping or may cause the so - called spin - blockade effect @xcite .",
    "the formation of high - spin polarons will depend on @xmath16  between the ls ground state and the excited spin state of co@xmath4 . since @xmath16  strongly increases with decreasing @xmath18 radius , the occurrence of such polarons in the @xmath0coo@xmath1  series should get more and more unlikely for smaller @xmath18 ions .",
    "unfortunately , the presence of high - spin polarons in prcoo@xmath1  and ndcoo@xmath1  can not be studied by magnetization measurements because of the strong magnetism of the partially filled @xmath3 shells of pr@xmath4 and nd@xmath4 . for eucoo@xmath1  such",
    "an analysis is again easier , because eu@xmath4 only exhibits van  vleck paramagnetism and , in fact , the impurity contribution to the magnetic susceptibility in eucoo@xmath1  is one order of magnitude smaller than in lacoo@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the magnetic impurity contribution of the la@xmath105eu@xmath106coo@xmath1  series systematically decreases with increasing @xmath107 , i.e.  with decreasing average ionic size on the la site and with increasing @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "these observations strongly support the above idea that the systematic dependence of the low - temperature thermal conductivity of @xmath0coo@xmath1  on the ionic size of @xmath18 is related to phonon scattering by high - spin polarons , whose formation depend on a weak oxygen - nonstoichiometry and on @xmath16 .",
    "for a quantitative analysis of the thermal conductivity we use an extended debye model @xcite @xmath108 here , @xmath50 denotes the debye temperature , @xmath109 the sound velocity , @xmath110 the phonon frequency , @xmath111 and @xmath112 the phonon relaxation time .",
    "the scattering rates of different independent scattering mechanisms sum up to a total scattering rate @xmath113 the three terms on the right - hand side refer to the typical scattering rates for phonon heat transport in insulators , namely boundary ( @xmath114 ; @xmath115 mm is the characteristic length scale of the sample @xcite and was kept fixed for all crystals ) , point defect ( @xmath116 ) and phonon - phonon umklapp scattering ( @xmath117 ) . since",

    "as shown by the solid line in , the thermal conductivity data of eucoo@xmath1  can be reproduced reasonably well by equation([kphonon ] ) . in order to reduce the number of adjustable parameters",

    "the other parameters have been adjusted to fit the experimental data .",

    "this gives further evidence that the spin - state transition is indeed responsible for the suppression of the thermal conductivity of prcoo@xmath1  and ndcoo@xmath1  as it is the case for lacoo@xmath1 .    with fits based on equation([kphonon ] ) assuming ( a ) the ls  is or ( b ) the sochs model for the spin - state transition .",
    "the dashed ( solid ) lines are obtained when a minimum mean - free @xmath119 is ( is not ) taken into account ( see text ) . ]",
    "encouraged by this finding we tried to fit the thermal conductivity of lacoo@xmath1  via equation([kphonon ] ) including the additional scattering rate given by equations([tauexp ] ) and  ( [ equ_taudis ] ) in equation([rates ] ) .",
    "again , we restrict our analysis to @xmath143k and keep most of the fit parameters fixed to their values as obtained from the debye fit of the bare phononic @xmath85 of eucoo@xmath1 . from these parameters , we only readjust the prefactor @xmath144 of the point - defect scattering term in equation([rates ] ) , because the number of point defects varies in different crystals , and point - defect scattering also reduces @xmath85 at high temperatures .",
    "in addition , the scattering strength @xmath126 is readjusted , but changes only little ( to @xmath145s@xmath61 and @xmath146s@xmath61 for the ls / is and the sochs model , respectively ) , and we consider the minimum mean - free path @xmath119 .",
    "the results for the ls  is as well as the sochs model are displayed in .",
    "both models describe the thermal conductivity well over a large temperature range of about 200k , in particular , when the minimum mean - free path is taken into account . as was already seen in the quality of the fits based on the different models",
    "hardly differs .",
    "therefore , the analysis of the thermal conductivity of @xmath0coo@xmath1  does not allow to judge , whether the ls / is or the sochs scenario is preferable .",
    "next we consider the additional suppression of @xmath85 of prcoo@xmath1  below @xmath24 , which is not related to the spin - state transition .",
    "as can be seen in , the thermal expansion of this compound also exhibits an additional anomaly at lower temperatures .",
    "this anomaly arises from the crystal - field splitting of the @xmath3 shell of the pr@xmath4 ions . in an orthorhombic crystal field",
    "the @xmath61h@xmath147 multiplet of the free pr@xmath4 ion splits into nine singlets .",
    "we are not aware of experimental investigations of the crystal - field splitting in prcoo@xmath1 , but it is known that the crystal - field levels of other orthorhombic pr@xmath28o@xmath1 are very similar @xcite . only the lower levels slightly depend on the exact orthorhombic distortion , which is mainly characterized by the @xmath28o@xmath28 canting angle .",
    "the energy splitting between the crystal - field ground state and the first excited level in prcoo@xmath1  can be determined from a fit of the low - temperature thermal expansion by a schottky anomaly . as shown in ( a ) ,",
    "such a fit for two non - degenerate levels ( setting @xmath148 and replacing @xmath16  by @xmath149 in equation  ( [ schott ] ) ) describes the experimental data well and yields @xmath150k and @xmath151  % . for the higher - lying energy levels we use the values @xmath152k , @xmath153k , @xmath154 of prnio@xmath1 @xcite , which has almost the same @xmath28o@xmath28 canting angle as prcoo@xmath1 .",
    "we note here that the thermal population of these higher - lying levels may contribute to @xmath22 at higher temperatures , but below about 50k the two - level system used is sufficient to model the experimental data .",
    "the most likely source for the suppression of the thermal conductivity of prcoo@xmath1  in the intermediate temperature range is resonant scattering between different @xmath3 crystal - field levels , as it is also known from e.g.  rare - earth garnets @xcite .",
    "in such a resonant scattering process a phonon is absorbed by inducing a transition between different energy levels and then re - emitted in an arbitrary direction ( see e.g.@xcite ) , causing an additional thermal resistance .",
    "a mechanism based on random volume changes as discussed above for the spin - state transition of co@xmath4  is unlikely because the @xmath3 orbitals are inner shells .",
    "this difference is directly reflected in the magnitudes of the schottky peaks , which are mainly determined by the underlying volume change .",
    "the low - temperature peak in @xmath13 of prcoo@xmath1  is e.g.  one order of magnitude smaller than that of lacoo@xmath1 ; see and .",
    "due to the spin - state transition of lacoo@xmath1  by a resonant scattering process completely failed . ]    .",
    "the thermal - expansion data ( symbols ) in panel ( a ) are well described by a schottky anomaly ( line ) of a two - level system with non - degenerate levels with energy splitting @xmath155k .",
    "the lines f01 , f02 and f12 in panel ( b ) are fits for @xmath156k to the thermal conductivity data ( symbols ) including either the resonant scattering process @xmath157 , @xmath158 or @xmath159 , respectively . a sketch of the energy levels is also included @xcite . ]    in order to model @xmath21 in the low-@xmath160 range we include the rate @xmath161 in equation([rates ] ) describing a direct resonant scattering process @xcite . here , @xmath162 is the energy difference between the two levels , and @xmath163 , @xmath164 denote their population determined by the partition sum . for the fit we keep again @xmath49k and @xmath165 m/s , while @xmath144 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath0 are adjusted with respect to the data .",
    "the fits have been restricted to @xmath168k , since other processes may become dominant at very low temperatures .    in a first attempt , resonant scattering between @xmath169 and the first excited level @xmath170 is considered , yielding the fit labelled f01 in ( b ) .",
    "this fit only reproduces the data for @xmath171k but totally misses the low - temperature maximum in @xmath21 .",
    "basically the same result is achieved by considering the process @xmath158 ( curve f02 in ( b ) ) .",
    "a much better description of the data is obtained , however , for the process @xmath159 ( curve f12 ; with parameters @xmath172s@xmath61 , @xmath173s@xmath29/k , @xmath174 and @xmath175s@xmath61 ) .",
    "hence , the transition @xmath159 appears to be the dominant scattering channel of the phonons in prcoo@xmath1  at intermediate temperatures .",
    "in this paper we have presented measurements of the thermal - expansion coefficient and the thermal conductivity of @xmath0coo@xmath1 , with trivalent @xmath2  la , pr , nd and eu . as a consequence of the chemical pressure due to the decreasing ionic radius from @xmath2  la to eu , the energy gap between the ls ground state and the first excited spin state of the co@xmath4  ions increases drastically and the temperature - induced spin - state transition of the co@xmath4ions is systematically shifted towards higher temperature . this strong pressure dependence is also reflected in pronounced schottky anomalies in the thermal - expansion coefficients , making this quantity a sensitive probe to analyze spin - state transitions .",
    "the microscopic origin of the pressure dependence is the volume change due to the partial occupation of the @xmath45 levels of the co@xmath4  ions in the excited spin state in contrast to the empty @xmath45 levels of ls co@xmath4  ions .",
    "another consequence of this volume difference is a strong suppression of the phonon heat transport , which sets in above the onset temperature of the spin - state transition , because the random occupation of the co sites with co@xmath4  ions in different spin states , i.e.  of different sizes , causes additional lattice disorder . by considering this disorder as point - like defects",
    ", our analysis clearly shows this effect in the temperature dependence of the corresponding scattering rates of lacoo@xmath1 , prcoo@xmath1  and ndcoo@xmath1 , where the spin - state transition sets in below room temperature , in contrast to eucoo@xmath1  which exhibits a stable ls state up to about 400k .",
    "quantitatively , the temperature dependence of the additional scattering due to the spin - state transition can be described in a model based on the nordheim rule , which is usually applied to describe scattering in disordered mixed alloys . for the cobaltates",
    ", this means that the temperature dependence of this additional scattering rate is given by the product of the occupation numbers of the ls and of the excited spin states .",
    "moreover , we find that the scattering strength is constant for lacoo@xmath1 , prcoo@xmath1  and ndcoo@xmath1 .",
    "our analysis does , however , not allow to distinguish between the different models discussed for the spin - state transition in lacoo@xmath1 , namely a ls  is scenario with a temperature - independent energy gap or the more recently proposed model based on a spin - orbit coupled high - spin state with a temperature - dependent energy gap .",
    "the above described model explains a damping of the phonon heat transport above the onset temperature of the spin - state transition .",
    "experimentally , however , we find that as a function of increasing size of the @xmath18 ions the thermal conductivity decreases also in the temperature range below the respective onset of the spin - state transition . by studying five different lacoo@xmath1single crystals",
    ", we could show that the low - temperature thermal conductivity inversely scales with the amount of magnetic impurities .",
    "most likely , these impurities arise from a weak oxygen nonstoichiometry giving rise to a certain amount of co@xmath96 or co@xmath17 ions . since it is known that these magnetic co ions tend to form so - called high - spin polarons by inducing a spin - state transition in the neighbouring co@xmath4 ions , our data suggest that the phonon damping at low temperature arises from such a doping - induced spin - state transition .",
    "the drastic increase of the energy gap to the excited spin state of co@xmath4  for decreasing @xmath18 ionic radii makes the formation of spin polarons more and more unlikely , and thus can naturally explain the systematic increase of the thermal conductivity in the temperature range below the temperature - induced spin - state transition .",
    "additional low - temperature features have to be considered in prcoo@xmath1 , because the thermal expansion exhibits another schottky anomaly and there is an additional suppression of the thermal conductivity .",
    "both effects are not related to the temperature - dependent spin - state transition of co@xmath4 , but stem from the crystal - field splitting of the ground - state multiplet of the @xmath3 shell of pr@xmath4 .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that the schottky anomaly of the thermal expansion arises from a thermal occupation of the first excited crystal - field level , whereas the phonon damping is a consequence of resonant phonon scattering between the first two excited crystal - field levels .",
