    "for many years , the loss of angular momentum in the evolution of pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stars was a fundamental problem in the theory of star formation .",
    "as pms stars contract by a factor of @xmath023 during their first 3myrs of evolution , models assuming homologous contraction and conservation of angular momentum dictate that all stars less than @xmath01.2@xmath1 should rotate with periods shorter than @xmath02 days by an age of 2myrs @xcite .",
    "however , observations of clusters determined to be @xmath02myrs old or older show that most pms stars rotate much slower than expected .",
    "interaction between the magnetic field of a young star and the inner regions of its protoplanetary disk has been invoked by virtually every rotational evolution model as the mechanism by which the rotation periods of these stars are regulated as they evolve onto the main sequence @xcite .",
    "a first - order prediction of these models is stars interacting with their disks should have longer rotation periods than stars that have already lost their disks , leaving them free to spin up as they contract @xcite .",
    "early observations of rotation periods of pms stars , obtained by monitoring the brightness modulation produced by stellar surface features , seemed to support the star - disk interaction scenario for angular momentum regulation .",
    "some studies showed correlations between rotation period and ground - based disk indicators ( most commonly excess k - band emission , e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and interpreted these results as strong evidence for star - disk interaction , claiming that stars with longer periods were rotating more slowly because they had transferred angular momentum to their disks @xcite .",
    "this interpretation suffers from several problems as various issues can mask or mimic the correlation , such as sample size , sensitivity biases , mass effects , and , most importantly , ambiguous disk indicators .",
    "therefore , the correlation between infrared ( ir ) excess and rotation period was challenged by studies which failed to find any correlation between rotation period and a range of disk and accretion indicators in various clusters @xcite .",
    "the current work presents conclusive evidence that star - disk interaction is the mechanism by which pms angular momentum is regulated .",
    "the ability to overcome the confusion surrounding the angular momentum problem arrived with the acquisition of _ spitzer _ mid - ir observations sensitive enough to unambiguously determine the presence of a disk around pms stars in the irac band passes . in a study of the young cluster ic348 (",
    "* hereafter , paper i ) , we find that 8.0@xmath2 m data are needed to clearly identify all of the disks in a given sample of stars ( fig .",
    "5 ) ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "both the near infrared ( nir ) and irac wavelengths trace the inner rim of the disk @xcite",
    ". however , since the magnitude of the ir excess over the stellar photosphere is much larger at irac wavelengths than it is at nir wavelengths ( e.g. , 2mass wavelengths ) , irac observations , unlike ground - based studies , are sensitive enough to unambiguously determine the presence of a disk around pms stars .",
    "it might be argued that the sensitivity of the 8.0 @xmath2 m excess allows detection of both active , accreting disks and passive disks which no longer interact with their parent stars .",
    "however , the fact that the presence of an irac excess does not guarantee that the stars are _ currently _ accreting does not affect our conclusions for multiple reasons .",
    "first , disk dissipation timescales ( the time it takes for a given disk to dissipate once it has begun that process ) are much shorter than the mean accretion disk lifetimes . for instance , from the ratio of the number of weak - line t tauri stars ( wtts ) with irac excesses to the number of pms stars ( wtts plus classical t tauri stars , ctts ) , @xcite estimate the transition timescale from optically thick accretion disks to disks undetectable at irac wavelengths to be 0.4 myrs , a factor of @xmath010 smaller than typical accretion disk lifetimes .",
    "this timescale is very similar to the transition timescale between an optically thick disk and an optically thin disk found by @xcite and @xcite , based on the number of `` transition objects , '' which they define as targets without k - band excess but with strong iras excesses .",
    "thus , if an object presently shows an irac excess , it is much more likely than not to be accreting .",
    "moreover , once star - disk interaction stops , it takes some time for stars to spin up significantly .",
    "this `` reaction lag - time '' will tend to compensate for the `` detectability lag - time '' ( the time between the end of star - disk interaction and the point at which the disk is no longer detectable at irac wavelengths ) . as a result ,",
    "irac 8 @xmath2 m excess is arguably the best current method with which to reliably detect the presence of an inner circumstellar disk and study the effects of star - disk interaction on the angular momentum history of young stars .    in this paper",
    ", we present a new study of the angular momentum history of two young stellar clusters , the onc ( @xmath01 myr ) and ngc 2264 ( @xmath02 - 3 myrs ) . in  [ previous ] , we discuss results from previous work on these two clusters and ic 348 , the other well - studied pms star cluster , detailing the important factors , such as accurate disk identification and sample selection , needed to isolate the effects of circumstellar disks on the current rotation period distributions of young clusters . in  [ results ] , we describe our new results from ngc 2264 , using rotation periods from the literature and public _ spitzer _ data , and a reanalysis of the data in the onc study presented by @xcite , using the same mass sample for each study , with a stricter sample selection in the onc because of the different extinction levels in that cluster . in ",
    "[ discussion ] , we compare the two results and discuss robust monte carlo simulations , already underway , which will determine what star and disk evolution parameters are allowed given the current rotation period distributions of stars with and without a disk in each cluster .",
    "future work on the subject is also proposed .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in  [ conclusion ] .",
    "three clusters have been studied extensively to produce rotation periods from photometric monitoring campaigns , spectral types from spectroscopy and photometric colors , and disk identification from various disk indicators . until _ spitzer _",
    "mid - ir data became available , disk identification was limited to ground - based color excesses , mostly in the nir , and h@xmath3 equivalent widths .",
    "these indicators , however , have not provided disk identification accurate and reliable enough to study the effect circumstellar disks have had throughout the lives of pms stars at the age of these clusters .",
    "the correlation between rotation period and nir color excess can be masked by biases introduced by these data .",
    "for instance , it has been shown that the nir disk indicator misses 30% of the disks that can be detected at longer wavelengths @xcite .",
    "also , the ground - based photometry used to calculate the excess most often comes from different epochs , which can affect the results due to the high photometric variability of these stars @xcite .    moreover , correlations between rotation period and nir excess can be caused by a secondary effect of the correlation between mass and rotation period , in a sense mimicking the result expected from star - disk interaction @xcite .",
    "as shown by previous work @xcite , rotation period distributions of pms stars are highly dependent on mass .",
    "pms stars of later spectral types behave differently than do stars m2 and earlier , corresponding to masses of m @xmath4 0.25m@xmath5 at the ages of these clusters , according to theoretical evolutionary tracks @xcite ( hereafter , high - mass stars ) .",
    "onc high - mass stars show a bimodal period distribution , while low - mass stars rotate more rapidly than the high - mass stars , with a unimodal distribution peaking at @xmath02 days and a tail of longer periods @xcite . in ngc 2264",
    ", the high - mass stars do not show a clear bimodal distribution , but they do rotate more slowly than the low - mass population . the low - mass period distribution is also more sharply peaked than the high - mass distribution . due to the difference in the color contrast between the stellar photosphere and the inner disk",
    ", nir excess tends to be greater for high - mass stars than for low - mass stars @xcite , and since lower mass stars tend to rotate faster than higher mass stars , this can result in a correlation between nir excess and rotation period that is not necessarily connected to star - disk interaction .",
    "therefore , these two different populations must be studied separately .    _",
    "spitzer _ s infrared array camera ( irac , 3.68.0 @xmath2 m ) @xcite allows the first observations sensitive enough at mid - ir wavelengths to accurately determine the presence of inner circumstellar disks for a statistically significant number of pms stars with known rotation periods .",
    "the observations at every irac wavelength are also observed concurrently , overcoming previous limitations caused by stellar magnitude variations between observations .",
    "however , even with an accurate identification of circumstellar disks , biases and selection effects can still mask useful measurements of the effects of star - disk interaction on young stellar populations . as discussed in  [ data ] and  [ results ] , selecting a uniform and complete sample of stars is critical in order to be able to detect the role star - disk interaction has on the angular momentum evolution of pms stars .",
    "what follows is a more detailed discussion of the mixed results of previous searches for the effects of star - disk interaction on rotation period distributions in each cluster .",
    "virtually all @xmath0500 known rotation periods in ngc 2264 can be collected from two studies @xcite .",
    "@xcite conduct a study of 201 stars in this cluster .",
    "they examine the hypothesis that star - disk interaction regulates the angular momentum of pms stars by searching for a correlation between rotation period and 4 different disk indicators ( u - v , i@xmath6k@xmath7 , h  k@xmath7 , and h@xmath3 ) .",
    "they find `` no conclusive evidence that more slowly rotating stars have disk indicators , or that faster rotating stars are less likely to have disk indicators . ''",
    "@xcite investigate the disk regulation hypothesis in ngc 2264 by studying rotation period distributions of ctts and wtts using a r@xmath6h@xmath3 vs. r@xmath6i@xmath6 color criterion to distinguish between the two populations .",
    "they find that the distribution of rotation periods of the high - mass ctts and wtts populations `` looks quite different '' even though `` the statistics are poor . ''",
    "namely , according a kolmogorov - smirnov test , they find that there is a 0.02 probability that the distribution of high mass ctts and wtts are equivalent .",
    "they attribute this marginally significant difference in the rotation period distribution to the fact that the stars classified as ctts are more likely to have a disk than those classified as wtts .",
    "although they attempt to separate stars by both mass and disk presence , their results are hampered by an inefficient disk identifier .",
    "fewer than half of their high - mass stars , for example , are used in their analysis ( 72 out of 184 ) , leaving 112 stars as ambiguous disk identifications .      with over 900 known rotation periods ,",
    "the onc has been the focus of most studies of the angular momentum evolution of pms stars .",
    "@xcite conduct a study of 34 t tauri stars from taurus and the onc , ranging in spectral type from k7 to m1 and in age from 1 to 10 myrs .",
    "they show a correlation between h - k excess and rotation period for these stars ; however , in a subsequent study by @xcite for stars in the onc , no such correlation was found .",
    "@xcite find a strong period dependence on stellar mass and confirm the bimodal distribution for high - mass stars originally suggested by an earlier study from that group @xcite .",
    "they explain that the previous study by @xcite did not exhibit the bimodal period distribution because its sample was dominated by low - mass stars .",
    "they find a `` weak but significant '' correlation with period among stars with m @xmath8 0.25 m@xmath9 , but argue that the strongest evidence for disk - locking is the bimodal distribution itself .",
    "@xcite study 4 fields in the outer onc , surrounding but not including the trapezium region .",
    "they conclude that `` there is no unambiguous correlation of period with i@xmath6-ks , h - ks , and u - v color excesses or more indirect disk indicators ; the slowest rotators are not necessarily the disk candidates , and the disk candidates are not necessarily the slow rotators , regardless of how one defines a disk candidate '' @xcite .",
    "subsequently , @xcite show a correlation between rotation period and i - k excess for stars in the onc which they claim has a `` very high '' level of significance .",
    "they find that slower rotators with periods @xmath86.28 d show a mean ir excess emission , @xmath10(i  k ) = 0.55 @xmath110.05 , and more rapidly rotating stars with periods @xmath123.14 d have a mean @xmath10(i  k ) of 0.17 @xmath110.05 . with this result",
    ", they claim , `` the long - suspected , but somewhat controversial , correlation between rotation and excess infrared emission , which is relevant to the disk - locking hypothesis , is finally confirmed at a very high significance level .",
    "there is no doubt now that more slowly rotating stars in the onc have , on average , greater infrared excess emission than do their more rapidly rotating counterparts '' @xcite .",
    "this correlation between rotation and the magnitude of the excess infrared emission has been interpreted by the herbst group as conclusive support of the star - disk interaction hypothesis @xcite .    however , having failed to find a correlation between period and disk indicators such as h@xmath3 emission , u - v color excess , and k - l color excess , other groups have a different interpretation of the @xcite results and argue that the observed correlation between period and the magnitude of the infrared excess does not represent strong support for star - disk interaction .",
    "@xcite state that `` the size ( and indeed the presence ) of the nir excess need not be well correlated with the presence of a circumstellar disk owing to the combined effects of inclination and inner disk hole effects ( see hillenbrand et al .",
    "1998 ; mathieu 2003 ) .",
    "therefore , correlations between period and nir excess strength are not necessarily particularly meaningful '' @xcite .",
    "@xcite express similar concerns about the @xcite result , and add an additional one : a mass effect .",
    "they argue that the `` the level of i  k excess depends upon a number of factors : disc mass , inclination angle , inner disc hole size and disc structure .",
    "it also depends strongly upon stellar mass , with excesses around high - mass stars being much stronger than excesses around low - mass stars ( hillenbrand et al .",
    "1998 ) . what this means for the onc",
    "is that the low - mass stars , which are rotating rapidly , will necessarily exhibit smaller i  k excesses than the high - mass stars , which rotate more slowly .",
    "such an effect could easily be responsible for the apparent correlation between rotation rate and infrared excess .",
    "the claims that the onc offers strong support for disc locking should therefore be interpreted with caution '' @xcite .",
    "we note that the slow and fast rotators ( @xmath13 @xmath12 1 radian / d and @xmath13 @xmath8 2 radian / d , corresponding to periods longer than 6.28 days and shorter than 3.14 days , respectively ) , for which the @xcite study finds very different ir - excess distributions , indeed have very different mass distributions . in their short - period sample ,",
    "there are twice as many low - mass stars as high - mass stars ( 80 vs. 40 ) , while in their long - period sample , there are only 34 low - mass stars vs. 84 high - mass stars .",
    "moreover , the mean ir excess emission for long - period stars in the onc found by the herbst et al .",
    "study ( @xmath10(i  k ) = 0.55 ) is increased significantly by the 8 stars ( all high - mass ) with the highest excesses in the group .",
    "recently , using _ spitzer _",
    "irac data as a more reliable disk indicator , @xcite studied the angular momentum problem in the onc central and surrounding regions using periods from the literature .",
    "having been able to accurately determine which stars have disks and which do not , they were able to show a connection between stellar rotation and the presence of a circumstellar disk .",
    "in particular , they show that stars with periods shorter than 1.8 days are significantly less likely to have a disk that stars with periods longer than 1.8 days .",
    "however , they also find that `` among the slower rotators ( stars with periods @xmath8 1.8 days ) , the period distributions for stars with and without disks ( [ 3.6][8 ] @xmath8 1 and @xmath12 1 , where bracketed notation indicates irac colors ) are statistically indistinguishable . ''",
    "though suggestive , by itself this result does not lend conclusive support to the star - disk interaction scenario because the short - period objects that represent the correlation make up less than 20% of the entire population , leaving over 80% of the objects showing no correlation .",
    "also , this 1.8-day period cut is arbitrary , chosen in order to maximize the result rather than for a specific scientific reason .",
    "other factors , such as an overabundance of close binaries among fast rotators , could also account for the low disk fraction in this population @xcite . as shown in ",
    "[ data ] and  [ results ] , even when using _ spitzer",
    "_ colors as a disk indicator , a general correlation between disk fraction and rotation period can only be seen across the entire period range after the mass effects and sensitivity biases are removed from the sample .      to date",
    ", only two groups have searched for a period - disk correlation in ic 348 ( @xmath03myrs ) .",
    "@xcite study a sample of 50 periodic stars and search for a correlation between period and k - l color excess ( available for 30 stars ) and h@xmath3 ( available for 43 stars ) , but find no significant correlation .",
    "thanks to a very deep irac gto survey ( 1600 sec exposures / pixel ) , ic348 is the only cluster of the three discussed in this paper that currently has deep - enough observations to reach the photospheric level of the entire sample of periodic stars at all four irac wavelengths . in paper",
    "i , a study of ic 348 using these _ spitzer _ data , we find a similar result to the one reported by @xcite in the onc , although with a smaller level of significance given the size of our sample .",
    "namely , in a total sample of @xmath0130 stars with rotation periods , we find a small subset of cluster members that rotate with periods shorter than @xmath02 days , showing a significantly lower disk fraction than the rest of the cluster population .",
    "we also find no statistically significant difference between the rotation period distribution of stars with and without disks at periods longer than @xmath02 days .",
    "we analyze the populations of stars with and without disks regardless of stellar mass and the populations of high - mass and low - mass stars independently .",
    "when the entire sample is considered , we find a bimodal distribution of periods for the stars with disks which offers no support for star - disk interaction .",
    "however , after subdividing by mass the population of stars with and without a disk , there are too few stars in each mass bin for the disk and no - disk population to make the analysis as a function of period statistically meaningful ( see  [ meffect ] ) .",

    "the fact that both _",

    "since low - mass stars suffer from these two effects which render the current sample unreliable , we must segregate the sample by spectral type ( corresponding to masses given by evolutionary tracks ) . since brighter high - mass stars do not suffer as much from these sources of sample bias and contamination ( reddened low - mass stars",

    "in  [ results ] , we have discussed the significant differences in the period distributions of low- and high - mass stars in ngc 2264 and the onc .",
    "these differences are not fully understood but can be partially accounted for by the fact that lower mass stars of a given age have smaller radius , r. thus , for a given specific angular momentum , @xmath24 ( @xmath24 @xmath25 r@xmath20/p ) , they are in fact expected to have a a shorter period , p @xcite . however , since @xmath24 still seems to be higher for low - mass stars than for the high - mass counterparts , it has also been suggested that the disk regulation mechanism is less efficient in low - mass stars than in high - mass stars due to differences in accretion rates and the strength or structure of their magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "it is easy to show , by making a slightly different mass cut in our onc analysis , that even small inaccuracies in spectral classification can lead to a severe blending of the period distributions of stars with and without disks . in fig .",
    "[ oncmasscut ] , we compare the mass cut we use in our analysis ( left panel ) to a slightly different mass cut , including lower - mass stars by one spectral sub - type in the sample ( right panel ) . because low - mass stars inherently rotate faster than high - mass stars , regardless of the presence of a disk ,",
    "contaminating the high - mass sample with low - mass stars will mask the effect star - disk interaction has on pms star rotation periods .",
    "the extreme sensitivity of period distribution to mass is difficult to explain in terms of slowly varying quantities such as radius and accretion rates .",
    "the observed dependence of rotation periods on mass is most consistent with the picture that a _ sudden _ change in the strength or structure of the magnetic field at the boundary between m2 and m3 stars is responsible for the observed differences in period distributions of low - mass and high - mass pms stars .",
    "we note that , depending on the evolutionary tracks used , the masses corresponding to given spectral types will change .",
    "@xcite tracks , for example , give slightly higher masses than do those of @xcite .",
    "however , the boundary we draw between the high- and low - mass samples is based on spectral type , and our conclusions are not affected by the difference in the corresponding masses derived from different evolutionary tracks .",
    "the vast majority of stars of the masses and ages of those considered in our study are fully convective .",
    "unfortunately , the dynamos operating in fully convective stars are far less understood than the solar - type dynamo , which operates in the boundary layer between the convective envelope and the radiative core .",
    "models disagree on the magnetic field strengths and topologies that can arise from fully convective stars @xcite and are clearly not advanced enough to predict how the strengths and topologies depend on stellar mass @xcite .",
    "the extreme sensitivity of period distribution to stellar mass could represent an important observational constraint for the theoretical work in the area .",
    "the extreme sensitivity of period distribution to mass also explains previous _",
    "results that showed inconclusive evidence of the star - disk interaction scenario .",
    "@xcite found a separate sub - population of fast rotators with p @xmath26 2 days with a low disk fraction ( where there are few high- or low - mass stars with disks ) and statistically indistinguishable period distributions for stars with and without disks at p @xmath8 2 days ( as is the case with ngc 2264 when analyzing the entire sample instead of only high - mass stars ) .",
    "the longer - period stars in those results are a blend of high- and low - mass stars which have different period distributions , affected by something other than star - disk interaction alone .    in paper",
    "i , we obtain the same result for ic 348 because that cluster has too few member stars with known rotation periods to study the high- and low - mass samples separately ( fig .",
    "[ ic348 ] ) . as a result , after isolating the small sample , we find only a 1-@xmath27 hint that the high - mass stars rotating slower than the median ( p = 6.2 days ) have a higher disk fraction ( 50@xmath14 @xmath11 10@xmath14 [ 12/24 ] ) than the high - mass stars rotating faster than the median ( 39@xmath14@xmath11 10@xmath14 [ 9/23 ] ) .",
    "we predict that once a significant number of rotation periods ( 100 - 150 ) become available for high - mass stars in ic 348 and its surroundings , the same clear increase in disk fraction with rotation period seen in ngc 2264 ( fig .",
    "[ ngchigh ] ) and the onc ( figs .",
    "[ onchighmassall ] and [ onchighmassregion ] ) will become evident in the ic 348 region as well .",
    "our results from  [ results ] show that by restricting the sample of pms stars studied to those with an accurately determined mass range , and by using a reliable disk indicator like the photometry from _",
    "spitzer s _ irac instrument , clear observational signatures of star - disk interaction become evident . using _ spitzer _",
    "mid - ir data as a disk indicator , we can finally progress from first - order issues such as whether or not circumstellar disks regulate the angular momentum evolution of pms stars to ones such as what initial conditions and pms star and disk parameters are consistent with the observed period distributions of stars with and without a disk , or what constraints the observed distributions can place on disk evolution .    for instance , comparing the observed period distributions to monte carlo simulations ( introduced by @xcite and improved upon in the discussion in paper i ) can give us information about the disk - release time of pms stars and the efficiency with which the disks drain their angular momentum .",
    "results from @xcite suggested that a significant fraction ( @xmath030@xmath14 ) of high - mass stars must evolve conserving angular momentum from the time they form in order to reproduce the bimodal distribution observed in the onc . in the context of star - disk interaction , this implies an extremely short disk lifetime ( @xmath12 1 myr ) for a significant number of stars .",
    "preliminary comparisons of the period distributions of stars with and without a disk presented herein against much more detailed monte carlo models @xcite confirm the @xcite result .",
    "short disk lifetimes are also detected independently in the results of recent _ spitzer _ surveys @xcite that find that up to 50@xmath14 of the youngest wtts ( age @xmath28 1 myr ) show photospheric emission in the mid - ir ( 8.0 - 24.0 @xmath2 m ) .",
    "our monte carlo models show that the period distribution of the stars lacking disks are very sensitive to short disk dissipation timescales because the effects of star - disk interaction are more important at early ages when the stars undergo very rapid contraction .",
    "the sensitivity of current pms star rotation period distributions to short disk dissipation time scales allows this type of numerical analysis to put valuable constraints on both disk dissipation and planet formation time scales , and , hence , possibly formation mechanisms .",
    "a detailed comparison of the observed period distributions of ngc 2264 and the onc presented herein to monte carlo models will be presented in a follow - up paper ( paper iii ) .",
    "the high mass stars in the two clusters studied in this work , the onc and ngc 2264 , have substantially different rotation period distributions .",
    "in particular , ngc 2264 lacks the long period peak at @xmath0 8 days and its stars with disks show a much flatter distribution than do those in the onc .",
    "@xcite argue that ncg 2264 is twice as old as the onc and represents a later stage in rotational evolution . by assuming that at the age of the onc , ngc 2264 had the exact period distribution as the onc has today",
    ", they estimate that @xmath080@xmath14 of the stars in ngc 2264 have spun up from the time it was the age of the present - day onc until now , while only @xmath030% have remained locked to their disks .",
    "however , the difference in rotation period distributions is also likely constrained by initial conditions and formation environment .",
    "characteristics such as stellar density , cluster imf , and overall cluster mass might play a role in the angular momentum evolution of pms stars .",
    "the kind of numerical models described above can be used to test whether the period distributions observed in the onc will naturally evolve into the period distributions observed in ngc 2264 or if different initial conditions and model parameters are required to reproduced the observed period distribution of each cluster .",
    "the observations of ngc 2264 and the onc studied here only represent a small fraction of the _ spitzer _ data capable of playing a role in disentagling the steps in the evolution of pms stars and their disks .",
    "_ spitzer _ data currently exist for tens of young nearby clusters awaiting photometric monitoring campaigns to obtain rotation periods .",
    "further studies of other clusters of different ages ( from @xmath121 to @xmath810 myrs ) will provide a broader age baseline with which to study the evolution of angular momentum of pms stars , while the study of clusters of different sizes will establish the importance of pms stellar environment on this evolution .",
    "the only current complete sample of stars with rotation periods in either of the well - studied clusters focused on in this work is the high - mass sample , or stars of spectral type m2 and earlier .",
    "although these stars provide a very clear signature that star - disk interaction is regulating the spin - up of pms stars as they contract onto the main sequence , the whole story is as yet untold .",
    "lower mass stars , half of all stars with known rotation periods , can not currently be studied to see if their rotation periods are similarly affected by their circumstellar disks as no cluster has _",
    "data deep enough to provide an unbiased sample of low - mass stars .",
    "it is clear that the rotation period behavior of these stars is very different from their high - mass counterparts , but the reason for this difference is still unknown .",
    "these stars might have a lower overall disk fraction than high - mass stars , which would explain the more rapid rotation of these objects .",
    "however , if their were no difference in the disk fraction of these stars , then something internal to the star itself , resulting in a different magnetic field structure for these objects , could prevent star - disk interaction from regulating their angular momentum in the same way it does for high - mass stars .",
    "the only cluster currently suited to be studied in this way is ngc 2264 , both because it is a rich cluster with many member stars with known rotation period , and because it has a low enough background brightness to allow deep _ spitzer _ observations to detect bare stellar photospheres for the entire periodic sample .",
    "we combined stellar rotation periods of the young cluster ngc 2264 from the literature with _ spitzer _ photometry in order to search for the correlation between slow stellar rotation and mid - infrared excess predicted by disk regulation through star - disk interaction .",
    "we also re - analyzed results from the recent @xcite study of the onc using the similar criteria to those used in the ngc 2264 analysis .",
    "these two clusters combined contain the vast majority of all known rotation periods of pms stars .",
    "thanks to the unprecedented disk detection capabilities of _ spitzer _ , our results provide the strongest observational evidence to date that star - disk interaction regulates pms star angular momentum .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarized as follows :    \\1 ) when stars of all masses in ngc 2264 are considered together , the only significant result is the lower disk fraction of objects with short periods ( p @xmath26 2 days ) , a range that contains only @xmath020@xmath14 of the periodic stars , with respect to that of the rest of the sample .",
    "this is the same result found by @xcite for the onc , and by itself provides only ambiguous support for the disk regulation paradigm .",
    "however , we show that the apparent lack of a clear overall correlation between period and ir - excess across the entire period range is due to the strong dependence of rotation period on stellar mass and a sensitivity bias against low - mass stars lacking disks .",
    "\\2 ) when only the high - mass stars ( r - i @xmath12 1.3 ) in our ngc 2264 sample are considered , the correlation between stellar rotation and ir - excess becomes evident across the entire period range of the sample .",
    "\\3 ) the ngc 2264 periodic sample of low mass stars ( r - i @xmath8 1.3 ) with 8.0 @xmath2 m data ( used for disk identification ) is highly biased against the fastest rotators .",
    "the bias in the low - mass star sample can be explained if the fastest rotators are the lowest - mass stars in the sample and/or preferentially have no disk .",
    "this bias , which masks disk regulation signatures , does not exist in the high - mass star sample .",
    "\\4 ) when the periodic sample of onc stars presented by @xcite is restricted to high - mass stars with reliable mass estimations , the correlation between stellar rotation and mid - ir - excess becomes apparent across the entire range of the period distribution in the onc sample as well .",
    "\\5 ) we show that the long - period peak ( p@xmath08 days ) of the bimodal distribution observed for high - mass stars in the onc is dominated by a population of stars with disks , while the short - period peak ( p @xmath0 2 days ) is dominated by a population of stars without a disk .",
    "this result confirms one of the main predictions of the star - disk interaction scenario @xcite .",
    "\\6 ) we argue that a quantitative comparison between the period distribution of stars with and without a disk to numerical models is needed to constrain disk regulation parameters such as the angular momentum transfer efficiency , fraction of regulated stars as a function of time , etc .",
    "we will present such a quantitative comparison to monte carlo models in a follow up paper ( paper iii ) .",
    "\\7 ) the current samples of periodic high - mass stars in ngc 2264 and the onc with reliable disk indicators ( e.g. [ 3.6]-[8.0 ] colors ) are fairly large and unbiased .",
    "however , accurate mass indicators ( i.e. , spectral types ) and deeper _ spitzer _ observations are still needed for an unbiased quantitative study of the role star - disk interaction plays in the evolution of low - mass stars .",
    "\\8 ) photometric monitoring of the many other young clusters already observed by _ spitzer _ will reveal the importance of age and stellar formation environments in the angular momentum evolution of pms stars .",
