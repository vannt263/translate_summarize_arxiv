    "grb  990123 was one of the brightest @xmath0-ray bursts detected by the _ _",
    "beppo__sax satellite ; the gamma - ray burst monitor ( grbm ) was triggered by grb  990123 on 1999 january 23.40780 ut , @xmath2  s after the cgro trigger ; the burst was detected for about 100  s and it presented two major pulses , the brighter of which had a peak intensity of @xmath3  ergs  @xmath4  s@xmath5 between 40700  kev ( fig .",
    "[ figura1 ] ) .",
    "grb 990123 was also associated with the first observation of a prompt optical emission @xcite , of a short lived radio emission @xcite and of a clear break in the optical afterglow light curve @xcite .",
    "the total fluence between @xmath6  kev and @xmath7  kev was @xmath8  ergs  @xmath4 ; this value improves the one given in the paper by amati et _ al .",
    "_ @xcite . for the wfc and grbm data during the first three rotse exposures we find a spectral slope of @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the extrapolation of the high energy time resolved spectra to optical frequencies falls at least 2 orders of magnitude below the simultaneous optical measurements ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , suggesting different physical origins for the emission mechanism at low and high frequencies and confirming the idea of a reverse shock origin for grb  990123 optical flash @xcite .",
    "a more detailed description of the wfc and grbm data analysis of the prompt emission and of the broad - band afterglow modeling presented in the following section , is given in corsi et _ al .",
    "the _ _ beppo__sax follow - up observation lasted from 1999 january @xmath10  ut until january @xmath11  ut . the source was detected by the lecs and mecs units , and also observed by the pds in the 1560  kev energy band .",
    "the 210  kev flux decreases with time as a power law of index @xmath12 ; see the paper by maiorano et _ al . _",
    "@xcite for a complete description of the wfc , mecs and pds light curves in the 210 kev and 1528 kev energy bands . during the first day",
    ", the optical flux in the gunn r band decreases with @xmath13 @xcite . for the lecs ( 0.12  kev ) , mecs ( 210  kev ) and pds ( 1560  kev ) data during the first @xmath14  ks , we find a best fit spectral index of @xmath15 .",
    "different values for the optical - to - ir spectral index before the time of the break have been reported ; those values are between @xmath16 @xcite and @xmath17 @xcite . in our following discussion , we consider the mean optical - ir observed spectral index of @xmath18 , as derived by holland et _ al . _",
    "@xcite , and address for the case @xmath19 @xcite in the final part .    in the standard synchrotron fireball model ,",
    "the closure relationships are : if @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 ; if @xmath25 , @xmath21 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "the corresponding values for @xmath29 , @xmath15 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 ; @xmath32 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , respectively . for @xmath20",
    "the relationship involving the temporal indices is not satisfied ; for @xmath39 , those involving @xmath40 are not , giving evidence for a too flat x - ray spectrum .",
    "it is then difficult to interpret grb  990123 afterglow within the basic synchrotron model .",
    "we thus consider a model in which the x - ray emission is dominated by ic - scattering of lower energy photons , while the optical one is synchrotron dominated . in the slow - cooling ic dominated phase @xcite , with @xmath39 and @xmath41 , the closure relations are : @xmath21 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath24 , all verified within @xmath44 ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath35 ) . using @xmath48 ( as derived from @xmath13 ) we obtain @xmath49 , @xmath50 , for the synchrotron and ic component spectral indices , respectively .",
    "after having expressed the parameters of the fireball model as functions of @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , by minimizing the energy requirement and fitting the 0.160 kev spectrum with a synchrotron+ic spectrum , we get : @xmath55  ev , @xmath56jy , @xmath57 , @xmath58jy ( fig .",
    "[ figura3 ] ) and @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "we estimate the jet opening angle @xmath63 @xcite using @xmath64  d , and obtain @xmath65 ; this implies @xmath66  ergs for the energy in the jet .",
    "a value of the order of @xmath67 for @xmath68 has recently been proposed by panaitescu et _ al .",
    "finally , we consider the consistency of the model with the @xmath69  ghz data @xcite ; we have : @xmath70 , about a factor of @xmath71 above the observations , that are lower than @xmath72  @xmath73jy @xcite .",
    "thus , the radio upper limits are not satisfied . as an alternative different approach ,",
    "we leave unchanged the emission mechanism but change the hydrodynamics : if @xmath74 kev , the optical to x - ray spectral index @xmath75 @xcite implies @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , that agree at the @xmath79 level with the spectral indices found by maiorano et _ al .",
    "_ @xcite . to account for",
    "the temporal decay indices , we change the hydrodynamics by letting @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( @xmath82 is the observer time ) and obtain @xmath83 , so the shock should lose energy , and @xmath84 .",
    "these indices give @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the radius of the shock , that implies @xmath87 .",
    "thus , in this alternative scenario , the shock should lose energy while the density should increase rapidly with radius ."
