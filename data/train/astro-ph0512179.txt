    "late time gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglow emission has been well observed and studied since the first detection in 1997@xcite . in contrast , afterglow shortly after or during the main grb is still quite uncertain because of the lack of observation",
    ". this early afterglow may provide important information about initial parameters of the burst and shed light on explosion mechanism .",
    "swift is able to observe multi - wavelength radiation rapidly after @xmath0 ray triggering . with new observations",
    ", the early stage should be investigated more profoundly . in the standard baryonic grb fireball model , prompt grb emission",
    "is produced by collisions of internal shocks while afterglow comes from interactions between burst - ejected materials and circum - burst medium . after the internal shock phase , as the fireball is decelerated by the circumburst medium , usually a pair of shocks develop @xcite .",
    "one is a forward shock ( fs ) expands outward to heat the external medium , the other is a reverse shock ( rs ) propagates into the ejecta and heats this cold initial shell .",
    "the central energy is gradually transmitted to outer medium through shocked mediums and shocked ejecta .",
    "the early afterglow studied in this paper is during this transition stage .",
    "@xcite pointed out rs should emit detectable optical synchrotron photons .",
    "this prediction has been confirmed by the optical flash and the radio flare detected in grb 990123@xcite .",
    "the later more detailed investigation suggests that the rs region may be magnetized @xcite .",
    "the rs emission of grbs in stellar wind medium has been discussed @xcite . the rs emission powered by the magnetized outflow or",

    "they are grb 021211 @xcite , grb 041219a @xcite and grb 050525a @xcite .",
    "whether the lack of rs emission events is due to observational limits or theoretical problems may be settled by further observation .",
    "x - ray flash ( xrf ) is an interesting phenomenon which resembles grb .",
    "it is similar to grb in many aspects except its lower peak energy ( @xmath110kev ) and lower isotropic energy ( @xmath2ergs ) .",
    "several models are proposed@xcite among which the structured jet model is widely discussed .",
    "when a jet is ejected and propagating , observers on different viewing angles will see different phenomena .",

    "after the rs crosses the shell , no new electrons are accelerated in the shocked shell anymore and all the electrons cool at the same rate caused by the adiabatic expansion of the fluid .",
    "no electrons exist above @xmath43 , so the flux above @xmath113 drops exponentially .    at a particular time",
    "@xmath37 , the photons received by the observer comes from an equal arriving time surface determined by @xcite @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the angle between the radiation region and the viewing line in the burst frame .",

    "whether it is in the fast or slow cooling phase is parameters dependent .",

    "in this section the early afterglow from isotropic ejecta is presented at first .",
    "then we calculate afterglows powered by different jets .",
    "three kinds of jets are considered .",
    "they are the uniform jet , the gaussian jet , and the power - law jet . the sideways expansion of these jets is ignored in our calculation .",
    "the obstacle we encountered in the current work is the poorly known initial lorentz factor of these jets , especially for the structured ones ( the gaussian jet and power - law jet ) . by now , the spectrum of most xrfs are non - thermal .",
    "the emitting region should be optical thin , i.e. , the optical thickness @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the comoving width of the emitting region , @xmath121 is the comoving number density of electrons contained in the emitting region .",
    "@xmath122 is the isotropic luminosity of the burst , @xmath123 is the typical variability timescale of the burst lightcurve . assuming that xrfs are powered by internal shocks , the optical thin ( @xmath124 ) condition yields ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath125    @xcite have performed a numerical investigation on the hydrodynamical evolution of a gaussian jet by assuming @xmath126 is also gaussian . in the monte carlo simulation of zhang et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , @xmath126 has been taken as a free function but to find that a flat or only small fluctuation angular distribution of lorentz factor is indeed required . therefore , and partly for convenience , we take @xmath127 for off - axis uniform jet , the gaussian jet , and the power - law jet .    for each jet model , light curves with typical parameters from three viewing angles",
    "are presented , which may correspond to grbs , xrrgs and xrfs respectively .",
    "the light curves differ from each other although there are some universal properties .",
    "viewing from the center of a jet , the light curve is approximately the same as that powered by an isotropic ejecta at the early time and a break occurs when the emission from the edge comes into view .",
    "when we observe off - axis , the flux is lower at the early time but gradually converge into the light curve from the center when the whole jet can be seen .      the upper panel of fig.1 shows the early r band light curve from isotropic ejecta in ism case with typical parameters .",
    "the rs dominates the very early r band light curve , peaks at about 14mag .",
    "the rs is non - relativistic at @xmath51 with @xmath128 .",
    "therefore @xmath129 is greater than the prompt duration @xmath130 .",
    "the r band arising index is @xmath131 , which is shallower than the analytical estimation of nrs @xcite .",
    "it varies with time as well as with initial parameters @xcite .",
    "after @xmath51 , the decay index is @xmath132 until @xmath133 .",

    "the flux after the break comes from equal arriving time surface emitted at lower radius . since @xmath134 is reduced by ssc , it reaches the r band and the rs flux encounters faster decay shortly after @xmath51 . due to the rapid decay of rs emission , the later emission is mainly contributed by fs .",
    "it is interesting to note that the late fs emission bump vanishes when the ssc effect has been taken into account .",
    "the physical reason is that with ssc effect , the fs flux peak time appears earlier at @xmath135 during fast cooling . since @xmath136 and @xmath137 , the decay index following the peak flux is quite flat(-1/4 ) and change to @xmath138 after @xmath139 .    in stellar wind environment",

    "the rising index is about 4.2 .",
    "after @xmath51 , the observed fs flux keeps rising for some while , peaks several hours later .",
    "the peak fs emission flux of xrrg is about 17mag and 17.5mag for xrf .",
    "therefore in xrfs , the rs component can hardly be seen and the later fs component around 1hour is much more luminous . in xrrg ,",
    "the rs emission is detectable but the rs component is not significant .",

    "the off - axis rs flux is exactly the same with isotropic emission taking @xmath177 .",
    "the rs is non - relativistic and the lorentz factor is high at early time .",
    "so the jet structure can not change the light curve significantly .",
    "as @xmath156 increases , the light curve has ( i ) shorter @xmath51 ; ( ii)lower peak rs emission flux , about 17mag for xrrg and 19.5mag for xrf ; ( iii ) flatter rising before @xmath51 ; ( iv ) longer @xmath178(the time @xmath179 ) , therefore longer time interval for the @xmath180 delay after @xmath51 .    in stellar wind ,",
