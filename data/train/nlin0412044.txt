    "controlling chaotic transport is a key challenge in many branches of physics like for instance , in particle accelerators , free electron lasers or in magnetically confined fusion plasmas . for these systems , it is essential to control transport properties without significantly altering the original system under investigation nor its overall chaotic structure . here",
    "we review a control strategy for hamiltonian systems which is based on building barriers by adding a small apt perturbation which is localized in phase space , hence confining all the trajectories . for more details on the methods ( including exact results and numerical implementations , we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we consider the class of hamiltonian systems that can be written in the form @xmath0 i.e.  an integrable hamiltonian @xmath1 ( with action - angle variables ) plus a small perturbation @xmath2 . generically , it is expected that the phase space of @xmath3 is a mixture between regular and chaotic behaviors .",
    "the transition to hamiltonian chaos occurs by successive break - ups of invariant kam tori which foliate the phase space of @xmath1 . for two degrees of freedom ,",
    "it is worthwhile noticing that this transition is very similar to phase transitions in statistical mechanics , in the sense that it can be described by hyperbolic invariant sets of a renormalization operator  @xcite .",
    "more than 25 years ago , chirikov  @xcite stated an empirical criterion based on the overlap of primary resonances in order to get an idea on how chaos arises in hamiltonian systems and to get rough estimates of the threshold of large scale diffusion .",
    "the idea of chirikov is that chaos is obtained when the primary resonant islands overlap , i.e. , when the distance between two of them is smaller than the sum to their half - widths .",
    "we now consider a small modification of the original system @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is smaller than @xmath2 with an appropriate norm of functions ) .",
    "the perturbation @xmath5 introduces generically additional resonances .",
    "therefore from chirikov s criterion , it is expected that there will be more overlaps of resonant islands and hence more chaos .",
    "the aim of our control strategy is to tailor appropriate perturbations @xmath5 acting in the opposite direction , namely such that the hamiltonian @xmath4 has more smooth invariant tori and hence is more regular than @xmath0 contrary to the conventional wisdom inherited from chirikov s criterion . for practical purposes ,",
    "the control term should be small with respect to the perturbation @xmath2 , and localized in phase space ( i.e.  the subset of phase space where @xmath5 is non - zero is finite and small ) .    in this article",
    ", we highlight a method of control on a specific and paradigmatic example , the forced pendulum .",
    "we compute explicitly the formula of the control term which is able to create an isolated barrier of transport .",
    "we show that not only our method of control provides a control term which is much smaller than the perturbation but it also provides the explicit location of the created invariant torus which is a crucial step in order to localize the action of the control .",
    "the localized control method has been extensively described in ref .",
    "@xcite where the corresponding rigorous mathematical results were proved .",
    "we state here the main result of this paper . for a hamiltonian system written in action - angle variables with @xmath6 degrees of freedom ,",
    "the perturbed hamiltonian is @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is a non - resonant vector of @xmath10 . without loss of generality",
    ", we consider a region near @xmath11 ( by translation of the actions ) and , since the hamiltonian is nearly integrable , the perturbation @xmath2 has constant and linear parts in actions of order @xmath12 , i.e.   @xmath13 where @xmath14 is of order @xmath15 .",
    "we notice that for @xmath16 , the hamiltonian @xmath3 has an invariant torus with frequency vector @xmath17 at @xmath11 for any @xmath14 not necessarily small .",
    "the controlled hamiltonian we construct is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a smooth characteristic function of a region around a targeted invariant torus .",
    "we notice that the control term @xmath5 we construct only depends on the angle variables and is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a linear operator defined as a pseudo - inverse of @xmath22 , i.e.  acting on @xmath23 as @xmath24 note that @xmath5 is of order @xmath25 .",
    "this can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : e4v ] ) since @xmath5 can be rewritten as @xmath26 and @xmath14 is quadratic in the actions . here",
    "the dependence of the control in the actions @xmath27 is in the function @xmath19 . for any perturbation @xmath2 ,",
    "hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : gene ] ) has an invariant torus with frequency vector close to @xmath17 .",
    "the equation of the torus which is constructed by the addition of @xmath5 is @xmath28 which is of order @xmath12 since @xmath29 is of order @xmath12 .",
    "there is a significantly large freedom in choosing the function @xmath19 .",
    "it is sufficient to have @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "for instance , @xmath30 would be a possible and simpler choice , however representing a long - range control since the control term @xmath32 would be applied on all phase space . on the opposite way",
    ", we can design a function @xmath19 such that the control is localized around the created invariant torus .",
    "the support of the function is reduced to a small neighborhood of the torus @xmath33 .",
    "the main advantage of this step function is that it needs fewer energy ( only in the part of phase space where the control is localized ) and also it does not change the other part of phase space , not altering the overall chaotic structure of the system . in particular , the dynamics is not changed in the region of the dominant resonances .",
    "therefore a clever choice for the localization is @xmath34 where the parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 are small and @xmath37 is sufficiently smooth on @xmath38 ( for instance of class @xmath39 ) .",
    "one example of @xmath40 is depicted on fig .",
    "[ fig : omegaloc ] .    _",
    "remark  : _ the amplitude of the control term is proportional to @xmath25 . however , if the aim of the control is to create a given invariant torus ( e.g. , specified by its frequency @xmath41 ) , the control only makes sense if the invariant torus with frequency @xmath41 does not already exist in the original ( uncontrolled ) system . in other words , for @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the threshold of break - up of the invariant torus , there is no need of control since the uncontrolled hamiltonian has an invariant torus acting as a barrier ( or an effective barrier ) to diffusion .",
    "however , we point out that , below the critical threshold @xmath43 , the specific location of the invariant torus in the uncontrolled system is not known exactly in general ( this is in particular the case for the forced pendulum described below ) . with a small modification of the potential ( adding the proposed control term ) , there is an exact formula  ( [ eqn : eto ] ) giving the equation of the torus .    in the next section",
    ", we will see on a specific example that the amplitude of the control term is small compared with the perturbation .",
    "we notice that it was the case for @xmath44 drift motion which was considered in refs .",
    "@xcite and that it was also the case for the experimental control in the traveling wave tube ( twt )  @xcite .",
    "we consider the following forced pendulum model @xmath45 . \\label{hpend}\\ ] ] if we consider the chirikov s criterion , it leads to an estimate of the threshold of large scale chaos @xmath46  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the mechanism of the transition to chaos is much more complex than what it is hinted by this empirical criterion .",
    "several methods have been developed since to get much deeper insight into the mechanism and also to get more accurate values of the transition to chaos ( e.g. , greene s residue criterion  @xcite , frequency map analysis  @xcite and renormalization method  @xcite ) .",
    "the large scale diffusion is due to the break - up of the last kam torus . for this model",
    ", the last invariant torus is the one with frequency @xmath47 and its critical threshold is @xmath48  @xcite .",
    "a poincar surface of section is depicted on fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for @xmath49 .",
    "as expected , a large chaotic zone takes place between the two primary resonances since all the kam tori are broken for this value of @xmath12 .    a first and simple idea to control the system would be to reduce the amplitude of one of the two primary resonances by considering the following control term which is of order @xmath12  : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is an additional control parameter . in this case",
    "the control term becomes @xmath52.\\ ] ] figure  [ fig4 ] shows a poincar section of hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : hcdumb ] ) for @xmath49 and @xmath53 . as expected the size of the upper resonance decreases but this significant reduction of a primary resonance ( which results in a decrease of the chirikov parameter ) does not succeed in creating an invariant torus in between the two resonances .    in order to create an invariant torus , one needs to choose @xmath54 which requires too much energy for the control .",
    "in addition , even if @xmath51 satisfies the required condition , there is no explicit formula for the equation of the created invariant torus which is crucial in order to localize the control term and hence to reduce drastically the amount of energy necessary for the control .",
    "therefore one has to design another strategy which has two main goals  :    * find a small control term @xmath5 which creates an invariant torus between the two resonances , * know explicitly the location of the created invariant torus in order to localize the control .",
    "in what follows , we show that the method proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite gives a much smaller control term ( of order @xmath25 ) such that it creates an invariant torus whose equation is explicitly known .    in order to compute this apt control term",
    ", this hamiltonian with 1.5 degrees of freedom is mapped in the usual way into an autonomous hamiltonian with two degrees of freedom by considering that @xmath55 is an additional angle variable .",
    "we denote @xmath56 its conjugate action .",
    "the autonomous hamiltonian is @xmath57.\\ ] ] the aim of the localized control is to modify locally hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : h2dof ] ) and therefore ( [ eqn : fp ] ) , in order to reconstruct an invariant torus with frequency @xmath41 .",
    "we assume that @xmath41 is sufficiently irrational ( diophantine ) in order to fulfill the hypotheses of the kam theorem .",
    "first , the momentum @xmath58 is shifted by @xmath41 in order to define a localized control in the region @xmath59 , i.e.  to get the invariant torus located near @xmath60 for hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : h2dof ] ) for @xmath12 sufficiently small .",
    "the operator @xmath21 is defined from the integrable part of the hamiltonian which is linear in the actions @xmath61  : @xmath62 and hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : h2dof ] ) is @xmath63 where @xmath64+\\frac{p^2}{2}.\\ ] ] the action of @xmath21 on a function @xmath65 of @xmath58 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 defined as @xmath68 is given by @xmath69 for the forced pendulum  ( [ eqn : fp ] ) , we have @xmath70.\\ ] ] the control term given by eq .",

    "we notice that we can subtract to the control term @xmath5 any function which is constant in @xmath67",
    ". in particular , we can substract to the control term its fourier components with @xmath76 for any @xmath77 .",
    "this can be seen by looking at hamilton s equations and , since @xmath19 is constant ( equal to 1 ) in the region near the invariant torus , the equations of motion are the same in this region with or without the function depending only on time .",
    "therefore the control term can be reduced to three fourier modes @xmath78.\\ ] ]    _ remark  : _ we consider a forced pendulum when there are two parameters , one for the size of the primary resonances and another for the distance between them  : @xmath79.\\ ] ] by rescaling the actions and by rescaling time , this hamiltonian reduces to the forced pendulum  ( [ eqn : fp ] ) with @xmath80 .",
    "if we fix the value of @xmath12 to the value of the break - up of the last kam surface @xmath81 ( or to another value greater than this one , representing the degree of chaoticity in the model ) , then we have @xmath82 . if we compute the control term in the original variables for a rescaled frequency @xmath83 ( since we want to keep @xmath840,1 [ $ ] ) , it leads to the following control term  : @xmath85 if we fix the degree of chaoticity @xmath12 constant and eliminate the parameter @xmath86 , the amplitude of the control term is proportional to @xmath87 .",
    "therefore the control term is of order @xmath88 for the model  ( [ eqn : fpd ] ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath89 is also proportional to @xmath12 which is in general small , makes the control term for hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : fpd ] ) very small compared with the size of the perturbation . + we consider the following norm of a function @xmath90 as @xmath91 the norm of the perturbation is @xmath92 and the norm of the control term given by eq .",

    "for instance , for @xmath97 and @xmath41 close to @xmath98 , this ratio is approximately 7% . for the numerical computations we have chosen @xmath47 and @xmath49 . for these values of the parameters ,",
    "the ratio @xmath94 is about 15% .    a poincar section of the controlled hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : hc ] ) for @xmath49 shows that a lot of invariant tori are created with the addition of the control term precisely in the lower region of phase space where the localization has been done ( see fig .  [ figcg ] ) .",
