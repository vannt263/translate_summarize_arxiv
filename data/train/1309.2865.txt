    "there is currently a long literature on the numerical approximation of fbsde with lipschitz conditions ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references within ) . in this article",
    "we address the case of fbsdes with drivers having polynomial growth in the state variable , which has not been studied before , and provide customized analysis of various implicit and explicit schemes .",
    "the importance of fbsdes with non - linear drivers is due to the fruitful connection between fbsdes and partial differential equations ( pdes ) .",
    "many biological and physical phenomena are modeled using pdes of parabolic type , say for @xmath1\\times { \\mathbb{r}}^d$ ] @xmath2 with @xmath3 a second order elliptic differential operator and certain measurable functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "a very large class of such equations can be linked to the solution process @xmath6 of certain forward - backward stochastic differential equations ( fbsde ) with the following type of dynamics for @xmath1\\times { \\mathbb{r}}^d$ ] , @xmath7 $ ] and @xmath8 a brownian - motion @xmath9 via the so called non - linear feynman - kac formula : @xmath10 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in many applications of interest , like reaction - diffusion type equations ,",
    "the function @xmath4 is a polynomial ( in @xmath11 ) , for example the allen - cahn equation , the fitzhugh - nagumo equations ( with or without recovery ) or the standard non - linear heat and schrdinger equation ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references ) .    motivated by these applications we look further at the connection between parabolic pdes and fbsdes with monotone drivers @xmath4 of polynomial growth ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . by monotonicity",
    "we mean that @xmath12 , for some @xmath13 , and any @xmath14 ( one can also find the terminology that @xmath4 is 1-sided lipschitz ) .",
    "we extend the above mentioned works by providing further regularity estimates for the fbsde in question ( modulus of continuity , path and variational regularity ) .",
    "then , we proceed to a thorough analysis of various numerical methods that open the door to monte carlo methods for solving numerically the corresponding pdes .",
    "the applicability of the results we develop here is not restricted to the modeling of physical phenomena .",
    "it is also possible to extend the work we develop to the brownian - lvy setting and apply it for instance to problems of contingent claim hedging in defaultable markets , see e.g. instance @xcite .",
    "the work and results we present should be understood as a first step in the numerical analysis of fbsde with monotone drivers of polynomial growth , wider than the lipschitz driver bsde setting , with the intent of deepening the applicability of fbsdes to reaction - diffusion equations .",
    "moreover , we work without assuming knowledge on the density function or the moment generating function of the forward process @xmath15 . in some applications where @xmath15 is simply the brownian motion",
    ", it is possible to derive a numerical solver that takes advantage on this knowledge , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the work we develop aims at black - box type algorithms which do not take advantage of any of the specific forms the fbsde s coefficients may take .      to better understand why the explicit euler scheme seems not to be suitable for approximating the solution to bsdes with non - lipschitz drivers , let us consider the following simple example ( for further details and notational setup see section [ sec : preliminaries ] and appendix [ appdx : motivatignexample ] ) @xmath16\\ ] ] with the terminal condition @xmath17 .",
    "for any @xmath18 for @xmath19 there exists below . ] a unique ( square - integrable ) solution @xmath20 to the above bsde .",
    "fix the number of time - discretization points to be @xmath21 .",
    "the explicit euler scheme for the above equation with uniform time step @xmath22 is , with the notation @xmath23 , given by @xmath24= { \\mathbb{e } } [ y_{{{i+1}}}(1 - hy_{{{i+1}}}^2 )    @xmath25 .",
    "it is a simple calculation ( see appendix [ appdx : motivatignexample ] for the details ) to show that if @xmath26 with this simple computation in mind it is possible to show that there exists a random variable @xmath27 whose moments of any order are finite and for which the explicit euler scheme diverges .",
    "the result below is a corollary of lemma [ lemma - counterexample ] that can be found in appendix [ appdx : motivatignexample ] .",
    "[ lemma : eulerdoesntwork ] let @xmath28 be the uniform grid over the interval @xmath29 $ ] with @xmath30 points , @xmath31 an even number ( @xmath32 is common to all grids @xmath33 ) .",
    "for any @xmath34 , for @xmath19 , let @xmath20 denote the solution to .",
    "then there exists a random variable @xmath35 for any @xmath19 such that @xmath36=+\\infty,\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the euler approximation of @xmath38 on the time point @xmath32 via over the grids @xmath28 .",
    "the special random variable @xmath27 we work with is normally distributed and it is known that @xmath39 $ ] is exponentially small ( see lemma [ lemma : propertiesofbm ] ) .",
    "what our counter - example shows is that although @xmath27 may take very large values on an event with exponentially small probability , the impact of these very large values when propagated through the euler explicit scheme is doubly - exponential ( see ) .",
    "this double - exponential impact is precisely a consequence of the superlinearity of the driver . in general",
    ", the terminal condition @xmath27 is an unbounded random variable ( rv ) so there is a positive probability of the scenario where @xmath40 no matter how small a time - step we choose .",
    "this indicates that , in general , the explicit euler scheme may diverge , as it happens in sde context @xcite .",
    "therefore one needs to seek alternative ( for example implicit ) approximations for bsde with polynomial drivers that are also monotone and/or find conditions under which it is possible for the explicit scheme to work , as explicit schemes have certain computational advantages over implicit ones .",
    "* we extend the canonical zhang path regularity theorem ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , originally proved under lipschitz assumptions , to our polynomial growth monotone driver setting proving in between all the required stochastic smoothness results ; essentially all 1st order variations of the solution processes and estimates on the modulus of continuity . * for our non - lipschitz setting we provide a thorough analysis of the family of @xmath41-schemes , where @xmath42 $ ] characterizes the degree of implicitness of the scheme .",
    "contrary to the fbsdes with lipschitz driver we show that choosing @xmath43 is essential to ensure the stability of the scheme , in a similar way to the sde context ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this is to our knowledge the first result in the numerical bsdes literature that shows a superior stability of the implicit scheme over the standard explicit one .",
    "we also generalize the concept of stability for discretization schemes ( see that in @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "this , among others things , paves a way for deriving higher order approximations schemes for fbsdes with non - lipschitz drivers . as an example , we prove a higher order of convergence for the trapezoidal scheme ( the case @xmath44 ) . *",
    "we construct an appropriately tamed version of the explicit euler scheme for which the required stability property can be recovered .",
    "this allows to obtain convergence of the scheme .",
    "interestingly enough , in the special case where the driver of the fbsdes does not depend on the sde solution it is enough to appropriately tame the terminal condition , leaving the rest of the euler approximation unchanged .    as a rule of thumb ,",
    "implicit schemes tend to be more robust than explicit ones .",
    "unfortunately implicit schemes involve solving an implicit equation , which creates an extra layer of complexity when compared to explicit schemes .",
    "a secondary aim of this work is to distinguish under which conditions explicit and implicit schemes can be used .    as standard in numerical analysis , we derive the global error estimates of various numerical schemes by analyzing their one - step errors and stability properties ( which allows to study how errors propagate with time ) .",
    "we formulate the _ fundamental lemma _",
    "( following the nomenclature from @xcite ) that states how to estimate the global error of a stable approximation scheme in terms of its local errors .",
    "the lemma is proved under minimal assumptions .",
    "we stress that a similar approach has been used in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , however their results are not sufficiently general to deal with non - lipschitz drivers .",
    "the structure of the global error estimate given by the fundamental lemma allows to study in a very easy and transparent way the special case of the @xmath41-scheme with @xmath44 ( trapezoidal rule ) which has a higher order of convergence . in this context",
    "we also conjecture a candidate for the 2nd order scheme .    concerning the implementation of the presented schemes we propose an alternative estimator of the component @xmath45 whose standard deviation , contrary to usual estimator , does not explode as the time step vanishes .",
    "finally , we note that in proving convergence for the mostly - implicit schemes , we prove @xmath46-type uniform bounds for the scheme , thus extending the classical @xmath47-bound obtained previously for the discretization of lipschitz fbsdes ( see @xcite , @xcite and references therein etc ) .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section [ sec : preliminaries ] we define notation and recall standard results from the literature . in section [ sec : regularity ]",
    "we establish first order variational results for the solution of the fbsdes as well as stating the path regularity results required for the study of numerical schemes within the fbsde framework .",
    "the remaining sections contain the discussion of several numerical schemes : in section [ section : numerical.discretization ] we define the numerical discretization procedure and state general estimates for integrability and on the local errors . in section [ section : theta.implicit.schemes ] we establish the convergence of the implicit dominating schemes and in section [ section : explicit.scheme ] the convergence of the tamed explicit scheme ( after the terminology of @xcite ) . in section [ section : numerics ]",
