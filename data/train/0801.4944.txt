    "one of the most subtle and peculiar problems in condensed matter physics concerns the nature of the `` glass '' state , and of the associated glass transition .",
    "this problem ( described by p. w. anderson@xcite in 1995 as `` the deepest and most interesting problem in solid - state theory '' ) concerns the overwhelmingly dominant component of the physical world as we experience it , ie . , non - conducting solids that are not ordered in regular crystalline arrays .",
    "in fact the glass problem actually involves two separate features .",
    "one is the remarkable universality displayed in the low-@xmath3 quantum properties@xcite , and the other is the high-@xmath3 behaviour shown in the vicinity of the glass transition itself@xcite .    at first glance",
    "it seems implausible that these two features of glasses could be related - they occur at very different energy scales .",
    "elsewhere we argue that there may be an interesting connection , which depends on certain novel features of the interactions in these systems .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to investigate the form of these interactions in some detail .",
    "we derive a number of new interaction terms , which are presented in the form of two new effective hamiltonians for neutral glasses , one valid for higher temperatures , the other in the low-@xmath3 limit .",
    "we begin with a brief introductory review of the physics of neutral glasses , particularly in the low @xmath3 quantum regime .",
    "we then derive the form of the defect - phonon interaction terms ( section [ sec : bareh ] ) , including both a direct linear coupling to the lattice displacement field , and a coupling to the gradient of this field .",
    "we then calculate , in sections [ sec : dumb ] and [ sec : dumb+ ] , the effective coupling between defects induced by these interactions . it is shown in section [ sec : dumb ] that the linear coupling not only gives the well - known ising coupling between the rotational tunneling modes , but also a random field acting on these modes .",
    "however there is no such linear coupling between phonons and the inversion symmetric defects ( ones which are symmetric with respect to inversion about the local lattice site ) . in section [ sec : dumb+ ]",
    "we calculate the coupling of these defects to gradients of the phonon field , and show that this coupling produces another weaker coupling to a random field generated by the now frozen rotational modes , as well as a short - range coupling between the inversion symmetric tunneling defects .",
    "the main point of the present paper is to find the correct quantitative form of the effective hamiltonian for these systems , after integrating out the phonons .",
    "we end up with an effective hamiltonian at high @xmath3 which involves only the rotational defects , and then another quite different low-@xmath3 hamiltonian which describes a set of tunneling inversion symmetric defects , coupled to each other and to the random field generated by the frozen rotational modes ; this includes a number of new terms .",
    "it turns out that these results have very interesting implications for the physics of glasses , which are discussed in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "the first glass conundrum , strongly emphasized by leggett@xcite , is the apparent universality in the low - t properties of a huge variety of disordered systems below a temperature @xmath4k , regardless of the amount of disorder .",
    "the most striking universalities are seen in    \\(i ) the q - factor @xmath5 for torsional oscillations of the system , which is related to the phonon mean free path @xmath6 and the phonon thermal wavelength @xmath7 by @xmath8 .",
    "one finds@xcite that @xmath5 shows a pronounced plateau for @xmath9 ( down to a lower temperature which decreases with @xmath10 ) , and that the value @xmath11 varies over only a factor @xmath12 between many different materials , even though the intrinsic disorder ( measured by e.g. , defect concentration x ) may vary over several orders of magnitude .",
    "\\(ii ) the `` berret - meissner ratio '' @xmath13 between longitudinal and transverse sound velocities in the same low - t regime .",
    "a remarkable linear relationship is found@xcite between @xmath14 and @xmath15 , for a variety of materials including amorphous oxide , semiconducting , polymer , metallic , and electrolyte glasses , in which @xmath15 varies by a factor of @xmath16 .",
    "these are only the most striking of the low t universalities - there are others@xcite .",
    "in recent years the experimental groups of osheroff@xcite , hunklinger@xcite , and enss@xcite have pushed experiments to very low temperatures [ @xmath17 mk ) ] , and found a host of interesting new results , including intrinsic dipolar `` hole - digging '' in the many - body density of states@xcite , and a remarkable spin coherence phenomenon@xcite which comes from nuclear quadrupolar interactions in neutral glasses . the dynamical hole - digging persists to the lowest temperatures , giving ever sharper features in the density of states ; it is associated with non - exponential relaxation and aging behaviour of the dielectric constant of the system .",
    "it would be of interest to continue these measurements well into the @xmath18 regime , if possible .",
    "although we are clearly dealing here with a resonant tunneling phenomenon@xcite , qualitatively similar to that in tunneling spin systems@xcite the glass problem apparently involves cooperative tunneling of at least coupled pairs of tunneling systems@xcite , and the resulting low - t `` universal '' state apparently involves some fundamental new physics .",
    "although a number of theoretical scenarios have been proposed to describe this universal physics@xcite , most of which argue that it must involve strong coupling between the relevant low-@xmath3 modes , there is no complete consensus at the present time .",
    "we note in passing that although the universalities occur in the same temperature range as the well - known regularities@xcite in thermal and transport properties in glasses ( such as the specific heat @xmath19 , or the thermal conductivity @xmath20 ) , these latter can all be understood in terms of the well - known picture@xcite of non - interacting two - level systems(tlss ) . on the other hand",
    "the dynamics of dipolar hole - digging certainly requires interactions for its explanation , between whatever modes are exhibiting low-@xmath3 quantum fluctuations , whether these be pairs of tlss@xcite or some more complicated set of modes@xcite .      in most glasses there is actually a glass transition at a temperature @xmath1 much higher than the crossover temperature @xmath21 to the universal quantum regime ( typically @xmath22 ) .",
    "there are several universal features of this transition as well@xcite , amongst which one may single out ( i ) the characteristic range of relaxation times @xmath23 in the system , and their characteristic t dependence , summarized in the vogel - fulcher scaling law , which shows that the value of @xmath1 we use depends on the timescale in interest ; ( ii ) the `` entropy crisis '' , in the range @xmath24 , were @xmath25 is the kauzman temperature , and where one finds a supercooled glass entropy lower than that of the crystalline solid ; and ( iii ) the existence of highly non - exponential relaxation , and characteristic memory and aging effects , in the vicinity of the glass transition ( as noted above , these effects are also found in the low - t quantum regime , both in neutral glasses where universality is seen@xcite and in electronic glasses@xcite ) .    at first glance",
    "there seems to be no obvious relation between this high - t behaviour , which is characterised by thermally - activated processes of great complexity , and the low - t behaviour .",
    "a number of attempts have been made in the last couple of years to give a general theory of the glass transition@xcite .",
    "two of them@xcite made no connection to the low - t regime , instead concentrating on the vast number of thermally - activated processes coming into play near @xmath1 .",
    "the moore - yeo theory also makes a very interesting connection between the critical behaviour of supercooled liquids near @xmath1 and ising spin glasses in a magnetic field .    however , there are several arguments that indicate that there may be a connection between the physics below @xmath21 and that near @xmath1 .",
    "the first two are experimental .",
    "it was already noticed by berret and meissner@xcite that the low - t phonon relaxation time @xmath26 shows systematic connection to the values of @xmath1 across the whole range of glasses , with @xmath27 .",
    "we have already remarked on the rough proportionality @xmath22 ; and indeed one can argue that the coupling @xmath28 between phonons and the low - t tunneling entities ( whatever they may be ) is intrinsically related to both @xmath1 and the phonon velocities@xcite .",
    "these observations suggest that there may be some kind of unified theoretical framework which could describe both the high and low - t properties of glasses .",
    "such a theory would not only be of major interest ( answering the question posed by anderson@xcite ) but it would also clearly give us a new blueprint for theories of other complex systems .",
    "such a framework has actually been proposed very recently by lubchenko and wolynes@xcite . in this theory the basic objects",
    "are `` tunneling centers '' which comprise @xmath29 atomic units , and which can be used to describe both the low - t dynamics and the dynamics near @xmath1 .",
    "we note that these `` tunneling entities '' are very different from the tlss that have been used to describe many of the low - t experiments@xcite , although it is argued that their behavior will be quite similar@xcite .",
    "we now come to the question to be addressed by this paper .",
    "one might think , in view of the generality of the phenomena discussed above , that they ought to be independent of the detailed nature of the interactions between tunneling entities in the low - t regime .",
    "actually it is widely assumed in the glass literature that it is enough to include only dipolar strain - mediated interaction , with the addition of electric dipolar interactions where necessary .",
    "this assumption rests on a number of microscopic calculations done over the years , both for interacting tlss@xcite , and for the more complicated systems of discrete rotators that exists in orientational glasses@xcite .",
    "these calculations ( particularly those for orientational glasses ) are very lengthy , and for this reason have not been attempted with any generality except by a few authors .",
    "nevertheless , the conclusion has been that the effective interaction between @xmath30 tunneling entities a distance @xmath31 apart is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a coupling @xmath34ev ) , with both dipolar strain and electric dipole contributions .",
    "the length @xmath35 is a typical lattice distance ; and we have suppressed an angular factor which has roughly dipolar symmetry .",
    "we note that all of the principal scenarios for the low - t behaviour of glasses assume ( [ dipint ] ) to be true ; moreover they rely upon it in an essential way .",
    "but is ( [ dipint ] ) really correct ? in this paper",
    "we shall argue that in fact ( [ dipint ] ) is incomplete , and that the correct form contains extra terms of some importance .",
    "these include another term falling off like @xmath36 , which however leads to a random field acting on each tunneling rotator .",
    "there are also terms which are weaker and which fall off faster , which would be less important except that they act on 2-level systems that do not see the first random field .",
    "the net result of this is that we derive two effective hamiltonians for the system , one which is valid at higher temperatures around @xmath1 and the other at much lower @xmath3 , apparently around the temperature @xmath21 which defines the crossover to the universal properties .",
    "in what follows we will be dealing with neutral glasses , i.e. , we ignore metallic and superconducting glasses .",
    "this of course still includes the overwhelming majority of materials on earth , from rocks and minerals to a galaxy of insulating compounds ( based mostly on transition metals ) , along with a huge variety of natural and artificial organic systems ( including polymers ) .    in spite of this variety , and regardless of whether one is dealing with a strongly disordered amorphous systems or very weakly disordered systems like substitutional electrolyte glasses , the two interactions of main interest are those involving strain fields and phonons , and those involving the interaction of electric fields with local charge distributions .",
    "our tactic in this paper will be to start with a toy model which describes a class of very simple systems , and then argue that the important features of this model can be generalised to a much wider variety of glassy systems .",
    "consider the situation depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , in which we reduce the system to a 2-d plane , and look at defects in this plane .",
    "the underlying local symmetry of the system is assumed to be of square plaquettes , and the defects can either be substitutional defects , able to occupy one of 4 states in the plaquette , or orientational defects , able to rotate between 4 orientational states .",
    "under certain circumstances , to be discussed below , we can make the dumbbell approximation , in which defects rotated by @xmath37 are considered to be indistinguishable - we then treat these 2 states as identical , and the 4-state system reduces to a 2-state system .",
    "now if the concentration of these defects is low we can assume that they do not disturb the underlying lattice symmetry , and interactions between 2 defects , even if they are distantly separated , will be between 2 plaquettes which are oriented along the same axes .",
    "more generally , when the defect concentration is much higher , one may have the situation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where the 2 plaquettes are slightly distorted , and also rotated with respect to each other .",
    "it might be objected that the situation depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is not very realistic , in that a high defect concentration would so severely disrupt the square symmetry that the plaquettes themselves would not only be rotated , but that their shapes would be severely distorted , so that no clear local lattice structure could be defined .",
    "actually this is not the case - quite surprisingly , the situation in even rather strongly amorphous glasses does not conform to the common caricature in which they look like frozen liquids .",
    "instead , at short length scales the underlying lattice structure is still quite recognizable , and the system more resembles a frozen liquid of very small polycrystals@xcite ( actually the instantaneous state of quite a few liquids also looks like this ! ) .",
    "a good tutorial example of systems like our toy model is provided by substitutional electrolyte glasses , where the defects can be characterized very precisely .",
    "canonical examples are @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and so on@xcite .",
    "many experiments in these systems have been done in the very dilute regime , with concentrations in the range @xmath41 x @xmath42 , where one can ignore the interactions between the widely spaced impurities@xcite .",
    "however there are also many studies of concentrations up to x @xmath43 or even higher .",
    "when @xmath44 , interactions between the impurities clearly dominate the physics in most of these systems@xcite .",
    "this is shown in , e.g. , the saturation in the dielectric response for higher concentrations@xcite .    in real 3-dimensional systems like @xmath45 , @xmath46 , or @xmath47 ,",
    "one has either off center point - like impurity states ( as in @xmath48 , with 8 available positions for the @xmath49 impurity inside a given @xmath50 lattice cage ) ; or else orientational ( as in @xmath47 , where the @xmath51 impurity can lie in one of the 8 directions along ( 1,1,1 ) and its equivalents ) .",
    "previous treatments of the microscopic interactions in these systems have taken one of two routes .",
    "michel and collaborators@xcite have used a detailed microscopic description of the orientational and translational degrees of freedom ( and the coupling between the two of these ) with the goal of describing systems where orientational impurities like @xmath51 can rotate inside their host cages. sethna and collaborators@xcite have used a somewhat more general phenomenological description in terms of tls impurities .",
    "the great advantage of beginning with these simple systems is that one can set up a well - controlled theory beginning with the case of dilute defect concentration @xmath52 .",
    "there are good arguments , based on the experiments on electrolyte glasses@xcite and other amorphous systems@xcite , that the theory must , when @xmath52 is larger , flow towards the strong coupling regime ( and perhaps to some universal quantum regime ) .",
    "but it makes no sense trying to explore the strong - coupling limit until the form of the interactions has been established in weak coupling . the key question of interest here ( viz .",
    ", what are these interactions ? ) can only rigorously be addressed by starting from a system where x@xmath53 .",
    "later we will argue that our main results will survive well into the universal regime , and so are of much more general applicability .",
    "returning now to fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we divide the defects into two groups , viz .",
    "( i ) those in which there is an inversion symmetry relating pairs of states , where inversion is made with respect to the relevant lattice position ; and ( ii ) those where there is no such symmetry . in the square plaquette system",
    "we see that both simple impurities like @xmath49 and orientational impurities like @xmath54 or @xmath55 can be in one 4 different states , related by @xmath56 rotations of the plaquette , and there is no inversion symmetry .",
    "however in some cases , one can treat the states related by @xmath37 as physically equivalent ( either because they really are equivalent , or because at the energy scale of interest the difference is unimportant ) , and then we can assume inversion symmetry .",
    "in this case the state space on the plaquette is 2-dimensional , with states oriented along one or other of the lattice diagonals .",
    "to describe the system , the simplest representation is just a 4-state one in which the system can hop between any of the 4 plaquette sites .",
    "however we will use a slightly different one , where we begin by defining a set of operators @xmath57 such that @xmath58 flips the state on the plaquette through @xmath37 , and another set of operators @xmath59 such that @xmath60 rotates the state on the plaquette through @xmath56 in either direction .",
    "this representation is used because we will see that the impurity - lattice interaction turns out to depend crucially on whether inversion symmetry is obeyed , and so this way of setting up the description allows us to distinguish between operations which are or are not invariant under inversion symmetry .    in what follows we will first be considering the effect of phonons on the rotational tunneling degrees of freedom . in general , before we take interactions with phonons into account , these will be described by a hamiltonian @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a tunneling matrix element and @xmath63 is any stray field acting on the rotational defect variable @xmath64 . at lower @xmath3 ,",
    "once the rotational degrees of freedom are frozen out , only the inversion tunneling processes are left , and these are described by a bare hamiltonian @xmath65 where again an `` external '' effective longitudinal field @xmath66 acting on the @xmath67-th dipole is allowed .    often , in the study of the possible phases of the system , the high-@xmath3 tunneling is dropped since it is typically too small to influence the nature of the phase , nor its stability to effective random fields@xcite .",
    "we will keep it simply because we wish to trace how the effective hamiltonian evolves as we lower the energy scale .",
    "consider now the coupling to the phonon modes in the system .",
    "the hamiltonian for this system is given by : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the bare defect term just discussed , and the phonon system is described by @xmath70 here @xmath71 and @xmath72 represent momentum and displacement operators for phonon modes of wave vector @xmath73 and branch @xmath74 , and @xmath75 is the mass of the elementary cell of the medium .",
    "we split the defect - phonon interaction @xmath76 into two terms , writing @xmath77 where the lowest order term is linear in the phonon displacement field : @xmath78 and the next term is a non - linear coupling of the defects to the gradient of this field , of form @xmath79 the linear coupling term @xmath80 contains first a volume coupling with coefficient @xmath81 , which is independent of the defect position or orientation , arising because the defect has a different volume from the host and this locally strains it .",
    "then there is the usual interaction @xmath82 between the defect and the strain field in the `` tls '' or `` dumbbell '' approximation , which changes sign with @xmath83 , since the phonon displacement fields are sensitive to the defect orientation .",
    "the size of these interactions is not easy to calculate - however @xmath82 can be measured , and is on a typical scale @xmath84 ev .",
    "estimates of @xmath81 give similar numbers but the ratio @xmath85 must certainly vary from one system to another ( calculations are difficult because the volume change and charge redistributions caused by the defect will interact with each other ) .",
    "we notice that when inversion symmetry is preserved , there is no linear interaction between the @xmath86 and the phonon field .",
    "the 2nd term @xmath87 arises when we relax the assumption of inversion symmetry , so states rotated by @xmath37 are distinguishable ( either because we relax the `` dumbbell '' approximation , and consider the dipole moment of the impurity or molecule , or because we consider tunneling point impurities ) . in this case",
    "the effective dipole represented by the difference between these states can interact with the gradient of the phonon displacement field , in the form given in @xmath87 .",
    "however this interaction is much weaker , and has rarely been considered before .",
    "certainly we do not expect it to affect the physics near the glass freezing temperature .",
    "however we will see that this interaction is important at lower temperatures , where other degrees of freedom freeze out .",
    "at the present time we can not give more than a rough estimate for the size of the coefficient @xmath88 of this interaction ; noting that its dimensions are @xmath89 = el$ ] ( ie .",
    ", energy times length ) , and that the characteristic energy scale of defect interaction energies is @xmath90 ev , and the characteristic length scale @xmath91 of defect dynamics is roughly @xmath92 , we would expect that @xmath93 . to get an energy from this",
    "we need to divide by the typical distances between impurities , given by @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is a lattice length .",
    "thus we expect that the energy scale associated with this coupling is less than @xmath28 and @xmath81 by a factor @xmath96 .",
    "from now on we will assume that this energy scale associated with @xmath97 is considerably smaller than @xmath98 .",
    "let us begin by assuming that we are at a sufficiently high energy scale that we can neglect the weaker interaction @xmath99 ; we are then concerned with a set of phonons interacting with the @xmath100 tls variables , ignoring the @xmath101 variables .",
    "we wish , in this approximation , to calculate the effective hamiltonian of the system , initially just up to 2nd - order in the defect - phonon coupling .",
    "this is an old problem , but we shall see that even here there are new things to be discovered .",
    "let s look first at the simple problem of 2 interacting defects in this dumbbell approximation .",
    "we split the interaction term @xmath102 into two , to understand the effect of the orientation and volume parts separately , and consider 2 defects at positions @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "then the system has bare hamiltonian : @xmath105 if we now integrate out the phonons we will generate , at lowest order in @xmath80 , terms of ising form ( proportional to @xmath106 ) , cross terms giving a local field , proportional to @xmath107 , plus an energy shift @xmath108 .",
    "the ising form has been known for a long time .",
    "the second term , when summed over all spins apart from one given spin , simply leads to a random field at the site of that spin - this term is not usually considered . in this section",
    "we first sketch the derivation of the ising term , primarily to establish notation , and then derive the random field term .",
    "we define the fourier transformation to momentum space as @xmath109 where @xmath110 is a phonon polarisation index",
    ". then we have @xmath111    to find the interaction in 2nd - order perturbation theory we minimize the potential energy , i.e. the sum of the second term in eq.([phonon ] ) plus the interaction term .",
    "straightforward calculation results in energy terms proportional to @xmath112 and the ising interaction term of interest , proportional to @xmath113 .",
    "let us define the notation @xmath114 , and use an acoustic approximation , in which the longitudinal phonon frequency @xmath115 , the transverse phonon frequency is @xmath116 .",
    "we also have the identities : @xmath117 then the ising interaction @xmath118 , where @xmath119 } .",

    "this interaction has a rather complicated angular dependence , coming both from the anisotropy of the medium , and from the that of the strain interaction @xmath127 .",
    "if we assume a completely isotropic medium with degenerate longitudinal and transverse phonons , and also make the simplification of anisotropic @xmath128 , so that @xmath129 , we get the strictly dipolar form @xmath130   \\label{g_o}\\ ] ] where @xmath131 is the angle between the unit radius vector @xmath132 and the @xmath133-axis ; the characteristic coupling energy @xmath134 is now evident .    as noted before , these results are well - known , and were first derived@xcite in the 1970 s .",
    "the essential result is that one has derived an effective ising interaction ; since the sites of the defects are random , the tunneling terms make this system behave as a quantum ising model with random interactions , and hamiltonian @xmath135 where the tunneling amplitudes @xmath136 are typically much smaller than the nearest - neighbour ising interactions .",
    "however it turns out that this ising interaction is not the only term that is important .",
    "we now include the cross - terms @xmath137 , coming from 2nd - order perturbation theory in the interaction @xmath80 in eq.([hint2 ] ) . using similar manouevres as in the calculation above",
    ", one now obtains another term in the effective interaction of form @xmath138 , where @xmath139 we call this a random field term because if we take a given spin in the system , say @xmath140 , and then sum the interaction @xmath141 between @xmath140 and the volume terms coming from all the other defect sites @xmath142 , we get a field @xmath143 acting on @xmath144 at site @xmath145 which varies from site to site in a random way , because of the random positions and orientations of the arguments @xmath146 .",
    "note , incidentally , that this effective random field interaction has contribution only from the longitudinal phonons .",
    "this interaction is important since , as we show elsewhere , it actually destroys the bulk glass transition@xcite .",
    "let us now explicitly derive its form . to do this",
    "we first evaluate the tensor @xmath147 changing the sum to an integral we get : @xmath148 where again @xmath149 . from symmetry",
    "we have @xmath150 .",
    "consider first @xmath151 .",
    "on one hand this sum can be written as @xmath152 .",
    "on the other hand the sum equals @xmath153 , leading to the identity @xmath154 .    similarly , the scalar @xmath155 in calculating the right side we can choose @xmath156 in any direction , say in the z direction .",
    "this leads to the expression @xmath157 and then using @xmath158 and straightforward integration we find that the integral equals @xmath159 . on the other hand , @xmath160 , leading to the identity @xmath161 , and together with the above identity ( @xmath154 ) to the result that @xmath162 , and @xmath163    thus , one finally obtains @xmath164 this result shows a much less complicated angular dependence than the ising interaction ( [ uzz - real ] ) ; in general we see that they depend differently on angle , simply because the ising @xmath165 is essentially a dipole - dipole interaction whereas this mixed term is a dipole - monopole interaction .",
    "if we make the isotropic assumption that @xmath166 , then @xmath167 . on the other hand if @xmath168 , then we get a dipolar interaction : @xmath169 where @xmath170   \\label{uh - iso}\\ ] ] where now the interaction energy is @xmath171 . in any case , both this mixed term and the ising term end up having the same @xmath172 spatial form , but their characteristic energies are different .",
    "thus , as a result of the added volume term in the impurity - lattice interaction , the effective hamiltonian in the `` dumbbell '' approximation is not the quantum ising model ( [ qising ] ) , but the quantum random field ising model , with hamiltonian @xmath173 where @xmath174 .",
    "this random field has mean zero , as by symmetry there is no preferred direction .",
    "its typical value is given by @xmath175 , where x is the concentration , since it is dictated by the typical distance between nearest impurities .",
    "thus , the typical size of both interactions is rather similar ; we expect that @xmath176 . in typical glassy systems",
    "this means that they are both @xmath177 , where @xmath90 ev .",
    "this means that unless @xmath178 , the typical size of these random fields @xmath179 , where @xmath180 is a typical tunneling amplitude .",
    "note , that the standard deviation of the distribution of the random fields , @xmath181 , as it is dominated by the rare events of pairs of impurities occupying nearest neighbor lattice points ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , noting the trivial relations between high and low impurity densities ) .",
    "the random field quantum ising hamiltonian ( [ rfising ] ) has very different properties from the simple quantum ising system - apart from anything else , the random field can actually destroy the glass transition@xcite .",
    "we do not go into these questions here , but note instead that the most important effect of the ising interaction term , for all but very dilute glasses , is to freeze the tunneling of the @xmath64 variables , except for a very small fraction @xmath182 of systems that happen to be on resonance .",
    "however this is not the end of the story at all .",
    "this is because , as noted above , the @xmath86 variables do not have a linear coupling to the phonons , and so to linear order they experience neither impurity - impurity interactions nor a random field , and thus they are still free variables .",
    "this is why we now have to go to the higher coupling terms .",
    "let us now go to an energy scale very much less than the putative glass freezing temperature .",
    "now we start from a hamiltonian given by @xmath183 where the tunneling amplitude @xmath184 describes the @xmath37 flip of defects .",
    "the first term in this effective hamiltonian is just the random field quantum ising model derived in ( [ rfising ] ) above .",
    "now let us write an approximate version of ( [ fullinteractionh ] ) , which takes account of the fact that the set of spins @xmath185 have almost entirely frozen into some random configuration , with expectation values @xmath186 , because of the strong ising interaction between them ( but without long - range glassy order ) . now in this approximation we can simply ignore the dynamics of the @xmath187 entirely , and replace ( [ fullinteractionh ] ) with another hamiltonian , which is approximately valid when @xmath188 , given by : @xmath189 this hamiltonian is only valid to the extent that we can ignore any tunneling of resonant @xmath187 variables .",
    "consider now the interaction terms in eq.([truncint ] ) .",
    "if we now integrate over the phonons , one expects the interaction between @xmath86 and the phonons [ the 3rd term in ( [ fullinteractionh ] ) ] to give an interaction @xmath190 .",
    "but we notice that there will also be two cross - terms between the two couplings to the phonons , giving an interaction @xmath191 and an interaction @xmath192 .",
    "when summed over the sites @xmath142 , both of these terms must give random fields acting on the @xmath86 variable .",
    "the first of these random fields comes from the frozen @xmath193 degrees of freedom , behaving as a quenched impurity distribution coupling to the @xmath194 degrees of freedom .",
    "the second just comes from summing over all the scalar volume distortions from these frozen impurities .      since @xmath196",
    ", it follows that the two random field terms acting on the @xmath197 interaction will be much stronger than the ising interactions between them ( quite different from what occurs for the @xmath198 ) .",
    "we therefore deal with the two random field terms first , and then look at the ising interaction between the @xmath197 .",
    "the @xmath199 interaction is not only typically the largest ( although @xmath28 and @xmath81 are of the same order , @xmath28 is usually a little larger ) , but also the most tedious to calculate . to do this",
    "we begin by considering the 2 interaction terms @xmath200 which come into the calculation of this interaction when we have only 2 impurities . using eq.([fourier ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath201 again , minimizing the sum of @xmath202 and the potential term in eq.([phonon ] ) one obtains the interaction energy between the two impurities , given by : @xmath203    notice that this interaction is odd in @xmath204 ! this is because the first derivative term is imaginary , and the second derivative term is real , leading to a @xmath205 interaction .",
    "physically , this is clear since an impurity variable which is odd under inversion symmetry , like @xmath206 , must have an interaction which is odd in @xmath204 with other impurities , if these are either substitutional ( ie .",
    ", causing scalar perturbations ) , or are even under inversion .    using again the acoustic approximation , i.e. @xmath207 and the identities in ( [ poli ] ) , we have an interaction @xmath208   \\label{u - st}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is a complicated integral , because of the large number of different components of momentum involved . to evaluate it we begin by writing it in the form : @xmath209 ,   \\label{u - st2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have define the 5th and 3rd rank tensors @xmath210",
    "@xmath211    let us start by calculating @xmath212 .",
    "as a first step we write it in the form @xmath213 where we have defined the integral @xmath214 already here we see that the interaction has a spatial dependence @xmath215 .",
    "in fact , any interaction involving the @xmath216 impurity will have a @xmath217 or larger power spatial dependence ( we find that the @xmath218 impurity - impurity interaction has a @xmath219 dependence ) , and must therefore be treated as a short range interaction in @xmath220d .    by symmetry",
    "the function @xmath221 can be written in the form @xmath222    we wish to find the coefficients @xmath223 and @xmath224 .",

    "to do so let us first consider the term @xmath247 the equality results because the sum gives @xmath248 in the numerator .",
    "this expression is a scalar , which therefore equals @xmath249 .",
    "a careful evaluation of the sum on the left side gives @xmath250 and therefore we obtain as a first relation for @xmath251 that @xmath252    to obtain a second relation we look at the scalar : @xmath253 since the expression is a scalar , we can choose @xmath232 , and the integral becomes @xmath254 , as was calculated above .",

    "now we can write the form of the effective random field term that this leads to , after noting again that almost all the @xmath185 are frozen , and sum over all sites apart from a given site @xmath145",
    ". then we must get a term in the low-@xmath3 effective hamiltonian of form @xmath262 where the random field @xmath263 is given by summing over sites in the interaction we have just derived .",

    "we see that the order of magnitude of the interaction is given by @xmath270 where @xmath28 and @xmath97 are typical values of the corresponding tensors .",
    "now let us consider the other source of random fields acting on the @xmath101 , coming from their interaction with the volume term of other impurities .",
    "this is calculated by considering the cross - term arising from the interaction @xmath271 between the volume interaction at site @xmath272 and @xmath273 .",
    "similar manouevres to the ones used above then lead , in the acoustic approximation , to an interaction term @xmath274 ,   \\label{u - etat}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which reduces to @xmath275 where the definitions of @xmath276 and @xmath277 are the same as above [ _ cf .",
    "( [ gbdn ] ) and ( [ gbdn2 ] ) ] .",
    "note that since the volume term couples only to the longitudinal phonons , @xmath278 depends only on @xmath279 .",
    "the random field resulting from this term is then given in the form of an interaction @xmath280 where the random field @xmath281 is given by @xmath282 with @xmath283 given by ( [ gbdnij ] ) above , and where @xmath284    now we can finally write the random fields acting on the @xmath285 , coming from the gradient phonon term in the defect - phonon interaction , in the form of an interaction term @xmath286 where the random field @xmath287 is just given by the sum of the two contribution we have found , ie . , @xmath288 where the two contributions are given by eqtns . ( [ u - st2 ] ) and ( [ btau2 ] )",
    "respectively , and where @xmath289 .      in the same way we may evaluate the ising interaction between the @xmath290 .",
    "the result is an interaction @xmath291 , where the interaction coefficient @xmath292 now we see that not only is the interaction coefficient here much smaller than that for the random fields ( since @xmath293 ) , but this interaction also falls off much faster with @xmath294 , going like @xmath295 .",
    "for this reason we do not calculate the exact coefficient @xmath296 here : this calculation is rather lengthy , and it simply multiplies the right hand of ( [ zeta2 ] ) by a complicated angular factor @xmath297 .",
    "note that even though @xmath296 is so small , it will still affect the dynamics of the system at low @xmath3 , since there will be still resonant @xmath285 that can tunnel .",
    "let us now summarize what we have .",
    "after integrating out the phonons , we can now say that we have ended up with an effective hamiltonian which , if we still treat all the variables as operators , takes the form @xmath298",
    "\\;\\;+\\;\\ ; v_{eff }    \\label{htotal}\\ ] ] where the interaction now contains the following terms : @xmath299 where we have written the terms in decreasing order of their strength .",
    "the 2 random fields in this effective hamiltonian arise from the phonon - mediated coupling of the @xmath300 and the @xmath301 variables to the volume distortion caused by the defects .",
    "the above effective hamiltonian must be used if we want to analyse the dynamics of these variables . at high energies",
    "@xmath302 , we can entirely drop all the terms involving the @xmath301 in the interaction @xmath303 , since these interactions are all @xmath304 and too weak to play a role . if we ignore the small number of spins @xmath193 that are in resonance",
    ", then we can also assume that the @xmath305 variables are frozen by the strong ising interaction @xmath306 . as discussed elsewhere",
    ", the effect of the random field @xmath307 is then to destroy long - range glassy order@xcite .",
    "now suppose we go to low energy scales .",
    "if we continue to ignore the small quantum fluctuations in the expectation values @xmath308 brought about by tunneling of the small concentration of resonant @xmath193 , then we can treat this distribution as frozen .",
    "then the low - energy hamiltonian simplifies very considerably .",
    "we get @xmath309 where now the interaction term has the much simpler form @xmath310 in which the random field @xmath287 was calculated in the last section , and , as noted before , it is much larger than the ising interaction @xmath296 .",
    "the purpose of the present paper was to give a detailed treatment of the phonon - mediated interactions which exist in a neutral glass , taking into account not only the usual linear coupling between defects and the phonon displacement field , but also the coupling to the gradient of the phonon field .",
    "the net result of this was that we found an effective hamiltonian for the two sets of variables ( the rotational tunneling variables @xmath198 and the inversion tunneling variables @xmath101 ) , which contained tunneling terms for each , ising interaction terms for each , and various effective random fields which act on both variables .",
    "we note that similar issues arise in quantum spin glasses@xcite , where random field terms also have a profound effect ( just as they do in classical spin glasses@xcite ) ; however real spins are in many ways quite different from defects , and this means that there is no simple relation between the two systems@xcite .    these calculations were all done in the framework of 2nd - order perturbation theory in the interactions , and they were all done assuming that the background lattice could still be meaningfully defined , at least in local `` patches '' around each defect .",
    "thus at first glance the calculations here are only rigourously valid for low defect concentration @xmath52 .",
    "two possible problems then arise at higher @xmath52 .",
    "first , one might object that the patch picture must eventually break down - we have argued in section [ sec : bareh ] that this is not the case , because even rather strongly disordered glasses still do have local crystalline order .",
    "the second more serious problem is that one expects higher - order interactions to come in at higher @xmath52 and these will mix the various interactions we have derived here .",
    "this problem of higher - order corrections is notoriously difficult , since a hierarchy of logs is generated once one integrates over multiple sites@xcite . we do not attempt to discuss it here , but simply note that our results inevitably changes the results of these higher - order calculations ,",
    "because of the new terms we have found in this paper ( in fact almost all calculations of these higher order terms include only the tunneling terms and the ising interactions , without any random fields ) .",
    "thus we expect the results here to have important consequences for the discussion of the nature of glasses , and we have developed some of these elsewhere@xcite .",
