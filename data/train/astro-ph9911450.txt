    "since its discovery about one century ago , nuclear radioactivity has been the focal point of a vast amount of fundamental and applied research . with time , it has become clearer and clearer that some radionuclides even try to tell us something quite exciting about certain facets of the universe in general , and about our solar system in particular . with his legendary enthusiasm and expertise ,",
    "jerry wasserburg has searched without respite for the rosetta stone leading to the understanding of the highly complex hieroglyphic message delivered by radionuclides to astrophysicists and cosmochemists .",
    "this contribution is a tribute to this aspect of jerry s mutiple activities .",
    "we will in particular briefly review some selected aspects of nucleo - cosmochronology , as well as of the field of the isotopic anomalies of radionuclidic origin .",
    "additionally , the decay of certain radionuclides manifests itself quite spectacularly through the emission of de - excitation lines in the @xmath14-ray domain .",
    "the study of these radionuclides offers invaluable information on their production sites and is the subject of @xmath14-ray line astronomy , a recently developed astrophysical discipline which has not escaped jerry s intellectual curiosity .",
    "the dating of the universe and of its various constituents , referred to as ` cosmochronology ' , is one of the tantalizing tasks in modern science .",
    "this field is in fact concerned with different ages , each one of them corresponding to an epoch - making event in the past ( e.g.  vangioni - flam et al .",
    "1990 for many contributions on this subject ) .",
    "they are in particular the age of the universe @xmath16 , of the globular clusters @xmath17 , of the galaxy [ as ( a typical ? ) one of many galaxies ] @xmath18 , of the galactic disc @xmath19 , and of the non - primordial nuclides in the disc @xmath20 , with @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ? ) @xmath23 . as a consequence ,",
    "cosmochronology involves not only cosmological models and observations , but also various other astronomical and astrophysical studies , and even invokes some nuclear physics information .",
    "the cosmological models can help in determining @xmath16 , as well as , to some extent at least , @xmath24 and @xmath19 ( e.g. fowler & meisl 1986 , tayler 1986 , clayton 1988 , arnould & takahashi 1990a ) .",
    "the @xmath24 or @xmath19 values have also been evaluated from the use of the herztsprung - russell diagram ( hrd ) ( e.g.  jimenez 1998 , vandenberg et al .",
    "1997 for recent reviews ) , or of so - called ` luminosity functions ' which provide the total number of stars per absolute magnitude interval as a function of absolute magnitudes .",
    "in particular , the luminosity function of white - dwarf stars has been proposed as a priviledged @xmath19 evaluator ( e.g. winget et al .",
    "1987 , hernanz et al .",
    "1994 , oswalt et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "nucleo - cosmochronological techniques have also been developed in order to evaluate @xmath20 , and are briefly discussed below .",
    "each of these methods has advantages and weaknesses of its own , as briefly reviewed by e.g.  arnould & takahashi ( 1990a ) .",
    "the age estimates they provide are sketched in a synopsis form in fig .  1 , which also displays the limits derived from the nucleo - cosmochronological approach briefly discussed below .",
    "1truecm    editor : figure 1 here    1truecm      the dating method that most directly relates to nuclear astrophysics is referred to as ` nucleo - cosmochronology . '",
    "it primarily aims at determining the age @xmath20 of the nuclides in the galactic disc through the use of the observed bulk ( meteoritic ) abundances of radionuclides with lifetimes commensurable with presumed @xmath19 values ( referred to in the following as ` long - lived ' radionuclides ) .",
    "consequently , it is hoped to provide at least a lower limit to @xmath19 .",
    "the most studied chronometries involve @xmath5 or the trans - actinides @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .    in order to establish a good chronometry based on these radioactive nuclides",
    ", one needs to have firstly a good set of input data concerning ( isotopic ) abundances and nucleosynthesis yields , in addition to the radioactive half - lives .",
    "another issue concerns the necessity , and then the possibility , of using detailed models for the chemical evolution of the galaxy in order to gain a reliable nucleo - cosmochronological information if indeed the bulk solar - system composition witnesses the perfect mixing of a large number of nucleosynthetic events . the status of these various requirements is briefly examined in the following sections for several cosmic clocks .      the familiar long - lived @xmath2-@xmath4 and @xmath3-@xmath4 chronometric pairs ( fowler & hoyle 1960 ) are developed on grounds of their abundances at the time of solidification in the solar system some @xmath25 y ago . this information is obtained by extrapolating back in time the present meteoritic content of these nuclides . if the so - derived abundances are affected by some uncertainties , these are not , however , the main problems raised when attempting to use these radionuclides as reliable nuclear clocks .",
    "their usefulness in this respect indeed depends in particular on the availability of precise production ratios .",
    "such predictions at the level of accuracy needed for getting a truly useful chronometric information are out of reach at the present time .",
    "one is indeed dealing with nuclides that can be produced by the r - process only , which suffers from very many astrophysics and nuclear physics problems , in spite of much effort by many researchers .",
    "the r - process problems are particularly acute for the th and u isotopes referred to above .",
    "they are indeed the only naturally - occuring nuclides beyond @xmath26 , so that any extrapolation relying on semi - empirical analyses and fits of the solar r - process abundance curve is in danger of being especially unreliable .",
    "this difficulty is illustrated by the recent calculations of goriely & clerbaux ( 1999 ) .",
    "one has to note , however , that many authors express opposite views on this question ( e.g. pfeiffer et al . 1998 ) .",
    "an additional problem the trans - actinide clocks has to face relates to the fact that most of the r - process precursors of u and th are unknown in the laboratory , and will remain so for a long time to come .",
    "theoretical predictions of properties of interest , like masses , @xmath27-decay strength functions and fission barriers , are extremely difficult , particularly as relevant calibrating data are largely missing .",
    "the problems mentioned above would linger even if a realistic r - process model were given , which is not the case at the present time ( e.g. arnould & takahashi 1999 ) .",
    "last but not least , most of the tremendous amount of work devoted in the past to the trans - actinide chronometry has adopted simple functionals for the time dependence of the r - process nucleosynthesis rate with little consideration of the chemical evolution in the solar neighborhood .",
    "this view , which originated almost 4 decades ago ( fowler & hoyle 1960 ) , has had ( and still has ) a few sympathisers indeed ( e.g. cowan et al .",
    "1991 ; also arnould & takahashi 1999 for some references ) .",
    "the necessity of the development of the long - lived chronometers in the framework of models for the chemical evolution of the galaxy has been first pointed out by tinsley ( 1977 ) .",
    "the introduction of nucleo - cosmochronological considerations in such models is not a trivial matter , however .",
    "the intricacies come in particular from ` astration ' effects , which have to do with the fate of the chronometers once absorbed from the interstellar medium ( ism ) by the stars at their birth ( e.g. yokoi et al .",
    "however , jerry , in collaboration with schramm ( schramm & wasserburg 1970 ) , has made an important contribution to nucleo - cosmochronology by showing that one can make the economy of these chemical evolution models as long as a mere determination of _ age limits _ could satisfy one s curiosity .",
    "this interesting so - called ` model - independent approach ' has led to the conclusion that @xmath28 gy ( meyer & schramm 1986 ) .",
    "there has also been an attempt to develop a th - chronometry ( e.g. pagel 1997 ) on grounds of the relative abundances of th and eu ( which is presumed to be dominantly produced by the r - process ) observed at the surface of a variety of stars with metallicities in a wide range of values ( da silva et al .",
    "1990 , franois et al .",
    "1993 ) . under the assumption , which may sound reasonable , but has not at all to be taken for granted , that any r - process in the past has produced th and eu with a constant solar - system ratio , the age determination is reduced to the problem of mapping the metallicity to time through a chemical evolution model ( e.g. pagel 1997 ) .",
    "this is by far not a trivial matter .",
    "one of the difficulties noted by franois et al .",
    "( 1993 ) arises from the complex trend of the observed th / eu abundance data with metallicity .",
    "the th observations in highly metal - deficient stars ( e.g. sneden et al .",
    "1998 , and references therein ) alleviate the difficulties inherent in the chemical evolution models .",
    "the considered stars have indeed been born in the galaxy at times much shorter than the th decay half - life . as a consequence , th could not have been affected by chemical evolution effects , and only a simple exponential decay law has to be applied .",
    "this does not imply , however , that @xmath20 can be trivially derived from these observations .",
    "one of the main problems again concerns the assumption that the th / eu production ratio is strictly solar in all r - process sites .",
    "there is at best some hint that this could indeed be the case ( sneden et al .",
    "1998 ) , but , in our opinion , it would be premature to interpret this hint as a demonstration .",
    "the th - chronometry could be put on safer grounds if the th / u ratios would be known in a variety of stars with a high enough accuracy .",
    "these nuclides are indeed likely to be produced simultaneously , so that one may hope to be able to predict their production ratio more accurately than the th / eu one .",
    "even in such relatively favorable circumstances , one would still face the severe question of whether th and u were produced in exactly the same ratio in presumably a few r - process events ( a single one ? ) that have contaminated the material from which metal - poor stars formed .",
    "even if this ratio turns out to be the same indeed , its precise value remains to be calculated ( see e.g. arnould & takahashi 1990b for an illustration of the dramatic impact of a variation in the predicted th / u ratio on derived ages ) .",
    "first introduced by clayton ( 1964 ) , the chronometry using the @xmath5-@xmath6 pair is able to avoid the difficulties related to the r - process modeling .",
    "true , @xmath5 is an r - nuclide .",
    "however , @xmath6 is not produced directly by the r - process , but indirectly via the @xmath29-decay of @xmath5 ( @xmath30 gy ) over the galactic lifetime .",
    "this makes it in principle possible to derive a lower bound for @xmath20 from the mother - daughter abundance ratio , provided that the ` cosmogenic ' @xmath6 component is deduced from the solar abundance by subtracting its s - process contribution .",
    "this chronometry is thus in the first instance reduced to a question concerning the s - process .",
    "other good news come from the recent progress made in the measurement of the abundances of the concerned nuclides in meteorites ( e.g.  faestermann 1998 for references ) .",
    "this input is indeed essential also for the establishment of a reliable chronometry .",
    "although the s - process is better understood than the r - process , this chronometry is facing specific problems .",
    "they may be summarized as follows ( see e.g.  takahashi 1998 for a short account ) : 1 ) the evaluation of the @xmath6 s - process component from the ratio of its production to the one of the s - only nuclide @xmath31 is not a trivial matter , even in the simple local steady - flow approximation ( constancy of the product of the abundances by the stellar neutron capture rates over a restricted @xmath32-range ) . the difficulty relates to the fact that the @xmath6 9.75 kev excited state can contribute significantly to the stellar neutron capture rate because of its thermal population in s - process conditions ( @xmath33 k ) ( e.g.  winters et al .",
    "1986 , woosley & fowler 1979 ) .",
    "the ground - state capture rate measured in the laboratory has thus to be modified by a theoretical correction .",
    "in addition , the possible branchings of the s - process path in the @xmath34 region may be responsible for a departure from the steady - flow predictions for the @xmath6/@xmath31 production ratio ( e.g.  arnould et al .",
    "1984 , kppeler et al . 1991 ) ; and 2 ) at the high temperatures , and thus high ionisation states , @xmath5 may experience in stellar interiors , its @xmath27-decay rate may be considerably , and sometimes enormously , enhanced over the laboratory value by the bound - state @xmath27-decay of its ground state to the 9.75 kev excited state of @xmath6 ( e.g.  yokoi et al . 1983 ) .",
    "such an enhancement has recently been beautifully confirmed by the measurement of the decay of fully - ionised @xmath5 at the gsi storage ring ( bosch et al .",
    "1996 , kienle et al .",
    "the inverse transformation of @xmath6 via free - electron captures is certainly responsible for additional corrections to the stellar @xmath5/@xmath6 abundance ratio ( e.g. arnould 1972 , yokoi et al .",
    "further complications arise because these two nuclides can be concomitantly destroyed by neutron captures in certain stellar locations ( yokoi et al .",
    "1983 ) .",
    "all the above effects have been studied in the framework of detailed evolution models for @xmath35 m@xmath36 stars and of a galactic chemical evolution model that is constrained by as many observational data in the solar neighborhood as possible in order to reduce as much as possible the uncertainties that are inherently associated with any model of this type ( takahashi 1998 , takahashi et al .",
    "this work , which is an up - date of yokoi et al .",
    "( 1983 ) with regards to meteoritic abundances , nuclear input data , stellar evolution models and observational constraints , concludes that @xmath37 gy .",
    "even lower ages of about 9 gy , as derived from the model - independent approach ( schramm 1990 , schramm & wasserburg 1970 ; see sect .",
    "2.1 ) , can not conclusively be excluded within the remaining uncertainties in the chemical evolution model parameters .",
    "these results may imply that the @xmath5 - @xmath6 chronometry has not yet much helped narrowing the age range derived from other methods .",
    "there is still ample room for improvements , however , and there is reasonable hope that the re - os chronometry will be able to set some meaningful limits on @xmath20 in a near future , and independently of other methods which suffer from problems of other types .",
    "the long - lived @xmath7 ( @xmath39 gy ) has the remarkable property of being shielded from the r - process , and thus to be a pure s - process product .",
    "some early works ( arnould 1973 , audouze et al .",
    "1972 ) have proposed this radionuclide to be a potential chronometer for the s - process , the other long - lived radionuclides probing the r - process instead .",
    "these studies pointed out some possible uncertainties in the solar @xmath7 abundance , as well as in its production predicted from s - process models .",
    "the latter problem relates directly to the branching in the s - process path due to the 125 kev @xmath40 isomeric state .",
    "more specifically , the two different paths @xmath41(n,@xmath14)@xmath42(n,@xmath14)@xmath43(@xmath29)@xmath44 and @xmath41(n,@xmath14)@xmath45(@xmath29)@xmath46(n,@xmath14)@xmath44 may well develop during a s - process ( @xmath47 designates the @xmath7 ground state ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath47/@xmath46 production ratios depend on the relative importance of these two branchings , and thus mainly on the relative population of the ground and isomeric @xmath7 states .",
    "two limiting situations are relatively simple to handle . the first one is obtained if @xmath47 and @xmath40 have no time in a given astrophysical environment for being connected electromagnetically",
    "this situation is made plausible by the large difference in the spin and @xmath48 quantum number of the two states .",
    "in such conditions , the relative importance of the two s - process branches is just given by the @xmath49/@xmath50 cross section ratio , the value of which can be obtained from experiments .",
    "the other extreme is obtained if @xmath47 and @xmath40 are coupled electromagnetically strongly enough for the relative populations of these two states to be ` thermalized ' , i.e. follow the rules of statistical equilibrium .",
    "in such conditions , the relative importance of the two s - process branches is essentially governed by temperature , as is the effective decay rate of the thermalized @xmath7 .    since the pioneering studies mentioned above",
    ", much work has been devoted to the question of the possibility of thermalization of the @xmath7 isomeric and ground states in astrophysical plasmas , and to the measurement of the neutron capture cross sections needed for the calculation of the s - process @xmath7/@xmath46 production ratio ( e.g. klay et al .",
    "1991 , lesko et al .",
    "1991 , doll et al . 1999 , and references therein ) .",
    "from these efforts , it is generally concluded today that the @xmath47 s - process yields are so sensitive to temperatures and neutron densities that they can not be evaluated precisely enough for chronological purposes .",
    "instead , @xmath47 could rather be considered as a s - process thermometer .",
    "the discovery of isotopic anomalies attributed to the decay in some meteoritic material of now extinct radionuclides with half - lives in the approximate @xmath8 y range ( referred to in the following as ` short - lived ' radionuclides ) has broadened the original astrophysical interest for cosmic radioactivities .",
    "even the ` ultra - short ' radionuclides @xmath51 ( @xmath52 y ) and @xmath53 ( @xmath54 y ; wietfeldt et al .",
    "1999 ) are likely to have left their signatures in some meteorites .",
    "the interpretation of the message from these anomalies has been the focus of much work and excitement .    one important issue raised by the extinct radionuclides concerns their presence in the early solar system in ` live ' form , or just in the form of their daughter products ( ` fossils ' ) . in the first case ,",
    "the anomalies have of course to be located in solar - system indigenous solids , while they have to be found in alien ( presolar ) material in the second situation . at present",
    ", there is clear evidence that meteorites contain both live and fossil signatures of short - lived nuclides , and the messages they carry are quite different indeed .",
    "in contrast , the meteoritic content of the ultra - short - lived nuclides has obviously to be of fossil nature , in view of the lifetimes involved .      at the end of the sixties , jerry and his collaborators ( schramm et al .",
    "1970 ) have contributed in an important way to the pioneering searches for the signatures of extinct radionuclides in meteorites ( e.g. wasserburg & papanastassiou 1982 for a historical account ) by establishing techniques for the high precision measurement of the mg isotopic composition in order to search for @xmath55 excesses due to the @xmath11 decay in meteorites of different types and in lunar samples . from this study , it was concluded that the upper limits on the ( @xmath11/@xmath56)@xmath57 ratio in the analyzed materials was ranging from well below @xmath58 to about @xmath59 .",
    "it is established by now that @xmath11 has been live in the solar system at a canonical level of ( @xmath11/@xmath56)@xmath60 ( macpherson et al .",
    "jerry and his collaborators have also contributed in a significant way to the accumulation of persuasive experimental evidence for the existence of other live radionuclides .",
    "this concerns nowadays @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath12 and @xmath65 .",
    "other likely candidates are @xmath66 and @xmath67 , the presence of which has recently been found to be correlated with the one of @xmath11 in some primitive meteorites ( sahijpal et al .",
    "some weaker evidence has been gathered about @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath13 ( see e.g. podosek & nichols 1997 for a review and references ) .    the demonstrated existence of short - lived radionuclides in live form in the early solar system can usefully constrain the chronology of the nebular and planetary events at that epoch ( e.g. podosek & nichols 1997 for details ) . from a more astrophysical point of view , these observations are generally considered to provide the most sensitive radiometric probes concerning discrete nucleosynthesis events that presumably contaminated the solar system at times between about @xmath9 and @xmath10 y prior to the isolation of the solar material from the general galactic material .",
    "of course , this statement assumes implicitly that the radionuclides of interest have not been synthesized in the solar system itself .",
    "can such a local production scenario be rejected right the way ?",
    "this question has been revisited recently , as briefly mentioned in sect .",
    "if indeed the short - lived radionuclides that have been present live in the early solar system are not of local origin , the message they carry on the chronology of the nucleosynthetic events responsible for a ` late pollution ' of the solar system can obviously not be extracted from the chemical evolution models needed when one deals with long - lived chronometers . instead , a scenario relying on a limited number of events has to be constructed .",
    "one form of such a ` granular ' description is referred to as the ` bing bang ' model ( reeves 1978 , 1979 ) , which envisions the contamination and formation of the solar system in an ob association during its approximate @xmath71 y lifetime .",
    "y. so , if the solar system had been born in an ob association , this star grouping would have disappeared a long time ago ! ]",
    "a chronology based on these granular chemical evolution models raises a series of important and difficult questions related in particular to the type of nucleosynthetic event(s ) responsible for the contamination , the corresponding radionuclide yields , as well as the efficiency of the pollution .",
    "it has to be emphasized that a bing bang type of model does not imply either a contamination by a single astrophysical source , or a strict relation between the contamination and the very formation of the solar system .",
    "in contrast , the possibility for a given star to trigger the formation of the solar system and to contaminate it at the same time has received much attention over the years , and has recently been scrutinized within hydrodynamical models ( e.g. boss & foster 1998 , and references therein ) .",
    "supernovae , asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) or wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars have been identified as possible triggering / contaminating agents .",
    "they are briefly reviewed in sects .",
    "3.2 - 3.4 .",
    "we also make some specific comments on the short - lived radionuclides @xmath13 ( sect .  3.5 ) and @xmath12 ( sect .",
    "3.6 ) which have been explored by jerry in some of his recent works .",
    "supernova explosions are spectacular events representing the endpoint of the evolution of a variety of stars . exploding massive ( @xmath72 m@xmath36 ) stars",
    "are classified as type ii supernovae ( snii ) if hydrogen lines are present in their spectra . some massive stars , and in particular wolf - rayet stars ( see sect .",
    "3.4 ) , may have lost their h envelope at the time of their explosion , which is generally classified as a type ib / c supernova ( snib / c ) .",
    "other supernovae , referred to as type ia ( snia ) are associated with the explosion of a compact star , referred to as a ` white dwarf ' , accreting material from a companion star in a binary system .",
    "the mechanism responsible for the snia is completely different from the one leading to snii or snib / c .",
    "type ii supernovae eject large amounts of nuclearly processed material into the interstellar medium , and could have injected live radionuclides into the solar system forming as a result of the explosion itself . much has been written on the subject , and the reader is referred to e.g. cameron et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for details and further references .",
    "we just want to mention here that jerry and his collaborators ( waserburg et al . 1998 ) have proposed a test of the snii trigger hypothesis based on the @xmath62/@xmath73 ratio that would have to be found in @xmath11-bearing samples if both radionuclides had just been produced by a snii .",
    "similar constraints could come from other stable or unstable nuclides that are predicted to be synthesized in the same snii zones as the above - mentioned radionuclides , or in nearby regions .",
    "from the available experiments and predicted snii yields , wasserburg et al .",
    "( 1998 ) note that the observed @xmath62 abundances appear to be too low to be compatible with a supernova trigger that injected the @xmath11 into the protosolar nebula , the same conclusion also holding for @xmath61 .",
    "on the other hand , it has to be noticed that the snii contaminating role might be enhanced by ( isotopically anomalous ) ` shrapnel - like ' sn grains which have a higher penetration efficiency in the forming solar system than the gas from an expanding sn shell ( margolis 1979 ) .",
    "in addition , such grains minimize the danger of having the isotopic anomalies washed out beyond recognition in the bulk nebular material before the start of the solar system solidification sequence ( of course , this does not exclude grain vaporisation _ during _ the solidification , which seems to be required by the analysis of the isotopic anomalies attributed to the radionuclide in situ decay ) .",
    "the possible role in the sn contamination efficiency of sn ` fast moving knots ' stressed by arnould & nrgaard ( 1978 ) may be nicely complementary to the polluting importance of grains . there is indeed mounting evidence that fast moving knots are priviledged locations of grain formation in sn ejecta ( lagage et al . 1996 ) .",
    "certainly , the details of the contamination are still far from being settled . in any case",
    ", it seems highly plausible that the short - lived radionuclides have been distributed heterogeneously in the forming solar system ( see also podosek & nichols 1997 ) .",
    "this complicated situation may affect quite negatively their chronological predictive virtues .    finally , let us note that other supernova types might also contribute to the synthesis of short - lived radionuclides .",
    "this is especially the case of snib / c which are often interpreted as exploding wr stars .",
    "this production ( in particular of @xmath61 , @xmath62 or @xmath12 ) could complement the non - explosive wr contamination ( see sect .",
    "3.4 ) after a time span that is shorter than the lifetime of the considered radionuclides .",
    "after their central hydrogen and helium burning stages , low- and intermediate - mass stars ( @xmath74 m@xmath36 ) enter the agb phase , characterized by red colors and high luminosities .",
    "most agb stars are observed to have their surfaces contaminated with ashes of h- and he - burning , including s - process products .-",
    "unstable nucleus , if produced , has in general time to decay before capturing a neutron . in such conditions ,",
    "the corresponding nuclear flow is confined to the close vicinity of the line of nuclear stability , and the s - process thus produces the nuclei lying on this line .",
    "the reverse situation is encountered in the r-(rapid)process , where the neutron fluence is so high that the material is pushed deep inside the region of very neutron - rich @xmath27-unstable nuclei . if the neutron concentration decreases or even goes to zero , these nuclei cascade down to the valley of stability until a stable nucleus is reached .",
    "so , the r - process accounts for the neutron - rich stable heavy nuclei , and also complements the s - process contribution to the nuclei at the bottom of the valley of nuclear stability which are not bypassed from the r - process flow by a neutron - rich stable isobar .",
    "the third process , referred to as the p - process , accounts for the stable heavy neutron deficient nuclides .",
    "it is made of the destruction of pre - existing s- or r - nuclides by a variety of nuclear reactions involving the emission of a nucleon or of an @xmath75-particle .",
    "while the s - process develops during non - explosive stages of the evolution of a large variety of stars , the r - process is likely associated with violent stellar phenomena , like supernovae . however",
    ", the precise site for this mechanism has not been identified yet .",
    "the p - process probably develops during snii , and possibly also during the stages just preceding these explosions ( see e.g. arnould & takahashi 1999 for more details ) ] theory relates these observations to the prediction that the structure of these stars is characterized by thin h- and he - burning shells , by the recurrent occurence of convectively unstable so - called ` thermal pulses ' in the he shell , and by the possibility of transport of part of the nuclearly processed material to the surface ( ` third dredge - up ' ) and into the ism ( by strong winds ) .    along these lines",
    ", it has been suggested by cameron ( e.g. cameron 1985 ) , and further studied by jerry and some collaborators ( wasserburg et al .",
    "1994 ) that agb stars might have contributed appreciably to some short - lived isotopes in the ism and in the early solar system . as jerry",
    "is well known to be largely open to scientific debates about unsettled issues , he is most likely ready to acknowledge that the astrophysical plausibility of his contamination scenario and its true efficiency remain to be demonstrated .    apart from the difficult problem of evaluating in astrophysical terms the probability for an agb star to have been able to contaminate the forming solar system with short - lived radionuclides at the level required by laboratory data , many uncertainties remain in the precise evaluation of the radionuclide yields in terms of stellar mass and metallicity .",
    "one such major uncertainty concerns the efficiency of the source of neutrons leading to the development of the s - process in agb stars .",
    "it is generally agreed today that @xmath76 is the relevant neutron producing reaction .",
    "the crux of the problem lies elsewhere , and more specifically in the prediction from ` first principles ' of the available amount of @xmath77 , which has to exceed largely the one emerging from the cno burning of hydrogen in order to allow a fully developed s - process to operate ( this extra @xmath77 is referred to as ` primary ' ) . in these matters ,",
    "the theoretical challenge lies in the proper description of the mixing of matter across a h - he abundance discontinuity that develops in model stars .",
    "such a mixing at the right level and with the correct depth distribution is indeed agreed to be a necessary condition to get the proper s - process .",
    "recent works on that subject consider the effect of rotation ( langer et al . 1999 ) or of diffusive penetration of matter from the convective envelope into the underlying radiative layers ( e.g. herwig et al .",
    "these calculations provide a new basis for the study of the production of the primary @xmath77 . still , most predictions , and in particular those of wasserburg et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , view the amount of that @xmath77 and its variation with position in the star as free parameters .",
    "related uncertainties could of course be reduced on a case by case basis by trying to reproduce at best the s - process abundances observed at the surface of a given star ( e.g. gallino et al . 1998 ) .",
    "this procedure would clearly be of the greatest value for better understanding the @xmath77 production mechanism if quantities like the stellar masses and metallicities of the considered stars were known , which is often not the case .",
    "another serious uncertainty relates to the quantity of c- and s - process - enriched matter dredged - up to the surface after each thermal pulse . in this field , too , significant progress has been made recently ( e.g. mowlavi 1999 ) .",
    "the proper modeling of the dredge - up process and the reliable evaluation of the production of primary @xmath77 may actually be closely linked to each other .",
    "they would open the door to a more consistent study of the yields of short - lived isotopes from agb stars .    among those radionuclides",
    ", @xmath11 holds a special position .",
    "it is demonstrated by now that @xmath11 has been live in the early solar system ( sect .",
    "3.1 ) , and has also entered it in extinct form , carried by a variety of pre - solar grains ( sect .",
    "as if this were not enough , @xmath11 also exists in live form in the present ism ( sect .",

    "hot enough pulses for neutrons to be liberated by @xmath80 could destroy part at least of the pre - pulse @xmath11 . a recent detailed discussion of the net @xmath11 production by pulsing agb stars can be found in goriely ( 1999 ) .",
    "these conclusions still need to be confirmed by agb models producing consistently some primary @xmath77 .",
    "reliable yields from agb stars are thus still awaiting improved stellar models , even for the ` simple ' case of @xmath11 .",
    "1truecm    editor : figure 2 here    1truecm    the case of @xmath13 , to be considered in more details in sect .",
    "3.5 , deserves also a brief comment here .",
    "the importance of agb stars as a potential source of @xmath13 has first been envisioned by yokoi et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , and revisited by jerry and collaborators ( wasserburg et al .",
    "1994 ) , as well as by mowlavi et al .",
    "the latter authors performed the first quantitative study of the ability of @xmath13 to _ survive _ in neutron - free locations in between thermal pulses .",
    "it is concluded by mowlavi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) that the chances for a significant @xmath13 yield from agb stars are likely to increase with the stellar mass for a given metallicity , or to increase with decreasing metallicity for a given stellar mass .",
    "however , again , quantitative predictions of @xmath13 yields from agb stars are lacking due to the failure of modeling consistently the s - process in those stars .",
    "wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars are generally considered to be the normal evolutionary phase of very massive stars ( @xmath81 to 80 m@xmath36 , depending upon their initial composition ) .",
    "their structure , evolution and surface compositions are governed by huge non - explosive mass losses which can amount to as much as @xmath82 m@xmath36/y . as a result of these spectacular winds , products of central hydrogen and even of central he burning can appear at the stellar surface , and be ejected into the interstellar medium .",
    "apart from their role of strong interstellar medium chemical contamination , these winds have also a substantial dynamical effect of the wr surroundings .",
    "these stars are predicted to explode as snib / c ( see above ) .",
    "the reader is referred to e.g. arnould et al .",
    "( 1997a ) for a more detailed review of the observed properties of wr stars , as well as of some theoretical considerations .",
    "much progress has been made recently in the modeling of these stars .",
    "many important observed features , like their luminosities , surface chemical compositions , or statistics in regions of constant star formation rate , as well as in starburst locations , can now be nicely accounted for by single non - rotating model stars ( e.g. maeder 1991 , maeder & meynet 1994 ) . in spite of this success ,",
    "uncertainties of course remain in the models .",
    "however , it has to be stressed also that the impact on the predictions of these uncertainties is largely reduced under the constraint that the largest possible body of observed intrinsic wr properties have to be reproduced at best .",
    "this favorable situation , combined with the fact that the modeling of single non - rotating wr stars is _ immensely _ simpler than the one of all the other short - lived radionuclide producers proposed up to now ( and in particular of the agb stars ; see sect .",
    "3.3 ) , forces to conclude that _ the predicted wr yields are likely to reach a level of reliability that can not be obtained in the other cases_. of course , one has to remain alert to the fact that the wr structure and nucleosynthetic yield predictions might be affected by rotation , as well as by the binary nature of a non - negligible fraction of the wr stars .",
    "these effects are briefly discussed below .",
    "the production of short - lived radionuclides of cosmochemical interest has been calculated in the framework of detailed evolution models for a large variety of non - rotating wr stars with different initial masses and compositions , and with the use of extended nuclear reaction networks .",
    "we first briefly review the special case of @xmath11 before considering the yields of other radionuclides of relevance .",
    "a detailed discussion of the production of @xmath11 by the mgal chain of hydrogen burning developing in wr stars has been conducted recently by arnould et al .",
    "( 1997b ) and meynet et al .",
    "figure 3 displays some of their results in the form of the total mass @xmath83 of @xmath11 ejected by wr stars with various initial masses @xmath84 and metallicities @xmath85 .",
    "it shows that the @xmath11 yields increase with initial mass and @xmath85 , the @xmath85 dependence being approximated by @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the solar metallicity .",
    "it is worth noticing that the @xmath88al yields of meynet et al .",
    "( 1997 ) are in qualitative agreement with those of langer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , even if these two sets of models greatly differ in their physical ingredients .",
    "this illustrates the statement made above concerning the reduced impact of remaining uncertainties in the models once they are constrained by observation .",
    "1truecm    editor : figure 3 here    1truecm      rotation induces numerous dynamical instabilities in stellar interiors , and in particular meridional circulation and shear turbulence ( e.g. zahn 1992 ) .",
    "the related mixing of the chemical species can deeply modify the chemical structure of a star and its evolution , and may in particular have important consequences on the @xmath88al production by wr stars . at present , very few rotating wr models address this question in detail ( see langer et al .",
    "1995 for some preliminary results ) , so that it is certainly premature to quantitatively assess the possible role rotation plays in that respect .",
    "however , it seems safe to say that rotation increases the quantity of @xmath88al ejected by wr stellar winds .",
    "this claim is made plausible by fig .",
    "4 , which shows the structural evolution during their h- and he - burning phases of two 60 m@xmath36 stars that just differ by their rotational velocities .",
    "it appears that    \\1 ) the size of the convective core is enhanced by rotation ;    \\2 ) rapidly rotating stars may enter the wr phase while still on the main sequence",
    ". moreover the surface abundances characteristic of their wnl and wc phases are not due to the mass loss which uncovers core layers , but result from diffusive mixing in the radiative zones . as a consequence ,",
    "the evolution of the surface abundances are much smoother in rotating models ;    \\3 ) the wr lifetime increases with @xmath89 .",
    "in particular the wn stage during which @xmath88al is ejected , as well as the wn / wc transition phase , become much longer , so that much more mass is ejected during these phases .",
    "as a numerical example , the non - rotating model sketched in fig . 4 ejects about 5 m@xmath36 during the wn phase , while about 50 m@xmath36 is ejected by the rotating model during the same phase .",
    "1truecm    editor : figure 4 here    1truecm    the inference that rotation can enhance the @xmath11 yields of wr stars is confirmed by the numerical simulations of langer et al . ( 1995 ) ( see also the presupernovae evolution models for rotating massive stars computed by heger 1998 ) .",
    "rotation also lowers the minimum initial mass of single stars which can go through a wr stage with a concomitant ejection of @xmath11 .",
    "it is thus likely to increase the net amount of @xmath11 ejected by wr stars in the ism .",
    "this may be of relevance both to cosmochemistry and to @xmath14-ray line astrophysics ( sect .",
    "5 ) as well .      tidal interactions in close binary systems",
    "may considerably modify the evolution of the two stellar components with respect to the one they would experience as isolated stars .",
    "mass transfer by roche lobe overflow can act as a strong stellar wind , and thus reduce the critical initial mass for producing single wr stars . before any mass transfer",
    ", tidal effects are also expected to deform the star and therefore induce instabilities reminiscent of those induced by rotation . to our knowledge , the latter effect has never been studied in any detail , even if it might have important consequences , like the homogenization of the stars , and the related inhibition of mass transfer .",
    "other effects remain to be explored , like the impact of colliding winds on the mass transfer process , or even the very nature of the grains which can condense in colliding winds ( see sect .",
    "thus the effect of binarity on the wr star formation and evolution , and on the corresponding @xmath88al production can not be evaluated with confidence at this time . some preliminary estimates ( braun & langer 1995 ) lead to the conclusion that ` only for stars with masses @xmath90 40 m@xmath36 , binarity has the potential to increase the @xmath88al yield compared to the single star case ' ( see also langer et al .",
    "the fact that the situation may be quite different in more massive stars can be interpreted in the following way : after their main sequence , single high mass stars go through a lbv phase characterized by especially high stellar winds ( see fig .",
    "additional mass losses triggered by binarity would thus not induce more than a perturbation in the evolution of these stars .",
    "in contrast , lower initial mass stars not suffering the lbv winds would be drastically affected by roche lobe overflow mass transfer , which acts as a strong wind not operating if the corresponding stars were isolated .",
    "the extent in the reduction of the @xmath11 that can be ejected in the ism by @xmath91 m@xmath36 wr members of binary systems can not be assertained at this point .",
    "it has clearly to depend on the fraction of the mass lost by the wr star which is accreted by its companion , and thus withdrawn from the ism . in this scenario , however , one may wonder about the fate of the accreting companion , and about its net production or destruction of @xmath11 resulting from its evolution .",

    ", it is quite risky to try evaluating the plausibility of the blends of supernova layers that are called for in order to fit the observed anomalies .",
    "finally , evidence for the presence of @xmath53 ( @xmath54 y ) in some graphite and sic - x grains is provided by @xmath138 excesses that translate into @xmath138/@xmath136 ratios of up to about 140 times solar ( amari & zinner 1997 ) .",
    "this radionuclide is predicted to be produced in the so - called @xmath75-rich freeze - out developing in the layers of a snii located just outside the forming neutron star .",
    "the corresponding yields are thus extremely sensitive to the still uncertain details of the physics of the explosion .",
    "the isotopic anomalies that correlate with the @xmath138 excess are often considered to demonstrate a snii origin of the carrier grains ( nittler et al .",
    "1996 ) . again , a large mixing of ad hoc amounts of different sn layers has to be postulated , and the possibility of getting just the right mixing of course remains to be demonstrated .",
    "it has also been proposed ( clayton et al . 1997 ) that the correlated anomalies carried by the sic  -  x grains , including the @xmath53-related anomaly , present evidence for a snia origin .",
    "clearly , this model alleviates the mixing problem just mentioned , but raises other highly complex questions .",
    "in particular , and as acknowledged by clayton et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , the progenitors and the evolution to explosion of snia are far less well understood than in the snii case . in such conditions ,",
    "it is not known at this time if nature can really provide the conditions that would be required for producing sic - x grains with the right load of isotopic anomalies .",
    "clearly , a large variety of radionuclides are produced continuously in the present extraterrestrial solar system matter , as well as in terrestrial samples , by spallation reactions induced by galactic cosmic rays ( gcrs ) or by solar energetic particles ( seps ) ( e.g. michel 1998 ) .",
    "however , such a production can not account for the abundances of extinct radionuclides derived from the observed isotopic anomalies mentioned above , at least if the spallation processes have operated in the early solar system at a level commensurable with their present efficiency .",
    "the only hope for a local production to be viable is thus to call for an enhanced spallation production which could be associated with the increased sep production of the young sun , especially in its t - tauri phase .",
    "the plausibility of such an enhancement is supported by a variety of observations of ` young stellar objects ( ysos ) ' .",
    "jerry and one of the authors ( m.a . ) have revisited this question more than a decade ago ( wasserburg & arnould 1987 ) in an attempt to identify a possible relationship between the early solar activity and the extinct @xmath11 and @xmath61 in meteorites .",
    "this is just one in a series of investigations dealing with the spallation scenario , which has been the subject of a recent and renewed interest .",
    "one has to aknowledge that , in spite of some success , the various studies conducted along these lines reach the conclusion that it appears difficult to account for the production of all the relevant short - lived radionuclides in proportions compatible with the observations , at least without invoking a prohibitive number of ` tooth fairies ' ( e.g. podosek & nichols 1997 for references ; also lee et al .",
    "1998 and sahijpal et al . 1998 ) .",
    "it may be worth noting that wasserburg & arnould ( 1987 ) stress the possible interest , and identify some consequences , of envisioning spallation scenarios in which the ratio of @xmath75-particle to proton fluences would be higher than in the solar nebula .",
    "such a situation might be prevaling around h - depleted wr stars . in this scenario ,",
    "spallation and thermonuclear production of short - lived radionuclides might just be indissolubly complementary .",
    "it is our opinion that these speculations deserve further scrutiny .",
    "as reviewed in the previous sections , short- or ultra - short - lived radionuclides have left their signatures in solar system solids or meteoritic presolar grains in the form of excesses of their daughter products .",
    "they may also be identifiable in the present ism if their decay leads to a substantial feeding of a nuclear excited state of the daughter products .",
    "in such a situation , their electromagnetic de - excitation produces @xmath14-ray lines with specific energies , usually in the mev domain .",
    "gamma - ray astrophysics complements in a very important way the study of extinct radionuclides in meteorites .",
    "in particular , it provides information on the present - day production of these nuclides ; it also allows in some instances a direct identification of their nucleosynthetic sources , while the cosmochemical inferences are necessarily indirect .",
    "this complementarity has not escaped jerry s curiosity ( qian et al .",
    "1998 ) .    on the observational side ,",
    "@xmath14-ray line astronomy has received considerable momentum in the 80s with the detection of @xmath11 in the milky way .",
    "it has now been promoted to a mature astrophysical discipline following the discovery of additional lines from the @xmath139 @xmath140 @xmath141 @xmath140 @xmath73 disintegration chain in the supernovae sn1987a and sn1991 t , from the @xmath142 @xmath140 @xmath143 in sn1987a , and from @xmath53 @xmath140 @xmath144 @xmath140 @xmath138 in the casa and j052 - 4642 ( iyudin et al .",
    "1998 ) supernova remnants .",
    "these observations have been complemented with a substantial amount of theoretical effort in order not only to interpret the available data , but also to predict other potential @xmath14-ray line candidates . among them , @xmath51 and @xmath62 are of special interest ( see arnould & prantzos 1999 or diehl & timmes 1998 for recent reviews ) .",
    "the production of a radionuclide at a high enough level and its decay to an excited state of its daughter nucleus are necessary but not sufficient conditions for it to be an interesting candidate for @xmath14-ray astronomy .",
    "other factors indeed play a key role .",
    "this concerns in particular the decay lifetimes , which enter the problem through the fact that the production of the nuclei of interest takes place in environments initially opaque to @xmath14-rays ; these photons are thus degraded in energy as they interact with the surrounding material .",
    "the @xmath14-ray lines have in fact a significant probability to be detectable only if the matter densities , and thus the opacities , become low enough on timescales shorter than the radioactive decay lifetimes . these conditions can be met in agb or wr stars , which eject through extensive steady winds a substantial fraction of their relatively low - density outer material that can be enriched with certain @xmath14-ray line candidates ( see sect .  5.1 for a brief account of the @xmath11 production in relation with @xmath14-ray line observations ) .",
    "however , most radionuclides of interest are produced in explosive events of the nova or supernova types . in the latter case",
    ", the synthesis of the nuclides of relevance takes place in highly opaque deep layers , so that especially drastic constraints are put on the @xmath14-ray line observability .",
    "the situation is , in fact , quite different when dealing with snia explosions of low - mass stars , or with snii explosions of massive stars .",
    "the snia ejecta reach low opacites much more quickly than the snii ones in view of their lower masses ( about 1 @xmath94 ) and larger ejection velocities ( in excess of @xmath145 km / s ) .",
    "more specifically , the ejecta become transparent to @xmath14-ray photons typically after a few weeks in snia and only after about one year in the snii case .",
    "even if snia provide better detection conditions , they forbid in particular the observation of the @xmath14-ray line associated with the decay of the important nuclide @xmath139 , whose half - life is only 6 days .      not content with playing a very special role in cosmochemistry ,",
    "@xmath11 has also been responsible for the birth of @xmath14-ray line astrophysics with the observation in the present ism of the 1.8 mev @xmath14-ray line emitted following the de - excitation of the @xmath55 produced by the @xmath11 @xmath27-decay .",
    "the data available to - date indicate that the present ism contains about 2 m@xmath36 of @xmath11 , the distribution of which excludes ( i ) a unique point source in the galactic center , ( ii ) a strong contribution from the old stellar population of the galactic bulge , and ( iii ) any class of sources involving a large number of sites with low individual yields , like novae or low - mass agb stars .",
    "in contrast , they favor massive stars ( wr stars and/or snib / ic and snii ) as the @xmath11 production sites ( e.g. kndlseder et al .",
    "they suggest in fact that most of the @xmath11 is made by high metallicity wr stars in the inner galaxy .    the @xmath11 yields from non - rotating wr stars predicted as reviewed in sect .",
    "3.4 have been used to evaluate quantitatively the virtues of these stars as sources of the 1.8 mev line in the present ism .",
    "figure 6 shows the mass of live @xmath88al deposited by the winds of wr stars in rings of increasing galactocentric radius .",
    "this estimate is based on the metallicity dependent yields computed by meynet et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and on their assumptions concerning in particular the initial mass function , and the galactocentric radius dependence of the star formation rate and of the metallicity ( for details , see their sect .",
    "the signature of the @xmath146 kpc ring of molecular clouds located at the galactocentric radius of about 5 kpc is clearly seen .",
    "it is also predicted that more than half of the total @xmath11 mass is contained within this ring .",
    "the integration of the histogram of fig . 6 over the galactic radius leads to a total galactic mass of 1.15 m@xmath36 produced solely by non rotating non - exploding wr stars .",
    "due consideration of various uncertainties leads to masses in the probable 0.4 - 1.3 m@xmath36 range ( meynet et al .",
    "1997 ) , so that the considered stars might account for 20 to 70% of the present galactic @xmath11 .",
    "1truecm    editor : figure 6 here    1truecm    as already stressed in sect .",
    "3.4 , these results may have to be changed when rotation and/or binarity are taken into account .",
    "in fact , rotation increases the total contribution of wr stars to the galactic @xmath11 by lowering the minimum initial mass star of single stars which can go through a wr phase .",
    "it is not possible to be more quantitative on this point at present .",
    "a detailed evaluation of the global @xmath11 galactic input by rotating wr stars indeed requires the computation of a grid of models with different initial masses , metallicities and rotation rates , as well as the convolution of yields from individual stars with an observed distribution of rotational velocities .",
    "as far as binarity is concerned , preliminary computations suggest that it might increase the @xmath11 yields computed for single stars for wr initial masses lower than about 40 m@xmath36 , the reverse effect being obtained for more massive stars .",
    "clearly , this important question deserves further studies .",
    "this is even more the case following recent observations of the @xmath147 vel binary system .",
    "the presently available observations can not help disentangling the relative contributions of non - exploding wr stars , exploding ones ( snib / ic ) and snii to the present @xmath11 galactic content . in this respect ,",
    "a recent observation of high value provides an upper limit of about 10@xmath148 ph @xmath149s@xmath150 for the 1.8 mev luminosity of the @xmath147 vel binary system containing an o - type and a wr star ( of wc8 subtype , diehl et al .",
    "1999 ) . in order to evaluate the compatibility of this observation with predictions , at least the initial mass and metallicity of the wr progenitor , as well as the age of @xmath147 vel have to be known .",
    "the proximity of @xmath147 vel justifies the use of solar metallicity stellar models .",
    "non - rotating single star models ( meynet et al . 1994 ) , combined with the position of the o - star component in the hr diagram , lead to an age between 3.5 and 4.5 my , and an initial wr mass between 40 and 60 m@xmath36 ( schaerer et al . 1997 ) .",
    "a 60 m@xmath36 wr progenitor is predicted to have a 1.8 mev luminosity exceeding the observed upper limit by a factor of about 2 , while the calculated luminosity lies below this limit in the case of a 40 m@xmath36 model star . from these considerations",
    "alone , one can conclude that the observed upper limit is compatible with the predictions for @xmath151 m@xmath36 single , non - rotating and non - exploding wr stars .",
    "of course , @xmath147 vel is a binary system .",
    "as discussed above , a @xmath152 m@xmath36 wr component can not be excluded by the observation of diehl et al .",
    "( 1999 ) if indeed a large enough fraction of its @xmath11-loaded ejecta is accreted by its o - star companion .",
    "the decay of a variety of nuclides with half - lives ranging from some years to billions of years probably originating from outside the solar system are now recorded in live or fossil form in the solar system .",
    "these findings bring a rich variety of information about a vast diversity of highly interesting astrophysical questions , some of which are briefly reviewed here with special emphasis on the contribution of jerry wasserburg to this broadly interdisciplinary field of research .",
    "first , the virtues of the long - lived ( half - lives @xmath0 close to , or in excess of @xmath1 y ) radionuclides as galactic chronometers are discussed in the light of recent observational and theoretical works .",
    "it is concluded that the trans - actinide clocks based on the solar system abundances of @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 or on the @xmath2 surface content of some old stars are still unable to meaningfully complement galactic age estimates derived from other independent astrophysical methods . in this respect , there is reasonable hope that the @xmath5-@xmath6 chronometric pair could offer better prospects .",
    "the special case of @xmath7 , which is a pure s - process product , is also reviewed .",
    "it is generally considered today that this radionuclide can not be viewed as a reliable s - process chronometer .",
    "second , we comment on the astrophysical messages that could be brought by short - lived radionuclides ( @xmath8 y ) that have been present in live or in fossil form in the early solar system . from an astrophysical point of view ,",
    "the demonstrated early existence of live short - lived radionuclides is generally considered to provide the most sensitive radiometric probe concerning discrete nucleosynthetic events that presumably contaminated the solar system at times between about @xmath9 and @xmath10 y prior to the isolation of the solar material from the general galactic material .",
    "of course , this assumes implicitly that the radionuclides of interest have not been synthesized in the solar system itself .",
    "this is still a matter of debate , as we briefly stress .",
    "if indeed the short - lived radionuclides that have been present live in the early solar system are not of local origin , the external contaminating agents that have been envisioned are supernovae , evolved stars of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) type , or massive mass - losing stars of the wolf - rayet ( wr ) type .",
    "we comment especially on some aspects of the agb or wr contamination . in the latter case , we discuss more specifically the role of rotation and of binarity on the predicted yields of @xmath11 , a radionuclide of special cosmochemistry and astrophysics interest . some comments are also devoted to @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the former one is a short - lived p - process radionuclide that has most probably been in live form in the solar system , while the latter one is of s - process origin .",
    "it is shown to raise interesting nuclear physics and astrophysics questions , and to deserve further cosmochemical studies in order to evaluate its probability of existence in live form in the early solar system .",
    "finally , a brief mention is made to @xmath14-ray line astrophysics , which provides interesting information on live short - lived radionuclides in the present interstellar medium , and thus complements in a very important way the study of extinct radionuclides in meteorites .",
    "this is illustrated with the case of @xmath11 .",
    "jerry wasserburg has written important pages of many chapters of this ` astrophysics of cosmic radioactivities ' with his incomparable dynamism and competence .",
    "he has without doubt triggered much work in the field and shown many new ways .",
    "for sure , it must be most gratifying for him to know that so much remains to be done and said , and that each day brings its share of renewed excitement and laboratory discoveries .",
