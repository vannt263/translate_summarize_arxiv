    "the character of the superconducting ( sc ) pairing in heavy - fermion ( hf ) compounds has remained a central open question , fitting in the broader puzzle of what mechanism drives unconventional superconductivity in general .",
    "the prevalent picture suggests that , in most cases ( e.g. various cuprates @xcite , iron - pnictides , organics @xcite , and hfs @xcite ) , spin fluctuations ( sfs ) associated with the proximity to an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point ( qcp ) provide the glue for the sc condensate . however , whether this magnetic mechanism is ubiquitous among unconventional scs or some other mechanism could be playing an important role as well - like valence fluctuations ( vfs ) @xcite or even _ composite _ pairing @xcite- is yet to be resolved .",
    "one family of materials where this question is relevant is that of the heavy - fermion pu-115 scs , pu@xmath3 ( @xmath4=co , rh , and @xmath5=ga , in ) .",
    "the electronic properties of these materials are chiefly governed by the pu 5@xmath1 electrons @xcite , which display a complex duality between itinerant and localized atomic - like behavior , leading to a variety of exotic highly correlated states , not the least of which is unconventional superconductivity .",
    "becomes sc below @xcite , the highest critical temperature amongst heavy - fermion scs and nearly an order of magnitude higher than the other pu-115 family members :  ( ) @xcite ,  ( ) @xcite , and  ( ) @xcite .",
    "there have been several attempts to draw a connection between the variation of @xmath6 and other physical quantities , such as a linear correlation to the lattice tetragonality @xmath7 @xcite or the spin - fluctuation energy anisotropy @xcite , in an effort to delineate a common sc mechanism .",
    "alternatively , one could hypothesize that the considerably higher  of  is not simply a manifestation of a larger sc pairing energy scale , but rather the consequence of an entirely different pairing mechanism .",
    "one such plausible scenario for the pu-115s would accommodate two distinctive sc domes in a potential @xmath8 phase diagram @xcite : one for the larger unit - cell volume ( i.e. , smaller effective chemical pressure ) in compounds where sc is magnetically - mediated , near to an antiferromagnetic qcp ; and another one , at higher effective chemical pressure , where  resides and where vfs help stabilize superconductivity proximate to a valence transition , similar to the case of cecu@xmath9si@xmath9 under pressure @xcite . further support for the latter scenario , at least intuitively , is the absence of a local magnetic moment in the normal state of , i.e. , it exhibits an approximately temperature - independent pauli susceptibility @xcite , as well as the fact that it does not appear to be near a magnetically ordered state @xcite .",
    "importantly , recent ultrasound spectroscopy measurements in  revealed an anomalous softening of the bulk modulus over a wide temperature range in the normal state , which is truncated upon entering the sc state @xcite .",
    "the effect was attributed to strong fluctuations of the pu 5@xmath1 mixed - valence state , which in turn drive the sc pairing thus avoiding a valence transition .",
    "nevertheless , nuclear quadrupole and magnetic resonance ( nqr and nmr , respectively ) experiments have long provided evidence for the presence of strong antiferromagnetic sfs in the normal state of  and approaching  @xcite , a hallmark of magnetically - mediated superconductivity .",
    "hence , albeit challenging , probing directly for signatures of valence fluctuations and their relationship to any sfs could inform the conundrum of the sc pairing s detailed character in the pu 115s .    here , we report an extended , comprehensive nqr study in  of both crystallographic ga sites of the naturally abundant @xmath10ga and @xmath11ga , focusing on the temperature dependence of the electric field gradient ( efg ) and the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate ( ) in the normal state .",

    "second , if the nqr relaxation mechanism were dominated by charge fluctuations , this should be reflected on the ratio of the rates of the two ga isotopes : the relaxation is generally governed solely by magnetic fluctuations , in which case the rates of different isotopes scale with the square of the respective gyromagnetic ratio ( see eq . [ eq : moriya ] ) . for ga nuclei , it is @xmath93 .",

    ", one could envision a scenario where spin and charge degrees of freedom are intricately coupled due to the strong hybridization , with the relevant strong 2d fluctuations being manifested differently in the two probes while being central to the formation of the sc condensate .",
    "such a picture for the normal - state fluctuations in  would resemble , for example , the case of @xmath98-pu where the mixed - valence 5@xmath1 states @xcite are accompanied by well - defined spin fluctuations , as was recently revealed by inelastic neutron scattering @xcite .",
