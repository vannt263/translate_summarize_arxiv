    "the discovery that the universe is currently undergoing a period of accelerating expansion , obtained from the observations of type ia supernovae @xcite , inaugurate an exciting era of intense theoretical research .",
    "a variety of possible solutions to understand the mechanism driving this accelerating expansion have been debated during this decade including the cosmological constant , exotic matter and energy , modified gravity , anthropic arguments , etc .",
    "the most favored ones are dark energy based models and modified gravity theories such @xmath2 gravity @xcite , and dvali - gabadadze - porrati model of gravity @xcite with an equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the energy density and pressure of the cosmic fluid , respectively ) .",
    "the dark energy is frequently modeled as an homogeneous scalar field , and according to the value of the eos parameter @xmath6 , three different cases can be distinguished : _ quintessence scalar fields _ ( @xmath7 ) with a positive kinetic term ; _ cosmological constant _ ( @xmath8 ) , where only the potential term contributes to both the pressure and the energy density of the field ; finally , scalar fields with a negative kinetic term dubbed _ phantom fields _ ( @xmath9 ) . in the latter case",
    "the universe will suffer a crucial fate where the energy density and the scale factor diverge in finite time , ripping apart all bound systems of the universe , before the universe approaches the so - called big - rip singularity @xcite .",
    "it is also well known that in phantom fluid models with big rip singularity , quantum gravity effects become dominant in the neighboring of the big rip time @xcite . however",
    ", even phantom fluid based models suffer from quantum instabilities @xcite and violation of the strong and dominant classical energy conditions @xcite , the phantom fluids are favored by the cosmic microwave background experiments combined with large scale structure data , the hubble parameter measurement and luminosity measurements of type ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "an other important and growing field currently under investigation is related to the thermodynamic properties of an expanding universe @xcite .",
    "recent studies on phantom thermodynamics show that the entropy of the universe is negative @xcite , while the generalized second law of gravitational thermodynamics ( gsl ) is satisfied , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the phantom fluid entropy and @xmath12 is the entropy of the cosmological horizon @xcite .",
    "an other point under debate is the influence of a non - zero chemical potential on the phantom thermodynamics and its relation with the gsl @xcite .    in this paper the thermodynamic properties of black holes immersed in",
    "dark energy - dominated expanding universe and the accretion process of phantom energy onto black holes are investigated .",
    "the first paper dealing with the later process is due to babishev et al @xcite , where ignoring the backreaction effect of the phantom fluid on the black hole , they found that the change rate of the black hole mass is negative .",
    "however , in recent scenarios where the backreaction is taken into account @xcite , it is found that the mass of the black hole is always an increasing function in an expanding friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in section 2 we review the exact solution recently obtained in @xcite , and describing a black hole embedded in an expanding frw universe . in section 3",
    ", we examine the hawking radiation at the apparent horizon , and compare with magnitude of the phantom energy accretion process .",
    "we will show that the former is highly suppressed , particularly at late times . in section 4 , we study in an unified and general way the thermodynamics of cosmological black hole embedded in an expanding ( frw ) universe with a general eos parameter @xmath13 , and particularly we obtain solutions realizing the crossing of the phantom divide line . in section 5 , the stability of the solutions of section 4 under the quantum correction due to the conformal anomaly is established . in section 6 ,",
    "we study the conditions required for the validity of the gsl when the black hole is immersed in phantom energy - dominated frw universe .",
    "particularly , in order to protect the gsl , we obtain a critical mass of the black hole of the order of the solar mass for particular values of the parameter @xmath14 where @xmath15 are the present day values of the chemical potential , the particle density and the energy density , respectively .",
    "finally , we discuss and summarize our results in section 7 .",
    "the first solution of einstein s theory of general relativity describing a black hole like object embedded in an expanding universe was introduced by mcvittie in 1933 @xcite , and is given in isotropic coordinates by    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the scale factor and @xmath18 is the mass of the black hole in the static case .",
    "in fact , when @xmath19 it reduces to the schwarzschild solution .",
    "when the mass parameter is zero , the mcvittie reduces to a spatially flat frw solution with the scale factor @xmath17 .",
    "the global structure of ( [ eq : mcvittie ] ) has been studied and particularly it has been shown that the solution possesses a spacelike singularity on the 2-sphere @xmath20 and can not describe an embedded black hole in an expanding spatially flat flrw universe @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the mcvittie solution is constrained by the non - accretion condition onto the central mass , and therefore is not suitable for a study of cosmic fluid accretion process onto black holes embedded in an expanding frw universe .    in the following we adopt the new solution describing a black hole embedded in a spatially flat frw universe@xcite    @xmath21    where @xmath22",
    ", @xmath17 is the scale factor and @xmath18 is the mass of the black hole in the static case . in fact , when @xmath19 the solution ( [ eq : metric01 ] ) reduces to the schwarzschild solution , while when the mass parameter is zero , it reduces to a spatially flat frw solution with the scale factor @xmath17 .",
    "using the areal radius @xmath23 the metric takes the following suitable painlev-gullstrand form    ds^2= & -dt^2+(1-)^-1dr^2[eq : metric02 ] + & -2rh(1-)^-1dtdr+r^2d^2 ,    where @xmath24 is the hubble parameter and over dot stands for derivative with respect to the cosmic time .",
    "the term @xmath25 plays the role of variable cosmological constant .",

    "the apparent horizons ( ah ) are solutions of @xmath34 which leads to    @xmath35    where we introduced the",
    "hawking - hayward quasi - local mass @xmath36 a remarkable feature of this quantity is that it is coordinate - independent , and consequently is recognized as the physically relevant mass of the black hole .",
    "obviously , it is always increasing in an expanding universe @xcite .",
    "therefore , the calculation of the change rate of the black hole mass will lead to opposite conclusions to that of babishev et al .",
    "@xcite .    discarding the unphysical branch with the lower sign in [ eq : ahequation ] ,",
    "the ah are given by    r_b= & ( 1-),r_c=(1+),[eq : ahb ]    where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the cosmological and the black hole ah , respectively .",
    "note that the ah coincide at a time @xmath39 defined by @xmath40 this coincidence takes place in a future or past universe depending on the kind of fluid accretion onto the black hole .",
    "let us now consider that the fluid is described by a imperfect fluid with the stress - energy tensor given by    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the fluid four velocity and @xmath43 is a spatial vector field describing the radial energy current .",
    "written in terms of the comoving ah , the solutions of the einstein equations of motion are @xcite ,    h= & r_a,3h+=-8gr_ap.[eq : e3 ]    assuming a radial heat inflow ( @xmath44 ) , the change rate of the black hole mass is then@xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "this relation shows that the hawking - hayward quasi - local mass is always increasing .",
    "for the apparent horizon to exist in an expanding universe we have the following condition    @xmath47    this condition requires us to consider massive objects for which @xmath48 is a small quantity . using the present day value of the hubble parameter",
    ", we estimate the critical bh mass as @xmath49 .",
    "this is the condition for which the engulfing of the universe by the bh is prevented @xcite . using the areal radius @xmath50 , and solving for @xmath51",
    ", we obtain one physical solution given by@xmath52 for the solution to be real , we have to impose the condition@xmath53 which is true only in an expanding universe due to the relation @xmath54 .",
    "we note that the equality sign has been discarded in ( [ eq : gmh ] ) , since it leads to @xmath55 , which does not hold for @xmath56 the relation ( [ eq : gmh ] ) means that we are dealing with systems which are small compared to the cosmological curvature , and that distances below @xmath57 are naturally excluded .",
    "assuming now the eos , @xmath58 and substituting ( [ eq : gmh ] ) in friedmann equations , one finds the following upper bounds on the densities    @xmath59    therefore , in case of phantom energy driven expansion , the finite increase of densities with time , will avoid the big rip singularity . on the other , since the bh mass increases with time , the upper bounds ( [ eq : energy - pressure ] ) , become very small . as an estimate of the energy density we have @xmath60 for the smallest super - massive bh detected in the dwarf seyfert 1 galaxy pox 52 with @xmath61 @xcite . on the other hand if @xmath62 , we have @xmath63 even if we take @xmath64 of the order of the planck mass we have @xmath65    we now consider the hawking radiation from the cosmological ah . the temperature on",
    "the ah is defined by @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the surface gravity . in dynamical spacetime",
    "there is no timelike killing vector , and the usual definition of the surface gravity may be modified . in this case case",
    "the surface gravity is related to the so called trapping horizon . here",
    "we follow the work of s. a. hayward @xcite , where the surface gravity is defined by @xmath68}=\\kappa k_{a}$ ] , @xmath69 , with @xmath70 the kodama vector corresponding to the background given by eq.([eq : metric02 ] ) . evaluating all the quantities on the trapping horizon , we get the simplified form , @xmath71 , where the metric @xmath72 is defined by @xmath73 . performing the calculation",
    ", one finally finds@xmath74 writing @xmath64 is terms of the ah , the temperature at the ah becomes    @xmath75    expanding ( [ eq : temperature-1 ] ) to first order in @xmath76 at the black hole ah and cosmic ah , we obtain @xmath77 @xmath78 respectively . using ( [ eq : gmh ] ) in the first factor , along with @xmath79 in the second factor , and @xmath80 , one obtains an instantaneous upper bound for temperature at cosmic ah@xmath81 the relation ( [ eq : tcapprox ] ) shows that the accretion process tends to lower the hawking temperature at the cosmic ah .",
    "we note that in ( [ eq : tbapprox ] ) we have not used the absolute value , as a consequence of the equivalence principle @xcite .",
    "a similar behavior is also observed if one anticipates and use the scale factor ( [ eq : scalefactor ] ) derived in section 4 , for a phantom dominated era .",
    "in fact , one can see an unusual behavior of the temperature when approaching the time @xmath82 as it is shown in fig .",
    "1 , the temperature at the cosmic ah increases with time , reaches a maximum , then begins to decrease , and stops at the end time @xmath39 .",
    "this means that the hawking radiation at the cosmological ah will decrease rapidly in favor of a hugh increasing of the accretion of phantom fluid . on the hand ,",
    "the temperature of the black hole ah starts to fall at early stage because of the increasing of the black hole mass by accretion of phantom energy , and at late stage begins incraesing .",
    "however , the latter strange behavior is mainly due to the absolute value in the definition of temperature .",
    "an independent derivation of ( [ eq : energy - pressure ] ) and ( [ eq : tmax ] ) can be performed by using the following simple arguments .",
    "imposing positivity of the @xmath83 component of the metric , and replacing the quasi - local mass by a density energy we have , @xmath84 .",
    "hence , @xmath85@xmath86 . using @xmath87",
    "one obtains @xmath88 , which is consistent with ( [ eq : energy - pressure ] ) . if one uses the stefan - boltzmann law @xmath89 and the quantum mechanical relation @xmath90 @xcite , one finds @xmath91 which of the same order of magnitude as ( [ eq : tmax ] ) for @xmath92 finally , we point that the extremal case corresponding to @xmath93 never occurs , since in this case we must have @xmath94 which contradicts the condition @xmath95        figure 1 : variation of temperature associated with the black hole and cosmic ah with time for @xmath96 .",
    "now , neglecting the accretion of radiation in phantom energy dominated era , and taking into account only the semi - classical hawking evaporation and the phantom energy accretion term , the differential equation for the black hole mass reads @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the stefan - boltzmann constant for massless fields with effective degree of freedom @xmath99 substituting the hawking temperature associated with the bh apparent horizon , we obtain @xmath100 this is a complicated relation for @xmath64 , whose behavior is shown in fig .",
    "since the two terms are in competition , there exist a transition time , the _ phantom time _ , after which the accretion process dominates and the bh mass increases .",
    "consequently , the bh does not lose but gain mass due to hugh accretion of dark energy .",
    "indeed , it easy to show that the maximal rate gain mass for @xmath101 is @xmath102 it is important to note that the accretion term becomes predominant at earlier times for massive bh .",
    "next , we perform the same analysis on the variation of the mass inside the cosmic ah .",
    "let us define the ratio between the radiation and the accretion term @xmath103 substituting ( [ eq : temperature-1 ] ) , and repeating the procedure leading to ( [ eq : tmax ] ) , one finds@xmath104 this result clearly shows that the hawking radiation at the cosmic ah is insignificant , even near the planck scale .",
    "figure 2 : variation of total mass associated with the black hole ah ( left panel ) and cosmic ah ( right panel ) with time .",
    "finally , let us point an other crucial feature of the model of dynamical black hole considered in this paper .",
    "if the expansion of the universe is driven by phantom fluid , the black hole ah expands while the cosmic ah shrinks as the universe expand until they meet at @xmath105 at time @xmath39 solution of ( [ eq : hcond ] ) . at times",
    "@xmath106 both the ah disappear living a proper singularity , well before the big - rip singularity is reached .",
    "the question if this singularity is naked or located inside the ah , and its connection with the violation of the cosmic censorship conjecture ( cch ) , is still under debates @xcite . to avoid discussing this topics , which are out of the scope of the present paper , and the fact that the phantom driven expansion of the universe is non singular , and that the radiation power can be neglected in comparison to the accretion of phantom fluid onto the bh , particularly at later stage , we limit the analysis in the remaining sections to the interval @xmath107 , far from the big rip singularity , and then purely classical treatment will be considered .",
    "we now consider the thermodynamics properties of the solution described in section 2 , with a variable eos parameter , @xmath108 . the particle fluid and entropy",
    "fluid currents , @xmath109 and @xmath110 are given by    @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are the densities of particle number and entropy , respectively .",
    "the conservations laws , @xmath114 @xmath115 and @xmath116 computed on the background given by ( [ eq : metric01 ] ) , give the following set of differential equations    @xmath117    @xmath118    @xmath119    the solutions of the above equations are    @xmath120\\left[\\frac{a_{0}^{\\frac{3}{2}\\left(1+w_{0}\\right)}}{a^{\\frac{3}{2}\\left(1+w\\left(a\\right)\\right)}}\\right]\\exp\\left[\\frac{3}{2}\\int_{a_{0}}^{a}daw'\\left(a\\right)\\ln a\\right],\\label{eq : rho}\\ ] ]    @xmath121,\\label{eq : n}\\ ] ]    @xmath122,\\label{eq : s}\\ ] ]    where the prime stands for derivative with respect to the scale factor , and @xmath123 @xmath124 , @xmath125 are the present day values of the corresponding quantities assumed to be positive definite . here",

    "then , imposing the positiveness of the rhs of eq.([eq : gsl ] ) and assuming the positiveness of the entropy , we have one solution given by    @xmath225    which is satisfied for an eos parameter in the range @xmath226 using the expression of @xmath125 given in ( [ eq : s0 ] ) and defining @xmath14 an immediate consequence of the positiveness of the entropy is that @xmath227 since @xmath228 , we get a lower bound estimate to the present day value of the chemical potential , @xmath229 which show that the chemical potential in phantom energy dominated - era is strictly negative .",
    "now , with @xmath230 and the present day parameters , we obtain the following bound on the entropy@xmath231 or in terms of @xmath232 and using ( [ eq : b - alpha ] ) , we have@xmath233 now , if we take @xmath234 gev we have @xmath235 here we would like to point that the bounds on the present day values of the entropy and the parameter @xmath232 are of the same order of that obtained by lima et al . @xcite . however , the calculation in this paper is performed by ignoring the back - reaction of the phantom fluid on the black hole .",
    "in fact , they used the schwarzschild metric , which can not describe the properties of black holes embedded in an expanding frw universe . as we explicitly show , taking into account the back - reaction effect , even in a low density background , leads to a drastic constraint on the eos parameter and rule out the approach based on zero chemical potential @xcite .",
    "now , using the obvious relation @xmath236 we obtain the quasi - local black hole mass above which the accretion of phantom fluid onto the black hole is permitted@xmath237.\\ ] ] using the constraint on the gsl ( [ eq : phantom ] ) , we obtain@xmath238.\\ ] ] in terms of @xmath232 and the present day quantities , the critical quasi - local mass is then@xmath239\\frac{m_{\\odot}}{t_{0}}.\\ ] ] for large values of @xmath240 and @xmath241 gev , the critical quasi - local mass is approximately @xmath242 this is a huge value , allowing all black holes in the universe to accrete phantom fluid .",
    "we note that in section 3 , we have shown that @xmath243 is the maximal allowed mass which prevents the engulfing of the universe by the bh . on the other hand small values of @xmath232 give critical bh mass of the order of the solar mass .",
    "for instance , taking @xmath244 , @xmath230 and @xmath241 gev , we obtain @xmath245 our results are similar to that obtained in @xcite , where the eos parameter is restricted to values less than @xmath246 and the back - reaction effect ignored . we have plotted the present day critical quasi - local mass with respect to @xmath6 for different values of the parameter @xmath247 obviously , the value of the parameter @xmath232 is very important in determining a critical quasi - local mass of the order of the solar mass .",
    "finally , if we set the chemical potential to zero , the critical mass reduces to @xmath248 which is negative for @xmath1 this result is expected from the relation ( [ eq : b - alpha ] ) .",
    "figure 3 : variation of the critical hawking - hayward quasi - local mass with respect to @xmath6 for different values of the parameter @xmath247",
    "in summary , we have investigated the thermodynamical properties of black holes immersed in an expanding spatially flat frw universe , for general eos parameter @xmath13 .",
    "particularly , we found that the temperature of the dark fluid is always positive regardless the value of the time varying eos parameter , and that the instantaneous vacuum state is characterized by non - zero temperature , entropy and chemical potential , respectively .",
    "an other important result is that all the thermodynamics parameters are regular at the phantom divide crossing .",
    "we have also analyzed the accretion process of phantom fluid onto black holes with small hawking - hayward quasi - local mass , and the constraints on the validity of the gsl .",
    "particularly , assuming the positiveness of the phantom fluid entropy , we have shown that phantom fluid may have a negative definite chemical potential in order to satisfy the gsl .",
    "we have also obtained , for an eos parameter within the interval @xmath249 a critical quasi - local mass of the black hole , above which the gsl is always protected . the present analysis ,",
    "show that taking into account the back - reaction effect of the phantom fluid on the black hole , even in a low density background , leads naturally to positive temperature and negative chemical potential , and may contributes to resolve the controversy on the subject @xcite .",
