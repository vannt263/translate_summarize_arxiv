    "optical emission lines from h  ii regions have long been the primary means of gas - phase chemical diagnostics in galaxies ( aller 1942 ; searle 1971 ; reviews by peimbert 1975 ; pagel 1986 ; shields 1990 ; aller 1990 ; peimbert , rayo , & torres - peimbert 1975 ; osterbrock 1989 ; de robertis 1987 ) .",
    "osterbrock ( 1989 ) thoroughly discusses the standard techniques for measuring the chemical properties of ionized gas , which require measurements of h and he recombination lines along with collisionally excited lines from one or more ionization states of heavy element species .",
    "oxygen is the most commonly used metallicity indicator in the interstellar medium ( ism ) by virtue of its relatively high abundance and strong emission lines in the optical region of the spectrum ( e.g. , [ o  ii]@xmath10 3727 and [ o  iii]@xmath10@xmath114959 , 5007 ) .",
    "ideally , the oxygen abundance is measured directly from ionic abundances obtained through a determination of the electron temperature ( @xmath12 ) of the h  ii region .",
    "this is known as the @xmath13method `` ( pagel et al . 1992 ; skillman & kennicutt 1993 ) .",

    ". however , [ o  iii]@xmath104363 is only prominent in metal - poor h  ii regions . in most cases , where [ o  iii]@xmath104363 is too weak to be detected , metallicities of h  ii regions have to be estimated from strong - line '' ratios .",

    "some calibrations have attempted to take the ionization parameters into account ( e.g. , mcgaugh 1991 ; kd02 etc . ) , but others have not .",
    "however , one problem is that the relationship between @xmath15 and 12+log(o / h ) is double valued , with the transition between the upper metal - rich branch and the lower metal - poor branch occurring near 12+log(o / h)@xmath178.4 ( log@xmath15@xmath180.8 ) .",
    "moreover , in many cases @xmath15 is unavailable due to the limit of wavelength coverage or the poor quality around one or some of the related lines .",
    "one can then use other various metallicity - sensitive strong - line ratios to estimate metallicities of galaxies , including [ n  ii]@xmath106583/h@xmath19 , [ o  iii]@xmath115007/[n  ii]@xmath206583 , [ n  ii]@xmath116583/[o  ii]@xmath103727 , [ n  ii]@xmath116583/[s  ii]@xmath10@xmath106717,6731 , [ s  ii]@xmath10@xmath106717,6731/h@xmath19 , and [ o  iii]@xmath10@xmath104959,5007/h@xmath21 . even when @xmath15 is available , these ratios are also useful for breaking the @xmath15 upper / lower branch degeneracy .",
    "we should notice that some of these strong - line ratios are also sensitive to interstellar reddening ( e.g. n  ii]/[o  ii ] ) or depend on the ionization parameter .",
    "some researchers have used @xmath22-based abundance data to calibrate for some of these strong - line ratios , for example , denicol ' o et al .",

    "prez - montero & daz ( 2005 ) also studied some calibrations from the collected 367 emission - line objects on the basis of the @xmath22-based oxygen abundances , but they did not derive analytic calibrating relations .",
    "however , these observations are limited to modest samples , and only apply to some of the strong - line ratios . the much larger consistent data set ( several tens of thousands ) from the recently released sdss database could provide much more information about many of the strong - line ratio calibrations for metallicities of galaxies .",
    "kd02 used a combination of stellar population synthesis and photoionization models to calibrate several strong - line abundance diagnostics . in the kd02 models ,",
    "strong line ratios are a function of both metallicity and ionization parameter .",
    "the ionization parameter , @xmath3 , is a measure of the number of ionizing photons per atom at the inner boundary of the nebula . to determine both metallicity and ionization parameter , kd02 suggested a somewhat complicated iterative approach involving a number of line ratios .",
    "we advocate a simpler approach in this study . in sect.4",
    "we compare the observed line ratios of a large sample of star - forming galaxies selected from the sdss - dr2 to the predictions of the kd02 models and show that galaxies span a smaller range of @xmath3 than used by kd02 .",
    "we therefore ignore any explicit dependence of the line ratios on @xmath3 , and use observational data to derive strong - line abundance calibrations which reflect the mean ionization parameter of the data at a given metallicity .",
    "the sdss - dr2 database is very well suited for this kind of study .",
    "there are a large number of galaxies at any given value of oxygen abundance between about 8.4 and 9.3 , which makes it ideal for measuring correlations between metallicity and various strong - line ratios and for quantifying the scatter .",
    "we make use of the emission line data and metallicities described in brinchmann et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and tremonti et al .",
    "( 2004 ) which have been made publicly available on the web .",
    "the oxygen abundances presented in tremonti et al .",
    "( 2004 ) were derived using bayesian techniques to compare multiple strong emission lines to a grid of photoionization models ( charlot et al .",
    "we use the @xmath15 metallicity calibration of tremonti et al . to derive a fiducial oxygen abundance .",
    "we then examine correlations between the oxygen abundances and the observed several strong emission - line ratios : [ n  ii]/h@xmath19 , [ o  iii]/[n  ii ] , [ n  ii]/[o  ii ] , [ n  ii ] /[s  ii ] , [ s  ii]/h@xmath19 , and [ o  iii]/h@xmath1 , then derive new strong - line metallicity calibrations where appropriate .",
    "our approach differs from the usual way in which abundance indicators are calibrated : 1 ) using samples of galaxies with direct ( @xmath22-based ) abundances ( e.g. pagel et al . 1979 ; pettini & pagel 2004 ) ; 2 ) using photoionization model grids ( e.g. mcgaugh 1991 ; charlot & longhetti 2001 ; kd02 ) .",
    "our calibrations are valid for high metallicity ( 12+log(o / h ) @xmath23 8.4 ) galaxies , where the @xmath22-based abundances are only available for a handful of objects ( bresolin et al .",

    "this will be the first such large sample for the observed log(n / o ) abundances , and will be useful for understanding the primary `` or secondary '' origin of nitrogen .",
    "specially , the strength of the sdss dataset is that there are a large number of galaxies at any given value of oxygen abundance between about 8.4 and 9.3 .",

    "our sdss sample galaxies show a similar discrepancy from the model : at the intermediate abundance 12+log(o",
    "/ h)@xmath29.0 , the model predicts too low n / o at a given o / h ; for the 12+log(o / h)@xmath239.0 , although the model predicts an increasing trend of n / o following o / h , the predicted n / o is still generally lower than the observed results at a given o / h .",
    "indeed , henry et al .",
    "( 2000 ) themselves already pointed out that their model b provides a fit to the no envelope compared with the observational data ( see their fig.3b ) .",
    "in addition , dust extinction is a very important factor affecting the estimated ( n / o ) abundances , as well as the o / h abundances .",
    "it can be understood from fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( by comparing with fig .",
    "[ fig4]c ) .",
    "the dust extinction of these sdss sample galaxies has been considered when deriving their abundances .",
    "moreover , it is a homogeneous sample taken from one single facility using the same set - up , which minimizes the systematic errors from observation runs , and the [ n  ii]/[o  ii ] ratio is almost independent of the ionization parameter ( kd02 ) .",
    "therefore , these sdss data points would not show much spread in the n / o vs o / h relations due to observational errors .",
    "the observational scatter of these galaxies are about 0.062dex estimated from fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] .",
    "the scatter in the observed log(n / o ) vs. log(o / h ) relation is relatively small .",
    "nevertheless , we can use our large dataset to see if the residuals correlate with any physical properties of galaxies .",
    "if the release of nitrogen is indeed delayed with respect to oxygen , we might expect to find a correlation between the n / o residuals and the stellar birthrate , which is the ratio of the present to past average star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "the equivalent widths of h@xmath19 emission lines , log(ew(h@xmath19 ) ) , provides a good proxy for the stellar birthrate ( kennicutt et al .",
    "[ fig9 ] shows the relation between log(n / o)@xmath115 and the log(ew(h@xmath19 ) ) for the sample galaxies .",
    "log(n / o)@xmath115 is the n / o abundance having its dependence on o / h abundances been removed .",
    "to do so , first we obtain a linear least squares fit for the relation between log(n / o ) vs. 12+log(o / h)@xmath67 for the sample galaxies , then the observed log(n / o ) abundances were subtracted by the fitted values predicted by this linear relation . fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] shows that the log(n / o ) abundances decrease following the increasing ews(h@xmath19 ) for these galaxies .",
    "the solid line refers to a linear least squares fit for this observed relation with a rms @xmath170.057 : @xmath116 this relation means that the log(n / o ) increases following the decreasing star formation rates , which is consistent with the suggestion of van zee & haynes ( 2006 ) for the relation between log(n / o ) and b - v colors for their dwarf galaxies .",
    "they suggested that the high n / o ratio are correlated with redder systems and decreasing star formation rates .",
    "we have use the observational data of a large sample of 38,478 star - forming galaxies selected from sdss - dr2 to derive oxygen abundance calibrations of 12+log(o / h ) versus several metallicity - sensitive emission - line ratios , including [ n  ii]/h@xmath19 , [ o  iii]/[n  ii ] , [ n  ii]/[o  ii ] , [ n  ii]/[s  ii ] , [ s  ii]/h@xmath19 , and [ o  iii]/h@xmath21 .",
    "these calibrations are very useful when the @xmath12-method `` , the most accurate method , and the empirical @xmath15-method '' are not available to estimate oxygen abundances of galaxies . in addition , they can overcome the double - valued \" drawback of the @xmath15-method .",
    "we fit the observed relations with a linear least squares fit and/or a third - order polynomial fit .",
    "all the fitting coefficients and the rms derivations ( 0.032 - 0.078dex ) have been given in table1 .",
    "when we only select the sample galaxies with higher signal - to - noise ratio emission lines , e.g. @xmath2310@xmath31 , the rms derivations only have small changes , which means that probably most of the scatter is intrinsic and not an artifact of observational errors .",
    "the scattering of the data points mainly come from the different ionization parameters in the individual galaxies , which is confirmed by the smallest rms value of [ n  ii]/[o  ii ] ratio , which is independent on the ionization parameters .",
    "such a large sample of galaxies can show some information never before obtained from much smaller samples , for example , the turnover of the relations between 12+log(o / h ) versus [ n  ii]/h@xmath19 at 12+log(o / h)@xmath239.0 .    among these calibrations , the [ n  ii]/[o  ii ] ratio should be the best one for metallicity calibration in the metal - rich branch ( same as kd02 ) because it shows a monotonical increase following the increasing metallicity and less scatter than other line ratios , and it is independent of the ionization parameter .",
    "however , dust extinction must be estimated properly before using this calibration indicator because of the blue line [ o  ii ] and the far positions of the two lines in wavelength .",
    "( [ o  iii]/h@xmath21)/([n  ii]/h@xmath19 ) is also a good indicator , a bit better than [ n  ii]/[s  ii ] and [ o  iii]/h@xmath21 due to the relatively smaller rms derivation . the discrepancy between the data and models for [ n  ii]/[s  ii ] highlights the need for empirical calibrations .",
    "[ n  ii]/h@xmath19 is only a good indicator for the galaxies with 12+log(o / h)@xmath29.0 , and the problem at higher metallicities is the turnover of [ n  ii]/h@xmath19 following increasing o / h .",
    "however , [ n  ii]/h@xmath19 may be one of the most useful calibrations since it is not affected by dust extinction due to the very close positions of the two related lines in wavelength , and can be detected by the near infrared instruments for the intermediate- and high-@xmath117 star - forming galaxies .",
    "we should notice that the derived calibration will result in a higher 12+log(o / h ) abundance at a given [ n  ii]/h@xmath118 ratio than those of pettini & pagel ( 2004 ) and denicol et al .",
    "the main reason for this difference may be due to the discrepancy between the metallicity estimates from the @xmath12-method and @xmath15-method .    the resulting calibrations are more suitable for luminous and metal - rich galaxies since they have metallicities in the range 8.4@xmath2 12+log(o / h)@xmath47 @xmath29.3 . because our calibrations are derived from sdss data , they will be best suited for data which samples the inner few kiloparsecs of galaxies rather than the whole disk .",
    "this aperture effect is most significant for line ratios with a strong dependence on ionization parameter ( e.g. [ n  ii]/[o  iii ] ) .",
    "the observed calibration relations are compared with the photoionization models from kd02 , which generally show good consistent trends , including the turnover trend of [ n  ii]/h@xmath19 at the metal - rich end , the independence of [ n  ii]/[o  ii ] on ionization parameter , etc .",
    "however , most of these sample galaxies are distributed in a narrower range of the ionization parameter @xmath3 than the models .",
    "the actual range of @xmath3 is from @xmath84 to @xmath87 cms@xmath6 , i.e. , log@xmath7=-3.5 to -2.5 , but the models cover from @xmath83 to @xmath89 cms@xmath6 , i.e. , log@xmath7=-3.78 to -2 .",
    "another contribution of this work is that we obtained the log(n / o ) abundance ratios for this large sample of sdss star - forming galaxies with 8.4@xmath2 12+log(o / h)@xmath29.3 .",
    "their log(n / o ) abundances are consistent with the combination of the primary `` and secondary '' components of nitrogen , but the secondary \" one dominates at high metallicities .",
    "the increasing log(n / o ) abundances that follow the increasing metallicities for these metal - rich galaxies can be the prediction of continuous but declining star formation rates , which is confirmed by the linear relation with a negative slope of the log(n / o)@xmath115 versus log(ew(h@xmath19 ) ) .",
    "the scatter of these observational data are @xmath170.062dex in the log(n / o ) versus 12+log(o / h ) relations .",
    "however , we should notice that dust extinction strongly affects the estimates of the log(n / o ) abundance ratios and the corresponding scatter for the sample galaxies .    in summary , this work provides several useful metallicity calibrations based on strong emission - line ratios of 38,478 sdss star - forming galaxies , and estimates the log(n / o ) abundance ratios for such a large number of galaxies .",
    "these can be used as references for future studies of metallicities of galaxies .",
    "we should notice that , when these calibrations are used for high redshift objects , the indices based on [ n  ii ] may have some extra uncertainties since for very high redshifts",
    "n / o vs. o / h may be different from the local case because the galaxies are not old enough to produce significant amounts of secondary nitrogen .",
