    "in order to gather more information on the heavy quark pdfs it is important to investigate in detail processes sensitive to them .",
    "direct photon production in association with a heavy quark ( c or b ) is exactly one such process due to its dependence on subprocesses sensitive to the initial state heavy quark ( hq ) distributions @xcite . at lo",
    "it has a simple form  it consists of one hard - scattering subprocess , @xmath3 ( compton subprocess ) , and also fragmentation contributions subprocesses of order @xmath4 containing at least one heavy quark in the final state convoluted with the photon fragmentation function @xmath5 . ] , these being greatly suppressed due to experimental isolation requirements . at nlo",
    "the number of contributing hard - scattering subprocesses increases to seven :    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     also including nlo fragmentation effects , which are small due to the isolation cuts as in the lo case",
    ". given that most of the subprocesses are initiated by either heavy quarks or gluons , and in the proton the gluon distribution is well known , it is possible to focus on constraining the heavy quark pdf through measurements of this process .      in the standard global analysis of pdfs , heavy quarks do not have free fit parameters associated with them .",
    "therefore currently it is assumed that there is no intrinsic charm ( ic ) or intrinsic bottom ( ib ) inside the nucleus .",
    "this means that the heavy quark pdf can be obtained purely perturbatively through the use of the dglap evolution equations , having set an appropriate initial condition ( such as @xmath6 ) .",
    "however there is no theoretical reason that this should be the case and moreover there have been some data that point towards the existence of an intrinsic charm component in the proton ( @xmath7 at large @xmath8 as measured by emc @xcite ) . as a result",
    "there are non - perturbative models predicting the size and shape of the intrinsic heavy quark component @xcite which are used in pdf global fits @xcite .. ] in fig .",
    "[ fig : ic ] the difference between different ic pdfs and the radiatively radiate charm ( cteq6.6 m ) is displayed .",
    "both the bhps ( dashed red line ) and meson cloud model ( dotted green line ) display a similar behavior where they peak at high @xmath8 , while being very similar to the radiatively generated charm ( solid black line ) at lower @xmath8 .",
    "the purely phenomenologically inspired sea - like model ( dash - dotted blue line ) produces a pdf which is larger than the radiatively generated one in a broad @xmath8 range . in order to constrain precisely the hq pdf",
    "it is important to measure processes sensitive to it such as @xmath2 . how these different models affect the @xmath2 cross - section is presented in the next section",
    "the differential cross - section vs @xmath9 for @xmath10 and @xmath11 production at the tevatron is presented at both nlo and lo in fig .  [",
    "fig : tevatron1 ] .",
    "from there we see that the difference between @xmath12 and @xmath13 at lo stays almost constant , whereas it decreases at nlo with growing @xmath9 .",
    "the reason for this is that at the tevatron , due to the abundance of valance quarks and anti - quarks , the annihilation subprocess ( @xmath14 ) starts to dominate the cross - section , and this subprocess is exactly the same for both @xmath10 and @xmath11 production .",
    "when one looks at the comparison between theory and experimental measurements ( performed by the d  collaboration @xcite ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : d01 ] , the agreement for @xmath11 is very good , whereas for @xmath10 the data overshoot the theoretical predictions at high @xmath15 .",
    "one possibility to try and correct for this discrepancy is to utilize ic pdfs in the theoretical predictions . in fig .",
    "[ fig : d02 ] the data over theory ratio is presented , as well as the ratios @xmath16 , @xmath17 . as expected the sea - like cross - section overshoots the data at low @xmath15 , but undershoots it at high @xmath15 .",
    "conversely the bhps cross - section , follows the data trend , and provides a better description than both the radiatively generated charm and the sea - like charm cross - section , however it still undershoots the data at very high @xmath15 . therefore in order to confirm or disprove the existence of ic more data for processes sensitive to ic",
    "is needed . in the next subsection",
    "the effects of ic on the direct photon and heavy quark cross - section , and the possibility of constraining ic at the lhc are presented .    : for charm at nlo ( black solid line ) , at lo ( black dash - dotted line ) , for bottom at nlo ( red dashed line ) , at lo ( red dotted line ) . ]",

[ fig : ic ] ) , one has to probe forward rapidities in order to be sensitive to it . utilizing experimental cuts appropriate for the cms detector @xcite and focusing on the forward rapidity region ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) for both photons and c - quarks , we present in fig .",
    "[ fig : cms1 ] the predictions for @xmath12 at @xmath22 tev .",
    "the bhps cross - section ( green dashed line ) is similar to the radiatively generated one ( black solid curve ) at low @xmath15 , but as @xmath15 increases ( and correspondingly @xmath8 increases ) so does the difference between the two curves , thus providing a possibility for testing the existence of bhps ic . to portray the need for measurements at",
    "forward rapidities the ratio between the bhps cross - section and the radiatively generated one for several different combinations of the photon and heavy quark rapidities is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : cms2 ] . there",
    "the ratio at larger @xmath15 increases from @xmath23 for @xmath24 & @xmath25 , to up to @xmath26 for @xmath20 & @xmath21 .",
    "it is also interesting to study the ic effects in @xmath1 collisions .",
    "however in order for such a study to be performed , the gluon nuclear pdf ( npdf ) should be as well known as in the free proton .",
    "unfortunately this is not the case , and the gluon distribution is only very weakly constrained by nmc data on @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "production at rhic . ] the large uncertainty in the nuclear gluon as well as the variations in predictions of different fits ( ncteq @xcite , hkn07 ( red dash - dotted band ) @xcite ,",
    "eps09 @xcite ) is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : npdf1 ] in the form of the gluon nuclear modification factor @xmath29 .",
    "it is quite clear that there is a strong need for data constraining the gluon npdf . in the general framework , where there is no ic considered , and the charm distribution is solely based on the gluon pdf ,",
    "the charm nuclear modification , @xmath30 , follows @xmath31 quite closely as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : npdf2 ] . since @xmath32 is quite sensitive to the gluon pdf as well as the charm pdf as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : alice1 ] , where the dominating subprocesses at @xmath33 for @xmath34 collisions are @xmath35 and @xmath36 initiated , it is a very useful process for constraining the gluon npdf .",
    "focusing on the central rapidity region in alice will isolate any effects caused by the possible presence of the theoretically favored bhps - ic , which will appear at large-@xmath8 and forward rapidity , fig .",
    "[ fig : cms2 ] .",
    "therefore we can expect that the nuclear corrections to @xmath32 will follow the ones for @xmath31 and @xmath30 correspondingly . in fig .",
    "[ fig : alice2 ] the nuclear modification factor , @xmath37 , to the direct photon and heavy quark cross - section is shown .",
    "it can be seen clearly by comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : alice2 ] and the boxed region in fig .",
    "[ fig : npdf1 ] that the nuclear modification factor to the cross - section , @xmath38 , follows closely the nuclear modifications for the gluon npdf ( @xmath31 ) , in the region of x probed at the lhc ; for more details see @xcite .",
    "therefore this process is an excellent candidate for constraining the gluon nuclear distribution .",
    "it was shown that through direct photon production in association with a heavy quark we can study and constrain the heavy quark pdfs .",
    "more specifically measurements at the tevatron of this process have indicated a possible existence of ic that seems to favor the bhps model .",
    "further tests at the lhc of this process especially at forward rapidities should be able to constrain or disfavor the presence of intrinsic charm in the proton . while such a constrain inside the nucleus is also very important , one has to have a quite precisely determined gluon npdf in order to do so . since this is not the case , we have shown here that direct photon + heavy quark production at pa collisions is also a great process for constraining the nuclear gluon pdf .",
