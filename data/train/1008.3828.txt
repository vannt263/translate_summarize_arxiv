    ", an intermediate - age thick disk would emerge from heating of the thin disk , in conflict with the old ages found .",
    "a proposed solution is that the old thick disk is a result of direct accretion of old stars from a few satellite galaxies @xcite .",
    "the metal - poor stars in the thick disk would then show the same chemical enrichment as the parent satellite . depending on the mass , orbit , and density profile of each accreted satellite ,",
    "the @xmath1-abundance patterns of the thick disk would also vary with galactic radius .",
    "the identification and chemical analysis of metal - poor thick - disk stars beyond the solar neighborhood is therefore very important .",
    "the existence of a significant metal - weak ( @xmath0}\\leq-1.0 $ ] ) thick disk remains controversial .",
    "the metal - poor thick disk was identified in both the field @xcite , and in globular clusters @xcite .",
    "the apparent lack of blue horizontal - branch and rr lyrae stars in the thick disk , however , argues against an old metal - poor component @xcite .",
    "the small number of metal - poor thick - disk stars studied to date @xcite have high [ @xmath1/fe ] ratios , implying they formed in a short - duration star formation event , and old ages when estimates are available .",
    "these samples , however , have been limited to very bright stars within the solar neighborhood .",
    "the unprecedented size of the radial velocity experiment spectroscopic survey ( rave , * ? ? ? * ) and its selection without either kinematic or metallicity criteria provide a unique opportunity to study a statistically significant sample of bright metal - poor thick - disk stars , as described below . our sample both probes a much larger volume and extends to lower metallicities than any previous thick - disk sample with elemental abundances .",
    "we here present elemental abundance results for a subsample of ( predominantly ) red giant branch ( rgb ) and red clump / horizontal branch ( rc / hb ) stars .",
    "candidate metal - poor thick - disk stars were selected from rave , a _ magnitude - limited _ survey that uses the 6df spectrograph on the uk schmidt telescope to obtain high s / n , @xmath3 spectra (  ) of stars in the southern sky with @xmath4 .",

    "a total of @xmath13 spectra for candidate metal - poor thick - disk stars were obtained .",
    "we removed potentially problematic stars ( e.g. hot stars , fast rotators ) , in addition to 4 radial - velocity outliers , probable binary stars , after comparison with rave ( @xmath14  ) .",
    "ten of the remaining stars have repeat echelle observations .",
    "we here report on the subsample of evolved stars ( @xmath15 ) , consisting of 212 rgb stars and 31 rc / hb stars , for which a uniform analysis is implemented .",

    "external errors are critical in distance determination .",
    "we tested the accuracy of our parameters using echelle data ( obtained for another project ) of several globular cluster rgb stars ( @xmath18 ) for which the distances and metallicities are reported in the literature .",
    "we also reanalyzed a sample ( hereafter f00/hip ) of 6 giant stars from f00 which had hipparcos parallaxes with acceptable errors ( @xmath19 ; * ? ? ?",
    "we found that with our initial parameter values many globular cluster giants lay above the rgb - tip , contrary to their location in the cmd , implying that our initial @xmath6 estimate is too low .",
    "further , the interplay between @xmath6 and @xmath5 in our initial analysis implies that our @xmath5 estimate would also be suspect .",
    "we therefore computed independent estimates of both gravity and temperature to quantify these effects and hence correct them .",
    "the independent estimate of surface gravity for each globular cluster and f00/hip star was obstained using the equation @xmath20 .",
    "we adopt our initial estimate of @xmath5 , a typical rgb star mass of @xmath21 , and estimated the luminosity from the de - reddened 2mass @xmath22 with bolometric corrections derived from @xcite and the published distance .",
    "we also derived an independent photometric temperature , @xmath23 , for each star using the 2mass color - temperature transformations from @xcite .",
    "we assumed that the scale provided by @xmath23 does not show spurious trends such as apparently introduced by our initial spectroscopic analysis , and thus can be used to correct our @xmath6 estimates ( as achieved below ) .",
    "comparisons between our spectroscopic estimates and these derived values revealed offsets in both temperature and gravity . further , the difference between our spectroscopic @xmath5 estimates and @xmath23 is correlated with iron abundance such that our estimate is @xmath24  k cooler for the lowest metallicity stars ( note both @xcite and @xcite found similar offsets , albeit using different photometric colors in the derivation of @xmath23 ) .",

    "we adopt a new @xmath6 estimate from this correlation along with the corrected temperature above to get a final estimate of the iron abundance .",

    "stars within @xmath32 of this point were assumed to have an absolute magnitude equal to that of that point . note that @xmath33 ranges between only @xmath34 magnitudes during the slow - evolution phase of core - helium burning .",
    "we assumed an old age for the rgb stars , performing a weighted average over isochrones of ages 10 , 11 , and 12  gyr ( reducing the age to 5  gyr increased the distances by only 10% ) , while we assume an age of 12  gyr for the rc / hb stars .",
    "we first applied this technique to the cluster and f00/hip stars .",
    "our distances differed from literature values by only @xmath35 for the cluster stars and @xmath36 for the f00/hip stars .",
    "we therefore adopted a conservative estimate of 20% error on the distance , including both scatter and offset .",
    "distance estimates based on rave pipeline values of stellar parameters are now available@xcite .",
    "our distance estimates for the 172 stars with @xmath37 are shorter than those of zwitter et al . by @xmath38 .",
    "note that our technique was optimized for metal - poor stars with echelle parameters , while @xcite optimized their method for all stars in the rave catalog , which have a high mean metallicity and typically younger ages .",
    "the average distance to our rave stars is @xmath39  kpc ; all within @xmath40  kpc , except one at @xmath41  kpc .",
    "the majority of our stars have galactic longitudes between @xmath42 and @xmath43 and galactic latitudes @xmath44 , extending to an average vertical height of @xmath45  kpc .      the 3-d , cylindrical space motion ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) of each star",
    "was computed by combining the derived distances and radial velocities with proper motions from the rave database .",

    "each component of a star s space motion was then re - sampled 10,000 times , assuming a normal distribution centered on our estimate of the component velocity , with standard deviation equal to the propagated error in the velocity .",
    "we computed the probability that each re - sampled value of the space motion was drawn from a given kinematic population , based on the combined local characteristic gaussian distributions assumed for each galactic population ( see table [ tab - gaus ] ) , defined as : @xmath50 where , for each population , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 are the characteristic velocity dispersions and @xmath54 is the mean rotational velocity ( corrected for the sun s motion ) . note that gaussian distributions are a first - order approximation , and the distribution functions may be much more complex ( cf .",

    "intermediate populations , thin / thick and thick / halo , were assigned for lower values of probability ratios .",
    "a star was assigned to the galactic population with the highest number of occurrences from the 10,000 re - sampled points .",
    "a second population assignment was determined by comparing a star s position in the galaxy to the characteristic density distributions of each galactic component ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , following the same monte carlo procedure as the space motion criterion .",
    "this criterion works well far from the galactic plane , however discrimination is difficult close to the plane since a star must have @xmath55  kpc before the thick disk probability is 4 times that of the thin disk .",
    "the assignment is therefore restricted to choosing only halo over thick disk or thick over thin disk .",
    "the final population assignment was then the result from the space motion criterion , unless overridden by the boundary condition set from the star s position .",
    "our results are consistent with each star s position in the reduced proper motion diagram .",
    "these final assignments were 73 thick disk , 1 thin disk , 22 thick / thin , 31 thick / halo , and 116 halo .",
    "the toomre diagram ( figure  [ fig - toom ] ) illustrates the correspondence between these population assignments and velocities .",
    "it is not surprising that many candidates were assigned to the halo since , with our final parameter values , our sample extends to large distances and high velocities .",
    "elemental abundances were derived through moog after all stellar parameter corrections in  3 . figure  [ fig - alf ] displays [ @xmath1/fe ] as a function of [ fe / h ] for several @xmath1-elements .",

    "the [ @xmath1/fe ] ratios for these stars are enhanced , indicating that the metal - poor thick disk was enriched by sne ii , before sne ia enrichment , implying a timescale for star formation shorter than @xmath60  gyr .",
    "the relatively low scatter in [ @xmath1/fe ] ratios also implies that the ism was well mixed prior to star formation , and the metal - poor thick - disk stars were enriched by supernovae from an invariant massive star imf .",
    "further , the metal - poor thick disk and halo stars show similar @xmath1-enhancement , evidence that they were pre - enriched by the same massive star imf .",
    "the @xmath1-enhancement in the metal - poor thick disk contrasts with that seen in stars of similar metallicities in local dwarf galaxies ( as reviewed by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "all local dwarf galaxies began star formation early , @xmath61  gyr ago , and had extended star formation , often with dominant intermediate - age populations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . direct accretion of stars by assimilation of dwarf satellite galaxies into the thin and thick disks in the @xcite models lasts until @xmath62 ( @xmath63  gyr ago ) .",
    "if the accreted dwarf galaxies formed stars until accretion or had extended star formation similar to surviving dwarfs , then many of the accreted stars will have formed from gas which had significant iron contribution from sne ia .",
    "consequently , stars accreted from dwarfs into the thick disk after this time will have low [ @xmath1/fe ] ratios @xcite , contrary to the enhancement we see in our sample .",
    "we conclude that direct accretion of stars from dwarf galaxies similar to surviving dwarf galaxies today did not play a major role in the formation of the thick disk .",
    "another possibility is that the thick disk was formed from multiple gas - rich minor mergers , as simulated by @xcite .",
    "this model predicts a high star formation rate from the gas dissipation , consistent with our enhanced [ @xmath1/fe ] , but the model includes direct accretion of stars from the satellite galaxies .",
    "we would therefore still expect to find some low [ @xmath1/fe ] stars in the thick disk from _ late _ merging , which conflicts with our low scatter in the abundance ratios of the metal - poor thick disk .",
    "early heating of a thin stellar disk by mergers , however , is still viable",
    ".    the amplitude of radial and vertical gradients in abundances and metallicity will provide diagnostics to further discriminate models of the formation of the thick disk .",
    "our sample , which probes distances much further from the solar neighborhood , is the first for which this can be done , and will be investigated in our next paper ( ruchti et al .",
