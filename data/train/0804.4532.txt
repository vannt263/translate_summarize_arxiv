    "<S> the dc magnetic susceptibility exhibited the logarithmic divergent behavior at low temperatures ( @xmath6 6.8 k ) . </S>",
    "<S> this could be understood by the impurity spin effect , dressed by the spin fluctuation . from the ac magnetic susceptibility measurements , the real part of the ac - susceptibility for @xmath2(ab ) </S>",
    "<S> exhibited the spin glass - like behavior at low temperatures ( @xmath7 4 k ) . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , for an applied ac magnetic field with @xmath2(c)-axis , the sign of the ac magnetic susceptibility changed from a positive to a negative value with increasing ac magnetic field frequency ( @xmath8 3 khz ) at low temperatures ( @xmath6 7 k ) . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret the sign change of ac magnetic susceptibility along the _ c_-axis in terms of the sudden sign reversal of the phase difference @xmath9 from in - phase to out - of - phase response with an applied ac magnetic field in the ac - susceptibility phase space . </S>",
