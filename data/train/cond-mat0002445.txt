    "the authors obtained a phase of paired holes and at higher doping levels , four - hole clusters ( or two - pair clusters ) .",
    "we therefore argue that for increasing doping the phase remains @xmath1-independent in even - leg ladders , but not in odd - leg ladders .",
    "we finally note that including next nearest neighbor hopping terms etc .",
    ", the fermi momenta of band pairs add up no more exactly to @xmath59 , i.e. , @xmath187 .",
    "however , since the phases are controlled by the relative size of gaps , only a _ sufficiently large perturbation _ can qualitatively change the corresponding physics .",
    "we have studied the doping away from half - filling in @xmath0-leg hubbard ladders in the case of a small on - site repulsion @xmath1 , where the ladders are equivalent to a @xmath0-band model . at half - filling ,",
    "the @xmath0 fermi velocities are such that @xmath2 . using rg and bosonization techniques ,",
    "we have obtained a hierarchy of energy - scales @xmath188 , where the couplings of the band pair @xmath80 ( and of the single band @xmath6 for @xmath0 odd ) are of the order of the bandwidth @xmath8 , decoupled from the other bands , and at a two - leg ladder fixed point .",
    "the low - energy hamiltonian is then the sum of @xmath4 [ @xmath5 for @xmath0 odd ] two - leg ladder hamiltonians , corresponding to the band pairs @xmath80 , without gapless excitations ( plus for odd @xmath0 the hamiltonian of a single chain with one gapless spin - mode ) .",
    "we thus obtain the same phases as for the heisenberg spin - ladders .    upon doping ,",
    "the holes enter first the band ( pair ) with the smallest gap @xmath153 . in odd - leg ladders , this is the nonbonding band @xmath6 and the phase is a dilute gas of holons ( here , the fermionic kinks ) and spinons ( c1s1 ) , while in even - leg ladders , the band pair @xmath7 is doped first and the phase consists of singlets of paired holes ( c1s0 ) , reflecting the odd - even effect at half - filling ( i.e. , of heisenberg spin - ladders ) . the same phases have been found in numerical works for the @xmath8-@xmath9 model  @xcite , i.e. , at and close to half - filling , the phases of the @xmath0-leg hubbard ladders are the same for small and large @xmath1 .    for a finite @xmath1 and at low doping , the ladders can be described by an effective @xmath4-band model [ @xmath6-band model for @xmath0 odd ] of spinless fermions , where the ( effective ) band @xmath34 corresponds to the band pair @xmath80 and the bottoms of these bands are at the energy - scales @xmath153 . upon doping ,",
    "the hole - pairs then subsequently enter these bands and the fs is successively opened , first near the wave vector @xmath10 and finally also near @xmath23 and @xmath24 , similarly as in the 2d case  @xcite . in addition , we obtain peaks in the compressibility at critical dopings @xmath169 , where the first hole - pair enters the band pair @xmath80 .    for increasing doping , the @xmath1-independence of the phase seems to break down , at least for odd - leg ladders .",
    "however , the @xmath1-independence and the similarity to the 2d case at and close to half - filling support the hope that also in 2d , some of the weak - coupling rg results can be extended to large @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the renormalization group ( rg ) method is a controlled way of subsequently eliminating ( integrating out ) high - energy modes in a given hamiltonian . while the noninteracting part @xmath30 is at a _",
    "rg fixed point _ , couplings of the interacting part @xmath189 may grow or decrease under a rg transformation ( i.e. , when lowering the energy ) .",
    "a subsequent ( perturbative ) elimination of high - energy modes in @xmath189 then results in rges , which give the change of the coupling when lowering the energy , see ref .  @xcite .",
    "below , we give the rges for the couplings of the three - leg ladder .",
    "fully taking into account the symmetries [ i.e. , su(2 ) , u(1 ) , and @xmath190 , there are 21 independent rges . using _ operator product expansion _ for the products of the various currents , the derivation is straightforward @xcite .",
    "similar rges are obtained in the case @xmath191",
    "@xcite .    for the half - filled three - leg ladder @xmath192 , such that @xmath193 , @xmath194 , and @xmath195 .",

    "the initial values of the three - band couplings read @xmath199 the rges take the following form , where the energy - scale is related to @xmath91 by @xmath92 .",
    "starting with the above initial values the rges are then numerically integrated up to the scale @xmath200 , where the first coupling is of the order of the bandwidth @xmath8 . for one - loop rges , @xmath201 , where @xmath202 ( this can easily be checked by multiplying the rges with @xmath203 ) .",
