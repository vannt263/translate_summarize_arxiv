    "ieee 802.11a / b / g / n based wireless local area networks ( lans ) in `` infrastructure mode '' are very common in many places . in this paper",
    ", we are concerned with an analytical model for evaluating the performance of tcp - controlled downloads in a wlan .",
    "`` tcp '' is the transmission control protocol , which is regarded as the workhorse of the internet ; numerous applications , including web browsing , file transfer , and secure e - commerce , rely on tcp as the transport protocol .",
    "the system we consider is shown in figure  [ fig : ap_sta ] .",
    "a detailed analysis of the aggregate throughput of tcp - controlled file downloads for a `` single rate '' access point ( ap ) is given in kuriakose et al .",
    "@xcite ; in this , all stas are assumed to be associated with the ap at the same rate . in practice , many data rates are possible and hence considering multiple rates is important .",
    "the aggregate download throughput is evaluated for the _ two rates _ case in krusheel and kuri @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we consider an arbitrary but finite number @xmath4 of possible rates of association between stations ( sta ) and a single ap .",
    "we are motivated to study an analytical model because of the improved understanding that it leads to , and the useful insights that it can provide .",
    "closed - form expressions or numerical calculation procedures are helpful because other features and capabilities can be built upon them .",
    "one possible application , which we are studying now , is to utilize the results reported here in devising a better ap - sta association policy .",
    "our approach is to model the number of stas with tcp acknowledgements ( acks ) in their medium access control ( mac ) queues as an embedded discrete time markov chain ( dtmc ) , embedded at the instants of successful transmission events .",
    "we consider a successful transmission from the ap as a reward .",
    "this leads to viewing the aggregate tcp throughput in the framework of renewal reward theory given in kumar @xcite .",
    "almost the entire existing literature considers a _ single _ rate of association only .",
    "this is rather limiting , because in practice , it is extremely likely that a wlan will have stas associated at a number of rates allowed by the technology ( for example , one of 6 mbps , 12 mbps , 18 mbps , 24 mbps , 30 mbps , 36 mbps , 48 mbps or 54 mbps in 802.11 g , and one of 1 mbps , 2 mbps , 5.5 mbps or 11 mbps in 802.11b ) . a first step towards considering multiple association rates",
    "was taken in krusheel and kuri @xcite , but there , only 2 possible association rates were considered . in this paper , _",
    "any _ number of association rates is allowed . because of this , our model is applicable to any variant of wlan technology , for example : 802.11a / b / g / n .",
    "the contributions of this paper are as follows .",
    "we present a model for analyzing the performance of tcp - controlled file transfers with @xmath5 rates of association .",
    "this generalizes earlier work .",
    "secondly , our model incorporates tcp - specific aspects like `` delayed acks ; '' this is a technique to reduce the frequency of tcp ack generation by a tcp receiver . in most implementations ,",
    "a tcp receiver generates a tcp ack for every @xmath6 tcp packet received ; our model is general , and considers that one tcp ack is generated for every @xmath3 tcp packets .",
    "our analytical results are in excellent agreement with simulations , with the discrepancy being less than @xmath7% in all cases .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : related_work ] , related works are discussed . in section",
    "[ sec : system_model ] , we state the assumptions in first part and then present our analysis . in section  [ sec : evaluation ] , we present performance evaluation results . in section  [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we discuss the results .",
    "finally , the paper is concluded in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the literature on throughput modelling in a wlan can be classified into several groups depending on the approach .    in the first group , all wlan entities ( stas and the ap )",
    "are assumed to be _ saturated _ , _ i.e. _ , each entity is backlogged permanently .",
    "bianchi @xcite , kumar et al .",
    "@xcite and cali et al .",
    "@xcite consider this saturated traffic model .",
    "however , our interest is in modelling aggregate _",
    "throughput , and the saturated traffic model does not capture the situation well .    to see why unsaturated traffic makes a difference , we consider figure [ fig : unsaturated ] .",
    "the left part shows a saturated traffic scenario , where all wlan entities have packets to transmit ; therefore , @xmath8 entities contend for the channel .",
    "the right part shows the situation with tcp in the picture .",
    "essentially , for many tcp connections , the entire window of packets sits at the ap , leaving the corresponding stas with nothing to send .",
    "this means that the number of contending wlan entities is much smaller as mentioned in kuriakose et al .",
    "this indicates why approaches relying on a model with saturated nodes are inadequate .",
    "the second group considers tcp traffic .",
    "kuriakose et al .",
    "@xcite propose a model for tcp - controlled file downloads in a _ single rate _ wlan ; _ i.e. , _ one in which all stas are associated with a single ap at the _ same _ rate .",
    "bruno et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and vendictis et al .",
    "@xcite generalize this and analyze tcp - controlled file uploads as well as downloads ; however , it is assumed again that all stas are associated at the same rate .",
    "similarly , yu et al .",
    "@xcite provide an analysis for a given number of stas and a maximum tcp receive window size by using the well - known @xmath9-persistent model proposed in cali et al .",
    "as noted above , these papers analyze tcp - controlled file transfers ( in some cases udp traffic is allowed as well ) but limit themselves to a single rate of association .    in the third category ,",
    "bharadwaj et al .",
    "@xcite consider _ finite _ ap buffers , in contrast to the previous two , where ap buffers were assumed to be infinite ; however , the single rate assumption is retained .",
    "the three groups mentioned above focus on _ long _ file transfers , where the tcp sender is assumed to have a file that is infinite in size .",
    "miorandi et al .",
    "@xcite model a different situation motivated by web browsing over a wlan . a queuing model",
    "is proposed to compute the mean session delay for short - lived tcp flows .",
    "the impact of maximum tcp congestion window size on this delay is studied as well . even though a fair amount of work modelling tcp - controlled transfers has been done , we are unaware of any work that allows _ multiple _ ap - sta association rates . clearly , this is the situation observed most often in practice , where the distance between the ap and a sta governs the rate of association . in this paper , we consider an arbitrary ( but finite ) number of rates of association between stas and the ap ; to the best of our knowledge , this is the first paper to consider this general model .",
    "we consider @xmath10 stations associated with an ap as shown in figure [ fig : ap_sta ] .",
    "all the nodes contend for the channel using the dcf mechanism as given in ieee 802.11a / b / g / n .",
    "the stations are associated with the ap at @xmath4 different physical rates ( @xmath11 stas at rate @xmath0 , @xmath12 stas at rate @xmath1 , @xmath13 @xmath14 stas at rate @xmath2 ) .",
    "we assume that there are no link errors .",
    "this is not merely a simplifying assumption ; the `` auto rate fallback '' mechanism , implemented widely in stas and aps , is intended to ensure that we have an _ error - free but lower rate _",
    "channel rather than a higher rate but error - prone channel .",
    "thus , our assumption of no link errors is consistent with the usual mode of wlan operation .",
    "packets in the medium are lost only due to collisions .",
    "each station has a single tcp connection to download long files from the server and all tcp connections have equal window sizes .",
    "the ap transmits tcp packets for the stations and the stations return tcp - ack packets .",
    "further , we assume that the ap uses the rts - cts mechanism while sending packets to stations and stations use basic access to send ack packets ( rts : request to send , cts : clear to send ; these are control packets that reserve the wireless medium for the subsequent long data packet ) . in ieee",
    "802.11 wlans , the parameter determines whether the rts - cts exchange will precede a packet transmission . in most operational wlans ,",
    "the rts threshold is set such that tcp data packets are larger than the rts threshold , and hence sent after rts - cts exchange , while tcp ack packets are smaller than the rts threshold , and hence sent without rts - cts exchange ( the latter is referred to as `` basic access '' ) . upon reception of @xmath3 data packets",
    ", a sta generates an ack packet and it is enqueued at the mac layer for transmission .",
    "we assume that all nodes have sufficiently large buffers , so that packets are not lost due to buffer overflow .",
    "also , tcp timeouts do not occur .",
    "tcp start - up transients are ignored by considering all connections to be in congestion avoidance . for long file transfers ( which we are considering in this paper ) , this is a reasonable assumption because the initial start - up phase of a tcp connection lasts for a time that is completely negligible compared to the connection lifetime ; the tcp connection moves quickly to the congestion avoidance phase and remains there .",
    "the value of rtt is very small , since files are downloaded from a server located on the lan as shown in figure  [ fig : ap_sta ] .",
    "thus , several tcp connections exist simultaneously and all stas with tcp ack packets , and the ap ( which is full of tcp data packets for the stas ) , contend for the channel .",
    "since no preference is given to the ap , and it has to serve all stas , the ap becomes a bottleneck , and it is modelled as being backlogged permanently .",
    "the aggregate throughput of the ap is shared equally among all @xmath10 stations .",
    "let @xmath15 be the number of stations associated with the ap at the physical transmission rate @xmath16 , where @xmath17 @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "given that the ap wins the channel , the conditional probability that it sends a tcp data packet to a station at rate @xmath20 is @xmath21 .",
    "we assume that @xmath22 is large .",
    "our results will show that @xmath23 or @xmath24 , @xmath25 ( with @xmath26 ) suffices for the analysis to be applicable .",
    "figure  [ fig : channel_activity ] shows a possible sample path of the events on the wlan channel .",
    "the random epochs @xmath27 indicate the end of the @xmath28 successful transmission from either the ap or one of the stations .",
    "we observe that most stas have empty mac queues , because , in order for many stas to have tcp - ack packets , the ap must have had a long run of successes  and this is unlikely because no special preference is given to the ap .",
    "so when the ap succeeds in transmitting , the packet is likely to be for a sta with an empty mac queue .    at epoch",
    "@xmath29 , let @xmath30 be the number of stations at rate @xmath20 , ready with an ack .",
    "let @xmath31 be the number of nonempty stas .",
    "if there are @xmath32 nonempty stas and a nonempty ap , each nonempty wlan entity attempts to transmit with probability @xmath33 as in kumar et al .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath34 is the attempt probability with @xmath8 _ saturated _ entities .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath35 evolves as a discrete time markov chain ( dtmc ) over the epochs @xmath27 .",
    "this allows us to consider @xmath36 as a markov renewal sequence , and @xmath37 as a semi - markov process .",
    "stations associated with the ap at @xmath38 different data rates . ]",
    "we have a multidimensional dtmc which is shown in figure [ fig : markovchain ] ; transition probabilities are indicated as well .",
    "a sta generates a tcp ack after receiving @xmath3 tcp packets ; this is incorporated in our model in the following way . when the dtmc state is @xmath39 , there are @xmath40 backlogged wlan entities ( including the ap ) ; so , the probability that a station at rate @xmath16 wins the channel is @xmath41 , since each entity is equally likely to win the contention .",
    "further , given that a sta at rate @xmath16 wins the channel , the conditional probability that it will generate a tcp - ack is @xmath42 .    by inspection",
    ", we can say that the dtmc is irreducible ; further , the detailed balanced equation holds for a properly chosen set of equilibrium probabilities . the detailed balance equation ( dbe )",
    "is    @xmath43    here @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the stationary distribution of the dtmc . from the set of equations given in and @xmath46 the stationary distribution is @xmath47 to obtain the throughput",
    ", we use markov regenerative analysis , culminating in the renewal reward theorem given in wolff @xcite , kumar @xcite . for a given state @xmath48 , successive entries into state @xmath49 form renewal epochs . to obtain the mean time between successive entries ( the mean renewal cycle lengths )",
    ", we obtain the mean sojourn time in the state @xmath48 .",
    "let @xmath50 be the sojourn time in a state @xmath51 .",
    "conditioning on various events ( idle slot , collision or successful transmission ) that can happen in the next time slot , the following expression for the mean cycle length can be written down : + @xmath52 in the above expression , @xmath53 is the probability of the slot being idle , @xmath54 is the probability that the ap wins the contention and transmits the data packet at rate @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the probability that a sta associated at rate @xmath16 wins the channel ( `` s '' in the suffix stands for `` success '' ) .",
    "correspondingly , the conditional expected sojourn times in state @xmath57 , given the events are , respectively , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "detailed expressions for these quantities are provided in the appendix .",
    "the @xmath61 and @xmath62 terms on the right side of correspond to collision events .",
    "the third term in arises when the ap transmits a tcp data packet to a station at rate @xmath20 and some other stations are involved in a collision ; in other words , the third term captures the situations in which the ap is involved in a collision .",
    "the fifth term in captures collision events in which the ap is _ not _ involved ; we have a sta transmitting a tcp ack packet to the ap at rate @xmath20 and one or more other stas transmitting simultaneously .",
    "the various probabilities have been obtained by using the attempt probability @xmath63 , when there are @xmath64 contending nodes . from equation",
    "we have @xmath65 @xmath66    we are interested in finding the long run time average of successful transmissions from the ap .",
    "we obtain this by applying the renewal reward theorem of wolf @xcite . to get the mean renewal cycle length",
    ", we can use the mean sojourn time given in equation   and use theorem  5.3 in @xcite .",
    "the mean reward in a cycle can be obtained as follows .",
    "a reward of 1 is earned when the ap transmits a tcp data packet successfully by winning the channel .",
    "the probability of the ap winning the channel is @xmath67 .",
    "similarly , a reward of 0 is earned with probability @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , the expected reward is @xmath67 .    putting all this together",
    ", the aggregate tcp throughput can be calculated as @xcite + @xmath69",
    "to verify the accuracy of the model , we performed experiments using the qualnet  4.5 network simulator @xcite .",
    "we considered 802.11b physical data rates : 1mbps , 2mbps , 5.5mbps and 11mbps ; higher rates correspond to smaller distances between the stas and the ap . in  table",
    "[ table : aps_stas ] , results are given for a few cases of this multirate scenario .",
    "for example , the first row considers a total of 10 stas associated with the ap , out of which 2 stas are associated at 11  mbps and 2  mbps respectively , while 3 stas are associated at 5.5  mbps and 1  mbps , respectively .",
    "the values of @xmath70 in equation are calculated by using the number of stas associated with the ap .",
