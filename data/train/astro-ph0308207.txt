    "the discovery of the first extra - solar planet @xcite and the subsequent discovery of many ( @xmath2 ) additional extra - solar planets @xcite has enhanced the interest in the formation of planets and the evolution of protoplanetary discs .",
    "the observation of the first transiting planet @xcite , giving an estimate of the planet radius , and the relatively large masses ( @xmath3 ) of all the currently detected extra - solar planets , has led to the view that they are all giant gaseous planets .",
    "the most widely studied , and accepted , formation mechanism for gaseous planets is core accretion @xcite in which planetesimals grow by direct collision to form a core which , when sifficiently massive ( @xmath4 ) , then accretes an envelope of gas from the disc .",
    "models @xcite , however , suggest that the timescale for planet formation via this mechanism may be longer than the lifetime of most protoplanetary accretion disc @xcite .",
    "this has led to a renewed interest in the possibility that gas giant planets may have formed directly via a disc instability @xcite .",
    "a protoplanetary disc that is sufficiently massive and cool may form gravitationally bound gaseous objects via the gravitational instability .",
    "this mechanism is extremely rapid and differs from core accretion in that a rocky core is not required .",
    "the possibility that this mechanism may play a role in gaseous planet formation has been enhanced by recent models of the interiors of gaseous planets @xcite which suggest that jupiter could have a relatively small core with @xmath5 .",
    "a keplerian accretion disc with sound speed @xmath6 , surface density @xmath7 , and epicyclic frequency @xmath8 will become gravitationally unstable if the @xcite @xmath9 parameter @xmath10 is of order unity .",
    "a gravitationally unstable disc can either fragment into one or more gravitationally bound objects , or it can evolve into a quasi - steady state in which gravitational instabilities lead to the outward transport of angular momentum .",
    "the exact outcome depends on the rate at which the disc heats up ( through the dissipation of turbulence and gravitational instabilities ) and the rate at which the disc cools .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that a feedback loop may exist .",
    "when @xmath9 is large the disc is stable and cooling dominates , driving the disc towards instability .",
    "when @xmath9 becomes sufficiently small , heating through viscous dissipation dominates , and the disc is returned to a state of marginal stability . in this way",
    "@xmath9 is maintained as a value of @xmath11 .",
    "it has , however , been shown using a local model @xcite that a quasi - stable state can only be maintained if the cooling time @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the local angular frequency . for shorter cooling times the disc fragments .",
    "this is consistent with @xcite that ` almost isothermal ' conditions are necessary for fragmentation , and defines a robust lower limit to the critical cooling time below which fragmentation occurs .",
    "it has been suggested , however , that self - gravitating discs require a strictly global treatment @xcite , and while global effects are highly unlikely to stabilize a locally unstable disc , they could well allow fragmentation within discs that would be locally stable .",
    "this has led to an interest in global simulations of self - gravitating protoplanetary discs @xcite and we discuss , in this paper , results of a number of these simulations .",
    "the three dimensional , global simulations presented here were performed using smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) , a lagrangian hydrodynamics code @xcite .",
    "the central star is modelled as a point mass that may accrete gas particles if they approach within a predefined sink radius , while the gaseous disc is modelled using 250000 sph particles .",
    "a tree is used to determine neighbours and to calculate gravitational forces between gas particles and between gas particles and point masses @xcite .",
    "if in the simulation the disc starts to fragment , producing high density regions , the code can in principle continue .",
    "the high density regions do , however , slow the code down significantly . to continue simulating a fragmenting disc , high density regions that are gravitationally bound",
    "are converted into point masses @xcite which may continue to accrete disc gas . since the likely number of point masses is quite small , compared to the number of gas particles , the gravitational force between point masses",
    "is computed directly .",
    "an additional saving in computational time is also made by using individual particle time - steps @xcite .",
    "the time - steps for each particle is limited by the courant condition and by a force condition @xcite .",
    "we consider a system comprising a central star , modelled as a point mass with mass @xmath14 , surrounded by a gaseous circumstellar disc with mass @xmath15 .",
    "we performed a number of simulations with disc masses of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the disc temperature is taken to have an initial radial profile of @xmath18 @xcite and in most of the simulations the toomre @xmath9 parameter is assumed to be initially constant and to have a value of @xmath19 .",
    "a stable accretion disc where self - gravity leads to a steady outward transport of angular momentum should have a near constant @xmath9 throughout .",
    "a constant @xmath9 together with equation 1 gives a surface density profile of @xmath20 , and hydrostatic equilibrium then gives a central density profile of @xmath21 .",
    "we did , however , perform a single simulation with @xmath16 and with @xmath22 . in this case , @xmath23 gives a @xmath9 that is not constant but that decreases with increasing radial distance .",
    "the temperature was chosen such that the initial minimum value of @xmath9 was 1.5 .",
    "the disc is modelled using 250000 sph particles , which are initially randomly distributed such as to give the specified density profile between inner and outer radii of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "since the calculations are scale free , we take @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . if we were to assume a physical mass scale of @xmath29 m@xmath30 and a length scale of @xmath29 au",
    ", the central star would have a mass of @xmath29 m@xmath30 , the circumstellar disc would have a mass of @xmath31 m@xmath30 or @xmath32 m@xmath30 and would extend from @xmath29 to @xmath33 au , and 1 yr would equal @xmath34 code units .",
    "the main aim of this work is to test if the results obtained by @xcite still hold globally .",
    "consequently we use the same approach in these simulations as was used in the local model .",
    "we use an adiabatic equation of state , with adiabatic index @xmath35 , and allow the gas to heat due to both pdv work and dissipation .",
    "cooling is implemented by adding a simple cooling term to the energy equation .",
    "specifically , for a particle with internal energy per unit mass @xmath36 , @xmath37 where , as in @xcite , @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 with the value of @xmath40 varied for each run .",
    "although the above cooling time is essentially chosen to compare the local model results with results using a global model , it can also be related ( at least approximately ) to the real physics of an accretion disc . for an optically thick disc in equilibrium , the cooling time is given by the ratio of the thermal energy per unit area to the radiative losses per unit area .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that in such a viscous accretion disc , the cooling time is @xmath41 where @xmath13 is the angular frequency in the disc , and @xmath42 is the @xcite viscosity parameter .",
    "we use a three dimensional , global model to consider how cooling times of @xmath43 , and @xmath44 affect the gravitational stability of a protoplanetary accretion disc with @xmath16 and with @xmath20 .",
    "this choice of surface density profile , together with @xmath18 , gives a toomre @xmath9 parameter that is intially constant throughout the disc .",
    "figure [ tc5disc ] shows the final equatorial density structure of the @xmath45 simulation . the central star ( not shown )",
    "is located in the middle of the figure , and the @xmath46 and @xmath47 axes both run from @xmath48 to @xmath33 .",
    "the disc is highly structured and the instability exists at all radii .",
    "however , at no point in the disc has the density increased significantly , and no fragmentation has taken place .",
    "figure [ tc5q ] shows the toomre @xmath9 parameter for the same simulation at three different times during the simulation . at the beginning of the simulation",
    "( @xmath49 ) @xmath9 has an almost constant value of @xmath19 . at the end of the simulation ( @xmath50 )",
    "the value of @xmath9 is almost unity between radii of @xmath29 and @xmath51 . comparing @xmath9 at @xmath52 and @xmath50",
    "shows that the cooling initially reduces @xmath9 to a value below 1 , causing the instability to grow , heating the disc and returning @xmath9 to a value of order unity .",
    "the disc has clearly settled into a quasi - steady state in which the imposed cooling is balanced by heating through the dissipation of the gravitational instability .",
    "figure [ tc3disc ] shows the equatorial disc structure for a simulation with the same disc mass and surface density profile as in figure [ tc5disc ] , but with a cooling time of @xmath44 .",
    "this simulation was only run for 504 time units and hence we show only the inner 8 radii of the simulation .",
    "the disc is again highly structured , but in this case the disc has started to fragment into gravitationally bound clumps , indicated by the bright dots in figure [ tc3disc ] .",
    "the density in the clumps is 4 - 5 orders of magnitude greater than the initial disc density , and to reach the time shown in figure [ tc3disc ] many of the clumps have been converted into point masses @xcite .",
    "figure [ tc3q ] shows the toomre @xmath9 parameter at three different times during the above simulation . at all three times shown",
    ", there is a region which has @xmath9 significantly less than @xmath29 . in the regions where @xmath9 is less than unity",
    ", the instability grows rapidly and produces gravitationally bound fragments .",
    "once formed , these fragments tidally heat the disc , increasing @xmath9 to a value greater than unity .",
    "once @xmath53 , fragmentation ceases and the disc , at that radius , becomes gravitationally stable .",
    "there is , however , likely to be a significant amount of angular momentum transport driven by tidal interactions between the gravitationally bound fragments and the gaseous disc @xcite .      to study how disc mass may influence the global nature of the gravitational instability we consider a disc with a mass of @xmath17 . as in the previous simulations ,",
    "the surface density is taken to have a radial profile of @xmath20 which , together with @xmath18 , gives an intially constant toomre @xmath9 parameter .",
    "although most t tauri discs have masses considerably less than @xmath54 @xcite , there a few with such masses , and this simulation may also apply to an earlier stage of the star formation process when discs are expected to be more massive .",
    "figure [ tc5md025disc ] shows the final equatorial density structure of the above simulation .",
    "the disc is highly structured and the nature of the spirals , compared to the equivalent simulation with @xmath16 , is consistent with the increased disc mass @xcite .",
    "unlike the equivalent lower mass simulation ( see figure [ tc5disc ] ) , there are a number of high density clumps present in the disc .",
    "the standard routine for checking if these clumps are bound initially found them to be unbound .",
    "this routine , however , only considers the nearest @xmath55 sph neighbours . by increasing this to the nearest @xmath56 sph neighbours ,",
    "the densest clump was found to be just gravitationally bound .",
    "this would suggest that in more massive discs , global effects could act to make the disc more unstable , allowing gravitationally bound fragments to grow for cooling times greater than that obtained using a local model .",
    "this could have significant implications for the formation of planets , or binary companions @xcite , reasonably early in the star formation process .",
    "all of the previous simulations were performed assuming @xmath20 , and @xmath18 , giving an initially constant toomre @xmath9 parameter .",
    "we have performed a single simulation with @xmath16 , @xmath18 , and @xmath22 . with these parameters ,",
    "the @xmath9 value decreases with increasing radius .",
    "we therefore normalised our temperature such that @xmath57 at @xmath58 .",
    "figure [ tc5sigr-1 ] shows the final equatorial density structure of a simulation with the above disc parameters , and with an imposed cooling time of @xmath45 .",
    "the disc is again highly structured and unlike the simulation with the same disc mass and cooling time , but with the steeper surface density profile , there is clear evidence of fragmentation in the outer regions of the disc .",
    "the shallower surface density profile ( @xmath22 ) means that , compared to the steeper surface density profile ( @xmath20 ) , there is more mass at large radii .",
    "this suggests that the global nature of the instability may depend both on the mass of the disc , and on how the mass is distributed within the disc .",
    "it has been shown using a local model @xcite that a disc will fragment for cooling times @xmath59 and will settle into a quasi - steady state for cooling times @xmath12 .",
    "we present here results from three - dimensional simulations which test if the local results still holds globally @xcite .",
    "we impose the same cooling function as in @xcite which , although fairly simplistic , can also be justified physically @xcite .    for a disc mass of @xmath16 , a cooling time of @xmath45 , and an initially constant @xmath9 ,",
    "the disc settles into a quasi - steady state in which @xmath9 is of order unity over a large region of the disc .",
    "decreasing the cooling time to @xmath44 causes the disc to rapidly become unstable and produces numerous gravitationally bound clumps . for this disc mass and surface density profile ( @xmath20 ) , the fragmentation boundary therefore seems to agree with that obtained using a local model .",
    "increasing the disc mass to @xmath17 and keeping all other parameters unchanged , however , results in fragmentation for a cooling time of @xmath45 . a similar result was obtained for a simulation in which the disc mass was kept at @xmath16 but in which the surface density profile was changed from @xmath20 to @xmath22 .",
    "these results suggest that global effects may become significant for massive disc or for discs in which the mass is distributed in such a way as to make a particular region of the disc susceptible to the growth of the gravitational instability . for t tauri discs , which generally have masses @xmath60 @xcite , the fragmentation boundary is therefore likely to be close to that determined using the local model .",
    "earlier in the star formation process , when disc may be more massive , fragmentation may occur for longer cooling times than that predicted by the local model results @xcite .    for quiescent t tauri discs ,",
    "the @xcite @xmath42 is conventially estimated to be of the order of @xmath61 or smaller @xcite .",
    "the simple estimate quoted earlier ( see eq . [ pringle ] ) would suggest that such discs are comfortably stable .",
    "@xcite , however , has shown using an approximate treatment of disc heating and cooling , that there may be periods when the cooling time is comparable to the orbital period .",
    "our results suggest that if the disc is fairly massive , such short cooling times may open a window of opportunity for the formation of substellar objects , probably in the form of a multiple system @xcite .",
    "this has important implifications for the formation of giant gaseous planets in protoplanetary discs and may also play a role in the rapid transfer of angular momentum @xcite .",
