    "einstein s classical general relativity is commonly acknowledged as the theory of gravitational interactions for distance sufficiently large compared to the planck length .",
    "this validity has become the foundation of modern cosmology in describing the dynamics of our universe . however , its quantum effects are expected to become important at high energy scale , namely at very early time of cosmological evolution .",
    "especially , the quantization of einstein gravity has long been known to be perturbativly nonrenormalizable .",
    "various attempts on solving this issue have been intensively studied in the literature .",
    "it is widely believed that the quantization of einstein gravity is related to the solution to big bang singularity of our universe .    as early as the discovery of black hole thermodynamics by bekenstein@xcite and hawking@xcite",
    ", people have realized that a nonperturbative feature of einstein gravity may be related to the holographic thermodynamics .",
    "especially , t hooft proposed the holographic principle as a particular property of quantum gravity which states that the description of a volume of space can be thought of as encoded on a boundary of this system , preferably a light - like boundary like a gravitational horizon@xcite .",
    "subsequently , this issue is extensively discussed in cosmology@xcite and recently realized in the context of developments in string theory@xcite .",
    "therefore , it provides a promising description of quantum general relativity .",
    "an extended holographic picture was conjectured by verlinde and in this scenario einstein gravity is originated from an entropic force arising from the thermodynamics on a holographic screen@xcite(see also @xcite and references therein for earlier studies along this direction ) . in this scenario , however , there exists a key controversial issue whether gravity is fundamental or emergent@xcite , and thus relevant reinterpretations of verlinde s entropic force was discussed in @xcite .",
    "recently , a much explicit formulation of entropic gravity theory was suggested by easson , frampton and smoot ( efs ) , in which the general relativity is still a fundamental theory but including a boundary term . in this picture",
    "the holographic entropic force arises from the contribution of boundary terms@xcite .",
    "this model was soon applied to realize current acceleration @xcite and inflationary period at early universe @xcite(see @xcite for a study of entropic inflation within verlinde s proposal ) . in both verlinde s proposal and",
    "efs one , one should be very careful of whether they can explain the current cosmological observations consistently@xcite .",
    "first of all , let us assume gravity is entropic , when applied into cosmology , we should explain why our cmb radiation and the holographic screen are not in thermal equilibrium .",
    "this problem is very manifest , since the temperature of our cmb radiation and thus our universe is observed as @xmath0k , but the horizon temperature can be easily estimated as @xmath1k . in such a thermal system out of equilibrium ,",
    "the heat transfer ought to be very strong . therefore",
    ", if such a heat transfer occurs today and leads to an acceleration , then our universe is always accelerating in the past without radiation and matter dominations since the temperature gap is always very large at early times ( we have @xmath2 and therefore this system can only be in thermal equilibrium at planck scale ) .",
    "this conclusion explains why the modified friedmann equation appeared in the efs paper is so different from the normal one in einstein gravity .    concerning the above question , in the present work we are interested in how to recover a standard friedmann equation from an entropic cosmological system .",
    "we suggest that there exist two holographic screens with one being the approximate hubble horizon which is similar to the de - sitter ( ds ) horizon , while the other schwarzschild horizon .",
    "each screen has its own thermodynamics which is independent of that of the other .",
    "consider the classical dynamics of such a cosmological system , we find that its thermal equilibrium corresponds to a standard frw universe .",
    "therefore this model is able to explain the normal thermal history observed in our universe .",
    "moreover , we consider quantum corrections to the area entropy and obtain an efs universe a little bit deviating from thermal equilibrium .",
    "we study the cosmological implications of this model , and find that it can drive an entropic expansion at early universe and realize the late - time acceleration in a unified approach .",
    "the letter is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we briefly review the idea of entropic force from the viewpoint of an effective action description . in section iii we provide an explicit formulation of the frw universe from the classical thermal equilibrium state of double holographic screens .",
    "effects from higher order quantum corrections of the holographic entropy and a quantum evaporation of the inner horizon are studied in this model .",
    "in section iv we study the cosmological implications of this model involving quantum corrections .",
    "our results show that in this model a holographic inflation could be obtained at high energy scales , and a quantum evaporation process of the inner horizon is related to the realization of the late - time acceleration .",
    "we confront this model with the latest observations at the end of this section , and the results are in agreement with observational constraints .",
    "section v presents a summary and discussions of the related works .",
    "we take the convention @xmath3 in this letter .",
    "we start with a discussion on the standard approach to studying quantum field theory .",
    "the viewpoint of modern physics suggests any fundamental theories can be described by an effective action at certain energy scale .",
    "so does einstein gravity . under this assumption ,",
    "we can obtain the equations of motion to describe the dynamics of these theories from a variational principle . in a usual quantum field theory",
    ", we can integrate out the boundary terms which do not change its physics in minkowski spacetime .",
    "when dealing with a gravitational system , however , one should be very careful of the boundary terms which may play an important role of the background evolution .    in general",
    ", the effective action of a gravitational system including matter fields and surface terms is described by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the ricci scalar of the whole spacetime , @xmath6 is the lagrangian of matter fields living in the bulk , and @xmath7 is the corresponding lagrangian describing the physics of the boundary .",
    "clues from string theory and ads / cft indicate that the boundary terms should include the extrinsic curvature of the boundary and holographic dual gauge theories . in this letter , we take this action as our starting point to describe a holographic picture of the evolution of our universe .    by varying the action with respect to the metric , we can obtain the einstein field equation as follows , @xmath8 in which the last term @xmath9 is a current describing the exchange of energy and momentum between the bulk and the boundary . in usual",
    ", it is described by a delta function in order to satisfy the locality of the theory . however , in the frame of a holographic picture , this term is determined by the holographic description of boundary physics and so is a nonlocal effect , which in our letter corresponds to an entropic force in the universe .",
    "now we assume the boundary physics can be described by thermodynamics satisfying a holographic distribution .",
    "therefore , the number of degrees of freedom on this holographic screen is proportional to its area which takes @xmath10 . in this case",
    ", the classical holographic entropy on this screen is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the radius location of the boundary surface .",
    "the entropic force is determined by the variation of energy with respect to the radius , @xmath13 in which @xmath14 is the temperature of the boundary system and we have applied eq .",
    "( [ sb ] ) in the above formula . according to the unruh effect , when a test particle with mass @xmath15 is located near by the horizon , the variation of the entropy on this horizon with respect to the radius takes the form of @xmath16 and thus the combination of eqs .",
    "( [ fe ] ) and ( [ unruh ] ) yields an entropic acceleration @xmath17 as follows , @xmath18 the corresponding entropic pressure takes a negative form @xmath19 , and so is expected to drive the current acceleration of our universe .",
    "now we apply the above results into a homogeneous and isotropic flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe described by @xmath20 and the einstein field equation gives the acceleration equation for the scale factor as follows , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a length scale relevant to the location of the holographic screen , of which a natural choice is to near by the hubble horizon which will constrained by cosmological observations . ]",
    "@xmath23 with the horizon temperature being @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the hubble parameter of the universe .",
    "finally , we arrive at a modified friedmann acceleration equation as follows , @xmath26 from this equation we can learn that , if the coefficient @xmath27 is of order @xmath28 , the friedmann equations describing the evolution of our universe would be changed too much by taking into account such a holographic screen , which is hardly able to recover the usual form in radiation and matter dominated periods",
    ". this point also appeared in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the authors of that paper suggest to modify the coefficients before the temperature and introduce an alternative entropic acceleration .",
    "the key reason leading to the above over - modified friedmann equation is that in this gravitational system we have only considered a single holographic screen related to the hubble horizon . in this case",
    ", there exists a temperature gap between the bulk universe ( cmb temperature ) and the horizon , which indicates that the whole gravitational system is not in thermal equilibrium and all the particles in the bulk universe will fall down onto the horizon due to such an unbalanced effect .",
    "in such a cosmological system , one another holographic screen ought to be taken into account , i.e. , the schwarzschild horizon .",
    "this horizon is motivated by physics of black holes , which is another promising approach to understanding the quantum information of einstein s gravity .",
    "a black hole has many remarkable properties , namely , the association with thermodynamics and the reflection of holography introduced at the beginning of the current letter .",
    "the simplest black hole solution in four dimensions corresponds to a schwarzschild spacetime discovered many years ago . in this solution ,",
    "the whole geometry is divided into two causal independent regions by an event horizon at the radius @xmath29 its corresponding temperature is given by @xmath30 and therefore , according to the relationship obtained in eq .",
    "( [ ae ] ) , we obtain a modified entropic acceleration @xmath31 which reflects a competition of entropic effects from the outer horizon and the inner horizon .",
    "interestingly , if these two holographic screens are delicately on thermal equilibrium with @xmath32 and we choose the coefficient @xmath33 , one can recover the exact form of the traditional friedmann equation @xmath34 which coincides with the normal friedmann equation . in this case one can check the schwarzschild radius is smaller than the hubble radius .",
    "moreover , the continuous equation for matter fields in the bulk spacetime satisfies @xmath35 when there is no coupling to the boundary surfaces .",
    "these two equations of motion are self - complete and yields the normal evolution of our universe .        in the following",
    "we depict this holographic picture with a cartoon sketch as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] . in this figure",
    ", one can see that any matter fields in the bulk spacetime would feel two different entropic forces of which the directions are opposite .",
    "therefore , the energy stored in the bulk spacetime will transfer to the holographic screen with lower temperature until two temperatures equal to each other .",
    "once @xmath32 , the universe will arrive at a delicate balanced state and evolves according to its own equations of motion without energy exchanges among these screens .",
    "additionally , during the whole evolution of the universe the second law of thermodynamics is preserved .      up to now",
    ", we have studied the holographic description of an frw universe with double screens in classical level .",
    "however , it has been studied for many years in the field of quantum einstein gravity and string theory that , the form of a holographic entropy should be improved when higher order quantum corrections are taken into account@xcite .",
    "namely , both the number of string states@xcite and the holographic renormalization group flow@xcite yields an improved form of the entropy with leading order corrections as follows , @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the inner and outer horizon respectively . in the above formula , the coefficient @xmath38 is determined by specific environment and here we would like to leave it as a free parameter .    in this case , the entropy force of a holographic screen is changed to be @xmath39 at leading order . with double holographic screens ,",
    "we obtain an improved acceleration equation , which is expressed as @xmath40 with the form of surface function being @xmath41      in the physics of quantum gravity , there is an important lesson from holography , i.e. , when there exists hawking radiation , the boundary horizon loses a small amount of its energy@xcite .",
    "this can be achieved similar to the well - known studies of a massive primordial black hole@xcite ( see the recent study @xcite ) . in a generic cosmological background",
    ", its dissipating equation is given by@xcite , @xmath42 here the @xmath43 term describes the evolution of the schwarzschild horizon via hawking radiation , and so @xmath44 .",
    "moveover , the @xmath45 term denotes the accretion process and the value of @xmath45 is determined by the background cosmological evolution at initial moment , which in a usual case corresponds to a critical point @xmath46 when the whole system is on the thermal equilibrium and the standard friedmann equation is recovered .",
    "thus one gets @xmath47 .    the dissipating equation ( [ dissipate ] ) can not be solved in an analytic approach .",
    "however , one may notice that , for such a horizon evolving at late time of the universe , the @xmath45 term is strongly suppressed by the age of our universe . as a consequence , one can solve the dissipating equation and obtain an evaporation time of the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the schwarzschild mass at the critical moment .",
    "from this relation , we find that in order to let the age of such a schwarzschild horizon in the order of our universe , there has to be @xmath50 at the critical moment .",
    "we leave the explicit values of the coefficients to be determined or constrained by astronomical observations which will be discussed later .",
    "note that if this horizon has not evaporated out completely until today , in principle it could be expected to be observable by cmb experiments .",
    "namely , the radiation arising from the evaporation of the inner horizon could bring an amplification of cmb spectrum at sub - hubble scales .",
    "this issue deserves a study in detail in the future@xcite .",
    "in addition , we would like to comment on the quantum decay of the outer horizon . since this horizon is similar to the event horizon of the ds spacetime , according to the work of coleman and de luccia@xcite , the decay time of a meta - stable ds vacuum has an approximate expression @xmath51 . by neglecting all the sub - exponential factors",
    ", we have @xmath52 which is exponentially suppressed by the age of the universe .",
    "therefore , we can neglect the radiation emission of the outside horizon throughout the whole cosmological evolution .",
    "we now study the cosmological implications of double holographic screens . specifically , we discuss realizations of the late - time acceleration and entropic evolution of early time universe respectively .",
    "we find there might be a potential way to unify these two processes together in the frame of entropic cosmology .",
    "according to the well - known knowledge of thermodynamics , a system usually evolves from an unstable state to the equilibrium .",
    "this process is described by a generalized acceleration equation appeared in eq .",
    "( [ hfrw1 ] ) , but we still need one another equation of motion to solve this system self - complete .",
    "we consider the conservation of the whole energy in this system , which sums up the contributions from the double holographic horizons and the universe , which can be described by . ]",
    "@xmath53 where @xmath54 for @xmath37 respectively .",
    "this yields an improved continuous equation @xmath55 with an effective coupling term @xmath56 being @xmath57 in classical level .",
    "one can check when @xmath33 and @xmath32 , the coupling @xmath56 vanishes and eq .",
    "( [ hfrw2 ] ) is in agreement with the normal continuous equation ( [ frw2 ] ) .",
    "consider a radiation dominated universe at high energy scales .",
    "we assume the equation of state for the radiation in the universe is determined by its intrinsic physical nature which gives @xmath58 . to combine the equations of motion ( [ hfrw1 ] ) and ( [ hfrw2 ] ) and only keep the leading order quantum correction to the entropy , one can approximately solve out the following solution for the hubble parameter @xmath59~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at early universe . during the semi - analytical derivation , we find again that @xmath60 is required to be @xmath61 approximately in order to make sure the above calculation self - consistent , which indicates the system would approach to the thermal equilibrium state along with the cosmological evolution .    from eq .",
    "( [ hfrw ] ) , one can see that a standard friedmann equation can be achieved if @xmath62 even without a thermal equilibrium at early times .",
    "there exist two branches of cosmological solutions at high energy scales .",
    "the first one describes an expanding universe with @xmath63 , and the hubble parameter is proportional to the energy density at high energy scales . in this branch",
    "the @xmath64 term could make the early time inflation much easier be realized , so would provide an implement of holographic inflation as studied in @xcite . in the following",
    "we will illustrate its possibility in the example of a radiation dominated universe .    in the case of @xmath65 , the hubble parameter will be dominated by the second term in the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ hfrw ] ) when the energy density of the universe reaches a critical value @xmath66 for a radiation dominated entropic universe .",

    "consequently , we obtain a period of holographic inflation .",
    "note that , if we assume the critical scale obtained above corresponds to the critical mass appeared in eq .",
    "( [ taus ] ) , it requires @xmath75 to be around or less than @xmath76 with @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , in order to let the inner horizon evaporate within the age of our universe , one expects that the value of @xmath78 should be finely tuned as large as @xmath79 . as an explicit example , we choose @xmath80 and thus get the efolding number @xmath81 where we introduce the planck time @xmath82 .",
    "we plot the evolution of the hubble parameter @xmath83 and the slow - roll parameter @xmath72 as functions of the efolding number @xmath84 in figs .",
    "[ fig : hubble ] and [ fig : slow ] . from these figures",
    ", one can read that for @xmath85 there is @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",

    "the second branch corresponds to the case of @xmath91 . in this case",
    "we expect there exists a cosmological bouncing solution which may avoid the initial singularity .",
    "since this topic is beyond the aim of the current letter , we would like to leave it in future studies .",
    "along with the decreasing energy scale , the universe will gracefully exit from a primordial epoch either a normal expansion or a holographic inflation , and then smoothly link with the standard thermal history as we observed . during this period ,",
    "our universe has already arrived at the delicate thermal balanced state with its evolution satisfying the standard friedmann equation . however , as mentioned in the above section , one should take into account the horizon evaporation via hawking radiation .",
    "therefore , the double holographic screens can also lead to the late - time acceleration of the universe once the inner horizon evaporates .",
    "the late - time acceleration can be realized via the equation of motion ( [ hfrw1 ] ) where the form of @xmath92 approximately takes @xmath93 which coincides with the result obtained in ref .",
    "however , we leave the coefficient @xmath60 to be a free parameter due to lacks of detailed information of the inner horizon evaporation . in principle",

    "this signature is understandable since at high redshift regime the universe still satisfies the standard friedmann equation and the double holographic screens are on thermal equilibrium as well .",
