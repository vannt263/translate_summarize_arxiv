    "spiral galaxies generally possess large - scale magnetic fields ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these magnetic fields are usually considered to be amplified and maintained by large - scale dynamo action driven by collective inductive effects of turbulence and differential rotation @xcite . in our galaxy ,",
    "the strength of the magnetic field is about a few @xmath1 g. inside 200pc from the galactic center , however , radio observations indicate that magnetic fields are as strong as a few mg ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recent observations of other spiral galaxies indicate that the typical averaged equipartition strength of the total magnetic fields is about @xmath2 g @xcite .    based on a survey for the molecular gas in the galaxy by nanten ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "the total mass of the molecular gas estimated from the observation is about @xmath4 when lte at 50k was assumed at a distance of 8.5 kpc .",
    "the kinetic energy of the loops estimated from their line - of - sight velocity gradient exceeds @xmath5 ergs .",
    "this energy exceeds the energy injected by a supernova and requires other energetic mechanisms driving the molecular gas .",
    "the velocity gradient along the loops and large velocity dispersions at their foot - points are typical features of solar magnetic loops emerging from below the photosphere .",
    "the emergence of solar magnetic loops from the photosphere to the corona is driven by the buoyancy created by sliding the gas along the loop . even when the unperturbed atmosphere is convectively stable",
    ", the magnetic loop can rise when the buoyancy at the loop top exceeds the restoring magnetic tension .",
    "this instability is called the parker instability .",
    "parker instability was originally proposed as a mechanism of the formation of the interstellar clouds @xcite .",
    "@xcite carried out two - dimensional magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations of the parker instability in astrophysical disks and showed that in the nonlinear stage of the parker instability , shock waves are formed near the foot - points of the magnetic loops because gas slides down supersonically(e.g . , @xcite ) .",
    "such shocks can be an origin of large velocity dispersions observed near the foot - points of galactic center molecular loops @xcite .",
    "two - dimensional mhd simulations of the parker instability in the cartesian coordinate system of the gas disk can reproduce loop - like structures and velocity gradients similar to the observed loops @xcite . in their simulations",
    ", however , the galactic rotation was not taken into account . in rotating stratified magnetized layer such as galactic gas disk ,",
    "coriolis force twists the magnetic loops .",
    "since the twisting of magnetic fields enhances magnetic tension , the growth rate of the parker instability is suppressed .",
    "@xcite carried out local three - dimensional mhd simulations of the parker instability by using a frame corotating with the disk to consider the effect of the coriolis force .",
    "they confirmed that the parker instability grows in rotating disks , although growth rate becomes smaller than that without rotation .    in the gas disk rotating",
    "differentially , another instability , magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) grows @xcite .",
    "three - dimensional local 3d mhd simulations adopting the shearing sheet approximation confirmed that mri drives magnetic turbulence inside the disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "when we take into account the vertical gravity , buoyantly rising magnetic loops can be formed by the parker instability . in the galactic center region , since the loop size must be comparable to the distance from the galactic center , non - local effects such as curvature becomes important .",
    "global mhd simulations of the buoyant rise of magnetic loops from differentially rotating gas disks were first carried out by @xcite .",
    "they showed that magnetic loops emerge from the turbulent disk .",
    "they assumed the gravitational force created by the central point mass . in galactic gas disks , however , gravity is determined by stars and the dark matter .",
    "@xcite presented the results of global three - dimensional mhd simulations of galactic gaseous disks to study how the galactic magnetic fields are amplified and maintained .",
    "they assumed a steady axisymmetric gravitational potential given by @xcite .",
    "their simulations showed that magnetic fields are amplified up to @xmath1 g and are maintained for 10 billion years .",
    "they also found that mean azimuthal magnetic fields reverse their direction in every 1gyr .",
    "this field reversal is driven by the buoyant escape of magnetic flux from the disk to the galactic halo .",
    "their simulation region ( @xmath6 ) , however , did not include the galactic center . here , @xmath7 is the distance from the galactic center .",
    "@xcite proposed that collision of the high velocity cloud with the galactic disk explains the formation of the molecular loop structure seen at the galactic center , when the high velocity cloud has an oblique collision with the disk plane .",
    "they showed that the size was similar to that of the molecular loop , but the velocity gradient was smaller than that of the observation .    in this paper",

    "<S> the gravitational potential is approximated by the axisymmetric potential proposed by @xcite . at the initial state </S>",
    "<S> , we assume a warm ( @xmath0 ) gas torus threaded by azimuthal magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> self - gravity and radiative cooling of the gas are ignored . </S>",
    "<S> we found that buoyantly rising magnetic loops are formed above the differentially rotating , magnetically turbulent disk . by analyzing the results of global mhd simulations , </S>",
    "<S> we have identified individual loops , about 180 in the upper half of the disk , and studied their statistical properties such as their length , width , height , and velocity distributions along the loops . typical length and height of a loop are 1kpc and 200pc , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the line of sight velocity changes linearly along a loop and shows large dispersions around the foot - points . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results indicate that loops emerge preferentially from the region where magnetic pressure is large . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that these properties are consistent with those of the molecular loops discovered by nanten . </S>"
