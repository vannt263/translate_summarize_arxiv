    "the spreading of gaussian wave packets is a standard topic discussed in almost any textbook on quantum mechanics . while there still are interesting investigations and applications of wave packet dynamics @xcite ,",
    "it may seem unlikely that anything new can be said theoretically about a topic as elementary as this . indeed , some of the results that will be presented below have been discussed before .",
    "still , to the best of our knowledge , most of our results , although easy to derive , are new and seem to have escaped the attention of quantum physicists .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to present a general discussion of wave packet spreading , which generalizes the standard gaussian wave packet describing a free non - relativistic particle to other minimal position - velocity uncertainty wave packets with a general energy - momentum dispersion relation @xmath0 .",
    "as was first discussed by ehrenfest @xcite , a free non - relativistic particle moving in one spatial dimension shows the following time - dependence of the position expectation value @xmath7 where @xmath1 is the corresponding velocity .",
    "it is easy to show that this relation holds for any ( relativistic or non - relativistic ) dispersion relation @xmath0 .",
    "similarly , one can show that the position uncertainty @xmath8 varies as @xmath9 t + ( \\delta v)^2 \\ t^2.\\ ] ] this implies that the asymptotic speed of spreading for general wave packets is given by @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , if position and velocity are correlated such that initially @xmath11 , the wave packet is shrinking before it begins to spread .",
    "it is interesting to investigate wave packets of minimal position - velocity uncertainty product @xmath12 .",
    "putting @xmath13 , one easily derives the generalized position - velocity uncertainty relation @xmath14 which is valid for any dispersion relation , and which reduces to the standard heisenberg uncertainty relation @xmath15 for a non - relativistic particle with energy @xmath4 . for a particle hopping between neighboring sites on a lattice with spacing @xmath16 ,",
    "the dispersion relation is @xmath17 and the uncertainty relation then takes the form @xmath18 on the other hand , ( also putting @xmath19 ) for a relativistic particle with @xmath6 the uncertainty relation reduces to @xmath20 for a general dispersion relation , minimal uncertainty wave packets @xmath21 saturate the inequality eq.([uncertainty ] ) and obey the equation @xmath22 with @xmath23 in momentum space , they take the form @xmath24 in this paper , minimal uncertainty wave packets are constructed explicitly and their time - evolution is calculated analytically , both for the lattice and for the relativistic dispersion relation .",
    "several results of this paper belong to relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "it should be noted that both the dirac and the klein - gordon equation belong to quantum field theory and not to relativistic quantum mechanics . in particular , it is well - known that , due to the existence of negative energy solutions , a purely quantum mechanical single particle interpretation of these equations leads to problems such as the klein paradox .",
    "when we discuss the relativistic quantum mechanics of a single free particle , we consider the hamiltonian @xmath25 which only has positive energy solutions . while we know that the correct description of nature at the most fundamental level accessible today is provided by the standard model of particle physics",
    " which is a relativistic quantum field theory  there is nothing wrong with studying the hamiltonian of eq.([relh ] ) . in particular , while the corresponding square root would conflict with locality in quantum field theory , it is perfectly acceptable in the framework of single particle quantum mechanics .",
    "in fact , as will be discussed in appendix b , the above hamiltonian correctly describes the single particle states of a free scalar quantum field theory . as borne out by the reeh - schlieder theorem @xcite ,",
    "the localization of particles is a subtle issue in quantum field theory .",
    "the interpretation of the results obtained in relativistic quantum mechanics must take this into account .",
    "in particular , apparent violations of einstein causality in relativistic quantum mechanics turn out to be unproblematical when viewed from this perspective @xcite .",
    "in contrast to quantum field theory , relativistic quantum mechanics ( as characterized above ) seems not to be a well - studied subject .",
    "this is a pity , because relativistic quantum mechanics may help to bridge the large gap between non - relativistic quantum mechanics and relativistic quantum field theory that makes learning the latter rather non - trivial . also for pedagogical reasons",
    ", it thus seems worthwhile to study relativistic quantum mechanics  even of just a single particle . due to lorentz invariance",
    ", the possible interactions in relativistic quantum mechanics are highly constrained .",
    "in particular , if one attempts to include interactions only in the hamiltonian and in the boost operator ( but not in the momentum or angular momentum operators ) of a multi - particle system , at the classical level leutwyler has proved that only the free theory is consistent with lorentz invariance @xcite . the same was first shown for two particles by currie , jordan , and sudarshan @xcite . by including the interaction in the momentum ( and not in the boost operator ) , interesting relativistic systems with a fixed number of interacting particles have been constructed and investigated in detail @xcite . here",
    "we concentrate on wave packet spreading of a single free relativistic particle .",
    "although in this paper we do not focus on applications , the resulting expressions may be useful in studies of neutrino wave packets @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we also consider the spreading of wave packets in an expanding universe .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "the time - dependence of position expectation values is considered for a general dispersion relation , the corresponding position - velocity uncertainty relation is derived , and the general minimal uncertainty wave packet is constructed .",
    "section 3 investigates wave packet spreading in the non - relativistic case , both in the continuum and for a lattice dispersion relation .",
    "the spreading of minimal position - velocity uncertainty wave packets for a free relativistic particle is discussed in detail in section 4 .",
    "section 5 extends the discussion to wave packets propagating in an expanding universe .",
    "finally , section 6 contains our conclusions .",
    "some non - trivial expectation values are evaluated in appendix a. the relation of relativistic quantum mechanics to quantum field theory and the related issues of particle localization are reviewed in appendix b.",
    "in this section we investigate general properties of spreading wave packets .",
    "we also derive a position - velocity uncertainty relation and we consider wave packets with a minimal position - velocity uncertainty product . while the results presented in this section are quite elementary , except for those in subsection 2.1 , we have not been able to locate them in the physics literature .",
    "although it seems likely that some of the material has been discussed elsewhere , it seems not to be well - known and may thus be worth studying in some detail .",

    "asymptotically , for large times the packet is spreading with the velocity @xmath37 , i.e.  the velocity uncertainty determines the velocity of spreading .",
    "the time - dependence of moments of the position operator is well - known @xcite and has also been considered , for example , in @xcite .",
    "as we have just seen , the spreading of general wave packets is controlled by the uncertainties @xmath38 and @xmath37 of position and velocity .",
    "this suggests to consider packets with a minimal position - velocity uncertainty product .",
    "before we construct such wave packets , let us derive a generalization of the non - relativistic heisenberg uncertainty relation @xmath39 to an arbitrary dispersion relation @xmath0 with velocity @xmath1 .",
    "for this purpose , we define the operator @xmath40 ( with @xmath41 and @xmath42 as arbitrary adjustable parameters ) and we evaluate @xmath43 - i ( \\beta - \\beta^ * ) x - \\alpha ( \\beta + \\beta^ * ) v \\rangle \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\langle x^2 \\rangle + \\alpha^2 \\langle v^2 \\rangle + \\beta_r^2 + \\beta_i^2 - \\alpha \\left\\langle { \\partial}_p^2 e \\right\\rangle +   2 \\beta_i \\langle x \\rangle - 2 \\alpha \\beta_r \\langle v \\rangle \\geq 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by construction @xmath44 . in order to obtain the most stringent bound",

    "it is straightforward to show that for a wave packet with minimal position - velocity uncertainty the initial position - velocity correlation vanishes , i.e.   @xmath59 .",
    "the general formula eq.([spreading ] ) describing wave packet spreading then reduces to @xmath60 since for a free particle @xmath61 and @xmath62 are time - independent , a wave packet that initially has a minimal position - velocity uncertainty will obviously not maintain a minimal uncertainty product as time evolves .",

    "exactly the same behavior also arises in quantum field theory .",
    "indeed , when we form single particle wave packets in the scalar field theory , they behave exactly as the ones in relativistic quantum mechanics that were considered in section 4 .    in contrast to relativistic quantum mechanics ,",
    "relativistic quantum field theory is based on the principle of locality .",
    "hence , by construction , causality can not be violated . indeed , as we will now see , the apparent violation of causality observed in wave packet spreading is due to the fact that single particle states can not be localized in a finite region .",
    "this is a consequence of the reeh - schlieder theorem @xcite .",
    "the issues of particle localization have already been discussed by newton and wigner in 1949 @xcite , have been investigated further , for example , in @xcite , and continue to be a subject of controversial discussions @xcite .",
    "we notice that the operator @xmath258 \\exp(-i p x),\\ ] ] is not localized at @xmath169 , but is instead non - local .",
    "in fact , the single particle position eigenstate @xmath259 can not be created from the vacuum by an application of the field operators @xmath241 and @xmath242 and their derivatives at the point @xmath169 .",
    "consequently , in quantum field theory single particles are inherently non - local objects . in non - relativistic quantum mechanics",
    "such subtleties do not arise and one interprets the state @xmath259 as describing a single particle completely localized at the point @xmath169 .",
    "when we do the same in relativistic quantum mechanics , we encounter an apparent violation of causality @xcite . as the discussion of field theory shows , causality is not really violated , since the particle itself is a non - local object .",
    "this should be kept in mind when one interprets the results obtained in the framework of relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "consequently , the state @xmath259 should not be viewed as describing a particle localized at the point @xmath169 , but should be associated with the corresponding state in quantum field theory which is not localized .",
