    "excesses in searching for diboson resonance using boson - tagged jets were recently reported by the atlas collaboration  @xcite .",
    "it shows local excesses in the @xmath4 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 channels with significance of @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "similarly , the cms collaboration  @xcite has reported an excess of @xmath8 significance in the dijet resonance channel and @xmath9 channel which may arise from @xmath10 with @xmath11 decaying hadronically .",
    "these excesses may be evidences of new symmetries or new particles near @xmath12 .",
    "since the resonances decay into two gauge boson , they should be bosonic states . possible origins of this excess were studied by several groups  @xcite , where the excesses were explained as spin-1 gauge bosons  @xcite in an extended gauge group , composite spin-1 resonances  @xcite , spin-0 or spin-2 composite particles  @xcite and extra scalar bosons  @xcite .",
    "the key points in explaining the excesses are the interactions of new resonance with the standard model ( sm ) gauge bosons , quarks and(or ) gluons , the former of which is relevant to the branching ratio of the new resonance and the latter of which is relevant to the production of the new resonance at the lhc .",
    "one the one hand , one needs the couplings of new interactions to be large enough so as to give rise to a sizable production cross section at the lhc , on the other hand the strengths of these interactions should be consistent with current constraints of colliders and electroweak precision measurements .",
    "these two requirements are mutual restraint .",
    "a new resonance is not able to explain the atlas excesses if its interaction strengths are not mutually compatible with these two requirements .    in this paper , we explain the atlas excesses in the stealth doublet model , where the second higgs doublet , @xmath13 , gets no vacuum expectation value , with mass near 2 tev , and only the cp - even part of @xmath13 mixes with the sm higgs boson .",
    "we assume @xmath13 has sizable yukawa interaction with the first generation quarks , which is consistent with constraints of flavor physics .",
    "such that the heavy cp - even higgs boson can be produced at the lhc via the yukawa interaction and decays into diboson states through the mixing with the sm higgs boson .",
    "our numerical simulations show that one has @xmath14 by setting @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the yukawa coupling of the @xmath13 with the first generation quarks and @xmath18 is the mixing angle between two cp - even neutral states .",
    "this result is consistent with current constraints from colliders and electroweak precision measurements .",
    "the remaining of the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we give a brief introduction to the model .",
    "section iii is the study of constraints on the model .",
    "we investigate the atlas diboson excesses arising from this stealth doublet model in section iv .",
    "the last part is the concluding remarks .",
    "we work in the modified stealth doublet model  @xcite , where the second higgs doublet gets no vacuum expectation value ( vev ) but its cp - even part mixes with the sm higgs boson . in the following , we describe the modified stealth doublet model first , and then study its implications in the atlas diboson excesses .",
    "the higgs potential is the same as that in the general two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) , which can be written as @xmath19 in this paper , we assume the higgs potential is cp - conserving , so all couplings in eq.([potential ] ) are real .",
    "only one higgs doublet gets nonzero vev in the stealth doublet model , we take it be @xmath20 .",
    "the tadpole conditions for the electroweak symmetry breaking become @xmath21 where @xmath22 . after spontaneous breaking of the electroweak symmetry , there are two cp - even scalars @xmath11 and @xmath23 , one cp - odd scalar @xmath24 and two charged scalars @xmath25 , the mass eigenvalues of which can be written as  @xcite @xmath26 the mixing angle @xmath18 between @xmath11 and @xmath23 can be calculated directly , we take it as a new degree of freedom in this paper . @xmath23",

    "the yukawa interactions of @xmath20 with sm fermions are exactly the same as yukawa interactions of the sm higgs with fermions in the sm .",
    "we assume @xmath13 has sizable yukawa coupling with the first generation quarks : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "since @xmath30 , there is almost no constraint on this yukawa coupling , and @xmath23 can be produced at the lhc via this interaction .",
