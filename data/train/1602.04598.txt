    "the bondi solution of accretion on a point mass ( bondi 1952 ) , due to its inherent simplicity , is a standard tool for the interpretation of observations of the accretion phenomenon , and the starting point for the development of recipes for the mass accretion rate , to be adopted for example in semi - analytical models and numerical simulations that lack the resolution to study gas transport down to parsec scale . in cosmological simulations and semi - analytical models of the early growth of massive black holes ( hereafter mbhs ) , and of the co - evolution of mbhs and their host galaxies , the bondi accretion rate is used to link the mass supply to the accretion disks surrounding mbhs with the density and temperature of their environment ( e.g. , fabian & rees 1995 , volonteri & rees 2005 , di matteo et al . 2005 , hopkins et al .",

    "2015 , degraf et al .",
    "2015 , curtis & sijacki 2015 ) .",
    "another important application of the classical bondi model is to estimate the mass accretion rate on mbhs at the center of galaxies , by using observed values of the gas density and temperature in the vicinity of the mbh ( e.g. , loewenstein et al .",
    "2001 ; baganoff et al .",
    "2003 , pellegrini 2005 , 2010 ; allen et al . 2006 ; rafferty et al . 2006 ; mcnamara et al . 2011 ; wong et al . 2014 ; russell et al .",
    "in this view , one assumes that these values represent the true boundary conditions ( i.e. , at infinity ) for the bondi problem ( see quataert & narayan 2000 ) .",
    "however , it is recognized that even the knowledge of the true boundary conditions would not be enough for a proper treatment of mass accretion on mbhs at the center of galaxies : first , because the mbh is not isolated , being at the bottom of the host galaxy potential well ; second , because the radiation emitted by the inflowing material interacts with the material itself , with the consequent establishment of unsteady accretion ( for luminosities of the order of @xmath0 or greater , where @xmath1 is the eddington luminosity ; e.g. , cowie et al . 1978 ) ; and finally , because the flow also gets mass and energy from the inputs due to stellar evolution ( e.g. , ciotti et al . 1991 ) .",
    "when the last two of the above circumstances are important , bondi accretion can not be applied ; during phases of moderate accretion , instaed , the problem can be considered almost steady , so that bondi accretion can be considered a first , reliable approximation of the real situation .    in this paper",
    "we present a quantification of the bias on the estimates of the bondi radius and mass accretion rate , that is introduced when adopting as boundary values for the density and temperature those at arbitrary but finite distances from the mbhs .",
    "first we derive the exact formulae for this bias , in case of radiation pressure due to electron scattering , and of the additional gravitational potential of a galaxy ; we also derive the asymptotic expansion of these formulae close to the mbh .",
    "these formulae contain a critical accretion parameter , that in general can be determined only numerically .",
    "then , we present a technique to obtain the analytical expressions for the critical accretion parameter , in some special cases . a full analytical discussion of the critical points is presented for a hernquist galaxy model .",
    "we finally solve numerically the bondi problem for a mbh at the center of a galaxy , and including the effect of radiation pressure due to electron scattering , and compare the numerical results with the analytical ones .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "in section 2 we recall the main properties of the classical bondi solution , and we present a preliminary analysis of the mass accretion bias introduced by considering as boundary values for the density and temperature those at points along the solution at finite distance from the mbh . in section 3",
    "we add to the bondi solution , in a self - consistent way , the effect of electron scattering , and in section 4 we consider the full case of the bondi solution in presence of radiation feedback and a galaxy potential . in section 5 the particular case of a hernquist galaxy is presented , building numerically the accretion solution , and also providing a full analytical discussion of the problem . for all these cases",
    "we derive the formulae that allow to recover the true accretion rate from fiducial estimates of the bondi radius and accretion rate obtained by assuming classical bondi accretion .",
    "the main conclusions are summarized in section 6 .",
    "finally , three appendixes contain technical details and relevant formulae useful in analytical and numerical studies .",
    "as the present investigation builds on the classical bondi ( 1952 ) accretion model , it is useful to recall its main properties .",
    "the classical bondi theory describes spherically - symmetric , steady accretion of a spatially infinite gas distribution onto an isolated central mass , in our case a mbh , of mass @xmath2 .",
    "the self - gravity , angular momentum and viscosity of the accreting gas , as well as magnetic fields and feedback phenomena , are not considered .",
    "the gas is taken to be perfect , and subject to polytropic transformations ; thus its pressure ( @xmath3 ) and density ( @xmath4 ) are related by : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the polytropic index , @xmath7 is the proton mass , @xmath8 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath9 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are respectively the gas pressure and the density at infinity .",
    "the polytropic gas sound speed is @xmath12 note that @xmath13 is not necessarily the adiabatic index , so that in the bondi theory the entropy of the gas can change along the radial streamlines ( in fact , polytropic transformations have a constant specific heat , e.g. , chandrasekhar 1939 ) , and in principle , once the solution is known , one could compute the heat balance of each fluid element as it moves toward the mbh , adiabatic index @xmath14 , and specific heat at constant volume @xmath15 , the molar specific heat is @xmath16 . therefore , when @xmath17 , a fluid element loses energy as it moves inward and heats . ] .    in spherical symmetry the time - independent continuity equation",

    "a scale length of fundamental importance for the problem , the so - called bondi radius , is naturally defined as appears in the numerator of the definition of the bondi radius . ]",

    "we do not enter in the details of the solutions ( see , e.g. , bondi 1952 ; frank , king & raine 1992 ; krolik 1998 ) and , as common in similar studies , we restrict to the critical case @xmath63 ; in this case , @xmath64 is also the sonic radius . among the two critical solutions , we consider that with increasing mach number approaching the center . in the following , the function @xmath40 in eqs .",

    "we provide the formulae for the true mass accretion rate , together with its estimates obtained using values of density and temperature at any radius @xmath65 along the ( new ) solution , while assuming classical bondi accretion .",
    "the critical solutions for each case are constructed with the aid of a numerical code built on purpose : we first determined numerically the position and the value of the absolute minimum of @xmath66 ( sects . 4 and 5 ) , and , after having determined @xmath59 , we evaluated the solution over the whole radial range .      here",
    "we introduce the general procedure that will be considered in the next sections to estimate the bondi radius and mass accretion rate , for the basic case of the classical bondi solution . to keep the notation simple , in the following we use the symbol @xmath67 to indicate the critical value @xmath59 .",
    "later we will use the same procedure after having included in the problem the effects of radiation pressure due to electron scattering ( sect .",

    "the overestimate of @xmath20 is significant .",
    "the numerical results in fig .",

    "( 22)-(23 ) ( not shown in this figure for clarity ; but see the following fig .",
    "as well known , the bondi solution is a purely hydrodynamical flow , where heat exchanges are implicitly described by the polytropic index .",
    "therefore , for given polytropic index , and in absence of shock waves ( as for example in the transition from subsonic to supersonic regime for the subcritical @xmath112 case ) , one could follow the entropy evolution of each fluid element along the radial streamline , and determine the reversible heat exchanges",
    ". however , in real accretion the energetics can be dominated by the irreversible emission of energy near the mbh , that , for the radiative component , is usually expressed as @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the efficiency of the release of the accretion energy , and @xmath115 is the mass accretion rate ; in the classical bondi accretion , @xmath116 . in principle",
    "@xmath114 can depend on luminosity @xmath117 or on @xmath115 ( especially at low luminosities , as in the adaf family [ narayan & yi 1995 ] , and its variants ) . at high accretion rates ,",
    "the efficiency is of the order of @xmath118 , and the accretion is likely unsteady , so that bondi accretion can not be used ( e.g. , ciotti & ostriker 2012 for a review ) .",
    "the emitted radiation interacts with the surrounding medium and modifies the accretion process : the radiation effects can be sufficiently strong to stop accretion ( the so - called negative feedback ) , and shut - off the central agn .",
    "stationarity is almost impossible in these circumstances ( binney & tabor 1995 ; ciotti & ostriker 1997 , 2001 ; park et al . 2014 ) .",
    "however , when restricting to low accretion rates and considering only electron scattering , in the optically thin regime it is possible to generalize the classical bondi accretion solution by taking into account the radiation pressure effect ( taam , fu & fryxell 1991 ; fukue 2001 ; lusso & ciotti 2011 ) .",
    "in fact , for electron scattering in the optically thin regime and in spherical symmetry , the effective force experienced by a gas element can be written as : @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the eddington luminosity , and @xmath121@xmath122 is the thomson cross section . in the optically thin regime ,",
    "being @xmath123 independent of radius , the radiation feedback can be implemented in eq .

    "16 ) , because , as in the classical case , the relevant quantities can be obtained by taking the limit for @xmath126 of the formulae in the general polytropic case .",

    "( 29 ) can be seen as an implicit equation for @xmath132 .",
    "remarkably , this equation can be explicitly solved by introducing the eddington mass accretion rate @xmath134 in general @xmath114 depends on the accretion rate , but in the following for illustrative purposes we assume @xmath135 . from eqs .",
    "( 29)-(30 ) , one obtains explicitly @xmath136 in terms of @xmath137 , by solving the quadratic equation : @xmath138 ( see lusso & ciotti 2011 ) .",

    "<S> accretion onto central massive black holes in galaxies is often modelled with the bondi solution . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we study a generalization of the classical bondi accretion theory , considering the additional effects of the gravitational potential of the host galaxy , and of electron scattering in the optically thin limit . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a general analysis of the bias in the estimates of the bondi radius and mass accretion rate , when adopting as fiducial values for the density and temperature at infinity the values of these quantities measured at finite distance from the central black hole . </S>",
    "<S> we also give general formulae to compute the correction terms of the critical accretion parameter in relevant asymptotic regimes . </S>",
    "<S> a full analytical discussion is presented in the case of an hernquist galaxy , when the problem reduces to the discussion of a cubic equation , therefore allowing for more than one critical point in the accretion structure . </S>",
    "<S> the results are useful for observational works ( especially in the case of low - luminosity systems ) , as well as for numerical simulations , where accretion rates are usually defined in terms of the gas properties near the black hole .    </S>",
