    "there are various classes of fluids whose structural and thermodynamical properties are strongly influenced by the presence of either magnetic or electric dipolar interactions between their constituents : polar molecular liquids , dipolar liquid crystals , ferrofluids , and magneto- or electrorheological fluids .",
    "these systems respond to external electric or magnetic fields and some may even exhibit long - ranged spontaneous orientational order in the liquid phases .",
    "the strongly anisotropic and long - ranged character of the dipolar forces causes particular difficulties for the theoretical description of these systems . by using simulations , integral equation theories , density functional theories , and phenomenological approaches",
    "significant progress has been achieved in understanding one - component dipolar fluids ( see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and @xcite and references therein ) albeit several aspects remain still under debate @xcite .    if isotropic phases of dipolar fluids form interfaces ( such as liquid - vapor or fluid - wall interfaces ) the broken translational invariance gives rise to interesting local orientational order tied to the interface @xcite . recently such orientational profiles have become experimentally accessible through ellipsometry @xcite . in these experiments the orientational order at ( critical ) liquid - liquid @xcite and at ( noncritical ) fluid - vapor @xcite interfaces of several binary mixtures of polar ( a ) and nonpolar ( b )",
    "components have been studied .",
    "in particular the growing spatial extension of orientational order normal to the interface and proportional to the bulk correlation length upon approaching the continuous demixing transition of a - rich and b - rich phases in the bulk has been analysed .",
    "these data have been discussed in terms of universal scaling functions .",
    "various forms of their shape have been proposed @xcite , including the occurrence of a surface correlation length different from the bulk correlation length @xcite .",
    "these surprising interpretations lack systematic theoretical analyses , which are particularly important because the ellipsometry data provide only indirect access to orientational profiles so that theoretical guidance is required .",
    "it is our goal to provide such systematic theoretical studies for the aforementioned interfacial phenomena near continuous demixing and to extend them to wetting phenomena . as a necessary first step the present work aims at providing an overview of the global phase behavior of polar binary liquid mixtures",
    "this is an indispensable prerequisite for studying the interfacial properties in a second step .",
    "moreover , in view of the numerous interesting features even of bulk properties of dipolar fluids @xcite , the analysis of dipolar mixtures is also important in its own right .",
    "already some time ago there was an interesting first step towards the understanding of interfacial properties of dipolar liquid mixtures . in a combined experimental and theoretical study",
    "the liquid - vapor surface tensions of two polar binary liquid mixtures have been studied for various temperatures and as function of composition @xcite . using density functional theory ( dft ) also relative adsorption as well as concentration and orientational profiles",
    "have been calculated @xcite . by resorting to an improved dft",
    "it is our intention to expand the above analysis towards focusing on liquid - liquid demixing transitions , the formation of phases with long - ranged orientational order , critical phenomena , and wetting phenomena and thus reaching out to the aforementioned more recent experimental studies .",
    "there is a sizeable body of theoretical research available which is devoted to the study of bulk properties of polar liquid mixtures .",
    "this encompasses monte carlo simulations @xcite , molecular dynamics simulations @xcite , integral equations @xcite , cluster aggregation models @xcite , construction of equations of state @xcite , thermodynamic perturbation theory @xcite , structure formation in external fields @xcite , and van der waals and ising fluids @xcite .",
    "there are few theoretical studies concerning the structure formation of dipolar mixtures at interfaces such as dft and monte carlo studies at charged walls @xcite and integral equation approaches for dipolar mixtures in random confined geometries @xcite . beyond the aforementioned study in ref .",
    "@xcite the structure of dipolar mixtures at interfaces between fluid phases has been investigated by monte carlo simulations of the liquid - liquid benzene - water interface @xcite and by molecular dynamics simulations @xcite and lattice - gas models @xcite of the liquid - vapor interface of water - methanol mixtures . in the context of this body of research",
    "the present study is focused on obtaining global phase diagrams using an appropriate version of dft which opens the possibility for interfacial studies later on .",
    "models for dipolar fluids have to capture three basic features of the pair potentials between the fluid particles : short - ranged repulsion ( which in general is anisotropic reflecting molecular shapes ) , long - ranged attractive dispersion forces ( containing an omnipresent isotropic contribution @xmath0 at large distances @xmath1 between the particles plus higher order anisotropic terms ) , and the dipolar interaction @xmath2 .    as long as one is not aiming for a quantitative description of a specific system but for general phenomena and trends the so - called stockmayer model has turned out to be rather useful ( see refs . @xcite and @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it considers spherical particles interacting with lennard - jones ( lj ) potentials plus pointlike permanent dipoles at the center .",
    "such binary systems are characterized by three thermodynamic parameters ( temperature @xmath3 and two chemical potentials @xmath4 and @xmath5 for the two species @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) , three lj interaction energy parameters @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , three lj molecular diameter parameters @xmath10 , and two dipole moments @xmath11 and @xmath12 . after choosing an energy scale for @xmath13 and the @xmath14 among the @xmath8 and a length scale for the number densities among the @xmath10 one",
    "is left with a six - dimensional interaction parameter space . by using dft",
    "we analyze the three - dimensional ( @xmath15 ) phase diagrams ( where @xmath16 is the pressure of the system and @xmath17 ) as they change along certain paths within suitable subspaces of this interaction parameter space .",
    "this stockmayer model provides an approximate model for dipolar molecular fluids as well as an effective model for ferrofluids with the solvent degrees of freedom taken into account via _ effective _ interaction energies @xmath8 .",
    "ferrofluids are often polydisperse @xcite . in this respect",
    "the study of binary stockmayer models provides also insight into the effects of polydispersity for ferrofluids in the special case of bimodal distributions of their sizes or of their magnetic moments .    whereas one - component fluids with simple , radially symmetric pair potentials give rise to only two fluid phases , i.e. , liquid and vapor , binary fluids exhibit typically three fluid phases : vapor , @xmath6-rich liquid , and @xmath7-rich liquid .",
    "the latter two emerge via phase segregation from a homogeneous liquid upon lowering the temperature .",
    "there is a line of critical points ( with high temperatures ) limiting a two - dimensional sheet of first - order liquid - vapor phase transitions , a line of critical points ( at intermediate temperatures ) limiting a two - dimensional sheet of first - order demixing transitions into @xmath6-rich and @xmath7-rich liquid , and a triple line of phase coexistence between all three fluid phases formed as the intersection of the two aforementioned sheets ; at high temperatures the triple line ends at a critical end point where the line of critical demixing points meets the sheet of liquid - vapor coexistence ( see , e.g. , ref . @xcite and references therein ) . at low temperatures freezing sets in such that there the triple line ends in a tetra point where the vapor phase , @xmath6-rich liquid , @xmath7-rich liquid , and the solid phase coexist .",

    "( for freezing in one - component dipolar fluids see ref . @xcite and references therein . for quasicrystalline order and glasslike structure formation in two - dimensional binary dipolar systems",
    "see refs . @xcite . )",
    "the introduction of dipole moments shifts these phase boundaries and may even give rise to the formation of new liquid phases with spontaneous long - ranged orientational order .    in a recent series of papers @xcite range and klapp",
    "have also extended the modified mean - field density functional theory to study the phase behavior of binary dipolar mixtures . there",
    "they have focused on the investigation of the isotropic fluid ",

    ". studying dipolar hard sphere mixtures ( and briefly mentioning binary stockmayer fluid mixtures in ref .",
    "@xcite ) they have found that the isotropic fluid ",
    "ferromagnetic fluid phase transitions are shifted towards higher densities as compared with the corresponding one - component dipolar fluids .",
    "these general trends are in agreement with our findings for the corresponding phase transitions in binary stockmayer fluid mixtures . however , there are important differences to the case of dipolar hard sphere systems , because due to the additional presence of isotropic dispersion forces stockmayer fluids exhibit also a vapor phase , which is indispensable for studying the interfacial properties mentioned at the beginning of the introduction .",
    "these dispersion forces modify also the other phase transitions . therefore in the following",
