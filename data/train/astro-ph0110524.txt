    "the butcher - oemler ( bo ) effect is the first observational evidence of the evolution of cluster galaxy populations .",
    "it shows that clusters at higher redshift than 0.2 have a higher fraction of blue galaxies than that of local clusters ( butcher & oemler 1978 , 1984 ) . in the last decade , _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ images have revealed that such blue galaxies , which are recognized as bo galaxies , are predominantly normal late - type spirals ( e.g. , dressler _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ; couch _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 , 1998 ) .",
    "according to numerical and analytical studies , a dynamical interaction between a cluster and its galaxies has been proposed as a mechanism for the bo effect .",
    "because of this interaction , late - type spiral galaxies lose and/or consume their interstellar medium ( ism ) and then their star formation activity ( sfa ) is suppressed during their infall into the higher - density regions of a cluster .",
    "their color evolves redward , and the fraction of bo galaxies in the cluster decreases .",
    "( e.g. , gunn & gott 1972 ; sarazin 1986 ; kodama & bower 2001 ; abadi _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ; quilis _ et al . _ 2000 ; mori & burkert 2000 ; balogh _ et al .",
    "indeed , many observations have revealed that bo galaxies lie preferentially in the lower - density regions of clusters @xcite .",
    "thus , observational results seem consistent with the current theoretical picture .",
    "the above studies predict that there should be a difference between mean sfa of cluster galaxies and that of field galaxies at intermediate redshifts of @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , such a difference should be more evident in less - luminous ( i.e. less - massive ) galaxies whose gravitational potential wells are shallower and which are more environmentally affected .",
    "this trend , however , has not been observationally confirmed since previous papers especially focused on the morphology of galaxies at the redshifts . in this @xmath5 , we present a statistical investigation of environmental effects on sfa for less - luminous galaxies at intermediate redshifts .",
    "in addition to the dynamical interaction that is mentioned above , other effects for the bo phenomenon are also expected .",
    "the first one is a decrease of the infall - rate of galaxies into clusters with time ( e.g. , kodama & bower 2001 ) . as a second one , in this @xmath5 we propose a further possible kinematic origin for the bo effect from our new findings in observational data .",
    "this _ letter _ is organized as follows : in  2 , we present the results of our statistical analysis of a correlation between ew([oii ] ) and luminosity of cluster and field galaxies at intermediate redshifts . in  3 , we discuss sfa in less - luminous cluster galaxies , and propose an alternative cause for the bo effect . in  4 , we give our conclusions .",
    "we assume a spatially flat universe with @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8km / s / mpc .",
    "environmental effects on the sfa of galaxies can be statistically investigated with archival data . as a measure of sfa",
    ", we adopt the equivalent width ( ew ) of [ oii ] @xmath93727 .",
    "the [ oii ] emission is utilized because it is correlated to balmer - line emission that can trace current sfa @xcite .",
    "ew is used because the aperture effect can be neglected , and because it is line - luminosity normalized by luminosity of whole a galaxy .",
    "this measure permits us to discuss the specific sfa of each galaxy .    for cluster galaxies , those in the following papers",
    "are utilized : 9 morphs clusters ( @xmath10 ; @xmath11 ; dressler _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) ; cl1358 + 62 ( @xmath12 ; @xmath13 ; fisher _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) ; ac103 , ac114 , and ac118 ( @xmath14 ; @xmath11 ; couch _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) ; abell2390 ( @xmath15 ; @xmath16 ; abraham _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) ; and cnoc ( @xmath17 ; @xmath18 ; balogh _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) , where @xmath2 and @xmath19 are absolute magnitude and apparent magnitude in @xmath1-band , respectively . for field galaxies",
    ", we use cnoc ( @xmath17 ; @xmath18 ; balogh _ et al .",
    "we compile a sample of star - forming galaxies according to the following four conditions : * ( i ) * galaxies are brighter than the limiting magnitude of each catalog ; * ( ii ) * galaxies are spectroscopically selected as cluster or field galaxies according to @xcite ; * ( iii ) * the redshifts of field galaxies are within the range of @xmath20 , which corresponds to that of all the clusters ; and * ( iv ) * ew([oii ] ) of galaxies is positive .    in fig.1 , we present ew([oii ] ) and @xmath1-band absolute magnitudes for the galaxies . in panel",
    "( a ) , cluster galaxies are plotted , while field galaxies are plotted in panel ( b ) . with the same sample of fig.1",
    ", we depict the mean ew of galaxies in each magnitude bin in each environment , in panels ( a ) and ( b ) of fig.2 . from these figures",
    ", we can examine environmental effects on mean sfa .",
    "the results are more convincingly revealed in table 1 by means of welch s @xmath21-test ( press _ et al .",
    "_ 1988 ) . even when variances are not the same between two sample - groups , this test can be applied to answer the question of whether their averages are the same or not , using the @xmath21 value which is estimated as : @xmath22^{1/2 } } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , ew@xmath23 is the equivalent width of cluster galaxies in the @xmath24-th magnitude bin , ew@xmath25 that of field galaxies , var(ew ) the variance of each value , @xmath26 the number of cluster galaxies in the @xmath24-th magnitude bin , and @xmath27 that of field galaxies . in table 1 , we also give a non - parametric test , mann - whitney s",
    "@xmath28-test @xcite , to answer whether the statistically representative values of two sample - groups are same or not .",
    "the @xmath28-test is performed since our sample may not be normally distributed because of selection bias , * ( iv)*. table 1 contains the results of the @xmath21-test and @xmath28-test for all galaxies in the sample and also for galaxies with ew smaller than @xmath29 .",
    "the suffix of @xmath30 runs from the bins of more - luminous galaxies to those of less - luminous galaxies , and its maximum is adopted to be eight .    adopting a significance level of 0.05",
    ", we first conclude that * ( i ) * for less luminous galaxies with magnitudes of @xmath31 , the mean sfa of cluster galaxies is always smaller than that of field galaxies .",
    "even when we omit several galaxies whose ew is larger than 100 , our conclusion is not altered . on the assumption that luminosity is proportional to dynamical mass of a galaxy ,",
    "this result statistically confirms the expectation of almost all theoretical studies that the sfa of less - luminous cluster galaxies should suffer more suppression because of their shallower gravitational potential well ( e.g. , henriksen & byrd 1996 ; abadi _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ; quilis _ et al . _ 2000 ; mori & burkert 2000 ; balogh _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) .    as a second conclusion , while there is no theoretical prediction that less - luminous cluster galaxies keep on their sfa , we discover the following : * ( ii ) * there are some less - luminous cluster galaxies with exceptionally large sfa ( ew@xmath32 : i.e. larger than the mean ew in less - luminous , @xmath33 , field galaxies ) , which is as large as that of less - luminous but actively star - forming field galaxies .",
    "the existence of such cluster galaxies is consistent with the observational fact that bo galaxies are mostly less luminous @xcite .",
    "therefore , to argue the possibility of such exceptions , we re - examine the dynamical effects on their ism in the next section .",
    "as long as less - luminous cluster galaxies are assumed to be less massive , their ism should be easily stripped by environmental effects , and then their sfa must be suppressed . in this section ,",
    "we inversely examine which environmental effect is inactive in stripping the ism in less - luminous cluster galaxies .",
    "the typical effects are the following : * ( i ) * tidal interaction between a cluster and its galaxies ; * ( ii ) * ram pressure owing to intracluster medium ( icm ) ; and * ( iii ) * kelvin - helmholtz instability ( khi ) via disturbances on the boundary of the ism and icm ( e.g. , henriksen & byrd 1996 ) . since we focus on less - luminous galaxies , we assume that luminosity of a galaxy is proportional to its dynamical mass , and adopt the density profile of burkert @xcite , which well explains that of less - massive galaxies . in that profile ,",
    "the radius of a galaxy ( @xmath34 ) is related to its dynamical mass ( @xmath35 ) by @xmath36 .",
    "we firstly consider the tidal effect between a cluster and its galaxy , comparing with the self - gravity of its galaxy . the tidal force ( @xmath37 ) and the gravitational force ( @xmath38 )",
    "are given as @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively .",
    "here @xmath41 is the gravitational constant , @xmath42 the mass of a galaxy cluster , and @xmath43 the radius of a galaxy cluster . from the equilibrium of the two forces",
    ", we obtain a critical mass : @xmath44 this means that the tidal force is not effective for less - luminous galaxies when their mass is smaller than @xmath45 , although it does not prove anything for massive galaxies which the burkert profile may not apply .",
    "secondly , we take the ram pressure ( @xmath46 ) due to the icm , and compare with the gravity @xmath47 of a galaxy in the same dimension of the pressure .",
    "these are expressed as @xmath48 , and @xmath49 , respectively . here",
    "@xmath50 is the mass density of icm , @xmath51 the velocity of a galaxy , @xmath52 the surface density of a galaxy , @xmath53 that of ism , and @xmath54 the ratio of gas mass to dynamical mass .",
    "therefore , less - massive ( i.e. less - luminous ) galaxies than a critical mass of : @xmath55 are affected by ram - pressure stripping effects .",
    "thirdly , we take up the khi that is ineffective in a condition of : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the wave number @xcite , and @xmath58 the mass density of ism .",
    "thus , we find more - massive galaxies than a critical mass of @xmath59 are difficult to be stripped by khi .",
    "since the time - scale of khi stripping is longer than that of ram - pressure stripping @xcite , there remains a chance for galaxies that suffer khi to contribute to the bo effect temporarily before the virialization of their cluster .    here",
    ", we propose an alternative scenario for the bo effect , supposing that the blueness of galaxies reflects large sfa . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : mass_tid ] ) , ( [ eq : mass_ram ] ) , and ( [ eq : mass_kh ] ) , we find , when the mass of a galaxy is within the range of @xmath60 such less - luminous galaxies are affected neither by tidal interaction , ram pressure , nor khi . for such galaxies it is possible to retain their ism and sfa without the ism being stripped , and hence contribute to bo galaxies .",
    "finally , we consider the evolution of clusters from the view of their galaxies . in un - virialized clusters , their galaxies are expected to move relatively slow , and thus @xmath61 becomes small , the range of eq .",
    "( [ eq : result ] ) gets wide , and the fraction of blue galaxies is high . on the contrary , in virialized clusters the opposite situation is expected .",
    "thus , the fraction of blue galaxies becomes larger in clusters at higher redshift , according to their degree of virialization .",
    "our scenario is consistent with the observational fact that the fraction of blue galaxies is larger in irregular ( i.e. un - virialized ) clusters whose @xmath51 ( velocity dispersion among member galaxies ) is smaller than those of regular clusters @xcite .",
    "the consistency of our scenario with numerical simulations will be shown in tajiri & yoshikawa ( in prep . ) .",
    "we have investigated environmental effects on the sfa of star - forming cluster galaxies within the magnitude range of @xmath62 at intermediate redshifts of @xmath63 .",
    "the sfa is estimated from ew([oii ] ) . in less - luminous ( @xmath64 ) galaxies , we firstly find that the mean sfa of cluster galaxies is smaller than that of field galaxies . secondly , we find that some of the cluster galaxies have as large ew([oii ] ) as that of the actively star - forming field galaxies .",
    "such actively star - forming less - luminous cluster galaxies have never been predicted before . to explain this new finding",
    ", we propose a possible alternative scenario for the origin of butcher - oemler ( bo ) galaxies .",
    "we propose that bo galaxies are stable against kelvin - helmholtz instability and are not affected by tidal effects of a galaxy cluster .",
    "thus their ism is not easily stripped and they keep on their sfa . in younger clusters , such bo galaxies are more likely .",
    "as clusters become virialized , however , member galaxies become more accelerated , @xmath65 increases , and fewer galaxies are stable against kelvin - helmholtz instability . hence the fractions of blue galaxies decrease , which produces the bo effect .",
