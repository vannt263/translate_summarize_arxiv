    "topological systems are characterized by edge excitations that are remarkably robust to perturbations .",
    "they arise due to a bulk - boundary correspondence , where geometric properties of the bulk band - structure control the nature of excitations at the edge when the system is placed in a confined geometry .",
    "thus perturbations that can not affect the bulk topological properties , can not perturb the edge states either . for an integer quantum hall system for example ,",
    "bulk bands have a non - zero chern number @xmath0 , which also equals the number of chiral edge modes  @xcite .",
    "the topological nature of the system is responsible for the highly precise quantization of the hall conductance at @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite    chern insulators are topological insulators ( tis ) which show quantum hall physics in the absence of a magnetic field , where time - reversal symmetry is broken by introducing complex hopping amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "this can be achieved by doping with magnetic impurities  @xcite .",
    "chern insulators can also be realized by the application of a circularly polarized laser  @xcite , where tis arising out of such time - periodic perturbations are referred to as floquet tis ( ftis )  @xcite .",
    "the field of ftis has grown in recent years because of several experimental realizations ranging from periodically shaken lattices of cold - atomic gases  @xcite , to graphene  @xcite , dirac fermions on the surface of 3d tis  @xcite under external irradiation , and photonic systems  @xcite .",
    "in fact ftis are extremely rich , showing a variety of topological phases as the amplitude , frequency , and polarization of the periodic drive is varied  @xcite .    .",
    "laser frequency @xmath2 is in units of the hopping strength @xmath3 with @xmath4 being the bandwidth of graphene .",

    "since energy is not conserved upto integer multiples of the driving frequency , the eigen - energies of the floquet hamiltonian are known as quasi - energies .",
    "much like spatially periodic systems , here too , the floquet description leads to an over - counting where quasi - energies separated by integer multiples of the laser frequency represent identical eigen - modes .",
    "thus in order to avoid this over - counting , one restricts the quasi - spectrum to one frequency of the periodic drive , the so called floquet brillouin zone ( fbz ) .",
    "analysis of the floquet quasi - energies and quasi - modes shows that not only can ftis be used to realize conventional chern insulators ,  @xcite they also have unique properties coming from the fact that the energy is not conserved by integer multiples of the periodic drive . as a result of this ,",
    "the chern number of the floquet bands simply inform us of the difference between the number of chiral edge modes above and below the floquet band .",
    "effective ( 2 + 1 ) d topological invariants need to be defined to account for the the periodicity in the additional temporal direction , and to uniquely determine the number of edge modes at a given quasi - energy  @xcite .",
    "in particular , for ftis it is possible to have anomalous edge states appearing at the boundaries of the fbz .",
    "ftis can therefore realize topological systems where even though the chern number of the band is zero , yet equal number of chiral edge modes appear above and below it .",
    "when the laser frequency is larger than the band - width , conventional chern insulators are realized for moderate laser amplitudes , where by conventional we mean that there are edge states only at the center of fbz , and the chern number equals the number of chiral edge modes .",
    "the anomalous edge states at the floquet zone boundaries typically appear for resonant lasers where the resonance creates effective band - inversions  @xcite , with the anomalous edge states appearing at these band - inversion points .",
    "edge states at the fbz boundaries oscillate in time at higher frequencies relative to those edge states at the center of the fbz  @xcite .",
    "this leads to a situation where not all the edge states contribute equally to dc transport when the samples are connected to leads  @xcite .",
    "with all these unusual properties , one has to have a clear picture of how all the different edge modes , the ones appearing at the center of the fbz , and the anomalous ones appearing in the boundaries of the fbz , affect measurable quantities . thus we need to explore how these edge modes are occupied , and the current densities carried by them .",
    "remarkably , despite the intense activity in the field , this study has not been done , and we plan to undertake it here for a closed system in the absence of external dissipation .",
    "we present results for a fti realized by irradiating half - filled graphene in a cylindrical geometry with zig - zag edges , by a circularly polarized laser .",
    "we assume the system is closed so that the occupation of all resulting floquet quasi - energy states is completely determined by the laser switch on protocol .",
    "we study the four different topological phases summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and labeled as @xmath6 . of these four phases , one of them corresponds to an off - resonant high frequency laser ( @xmath7 ) , and the remaining ( @xmath8 ) correspond to resonant low frequency lasers .",
    "moreover , of these four cases , two ( @xmath9 ) are conventional chern insulators in that edge states appear only at the center of the fbz , while for the other two phases ( @xmath10 ) , anomalous edge states appear at the boundaries of the fbz .    for the above phases we determine the occupation probability of the bulk and edge states following a laser quench .",
    "moreover from the edge state population , we give simple landauer based arguments to estimate the conductance of the edge modes . in doing",
    "so we arrive at estimates that are consistent with a kubo formalism computation of the dc hall conductance of a bulk system with no boundaries  @xcite .",
    "thus even though the conductance is not @xmath11 for resonant lasers due to nonequilibrium occupation of bands , we uncover a bulk - boundary correspondence that persists even in the nonequilibrium system , where the hall response for a spatially extended system without edges is of the same magnitude as the transport via edge states populated in a nonequilibrium way for precisely the same system but now with spatial boundaries .",
    "in addition to edge state occupation , we also study the average current density , a quantity that can be locally measured using magnetometers such as squids . we find that the nonequilibrium population following the laser quench breaks inversion symmetry and creates a net sheet of circulating current flowing on the cylinder .",
    "we show that since the individual eigenstates are chiral , such a current density profile results in a charge imbalance between the top and bottom edges of the cylinder .    in order to understand the symmetries of the current density following the laser",
    "quench , we explore the symmetries of the current density carried by individual floquet eigenstates , and in the process highlight how even though the instantaneous hamiltonian has no special symmetries other than particle - hole symmetry , the floquet hamiltonian , on averaging over one laser cycle , shows some additional emergent symmetries such as inversion symmetry .",
    "we discuss the role of these symmetries on the current and charge densities generated by the laser quench .",
    "we now briefly discuss the relation between our work and existing literature .",
    "our study is in a regime complementary to ref .   where a small sample in contact with leads was studied , and where the role of the anomalous edge modes is determined by how well they hybridize with lead states .",
    "in contrast our study is for larger systems and also closed systems such as those realized in ultra cold atomic gases  @xcite .",
    "our results are also relevant for pump - probe spectroscopy of solid - state systems  @xcite , where time - resolved and angle resolved photoemission ( arpes ) is a very effective way of probing edge - state occupation probabilities .",
    "note that how edge states are occupied after a quench between two different static hamiltonians with different topological invariants has been studied .",
    "@xcite in our work we study quench dynamics for a case where the final hamiltonian after the quench is not static but is periodic in time . by virtue of this time - periodicity",
    "the edge state structure is far richer than in conventional tis , leading to richer dynamics .",
    "studied dynamics in a similar system as ours , however they focused only on the high frequency off - resonant case where the edge state structure is more conventional . here in contrast",
    "we study both off - resonant and resonant laser frequencies , thus highlighting how the anomalous edge states are populated .",
    "in addition even for the off - resonant laser , our results are qualitatively different from ref .   as our geometry , filling factor , and laser switch - on protocol results in a completely different steady - state current density profile .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ model ] , we present the model and derive expressions for the occupation probabilities and current densities . in section  [ results ]",
    "we present our results , while we conclude in section  [ conclu ] , and give additional details in three appendices .",
    "we consider graphene at half - filling in a cylindrical geometry with zig - zag edges that support edge states .",
    "the graphene sheet is irradiated by a circularly polarized and spatially uniform laser of amplitude @xmath5 and frequency @xmath2 .",

    "a bulk kubo formula computation for the dc hall conductance in a spatially extended system for this case revealed  @xcite a result of @xmath119 , consistent with the low excitation density of bulk states generated by the quench even for this phase .",
    "we would arrive at the same conclusion if we were to alternately attribute the entire hall response as due to the chiral edge - state studied here , where the bulk excitations degrade the maximum possible value by a small amount .",
    "while it is simple to understand why a pair of counter - propagating edge states at zero effective temperature ( such as those encountered so far ) will give a linear response conductance of @xmath119 , we now briefly explain why a pair of counter - propagating edge states at infinite effective temperature will give zero contribution to dc transport .",
    "if we think of the dc transport as a linear response to a small chemical potential difference , a net current flows because the population of say the left mover is increased slightly over the right mover .",

    "as noted above , the current density of the exactly half - filled case is zero . the way this cancellation comes about for the chern insulators @xmath9 ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) with a single edge state corresponding to @xmath129 is that the current density of that edge state is opposite in sign to the current density of all the bulk states @xmath167 .",

    "we now discuss the quench current density i.e. , the current density carried by the wavefunction at long times after the quench .",
    "this is shown in the four panels in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] for the four phases .",
    "even though the current density of each exact eigenstate is anti - symmetric in position along the cylinder , the quench current density is symmetric in position .",
    "@xmath169 why this is so is explained in appendix  [ app3 ] .",
    "here we give another quick way to understand this .",
    "it is convenient to define the time - averaged local density in the diagonal ensemble , which using eq .",
    "is , @xmath170 as shown in appendix  [ app2 ] , the combination of being at half - filling , the particle - hole and inversion symmetry of the floquet hamiltonian , and the fact that the quench breaks inversion symmetry causing @xmath171 , results in a local deviation of the density from half - filling , which is anti - symmetric in position .",
    "in particular , defining , @xmath172 , we have the relation , @xmath173 semi - classically , the current density is a product of @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the velocity .",
    "since the perfect chirality of the exact floquet eigenstates implies @xmath175 is anti - symmetric in position , and @xmath176 is also anti - symmetric in position , this implies a net quench current density which is symmetric in position .",
    "if the quench had preserved inversion symmetry by providing an occupation probability with the symmetry @xmath177 , then we would have had @xmath178 , and consequently the time - averaged quench current density would have been zero at half - filling .    a simple way to see why all this comes about due to the breaking of inversion symmetry , note that at the time of the laser quench at @xmath57",
    ", the vector potential is completely pointing along the @xmath68 direction .",
    "thus inversion symmetry in @xmath68 is broken resulting in an unequal population of states at @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "this implies that for every @xmath181 , there is a net current flowing in the system due to periodic boundary conditions in @xmath68 .",
    "since individual eigenstates are exactly chiral along the @xmath182 direction , this current density has to also imply that some net charge be moved from one end of the cylinder to the other . a slower quench",
    "will reduce the magnitude of this effect .    to generate this quench current density , all we needed was to break inversion symmetry .",
    "if we had no particle - hole symmetry for example due to next - nearest - neighbor hopping , then we would have still generated a quench current density , but this current density would not have been exactly symmetric in position .    thus we find that the quench current density appears as a sheet of circulating current on the surface of the cylinder .",
    "such a current density profile will generate a local magnetization , and is therefore detectable using sensitive magnetometers such as squids  @xcite .",
    "this result may also be useful for using a fast quench as a tool to generate dissipationless current flow in a carbon nanotube .",
    "we now briefly discuss how our results depend on the the length of the cylinder .",
    "we have taken care to ensure that the length is sufficiently long so as to clearly identify the bulk and edge states . as the length is further increased from our chosen lengths ,",
    "the edge states are not modified , while the bulk spectrum fills out more as more states are being added .",
    "the physical observables we study are properly normalized to account for this effect , and therefore do not depend sensitively on the length of the cylinder .",
    "one of the properties that make ftis unique is a rich structure of edge states , with edge modes appearing both at the center of the fbz as well as the boundaries . for a low amplitude laser",
    ", one can identify the former with off - resonant , and the latter by resonant processes . in this paper",
    "we have highlighted how these qualitatively different edge modes behave , the current densities carried by them , and how they are occupied in a closed quantum system where the laser was switched on as a quench .    we find that for an off - resonant laser , despite the laser quench , the floquet level occupation is remarkably close to a half - filled zero temperature fermi function .",
    "this is consistent with a bulk kubo - formula computation for the hall conductance  @xcite which found it to be quite close to @xmath118 . for the resonant laser ,",
    "we find a selective depletion and occupation of the floquet modes , i.e. , a laser induced population inversion for selected regions in momentum space . as a consequence we find that in the same phase ( phase @xmath125 for example ) the edge states at the center of the fbz are occupied at a low effective temperature , while the edge states at the boundaries of the fbz , and arising due to resonant processes , are occupied with a high effective temperature .",
    "a slower quench will not qualitatively affect this result because the laser resonance condition does not depend on the amplitude of the laser , but only on its frequency  @xcite .    by simply looking at how the edge states are occupied , and what fraction of the bulk is excited",
    ", we can use the landauer formalism to make a simple estimate for the conductance of the edge states and hence the hall response .",
    "we find this estimate to be consistent with the hall response for a spatially uniform system where no edge modes exist and the entire hall response is purely due to bulk states and was computed using the kubo formalism  @xcite .",
    "this is a signature of the bulk - boundary correspondence in ftis where hall response can be captured by two complementary ways , one entirely involving bulk states in an infinite system , and the second involving effective 1d transport along chiral edge states .",
    "moreover this correspondence and in particular the edge state picture also explains why the hall response for some phases like @xmath125 , when accounting properly for the nonequilibrium occupation is only @xmath183 of its maximum possible value of @xmath1 .",
    "we also find that the expectation values of the time - averaged quench current density shows some special symmetries , for example it is exactly symmetric along the length of the cylinder .",
    "we have shown that these have to do with the underlying particle - hole and inversion symmetry of the floquet hamiltonian and of graphene , where for the former the inversion symmetry manifests itself only after time - averaging over one cycle of the laser .",
    "we also showed that the quench current density arises because the laser quench breaks inversion symmetry say in the @xmath12-direction , leading to an asymmetric occupation of @xmath179 and @xmath180 states .",
    "thus when periodic boundary conditions are imposed in the @xmath12-direction , this leads to a circulating current on the surface of the cylinder .",
    "this current density profile is markedly different from the naive expectation of having clockwise currents at the top , and anti - clockwise currents at the bottom of the cylinder , where the latter would be the profile only in an exact eigenstate of the system .",
    "since each eigenstate is chiral , we also showed that the quench current density profile leads to a removal of charge from one end of the cylinder to the other .",
    "this unusual current density profile can be detected using magnetometers such as squids .",

    "in this section , using the symmetry relations of the eigenstates obtained in previous appendices , we prove eqs .   and  . we also prove that the quench current density is symmetric i.e. , @xmath258 , where @xmath259 is defined in eq .  .",
    "first let us consider eq .  .",
    "to derive this equation , we will apply the inversion symmetry properties of the eigenstates i.e. , eq .  .",
    "by fourier expanding the two sides of this equation , one finds @xmath260 consider the current density carried by a floquet eigenstate @xmath64 ( eq .  ,  ) . under inversion in @xmath261 , its arguments @xmath13 and @xmath262 ,",
    "would be transformed to @xmath180 and @xmath263 .",
    "therefore we consider the following , @xmath264 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times 2{\\rm re}\\biggl[\\phi_{-k_x,\\alpha , n_y - 2n_y + 2}^n\\bigl(\\phi_{-k_x,\\alpha , n_y - 2n_y + 1}^{n+m}\\bigr)^ * \\biggr].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we insert eq .   above to obtain , @xmath265 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times 2{\\rm re}\\biggl[\\phi_{k_x,\\alpha,2n_y-1}^{n}\\bigl(\\phi_{k_x,\\alpha,2n_y}^{n+m}\\bigr)^ { * } \\biggr].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after using @xmath266 , one can relabel @xmath91 and @xmath267 , to obtain @xmath268 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times 2{\\rm re}\\biggl[\\phi_{k_x,\\alpha,2n_y}^{n}\\bigl(\\phi_{k_x,\\alpha,2n_y-1}^{n+m}\\bigr)^ { * } \\biggr].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] comparison of the above result and the definition of @xmath108 , we find @xmath269 which after summing over @xmath13 proves that the average current density carried by a floquet eigenstate is anti - symmetric in position @xmath270 .",
    "next , we prove eq .  .",
    "for this we need to fourier transform eq .",
    "@xmath271 combination of the above with eq .",
    "gives @xmath272 according to the definition of the current - density in a floquet eigenstate , we have @xmath273 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times 2{\\rm re}\\biggl[\\phi_{k_x , n_y - \\alpha + 1,2n_y}^n\\bigl(\\phi_{k_x , n_y - \\alpha + 1,2n_y-1}^{n+m}\\bigr)^ * \\biggr].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] insertion of eq .   in the above",
    "gives @xmath274 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times 2{\\rm re}\\biggl[\\bigl(\\phi_{-k_x,\\alpha,2n_y}^{-n}\\bigr)^*\\phi_{-k_x,\\alpha,2n_y-1}^{-n - m } \\biggr].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] applying @xmath266 and relabeling @xmath91 and @xmath267 gives @xmath275 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times2{\\rm re}\\biggl[\\bigl(\\phi_{-k_x,\\alpha,2n_y}^{n}\\bigr)^*\\phi_{-k_x,\\alpha,2n_y-1}^{n+m } \\biggr].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after absorbing the minus sign , we find @xmath276 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times2{\\rm re}\\biggl[\\bigl(\\phi_{-k_x,\\alpha,2n_y}^{n}\\bigr)^*\\phi_{-k_x,\\alpha,2n_y-1}^{n+m } \\biggr].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from above it is evident that @xmath277 after summing over @xmath13 , we prove that pairs of floquet eigenstates with quasi - energy @xmath278 carry the same average current density , @xmath279    next we prove that the quench current in eq .",
    "is symmetric in position . for this",
    "we start with the definition , @xmath280 and substitute eq .  , above . then using that the current in a fully occupied band vanishes ,",
    "we obtain , @xmath281 now we change variables @xmath282 to obtain , @xmath283 next we use the recently proved relations in eq .   and  [ symj2 ] to show that @xmath284 substituting the above in eq .   and relabeling the labels @xmath285",
    ", we prove that the quench current density is symmetric in position , @xmath286    now we show that if @xmath55 was symmetric in momentum space , @xmath287 , the quench current density would vanish . from using eq .  , and using the definition of the quench current density , we may write , @xmath288 but an occupation which is symmetric in @xmath13 will allow us to rewrite the above as , @xmath289 implying a quench current density which is anti - symmetric in position .",
    "since the quench current density can not be both symmetric and anti - symmetric in position , it implies that if @xmath177 , this would lead to a zero quench current density .",
    "thus the breaking of the inversion symmetry by the switch - on of the laser is required to generate a net quench current at half filling .",
