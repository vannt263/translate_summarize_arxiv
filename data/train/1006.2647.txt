    "the top quark is the heaviest particle yet discovered and might be the first place in which new physics effects could appear .",
    "the properties of the top quark could reveal information regarding flavor physics , the electroweak symmetry braking mechanism and physics beyond the standard model(sm ) . for this reason ,",
    "the search for signal top production is one of the major goal of the tevatron and large hadron collider ( lhc)@xcite . the top quark production at tevatron has been extensively studied .",
    "so far no hint for the beyond the sm has been detected in tevatron@xcite . with the increase in the number of the top quark events at the tevatron",
    ", the experimental uncertainties are expected to be further reduced .",
    "thus , the comparison between the observed top quark production properties and more precise theoretical calculations will be a new probe for possible existence of the new physics . at the lhc ,",
    "top quarks are produced primarily via two independent mechanisms : the dominant production mechanism is the qcd pair production processes @xmath5 , @xmath6 and second is single top production .",
    "single top quarks at the lhc are produced via sm in three kinematically different channels .",
    "the s - channel @xmath7 production , @xmath8 @xcite , the t - channel w - exchange mode , @xmath9 @xcite and the @xmath10 production @xcite . since the cross section of single top production is smaller than the cross section of @xmath11 production and the final state signals suffer from large background events , the observation of the single top events is even more challenging than @xmath11 .",
    "it is expected that sufficient integrated luminosity and improved method of analysis will eventually achieve detection of single top events at the lhc .",
    "the process @xmath8 , compare to the single top production via t - channel can be reliably predicted and theoretical uncertainty in the cross section is only about a few percent @xcite",
    ". the statistical uncertainty in the measurement of cross section for this process at the lhc will be about @xmath12 with an integrated luminosity of @xmath13@xcite . at the leading order ,",
    "the cross sections of production for all three processes are proportional to the cabibo - kabayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements .",
    "however , the lhc can precisely measure single top production cross sections , and the ckm matrix elements could be measured down to the less than one percent error at the atlas detector @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is worthwhile to investigate the effects of physics beyond sm on single top quark production .",
    "search for new physics via single top production has been already investigated in @xcite .    in this paper , we study the effects of extra dimension theories on the single top production via @xmath14 at the lhc . in extra dimension theories ,",
    "if the gauge fields of the sm propagate in the bulk of the extra dimension then they will have kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations that can couple to the sm fermions .",
    "the masses of kk excited gauge boson will be proportional to inverse radius of compactification .",
    "if the inverse of radius of compactification is in order of @xmath15 scale or less , phenomenological effects of these states in ongoing colliders will be remarkable @xcite .",
    "there are various experimental bounds on these masses which arise from precision electroweak tests , cosmological constrains and low energy observables @xcite .",
    "the lower bound on the masses of the first excited of gauge boson obtained from @xmath16 searches in @xmath17 collision at tevatron indicate that they must lie above @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "if the fundamental plank scale as a cutoff of the sm physics is at around few @xmath15 , we expect that there will be higher - dimensional operators suppressed by the cutoff scale . for operators which respect symmetries of sm ,",
    "the constraints come from the electroweak precision tests .",
    "for example , higgs mass is limited by constraints which come from the requirements of vacuum stability .",
    "it is shown @xcite that the effects of the higher dimensional operators on the higgs mass are significant . however , in theories with extra dimensions , phenomenological constraints from cp violations , @xmath19 and electroweak precision measurements give a bound on cutoff in order of @xmath20 @xcite . in all of these analyses , it is assumed that the only new physics beyond sm come from the kk excitations of sm fields .",
    "note that the gravity induced processes will affect on electroweak observables and change lower bound on masses of kk excitations of sm fields but will not significantly affect on single top production @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we ignore the gravity effects in our analysis .",
    "as it is mentioned above , precision electroweak fits can significantly affect on lower bound of scale of kk excitations fields ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "in the literature , it has been shown @xcite that these bounds are at the order of @xmath15 scale . in light of these studies",
    ", we assumed that lower bound on kk excitations of gauge fields is at the order of @xmath15 scale .    in this paper",
    ", we study the contribution of the first excitation kk mode of @xmath0 which denoted by @xmath22 , on the s - channel single top production at lhc .",
    "it should be noted that for the high mass region of the @xmath23 , its contribution to the t - channel and @xmath10-channel cross section are very small to be observed @xcite .",
    "the @xmath23 in t - channel process is space - like and in tw - channel is real but the involved @xmath0 boson in the s - channel is time - like .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we summarize the effect of excited kk @xmath0 state on the single top production . in section",
    "3 we first evaluate the effect of excited kk mode of @xmath0 on the s - channel single top production at lhc and compare it with results which arise from other alternative new physics models . in this section , we discuss the degeneracies between these models and survey the possibility of solving this degeneracies .",
    "our conclusions are given in section  4 .",
    "in this section , we briefly describe the model and study effects of kk excited @xmath0 on single top production at lhc .    in this paper , we consider a simple extension of the sm to 5 dimension(5d ) which was assumed as a part of more fundamental underlying theory @xcite .",
    "note that gauge theories in more than 4-dimensions are non - renormalizable and should be treated as low energy effective theories below some cutoff @xmath24@xcite . as sm fermions and higgs carry gauge quantum numbers , they can not propagate in extra dimensions unless the corresponding gauge fields also propagate in extra dimensions . on the other hand , sm fermions and higgs may still be localized in 4 dimensions even if gauge fields propagate in extra dimensions . in this paper",
    ", we suppose sm gauge fields propagate in extra dimensions while fermions and higgs live on 3-brane .",
    "another case which all sm fields live in the same extra dimensions are strongly constrained by electroweak precision data @xcite . as is mentioned earlier",
    ", we do not consider gravity induced processes in our analysis . because they have negligible contributions .    in this model",
    ", we consider one extra dimension compactified on a circle with radius r. the coordinate are denoted as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the coordinate in the direction of the extra dimension .",
    "the compactification means that the points @xmath29 and @xmath30 are identified .",
    "as it is mentioned , we suppose that sm gauge fields live in 5d and so we can expand gauge fields with a fourier decomposition along with the compact dimension , @xmath31 note that the fifth dimension @xmath29 is compactified on the orbifold @xmath32 with two 4d boundaries at @xmath33 and at @xmath34 . in the above formula",

    "sm gauge fields live in 5d bulk , while the sm fermions and higgs doublets , can either live in the bulk or be localized on the 4d boundaries . as a result ,",
    "the fermions and higgs doublet couple to the kk excited gauge bosons only if they are localized on the 4d boundaries . after integrating over the fifth dimension ,",
    "the effective four dimensional lagrangian for charged electroweak sector can be obtained , @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the weak angle @xmath42 is defined by @xmath43 , while the currents are @xmath44 note that for @xmath45 living in the bulk @xmath46 is 0 and for fermions which are living in 4d will be 1 .",

    "therefore , in our model @xmath22 decays only to sm particles . as a result , to calculate the cross section of @xmath51",

    "the statistical uncertainty in the measurement of the cross section for this process at the lhc will be about @xmath12 with an integrated luminosity of @xmath13@xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention , the measurement of the cross section of the s - channel single top at the lhc would not necessarily lead to a deviation of @xmath95 from one or evidence of new generation of quarks .",
    "we have shown that for center of mass energy of @xmath170 if the mass of the first @xmath22 is larger than @xmath171 , the total cross section of s - channel single top production will be reduced and deviation from sm cross section can be up to @xmath172 which indicates that effect of large extra dimension might be detectable in this process . for center of mass energy @xmath159 , this effect will be smaller and we need more integrated luminosity than center of mass energy of @xmath3 .    to calculate s - channel single top production , we considered three different parton distribution functions for quarks and showed that deviation from sm cross section could not arise from these effects .",
    "we then compared our results with effects of other beyond sm theories .",
    "it is shown@xcite that for lh model and topflavor model effects of new gauge boson on s - channel single top production will be constructive .",
    "thus degeneracy between these models and our model will be distinguishable .",
    "we then discussed the effects of qcd @xmath169 correction and @xmath126 simple group model on single top production and mentioned these effects will be very small and will not be detectable at lhc . for unparticle physics model , effects of vector and tensor unparticle will be small but scalar unparticle effect will be detectable at lhc .",
    "nevertheless this effect will be positive and so distinguishable from effect of kk excitation of @xmath0 gauge boson .",
    "we would like to thank f.  taghavi for helping in parton distribution functions issues .",
