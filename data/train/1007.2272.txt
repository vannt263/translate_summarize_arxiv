    "ls  i  + 61@xmath1303  is one of the few high - mass x - ray binaries that have been recently detected at tev ( albert et al .",
    "2006 ) and gev energies ( abdo et al .",
    "indeed , ls  i  + 61@xmath1303  shows periodic tev emission modulated by the orbital motion ( albert et al .",
    "2009 ) , with a tev peak out of phase with that observed at gev energies , variable x - ray emission and radio counterpart ( see below ) . in the last few years",
    ", there has been a burst of activity trying to understand the nature of this source , particularly whether it is a pulsar or a black hole system , and which are the mechanisms that lead to the multi - wavelength behavior ( e.g. , bednarek 2006 , dubus 2006 , gupta & bottcher 2006 , sierpowska - bartosik & torres 2009 ) . in part , these efforts were prompted by the results of a large vlbi campaign ( dhawan et al .",
    "2006 ) , which discovered rapid changes along the orbit in the orientation of what seems to be a cometary tail , consistent with being the result of a pulsar wind .",
    "in fact , if due to a jet , the changing morphology of the radio emission along the orbit would require a highly unstable jet , and the shape of this structure would not be expected to be reproduced orbit after orbit ( albert et al .",
    "2008 ; see however massi & bernad 2009 for an alternative explanation ) .",
    "the repeatability of the orbital modulation and _ simultaneous _ multiwavelength studies are thus crucial for constraining models .",
    "however , soft x - ray pointed observations of ls  i  + 61@xmath1303  have in general been too limited to cover full orbits of the system , which has a period of @xmath226.5 days , or to study long - term evolution of the x - ray orbital profile . as an example , the observations at soft x - rays conducted by _ xmm - newton _",

    "( bignami et al .",
    "1981 ) were all too short to cover even a single full orbit .",
    "longer term - observations of ls  i  + 61@xmath1303  were performed using instruments such as the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) all sky monitor ( asm ) ( see leahy 2001 ) and _ swift_-xrt ( esposito et al .",
    "2007 ) and , at harder x - rays , by _",
    "integral_-ibis / isgri ( chernyakova et al . 2006 , zhang et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the most aggressive monitoring campaign at soft x - rays was done so far with the proportional counter array ( pca ) on _ rxte_. intensive monitoring during the month of march 1996 were analyzed by harrison et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and grenier and rau ( 2001 ) .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 2009 ) recently analyzed about five months of _",
    "rxte_/pca observations covering the period 2007 august 28 to 2008 february 2 , reporting the discovery of several flares but only a marginal detection of orbital modulation .",
    "furthermore , their orbital profile hinted at a two - peak lightcurve in the 210 kev band ( see their figure 2 ) .",
    "hint of a similar two - peak feature was reported by paredes et al .",
    "( 1997 ) with 10 months of _ rxte_/asm data , covering 1996 february to december .",
    "although the two , as yet unconfirmed , x - ray peaks are not located at the expected phases according to earlier proposed two - peaked accretion models ( e.g. taylor et al .",
    "1992 , mart & paredes 1996 ) , such models do predict two local maxima in the radio and x - ray lightcurves .",
    "an alternative approach to the study of ls  i  + 61@xmath1303  has been to focus on possible correlated variability , particularly after the system has been detected at higher energies ( albert et al .",
    "2006 , abdo et al .",
    "the first _ strictly simultaneous _ observations at tev and x - rays of ls  i  + 61@xmath1303  have been recently presented by the magic collaboration ( albert et al .",
    "2009 ) . using observations by _ xmm - newton _ , _ swift _ , and magic during @xmath3 of an orbit , it was found that there is a correlation between the x - ray and tev emission at the time where the latter was measurable .",
    "other campaigns , e.g. , acciari et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , fall short of achieving such a result , probably because of non - simultaneity or being based on short snapshots of the system .",
    "but , given that the soft x - ray and the tev emission themselves can be highly variable individually , a simultaneous correlation may only be indicative of local physical conditions , and not taken as a proof of a persistent correlation between energy bands , orbit after orbit . indeed , at several recent conferences where results from the veritas array have been presented ( e.g. aliu et al . 2010 ) , it was noted that ls  i  + 61@xmath1303  could now be in an unusual tev low state .",
    "in this letter we report on several years of sensitive x - ray monitoring of ls  i  + 61@xmath1303  obtained by the _ rxte _ satellite ( see gruber et al .",
    "the observations covered 35 full cycles of the 26.496 day binary period and constitute the largest continuous pointed x - ray monitoring dataset on ls  i  + 61@xmath1303  to date .",
    "our dataset covers the period between 2006 october and 2010 march , and includes 326 _ rxte_/pca pointed observations identified by proposal numbers 92418 , 93017 , 93100 , 93101 , 93102 , 94102 , and 95102 .",
    "these observations provide a total of 483 ks of exposure time on the source . here",
    ", we focus on the data since 2007 september , which constitute the majority of the data ( 473 ks ) and have smaller time gaps between observations .    the analysis of pca data was performed using heasoft 6.6 .",
    "we filtered the data using the standard _ rxte_/pca criteria .",
    "to be precise , only pcu2 ( in the 04 numbering scheme ) has been used for the analysis , because it is the only pcu that was 100% on during the observations .",
    "we select time intervals where the source elevation is @xmath4 and the pointing offset is @xmath5 .",
    "the background file used in analysis of pca data is the most recent available from the heasarc website for faint sources , and detector breakdown events have been removed .    to search for a periodic signal in the lightcurve data",
    ", we used the lomb - scargle periodogram method .",
    "power spectra were generated for the light curve using the period subroutine ( press & rybicki 1989 ) , and checked using the powspec tool of the xronos software package .",
    "the oversampling and high - frequency factors which set the period resolution and range ( press & rybicki 1989 ) were set to search for periodic variability in the 1  1000 days range .",
    "the lomb - scargle technique allows us to sample below the average nyquist period ( with reduced sensitivity ) due to the unevenly sampled nature of the data , without creating problems due to aliasing .",
    "the 99% white noise significance levels were estimated using monte carlo simulations ( see e.g. kong , charles & kuulkers 1998 ) .",
    "the 99% red noise significance levels were estimated using the redfit subroutine , which can provide the red - noise spectrum via fitting a first - order auto - regressive process to the time series ( schulz & mudelsee 2002 ) .",
    "the upper panel of figure 1 represents the lightcurve ( in 64 seconds time bins in the 330 kev band ) of the whole extent of the observations analyzed .",
    "this data set significantly extends ( more than by a factor of 5 ) that considered by smith et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , which covers only the 20072008 campaign , from mjd 54340 to 54498 . from this lightcurve",
    "one can see that , on top of the overall behavior typical of the source , there are several short flares .",
    "a few of these short flares were also observed by smith et al .",
    "( based on the same data ) .",
    "we observe additional flares at about mjd 54670.84 ( first reported by ray et al .",
    "2008 ) and at mjd 54699.65 . a detailed study of these flares will be provided elsewhere .",
    "these short flares would significantly affect the study of the orbital profile of ls  i  + 61@xmath1303 , hence we decided to remove them from the current analysis . to cut them out , clipped all observations with count rates above 3 times the mean value of 1.551 @xmath6 0.008 counts s@xmath7 ( see horizontal line in top panel of figure 1 ) .",
    "we tested that our results were not sensitive to changing the cut to 5@xmath8 above the mean , or cutting based on fitting a gaussian standard deviation @xmath8 . with this flux cut , we folded the data modulo the radio period of 26.4960@xmath60.0028 days ( gregory 2002 ) with the orbital zero phase taken at jd 2443366.775 ( gregory & taylor 1978 ) .",
    "the result can be seen in the second panel of figure 1 .",
    "a clear orbital modulation can be seen in the x - ray data , with a peak rising up around phase 0.45 .",
    "this phase is shortly after the periastron passage , which is between phase 0.230.30 ( casares et al .",
    "2005 ; aragona et al .",
    "2009 ; grundstrom et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the third panel of figure 1 shows the power spectrum analysis of the unfolded lightcurve .",
    "a peak is found at 26.68@xmath60.58 days , matching the orbital period of the system and presenting a power density of @xmath2160 .",
    "this is the first time that such an x - ray orbital periodicity is clearly shown in pca data .",
    "the white noise and the red noise , both at 99% confidence level , are marked in the same figure , and present a much smaller power .",
    "a second peak is visible in the power spectrum , corresponding to the first harmonic , with periodicity at 13.36@xmath60.12 days .",
    "we investigated whether the orbital light curve is stable in time .",
    "to that aim , we divided our data into 5 periods of 6 months each , which provided good statistics at all the phases of the orbit .",
    "figure [ 6months ] shows the folded lightcurve in each of the 6-months periods , ordered by time .",
    "figure [ 2a ] ( left panel ) shows a superposition of the folded lightcurves obtained in each 6-months period .",
    "significant ( more than 7@xmath8 ) variations in the flux at a fixed phase value appear , with the largest differences being located in the phase range around the global peak seen in the middle panel of figure 1 . in figure [ 2a ] ( right panel ) we plot the modulated flux fraction ( obtained as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the maximum and minimum count rates found in each 6-months orbital profile after background subtraction ; see figure [ 6months ] ) as a function of time ( one point for each of the 6-months period considered ) .",
    "it is immediately obvious that , while the orbital average value of the count rate remains similar , the modulated signal significantly varies in time , increasing monotonically during the observations .     from the individual 6-month orbital profiles ( shown in figure [ 6months ] ) , and",
    "the example of month - by - month variability ( shown in figure [ 22 ] ) , one can conclude that the x - ray profile is not stable at any of these timescales .",
    "we find the phase of x - ray maximum anywhere from phase 0.3 to 0.9 in both the single orbit and 6-month averages .",
    "looking at the lightcurves , one sees changes both in flux level and shape , starting with the appearance of a weakly - modulated double - peaked structure and evolving into a more clearly visible , broad single - peaked lightcurve at later times .",
    "however , fitting one and two sine functions having the orbital and half the orbital periods , respectively , we find large @xmath12-values compared to the number of d.o.f .",
    "then , in both cases , the fits are not good enough to make claims , indicating that more harmonics are needed , which can not be well tested with the current data given the low d.o.f .",
    "in addition , the power spectrum remains featureless in most of these shorter 6-months periods due to limited statistics ( i.e. , periodicity hints remain below the red noise in most of the individual 6-months datasets ) . in one of the 6-month periods though ( the third one ) ,",
    "the x - ray periodicity is significantly seen in the power spectrum .",
    "we also noted signals appearing between 1 and @xmath2 2 days , which result from the spacing of the observations and are thus unrelated to the physical behavior of the source",
    ".     we also report on several flares ( see also smith et al .",
    "2009 ) observed in this long - term monitoring .",
    "however , caution should be exercised the pca field of view is about 1 degree ( fwhm ) so there is no direct evidence for the relation of this flaring phenomenology with ls  i  + 61@xmath1303 . since none of these short flares were observed by any instrument with a better spatial resolution , we can not exclude that they were generated in a nearby ( in sky projection ) source .    similarly , on 2008 september 10th , _",
    "swift_-bat triggered on a short sgr - like burst from the direction of ls  i  + 61@xmath1303  ( de pasquale et al .",
    "the bat location of the burst had an uncertainty of 2.2 arcminutes ( all at 90% confidence level ; barthelmy et al .",
    "2008 ) , centered 88 arcseconds away from the sub - arcsecond accurate position of ls  i  + 61@xmath1303 .",
    "the other telescope onboard , _",
    "swift_-xrt did not detect the burst because it started observing 921s after the bat trigger ( evans et al .",
    "the xrt did detect ls  i  + 61@xmath1303  ( being the brightest source in the field ) at a flux level and a spectrum consistent with what was previously observed by other missions and _ swift_-xrt itself ( leahy et al . 1997 , greiner & rau 2001 , sidoli et al .",
    "2006 , esposito et al .",
    "2007 ) . following these notices dubus & giebels ( 2008 ) noted that the burst location , lightcurve , duration , fluence , and spectra were fully consistent with a soft @xmath0-ray repeater / anomalous x - ray pulsar short duration burst originating from ls  i  + 61@xmath1303 .",
    "they then considered this to be the first manifestation of magnetar - like activity in a high - mass x - ray binary , concluding that ls  i  + 61@xmath1303  was likely to host a young , but highly magnetized pulsar .",
    "this is a tantalizing hypothesis for which , like the association of the pca flares with ls  i  + 61@xmath1303 , there is yet no proof .",
    "rea & torres ( 2008 ) and muoz - arjonilla et al .",
    "( 2008 ) analyzed archival _",
    "acis - i observation of ls  i  + 61@xmath1303  performed on 2006 april 7th ( 50ks ; paredes et al .",
    "2007 ) , showing that many faint sources are detected in the field of view .",
    "thus , any of the several x - ray sources without a radio counterpart within the field of view could be the origin of the magnetar - like burst .",
    "pca observation nearest to the burst is obsid 93102 - 01 - 32 - 01 , mjd 54719 at 18:17 ut , about 6 hours after the burst .",
    "the total exposure time is 1492 s. no flares are detected in this observation .",
    "the max count rate is 1.86 cts / s and the average count rate is 1.09 cts / s .",
    "this latter result is consistent with the report by ray et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , made immediately after the swift burst was announced .",
    "the discovery of high and very high energy gamma - ray emitting x - ray binaries triggered an intense effort to understand the particle acceleration , absorption , and emission mechanisms in these binary systems .",
    "the eccentricity and relatively small orbital periods provide significant changes of physical conditions along the orbit . despite this effort ,",
    "the nature of the compact object and emission mechanisms powering these systems is not settled .",
    "because of this , multi - frequency observations and long - term monitoring campaigns such as the one reported here are essential .",
    "multi - frequency observations can provide knowledge of the dominance of single or multiple particle populations , and of the nature of these particles .",
    "for instance , if the radiation mechanisms are dominated by a single particle population , an x - ray / vhe correlation with similar fluxes would favor leptonic models over hadronic ones , where the luminosity in x - rays should be less , given their origin in secondary particles . on the other hand , long - term monitoring provides information on possible trends in the overall behavior of the source , and gives perspective as of the steadiness or variability of the former conclusions .",
    "such monitoring can also catch unusual events or source states that could provide the key to the nature of the source .",
    "there are a few potential observations that would conclusively demonstrate the true nature , such as the discovery of pulsations at any frequency or the detection of clear accretion signals , both of which are for the moment still elusive ( see e.g. , rea et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "this letter shows that the soft x - ray emission from ls  i  + 61@xmath1303  presents a periodic behavior ( visible only for long integration times ) at the orbital period , whose shape varies at all timescales explored .",
    "profile variability is seen from orbit - to - orbit all the way up to multi - year timescales . the phase of the profile maximum also changes .",
    "it is then possible that the x - ray emission is orbitally modulated due to the interaction of a stellar wind flow with a pulsar wind ( e.g. , dubus et al .",
    "2006 , sierpowska - bartosik & torres 2008 ) or a jet ( e.g. , gupta & bttcher 2006 , bosch - ramon et al .",
    "2006 ) , but the details of such variability may strongly depend on the intrinsic behavior of the be stellar wind present in the system .",
    "our results imply the following :    1 .   the study of short - term , simultaneous multifrequency observations such as the one made by the magic collaboration ( albert et al .",
    "2009 ) produce local - in - time information useful for determining the process or the primaries responsible for the radiation detected , but do not establish a steady overall behavior .",
    "the fact that the x - ray and the tev emission from ls  i  + 61@xmath1303  are correlated in a single short observation can not be used to claim that the position in phase of the maxima in the lightcurves are maintained on timescales longer than the simultaneous observations themselves .",
    "in fact , given the variable nature of the x - ray emission a correlation found in a short observation might not be sufficient proof that this correlation maintains in time . 2 .   long - term variability in x - rays do occur on timescales of years .",
    "thus , if the tev and x - ray emission are indeed always correlated , the tev maximum should also vary in phase .",
    "in addition , the relative strengths of the emission in these bands can be affected by the level of absorption at which the maximal photon production happens ( e.g. , see sierpowska - bartosik & torres 2009 ) , varying from orbit to orbit .",
