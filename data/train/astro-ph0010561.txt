    "mapping the distribution of galaxies and their peculiar velocity field constitutes a major research area in modern astronomy setting both the observational and theoretical foundations of cosmology and , in particular , of large scale structure ( lss ) . within the framework of gravitational instability ,",
    "the large scale galaxy distribution offers a probe of the nature of the primordial perturbation field , and can be used to set strong constraints on the values of cosmological parameters .",
    "however , since astronomical observations give only incomplete and noisy information on the real universe , the recovery of the underlying signal from these observations can be a non - trivial task , forcing one to resort to regularization methods , , wiener filtering ( wiener 1949 ; rybicki & press 1992 ; zaroubi  1995 ) and the maximum entropy algorithm ( gull 1989 ) .",
    "in particular , the wf has been widely applied to galaxy surveys ( lahav  1994 ; fisher  1995 ; schmoldt  2000 ) , cmb studies ( bunn  1994 ; tegmark & efstathiou 1997 , bouchet & gispert , 1999 ) , and galaxy peculiar velocity catalogs ( hoffman  2000 ; zaroubi 2000 ; zaroubi  1999 & 2001a ) .",
    "the wf provides an optimal estimator of the underlying field in the sense of a minimum - variance solution given the data and an assumed  model ( wiener 1949 ; press  1992 ) .",
    "the  defines the data auto - correlation and the data - field cross - correlation matrices . in the case where the data is drawn from a random gaussian field ,",
    "the wf estimator coincides with the conditional mean field and with the most probable configuration given the data ( see zaroubi  1995 ) .",
    "although the application of the wf is very simple and has proven to be useful for many purposes , it is easy to show that the estimator is intrinsically biased , often in a scale dependent manner .",
    "the main cause of this bias stems from the modulation introduced by the signal/(signal + noise ) weighting it invokes .",
    "this drawback has prevented the use of the wiener reconstructed maps in many areas , power spectrum estimations , bias parameter extraction from galaxy peculiar velocity data comparison with galaxy surveys data , etc . to account for this bias in the power spectrum estimation a correction factor",
    "is often applied to the wiener reconstructed signal ( rybicki & press 1992 ; tegmark & efstathiou 1997 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new linear unbiased minimal variance ( umv ) estimator that is designed to avoid the intrinsic bias that exists in the wf .",
    "this is achieved by solving the minimization equation subject to the constraint of unbiased mean underlying field . to test the umv estimator",
    "we apply it : 1- to recover a 1d time series from convolved and noisy data with gaps .",
    "2- to mock secat peculiar velocity data set , a combination of the sfi ( giovanelli  1998 ) and the enear ( da costa  2000 ) galaxy peculiar velocity catalogs , where we reconstruct the distribution of the true density and velocity fields from which the mock catalog is constructed .",

    "[ sec : regularization ] two simple extra regularization methods are discussed .",

    "consider the case of a set of observations , or measurements , performed on an underlying field @xmath0 , or on any field linearly related to * s * , which yields a set of data points , @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , we are interested in measurements that can be modeled mathematically as a linear convolution or mapping of the underlying field ,    @xmath2    where @xmath3 and @xmath4 is an @xmath5 matrix which represents the response or point spread function ( hereafter rf ) and @xmath6 is the noise vector associated with the data . the rf will be treated as any function that linearly connects the underlying signal to the data , be it blurring or smoothing introduced by the measurement , some theoretical relationship between two fields , or any other linear transformation on the underlying signal .    in principle , reconstructing @xmath7 can be accomplished by inverting equation eq .",
    "[ eq : basic ]",
    ". however two main obstacles usually prevent one from pursuing this approach .",
    "first , the number of independent data points is usually much smaller than the number of underlying degrees of freedom .",
    "second , the presence of noise can render such a direct inversion unstable and the obtained results meaningless .",
    "due to these potential difficulties one is often forced to resort to some statistical regularization techniques (  wf ) in order to solve eq .",
    "[ eq : basic ] .",
    "similar to the requirements of the derivation of the wf we assume the  knowledge of the signal correlation function @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the complex conjugate of the transpose of the underlying signal , and angled brackets denote the signal ensemble average .",
    "notice , that there have been no assumptions made regarding the actual probability distribution function from which the field @xmath10 is drawn .",
    "we define the unbiased minimal variance estimator , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is an @xmath13 matrix that minimizes the variance of the residual @xmath14 , while satisfying the constraint , @xmath15 the ensemble average , @xmath16 , is an ensemble average over noise realizations and is very different from the ensemble average , @xmath17 , which denotes an ensemble average over signal realizations .",
    "this distinction between the two ensemble averages will be used only in this section , in the rest of the paper we use only the signal ensemble average .    in short",
    ", we are seeking @xmath12 that minimizes , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a _",
    "lagrange multiplier_. the ensemble average over noise realizations precedes the one over signal realization .",
    "the order of averaging over ensembles is very important since if it was reversed the contribution of the term @xmath20 will be null .    the constraint , introduced in eq .",
    "[ eq : constraint ] , assumes that the data is unbiased , namely the errors are random , and therefore requires that the estimator does not alter the value of the measured data points but rather it forces the field to retain the measured values at their appropriate locations .",
    "however , this requirement does not guarantee an unbiased variance of the reconstruction , on the contrary one expects that the variance of the reconstructed field is some compromise between the ( signal + noise ) variance of the data points and the assumed variance of the underlying signal .",

    "[ eq : minimize ] with respect to one obtains an equation that together with eq .",

    "the solution yields the umv estimator , @xmath22 the _ lagrange multiplier _ ,",
    "@xmath19 , is roughly proportional to the _ noise/(signal+noise ) _ making it dominant when the noise is dominant and small when the signal / noise @xmath23 1 .    in the absence of a response function that operates on the signal , namely , @xmath24 ( where * i * is the unity matrix )",
    ", the reconstructed signal at the location of the data points is identical to the data measured values which is consistent with the constraint given in eq .",
    "[ eq : constraint ] . in the rest of space the degrees of freedom",
    "are recovered by interpolating the data points in a manner consistent with the correlation assumed in the underlying theory .",
    "mathematically , the difference between the wf and the current estimator is that in the former the term @xmath25 is replaced by @xmath26 , a matrix that includes the noise correlations , an addition that accounts for the signal suppression which renders the wf mean field biased .    the variance of the field estimated in eq .",
    "[ eq : estimator ] is , @xmath27 where * n * is the noise correlation matrix .",
    "the variance of the residual , @xmath28    as a simple example , assume that @xmath24 and that the field is estimated in the exact locations of the data points , the variance in eq .",
    "[ eq : variance ] simply reduces to @xmath29 , recovering the power spectrum of the signal + noise at those points .",
    "the variance of the residual ( eq .  [ eq : resvar ] ) at the location of the data points is simply reduced to the correlation matrix of the noise , * n*. in addition , when the data points are uncorrelated with the rest of the underlying degrees of freedom then the reconstructed values , at locations different from those of the data points , are zero ( eq .",
    "[ eq : variance ] ) and the variance of the residual at those same locations , as obtained from eq .",
    "[ eq : resvar ] , is simply the underlying  correlation .",
    "substitution of @xmath30 in equation  [ eq : estimator ] yields , @xmath31 which one could be tempted to further simplify to obtain @xmath32 .",
    "normally however , the matrix @xmath33 is not square but rather has a larger number of rows than columns and its inverse is not unique and the inverse of its transpose , @xmath34 , does not exist at all .",
    "therefore , in most cases carrying the simplification further is mathematically incorrect .",
    "this simplification is possible if the inverse of both @xmath33 and @xmath34 exist , which is only true if the number of data points is identical to the number of degrees of freedom in the underlying signal or when the signal correlation function is a dirac - delta function .",
    "however , when the simplification could be performed the umv estimator is equivalent to direct inversion . since direct inversion in the presence of noise",
    "could produce very large uncertainties in the reconstructed signal one should resort to extra regularization that reduces the variance to a manageable size , an example of such an extra regularization is given in ",
    "[ sec : regularization ] .",
    "to summarize , the regularization strength of the umv estimator stems from the cross talk between the underlying signal and the data points at different locations .",
    "the stronger the correlation is , the more advantageous the use of the umv . with the absence of such a cross talk the number of degrees of freedom that one can reconstruct is identical to the number of data points , and the umv estimator is reduced in this case back to , @xmath35 , namely equivalent to direct inversion , a case that requires extra regularization in order to reduce the , often huge , uncertainty introduced by the noise .",
    "as shown in the previous section , the umv could be equivalent to direct inversion , therefore , while it produces an unbiased estimator of the underlying field , it gives a `` minimum variance '' that is too large to be useful .",
    "in contrast , the wf filter produces a manageable variance but a large degree of bias .",
    "hence , the umv alone is often insufficient to stabilize the deconvolution and consequently it must be either modified , supplemented with extra regularization , or replaced with another method .    of course , to fully solve the inversion problem one might want to use more sophisticated non - linear methods such as maximum entropy ( gull 1989 ) , pixons image restoration algorithm ( pia & puetter 1993 ) , etc . these methods , however more advanced , are much more computationally expensive and complicated to apply .    in this paper",
    "we choose to modify the umv inversion method with extra regularization that is both simple and easy to integrate in the algorithm . in subsections  [ sec : svd - regularization ] &  [ sec : wf - regularization ] , two simple extra regularization methods are introduced , the singular value decomposition ( svd ) algorithm (  press  1992 ) , and a wf - like regularization .",
    "these methods are basically applied to find the vector @xmath36 , defined as @xmath37 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : estimator ] ) .",
    "the difficulty in finding * a * could be due to the inversion instability of * o * or due to the noise in matrix * a*. in both methods suggested here this difficulty is solved by , in effect , adding elements to the diagonal of * o * or to its eigen - values so that it stabilizes the inversion of * o * and at the same time suppress the noise contribution of * d * to the vector * a*.      the following presentation follows the one in zaroubi  ( 1995 ) .",
    "mathematically the solution of eq .",
    "[ eq : estimator ] involves the solution of the equation @xmath38 for the unknown vector @xmath36 .",
    "matrix .",
    "the svd algorithm basically decomposes the positive definite matrix @xmath39@xmath40 is an auto - correlation matrix therefore it is a square positive definite matrix . ] into a multiplication of three matrices , @xmath41 , where the set @xmath42 is referred to as the collection of singular values , or the eigenmodes , and the columns of the matrix @xmath43 are orthogonal and proportional to the eigenvectors of @xmath39 .",
    "the inversion , after decomposition , is straightforward and gives @xmath44 . formally speaking , eq .",
    "[ eq : inverse ] has a unique solution if and only if @xmath39 is a non - singular matrix , namely if @xmath45 for all @xmath46 .",
    "however a meaningful solution can be obtained even in the case where @xmath39 is singular , by requiring the solution to minimize the norm of the residuals , @xmath47 .",
    "such a solution is obtained by substituting @xmath48 in the expression for the inverse for any @xmath49 ( press  1992 ) .",
    "the question arises in a particular problem of setting the lower limit of the singular values , below which the inverse values are set to zero . in general",
    ", the singular values measure the amount of ` information ' carried by each mode in the problem ( press  1992 ) , namely the small singular values do not have significant contribution to reconstruction , nevertheless , they can destabilize the inversion . as an extension of the ideal case of @xmath49 , we impose a cutoff on the small singular values in order to maintain stability .",
    "often , the structure of the sorted spectrum of singular values contain a very sharp drop normally appearing as a knee. the location of the knee usually determine the singular values that contain sufficient information . a simple cutoff at the location of the knee normally does the trick and stabilizes the inversion .    another possible criterion for",
    "the choice of the cutoff would be by expanding the matrix * o * in terms of signal - to - noise eigenmodes ( bond 1995 ) .",
    "this method allows a simultaneous diagonalization of the matrix * o * and the noise matrix * n * which in turn allows the usage of some signal - to - noise ratio threshold ( typically 1 ) in order to set the cutoff .",
    "for specific application see the 1d example in   [ sec:1d_example ] , especially the expansion shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : svd ] ( see also the the example discussed in zaroubi 1995 ) .",
    "the wf by itself is a very robust and efficient regularizer .",
    "the main reason for this stems from the relatively high values of the diagonal terms in the matrix @xmath26 .",
    "these high values usually come from the noise contribution , especially if it is uncorrelated (  white noise ) .",
    "this aspect is , of course , also responsible for the suppression of the wiener reconstructed signal .    from the point of view of the svd algorithm",
    "the stabilization effect caused by the noise diagonal elements is quite obvious , especially in the light of the following example .",
    "consider the simplest case of white gaussian noise where the noise correlation matrix is proportional to the unity matrix , @xmath50 . with the application of the svd algorithm",
    "the noise contribution is still proportional to the unit matrix and is the same for every singular value , this means that the singular values can be as small as the noise and non of them has a value of zero , therefore , the matrix is naturally stable an no extra stabilization is normally needed .    in order to utilize the stabilization aspect of the wf on the one hand , while avoid the signal suppression aspect on the other , we add a very small white noise - like contribution to the correlation matrix @xmath39 . naturally , one should seek the smallest possible addition in order to suppress the recovered signal as little as possible .",
    "the choice of the amplitude of the addional noise term could be guided by the same signal - to - noise cutoff criterion discussed in the previous section (   refsec : svd - regularization ) .",
    "this is , of course , problem dependent and should be carried out with caution .",
    "an example of the application of this approach is discussed in   [ sec:1d_example ] .",
    "hoffman & ribak ( 1991 ) showed that , within the framework of gaussian random fields and a given , any realization can be split into two parts : the mean field , or the wf field , which is determined by the constraints ( data ) and the residual field which is a gaussian random field .",
    "thus , one can make a constrained realization of the underlying field given the assumed _ prior _ model and the data .    with the umv reconstructed field",
    "one can produce constrained noisy realizations at every point in space only if the noise in the observed quantity is uncorrelated .",
    "the formulation here is quite similar to the constrained realizations procedure of hoffman & ribak ( 1991 ) ; one produces a random realization of the noisy underlying field and noise , @xmath51 , then sample it in the same way the actual data is obtained ,    @xmath52    here , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are random realizations of the underlying field and the statistical uncertainties , respectively .",
    "the noise in the random realization of the data @xmath55 is related to the noise in the random realization of the underlying noisy field @xmath56 through the response function , @xmath57    a constrained realization of the field given the data is given by :    @xmath58    here @xmath59 is the constrained noisy realization .",
    "note that if the noise , @xmath54 , is correlated one can not use this formalism as the umv takes into account only the correlation in the underlying signal .",
    "in such a case , one can think of a different approach , where the noise correlation is included in the estimator , in this case one can expand the umv estimator to have the form , @xmath60    this kind of noisy constrained realization could be very useful for cases when one has gaps in the data that one would like to fill , not only in a manner consistent with the data but also with the same power spectrum of the signal+noise .",
    "the umv estimator can be applied to many areas of lss and cmb for : 1 ) interpolating between data points ,  filling in gaps in the time - ordered data to help map - making , bridging the zone of avoidance and other uncovered areas in nearly full sky catalogs , etc . ; 2 ) stabilize inversions used to transform one dynamical field to another ,  from radial peculiar velocity field to density field ; or from redshift to real density .    here",
    "we present two examples , the first is a reconstruction from one dimensional time series of noisy convolved signal with gaps , cmb time - ordered data .",
    "the second example shows how this method could be applied to reconstruct the 3d density and peculiar velocity fields from observed galaxy radial peculiar velocity catalogs .      to test the performance of the umv estimator we proceed with a simple one dimensional example .",
    "let @xmath7 be a random gaussian time series , with a known correlation function , which we would like to measure in the time range @xmath61 $ ] ( the signal and time units are arbitrary ) .",
    "the measurement involves a convolution of the signal with gaussian window of 5 time units width , the convolution is describe by the matrix @xmath62 .",

    "such noisy constrained realizations could be very useful if one wishes to fill gaps in the data ,  from balloon - born cmb measurements , with a realization that has the same assumed properties of the signal+noise .",
    "an apparent difficulty arises from the fact that the current umv reconstruction assumes linear gravitational instability , yet it is applied to a universe that is _ non - linear _ on scales smaller than a few mpc s . to obtain non - linear reconstruction of the underlying field , @xmath98",
    ", one can include the non - linear correlation by substituting @xmath99 in eq .",
    "[ eq : estimator ] .",
    "this of course would only take into account the contribution of the variance and ignore the contribution of higher moments but in many cases this will do .    in one of the exampled presents here ,",
    "we have applied the method to galaxy radial peculiar velocity data and shown that the reconstruction is unbiased and trustworthy within a very large region of the volume covered by the data . in this context",
    "the umv reconstruction could be viewed as a compromise between the potent algorithm ( bertschinger & dekel 1989 ; dekel , bertschinger & faber 1990 ) , which assumes no regularization , and the wf , which relies too heavily on it .",
    "the umv reconstruction of the over - density and the 3d velocity field from galaxy peculiar velocity catalogs is suitable for bias parameter extraction from a comparison with the respective fields obtained from redshift galaxy catalogs like the pscz ( saunders  2000 ; branchini  2000 ) .",
    "the current estimator allows carrying out density - density and velocity - velocity comparisons using the same reconstruction technique ( zaroubi  2001b ) .",

    "<S> similar to the wiener filter ( wf ) , the umv estimator is derived by requiring the linear minimal variance solution given the data and an assumed  model specifying the underlying field covariance matrix . however , unlike the wf , the minimization is carried out with the added constraint of an unbiased reconstructed mean field . </S>",

    "<S> the general application of the umv estimator is to predict the values of the reconstructed field in un - sampled regions of space (  interpolation in the unobserved zone of avoidance ) , and to dynamically transform from one measured field to another ( inversion of radial peculiar velocities to over - densities ) . here , we provide two very simple applications of the method . </S>",
