    "in order to explore the physical mechanisms by which classical double radio sources are governed , observations of _ samples _ of such objects are needed to discern the salient relationships between different source properties , such as spectral index or luminosity .",
    "even observations of a complete sample will inevitably be convolved with the cosmology of the universe as well as with the consequences of the sample selection process .",
    "we first describe ( in  [ sec : selection ] ) how to avoid compounding the latter problem and giving rise to spurious , or hard to interpret , results .",
    "in  [ sec : samples ] we briefly describe the samples we have used in this new analysis , including the new 7c redshift survey , which allow us to avoid problems inherent in the sample selection processes . in ",

    "we develop our model of radio sources in  [ sec : model ] ; within this section , we summarise in  [ sec : consensus ] basic properties of radio sources which are widely believed to be correct and discuss what may be gleaned about the environments in which radio sources reside in  [ sec : env ] .",

    "is considered in ",
    "[ sec : pmod ] ; in this section we present a model for the rle played by the hotspot in governing the luminosity of radio source lobes . after considering in  [ sec : indiv ] the development of individual radio sources we describe in  [ sec : zmod ] how to correctly sample radio sources born at successive cosmic times in order to reproduce simulated versions of the data from our complete samples . in  [ sec : pararesults ] we present simulated versions of our complete samples using the modelling described in previous sections . in  [ sec : remarks ] we discuss what has been learned about the physical mechanisms by which radio sources are governed from our data and simulations , and briefly consider some implications for cosmological studies .",
    "we summarise the salient conclusions of our study in  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "we assume that @xmath0 and , except where specifically stated otherwise , that @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we use the convention for spectral index ( @xmath3 ) that @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the flux density at frequency @xmath6 .",
    "the simplest sample - type , referred to here and in companion papers as a ` complete sample ' has as its selection criteria only a single flux - limit ( determined ultimately by the finite sensitivity of the survey telescope ) in a chosen observing band and a chosen sky area .",
    "however , for any _ single _ flux - limited sample chosen in this way there will be an inevitable and tight correlation between luminosity and redshift .",
    "this arises . ]",
    "because for a fixed flux - limit , only powerful sources can be detected out to great distances .",
    "it is therefore impossible to determine for a single flux - limited sample whether the dependence of a given source property , such as linear size , is primarily on redshift or on luminosity .",
    "figure  [ fig : pzcartoon ] shows the coverage of the luminosity  redshift ( @xmath7@xmath8 ) plane by particular complete samples selected at different flux limits .",
    "( 50,200)(0,0 ) ( -58,-220 )    it is clear that just one such sample neither achieves a good range in luminosity out to high redshift nor a good range in redshift at low luminosity .",
    "the use of only one sample severely undermines any study pertaining to the evolution of radio sources .",
    "extensive coverage of the luminosity  redshift plane is essential if we are to decouple the luminosity / redshift dependence of a given source property and this is only achievable , given restricted telescope time , using a _ number _ of complete samples selected at increasingly fainter flux - limits .",
    "samples selected at high frequency (  1 ghz ) come with complications : at these frequencies the cores of radio sources can be a significant contribution to the total flux density .",
    "such cores are thought to be increasingly doppler boosted as the angle between the jet axis and the line - of - sight is decreased ( see e.g.  vermeulen & cohen 1994 ) .",
    "this means that objects at a small viewing angle are preferentially included in the sample , since their total flux measurement is promoted over the sample flux - limit because of their orientation , rather than their intrinsic power .",
    "in addition to having lower power in extended components , these objects will have shorter projected angular sizes .",
    "moreover , the ghz part of the spectrum of radio sources is reduced due to synchrotron losses as the source radiates , adiabatic expansion losses as the source grows and expands and , with increasing importance with increasing redshift , due to inverse compton losses from the equivalent magnetic field of the cosmic microwave background radiation .",
    "this is further compounded because of the increasing difference between emitted frequency and observed frequency as redshift increases .",
    "thus observing at a high frequency (  1 ghz ) will result in a vast loss in the number of high redshift sources which make it above the sample limit , since inverse compton losses increase dramatically with redshift [ the equivalent magnetic field due to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is given by @xmath9 nt ] .",
    "inverse compton losses have been invoked to explain the x - ray flux from the lobes of the nearby radio galaxy fornax a ( kaneda et al .  1995 ) and also as an explanation of the high x - ray luminosity of at least some distant powerful radio galaxies ( brunetti , setti and comastri 1997 ) .",
    "sources with large linear sizes at intermediate and high redshifts are most unlikely to be found in high frequency surveys since larger sources tend to have steeper spectral indices ( see  [ sec : alphad ] ) .",
    "[ thus high frequency surveys are a poor probe of evolution in the high redshift universe , except for the doppler boosted population . ]",
    "surveys carried out at lower frequencies ( a decade lower @xmath10 0.1 ghz ) detect emission largely from that part of the spectrum which is least subject to synchrotron / inverse compton losses and orientation biases .",
    "they thus inform on the intrinsic energy spectrum injected into the radio lobes in a way which is less affected by the _ history _ of that particular source .",
    "there is thus a strong argument for using complete samples detected at such frequencies .",
    "however , in making a radio survey at arbitrarily low frequency one encounters different problems : there are three mechanisms by which a survey conducted at @xmath11 mhz would fail to detect sources which surveys at higher frequency would detect .",
    "one of these mechanisms is synchrotron self - absorption ; this arises when the intensity of synchrotron radiation within a source becomes sufficiently high that re - absorption of the radiation by the synchrotron emitting particles is important .",
    "another mechanism is free  free absorption : absorption of the synchrotron radiation by thermal material intervening along the line - of - sight , possibly in the immediate vicinity of the synchrotron source  e.g.  by its own cluster environment ; an example of this mechanism in 3c295 is discussed by taylor & perley ( 1992 ) .",
    "the third mechanism arises because of a low - energy cut - off to the relativistic particles which give rise to the synchrotron emission .",
    "arguments that there is a departure from a power - law in the electron - energy distribution at low energies were advanced by leahy , muxlow & stephens ( 1989 ) who made observations of 3c radio sources at 151 mhz with merlin and at 1.5 ghz with the vla and found spectral flattening in the hotspots of three of the powerful sources at low frequency .",
    "an extreme example of sources which are rarely detected in low - frequency surveys are the giga hertz peaked spectrum ( gps ) population [ odea , baum & stanghellini ( 1991 ) ] .",
    "it is the turnover in the spectrum of these sources which gives rise to the absence of these sources in low - frequency surveys , and their presence in high - frequency surveys .",
    "the lower the frequency of the detection survey , the greater is the chance of losing small sources via one of these mechanisms .",
    "however , for a given turnover frequency , this chance decreases with increasing redshift .",
    "a sample selected at a fairly low frequency ( such as tens of mhz ) might miss small low redshift sources which would be detected at higher redshift because the observing frequency is likely to be less than the turnover frequency . in order to quantify the significance of this effect in samples selected at a frequency of 38 mhz",
    ", we considered that complete sample which is a subset of the 3c sample ( described in ",
    "[ sec : samples3c ] ) defined by declination , @xmath12 .",
    "we then considered which of the sources in this sample of 29 objects would _ not _ have been included in a survey selected in the same sky area at the lower frequency of 38 mhz , due to spectral turnover .",
    "the limiting flux density of the 8c survey carried out at 38 mhz [ @xcite ; catalogue revised by @xcite ] is 1 jy over most of the survey area .",
    "we set a threshold of 25 jy for our 38-mhz selected sample since this is the flux density which an object on the 3c flux - limit at 178 mhz would have at 38 mhz if it had a spectral index of 0.6  i.e.  a spectral index which can plausibly arise without any recourse to one of the spectral turnover mechanisms discussed above .",
    "three bona fide sources from a sample of 29 objects would be lost because of spectral turnover ; relevant properties of these objects are shown in table  [ tab : rees ] .",
    "thus the deficit of small objects ( none of which are at high redshift ) missing from a sample selected at 38 mhz rather than a somewhat higher frequency e.g.  178 mhz is at the @xmath11% level .",
    "we therefore note that stronger linear size evolution might in principle be found from surveys at 38 mhz because of the absence of small ( low redshift ) sources",
    ".    observing at a higher frequency will tend to detect a higher number of small low - redshift sources which have a spectral turnover , since a higher observing frequency is more likely to be above typical turnover frequencies . even with this , we suggest that a high frequency like 408 mhz might measure spuriously high linear size evolution , [ since a survey at 408 mhz selects objects at @xmath13 at rest - frame 1 ghz ] , since large and small low redshift sources will still make it into the sample but the only high redshift sources which make it into the sample are very short ones which are too young to have suffered catastrophic inverse compton losses to their lobes .    to investigate the effects of increasing the survey frequency on the selection process , we considered the differences between the 6c sample selected at 151 mhz ( described in  [ sec : samples6c ] ) and a sample selected over the same region of sky but at 408 mhz .",
    "we were able to do this using the sample of allington - smith ( 1982 ) which is roughly the same region of sky as the 6c sample but selected at 408 mhz to be brighter than 1 jy as measured in the bologna ( b2 ) survey .",
    "those sources which are only selected at 408 mhz in this way are listed in table  [ tab : as ] .",
    "we have redshift information for all but one ( b20927 + 35 ) of these objects hence we could overlay the points from this sample on our various plots of the four different source properties ( luminosity , spectral index , redshift and linear size ; an example is presented in figure  [ fig : da ] ) .",
    "we found that while selection of this sample at the higher frequency does result in the inclusion of more objects which tend to have fairly small projected linear sizes , these are over a range in redshift and we discern no redshift systematic bias implied by the properties of the sources included in the sample selected at 408 mhz rather than 151 mhz , at these flux - limits .",
    "@xcite pointed out that comparing samples with very different selection frequencies will find a spurious evolution in linear size , if a faint high frequency ( e.g.  @xmath14 ghz ) sample with the biases described in  [ sec : freq ] were to be compared with a bright low frequency ( e.g.  0.1 ghz ) sample without these biases .",
    "a study of the evolution of radio sources based on samples selected at different frequencies is not helpful because it amounts to a comparison between the same types of objects at different parts of their radio spectra",
    ".      it should be clear that samples which are incomplete or inhomogeneous should not be used for a study pertaining to evolutionary properties because of the subtle and unsubtle biases which will be present .",
    "even `` well - defined '' samples are not without their problems .",
    "for example , past studies [ e.g. , @xcite ] have used samples comprised only of steep spectrum quasars .",
    "the motivation for such an approach is understandable : the spectroscopy is relatively easy hence good coverage out to high redshift may be achieved . however , if we believe the unification by orientation model [ @xcite ; @xcite ] at some level ( and thus that for quasars the jet axis is at a small angle to the line of sight ) , then the projected angular sizes which we measure will be heavily foreshortened .",
    "one can not begin to deproject the sizes unless one has very large numbers of sources and a good idea what the mean and spread in the transition angle are .",
    "this problem is potentially compounded if quasars are used which are not from complete samples but have optical selection criteria as well , since this might preferentially bias towards boosted objects which are pointing towards us ( see willott et al .",
    "1998a ) .    in principle",
    "therefore , studies which have used only radio galaxies , which are presumed to lie closer to the plane of the sky and therefore will have a smaller difference between the projected size we measure and the deprojected size we would wish to measure , might be a more reliable indicator of the true dependences .",
    "in fact we chose to use all radio galaxies and quasars in our samples which fulfilled the criteria discussed in  [ sec : measure ] .",
    "such a selection criterion should ensure a random source orientation , allowing statistical deprojection of the linear size information .",
    "many previous studies of samples of radio sources have required the use of redshift estimators for a significant fraction of the sample ( e.g. dunlop & peacock 1990 ) .",
    "the most common estimator employs the @xmath15band ( 2.2 @xmath16 m ) magnitude .",
    "use of this estimator is motivated by the small spread in the near - infrared hubble diagram ( @xmath15@xmath8 relation ) for radio galaxies in the 3c sample ( lilly & longair 1984 ; best , longair and rttgering 1998 ) .",
    "it is now known that simple extrapolation of the 3c relation to higher redshifts and/or to fainter radio samples ( which contain fewer radio luminous sources at any given redshift ) leads to both large uncertainties in the estimated redshifts , and to systematic biases . at redshifts of @xmath17",
    "the @xmath18magnitude becomes contaminated by luminous emission lines , and other sources of non - stellar radiation [ eales & rawlings ( 1993 , 1996 ) ; simpson , rawlings & lacy ( 1998 ) ] .",
    "this is at least partially responsible for a scatter of 3 magnitudes in the @xmath15@xmath8 diagram at @xmath17 , and the little , if any , correlation between the variables ( eales et al .",
    "this large scatter may also be influenced by a genuine increase in the spread of stellar luminosities at early cosmic epochs .",
    "comparison of the @xmath15@xmath8 relations of 3c and 6c samples ( eales et al .",
    "1997 ) reveals a significant difference in the sense that 3c radio galaxies are about one magnitude brighter than the 6c galaxies at @xmath19 .",
    "further studies ( best et al .  1998 ; roche , eales & rawlings 1998 ) suggest that this effect is caused by a ( positive ) correlation between radio luminosity and the stellar luminosity of the host galaxy which is not yet well understood . to summarise , although it may now be possible to construct more reliable single - colour redshift estimators using @xmath15band imaging of the combined 3c/6c/7c dataset",
    ", the use of almost exclusively spectroscopic redshifts has been an essential ingredient of the work described in this paper . in the very few cases where we have been unable to secure spectroscopic redshifts (  [ sec : samples6c ] and  [ sec : samples7c ] ) , we have estimated redshifts by obtaining multi - colour ( optical and near - infrared ) information and fitting spectral energy distributions ( seds ) with template galaxy spectra ( e.g. dunlop & peacock 1993 ) .",
    "this method is likely to be robust whenever non - stellar contributions to the sed can be safely neglected .",
    "evidence that this is the case comes from the lack of any detectable emission lines in both optical and near - infrared spectroscopy of the relevant objects .",
    "[ [ sec : samples3c ] ] 3c ~~    the complete sample is that of the revised 3cr catalogue of laing , riley & longair ( 1983 ) , which contains 173 objects in an area of sky of 4.239 sr with @xmath20 and @xmath21 each with a flux density greater than 10.9 jy at 178 mhz .",
    "we excluded 3c231 ( m82 ) since its radio emission is due to star - formation ( condon et al.1990 ) rather than an active galactic nucleus .",
    "we also excluded another two objects , 3c345 and 3c454.3 , because their emission at 178 mhz only exceeds the flux - limit because of doppler boosting of their core emission .",

    "we use the 7c@xmath28i and 7c@xmath28ii parts of the 7c redshift survey , which were chosen by rossitter ( 1987 ) to overlap with the 5c6 and 5c7 fields of pearson & kus ( 1978 ) , respectively .",

    "only one source in the small sky area of the 7c sample ( 3c200 ) is common to the 3c sample , and this source is just included as a member of 3c for the purposes of the analysis presented in this paper .",
    "we excluded one object , 5c7.230 ( also known as 7cb082134.3 + 244829 ) , from the sample because its emission at 151 mhz only exceeds the flux - limit because of doppler boosting of its core emission ( blundell et al .",
    "neeser et al .  ( 1995 ) demonstrated the perils of trying to analyse the changes in maximum angular extent of the ` edge - darkened ' fri - class [ @xcite ] radio sources with increasing redshift and attributed the inclusion of such objects to the extremely strong linear size evolution with redshift which has been reported in the past ( e.g.  @xcite ) . to avoid spurious correlations and to focus our analysis on the evolution of one physically distinct class of object out to very high redshift , i.e. , to study the same physical phenomenon at different redshifts in order to compare like with like , we investigated the radio spectra and structure of the objects in our samples .",
    "one analysis which is part of this paper  the linear size evolution of classical double radio sources  amounts to considering how the separation of working surfaces at the ends of oppositely directed radio jets depends on luminosity and/or redshift . for this reason we excluded from our analysis radio sources of the fri structural type .",
    "we regard objects of this _ morphological _ type as the inevitable manifestation of low _ jet - power _ objects , where the jet - power is insufficient to form a supersonic shock , given its environment , where the jet impinges on the inter - galactic medium [ see e.g.  falle ( 1991 ) ] .",
    "the 6c sample and 7c sample selected to be a factor of 6 and a factor of nearly 25 respectively fainter than 3c , in fact contain relatively few objects of fri structure .",
    "this arises because in the relatively small sky areas of 6c and 7c few nearby bright but low - luminosity objects are found .",
    "note that luminosity is not a fundamental quantity in these objects in the way that the power transported by the jet is .",
    "distant low - luminosity objects which are found will not be the exact counterparts of low - redshift objects of the same luminosity : they must have higher jet power to compensate for the fact that for an object of redshift @xmath8 , inverse compton losses increase as @xmath31 .",
    "put another way , an object with a given jet power observed in an environment with a given density profile at high redshift will have a much lower luminosity at , say , 80% of the way through its life than a lower redshift object with otherwise the same parameters at the same point .",
    "[ note that this is _ not _ an observational error : the selection is made at a sufficiently low frequency and resolution that there is no question of missing sources because of undersampling smooth extended flux . ]    for this reason we do not base the criteria of which objects should be included in our analysis on their _ luminosity _ , but on their _",
    "structure_.    how then to identify whether a given source is type fri or frii ?",
    "we deemed that an object was a classical double ( frii ) if at least one hotspot was at the leading edge of a working surface . in practice",
    "this meant a bright , compact feature with a sharp discontinuity in surface brightness was at the leading edge of emission expanding outwards from the core or location of the optical identification .",
    "we did not require that this was the case on _ both _ sides of the core [ see e.g. , 5c6.62 also known as 7cb021029.7 + 325402 ( blundell et al .",
    "1998b ) ] to allow for the fact that although a working surface can exist , it can have a slightly weird appearance due to e.g. , doppler suppression , but the presence of one such hotspot is a good indicator that in the environment in which a given source is located , the jet - power is sufficiently high that a classical double radio source will be manifested .",
    "in some objects there was clear evidence of emission beyond a possible working surface , which had decreasing surface brightness with increasing distance from the core .",
    "we considered these to be a somewhat different physical phenomenon from the ` working surface + backflow towards the core ' type object , and called them fris and excluded them from our analyses . for those intermediate cases where we could not be totally sure that an object should be assigned to the frii category , we considered by examination of their integrated radio spectra ( see  [ sec : spectra ] ) whether there was any evidence of trailing outflow with increasing distance from the core , as might be evidenced by a greater flux from a survey measurement ( e.g. , from vla d - array or single dish measurements ) than from our higher resolution ( vla a- or b - array ) measurements .",
    "thus , objects which do not apparently contain any clearly defined working surface , but in which we _ believe _ all the flux is contained within a well - defined measureable extent , are classed as having defined angular sizes ( das ) .",
    "we believe that most , if not all , the angular sizes measured for these objects do correspond to the separation of working surfaces at the ends of oppositely directed radio jets , though we can not eliminate the possibility that some might be fris .",
    "our angular size measurements were our best attempt at summing the separations of the two working surfaces from the core ; in the absence of a radio core we took our best estimate of the separations of the working surfaces from one another .",
    "fitting of the radio spectra for the members of all three samples was made possible by consideration of data from many radio surveys , and in the case of the 7c sample in combination with data from our own vla maps as tabulated in @xcite .",
    "we fitted the flux density data using a bayesian polynomial regression analysis which assessed the posterior probability density function ( pdf ) for the required order of a polynomial fit ( e.g.  sivia 1996 ) ; we chose @xmath32 as the independent variable and expanded the dependent variable @xmath33 . in a number of cases",
    "the peak in the pdf led us to prefer a first - order polynomial , and the gradient of the fit ( @xmath34 ) was multiplied by @xmath35 to give the spectral index .",
    "in many cases the pdf led us to prefer a second - order fit , implying significant curvature in the radio spectrum : in these cases we calculated the curvature @xmath36 , and hence the spectral index at ( rest frame ) 151 mhz which equals @xmath37 in no case was a higher order fit preferred .    with a fitted functional form for the spectrum of each object , we interpolated ( in the case of 3c ) or extrapolated ( in the case of 6c and 7c ) to derive the flux densities at rest - frame 151 mhz and together with the redshifts we derived the luminosities in @xmath38 in a number of different assumed cosmologies , according to the formulae presented in carroll , press & turner ( 1992 ) .",
    "we derived all plots in the following three assumed cosmologies : ( 1 ) @xmath39 and @xmath2 , ( 2 ) @xmath1 and @xmath2 and ( 3 ) @xmath40 and @xmath41 ; similar dependences were seen in each case .",
    "we also considered separately just the class of certain friis and also the combined set of friis and das ( see  [ sec : structure ] ) .",
    "no significant difference was found .",
    "the plots we present here are for the combined set of friis and das and , except for figure  [ fig : dz3 ] , an assumed cosmology with @xmath1 and @xmath2 but the statistical analysis presents the numbers for all three cosmologies we considered ( see  [ sec : stats ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : pd ] shows the luminosities _ vs _ projected linear sizes ( the @xmath7@xmath42 plane ) of the radio sources .",
    "no striking dependence of the luminosity of an object on its linear size is seen , though there is a deficit of small , low - power objects in the lower - left quadrant of the @xmath7@xmath42 plane , and also of large , high - power objects in the upper - right quadrant of the @xmath7@xmath42 plane .",
    "it can be seen that the region most densely occupied by the solid circles ( corresponding to objects with @xmath8  2 ) is displaced to the left [ smaller projected linear sizes ] of the region occupied by the main density of plus signs ( corresponding to objects with @xmath43 ) , indicating a distinct anti - correlation of linear - size with redshift .",
    "( 50,170)(0,0 ) ( -56,-230 )    figure  [ fig : dz3 ] shows more directly that sources at higher redshift tend to have shorter projected linear sizes .",
    "this trend is seen throughout the redshift range , and is seen in each of our three considered cosmologies .",
    "the symbol type in this figure delimits the luminosity bin an object is in . in the middle plot",
    "where the assumed cosmology is @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the most powerful sources are not as powerful as in the cosmologies with low @xmath44 .",
    "this plot demonstrates that in breaking the degeneracy between luminosity and redshift , above a redshift of 2 the tendency for the sources to be smaller seems to be independent of the fact that the majority of these sources are not in the highest power bin .",

    "( for the calculated magnetic field strengths the synchrotron self - absorption turnover frequencies for emitting volumes with sizes of a few kpc are in the region of tens of mhz . )",
    "they interpreted this as the manifestation of a low - energy cutoff in the distribution of the radiating particles giving a deficit of hotspot emission at 151 mhz . in the context of an electron - proton jet where particle acceleration occurs at the hotspot such a cutoff is likely to occur when the lorentz factor is of the order of the ratio of the proton mass to the electron mass , since for a particle to be efficiently accelerated , its gyro - radius must be large compared with the shock thickness ( which is of the order of the gyro - radius of the thermal material , i.e.  the protons , present ) .",
    "although the precise nature of the low - energy cutoff depends on details such as the incoming jet velocity , it is likely that the value of the minimum lorentz factor does not change greatly from hotspot to hotspot .",
    "however , the cutoff in frequency at which this is manifested _ does _ vary from hotspot to hotspot since for a given minimum lorentz factor the minimum emitted frequency is proportional to the magnetic field in the hotspot ( equation  [ eq : lorentz ] ) . for those sources whose hotspots have higher magnetic fields ( which we will argue via equation  [ eq : qb ] are those with higher jet - powers ) , the minimum frequency at which significant radiation will be observed will be higher than for sources with lower hotspot magnetic fields ( and lower jet - powers ) .",
    "such reasoning is consistent with the low contribution ( 0.04% ) the hotspots make to the total 327-mhz luminosity in the archetypically high-@xmath85 object , cygnus a ( carilli et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "we now consider whether , for simulating low radio frequency surveys of the type described earlier in this paper , it is acceptable to neglect energy losses due to inverse compton scattering off the agn s own radiation field .",

    "thus , because of the specificity of the spatial extent of the equivalent magnetic field arising from the quasar radiation field , those regions which suffer the most from this loss mechanism are those which barely make a significant contribution to the overall low - frequency flux . the importance of this effect can not be so simply analysed for sources which are smaller in extent than e.g.  10 kpc .",
    "however , such sources are known to expand very quickly [ owsianik & conway ( 1998 ) ] and the radiating plasma in them is continually replenished by freshly injected synchrotron emitting particles .",

    "for example , the interpretation of x - ray detections associated with distant powerful radio sources as emission from hot cluster gas by crawford & fabian ( 1996 ) is at odds with the interpretation of brunetti et al.(1997 ) that inverse compton scattering from either the agn radiation field or from the cosmic microwave background is responsible for these x - rays .",
    "while the finding of garrington & conway ( 1991 )  that more distant sources show higher depolarisation  might appear to suggest that environments of more distant sources are more dense , it should be borne in mind that the more distant sources in their study , being shorter than lower-@xmath8 sources , inform on the depolarisation of lobe emission at spatial points much closer in the agn , where inhomogenities due to the host galaxy and the possible recent merger products which led to the formation of the agn will increase the measured depolarisation .",
    "in fact the interpretation of this very measurement is exacerbated by the `` youth  redshift '' degeneracy , a point to which we return in  [ sec : youthz ] .    in the absence of any clear consensus on this question we have preferred to adopt the simple assumption of no systematic change of radio - source environment with redshift and to see whether , when implemented in our model for radio sources , this necessarily presents contradictions with observed properties of radio - source samples .",

    "this gives : @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the total length of a source , i.e.  the hotspot to hotspot separation ; see also kaiser & alexander ( 1997 ) .",
    "assumptions about the radio source environment are therefore necessary ( as summarised in ",

    "comparison of the observational and simulated data presented later in this paper ( figures  [ fig : real3c ] & [ fig : mock3c ] for the 3c data and figures  [ fig : real7c ] & [ fig : mock7c ] for the 7c data ) will be used to show that @xmath105 must be similar to this value ( see also willott et al .",
    "falle s ( 1991 ) analysis also shows that the bow - shock must expand in a homologous ( self - similar ) manner .",
    "we wish to re - emphasize the distinction between the hotspot and the head region of the expanding radio source ( see  [ sec : headhs ] and figure  [ fig : toy ] ) .",
    "the hotspot , also sometimes referred to as the ` working surface ' , may well move around the head of the lobe as in the `` dentist s drill '' model of scheuer ( 1982 ) so that it is very dangerous to use the ( instantaneous ) properties of the compact hotspot to determine how the ( much larger ) head region of the source expands , e.g.  by equating the pressure of the hotspot to the ` ram pressure ' of the external medium [ e.g.  readhead et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ] .",
    "it is better to consider the expansion of the whole head region , and its associated bow shock .",
    "similar points have been made by begelman & cioffi ( 1989 ) .    from the jump conditions at a strong shock , ( see e.g.  landau & lifshitz 1959 ) the pressure across the head ( @xmath107 ) is related to the pressure in the external medium ( @xmath108 ) ( whose adiabatic index is @xmath109 ) in terms of the mach number of the bow shock ( @xmath110 ) by :    @xmath111    in terms of the dimensional argument of falle ( 1991 ) this may be expressed as : @xmath112 where @xmath42 is given by equation  [ eq : falle ] and @xmath113 is the density of the external medium ( identified with @xmath114 and given by equation  [ eq : rho ] ) .",
    "this , together with equation  [ eq : falle ] , gives an expression for the pressure in the head at time @xmath100 : @xmath115    note that this is identical to equation 12 of kaiser & alexander ( 1997 ) , but that we are making a clear association between environmental ram pressure and the average value of internal pressure across the entire head of the source , and not just the compact hotspot .",
    "it is significant in this regard that high resolution radio imaging ( leahy et al .",
    "1997 , hardcastle et al .",
    "1997 and black et al .",
    "1992 ) suggests that , ignoring the possibly ephemeral hotspot emission , there is very little pressure variation across the head region of a given frii radio source .",
    "it is also significant that the identification of the characteristic pressure with the whole head of a source , rather than the hotspot , avoids the ` lobe drag ' problem posed , for example , by williams ( 1991 ) .",
    "we believe that the material backflowing from the hotspot , via the head , inflates a cocoon which we identify with the observed radio lobe [ an idea which dates back to longair , ryle and scheuer ( 1973 ) ] and which we assume confines the jet .",
    "leahy & perley ( 1991 ) made images at 1.4 ghz of 23 extragalactic radio sources with the vla . in these images",
    "they detected the outer perimeter of the radio emission in most sources ; at these outer edges the emissivity does not fade slowly into the noise , rather it suggests lobes which are over - pressured with respect to their local environment and will therefore expand outwards as the source ages , and indeed as it expands longitudinally .",
    "simulations show that jets with a low density ratio and high mach numbers must produce backflow ( norman et al .  1982 ) .",
    "observational evidence for backflow , and high backflow speeds , comes from the spectral ageing analysis of liu , pooley & riley ( 1992 ) which found lobe - speeds ( i.e.  the anti - vector sum of the oppositely directed head advance speed and the backflow speed ) in some sources to exceed @xmath116 .",
    "when this is taken together with scheuer s ( 1995 ) analysis of arm - length asymmetries arising from light - travel time effects which limit the head advance speed to substantially below this , perhaps as low as @xmath117 ( see discussion of his method in  [ sec : vmod ] ) , the lobe - speeds which liu et al .",
    "derive strongly point towards high backflow speeds out of the hotspot .",
    "this , in turn , is strong evidence for a pressure gradient from the head of the source back towards the central nucleus .",
    "if one considers a slice in low - frequency surface brightness through a radio lobe , along the jet axis , a gradual fall - off in surface brightness is seen from the head of the source back towards the core [ see e.g.  the slices shown in leahy et al .",
    "( 1989 ) ] . over a given volume",
    ", pressure is related to surface - brightness under equipartition conditions by a simple power - law scaling : @xmath118 .",
    "thus we may infer a gradual decline in pressure from the head towards the core and that the head pressure governs the lobe pressure .",
    "the ratio of the pressure in the head to that in the lobe is not a well - defined quantity , but in the interests of simplicity in the modelling which we now describe , we will take for sources of all jet - powers a constant ratio of six for these pressures .",
    "a lower limit to the speed at which heads advance away from their agn , and hence the rate at which radio sources grow , comes from the fact that frii radio sources end in shocks which mean that the advance speed must exceed the ambient sound speed .",
    "the sound speed in an ionized gas at temperature @xmath119 k is given by @xmath120 where @xmath50 is the speed of light ; for @xmath121k this gives an advance speed of @xmath122 .",
    "upper limits to the advance speed come from consideration of the asymmetries in arm - lengths of radio sources .",
    "this kind of analysis was first done by @xcite ; a subsequent and similar study was done by @xcite .",
    "these studies assumed that all arm - length asymmetries arose from geometrical projection and light - travel time effects .",
    "no account was taken of effects arising from environmental asymmetries .",
    "the former study obtained an upper limit to the head advance speed of 0.2@xmath50 while the latter study , which also took into account the effects of possible misalignment in the directions of ejection of the jets , obtained an upper limit of @xmath123 .",
    "these values should very much be regarded as upper limits ; tighter constraints were obtained by @xcite who considered a sample of quasars each of which exhibited a considerable asymmetry in the presence of jets . the side of the brighter jet he ascribed as the nearer to us , attributing the jet brightness asymmetry to doppler boosting .",
    "arm - length asymmetries in these objects could then be more confidently attributed to light - travel time effects since there was a certain marker as to which was the nearer side to earth .",
    "scheuer s upper limit was somewhat sample dependent hinting at a non - constant hotspot advance speed , but gave a value of 0.03@xmath50 for two samples and for all of his samples taken together a certain upper limit of 0.15@xmath50 .",
    "this method of considering asymmetries , gives an ` instantaneous ' measure .",
    "in such a small source ( its linear size is 101.5 @xmath124 pc ) it is likely that the expansion is strongly determined by the local density profile within the core radius of its host galaxy and so the environmental assumptions of  [ sec : env ] would be correspondingly poor .",
    "] of the speed at which the heads were advancing out from the active nucleus at the time when the light we observe was emitted from the radio source .",
    "the term ` instantaneous ' is used somewhat liberally here , to mean ` within the light - travel time from the further hotspot to the nearer ' as distinct from the speed which would be derived by averaging over the life - time of the source by dividing the ( projected ) length of the radio source by its total age .",
    "speed limits in the same ball - park as scheuer s smaller limits were obtained by @xcite who investigated the empirical relationships between the external density and the size , pressure , advance speed and flux densities of compact symmetric objects by assuming the sources to be ram pressure confined .",
    "they argued that hotspot pressures adjusted to the ambient density so that head advance speeds could be constant and close to 0.02@xmath50 ( but see comments in  [ sec : falle ] ) .",
    "de young ( 1997 ) has pointed out that the energy density at the end of the jet used to determine advance speeds could be the result of cumulative effects of the jet - environment interaction over the jet length .",
    "he suggests a preliminary approximation for how the advance speed depends on lossy jet propagation , namely by considering a constant entrainment rate per unit length of jet .",
    "he derives from this a roughly constant jet propagation rate .",
    "we chose to adopt the formalism for the linear size growth developed by falle ( 1991 ) on dimensional arguments discussed in  [ sec : falle ] .",
    "the jet - axes of the sources we simulate in our models are deemed to be randomly oriented with respect to our line - of - sight . each source",
    "is allocated an angle to the line of sight which is drawn from a distribution uniform in ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "the projected linear size of each simulated object is derived by evaluating @xmath42 , the absolute physical size of the radio source , given in equation  [ eq : falle ] at the time when the source intercepts our light - cone , and multiplying this length by @xmath126 .",
    "in our model we deem that all radio sources will have their beams switched on for some maximum length of time ( @xmath127 , which has been taken as @xmath128 years ) .",
    "the time at which we ` make the observation ' ( i.e. , examine whether the source is above the flux - limit of our simulated survey ) of a given source is randomly chosen from a distribution described in  [ sec : zmod ] , between 0 years and @xmath129 years . if @xmath127 were chosen to be too short , there would be two erroneous consequences : _ ( i ) _ if the true value of the coefficient of proportionality for the head advance ( @xmath105 ) is known then sources will never achieve projected linear sizes as large as those which are observed and _ ( ii ) _ a distribution of points would be generated on the @xmath7@xmath42 plane , with an abrupt maximum size across the whole range in power , strikingly different from that which is observed . this would arise because the sampling of the radio sources would occur at early stages in their lives when very few sources would have fallen below the sample flux - limit . if the sampling of the radio sources broadly occurs over a time when the ` natural selection ' process ( the catastrophic decrease in luminosity due to synchrotron , adiabatic expansion and inverse compton losses ) governs the distribution of points on the @xmath7@xmath42 plane , then it much more closely resembles that arising from real data .",
    "if @xmath127 is chosen to be too large , then provided the simulations are allowed to run through the birth of a sufficiently large number of radio sources there will be no consequence on the distribution of points on the @xmath7@xmath42 plane .",
    "this is the case because the sampling of radio sources during the period of their lives when they are sufficiently bright to be detected by a survey on earth is still random throughout all of this period . that there may be a relatively long period of time when radio sources have fallen below a sample flux - limit during which our light - cone randomly samples them only has consequences for the number of sources which have to be ` observed ' until the simulated survey is complete .",
    "we took as our basic model for the luminosity - with - time profile of a given radio source the model developed by @xcite and @xcite ; this is the first model of extragalactic radio sources which directly incorporates the effects of inverse compton losses on the luminosity of a source .",

    "the stagnation pressure @xmath131 in the post - jet shock material will then be approximately given by : @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the area perpendicular to the jet over which the jet thrust acts .",
    "we equate this stagnation pressure with @xmath134 , the pressure in the hotspot itself .",
    "if we assume that the energetics of the hotspot are described by equipartition , then the total energy density in the hotspot is due to two equal contributions , one from the particles and one from the magnetic field ( this latter being equal to @xmath135 ) .",
    "we may then express the magnetic field ( assuming it to be tangled ) in the hotspot ( @xmath136 ) in terms of the jet power as follows : @xmath137 since for a relativistic fluid , and also for a tangled magnetic field , pressure is one - third of the total energy density .",
    "the break frequency in the hotspot @xmath138 , is inferred from the usual expression for the break frequency in a synchrotron source : @xmath139 where following leahy ( 1991 ) , the coefficient of proportionality @xmath140 is @xmath141 thus the hotspot magnetic field @xmath136 and equivalent magnetic field due to the cosmic microwave background @xmath142 are measured in nt , @xmath143 the ` synchrotron age ' of the distribution is measured in myr and the break frequency of the hotspot @xmath138 is measured in ghz . in the context of our model , we assume that the synchrotron age of the radiating particles depends on how long the particles are exposed to the magnetic field of the hotspot before they escape into the lobe .",
    "some effect of this type seems inescapable in any model for a hotspot [ e.g.  heavens & meisenheimer 1987 and eales , alexander & duncan 1989 ] .",
    "the magnetic field has the dependence on @xmath85 given by equation  [ eq : qb ] giving a value for the break frequency which depends just on @xmath85 , if we make the assumption that hotspot sizes are constant ( we assume for all our sources that the radius and depth of each hotspot are 2.5 kpc and 1 kpc respectively ) .",

    "we also assume that adiabatic expansion losses out of the hotspot are governed by the hotspot pressure as derived in equation  [ eq : pq ] , not by the pressure in the head of the source which governs the increase in arm - length of the source .",
    "note that this process of adiabatic expansion of the particles out of the hotspot into the lobes does not move the energy distribution of the lobes out of equipartition , if the adiabatic indices of the particles and of the fields are both 4/3 ( as is the case for a highly relativistic fluid and for the virtual photons of a magnetic field ) .",
    "a continuum of spectra may be regarded as injected to the lobe as the supply of particles in the hotspot is tapped for those populations of particles which have spent different dwell - times in the hotspot and thus have different break frequencies . since the magnetic field in the hotspot",

    "the @xmath7@xmath3 correlation may arise in the way we have suggested with the injection spectrum of particles , and the steepness of this distribution , governed in a way which depends on the jet - power .",
    "it is possible however , that the acceleration index of immediate post - shock particles is not necessarily 0.5 as implied by first - order fermi mechanisms , but that this spectrum itself is governed by the jet - power in some way depending on the detailed physical mechanisms of the hotspot .",
    "whatever the details of the underlying mechanism , an injection spectrum dependent on the jet - power is required to give the observed dependence of spectral index at rest - frame 151 mhz on luminosity ; if the dominant effective break frequency were comparable with rest - frame 151 mhz then the drastic depletion of the power reservoir of the source would have caused it to drop below the flux - limit of a typical flux - limited survey .",
    "possible evidence that the @xmath7@xmath3 correlation arises in the way modelled in this paper , namely through the steepening of the energy distribution of particles which are ultimately injected into the lobes by radiative losses in the enhanced magnetic fields of the hotspots of sources with more powerful jets , comes from the non - detection of optical synchrotron emission associated with the hotspots of very powerful radio sources .",
    "the number of hotspots which emit optical synchrotron radiation is small , for example there is a deficit of optical hotspots in very powerful radio sources such as cygnus a ( rser , meisenheimer & yates 1996 ) , whereas optical hotspots are detected in low - power radio sources ( meisenheimer et al .",
    "if it is the case , as we have modelled in this paper , that more powerful sources have higher magnetic fields in their hotspots than do less powerful sources , then the absence of optical synchrotron emission from the hotspots of the former arises simply because the spectrum of the hotspot emission is so steep towards this frequency regime .",
    "( 50,500)(0,0 ) ( -40,-85 )    ( 50,570)(0,0 ) ( -40,-45 )    ( 50,500)(0,0 ) ( -40,-85 )    ( 50,570)(0,0 ) ( -40,-45 )    if the @xmath7@xmath3 correlation arises in a way resembling that which we have modelled here , then it follows that hotspots with more powerful magnetic fields being fed by jets which transport higher powers , should themselves have steeper spectra than the hotspots in sources with lower jet - powers .",
    "such a finding has been pointed out by scheuer ( 1998 ) , that the pairs of hotspots in powerful radio sources have steeper spectra than those in less powerful sources .",
    "previous work [ e.g.  baldwin 1982 ] has shown that simple models of radio source evolution predict far more high @xmath7 , large @xmath42 sources than are actually observed .",
    "we are able to generate a distribution of points on the @xmath7@xmath42 plane which does not give rise to such a bulge .",
    "this is in part because the higher @xmath85 sources have steeper spectra and so are more easily lost below the survey flux - limits ; this is in addition to the effect whereby the sample selection process itself discriminates against sources which have suffered large adiabatic losses .",
    "we consider the question posed by jenkins & scheuer ( 1976 ) ` what docks the tails of radio source components ? ' .",
    "jenkins & scheuer found no evidence that the tails ( i.e.  bridge towards the core ) of radio sources were longer at low - frequency than at high - frequency , as might be expected if synchrotron losses play a major part in limiting the lengths of tails .",
    "we contend that a break in the energy spectrum of particles injected into the lobe is an increasingly relevant factor in depleting the bridges of radio sources in increasingly powerful sources .",
    "an alternative explanation is that the backflow speeds in these sources are too slow for lobe emission to ever reach the core ; a possible test between these two explanations is by consideration of the polarisation patterns in the lobes of these sources ( miller 1985 ) .",
    "inverse compton losses arising from the agn s own radiation field will also deplete the lobe emission close into the core ( see  [ sec : ownrf ] ) .",
    "application of a flux - limit to a survey means that at the lower luminosity edge there will be a tight correlation between luminosity and redshift .",
    "just how tight the upper edge of the correlation is depends on _",
    "( i ) _ the steepness and/or curvature of the distribution in jet - powers ( see equation  [ eq : qpars ] ) _ ( ii ) _ the proximity to the upper - limit of the distribution in jet - powers ( note how the 3c @xmath7@xmath8 distribution is much tighter than that of the 7c distribution comparing figures  [ fig : real3c ] and [ fig : real7c ] ) , _ ( iii ) _ the energy distribution of the particles injected into the lobes as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : lobe ] and _ ( iv ) _ the birth function itself .",
    "the lack of high redshift sources in 3c may arise in part because of an intrinsic maximum jet - power (= maximum black hole mass ) in these objects ( as discussed in willott et al .",
    "1998b ) .",
    "the tendency for radio sources with larger linear sizes to have steeper spectra , as seen in figure  [ fig : da ] , is not hard - wired into our simulations , yet it does appear ( e.g.  figure  [ fig : mock7c ] ) .",
    "we interpret this tendency as being due to the decrease in magnetic field as the lobes expand . for",
    "a fixed observing frequency , the lorentz factor of particles contributing most of their emission at this frequency will be higher for a lower magnetic field ( see equation  [ eq : lorentz ] ) . thus particles with a higher lorentz factor are required for the chosen emitting frequency and given the power - law exponent of typical energy distributions , the number of high lorentz factor particles is smaller than the number of less energetic particles .",
    "moreover , the adiabatic expansion process itself , while preserving the shape of the spectrum , will shift to lower frequencies any features in the spectrum such as a break frequency .",
    "each of the figures  [ fig : mock3c ] and [ fig : mock7c ] show ( bottom right hand corners ) plots of the ages of sources in the given simulated sample versus the redshifts .",
    "there is a very steep ( negative ) gradient seen in the distribution of points on these plots : objects close to a redshift of 2 have ages approaching two orders of magnitude smaller than objects in the local universe ; the correspondence in the simulated fainter sample ( figure  [ fig : mock7c ] ) is the same but less pronounced . we thus conclude that in any study of the importance of redshift to a given phenomenon , it is essential to take into account the fact that the higher the redshift at which an object is observed , the younger ( on average ) it is .",
    "two such issues where this is an important consideration are",
    "( i ) the higher distortion in radio structure of barthel and miley s ( 1988 ) high - redshift sample of steep - spectrum quasars compared with their low - redshift sample and ( ii ) the alignment effect [ mccarthy et al .",
    "1987 ; chambers , miley & van breugel 1987 ] .",
    "for case ( i ) barthel & miley suggested that at higher redshifts the environments of radio sources were more dense and inhomogeneous than at low redshift . in case",
    "( ii ) it has been proposed that the origin of the optical and infra - red light which is aligned with the radio axes arises either because of star - formation stimulated by the passage of the jet through the medium [ mccarthy et al.1987 ; rees 1989 ] or by quasar light escaping along the radio axes scattered into the line - of - sight by dust or electrons [ barthel 1989 ; fabian 1989 ] .",
    "sources which are younger may have the interactions of their jets occuring much closer in to the host galaxy where there is a higher density and likely greater inhomogeneity in the ambient matter ; thus it is possible that star - formation is more easily triggered here than at distances further out from the central engine and possible that the radio structures seen at these times are more distorted than those seen much later in the life of a radio source .",
    "although a young source is not necessarily a short source ( consider the derivative of equation  [ eq : falle ] ) , in the case of sources which are young but quite long on account of their high jet - power @xmath85 , the higher jet - power may well be more efficient at triggering star formation .",
    "we note dey et al.s ( 1997 ) spectropolarimetric study of 4c41.17 presents a compelling case for jet - triggered star formation in this young , high jet - power , radio galaxy at @xmath279 .",
    "moreover if it is the case that mergers of galaxies trigger radio galaxy or quasar activity ( see e.g.  sanders et al .",
    "1988 ) , then observations of young radio sources ( and thus those at high redshift ) will be revealing the emergence of a radio source through recent merger products .",
    "such an environment is more likely to be favourable to the triggering of star - formation than the rather more ` steady - state ' environment of a radio source which has been in existence for longer than @xmath280 years .",
    "consistent with this picture is the finding of best , longair and rttgering ( 1996 ) that the smallest sources in their sample of @xmath281 radio galaxies ( all with very similar luminosities ) are those which are most aligned with optical emission .",
    "best et al .  ( 1996 ) remarked that the sequence of changing optical aligned structure with increasing radio size could be naturally interpreted by comparing it with different phases of the interaction of the radio jets with the interstellar and intergalactic medium as the radio sources age .",
    "we have not needed to invoke any systematic change in the environments of radio sources with redshift in order to reproduce good approximations to the six planes in [ @xmath71 space from our observations .",
    "however , we note that garrington & conway ( 1991 ) found that there was a tendency for depolarisation to be higher in sources with a higher @xmath7 ( and hence @xmath8 , since their sample mainly comprised objects in the 3c sample or similar samples ) .",
    "it is possible that this is related to the above discussion : objects in their sample with higher @xmath7 or @xmath8 which are younger may well be in much more recently merged environments with the consequence that inhomogeneous regions of higher ambient density will more readily depolarise polarised intensity radiated from the lobes in these environments .",
    "note that a result of this work is that we are unavoidably driven to the conclusion that the high redshift sources we find in a radio survey are inevitably a younger population than their low redshift counterparts .",
    "comparison of the simulated samples in figures  [ fig : mock3c ] and [ fig : mock7c ] suggest that the strong dependence of age on redshift is alleviated significantly by studies using more than one complete sample e.g.  the new 7c redshift survey in tandem with the 3c sample .",
    "even if some details of our model are not fully correct and for example , the inclusion of a source into a survey is governed much more by its low - frequency emission being dominated by its hotspots than we infer to be the case on the basis of current data , then in order to avoid simulating an excess of very powerful large linear size radio sources over that which is seen , it would be necessary to invoke that sources at higher redshift have their beams switched on for shorter times .",
    "the `` youth  redshift degeneracy '' would then be truely hard - wired into the model .",
    "as it is , in our model the `` youth  redshift degeneracy '' arises because older sources do not survive above the survey flux - limit because the spectral losses due to ( especially ) inverse compton and also adiabatic expansion and synchrotron losses deplete the luminosity of an object at the relevant emitted frequency @xmath282 survey frequency ] .",
    "the model we have presented here , which reproduces the nature of radio sources which are included in low - frequency selected radio surveys , does not need to invoke the ` death ' of radio sources .",
    "this gives us a distribution in the _ ages _ of the sources which make it into our samples but does not require any strong statement about their _",
    "lifetimes_. it has been suggested that radio sources which are on death row should be seen as a population of sources which simply appear as widely separated pairs of `` naked hotspots '' .",
    "we suggest that this is unlikely : the inclusion of such objects into low - frequency ( e.g.  151 mhz ) surveys is most unlikely to be via their hotspots because , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : hslum ] hotspots do not radiate strongly at these low frequencies ; although such hotspots will radiate at frequencies like 1.4ghz [ e.g.  as in the first survey of becker et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ] it is most unlikely that emission will be found to link apparently unrelated isolated hotspots .",
    "_ new observational results _    the population of radio sources which are detected by a given survey _ can not _",
    "be naively identified with the _ real _ population of radio sources out there : our study of a number of complete samples of radio sources selected at frequencies close to 151 mhz , with a coverage of the luminosity  redshift plane which is substantially improved over previous studies , has led us to conclude that the principal dependences between properties of these radio sources selected in complete samples are as follows :    1 .",
    "the rest - frame spectral index at low - frequency depends on the luminosity of a source ( @xmath7@xmath3 correlation ) .",
    "2 .   the rest - frame spectral index at high - frequency ( ghz ) depends on the redshift of a source .",
    "observed - frame spectral indices are also governed by the redshift of a source .",
    "sources with larger physical sizes have steeper spectra ( @xmath42@xmath3 correlation ) . 5 .",
    "sources at higher redshift have smaller physical sizes ( @xmath42@xmath8 anti - correlation ) .",
    "we have presented an intuitive picture for the random interception of radio sources with our light - cone , which does not necessitate the use of assumptions concerning the dependences of the lifetimes of radio - sources . 7 .   the @xmath7@xmath3 correlation ( result 1 , listed above )",
    "can be understood if the hotspot is viewed as the _ governor _ of the energy distribution injected into the lobes of radio sources , and if the jet - power determines the magnetic field density in the hotspots .",
    "the @xmath42@xmath8 anti - correlation ( result 4 ) arises because of a more fundamental dependence , namely that the high - redshift sources in a given sample will be substantially younger than their low redshift counterparts , an effect which we call the ` youth  redshift degeneracy ' .",
