    "in the standard model(sm ) of an electroweak @xmath9 gauge theory with only one higgs doublet , the only source of cp violation comes from the complex yukawa coupling between higgs and fermion fields@xcite .",
    "since the higgs sector of sm is not well understood yet , many possible extensions of sm have been proposed@xcite .",
    "one of the simplest extensions of the sm is to simply add one higgs doublet without imposing the _ ad hoc _ discrete symmetries . for the convenience of mention in our following discussions",
    ", we may call such a minimal extension of the standard model with generally adding an extra higgs doublet as an s2hdm@xcite and assume cp violation solely originating from the higgs potential@xcite . the most general yukawa coupling and higgs potential",

    "once the discrete symmetry is adopted , the factor @xmath13 and @xmath14 in eq.(2 ) mush vanish . as a result",
    ", no cp violation can occur from @xmath15 .",
    "thus the only source of cp violation is the complex yukawa couplings , which lead to a phase in the cabibbo - kobayashi- maskawa(ckm ) quark mixing matrix .",
    "in contrast , one can replace the discrete symmetry by an approximate global family symmetry@xcite , thus the suppression of fcnc can be explained via the smallness of the off - diagonal terms .",
    "furthermore , when abondoning the discrete symmetries , one can obtain , after spontaneous symmetry breaking , rich sources of cp violation from a single relative phase between the two vacuum expectation values of higgs fields .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that even when the ckm matrix is real , the single phase arising from the spontaneous symmetry breaking can provide enough cp violation to meet the experimental measurments .",
    "one of particular important observations is a new source of cp violation in charged higgs boson interactions , which is independent of the ckm phase and can lead to a value of @xmath16 as large as @xmath17@xcite . in the s2hdm ,",

    "this possibility has been shown to happen in the case 3 , where @xmath219 is three times as large as @xmath220 .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied one of the simplest extentions of the standard model with an extra higgs doublet , which we have simply called as an s2hdm , some constraints on the parameters in the s2hdm have been obtained from @xmath35 mixing processes .",
    "it has been shown that in general @xmath127 and @xmath221 .",
    "a much larger @xmath36 mixing than the sm prediction is possible .",
    "various sources of cp violation have been discussed .",
    "their influences on the determination of the unitarity triangle have also been studied in detail .",
    "we found that angle @xmath3 of unitarity triangle could be largely suppressed due to the new contribution from higgs box diagrams .",
    "the phase from neutral higgs exchange could strongly affect the extraction of @xmath3 from @xmath222 . in some cases , such an effect could be so large that the unitarity triangle can not remain to be closed",
    ". in particular , it may even result in the angle @xmath3 determined from fitting the quantities @xmath5 , @xmath93 and @xmath7 being different from the one extracted from the decay process @xmath222 .",
