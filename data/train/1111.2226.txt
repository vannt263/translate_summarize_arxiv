    "the [ ii ] @xmath385756 line is strong and located in a spectral region with very few other lines . unlike [ iii ] @xmath384659 , there is no contamination to the red of [ ii ] @xmath385756 , making it ideal for demonstrating that there is no spatially - extended , red - shifted , broad high - ionization forbidden line emission .    of particular importance are the asymmetric shape and intensity of these emission arcs .",

    "emission above @xmath64 disappears .",
    "this phase dependence in the [ iii ] emission , especially the disappearance during periastron , strongly indicates that it is tied to the orbital motion of .",
    "another important observational feature is the presence of spatially - extended _ red - shifted _ emission to the nw , in addition to extended blue - shifted emission to the se , at phases far from periastron .",

    "the final set of observations focuses on changes with slit pa leading up to periastron .",
    "figures 12 and 13 of g09 illustrate the behavior of the [ iii ] emission for various slit pas at select phases .",
    "the key point to take away from this particular data set is that away from periastron , the spatially - extended [ iii ] emission is almost entirely blue - shifted for positive slit pas = @xmath65 to @xmath66 , but is partially red - shifted for negative pas , most notably pa = @xmath67 .",
    "table 3 of g09 lists the various forbidden emission lines observed in .",
    "however , there are several important reasons to focus particular attention on [ iii ] @xmath384659 emission .",
    "first , the physical mechanism for the formation of forbidden lines is well understood ( appendix b , online version ) .",
    "moreover , emission from forbidden lines is optically thin .",
    "thus , forbidden line radiation can escape from a nebula much more easily than radiation from an optically thick resonance line , which is emitted and reabsorbed many times @xcite .",
    "this is of great value when studying an object so enshrouded by circumstellar material since one does not have to model complicated radiative transfer effects .",

    "( verner et al . 2005 ; g09 ; mehner et al . 2010 ) .",
    "no intrinsic [ iii ] emission is expected from .",
    "this is based on detailed theoretical models by h01 and h06 , which show that in s envelope , fe@xmath68 only exists in regions where the electron density is two - to - four orders of magnitude higher than the critical density of the [ iii ] @xmath384659 line .",
    "since fe@xmath69 needs @xmath49 radiation ( or collisions ) to reach the fe@xmath68 state , most of the [ iii ] emission arises in areas directly photoionized by .    in comparison",
    ", fe@xmath69 only needs 7.9 ev radiation or collisions to ionize to fe@xmath70 , which can form in the wind of  ( without s influence ) and/or near the wind - wind interaction regions in areas excited by mid - uv radiation filtered by s dense wind .",
    "collisions and photoexcitation to upper fe@xmath70 energy levels can also populate many metastable levels . as a result , [ ii ]",
    "emission is far more complicated and originates from lower excitation , lower density regions on much larger spatial scales ( h01 ; h06 ; g09 ; mehner et al .",
    "because of this complexity , the modeling of [ ii ] emission is deferred to future work .",
    "the ip of 16.2 ev required for fe@xmath68 also means that the [ iii ] emission forms in regions where hydrogen is ionized , but helium is still neutral .",
    "in contrast , both ar@xmath68 and ne@xmath68 have ips greater than @xmath71 ev .",
    "therefore , [ iii ] and [ iii ] emission arise in areas where helium is singly ionized . modeling [ iii ]",
    "is thus more straightforward as one does not have to worry about the two different types of ionization structure possible ( one due to h and one due to he ) , which depend on the spectrum of ionizing radiation and the abundance of helium @xcite .",

    "the leading arm of the wwc zone ( including the portion that collides with the trailing arm ) helps to form a dense , compressed shell of primary wind that flows in the @xmath112 and @xmath197 directions after periastron passage . because the wind of  collides with a dense wall of postshock primary wind with high inertia , the primary wind controls the overall rate of expansion of the resulting spiral ( p11 ) .",
    "the overall stability of the expanding shell of primary wind on the apastron side of the system depends on the shock thickness ( vishniac 1983 ; wnsch et al . 2010 ; p11 ) .",

    "this collision produces instabilities at the interface between the two arms ( p11 ) , which , together with the shell s expansion , the pressure from s high - velocity wind , and the lack of bordering primary wind material for support , causes the shell to break apart in the @xmath199 direction @xmath203 years after periastron .",
    "while the term ` shell ' is used to describe the layer of compressed primary wind that flows in the direction of apastron following periastron passage , this is not related to the ` shell ejection ' event discussed in the past  literature @xcite .",
    "the scenario proposed by @xcite and advocated by @xcite to explain s spectroscopic events is a qualitative single - star model wherein some sort of thermal or surface instability is presumed to induce significant mass loss from  approximately every 5.54 years .",
    "a shell ejection as the result of a latitude - dependent disturbance in the wind of a single star has also been proposed @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the shell event may be triggered by the close approach of a secondary star , but this is still mainly a single - star scenario requiring some kind of surface instability in the primary .",
    "in contrast to these ideas , the formation of the outflowing shell of primary wind seen in the 3-d sph simulations is a natural , unavoidable consequence in any high - eccentricity , massive cwb in which the primary star has a significant mass - loss rate ( significant both in terms of overall mass - loss rate and mass - loss rate relative to the companion star ) .",
    "it is not so much an ` ejection ' event as it is a chance for the normal primary wind to flow in the direction of apastron for a brief time ( @xmath204 months ) while  performs periastron passage .",
    "eventually ,  returns to the apastron side and its high - velocity wind collides with and compresses this primary wind material , forming a dense shell that continues to propagate in the direction of apastron until it breaks apart at its weakest point , resulting in a pair of dense ` arcs ' , as described above .",

    "far - uv radiation from  leads to highly ionized regions that extend outward from its low density wind cavity in the direction of system apastron . during periastron passage",
    ", the disappearance of the extended high - ionization forbidden emission can be attributed to the wrapping of the dense primary wind around , which traps its far - uv radiation and prevents it from photoionizing the outer wind structures responsible for the observed emission .",
    "while  is embedded in s wind , the latter flows unimpeded in the direction of apastron , eventually forming dense arcs of material that expand outward as  completes periastron passage and the inner regions of the wwc zone regain their near conical shape .",
    "these cooler , dense arcs of expanding primary wind also produce high - ionization forbidden line emission when photoionized by .    observed temporal variations of the high - ionization forbidden lines can thus be linked to the orbital motion of  in its highly eccentric orbit , which causes different portions of the wwc regions and extended arcs of primary wind from earlier cycles to be photoionized .",
    "as the two stars move closer to or farther from each other , orbital motion also leads to changes in the density and temperature of the inner wwc zone , which in turn modifies the size and shape of s photoionization volume , and thus the overall shape , location , and intensity of the high - ionization forbidden line emission , even at phases away from periastron ( rows b , c , d , and f of figure [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "forbidden line emission from the compressed , inner wwc region increases in intensity until the critical density is reached or the temperature exceeds that at which the appropriate ions can exist .",

    "the proposed clockwise direction of s orbit is further supported by the images of @xcite , which show excess uv emission to the sw of  just before periastron , and to the ne just after .",
    "a complete review of all of the available observations of  and how they support the derived orientation and direction of the binary orbit is obviously not possible here .",

    "observational studies of the homunculus have firmly established that its polar axis is orientated on the sky at a @xmath306 , and that its inclination is @xmath307 @xcite . as shown in figure [ fig14 ] , the orbital axis of the  binary for our best - fit range of orientation parameters is closely aligned in 3-d with the homunculus polar axis .",

    "very large telescope ( vlt)/very large telescope interferometer ( vlti ) observations of the optically thick stellar wind of  by @xcite and @xcite also indicate that s wind could be prolate in shape and aligned at the same pa on the sky as the homunculus .",
    "many have interpreted these observational studies as evidence for the current - day wind of  being prolate , with a bipolar form and orientation similar to the homunculus .",
    "thus , one explanation offered for both the homunculus formation and the nature of the present - day wind is that  is a rapid rotator ( owocki & gayley 1997 ; maeder & meynet 2000 ; dwarkadas & owocki 2002 ; smith et al .",
    "2003a ; owocki , gayley , & shaviv 2004 ) ; the effects of gravity darkening on radiation - driven wind outflows from a rapidly rotating star suggested as a way of explaining both the high polar densities and velocities inferred in s extended wind .",

    "together , these new results challenge the idea that the present - day wind of  is latitudinally - dependent and prolate in shape .    in this context , it is noteworthy that the results in section 4 match the observations so well , given that the winds from both stars are assumed to be spherical in the 3-d simulations .",
    "new 3-d simulations with a latitudinal - dependent wind for , and comparison of the resulting spectro - images to the observations , may provide additional clues as to the nature of s present - day wind .",

    "this is another common assumption , with important implications for theories proposed to explain s spectroscopic events @xcite .",
    "future observations using diagnostics that are not significantly affected by  are needed to determine whether or not  is a rapid rotator , and whether its rotation axis is aligned with the orbital axis .",

    "wfpc2 observations by @xcite show that the minimum in the uv was much deeper ( again by about a factor of two ) for the 2009 event than for the 2003 event . while still the subject of debate , the behavior of [ ii ] @xmath384686 might have been different in 2009 as well , with a second ` outburst ' occurring @xmath311 after the first @xcite .",
    "the cause of this sudden change in the behavior of s spectroscopic event is still poorly understood .",
    "one proposed explanation is that the mass - loss rate of  has suddenly decreased by at least a factor of two ( c10 ; c11 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , this is far from confirmed and the exact reasons for such a drop are unknown .",
    "the results in this paper suggest a possible way to observationally test the idea that s mass - loss rate has recently changed .",
    "all of the _",
    "hst_/stis observations modeled were taken in or before 2004 .",
    "the model in this paper assumes a mass - loss rate of @xmath312 for , which is based on earlier observational and modeling studies ( davidson & humphreys 1997 ; h01 ; h06 ) . the good match between the synthetic spectro - images and the observations suggests that the mass - loss rate of  was @xmath313 at the time the observations were taken .",
    "the results in section 4 though are strongly dependent on the mass - loss rate assumed for  and the ionizing flux of photons assumed for .",
    "if the ionizing flux of photons from  remains constant , but the mass - loss rate of  drops by a factor of two or more , the size of the photoionization region should increase considerably .",
    "therefore , the spatial extent and flux of the observed high - ionization forbidden lines should also drastically change .",
    "the phase dependence of the forbidden emission would likely differ , with the high - ionization emission vanishing at later phases ( compared to earlier orbital cycles ) when going into periastron , and reappearing at earlier phases afterward . observed variations with slit pa should be different too , possibly showing longer spatially - extended structures , and even new components at different @xmath171 .",
    "changes in the wind terminal velocity of  could be similarly investigated using the maximum observed @xmath171 of the spatially - extended emission .",
    "multi - epoch observations coupled with improved 3-d radiative transfer modeling of the high - ionization forbidden line emission would also help in determining if there is a significant change in s ionizing flux of photons , mass - loss rate , or wind terminal speed .",
    "constraints on the ionizing flux of photons from  could be compared to stellar models for a range of o @xcite and wr @xcite stars , allowing one to obtain a luminosity and temperature for .",
    "a major goal of this paper has been to use the 3-d dynamical model and available _",
    "hst_/stis observations of high - ionization forbidden lines to constrain the absolute 3-d orientation and direction of s binary orbit .",
    "the spatially - resolved spectroscopic observations obtained with the /stis provide the crucial spatial _ and _ velocity information needed to help accomplish this . since the forbidden lines do not have an absorption component",
    ", they provide a clear view throughout s extended interacting winds .",
    "each high - ionization forbidden line arises _ only _ in regions where ( 1 ) photoionization by  can produce the required ion , ( 2 ) the density is near the line s critical density , and ( 3 ) the material is at the appropriate temperature .",
    "our results are therefore not as dependent on the many complicated details and effects encountered when modeling other forms of emission and/or absorption , such as x - rays or spectral features of i , i , or other species ( h01 ; h06 ; nielsen et al . 2007b ; p11 ) .    synthetic spectro - images of [ iii ] emission line structures generated using 3-d sph simulations of s binary wwc and radiative transfer codes were compared to the available /stis",
    "observations for a variety of orbital phases and stis slit pas .",
    "the model spectro - images provide important details about the physical mechanisms responsible for the observed high - ionization forbidden line emission , as well as the location and orientation of the observed emitting structures .",
    "below , we summarize our key conclusions and outline the direction of future work .",
    "1 .   large - scale ( @xmath314 ) 3-d sph simulations of s binary colliding winds show that during periastron passage , the dense wind of  flows unimpeded in the direction of system apastron ( figure [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "following periastron , s high - velocity wind collides with this primary wind material , creating dense shells that expand outward during s 5.5-year orbital cycle .",
    "these shells eventually fragment , forming a pair of dense , spatially - extended ` arcs ' of primary wind on the apastron side of the system .",
    "after several orbital cycles , the arcs drop in density and mix with the surrounding low - density wind material from . 2 .   during",
    "most of s orbit , far - uv radiation from  photoionizes a significant , spatially - extended region on the apastron side of the system , including portions of the dense arcs of primary wind formed following periastron ( figure [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "portions of the current wwc region and primary wind just beyond it are also photoionized by .",
    "the density and temperature of the material in these regions are ideal for producing [ iii ] emission ( figure [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "3 .   during periastron passage ,",
    "becomes enveloped in the dense wind of .",
    "this significantly reduces the size of the photoionization region , to approximately a few semi - major axes in diameter . since the large photoionization region has ` collapsed ' , the spatially - extended ( @xmath46 ) high - ionization forbidden line emission vanishes during periastron passage ( @xmath315 ) . it does not reappear until  completes periastron passage and restores the extended photoionization region , which can take several months",
    "synthetic spectro - images of [ iii ] @xmath384659 show that most of the [ iii ] emission originates in the central @xmath302 , in agreement with figure  8 of @xcite .",
    "our 3-d model shows that this emission forms in photoionized material near the current wwc zone , which is not spatially - resolved by /stis .",
    "spatially - extended ( @xmath316 ) [ iii ] emission arises in photoionized portions of the expanding arcs of primary wind formed just after periastron passage .",
    "only spectro - images generated for lines - of - sight angled @xmath317 to @xmath7 prograde of the semi - major axis on the apastron side of the system are able to match the observations taken at @xmath42 , slit @xmath215 .",
    "however , there is an ambiguity in the orbital inclination @xmath1 , with models for @xmath318 to @xmath256 , @xmath217 to @xmath218 and @xmath319 to @xmath5 , @xmath220 to @xmath221 both able to produce entirely blue - shifted arcs ( figure [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "model spectro - images of multi - phase observations obtained at slit @xmath57 break the above degeneracy in @xmath1 , fully constraining s orbital orientation parameters . given the uncertainties in some of the stellar / wind parameters used in the 3-d modeling ,",
    "_ our suggested best - fit range of orientation parameters for the  binary system are _",
    "@xmath4 to @xmath5 , @xmath6 to @xmath7 , @xmath258 to @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , _ the orbital axis of the  binary system is closely aligned in 3-d with the homunculus polar axis , with apastron on the observer s side of the system and  orbiting clockwise on the sky relative to _ ( figure [ fig14 ] ) .",
    "all other orbital orientations , including that in which  is in front of  at periastron ( @xmath240 ) , are explicitly ruled out as they produce model spectro - images that lack entirely blue - shifted , spatially - extended arcs , containing instead significant amounts of unobserved , spatially - extended red - shifted emission at @xmath42 , slit @xmath215 ( figure [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "the 3-d model predicts that the orientation on the sky of the blue - shifted component of [ iii ] @xmath384659 should not vary much during s orbit , stretching from ne to sw .",
    "however , the spatial extent of the emission should grow larger as the system moves from periastron to apastron , and decrease in size close to periastron",
    ". the orientation and spatial extent of the red - shifted component should behave in a way similar to that of the blue - shifted component , but pointing nw on the sky .",
    "the apparent alignment of the orbital axis and homunculus polar axis implies a link between binarity and s numerous massive eruptions .",
    "binary interaction scenarios should be seriously considered as possible explanations for the great eruption and formation of the bipolar homunculus , and possibly the smaller eruption in 1890 that formed the little homunculus . 10 .",
    "future detailed 3-d simulations and radiative transfer calculations , together with high - resolution spatial mapping of the high - ionization forbidden line emission with _",
    "hst_/stis , have the potential to further constrain the temperature and luminosity of .",
    "the strong dependence of the forbidden line emission on the mass - loss rate of  and ionizing flux of photons from  may provide clues as to the nature of s long - term variability , specifically , the cycle - to - cycle variations of the spectroscopic events .    the 3-d dynamical modeling in this paper and",
    "the available _",
    "spectral observations have increased our understanding of the  system .",
    "much work remains , however .",
    "efforts are underway to improve both the 3-d hydrodynamical modeling and 3-d radiative transfer approach .",
    "new 3-d simulations that include radiative cooling , radiation - driven stellar winds , gravity , and effects like radiative inhibition and braking are on the horizon .",
    "preliminary results of detailed 3-d radiative transfer calculations using ` simplex ` @xcite are promising as well . with these new tools at our disposal , it should be possible to further constrain the stellar , wind , and orbital parameters of , setting the stage for orbital modeling to determine the stellar masses .",
