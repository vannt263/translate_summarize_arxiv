    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are interacting binary stars containing a white dwarf accreting material from a low - mass main sequence star via an accretion disc or stream .",
    "theoretical studies have consistently predicted that the population of cvs should be dominated by short - period systems , with many piling up up at a minimum period of 6070 minutes ( kolb 1993 ; politano 1996 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the known population of cvs , visciously biased by observational selection effects , bears no resemblance to theoretical predictions ( ritter & kolb 2003 ) .",
    "we are therefore undertaking a project to characterise the population of cvs discovered by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ( szkody et al .",
    ", 2002 - 6 ) .",
    "this sample was identified spectroscopically and extends to faint magnitudes , so is much less biased than all previous samples .",
    "we have identified the first cvs known to have a secondary star of brown dwarf mass ( southworth et al . , 2006 ; littlefair et al . , 2006a , 2008 ) , and for the first time are finding evidence for the long - predicted pile - up at the minimum period ( gnsicke et al . , 2008 ) .",
    "the orbital period distribution of the sdss cvs is compared to the distribution for the previously known cvs in fig.[fig : pd1 ] .",

    "our work on the sdss population of cvs is intended to shed light on how these weird objects evolve .",

    "sdssj2205 has twice been observed to vary in brightness ( woudt & warner 2004 ; szkody et al . , 2007 ) , with periods of 575s , 475s and 330s and amplitudes of @xmath010mmag , which is typical of zzceti - type nonradial pulsations .",
    "over two nights in 2008 august we obtained a light curve with the ntt .",
    "we were unable to detect these pulsations to a limit of 5mmag , but instead found a previously unseen photometric period of 44.8min .",
    "our vlt spectroscopy yielded an orbital period of @xmath1min ( southworth et al . , 2008a ) .",
    "the vanishing pulsation periods can not be attributed to destructive interference or changes in accretion rate , but may be explicable by changes in the white dwarf temperature or the surface visibility of the pulsation modes .",
    "we obtained 29 spectra of sdssj0039 over two nights in 2007 august using vlt / fors2 , finding an orbital period of @xmath3min .",
    "the spectra of this system show a remarkable and unique triple emission peak at h@xmath4 ( southworth et al . , 2008c ) .",
    "we have used the technique of doppler tomography ( marsh & horne 1988 ) to generate velocity maps of the emission .",
    "these show that the inner peak moves in velocity with an amplitude of 180kms@xmath5 , so can not easily be attributed to either the white dwarf , secondary star , or accretion disc .",
    "its existence remains a mystery .",
    "the h@xmath4 doppler maps also show that the accretion disc is very elliptical , which is not expected for a system in a state of very low mass transfer .",
    "finally , there is also strong emission from the accretion disc in the [ @xmath6,@xmath7 quadrant , which has been seen in some ultra - compact binaries but is very odd for standard hydrogen - rich cvs .",
    "these aspects of sdssj0039 defy explanation in the current picture of the properties of cvs , and demand further follow - up observations .",
