    "lyapunov exponents ( les ) @xmath4 are the most powerful tool for a detailed characterization of chaotic dynamics  @xcite : they allow determining the number of unstable directions , the kolmogorov - sinai entropy , the fractal dimension and other dynamical invariants .",
    "the number of les equals the number of degrees of freedom @xmath5 .",
    "the les , ordered from the largest to the smallest one , define the so - called spectrum of les . in spatially extended systems , @xmath6 ( where @xmath2 is the system linear size and @xmath7 is the dimensionality of the space ) ; in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath8 ) the lyapunov spectrum converges to an asymptotic curve , that is specific to each system and depends only on @xmath9 .",
    "the existence of such a limit shape is taken as the proof of extensivity , i.e. that quantities like the fractal dimension or the kolmogorov ",
    "sinai entropy are proportional to the system volume .",
    "the les quantify the exponential expansion ( contraction ) growth rates along the @xmath5 covariant or characteristic directions in the infinite - time limit .",
    "in fact , tangent space can be decomposed into covariant subspaces and the corresponding vector - base provides relevant information that is encoded in the so - called characteristic / covariant lyapunov vectors ( lvs )  @xcite .",
    "these vectors actually contribute to identify the local structure of the invariant measure , to uncover the possible presence of collective phenomena  @xcite , to determine the dimension of the inertial manifold  @xcite , or to detect spurious les observed in embedded time series  @xcite , to cite a few applications .    in a time interval @xmath10 ,",
    "an infinitesimal perturbation pointing along the @xmath11-th lv is expanded / contracted in tangent space by a factor @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the so - called expansion rate . as a result of the variable degree of instability in phase - space , @xmath13 fluctuates along the trajectory ( or , equivalently , across phase - space ) .",
    "nevertheless , the finite - time lyapunov exponent ( ftle ) @xmath14 converges , in the infinite - time limit , to the @xmath11-th le , @xmath15 , where brackets indicate an average over trajectories  @xcite ( hereafter , phase - space average and time average are assumed to coincide ) .",
    "it is natural to ask how the ftle fluctuations scale with both time and system size .",
    "as already argued in @xcite , this question is not only connected with the convergence to the thermodynamic limit , but also with the extensivity of space - time chaos . the best way to approach",
    "the problem is by introducing the ( time - dependent ) variances , @xmath16 and the corresponding diffusion coefficients , @xmath17 it is expected that for large - enough times , the distribution @xmath18 of ftles [ @xmath19 is described by a suitable large - deviation function , @xmath20 $ ] , and @xmath21 . under the fairly general assumption that the les fluctuations are short - range in time , ( this is typically true away from bifurcations and phase transitions )",
    ", the central limit theorem implies that @xmath22 has a quadratic structure around its minimum , i.e. that @xmath18 is gaussian , @xmath23 \\ , , \\label{gaussian}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 denotes the transpose , while the matrix @xmath25 is the inverse of the symmetric diffusion matrix , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath26 .",
    "thus , within the gaussian approximation , @xmath27 describes how strong ftle fluctuations are for a given system size .",
    "in particular , the diagonal elements @xmath28 correspond to the diffusion coefficient of the expansion rates @xmath29 around the average growth @xmath30 .",
    "chaos extensivity would naively suggest that the diffusion coefficients should scale as @xmath31 with the system size .",
    "based on the numerical simulation of a variety of systems in @xmath32 kuptsov and politi  @xcite , have however found that @xmath33 with a wandering exponent that is smaller than 1 : @xmath34 for @xmath35 , while @xmath36 for @xmath37 . at the same time",
    ", it was found that the off - diagonal terms decay as @xmath38 and so do the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath27 , in agreement with the expectation for an extensive chaotic dynamics .",
    "it is rather intriguing that although the matrix @xmath27 becomes increasingly diagonal in the thermodynamic limit , its diagonal terms scale differently from the matrix eigenvalues  @xcite . in the absence of theoretical arguments ,",
    "one can not a priori exclude that the scaling behavior of the bulk of the spectrum is affected by strong finite - size corrections , so that @xmath39 as @xmath8 .",
    "we shed some light on this problem by resorting to the well - known connection between lv dynamics and the kinetics of rough surfaces .",
    "this allows unveiling a theoretical connection between the scaling properties of the ftles fluctuations and the velocity fluctuations of rough surfaces subject to stochastic forces .",
    "this mapping leads to a scaling relation between the universal roughening exponents and the ftle wandering exponent @xmath3 , which thus turns out to be a true critical exponent .",
    "more specifically , in section ii , we develop the theoretical scaling arguments which lead us to derive the relevant mathematical relationships . in section iii ,",
    "our systematic investigation of the maximal lyapunov exponent confirms the theoretical expectations as well as the relationship with kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) dynamics  @xcite .",
    "section iv is devoted to the entirely new analysis of the bulk of the spectrum which suggests the correspondence with some yet unknown stochastic field theory . finally , in section",
    "v , we summarize the main results and briefly discuss the open problems .",
    "in this section we focus on the scaling behavior of the diagonal elements @xmath28 of the matrix @xmath27 . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "from now on , we drop the index @xmath11 in the formulas and reintroduce it in the next sections , when it will be necessary to distinguish between different values of the integrated density @xmath9 .    in the following",
    "we show that @xmath1 , where the exponent @xmath3 can be expressed in terms of the scaling properties of the corresponding lv , @xmath40 .",
    "our scaling theory is based upon the well - known interpretation of the dynamics of a lv as the statistical evolution of a rough surface  @xcite .    for each given lv @xmath41",
    "we define an associated `` surface '' field @xmath42 through the logarithmic transformation latexmath:[$h({\\bm",
    "x},t ) = \\ln    rough and scale - invariant  @xcite .",
    "as we are interested in the expansion factor of the lv over a time interval @xmath10 , it is useful to introduce the field @xmath44 which corresponds to the logarithm of the finite - time expansion factor ( over a time @xmath10 ) . the fluctuations around the average surface position at any given time are quantified by the surface width @xmath45 , @xmath46 where the angular brackets denote an average over an ensemble of different trajectories , while the overline is a spatial average ( here and in the following ) .",
    "scale invariance generically leads to finite - size scaling of surface fluctuations that can be cast in the typical scaling form  @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a dynamical scaling function , which reaches asymptotically ( @xmath49 ) a constant value and grows as @xmath50 for small values of @xmath51 .",
    "all of the above means that at short times @xmath52 grows as @xmath53 , until @xmath54 when @xmath52 saturates to a size - dependent value @xmath55 .",
    "the roughness exponent @xmath56 and the dynamic exponent @xmath57 quantify space - time correlations and fully characterize the statistical and dynamical behavior of the surface ( equivalently , the lv . )      before proceeding with the details of the theoretical derivation , we anticipate our main result , _",
    "i.e. _ that for any ftle its variance @xmath58 [ defined by with @xmath59 scales as @xmath60 where @xmath61 . by then comparing this formula with eq .",
    ", this implies that the le diffusion coefficient scales as @xmath62 so that the wandering exponent @xmath3 heuristically observed in ref .",
    "@xcite is a truly critical exponent , connected to the lv surface roughening exponents , @xmath63 as a result , @xmath3 can be determined , once the roughening exponents of the corresponding surfaces are known .",
    "this is valid for any spatial dimension @xmath7 .",
    "we now derive eq .   and give further details on the scaling of the diagonal elements of @xmath27 in the intermediate regime before saturation . first , let us notice that the expansion rate @xmath65 necessarily refers to some norm in tangent space .",
    "the norm selection is irrelevant for the calculation of dynamical invariant quantities like the les or the diffusion coefficient @xmath27 , as they involve an infinite - time limit .",
    "however , the finite - time expansion rates @xmath65 depend explicitly on the norm .",
    "given a perturbation @xmath41 , a rather broad family of @xmath66-norms can be defined as follows @xmath67^{1/q}.\\ ] ] the standard euclidean norm corresponds to @xmath68 .",
    "in the following , our theoretical arguments will be developed with reference to the 0-norm : @xmath69 , unless otherwise specified .",
    "the 0-norm is the most convenient and natural choice because , in this framework , computing the lv norm corresponds to determining the average height of the surface @xmath70 , while the ftle corresponds to the surface velocity , so that @xmath71 which , by definition ( [ phi ] ) , corresponds to the net displacement of the average surface position in a time interval @xmath10 .",
    "now , by combining eqs .",
    "( [ chiij ] ) and ( [ eq : lambda2 ] ) one obtains @xmath72 this expression , like eq .   for @xmath52 , is a quadratic correlation function of @xmath73 and , therefore , it should scale as @xmath74 consistency with eq .",
    "requires that @xmath75 diverges linearly with time .",
    "this information can be included in the above equation , by writing the scaling function as a product , @xmath76 , where @xmath77 saturates for @xmath49 .",
    "altogether , this leads to eq .   and the main relation   for the scaling behavior of the asymptotic diffusion coefficient .",
    "although our theoretical arguments are based on the use of the 0-norm , this does not affect the validity of our main scaling relation   as , in the infinite - time limit , the diffusion coefficient @xmath0 is actually a dynamical invariant , independent of the norm used .    before saturation sets in ( @xmath78 ) , the effective diffusion coefficient is time - dependent and exhibits long - range temporal correlations .",
    "these correlations are important , since they correspond to an anomalous diffusion of the expansion rate @xmath79 , as it can be inferred by looking at the  short - time \" behavior of the dynamic scaling function @xmath77 in eq .  , _",
    "i.e. _ for @xmath80 .",
    "we indeed find that , still in the 0-norm framework , @xmath81 let us now show how this result arises from a simple scaling argument . at short times , correlations only extend over a linear distance of order @xmath82 so that the system can be considered as formed by a number @xmath83 of statistically independent blocks .",
    "accordingly , we can write @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the local ( intra - block ) fluctuation . from eq .  , we can now estimate @xmath86 @xmath87 so that @xmath88 for @xmath78 . by then recalling that @xmath89 in this time regime , we finally obtain eq .  .",
    "this concludes our scaling analysis .",
    "it is worth to remark that , contrary to the asymptotic behavior , eq .   is valid only with reference to the 0-norm",
    "this is because , while the stationary diffusion coefficient implies an infinite - time limit , the time - dependent effective diffusion coefficient is defined for @xmath90 .",
    "this will become evident later on from the comparison with numerical calculations with both the 0-norm and the euclidean norm .",
    "let us finally mention that the scaling function eq",
    ".   arises also in the context of the nonequilibrium roughening , where it describes the velocity - fluctuations  @xcite of a driven interface .",
    "it is well known that for a wide class of extended dynamical systems , which include coupled - map lattices , lorenz-96 model , kuramoto - sivashinsky equation , and many others  @xcite the lv surface @xmath42 associated with the first lv belongs to the universality class of kpz  @xcite .",
    "the universality class of kpz in extended dynamical systems is , therefore , very large and includes models which , in spite of relevant differences in the microscopic details , share a universal behavior of the first lv .",
    "this universality class seems to include all dissipative models with short - range interactions as well as some symplectic models .",
    "therefore , we expect @xmath91 to be characterized by the same wandering exponent , for all models in the kpz universality class . for instance , in @xmath32 one can plug the exact values @xmath92 and @xmath93 in eq .   to obtain @xmath36 .    regarding the wandering exponent in the bulk",
    "les ( @xmath94 ) , it is known that the corresponding lv surfaces are characterized by a different set of scaling exponents .",
    "this issue has been much investigated in the last few years .",
    "numerical simulations in @xmath32 suggest that the dynamic exponent is @xmath95  @xcite , and this result is also supported by theoretical arguments  @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath96 has been found to be much smaller than that in kpz , lying in the range 0.15 - 0.2  @xcite .",
    "our main relation in eq .   suggests a wandering exponent @xmath97-@xmath98 for the diffusion of the bulk les that is consistent with the numerical observations in ref .",
    "in this and the next section we compare our theoretical predictions with detailed numerical simulations of several systems . here",

    "@xmath100 was also observed in ref .",
    "@xcite where the euclidean norm was used to measure vector metrics in tangent space , instead of the 0-norm considered in this paper .",
    "this confirms that the norm choice does not affect the stationary behavior . at shorter times ,",
    "finite - size corrections are more sizable , but one can nevertheless appreciate an increasing quality of the data collapse with @xmath2 . the initial slope increases with @xmath2 and approaches the theoretical prediction @xmath110 .",
