    "the general theory of relativity asserts that the familiar force of gravity is fundamentally a manifestation of the geometry of space - time , which is given curvature by massive objects .",
    "many measurements of observable quantities which are influenced by space - time curvature have confirmed the validity of the einstein equivalence principle  the foundation on which all metric theories of gravity are based  and the apparent correctness of general relativity as the specific metric theory  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , because of the importance of space - time and gravity to our understanding of the universe , opportunities for improved precision and new tests continue to be sought  @xcite .",
    "the most stringent tests of general relativity have been obtained from measurements of the time delay of an electromagnetic wave as it passes by a massive object .",
    "although this effect is a natural consequence of the equivalence principle and the curvature of space , it was not called out by einstein and was first described by irwin i. shapiro in 1964 in the context of timing radar pulses reflected from venus and mars at superior conjunction  @xcite .",
    "the extra one - way time delay due to general relativity is @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the mass of the sun , @xmath2 is the speed of light , @xmath3 is the gravitational constant , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the orbital radii of the earth and the target planet , and @xmath6 is the distance of closest approach of the radar beam to the center of the sun ( assumed here to be much smaller than @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) . for a radar reflection from venus at the edge of the sun",
    ", this amounts to a one - way time delay of @xmath7  ms .",
    "the time delay may be different in alternative theories of gravity . in the parametrized post - newtonian ( ppn )",
    "formalism for arbitrary metric theories  @xcite , the time delay is @xmath8 in the @xmath9 factor , the 1 reflects the gravitational red - shift and is fixed for any metric theory of gravity , while the @xmath10 measures the net curvature of space produced by the mass along the path of the light or radio waves  @xcite . for general relativity , @xmath11 , reproducing shapiro s result .",
    "the possible deviation of @xmath10 from unity has been limited by radar ranging to venus , mars , and spacecraft , as well as by timing the radio pulses from isolated and binary pulsars  @xcite ; see  @xcite for a more recent summary of measurements .",
    "the most precise measurement was made using the cassini spacecraft on its way to saturn with a doppler technique , yielding @xmath10@xmath12@xmath13  @xcite .",
    "the same @xmath9 factor governs the angular deflection of light passing near the sun , and very - long - baseline radio interferometry ( vlbi ) has been used to measure @xmath10@xmath12@xmath14  @xcite .",
    "lunar laser ranging also is sensitive to @xmath10 in combination with other ppn parameters  @xcite .",
    "the sun produces a measurable time delay at its edge despite the fact that most of its mass is located hundreds of thousands of kilometers away from the path of the radio beam .",
    "we may wonder whether smaller objects produce time delays for smaller separation distances according to the same model , _",
    "i.e. _  the same effective value of @xmath10 .",
    "the ppn formalism does not allow for such a scale dependence , but there is no experimental evidence one way or the other for short distance scales .",
    "what time delay magnitude could we produce on a laboratory scale using a @xmath1510-ton mass , say ?",
    "as a back - of - the - envelope calculation , utilizing with @xmath16 = @xmath17  kg , @xmath18  km , and @xmath19  m , we estimate that @xmath20  s. remarkably , variations in that time delay due to _ changes _ in @xmath6 can be detected using a suitable laser interferometer  for instance , one of the advanced ligo  @xcite gravitational - wave detectors  as we will discuss in section  [ sec : laserinterferometers ] below .",
    "if the distance from the mass to the beam changes from @xmath21 to @xmath22 , the resulting change in time delay is @xmath23 thus , we can spin a massive object near the interferometer beam to modulate the time delay and then coherently integrate the signal over a long time period . figure  [ fig : conceptualdrawing ] is a sketch which illustrates this basic concept .        in section  [ sec : rotatingmassdesign ]",
    ", we discuss the design considerations for the rotating mass and present a specific example design which is sufficient to make an interesting measurement of the time delay , as described in section  [ sec : signalanalysis ] .",
    "we briefly examine several possible systematic effects and implementation issues in sections  [ sec : systematics ] and [ sec : engineering ] and then conclude with a discussion of how future interferometers could make better measurements possible .",
    "direct detection of gravitational waves  @xcite is the primary goal of modern interferometric gravitational wave detectors such as ligo  @xcite , virgo  @xcite , geo600  @xcite , tama300  @xcite and clio  @xcite which have successfully collected a few years of high - sensitivity data so far .",
    "second - generation gravitational wave detectors now being designed and constructed  namely advanced ligo  @xcite , advanced virgo  @xcite and the large - scale cryogenic gravitational - wave telescope ( lcgt )  @xcite  will greatly extend the reach for gravitational wave signals .",
    "each of these detectors is capable of measuring extremely small changes in the effective length difference of its two perpendicular `` arms '' , as would be induced by a passing gravitational wave .",
    "however , they can also be viewed as unique `` laboratory '' instruments capable of measuring induced displacements at the @xmath24 level , equivalent to time delays of @xmath25 , for integration times of order one year .",
    "this feature opens up new possibilities for fundamental science . while gravitational wave searches target signals with various durations , and either accurately - known or unknown waveforms , precision experiments in which the light travel time in one of the interferometer arms is modulated at a given frequency in a well - controlled manner can enjoy all the benefit of sensitive lock - in experimental techniques and extended integration times .",
    "advanced ligo will consist of three @xmath26 interferometric detectors at the two existing ligo sites : the hanford observatory in washington state ( home to two detectors ) and the livingston observatory in louisiana .",
    "( a proposed alternative plan , to install one of the three advanced ligo detectors at the gingin site in australia , leaving just one at hanford , is under consideration at the time of this writing . )",
    "the detectors will be installed beginning in 2011 and are expected to be fully operational around 2015 , ultimately reaching an order of magnitude lower strain noise than the initial ligo detectors .",
    "the advanced ligo detector design has a beam splitter and suspended mirrors ( test masses ) at the ends of its orthogonal arms , as well as additional partially - transmitting mirrors , to form a power- and signal - recycled michelson interferometer with fabry - perot arm cavities .",
    "a gravitational wave induces a time - dependent metric strain on the detector which changes the relative lengths of the arms .",
    "while acquiring scientific data , feedback to the mirror positions and to the laser frequency keeps the optical cavities near resonance , so that interference in the light from the two 4  km long arms recombining at the beam splitter depends on the difference between the lengths of the two arms modulated by the signal to be measured .",
    "a photodiode senses the light , and a digitized signal is recorded .",
    "then the data are calibrated and converted into a strain time series .",
    "the detectors have a sensitive frequency band extending from a few tens of hz to a few khz , as shown in figure  [ fig : sensitivitycurves ] , limited at low frequencies by seismic noise and radiation pressure noise and at high frequencies by laser shot noise .",
    "third - generation detectors are envisioned to push the limits of ground - based interferometry and will likely be limited at low frequencies by newtonian gravity - gradient noise  @xcite .",
    "since laser interferometers like ligo have essentially no sensitivity at dc , it is necessary to modulate the shapiro delay by changing the effective distance between the beam and the relevant mass . the easiest way to achieve",
    "this is a rotating mass system . in this section",
    "we describe one possible design for a device with two `` arms '' extending from the rotation axis that would provide a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of @xmath278 for one year of integration with advanced ligo .",
    "( there is no plan at this time to actually construct and operate such a device , but it could be considered as an addition to advanced ligo or another interferometer in the future . )    as indicated by , the geometry of the rotating mass setup enters only logarithmically into the shapiro delay , while the mass enters linearly .",
    "the closest effective distance of the mass to beam , @xmath22 , is constrained by their finite cross - sectional sizes . as a consequence",
    "it is hard to reduce the required mass by optimizing the rotating mass geometry .",
    "for the example design we assume a mass of @xmath28 for each of the two arms",
    ".    one of the limiting factors is the tensile strength of the material holding the rotating mass together .",
    "this of course favors low spin frequencies , and therefore requires a laser interferometer with good low - frequency sensitivity . in the case of advanced ligo",
    "we would like to have the primary harmonic at about @xmath29 , well separated from known instrumental lines in the detector noise spectrum .",
    "thus , a baseline design with two arms must rotate at @xmath30 .",
    "note that this is still much slower than the inverse light travel time for all relevant distances ; thus a static calculation of the shapiro delay is still appropriate .",
    "a rotating mass system design with more arms would have a lower spin frequency , but in order to preserve the size of the variation of the shapiro delay , one would have to increase the radius by the same factor . since the whole rotating mass system needs to spin in vacuum and it must fit next to the beam tube we choose @xmath31 as the maximal practical rotating mass radius and stay with the conceptually simpler two - arm design and a @xmath30 spin frequency , even though one might win a factor of two in required tensile strength by going to 4 arms .    with these parameters the rotating mass structure needs to support a centrifugal force of about @xmath32  n. a simple rectangular slab of steel , tungsten or titanium",
    "is not strong enough , and only a fraction of the mass would pass close to the laser beam .",
    "a better way to build a rotating mass system with the necessary strength is to concentrate the mass near the ends of the arms , with a light - weight central support structure for suspension , and an outer shell of carbon fiber composite .",
    "figure [ fig : rotatingmass - model ] shows a sketch of this rotating mass design , including the key dimensions . with a carbon fiber",
    "composite cross - sectional area of @xmath33 ( @xmath34 thickness on both sides and @xmath35 cumulative rotating mass length along the axis of rotation ) this requires a tensile strength of @xmath36 .",
    "a composite such as hextow im9 from hexcel corporation  @xcite , for example , provides a factor of 5 safety margin on this .",
    "another constraint on the geometry of the setup , specifically the length of the interferometer arms , comes from the direct gravitational coupling from the rotating mass to the test masses .",
    "a good place to put the rotating mass is near the middle of one interferometer arm .",
    "the test mass acceleration at the fundamental spin frequency @xmath37 cancels due to the symmetry of the rotating mass , while the acceleration variation at @xmath38 has amplitude @xmath39 where @xmath16 is the mass of one arm , @xmath40 is the rotating mass radius , @xmath6 its minimal separation from the laser beam , and @xmath41 is the interferometer arm length . for a @xmath30 spin frequency and including the acceleration of both test masses of the interferometer arm the length change at @xmath42 has amplitude @xmath43 since the size of the shapiro delay is on the order of the schwarzschild radius @xmath44 of one of the arm masses , divided by @xmath2 , any laboratory - scale interferometer ( @xmath45 or less ) would require an extremely precise cancellation mechanism . for the @xmath46 arm length of ligo",
    "this coupling is down by more than 6 orders of magnitude .",
    "for a given rotating mass , such as the one described in the previous section , it is straightforward to numerically calculate the gravitational potential @xmath47 at every point in its vicinity . a light ray which passes near the rotating mass experiences a total time delay which is simply given by @xmath48 where the integral is along the path of the light ray  @xcite .",
    "the light also experiences angular deflection during its passage , but for this system the deflection is only of order @xmath27@xmath49  rad .",
    "the slightly increased length of the path due to this deflection is quadratic in the angle , and thus has a negligible effect on the time delay calculation .",
    "therefore we may take the light path to be straight in the @xmath50 direction ( along the laser beam ) and calculate the integrated time delay as a function of its transverse position when it passes by the rotating mass . also , because the potential is additive , the spatial extent of the rotating mass in the @xmath50 direction does not matter ; we can project all of its mass density to the @xmath51-@xmath52 plane .",
    "figure  [ fig : isochrones ] shows contours of constant time delay ( isochrones ) around our example rotating mass design .",
    "the small black circles illustrate the relative size and position of the laser beams at the time of the closest approach .",
    "the large dotted circles trace out the positions of the centers of the laser beams relative to the rotating mass for a full revolution for the specific configuration discussed .",
    "the paths of the dashed circles through the isochrones map out the curves shown in figure  [ fig : timeseries ] . ]",
    "the time delay experienced by the light in the interferometer beam at any instant depends on the orientation of the rotating mass . as seen from the point of view of the rotating mass , the interferometer beam travels in a circle around the axis , as illustrated by the dashed lines in figure  [ fig : isochrones ] for beams with closest - approach distances of @xmath53 and @xmath54 , representing the two interferometer beams at ligo hanford .",
    "the time delay at the center of the beam as a function of time is shown in figure  [ fig : timeseries ] for one full rotation of the rotating mass .",
    "this is the signal which would appear in the interferometric data stream .",
    "because the form of the signal is known accurately , it may be extracted from the data using lock - in techniques .     and",
    "@xmath54 away from the outer edge of the rotating mass . ]",
    "the signal is not purely sinusoidal because the distances from the different parts of the rotating mass are comparable to the size of the rotating mass .",
    "figure  [ fig : freqdomain ] shows the fourier components of the signal ( for the nominal spin frequency of 25  hz ) superimposed on the expected sensitivity curve for advanced ligo assuming an integration time of one year . based on this comparison",
    ", the fundamental frequency component at 50  hz should be detectable with amplitude snrs of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively , in the closer and farther beams .",
    "the first harmonic ( at 100  hz ) should also be detectable in the closer beam with snr of @xmath57 . comparing these different measurements would test the consistency of the results with the expected form of the signal , while combining them in quadrature yields a total snr of @xmath58 .     and",
    "@xmath54 away from the outer edge of the rotating mass . also shown is an example advanced ligo sensitivity curve , scaled for 1 year of integration time . ]",
    "to interpret the measured signal as being due to the shapiro time delay , we must have sufficiently accurate knowledge of the geometry of the apparatus and must be able to rule out other possible systematic effects which could affect and/or fake the shapiro delay signal .",
    "however , given that we only expect an snr of @xmath278 above the instrument noise , we only need to limit these systematic effects to a few percent of the expected signal amplitude .",
    "first , we must know the separation between the rotating masses and the interferometer beam to within a few percent , _",
    "i.e. _  perhaps 1  cm .",
    "the rotating mass system parts can be machined and assembled with much tighter tolerances , and also measured precisely after assembly . when spun up",
    ", the rotating mass system would stretch by about @xmath59 due to the extreme tension on the carbon fiber composite outer layer ; this should be taken into account in the data analysis and may not be known precisely ( due to uncertainty in the bulk modulus of the carbon fiber composite ) but would be a small correction .",
    "knowledge of the interferometer beam position within its vacuum tube would be a greater challenge , but can probably be determined to 1  cm or better .",
    "the advanced ligo alignment system should keep the position of the beam stable to much better than 1  mm over the course of a year - long data run .",
    "there would also be a horizontal gradient in the time delay over the area of the interferometer beam , but the intensity - weighted mean delay ( over the gaussian beam profile ) would be well - determined and the gradient is not expected to cause any other problems . additionally , the diameter of the laser beam s vacuum tube may have to be reduced locally to allow the required close approach of the rotating mass to the laser beam",
    ".    it may be advantageous to minimize the length of beam tube devoted to the rotating mass system by placing synchronized rotating units on both sides of the beam tube .",
    "this also would reduce the time delay gradient over the area occupied by the laser beam . in the case of ligo",
    "hanford , rotating mass systems on both sides would produce equal time delays in both interferometers ( but would only partly reduce the time delay gradient across each laser beam ) .",
    "we must also consider parasitic coupling of the rotating mass system s motion to the interferometric signal through mechanisms other than the time delay .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ sec : rotatingmassdesign ] , direct gravitational coupling to the test masses would be negligible due to the length of the interferometer arms .",
    "electromagnetic interference from the motor driving the rotating masses should be negligible due to being so far away from the sensing electronics .",
    "additionally one can use a gear so that the motor runs at a different frequency .",
    "another concern is local vibration of the interferometer beam s vacuum tube , directly excited by the time - varying gravitational field of the rotating mass system .",
    "this vibration would have a significant component at twice the spin frequency and could couple into the interferometric signal by modulating light scattered off the walls of the beam tube .",
    "baffles placed at an appropriate distance can sufficiently reduce the effects of light scattering .",
    "these baffles must be mechanically isolated from vibrations coming from either the beam tube or the ground .    the residual coupling from such baffles",
    "can also be estimated using , with an additional scattering factor . @xmath60",
    "thus placing the baffles a few hundred meters away from the rotating mass should provide sufficient isolation .",
    "secondary scattering should also be analyzed , but that goes beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "such a massive rotating mass system , if even slightly unbalanced , would vibrate the ground as it rotates .",
    "we should be able to tune the balance below the sensitivity level of seismometers at initial assembly",
    ". however , residual vibration might evolve due to aging or slow differential stretching of the rotating mass s carbon fiber composite layer when it is spun up to very high speeds .",
    "if the vibration is not sufficiently attenuated as it travels through 2  km of ground , it could shake the sensing optics and introduce a spurious signal .",
    "however , the vibrational signal would be generated primarily at the spin frequency and should be detectable with seismometers near the rotating mass systems and near the interferometer test masses . thus a vibrational signal carried through the ground would largely be distinguishable from the time delay signal , which appears at twice the spin frequency and harmonics thereof .",
    "we also note that any residual false signal due to vibrational coupling is likely to appear in the data with a phase different from what is expected from the relativistic time delay signal ; this provides a useful consistency test .",
    "actual construction and operation of a rotating mass system like the one described in this paper would present several engineering challenges , but we believe that they could all be met with existing technologies . while detailed solutions are beyond the scope of this exploratory study , we can at least comment on the major issues .    in",
    "the example rotating mass system design , a total mass of @xmath1530 tonnes with a total length of 10  m must be supported reliably and spun with little friction . rather than attempting to do that with a single assembly 10  m long",
    ", we imagine that it would be divided into several independent sections , each supported by multiple bearings to be able to tolerate the failure of a bearing .",
    "the sections would be rotated by independent motors .",
    "the rotation of each section would be monitored with a rotary encoder and fed back to the drive motor to maintain the desired spin frequency and phase .",
    "the rotation and drive force would also be monitored for signs of possible drive or bearing failure .",
    "the kinetic energy of each rotating section would be of order 100200  mj , comparable to the energy in commercially available flywheel units used for energy storage  @xcite .",
    "obviously , a structural failure must be avoided at all costs ; the safety of the facility and personnel would be crucial considerations if this experiment is to be carried out .",
    "in this paper , we have explored the possibility of measuring the effects of space - time curvature over laboratory distance scales for the first time .",
    "we have found that it is technically feasible to make this measurement using the advanced ligo interferometers .",
    "however , it is far from easy .",
    "we had to resort to the use of high - tensile - strength composite materials to obtain a rotating mass system with sufficient mass and rotation speed to produce a measurable effect with an snr of @xmath278 integrated over a year of data .",
    "this is sufficient to measure @xmath10 with a precision of @xmath2725% , which could distinguish between the cases @xmath11 and @xmath61 , for instance .",
    "future interferometers could improve this type of measurement , especially if their low - frequency sensitivity is better  @xcite so that the mass can be rotated at a lower frequency . in particular , a design study is currently underway for a future underground `` einstein telescope ''  @xcite with projected sensitivity shown by the lowest curve in figure  [ fig : sensitivitycurves ] .",
    "that detector could support a shapiro time delay measurement at a spin frequency of @xmath2715  hz that would be an order of magnitude better than the advanced ligo example presented in this paper .",
    "besides the planned gravitational - wave interferometers , a dedicated interferometer could perhaps be used to make this time delay measurement .",
    "although we can not hope to approach the precision of the radar ranging measurements with this technique , it is interesting to be able to test gravity in an entirely different distance regime .",
