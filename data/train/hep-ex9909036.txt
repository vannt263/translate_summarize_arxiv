    "over the last years , the controversial results of the two experiments lsnd ( liquid scintillator neutrino detector at lansce , los alamos , usa ) and karmen ( karlsruhe rutherford medium energy neutrino experiment at isis , rutherford , uk ) both searching for neutrino oscillations  have led to intense discussions .",
    "the two experiments are similar as they use  beams from the -  decay at rest ( dar ) chain   followed by  with energies up to 52mev .",
    "furthermore , both experiments are looking for  from  oscillations via the reaction  providing a spatially correlated delayed coincidence signature of a prompt  and a subsequent neutron capture signal .",
    "however , the detection techniques are significantly different : lsnd uses a homogenous detector volume of mineral oil with a low concentration of scintillator viewed by 1220 phototubes , thereby giving excellent particle identification by detecting a directional cherenkov cone as well as isotropic scintillation light with a characteristic pattern of hit photomultipliers @xcite .",
    "karmen is a segmented liquid scintillation calorimeter with excellent time and energy resolution exploiting the distinct time structure of the isis neutrino source @xcite .",
    "thus , at karmen a  excess from  would be identified by requiring its time distribution to follow the 2.2  slope from the parent  decay .    in two data sets taken during the periods 199395 and",
    "199698 lsnd has observed a clear beam  on minus beam  off excess of events with  signature , i.e. ( , n ) sequences .",
    "these have been interpreted as evidence for   oscillations ( see @xcite for the first data set ) .",
    "the analysis of the sum of these data sets , although slightly different in their spectral shape , results in corresponding favored areas of the mixing parameter  and  @xcite .",
    "karmen has found no excess events above the expected background .",
    "for all events , potential  signal and measured background , the energy , time and spatial distributions for both the prompt and delayed events are precisely known . using",
    "this spectral information also leads to no hint for oscillations .",
    "therefore , karmen can not confirm the lsnd result .",
    "furthermore ,  exclusion limits are deduced cutting into the lsnd evidence region in the ( , ) parameter space for oscillations @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the statistical analysis of the data has become a showcase of how to determine statistical significance and upper limits .",
    "karmen with no apparent   signal and very low background has the problem of treating a result in a low statistics regime near the physical boundary @xmath0 . in lsnd",
    ", the maximum likelihood analysis of the data clearly indicates an oscillation signal .",
    "a problem arises when determining a region of correct confidence , i.e. statistical significance , in the ( , ) plane having a likelihood function in two parameters , which shows a pathological behavior , namely an oscillatory dependence in   with numerous local maxima .    in 1998",
    ", the discussion was intensified by a paper of feldman and cousins @xcite , who described a method of dealing with the problems described above .",
    "their approach to extract upper limits in the case of a small number of measured events is itself highly controversial , though recently adapted by the particle data group  @xcite .",
    "this report describes the individual evaluation of both data sets with maximum likelihood methods .",
    "the statistical interpretation of the likelihood functions and confidence regions is based on a frequentist approach and follows closely the analysis suggested by feldman and cousins .",
    "the main purpose of such an approach is to determine correct regions of confidence in ( , ) .",
    "a correct coverage is defined in terms of frequency , i.e. fraction of occurrence for future experiments .",
    "probability or confidence in this context does not mean `` degree of belief '' as defined in a bayesian statistics .",
    "for a detailed introduction into bayesian and frequentist approaches we refer to  @xcite .    although the central statements of lsnd and karmen are contradicting there can be a region in the ( , )",
    "parameter space where the results are compatible . combining the two experiments",
    "is done in different ways of constructing statistical distributions , pointing out that there is no unique way of determining regions of specific confidence . however , as we will see , the regions of compatibility in ( , ) are very similar .    the method described below is a complete analysis of the two experiments . however , the actual result is preliminary for various reasons : a new analysis of the lsnd data is under way with a new reconstruction algorithm .",
    "in addition , flux calculations and efficiencies for 1996 - 1998 used here are still preliminary .",
    "the karmen2 data used for this analysis is taken from february 1997 to february 1999 and represents about 50% of the envisaged total accumulated neutrino flux for the upgraded experiment .",
    "it is therefore an intermediate data set updated by the ongoing experiment .",
    "a statistical analysis combining two experimental results which apparently disagree is a delicate and controversial approach .",
    "it is not the task nor the purpose of this analysis to overcome this disagreement .",
    "however , assuming that there is no serious systematical error in either of the experiments and the interpretation of their results with respect to oscillations , the question of statistical compatibility of the individual results is well justified and should be addressed quantitatively .",
    "this is the objective of the analysis presented in this paper .",
    "in 1996 , the karmen experiment underwent a substantial upgrade . an additional veto counter with 300m@xmath1 surface surrounding the central detector on all sides was the main improvement .",
    "this veto counter reduces cosmic induced background for the  search by a factor of 40 , which consists of energetic neutrons produced in the iron of the blockhouse by deep inelastic scattering of cosmic muons . with the new configuration and increased neutron detection efficiency , karmen is running as karmen2 since february 1997 .",
    "starting as a simple counting experiment @xcite , the evaluation method was changed last summer to a more sophisticated maximum likelihood analysis of the data , making use of detailed event information in energy , time and spatial position .",
    "the data collected through february 1999 correspond to 4670c accumulated proton charge on the isis target .",
    "veto cuts for all veto components up to 24  before a potential oscillation event were applied and a spatial coincidence between the initial  and the neutron capture of 1.3m@xmath2 was required .",
    "figure  [ viererplot ] summarizes the remaining 8 event sequences in the appropriate energy and time windows .",
    "the background components are also given with their distributions .",
    "all components except the intrinsic  contamination are measured online in different time and energy windows ( see table  [ bgsum ] ) .",
    "[ bgsum ]    .background contributions to the  search and their determination methods . [ cols=\"<,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in total , the background expectation amounts to @xmath3 events .",
    "therefore , the 8 extracted sequences show no hint for an oscillation signal . for oscillations with full mixing and large , i.e.",
    "( @xmath4ev@xmath1 ) , a signal of @xmath5 coincidences were expected .",
    "taking the results from section  [ feldman ] for the lsnd signal in the region @xmath6ev@xmath1 , one would have expected an oscillation signal of about 2 to 6   events added to the background within the data set . in order to extract more information from the 8 events about any potentially small oscillation signal a detailed maximum likelihood analysis was performed .      this likelihood function analyses 5 event parameters : the energy @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the prompt time @xmath9 and the delayed coincidence @xmath10 as well as the spatial correlation @xmath11 .",
    "the likelihood is calculated varying the oscillation signal @xmath12 as well as the background components relative to the overall data sample : @xmath13 for charged current events , @xmath14 for cosmic background , @xmath15 for random coincidences with a @xmath16induced prompt event and @xmath17 for the intrinsic  contamination . with the condition @xmath18 and @xmath19 the likelihood function for the @xmath20 events",
    "can be written as @xmath21 the density functions @xmath22 contain the spectral information of all components , and as the positron energy spectrum depends on , the dependence of @xmath23 on  enters via the density function @xmath24 .",
    "the parameter  is determined by the ratio of oscillation events @xmath25 divided by the expected number of events for maximal mixing @xmath26 : @xmath27 .",
    "the second line in ( [ kar - lhd ] ) is the combined poisson probability @xmath28 for the background contributions @xmath29 calculated with the expectation values @xmath30 .    as mentioned before , all background components but",
    "the simulated intrinsic contamination are measured online with their spectral information @xmath22 and the expectation values @xmath30 . since the event sample is still very small ,",
    "the different backgrounds are summarized into one component with fixed relative contributions : @xmath31 , and the combined poisson probability in ( [ kar - lhd ] ) reduces to @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "hence , the likelihood function effectively has two free parameters , @xmath12 or  and .    for technical reasons ,",
    "it is more convenient to optimize the logarithmic likelihood function @xmath34 . taking the 8 events of karmen2 so far , this function has its maximum at a value of @xmath35 .",
    "this can be explained by the measured energy spectrum of the prompt events ( figure  [ viererplot]a ) .",
    "since there are all events below 36mev but @xmath36 background events expected above @xmath37mev , the best fit consists in increasing slightly the overall background contribution . since an oscillation signal for large has a higher contribution for @xmath38mev , a negative oscillation signal can then compensate the background to account for no events in that energy region .",
    "figure  [ k - lhdfunction ] shows @xmath34 where the maximum in the physically allowed range @xmath39 has been renormalized to a value of @xmath40 .",
    "note the sharp fall with increasing .    from the likelihood function it is obvious that there is no oscillation signal in the data .",
    "the task at this point is how to extract upper limits in ( , ) for a given confidence level .",
    "the method of extracting correct confidence regions in ( , ) is based on a frequentist approach and will be discussed in detail in section  [ feldman ] : the basic idea is to create a large number of event samples analogous to the experiment .",
    "these samples are created by monte carlo using the full event information for the likelihood procedure .",
    "the samples also contain oscillation events based on a hypothesis @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "a statistic is constructed by comparing each sample s maximum of @xmath34 with the value @xmath43 from which confidence regions are extracted .",
    "the data analysed in this context have been reduced by requiring the following criteria : they are so - called electron - like events surviving a @xmath44 cut , they have energies of @xmath45mev and their reconstructed distance to the tank photomultiplier surface is @xmath46 cm . in the following , all data from 1993 through 1998 are analysed in one data set , where the flux calculations , efficiencies , and background treatment of the 1996 - 1998 data are preliminary extrapolations of the older data subset .",
    "the information about a delayed event is compressed into a likelihood ratio r. if within one millisecond after the initial event another event is recorded at distance @xmath47 cm , the ratio of likelihood r in energy ( pmt hits ) , time and distance of being a correlated  over an accidental coincidence is calculated , otherwise @xmath48 .",
    "details of the event reconstruction and the definition of r can be found in @xcite and @xcite .      requiring a high likelihood ratio @xmath49 selects ( , n ) correlated events with low uncorrelated background . applying a cut of @xmath50",
    "reduces the data to 70 events with @xmath45mev . after subtracting beam unrelated ( @xmath51 ) and beam related ( @xmath52 ) background ,",
    "a net excess of @xmath53 events remains .",
    "its energy distribution is shown in figure  [ gold ] and clearly demonstrates the significance of the excess .",
    "this sample is referred to by lsnd as `` gold - plated '' events .",
    "taken the excess as oscillation signal , the signal to background ratio for this sample is better than 1 .    to determine the oscillation parameters  and , an event sample with no cut in r",
    "is used , leading to higher efficiency for the oscillation channel , but naturally increasing the background .",
    "figure  [ data ] shows this event sample comprising 3049 beam - on events .",
    "four variables are used to categorize the events : electron energy , likelihood ratio r , spatial distribution in the detector expressed in distance l to the lansce neutrino source a6 and the angle @xmath54 between the direction of the incident neutrino and the reconstructed electron path . note that these are projections of a 4-dim space of correlated parameters for each event .",
    "the evaluation method uses these 4 correlated parameters to extract the oscillation signal , i.e.  and , from other background sources by calculating the overall likelihood function @xmath23 for all 3049 events .",
    "there are 2 ways of setting up this function described below .      up to the evaluation of the 1997 data ,",
    "the likelihood function was defined as the product of the poisson probability of all bins in the 4-dimensional space made up by the parameters @xmath55 .",
    "although this definition will not be used in the further context , the analysis of the 199395 data in @xcite was based on this definition of the likelihood function .",
    "it is therefore described here for completeness and to allow a comparison to the results of the new likelihood method given in section  [ evt_subsec ] .",
    "the bin  based likelihood function was set up as @xmath56 with @xmath57 bins , @xmath58 the number of beam - on events in bin @xmath59 and @xmath60 the expected event number : @xmath61 bub indicates beam unrelated background measured in the beam off time window with high precision , brb stands for beam related background made up of various components :  ( making up 50.5% of the total brb ) ,  ( 33.6% ) , -  scattering ( 7% ) ,  ( 5.7% ) , - and - induced events on protons and  ( 1.9% ) and intrinsic   contamination ( 1.1% ) .",
    "the relative contributions are subject to change due to the 19961998 preliminary evaluation .",
    "the definition of the likelihood function was straight forward , but the treatment of the errors on the expected background components was somewhat arbitrary .",
    "the best fit resulted in an oscillation signal which , added up to the expected backgrounds , did nt explain the total beam excess , i.e. there were events in the sample which were not attributed to either bub , brb or oscillations .",
    "in a second step , the likelihood function was calculated again with a beam related background expectation enhanced ( lowered ) by one standard deviation .",
    "all three resulting @xmath34-functions were put in .or . , which means added with the same relative weight .",
    "the problem with this approach is that although the likelihood analysis clearly indicates an upward fluctuation of the brb , the case of lowering the expectation of brb is taken with the same weight as @xmath62 therefore artificially increasing the potential oscillation signal .    the favored region in ( , )",
    "was then defined by taking values greater than max@xmath63 - 2.3 and max@xmath63 - 4.6 as one would expect to determine   and  regions in a two dimensional gaussian likelihood function .",
    "given the oscillatory behavior of @xmath34 as a function of  this gives obviously only favored regions but no correct coverage in terms of confidence .",
    "to overcome the problem of background fluctuations , an alternative construction of the likelihood function based directly on the events was introduced . in the following , all results are based on this new method unless otherwise indicated explicitly .    the likelihood function is the product of all @xmath64 individual event likelihoods to fit a combination of 4-dim density distributions @xmath65 where the relative strengths @xmath66 of the contributions are the parameters to be optimized with the side condition @xmath67 . in an approximation , all beam related backgrounds are added up to one contribution .",
    "flux calculation , in the forthcoming new lsnd event reconstruction and analysis , these components will be considered individually . ] treating all beam related backgrounds as one component , the likelihood function is defined as @xmath68 there are effectively three free parameters : @xmath12 or ,   and @xmath69",
    ". the gaussian terms account for the background expectation values and their systematic and statistical uncertainties @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "if the shape analysis of the @xmath64 events ( first two lines of equation  [ evt - lhd ] ) favors values of @xmath69 or @xmath72 corresponding to brb or bub far from the expectation , the overall likelihood value is reduced by these gaussian expressions .",
    "the oscillation parameter  is determined as a function of   according to @xmath73 where @xmath74 indicates the number of oscillation events expected for a given  and full mixing @xmath75 in the detector , taking all resolution functions and cuts into account .",
    "the absolute event numbers corresponding to the maximal value of @xmath76 are 73 oscillation events , 1495 brb and 1481 bub events for a 3049 total event sample .",
    "as already indicated in the bin - based likelihood analysis , the best fit favors an upward fluctuation of the beam related background of one standard deviation .    in a next step , the original likelihood function ( [ evt - lhd ] ) is then integrated along the axis of the parameter @xmath69 which is of no further interest",
    "this is a standard procedure of reducing free parameters of a likelihood function described in @xcite .",
    "the logarithmic likelihood @xmath34 is therefore a function of the 2 free oscillation parameters @xmath77 which is shown in figure  [ l - lhdfunction ] .",
    "it reaches its maximum in the physically allowed range of @xmath78 at @xmath79 which is set to @xmath80 .",
    "however , the position of this maximum in ( , ) is not significant due to the flatness of the likelihood function along its ridge for small values of . allowing values of @xmath81 in the maximum likelihood analysis ,",
    "the maximum of @xmath34 increases by only 0.02 units along a line of constant values @xmath82 which can be understood by developing the oscillation probability for small : @xmath83 in the limit of small , the energy distribution of oscillation events does not depend any longer on .",
    "this is underlined by the best fit result of 73 oscillation events which is stable along the ridge of @xmath34 .",
    "note , however , that the maximum likelihood analysis favors the lowest value of  possible within the fit , or , in other words , the  energy spectrum with the lowest mean value possible by oscillations .      to test the dependence of the likelihood function on the expectation values of the background , the gaussian terms in ( [ evt - lhd ] ) were omitted .",
    "the result of the likelihood analysis is nearly unchanged underlining the stability of the shape analysis .    in a second test ,",
    "only events with @xmath84mev were analysed .",
    "the event sample consisted of 476 events with expectations of @xmath85 and @xmath86 for the background .",
    "the maximum of @xmath34 is then reached at @xmath87 with 46 oscillation events , @xmath88 and @xmath89 using the full likelihood function as defined in ( [ evt - lhd ] ) .",
    "this result is in good statistical agreement with the analysis of the larger event sample concerning the extracted oscillation signal .",
    "however , it is obvious that with the stringent energy cut there is a certain loss of discrimination power between low and high  solutions ( see for example figure  [ gold ] ) .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the best fit values for @xmath90ev@xmath1 . for both energy windows",
    "the favored mixing at this  is @xmath91 .",
    "the distance in logarithmic likelihood units to the maximum is different , however : @xmath92 for @xmath45mev compared to @xmath93 for @xmath84mev .",
    "applying the stringent energy cut of @xmath94mev and analysing only the spectral shape of the events ( i.e. discarding the gaussian expectation terms in equation  [ evt - lhd ] ) leads to a less consistent maximum likelihood result .",
    "again , there is almost no discrimination between different values : the values of @xmath34 along the best fit values of  as a function of  are almost constant . but the oscillation signal is significantly reduced from about 46 to some 21 events , with background contributions to the data sample of @xmath95 and @xmath96 far from their expectation values .",
    "this may indicate some unexplained distortion of the high energy part of the event spectrum but could also be due to the already mentioned naturally decreased discrimination ability of the maximum likelihood method in a very narrow energy window .",
    "another useful check is the comparison of the two likelihood functions defined in ( [ bin - lhd ] ) and ( [ evt - lhd ] ) .",
    "figure  [ bin - evt ] shows the regions in ( , ) obtained by taking the contours of both logarithmic likelihood functions at values of @xmath97 and 4.6 units below their global maximum .",
    "as explained above , the treatment of the background uncertainty in the bin based analysis favored larger  values which is not confirmed if the background can float freely as it is the case in the event based analysis .",
    "the slightly larger data set of 199398 in figure  [ bin - evt ] has almost no influence on the outcome of both methods compared to the older 199397 set .",
    "the latest lsnd publications ( e.g.  @xcite ) show these favored regions for the 199398 data set .",
    "in this section , we will first construct the correct confidence regions in the parameter space ( , ) of  oscillations for each experiment individually . in the second part ( [ combi_lnl ] ) ,",
    "the logarithmic likelihood functions of both experiments are added and discussed qualitatively . in section",
    "[ methods ] , methods of using and combining the obtained experiment statistics are defined .",
    "these will then allow the extraction of combined confidence regions .",
    "the results of these combination methods are presented and discussed in part  [ combiregio ] .",
    "the basic idea of getting correct confidence regions using the logarithmic likelihood function @xmath77 is to create a statistic based on a frequentist approach .",
    "a high number of event samples is created by monte carlo using all experimental information on the event parameters .",
    "different hypotheses are tested by including in the generated event samples oscillation events according to the oscillation parameters ( , ) . in this section",
    "we will describe this method in detail for the lsnd experiment and then show the representative results for both karmen and lsnd .",
    "the analogous statistical approach for the karmen data can be found in detail in @xcite .    for a preselected  oscillation hypothesis @xmath41 with oscillation parameters",
    "@xmath42 the creation of a lsnd - like event sample is done in two steps .",
    "first , the number of oscillation events , brb and bub are thrown on the basis of the corresponding expectation values . in a second step , for each event",
    ", parameters ( e , r , l,@xmath98 ) are generated from the density functions @xmath99 .",
    "the index @xmath100 stands for the 3 different contributions .    after an event sample",
    "is generated , the sample is analysed in exactly the same way as the experimental sample , i.e. the logarithm of the likelihood function ( [ evt - lhd ] ) is calculated as a function of ( , ) .",
    "figure  [ feld1 ] shows the distribution of the maxima @xmath101 of 1000 mc generated samples with @xmath102 .    the maxima are spread over a wide range in ( , ) indicating already the limited capability to determine a small area in ( , ) on the basis of the lsnd event sample .",
    "to construct confidence regions , the distribution shown in figure  [ feld2 ] is central and should be read in the following way : to include the oscillation hypothesis @xmath42    with a probability ( frequency of occurrence ) of 90% , the area in ( , ) has to be defined by cutting @xmath34 at a value of @xmath103 for each individual likelihood function .",
    "this statistic as a function of @xmath104 shows the spreading of the maximal value of @xmath34 compared to a given pair of oscillation parameters . if , for a given experiment , the value @xmath105 is smaller than @xmath104 obtained for a specific hypothesis , such a parameter combination @xmath42 would be included in the region of 90% confidence . for the lsnd logarithmic likelihood function ,",
    "the difference is @xmath106 as shown in figure  [ feld2 ] , in 52% of all mc samples",
    "@xmath104 is expected to be larger than 1.4 demonstrating that @xmath107 is clearly within the 90% confidence region of the lsnd experimental result .    as @xmath108 is itself a function of the parameters @xmath109",
    ", the generation of mc samples has to be repeated for all possible parameter combinations ( , ) under consideration .",
    "this task , however , is almost impossible due to the large computing time necessary to construct the statistic in @xmath104 for each point .",
    "the creation and likelihood evaluation of 1000 samples as described above takes about 500 hours cpu time on the sgi origin 200 with r10000 processor available within the lsnd computer cluster .",
    "the strategy was therefore to construct these statistics for representative pairs ( , ) and interpolate the obtained @xmath108 values .",
    "the normalized distribution in figure  [ feld2 ] is named @xmath110 and the variable @xmath111 plotting the normalized integration of @xmath112 as function of @xmath113 defined as @xmath114 allows an easy extraction of the 90% confidence value @xmath115 for which @xmath116 .    shown in figure  [ feld3 ] are some distributions @xmath117 including the one for @xmath118 for the lsnd analysis .",
    "note that these @xmath119 distributions could be quite different .",
    "there are two major conclusions to be drawn from figure  [ feld3 ] : it is obvious that the approximations of constant @xmath120 and @xmath121 under the assumption of a gaussian likelihood function with 2 independent parameters do not hold anymore under this assumption . ] . on the other hand , although there are differences in the shape of @xmath117 depending on @xmath109 the variations are not too large , even by comparing extreme hypotheses like @xmath122 or @xmath123 with 25 or 170 oscillation events in average within their mc samples , respectively .",
    "this fact is mainly due to the relative high statistics of the event samples and their individual components which ensure relatively stable results of the likelihood analysis .",
    "the situation for karmen concerning the @xmath124 distribution is different for two reasons .",
    "karmen2 has seen 8 events so far .",
    "the samples created by mc consequently also consist of this small statistic .",
    "therefore , the distributions @xmath119 and the values @xmath125 as functions of  and  have larger variations .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure  [ feld3b ] for the same starting points as for lsnd .    on the other side ,",
    "the small event sample reflecting the very low background of karmen2 allows , in reasonable computing time , to create a fine grid of starting points @xmath109 with a high number of mc samples per grid point .",
    "this leads to an accurate two dimensional distribution of the values @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "on the basis of the distributions @xmath127 the values @xmath128 for a given confidence level cl are given for the calculated @xmath109 .",
    "the next step consists of interpolating from these points to span a surface of @xmath129 for each experiment . for lsnd , there are , due to the limited cpu time and the large samples , 14 representative points with 1000 mc samples in the region of high likelihood , including the extreme of no oscillations . for karmen",
    "there are @xmath130 points over the ( , ) region of interest with 4000 mc samples created at each grid point .",
    "the corresponding confidence regions for both experiments were then obtained by cutting the logarithmic likelihood function @xmath77 at values of @xmath129 below the absolute maximum of @xmath34 .    figure  [ feld4 ] shows regions of 4 different confidence levels for both experiments individually . for lsnd , the innermost contour represents    the area of lowest confidence . for karmen",
    "the confidence level of excluded areas increases with the curves from left to right .",
    "the lack of smoothness of the lines reflects the limited number of grid points as well as the statistics of samples generated per grid point @xmath109 .",
    "this second limitation is also the reason why no  region is plotted .",
    "checking the distribution shown in figure  [ feld1 ] of 1000 mc samples demonstrates that @xmath131 for lsnd is determined by the tail of 10 mc samples and has therefore a large uncertainty .",
    "the highest confidence level deduced by these distributions which will be used in this context is therefore 95% confidence .    at , each individual experimental outcome",
    "was compared with other experiments .",
    "figure  [ feld5 ] shows the oscillation parameters inside the lsnd region and the  limits from karmen2 and other experiments .",
    "notice that the limits of the bugey  search @xcite , the ccfr combined  and  search @xcite and the preliminary results from the nomad  search @xcite are not based on this unified frequentist approach by feldman and cousins . comparing the lsnd  region with the region defined by a constant @xmath97",
    "( see figure  [ bin - evt ] for 199398 data ) , solutions with high  reappear. however , due to the relative steepness of the logarithmic likelihood function of the 199398 lsnd evaluation , the changes from @xmath97 to the correct @xmath132 do not lead to a dramatically different confidence region in ( , ) .",
    "one of the most misleading but nevertheless very frequently used interpretation of the lsnd and karmen results is to take the lsnd region left of the karmen exclusion curve as area of ( , ) left over. such an interpretation , though appealingly straight forward , completely ignores the information of both likelihood functions and reduces them to two discrete levels of individual 90% confidence . to be able to correctly combine the two experimental results and extract the combined confidence regions",
    ", we have to go some steps back to the original information of the distributions @xmath133 for karmen and @xmath134 for lsnd .",
    "this is the task for section  [ methods ] .",
    "it is a well known procedure to multiply the likelihood functions of two independent experiments in order to combine the experimental results .    instead of multiplying the likelihood functions ,",
    "an equivalent way is to add the logarithms .",
    "as already indicated in figures  [ k - lhdfunction ] and [ l - lhdfunction ] , there is some freedom in choosing the absolute scale of @xmath34 .",
    "a convenient presentation of @xmath34 is to normalize the individual functions @xmath135 and @xmath136 to a point in ( , ) where they are equally sensitive to a potential signal . in our case of the oscillation search this corresponds to values of @xmath137 .",
    "a stringent exclusion would then lead to only negative values of @xmath34 whereas a strong signal leads to a significant maximum with a positive value of @xmath34 .",
    "have no direct meaning .",
    "information can be obtained only by comparing the values within the ( , ) parameter space or with the individual experimental likelihood functions . ] hence , the combined logarithmic likelihood function can be expressed as @xmath138 figure  [ kl - lhdfunction ] shows the combined function @xmath77 with a maximum of @xmath139 on a long flat ridge of low  values .",
    "figure  [ comb_lhd ] shows slices for some values of  for the three functions @xmath140 ( leftmost or green curves ) , @xmath141 ( rightmost or blue curves ) and @xmath34 as defined    in equation  [ kl_lhd ] .",
    "the function @xmath77 allows a direct qualitative interpretation of the experiments : there is a clear maximum of the combined likelihood function with a positive value of @xmath34 favoring overall the evidence for oscillations given by lsnd . on the other hand ,",
    "compared to the individual lsnd maximum , @xmath136 , the negative karmen result reduces the maximal value by 1.6 units ( see figure  [ comb_lhd ] for @xmath142ev@xmath1 ) which corresponds to a reduction to only 20% of the original maximal likelihood .",
    "this reduction of the global maximum is a direct reflection of the general disagreement of the two experimental results . from figure  [ comb_lhd ]",
    "it is seen that for low  the position in  of the maximum is not substantially shifted .",
    "in contrast , for larger  the negative influence of the karmen result clearly shifts the maximum in  and strongly reduces the lsnd likelihood value .",
    "it also increases the difference @xmath104 to the global maximum which is an important fact in terms of the statistics @xmath143 and demonstrates that values of @xmath144ev@xmath1 have a much smaller likelihood than some combinations ( , ) in the low  region .",
    "although these observations help in assessing the combination of the two experiments , probability statements can not be deduced from the above arguments . however , an evaluation of quantitative confidence regions can be based on the distributions @xmath143 , which is shown below .      in this section",
    "we describe 4 different methods to extract areas in ( , ) of a certain confidence level cl .",
    "though they can be derived analytically we follow a more phenomenological approach .",
    "the methods are based on different ways of ordering in a two dimensional space created by the individual statistics of the two experiments , @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "the assumption that the two experiments lsnd and karmen are independent is well justified .",
    "therefore , a two dimensional distribution @xmath147 can be constructed from the one dimensional normalized distributions @xmath148 and @xmath149 by an inverse projection . a box plot of @xmath147 and its original functions @xmath112 are shown in figure  [ comfeld_t ]    for an example of a chosen parameter combination of @xmath150 .",
    "the different lines in figure  [ comfeld_t ] correspond to the limits for  of the different methods described below .",
    "this method combines lsnd and karmen by integrating the distributions for both experiments @xmath151 individually : @xmath152 this corresponds to a rectangle in @xmath153 defined by the side lengths @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "the combined confidence is then @xmath156 . to obtain a confidence level of @xmath157 we therefore have to determine @xmath158 .",
    "the lines in figure  [ comfeld_t ] labeled ( a ) show these values @xmath158 and the resulting rectangle in @xmath153 . if the experimental value @xmath159 lies within this rectangle the parameter combination @xmath160 is included in the combined  region .",
    "this method can be expressed also by taking the overlap of the @xmath161 confidence regions of both experiments to deduce the combined @xmath162 confidence region .",
    "the second method is based on the combined statistic @xmath143 with @xmath163 defined as the convolution of the individual ones @xmath164 the confidence value @xmath128 is then defined by integration of @xmath112 : @xmath165 for a given @xmath162 , the limit corresponds to a diagonal line in figure  [ comfeld_t ] , where ( b ) indicates @xmath115 for this specific ( , ) .",
    "the value @xmath166 is then compared with this @xmath115 . if @xmath167 the combination @xmath160 is accepted at a 90% confidence level .",
    "such an approach in @xmath153 corresponds to an ordering along lines of constant combined likelihood , @xmath113 below the two maxima of the likelihood functions .",
    "this method is based on an ordering principle of the elements @xmath147 , i.e. the frequency or probability of occurrence of @xmath153 .",
    "this differs to integrating starting at @xmath168 as it is done in the previously described approaches . for a given confidence level @xmath162 , combinations",
    "@xmath153 are added up in descending order starting with the highest probability of occurrence @xmath112 until a fraction of @xmath162 of the total @xmath169 is reached . in figure",
    "[ comfeld_t ] this subset @xmath170 of all @xmath153 is shown in blue . if @xmath171 , the combination ( , ) under consideration is included in the confidence region .",
    "the last method is in its ansatz not principally different to method b , but results in a confidence region dramatically different to those obtained by all other methods . instead of taking the overlap of two regions of @xmath161 confidence",
    ", the individual regions of @xmath172 confidence are added to form the combined region of @xmath162 confidence . for",
    "a  this means adding ( mathematically building the .or .",
    "of ) the regions of 68.4% individual confidence . in a graphical view",
    ", this is demonstrated by the line labelled ( d ) in figure  [ comfeld_t ] .",
    "it is instructive to discuss the differences of the methods by comparing the corresponding areas of the @xmath153 plane ( see figure  [ comfeld_t ] ) by each method .",
    "the triangle defined by ( b ) and the rectangle defined by ( a ) have almost the same area . in their corners with high values of @xmath173",
    "they allow experimental outcomes which are very unlikely , at least for one experiment .",
    "this drawback is overcome by the method ( c ) of ordering along probability of occurrence which has the disadvantage of principally disfavoring the unlikely , but very best fits of very small @xmath173 . on the other side ,",
    "the convolution method integrates along contours of constant likelihood for the combined likelihood function which is a very plausible procedure .",
    "the easiest and most straight forward method may be method ( a ) , and as we will see , leads to confidence regions very similar to those obtained by the convolution or ordering method .",
    "in section  [ combiregio ] we will show the resulting confidence regions in ( , ) for all these methods and provide further discussion and interpretation of the approaches .",
    "the combined regions of 90% and 95% confidence are shown in figure  [ comfeld_v ] as green and yellow areas in ( , ) .",
    "the figures ( a ) through ( d ) correspond to the methods ( a ) through ( d ) described in section [ methods ] . also shown for comparison are the individual experimental results : the karmen  exclusion curve ( k ) and the lsnd  region ( l ) according to the frequentist approach ( see figure  [ feld5 ] )    as well as the exclusion curves of the two experiments bugey  ( b ) and nomad  ( n ) .    comparing the results of methods ( a ) to ( c ) ( in short called overlap , convolution and ordering ) , the confidence regions have only minor differences .",
    "high  solutions are not excluded at 95% confidence , although the convolution and ordering methods clearly favor @xmath174ev@xmath1 .",
    "the confidence region for @xmath6ev@xmath1 is almost identical for all combinations . at first sight , these regions are even similar to the  region of lsnd only ( see lines indicated with l in figure  [ comfeld_v ] ) , however the combined  region extends to smaller values of  in the low  region . for large , the combined region",
    "is reduced and shifted to smaller mixing values .",
    "although there are regions at @xmath144ev@xmath1 within a  these solutions have considerably smaller likelihood than along the ridge at low , as was discussed in section  [ combi_lnl ] .",
    "this argument is underlined if regarding regions of combined confidence at an 80% confidence level . at such a level ,",
    "none of the methods ( a ) through ( c ) include solutions above @xmath175ev@xmath1 .    as mentioned before , the limited statistics of the lsnd frequentist analysis creating the distributions @xmath112 does not allow to calculate  regions with the needed accuracy .",
    "however , the only minor extension of the area by the extracted combined 95% confidence region indicates the statistical significance of the positive lsnd result .",
    "an oscillation scenario according to this combined statistical analysis is clearly compatible with both experiments .",
    "of course , this does not account for a potential systematic error or misinterpretation of the beam excess seen in lsnd .",
    "figure  [ comfeld_v](d ) shows a very distinct region of 90% confidence .",
    "it is a very controversial way of combining two experiments if their central statements are different . by selecting relative high confidence ( 70% ) regions of each experiment and building a common area by adding these regions",
    ", the underlying interpretation tends to choose one experiment over the other . as discussed in section  [ methods ] for the other methods",
    ", this approach allows combinations of @xmath153 where one value is not restricted at all , i.e. extremely unlikely points in the constructed two dimensional statistics space of @xmath147 .",
    "this method will , with better individual experimental statistics , ultimately lead to two distinct areas forming a combined  which does not help in making a decision about the statistical compatibility of two experiments .",
    "although this method results in a correct coverage , it is therefore obviously disfavored .",
    "the data sets of both the lsnd and karmen experiment were analysed with a maximum likelihood method .",
    "the definition of the lsnd likelihood function was changed from a combined likelihood of bin contents to a product of event based likelihoods allowing the backgrounds to float according to their expectation value and its uncertainty .",
    "this improvement led to slightly lower values of  for a given .",
    "for the first time , a frequentist approach based on @xcite was applied to determine confidence regions of correct coverage for the lsnd experiment .",
    "it is shown that in the case of a likelihood function depending on the oscillation parameters  and , the approach assuming a two dimensional gaussian likelihood function is only a rough approximation and does not lead to correct coverage .",
    "as both the karmen and lsnd experimental data were analysed with a likelihood function and the statistics to deduce confidence regions were built in the same manner , it is possible to combine the likelihood functions and extract combined confidence regions based on a combination of the individual statistics created by monte carlo procedures .",
    "these regions are regions of correct coverage in terms of a frequentist approach .",
    "the combined confidence regions in ( , ) extracted from different methods to combine the experiments are very similar ( if we exclude the controversial and not really convincing method ( d ) ) . though graphically not very different from what one would expect in a naive approach using the individual regions , a more detailed look shows that there are subtle differences . in figure",
    "[ feld5 ] there are no lsnd areas left to the karmen exclusion curve for @xmath144ev@xmath1 .",
    "the combined  regions in figure  [ comfeld_v](a - c ) however include some areas of larger  although the likelihood value @xmath34 is much smaller than for @xmath176ev@xmath1 therefore favoring the low  solutions . requiring a more stringent confidence level of 80% or less , only solutions with @xmath176ev@xmath1 remain .",
    "the results of this analysis remain preliminary , as stated in the introduction .",
    "this is not due to the statistical analysis itself but to the data sets used .",
    "however , the work described here is the first statistical analysis combining both the lsnd and karmen experimental outcomes and shows the feasability and results of such a method .",
    "as there are other experiments like nomad , ccfr and bugey sensitive in part to the confidence region in ( , ) , a complete analysis should also include these results on the basis of the same statistical analysis .",
    "this implies , however , the detailed knowledge of experimental data of these experiments not accessible to the author .",
    "in addition , the exclusion curve from the bugey experiment is based on the disappearance search . combining this experiment correctly with",
    "the appearance results of  or  in terms of mixing angles would therefore also require a full three or four dimensional ( with a sterile neutrino ) mixing scheme .",
    "karmen2 has no evidence for oscillations and sets the most stringent experimental limits so far on the mixing  for a range of @xmath177ev@xmath1 . however , the sensitivity of its result is not sufficient to completely cover the parameter region given by the lsnd signal .",
    "it was shown quantitatively that there are areas of confidence in ( , ) which are compatible with both experiments , especially for @xmath178ev@xmath1 .",
    "such a statistical analysis is necessary to assess the two experimental outcomes in terms of ( , ) , however , further experimental investigations are needed .",
    "the booster neutrino experiment boone  @xcite at fermilab will be built to check this controversial region of the oscillation parameters with high statistics and different systematics .",
    "another experiment is proposed at the cern proton synchrotron  @xcite .",
    "these experiments may then resolve the issue of the karmen and lsnd results on  oscillations .",
    "many people have substantially contributed to this work .",
    "first of all , i want to thank both collaborations in general for allowing the use of the full experimental data for this analysis .",
    "in particular , markus steidl provided me with the most recent data analyses of karmen2 . in numerous discussions the track for the analysis was set up .",
