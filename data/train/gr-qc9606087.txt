    "the gravitational collapse of a spherically - symmetric massless scalar - field has two possible end states . either the scalar field dissipates away leaving a flat spacetime or a black - hole forms .",
    "numerical simulations of this model problem @xcite have revealed an unexpected critical behavior when the initial conditions are close to a critical case @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is some parameter which characterizes the strength of the initial scalar field , and @xmath7 is the threshold value ) .",
    "more precisely , choptuik has found a power - law dependence of the black - hole mass on critical separation @xmath0 of the form : @xmath8 for @xmath9 , and a discrete echoing with a period , @xmath3 , ( a discrete self - similar behavior ) for @xmath5 .",
    "subsequently similar critical behavior have been observed for other collapsing fields : axisymmetric gravitational wave packets @xcite , spherically symmetric radiative fluids @xcite and complex scalar fields @xcite . in all these model problems the critical exponent @xmath2 turned out to be close to the value originally found by choptuik 0.37 , suggesting a universal behavior .",
    "however , maison @xcite has shown that for fluid collapse models with an equation of state given by @xmath10 the critical exponent strongly depends on the parameter k.    in this work we conjecture the existance of a small periodic correction , @xmath11 $ ] , to the power - law dependence of the black - hole mass .",
    "@xmath12 is periodic and its period , @xmath1 , is universal and it depends on the previous universal parameters as @xmath4 .",
    "our analytical argument predicts the existence of the fine - structure periodic term and its expected period .",
    "the argument is based upon the final stage of a super critical evolution : from the moment when the deviation from the exact self - similar critical evolution becomes larger than some given value ( and the evolution is no longer self- similar ) up to the horizon formation .",
    "we then provide a numerical evidence that verifies the existence of the conjectured periodic term , the universality of its period and the relation @xmath4 .",
    "our numerical formalism is based on the characteristic scheme of goldwirth and piran @xcite to which we have added an expansion near the origin which is essential to achieve the extremely high accuracy needed for these computations .",
    "the evolution equations , our algorithm and numerical methods , and the discretization and error analysis are all described in a previous paper @xcite , and will not be repeated here .",
    "we consider the spherical collapse of a massless scalar field .",
    "choptuik has shown that for a critical parameter @xmath7 there is a critical solution which has an infinite discrete self - similar behavior .",
    "the critical solution by itself does not yield the black - hole mass scaling relation in which we are interested .",
    "we perturb , therefore , the critical initial conditions .",
    "this leads to a dynamical instability - a growing deviation from the critical evolution toward either sub - critical dissipation or supercritical black - hole formation .",
    "let @xmath13 be a function of @xmath14 , the time coordinate of an observer at rest at the origin , that characterize the solution along the outgoing null geodesic that leaves the origin at @xmath14 .",
    "the function , @xmath15 , could be , for example , the maximal value of @xmath16 along this geodesic .",
    "following evans and coleman @xcite and maison @xcite we describe the run - away of the perturbed solution from the critical evolution , ( described by @xmath17 ) as a power - law : @xmath18 where the critical solution reaches the zero - mass singularity at @xmath19 .",
    "the prefactor @xmath20 satisfies : @xmath21 .",
    "we assume that the range of validity of the perturbation theory is restricted to some maximal deviation , @xmath22 , from the exact critical evolution , i.e. the evolution is approximately self - similar until @xmath23 . from here on the evolution is outside the scope of the perturbation theory - there is sub - critical dissipation of the field or supercritical black - hole formation . in either case , the evolution from this stage onwards looses its self - similar character .",
    "we chose now @xmath9 so that the perturbed initial conditions develop into a black - hole .",
    "the time @xmath24 required in order to reach the maximal deviation is given simply by the relation : @xmath25 of course , a larger initial perturbation requires a shorter time to reach this value .",
    "we define now the logarithmic time , @xmath26 $ ] , in which the critical solution is periodic .",
    "the logarithmic time , @xmath27 , which corresponds to the loss of self - similarity , is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 depends on @xmath22 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . the index @xmath31 denotes the family of initial conditions considered .",
    "we conjecture now that the logarithmic time until the horizon formation , equals to @xmath27 plus a periodic term @xmath32 $ ] : @xmath33   \\ . \\label{tbh}\\ ] ] the period , @xmath1 , is universal and it depends on the previous universal parameters according to : @xmath34    consider now two different initial - conditions , which lead to n and n+1 echoes respectively ( until the deviation from the critical self - similar evolution reaches @xmath22 ) .",
    "these solutions are related to each other by an exact scale transformation with a factor @xmath35 .",
    "the final stages of these two supercritical evolutions , from the stage when the deviation from the exact critical evolution reaches @xmath22 , ( and the evolution ceases to be periodic in @xmath36 ) , up to the horizon formation , are equal up to a scaling transformation .",
    "the periodic nature of the function f arises from this final stage : the period of the function f is the amount that should be added to the quantity @xmath37 , in order to reduce the number of echoes by one .",
    "this will reduce @xmath38 by @xmath3 . from eq .",
    "[ tbh ] this amount to a period @xmath39 in @xmath40",
    ".    this conjecture is verified by numerical simulations of four families of initial data ( two neutral and two charged ) . in all those families",
    "we have found that @xmath41 as a function of @xmath37 was well fit by a straight line with a slope @xmath42 . on top of this straight line",
    "there was a small modulation .",
    "the deviation from a straight line is shown in fig .",
    "1 . which provides a numerical evidence for the existence of the periodic term f in eq .",
    "we see that the function f is indeed periodic , with a universal period @xmath43 .",
    "we have to relate , now the exponent @xmath44 to the critical exponent @xmath45 ( which describes the power - law dependence of the black - hole mass ) and then generalize choptuik s scaling - relation by proving that one should also add a periodic term to choptuik s mass scaling relation . we write @xmath38 in the form : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the initial logarithmic time required for the system to settles down to a periodic behavior in @xmath36 , and @xmath48",
    "is the number of echoes .",
    "we assume that @xmath47 is independent of @xmath0 . using eq .",
    "[ tbh ] we obtain : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a family - dependent constant .",
    "we define @xmath51 as the mass after @xmath48 echoes ( note that this is not the final black hole mass ) .",
    "since @xmath52 decreases in each echo by a factor @xmath53 we have , using eq .",
    "[ ndelta ] : @xmath54 from which it follows that @xmath55 .    to obtain , @xmath56",

    "the function @xmath58 depends only on the field configuration at the moment when the deviation from the exact self - similar evolution reaches @xmath22 ( and the evolution is no longer self - similar ) .",
    "thus , @xmath58 is expected to have the same value each time the system completes another echo , i.e. each time n increases by unity .",
    "( 6 ) we find that the function @xmath57 $ ] is expected to have a period of @xmath59 .",

    "we obtain the basic power law behavior with @xmath63 .",
    "2 displays the deviation of @xmath64 from this straight line as a function of @xmath37 .",
    "the agreement between the four families shows that the fine structure is indeed universal with the expected period .",
    "one may worry , of course , whether this fine structure is real or could it arise from some numerical errors . in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we have established the stability and convergence of our code with numerous tests .",
    "still becuase of the importance of this issue we demonstrate here the physical character of this fine structure .",

    "the same features were found on all grids even though the grid sizes differ by a factor of 16 .",
    "the five curves overlap and all show the same periodic behaviour . numerical convergence",
    "( the 800 and 1600 curves are nearer than the 100 and 200 curves , for example ) is clearly seen .",
    "we have studied the spherical gravitational collapse of a massless scalar - field , both for the uncharged case and for the charged configurations .",
    "our main interest was the supercritical @xmath65 feature of choptuik s solution , i.e. the power - law dependence of the black - hole mass on the critical separation .",
    "we have shown the existence of a fine - structure above this power - law dependence in the form of a periodic term with a universal period , @xmath1 .",
    "we are not aware of such fine - structure periodic term in any other phase - transitions in statistical mechanics .",
    "our periodic term with its period strongly depends on the discrete echoing character of the critical solution .",
    "this discrete self - similarity has been seen only in the works of choptuik@xcite , abrahams and evans @xcite ( collapse of axisymmetric vacuum gravitational field ) and in our work concerning the gravitational collapse of a charged ( complex ) scalar field @xcite .",
    "abrahams and evans @xcite have found an echoing period of @xmath66 .",
    "thus , using our analytical argument , we conjecture that a careful analysis will reveal a periodic fine - structure ( to the power - law behavior ) , with a period of @xmath67 , in the model problem of the collapse of axisymmetric gravitational wave packets .",
