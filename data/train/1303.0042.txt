    "_ fermi _ e / po promotes stem careers through the use of nasa data including research experiences for students and teachers ( global telescope network ) , education through stem curriculum development projects ( big ideas in cosmology curriculum ) and through enrichment activities ( _ e.g. , _ large area telescope simulator ) .",
    "the global telescope network ( gtn ) provides students with the opportunity to engage in authentic research experiences ; similar efforts have been shown to help students develop the type of scientific inquiry skills that are needed for future stem - based careers .",
    "over 200 high school and college students have used the gtn since 2004 .",
    "the gtn now consists of 38 partners from small college , high school and amateur observatories from around the world .",
    "_ fermi _ e / po staff have developed a nasa - approved website ( http://gtn.sonoma.edu ) and regularly assist students to observe active galaxies and other targets using our robotic 14-inch telescope , gort .",
    "gort ( the _ glast _ optical robotic telescope ) is located about 45 minutes northeast of the ssu campus , in a higher , darker and less foggy location .",
    "the gtn also provides access to southern hemisphere telescopes through the university of north carolina s prompt cluster in chile .",
    "wested interviews of four female high school gtn interns noted that ",
    "students said that their interest in astronomy , science , and the scientific method had grown considerably over the summer and ( all ) expressed interest in careers in science . \"",
    "the _ fermi _ e / po program is continuing to support the gtn during fy13 - 16 in the areas of pipeline maintenance , work with minority institutions and with high school students .      in these challenging times",
    ", many universities are turning to online curricula , which are thought to improve learning as well as efficiency .",
    "along with additional funding through the nasa roses program , _ fermi _ e / po is supporting the development of an online curriculum for college students : _ the big ideas in cosmology_. the potential audience for this course is conservatively estimated at 25,000 students per year .",
    "the evaluation plan includes extensive formative pedagogical evaluation by wested , expert scientific reviewers , and a diverse group of pilot testers .",
