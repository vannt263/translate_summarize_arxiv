    "direct imaging of nearby stars can not yet detect light from extrasolar planets .",
    "however , imaging can detect circumstellar dust , and when a planet orbits inside a dust cloud , the planet can reshape the cloud dynamically , as the earth perturbs the solar dust cloud .",
    "several debris disks around nearby main sequence stars show structures and asymmetries which have been ascribed to planetary perturbations @xcite ; perhaps these perturbed disks are signposts of extrasolar planetary systems .",
    "many of these disk features can be modeled as dust trapped in mean motion resonances ( mmrs ) with a planet .",
    "@xcite suggested that as interplanetary dust spirals into the sun under the influence of poynting - robertson drag ( p - r drag ) , planets could temporarily trap the dust in mmrs , creating ring - like density enhancements in the interplanetary cloud .",
    "since then , both the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) and the diffuse infrared background explorer ( dirbe ) on the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) satellite have provided evidence for a ring of dust particles trapped by the earth @xcite .",
    "models of kuiper belt dust dynamics @xcite suggest that neptune may also trap dust in first - order mmrs .",
    "other stars may host planets like the earth or neptune .",
    "however , most of the known extrasolar planets do not resemble the earth or neptune ; they have masses in the range of 0.315 jupiter masses , and they often have significant orbital eccentricities ( see , e.g. , the review by marcy & butler 2000 ) .",
    "simulations by @xcite show that planets as massive as these on eccentric orbits placed in a cloud of inspiraling dust often create two concentrations of dust placed asymmetrically with respect to the star . maps of the vicinity of vega made with the iram plateau de bure interferometer at 1.3  mm @xcite and with the jcmt at 850  @xmath2 m @xcite reveal two concentrations of circumstellar emission whose asymmetries can be naturally explained by such a model , possibly indicating the presence of a few - jupiter mass planet in an eccentric orbit around vega @xcite .",
    "other papers have numerically explored the interactions of particular planetary system configurations with a dust disk , with a view towards developing a general key for interpreting disk structures @xcite .",
    "we assemble a primitive version of such a key by mapping the geometries of the mmrs which are likely to trap the most dust near a planet embedded in a debris disk .",
    "we illustrate the patterns formed by the libration centers of the trapped particles in an inertial frame  the frame of a distant observer .",
    "these basic patterns allow us to characterize four structures that probably span the range of high - contrast resonant structures a planet on an orbit with eccentricity up to @xmath3 and low inclination can create in a dust disk .",
    "figure  [ fig : patternfig ] shows these structures here for reference ; we discuss them throughout the paper , particularly in section 4 .",
    "cases i and ii in this figure represent the structures formed by planets on low - eccentricity orbits .",
    "cases iii and iv represent structures created by planets on moderately eccentric orbits .",
    "cases i and iii represent structures created by planets with substantially less than 0.1% of the mass of the star ; cases ii and iv represent structures created by more massive planets .",
    "first , we review some of the physics of resonant dust rings created by relatively low mass planets , like the earth and neptune . in the rest of this paper , we generalize the discussion to planets with mass up to @xmath4 jupiter masses and @xmath5 up to @xmath3 .",
    "the resonant geometries we will describe apply to the general restricted three - body problem .",
    "however , we have in mind a a source of dust , like the asteroid belt or the kuiper belt , which releases dust on low - eccentricity orbits at semimajor axes , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the semimajor axis of the particle s orbit and @xmath8 is the semimajor axis of the planet s orbit .",
    "we use the convention that quantities with a subscript 0 refer to the planet .",
    "we do not consider interactions between the dust grains , or between dust and any gas in the disk .",
    "for example , our approach does not apply to the gaseous , optically - thick disks found around young stellar objects .",
    "however , the resonances we describe must underlie the basic resonant features of the solar system dust complex and debris disks around main sequence stars with less than a few lunar masses of dust .",

    "as a particle approaches the planet from afar , it encounters stronger and stronger resonances , and has a better and better chance of becoming trapped . for particles approaching the earth or neptune , the first resonances which are strong enough to trap substantial amounts of dust are the first - order mmrs : resonances of the form 2:1 , 3:2 , 4:3 , etc . to first order in eccentricity and inclination ,",
    "these resonances consist of pairs of terms with arguments    @xmath33    where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the mean longitudes of the particle and the planet , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the longitudes of pericenter of the particle and the planet , respectively . for the earth ( @xmath38 ) and neptune ( @xmath39 ) , the @xmath40 resonance dominates at all values of @xmath36 if the dust particle has even a small orbital eccentricity , and @xmath40 librates about @xmath41 .",

    ", trapped dust populates several first - order mmrs .",
    "the condition that @xmath40 librates about @xmath41 provides a relationship between @xmath34 and @xmath36 . since rotations of the whole system by @xmath45 must not affect the dynamics",

    "figure  [ fig : loweres]b shows these three locations , marked with x s , for each of two elliptical orbits with slightly different @xmath36 s .    figure  [ fig : loweres]c shows the locus of the libration centers for the whole range of elliptical orbits shown in figure  [ fig : loweres]a . in figure  [ fig : loweres]d , the planet has moved to a new longitude , and following equation  [ eq : longitudes ] , so have the libration centers . the density wave formed by the trapped particles",
    "resembles the pattern formed by the libration centers , blurred somewhat by libration , mostly in the azimuthal direction .",
    "@xcite shows some examples of how libration blurs the patterns formed by particles trapped in individual resonances .",
    "though any individual particle in figure  [ fig : loweres ] moves steadily counterclockwise , slower than the planet , the density wave appears to rotate as a fixed pattern together with the planet . at conjunction ( @xmath50 )",
    "the resonance condition implies that @xmath51 , so the libration centers just outside the planet are always near apocenter .",
    "this condition creates the signature gap at the location of the planet seen in simulations of the earth s ring @xcite and of kuiper belt dust interacting with neptune @xcite and illustrated in figure  [ fig : patternfig ] ( case i ) .",
    "we can understand the range of possible resonant dust cloud structures by understanding the density - wave patterns created by the series of mmrs that are likely to trap dust near a planet .",

    "it also lists the corresponding leading terms in @xmath53 , evaluated for @xmath54 ( i.e. jupiter ) , and @xmath55 .",
    "the first mmrs in the list are the first - order resonances described above .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : principal ]    for a given planet / dust cloud combination , a few mmrs generally dominate the observed resonant structure . in simulations of @xmath56 dust particles approaching the earth @xcite , the first - order @xmath57410 mmrs dominate the appearance of the trapped dust cloud . in simulations of neptune s ring by @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath58 and @xmath59 resonances ( @xmath60 and @xmath49 ) dominate the appearance of the dust cloud .",
    "the factor of @xmath61 in equation  [ eq : resterm ] makes mmrs at large @xmath7 weaker and less able to trap substantial quantities of dust . but for more massive planets , the trapping probability for all mmrs is higher @xcite , so particles approaching from afar become trapped sooner , in mmrs with longer orbital periods and larger semimajor axes .",
    "likewise , close encounters with the planet more easily scatter dust grains out of exterior mmrs at small @xmath7 , and this effect worsens with the mass of the planet .    the mmrs near the planet also become close together and begin to compete with one another . if @xmath62 , the resonance overlap criterion @xcite predicts that first - order resonances with @xmath63 are completely chaotic .",
    "this condition appears to place an absolute limit on how far down the chain of resonances a dust particle can be trapped . for large particles near the earth ( @xmath64 )",
    ", this criterion predicts that the first completely overlapped mmr is 17:18 , for neptune ( @xmath65 ) , it is 8:9 , and for jupiter ( @xmath66 ) it is 4:5 .    as we have mentioned , many of the observed extrasolar planets have substantially more mass than planets in the solar system .",
    "such massive planets quickly scatter dust from their first - order mmrs .",
    "so after the first - order resonances , table  [ tab : principal ] lists the @xmath67:1 resonances , the lowest order terms available at large semimajor axes  beyond the 2:1 mmr ( nominally located at @xmath68 ) . in numerical integrations ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite found that dust spiraling inwards towards a massive planet became trapped in this series of @xmath67:1 resonances .",
    "table  [ tab : principal ] shows that the terms in these resonances which do nt depend on the eccentricity of the planet have the form @xmath69 .",
    "these terms must dominate when @xmath5 is small .",
    "the @xmath69 terms in table  [ tab : principal ] are mostly positive , so most of these arguments librate around @xmath70 .",
    "however these terms all include contributions from indirect terms , which arise from the reflex motion of the star .",
    "the indirect contributions tend to reduce the strength of the resonance , and in the case of the 3:1 , this effect makes the coefficient negative , so the @xmath71 argument librates around @xmath72 .",
    "the libration centers for the terms which librate around @xmath70 are located at @xmath73 again there are @xmath30 libration centers spaced evenly around each elliptical dust orbit , and again , the locus of libration centers appears to co - rotate with the planet . but",
    "this time , when we set @xmath74 , we find that at conjunction , the particle can be in one of a few different places ; @xmath75    one can also show following @xcite , for example , that passage through a pure @xmath69 term raises the eccentricity of a dust particle in the same way that passage through a @xmath76 term does , and that the limiting eccentricity is again given by equation  [ eq : emax ] .",
    "we can generate a rough picture of the density waves created by the dust trapped in these terms in the same manner as figure  [ fig : loweres ] , by drawing a variety of elliptical orbits with eccentricity @xmath77 at an appropriate semimajor axis , and using equation  [ eq : longitudes2 ] ( and kepler s equation ) to locate the libration centers on these orbits .",
    "figure  [ fig : efig ] shows the patterns created by the most important resonant terms listed in table  [ tab : principal ] .",
    "the first column of figure  [ fig : efig ] shows patterns for the terms which appear when the planet s eccentricity is low : the @xmath78 terms for first - order resonances , and the @xmath69 terms for @xmath67:1 resonances .",
    "the patterns are the locii of the libration centers , generated in the manner of figure  [ fig : loweres ] .",
    "the patterns in the first column of figure  [ fig : efig ] appear in the textbook by murray and dermott ( 1999 , p. 325 ) , derived in a slightly different context  by tracing the path of a particle in a frame corotating with the planet .",
    "however , the literature offers little discussion of resonant structures created by planets on eccentric orbits , and this case is crucial for understanding extrasolar planetary systems .",
    "naturally , for a planet on an eccentric orbit , there is no simple corotating frame .",
    "but we can deduce the resonance patterns associated with planets on eccentric orbits by building on the arguments used above .",
    "besides resonant perturbations , planets introduce secular perturbations to the orbits of nearby particles .",
    "when the planet s orbit is eccentric , these perturbations generally produce a correlation between @xmath43 and @xmath36 .",
    "we must consider these effects when we examine mmrs with planets on eccentric orbits .",
    "we can demonstrate the importance of secular perturbations by comparing them with radiation forces . near a planet ,",
    "the p - r time , and thereby the trapping time , is longer than the secular time scale for dust grains with @xmath79 , where @xmath80 and the laplace coefficient ( size @xmath81 unity ) is @xmath82 i.e. , @xmath83 .",
    "for example , @xmath84 for neptune , @xmath85 for a jupiter - mass planet orbiting vega at @xmath86 au .",
    "so we can expect most observable particles in the cases we are interested in ( @xmath87 ) to suffer significant secular evolution while they are trapped in a mmr .",
    "secular perturbations from planets with eccentric orbits affect all dust particles in their vicinity , even those which are not in strong mmrs .    in the laplace - lagrange description of secular perturbations , valid for @xmath88 ,",
    "a particle s osculating @xmath43 and @xmath36 are expressed as a combination of a constant forced elements , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , and time - varying free elements , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "secular evolution is easily visualized in the @xmath93 coordinate system , where @xmath94 and @xmath95 . in this system , we write @xmath96 , and @xmath97 .    when there is only a single perturbing planet on a fixed orbit , the particle s forced elements are constant , and the osculating elements , @xmath98 and @xmath31 , trace out a circle centered on @xmath99 with a radius of @xmath91 .",
    "the forced longitude of pericenter is @xmath100 , and the forced eccentricity is @xmath101 as @xmath7 approaches @xmath8 , @xmath89 approaches @xmath5 .",
    "table  [ tab : principal ] lists the approximate value of @xmath102 at the nominal @xmath52 for each mmr .    in a cloud of many particles ,",
    "many orbits with a range of @xmath103 and @xmath104 are occupied .",
    "however , all particles with a given semimajor axis will have the same @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "for example , if all particles are released on circular orbits outside the planet s orbit and outside of any mmrs , then the laplace - lagrange solution prescribes that at any given time all the particles with a given semimajor axis will occupy a circle with radius @xmath91 centered on the point @xmath99 in the @xmath93 plane . @xcite and @xcite showed that a set of orbits occupying such a circle in the ( @xmath107 ) plane form a cloud that is roughly circular , but the center of the cloud is offset from the star a distance @xmath108 along the planet s apsidal line in the direction of the center of the planet s orbit . hence",
    ", the background dust cloud in the vicinity of a large planet should often appear circular in the absence of mmrs , though if the planet s orbit is eccentric , the center of the circle will be offset from the star .",
    "when the perturber has higher eccentricity , or when a particle is in a mmr , the particle s secular trajectory changes somewhat ; the orbit no longer traces an exact circle in the @xmath93 plane , even when the librations are averaged away @xcite .",
    "however , the character of the averaged secular motion often remains the same ; @xmath98 and @xmath31 follow a simple closed loop around @xmath99 .",
    "we will retain the spirit of the laplace - lagrange approximation for the secular motion of the particles for the remainder of this paper , and we wil refer loosely to free and forced elements , even when we are discussing resonant orbits .",
    "we find that this approximation suffices for our broad exploration of planetary signatures in debris disks .      when a particle is trapped in a mmr with a planet on a circular orbit , the resonant argument which only depends on @xmath36 , not on @xmath37 dominates the particle s motion .",
    "the other terms in the resonance have coefficients @xmath109 that are zero when @xmath5 is zero .",
    "however , when a particle is trapped in a mmr with a planet on an eccentric orbit , resonant arguments which depend on @xmath37 may come into play .    to leading order ,",
    "the averaged disturbing function for a mmr with a planet on an eccentric orbit is the sum of two or more terms : @xmath110 where , as table  [ tab : principal ] shows , @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "following @xcite , we can re - express this sum as @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 the quantity @xmath116 for @xmath117 , and @xmath118 otherwise .",
    "we define @xmath119 to be always @xmath120 , so on resonance , the new argument , @xmath121 , librates around @xmath122 .",
    "equation  [ eq : phiprime ] shows explicitly that the differences among the terms only appear on a secular time scale , as @xmath123 precesses .    at any moment",
    ", the particle s orbit may be viewed as undergoing libration about @xmath124 .",
    "this change in the effective resonant argument can change the constraints on the orbital elements of resonant objects , which can result in dramatically different - looking clouds of trapped particles .",
    "often one term dominates , in the sense that @xmath125 or @xmath126 .",
    "this circumstance depends on @xmath43 , @xmath5 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , and the details of trapping , but we can appeal to numerical simulations and use what we know about the secular evolution of dust particles to help decide which terms are likely to be most important .",
    "it is easier to consider high mass planets first , because the @xmath67:1 resonances that dominate the appearance of dust clouds containing a massive planet are farther from the planet than the first - order resonances which dominate in the case of a low mass planet .",
    "particles released on circular orbits approach a planet with @xmath127 , so they reach the @xmath67:1 mmrs with @xmath43 ranging from 0 to @xmath128 . as table  [",
    "tab : principal ] shows , @xmath129 near the lowest order @xmath130 mmrs . when @xmath131 , all the terms become degenerate , in the sense that all of their libration centers occur at the same longitudes . at the other end of the range of secular motion , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 , so according to equation  [ eq : phiprime ] , the term with the largest coefficient in @xmath134 will dominate the motion of the particles .    the arguments which match the terms with the largest coefficients in @xmath134 ( see table  [ tab : principal ] ) share a second common form : @xmath135 .",
    "numerical integrations @xcite confirm that these terms to dominate the resonant dynamics over a wide range of planet eccentricities .",
    "these terms always have @xmath27 , so the corresponding arguments librate about 0 .",
    "the @xmath30 libration centers on each ellipse are located at @xmath136 we reserve a discussion of the complicated secular dynamics of these resonances for a future paper .",
    "figure  [ fig : whyblob ] illustrates the pattern formed by particles in the @xmath137 term near a planet with @xmath138 .",
    "once a particle is trapped in resonance , its secular evolution no longer obeys the laplace - lagrange solution , but the libration centers of the trapped particles will still occupy a closed curve in the @xmath93 plane .",
    "figure  [ fig : whyblob]a shows such a variety of orbits centered on @xmath139 , @xmath140 .",
    "orbits which are close to apse - alignment with the planet have higher eccentricities . like the laplace - lagrange orbit distributions discussed by @xcite and @xcite , these orbits taken together",
    "form a pattern which is roughly circular , but the center of the circle is offset from the star along the planet s apsidal line in the direction of the center of the planet s orbit .",
    "figure  [ fig : whyblob]b shows the 3 libration centers on two of these orbits , calculated from equation  [ eq : lambda3 ] . by definition , @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is the particle s mean anomaly . for particles at pericenter , @xmath143 and @xmath144 , so for particles trapped in",

    "the libration centers for this family of terms reach pericenter at two different longitudes , and these special longitudes precess at an angular frequency equal to half the keplerian angular frequency of the planet .",

    "the center of this apparent rotation lies on the planet s apsidal line between the star and the center of the planet s orbit .",
    "the resonances populated near low - mass planets cluster at semimajor axes near the planet s semimajor axis , where @xmath148 . in this vicinity",
    ", the resonant orbits can easily become planet - crossing unless they are roughly apse - aligned with the planet s orbit , i.e. @xmath149 , and @xmath132 .",
    "figure  [ fig : whybloblowmass]a shows a collection of roughly apse - aligned orbits , all with @xmath150 , and @xmath151 . in the absence of mmr s , the combination of these elliptical orbits would appear as an elliptical ring .    for the case of the 3:2 mmr , a single one of these orbits has three libration centers , shown in figure  [ fig : whybloblowmass]b . for a family of orbits that must remain roughly apse - aligned with the planet , the secular spread in the libration centers is necessarily small , and the resonant arguments are all roughly equal .",
    "so , as figure  [ fig : whybloblowmass]c shows , we should expect the density wave to resemble the pattern produced by the libration centers in any one orbit ; the libration centers associated with any mmr of the form @xmath30:@xmath31 form a set of @xmath30 clumps . as figure  [ fig : whybloblowmass]d shows , the locus of all the libration centers orbits at @xmath152 times the angular frequency of the planet ; when the planet s mean anomaly changes by @xmath153 , the mean anomalies of the clumps of particles in the 3:2 mmr change by @xmath154 .",
    "an exterior first - order mmr has two relevant terms ( equations  [ eq : firstordertermsa ] and [ eq : firstordertermsb ] ) , and for the second term , @xmath155 . for this case ,",
    "equation  [ eq : fprime ] becomes @xmath156 a key difference between the two terms is that one argument librates around 0 , the other around @xmath70 .",
    "deciding which resonances dominate in the vicinity of a low mass planet on an eccentric orbit can be tricky .",
    "when @xmath157 , @xmath158 .",
    "when @xmath159 , @xmath160 .",
    "however , when @xmath161 , the two terms tend to cancel each other , that is , @xmath162 when @xmath132 .",
    "this cancellation diminishes the strength of the resonance .",
    "so we should expect first - order resonances to be relatively weak for a dust particle whose orbit has been secularly apse - aligned with the planet s orbit . at @xmath163 , the @xmath40 resonance generally has the larger coefficient .",
    "the 2:1 mmr is an exception , because @xmath164 for the 2:1 is diminished by an indirect term , so the @xmath165 resonance easily dominates .",
    "we leave it to numerical studies @xcite to decide which mmrs and terms dominate in a given system containing a low mass - high eccentricity planet .",
    "however , no matter which mmrs dominate , we expect the same generic behavior ; the trapped dust will form an eccentric ring of dust clumps .",

    "the clumps appear to orbit a point along the planet s apsidal line , between the star and the planet , at half the mean orbital frequency of the planet .",
    "naturally , intermediate cases will result in more than one variety of resonance being populated by dust particles ; these clouds can possess features of more than one of the extreme cases shown in figure  [ fig : patternfig ] .",
    "for example , an intermediate mass planet on a low eccentricity orbit will have a slightly larger ring with a less prominent gap at the location of the planet than case i. a planet with intermediate eccentricity may have both a ring component and blobs , though librational motion may smear these blobs so that they blend into the ring .",
    "when the drag force is large and the planet s mass is small , the libration centers can shift substantially from @xmath70 . for a mmr containing a collection of resonant arguments of the form @xmath170 , the resonant perturbations are @xmath171_{res } & = & -2 j a n \\mu f'(\\alpha , e , e_0 , \\varpi , \\varpi_0 ) \\sin \\phi ' \\\\ \\left[{{de } \\over { dt}}\\right]_{res } & = & -n \\mu f'(\\alpha , e , e_0 , \\varpi , \\varpi_0 ) \\sin \\phi',\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the particle s angular frequency , @xmath67 , on resonance is nominally @xmath172",
    "pr drag causes relatively slow changes in @xmath7 and @xmath43 @xcite : @xmath171_{pr } & = & { { -gm_{\\star } } \\beta \\over { ac } } { { ( 2 + 3e^2)}\\over{(1-e^2)^{3/2}}}\\\\ \\left[{{de } \\over { dt}}\\right]_{pr } & = & { { -5gm_{\\star } } \\beta \\over { 2a^{2}c } } { { ( 2 + 3e^2)}\\over{(1-e^2)^{1/2}}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath173 is the speed of light . to locate the libration centers , we set @xmath174_{pr } + \\left[{{da } / { dt}}\\right]_{pr } = 0 $ ] , and find @xmath175 on resonance , @xmath121 librates around @xmath176 , which is greater than @xmath70 .    for the case of a planet on a circular orbit ,",
    "the observable effect on a dust cloud is a shift in the locations of the pericenters of the orbits of the trapped particles . in the absence of this effect ,",
    "the libration centers first reach pericenter an angle @xmath177 behind the planet . with this effect",
    ", the first pericenter is located closer to the planet , at an angle @xmath178 .",
    "this asymmetry concentrates the trapped dust from the earth s ring into a blob trailing the earth , sometimes called the earth s `` wake '' @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : wake ] shows an example of how cases i and iii , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : patternfig ] , could appear when the perturber s gravity is weak compared to the drag force and the shifts in the libration centers are substantial .",
    "case i shows a wake trailing the planet . for the terms illustrated in columns two and three of figure  [ fig : efig ] , the shift in the libration center appears as a displacement of the density enhancements .",
    "the @xmath67:1 resonance clumps will appear at @xmath179 , i.e. their longitudes shift by @xmath180 .",
    "the first - order resonance clumps near low - mass planets on moderately eccentric orbits ( case iii ) shift by @xmath181 in the prograde direction .",
    "this effect depends on the velocity of the dust ( @xmath182 ) , on @xmath9 , and on the mass of the planet ; it is more pronounced for small dust grains and low - mass planets close to massive and luminous stars .",
    "it is negligible for patterns generated by more massive planets ( cases ii and iv ) , even if the planets are in 3-day orbits .",
    "moreover , this effect does not appear in simulations of neptune s ring @xcite since even neptune has high mass ( and low orbital velocity ) compared to the earth .",
    "the @xmath1  eridani ring seen by the jcmt @xcite probably does not show this effect either for the same reasons .",
    "earth is the only planet in the solar system whose resonant ring has been detected @xcite .",
    "this wake in this ring produces an asymmetry in the thermal infrared background between the direction leading the earth and the direction trailing the earth , which iras and cobe dirbe detected @xcite .",
    "indeed , the earth s ring is the only observed resonant dust cloud structure  in the solar system or elsewhere  identified with an independently observed planet ! however , models of kuiper belt dust interacting with the outer planets suggest that neptune also creates a type i ring with a characteristic hole at the location of the planet .",
    "images of nearby stars with debris disks supply further examples of rings which point to undetected planets .",
    "dust clouds around vega , @xmath9 pictoris , @xmath1 eridani and fomalhaut have all been imaged at submillimeter wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9 pictoris disk is edge - on , making its resonant rings hard to distinguish  if it has any .",
    "however , the other systems appear to contain resonant rings which may be easier to classify .    *",
    "vega : * the vega debris disk may provide an example of case iv .",
    "submillimeter images of vega @xcite show two concentrations of emission that resemble those in figure  [ fig : patternfig ] ; they are not co - linear with the star , and one is closer to the star than the other .",
    "@xcite used this model to estimate that the perturbing planet has mass @xmath66 and eccentricity @xmath183 , and used the locations of the two knots of emission to infer the planet s current loation .    * @xmath1 eridani : * case iii may be a good model for the @xmath1 eridani dust ring , which has roughly four major concentrations of emission irregularly placed around the ring , and an apparent gap in the ring . as figure  [ fig : patternfig ] shows , the low - mass , moderate eccentricity planet model naturally explains the presence of a few dust clumps of various concentrations .",
    "@xcite have developed a numerical model of type iii for the @xmath1 eridani dust ring using the numerical technique developed by @xcite .",
    "they find that dust released just outside a planet with eccentricity 0.3 and mass @xmath184 becomes trapped in the 5:3 and the 3:2 mmrs with the planet , and forms a blobby eccentric ring like the one in figure  [ fig : patternfig ] . the second order 5:3 mmr may be relatively strong because the first order resonances suffer from the cancellation described in section  [ sec : lowmassplanets ] .",
    "though dust trapped in these resonances probably forms relatively narrow rings , the large beam of the jcmt could easily blur such a narrow blobby ring into something resembling the @xcite image , as @xcite illustrate .",
    "* fomalhaut : * the a3 v star fomalhaut has a circumstellar dust cloud , recently identified as ring with an azimuthal asymmetry representing @xmath185% of the total flux from the disk @xcite .",
    "this ring is difficult to classify , since it is roughly @xmath186 from edge - on .",
    "@xcite suggest that the dust may trapped in a 2:1 mmr with a planet , and @xcite suggest that the dust might be trapped in a 1:1 mmr with a planet .",
    "however , the 1:1 mmrs are much harder to populate with dust than the mmrs we consider here , and contrary to @xcite , we consider it improbable that a single mmr , even the 2:1 , could dominate the appearance of a real dust cloud , particularly one as collisional as fomalhaut s .",
    "more likely , the structure in the fomalhaut ring arises from collisions @xcite or if resonant trapping is responsible for the azimuthal structure , there is another clump to be found , perhaps obscured by the limb - brightening .    we know",
    "no observed examples of case ii rings .",
    "however , the close - in extrasolar planets with periods less than @xmath187 days have nearly circular orbits , probably due to tidal effects @xcite .",
    "any dust disks associated with these planets could form examples of case ii .",
    "we have only addressed the geometry of resonant dust orbits .",
    "a variety of other phenomena may affect the appearance of an actual debris disk .",
    "for example , we have not discussed how the resonances are populated .",
    "different resonances may dominate when a disk is fed by a belt of asteroids or comets whose orbits are restricted to a small region of phase space .",
    "furthermore , many known dust disks are collisional . for systems like the rings of saturn , where each particle has a collision roughly once per orbit , the collisions dominate the resonant effects we catalog here , and",
    "a fluid description of the particles becomes more appropriate .",
    "collisions which occur on intermediate time scales , however , may leave particles trammelled in the net of the underlying strong resonances , altering only the spectrum of populated mmrs .",
    "for example , mutual collisions among dust grains may destroy dust particles before they can access all the strong resonances ; this effect would preserve the basic four structures shown in figure  [ fig : patternfig ] .",
    "we have also neglected the terms in mmrs that depend on the inclinations , and restricted our analysis to planets with moderate eccentricity . at high planet inclinations ( @xmath188 ) and eccentricities ( @xmath189 ) , many new terms in the disturbing function",
    "become relevant .",
    "these effects can alter the basic resonant geometries .",
    "many planetary systems have more than one planet ; we have also only considered the effects of one planet .",
    "since we are only interested in high - contrast structures , we may justify this approach by saying we only care about the first massive planet to encounter the inspiraling dust  massive enough to create a high - contrast structure by ejecting most of the dust grains as they pass .",
    "for example , in simulations by @xcite , neptune ejects most of the inspiraling kuiper belt particles before they can encounter any other planets ; we are interested in analogous planets .",
    "however , the secular evolution of a multiple - planet system may affect how a planet interacts with a dust cloud , even if little dust reaches most of the planets , and they do not carve their own signatures .    finally , we have tacitly assumed that the dust cloud is observed face on .",
    "disks which are tilted from face - on may show a variety of asymmetries due to effects other than resonant trapping , such as the iras / dirbe dust bands @xcite , secular warps @xcite , and limb brightening .",
    "four basic structures probably represent the range of high - contrast resonant structures a planet with eccentricity @xmath190 can create in disk of dust released on low - eccentricity orbits : a ring with a gap at the location of the planet , a smooth ring , a blobby eccentric ring , and an offset ring plus a pair of clumps .",
    "some of these structures have slowly become revealed in numerical simulations of particular debris disks ; we have chased them to their dens in the resonant landscape of the 3-body problem .",
    "the crude key we have assembled should help classify the debris disk structures seen by upcoming telescopes like sirtf , sofia , alma , jwst and darwin / tpf .",
    "observing one of these structures instantaneously should allow us to categorize the planet as high or low mass ( compared to jupiter orbiting the sun ) , and low or moderate eccentricity ( compared to @xmath191 ) . in the case of a ring with a gap or an offset ring plus a pair of clumps ,",
    "the image of the face - on cloud directly indicates the current location of the planet and points to its longitude of perihelion . in the case of a blobby eccentric ring",
    ", numerical modeling can potentially reveal these parameters .",
    "we thank tommy grav , sean moran and mike lecar for helpful discussions .",
    "this work was performed in part under contract with the jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) through the michelson fellowship program funded by nasa as an element of the planet finder program .",
