    "we also fit the data at each swelling amplitude to a stretched - exponential . for small and intermediate @xmath11 , these fits describe the data very well . for @xmath140 and @xmath141 ,",

    "we find that @xmath1 varies over a wide range in the neutral model , approaching @xmath6 for small @xmath11 and continuously dropping down to @xmath5 for @xmath139 .",
    "in contrast , @xmath1 is not a strong function of @xmath11 in the purely repulsive model .",
    "thus , we see that the crucial difference between the relaxation in the two models stems from the form of the relaxation within an individual cluster  in the neutral case , @xmath31 possesses a power - law decay , whereas in the purely - repulsive model , @xmath31 is approximately constant . in supercooled liquids ,",

    "our neutral - interaction particle model exhibits this nontrivial behavior simply by increasing the swelling size , @xmath11 .",
    "the extreme stretching is associated with larger clusters of interacting particles that must relax .",
    "our results provide a concrete example of an extremely simple set of dynamics that produce a wide range of stretching exponents . we have shown that randomness in the initial particle positions is sufficient to produce stretched - exponential relaxation , even when the collision rule is completely deterministic . allowing the collisions to be repulsive or attractive with equal probability , a wide range of stretching exponents",

    "[ strexp ] may be viewed as a convenient two - parameter fitting function  @xcite .    in both model variants , density fluctuations in the initial state lead to a broad distribution of cluster sizes , which was a key ingredient in understanding the dynamics of the two models . however , the value of the power - law exponent @xmath123 describing the lifetime of a cluster of size @xmath30 ( eqn .",
    "[ taun ] ) was not particularly important for obtaining long tails in the relaxation ; apparently @xmath123 does not have to be fine - tuned to yield approximately stretched - exponential behavior .",
    "more broadly , we have found that this simple model that was introduced for a non - brownian suspension looks to be a good model for glassy dynamics .",
    "several signatures of glassy behaviors have recently been reported in a two - dimensional version of the model  @xcite .",
    "here we have shown that both two - dimensional and one - dimensional versions of the model exhibit glassy relaxations .",
    "we expect this is because the model captures fluctuations in density , which would clearly be there in a glass .",
    "particles interact because of randomness , and they must get out of each other s way to relax . this disorder is what gives rise to the slow relaxation .",
    "this remarkably simple set of rules is just sufficient to generate this nontrivial behavior , and is therefore promising as an avenue for studying glassy systems .",
