    "lattice models have been extensively used in the physical sciences over the past decades to describe a wide variety of condensed matter equilibrium and non equilibrium phenomena see e.g. , the reviews in @xcite .",
    "magnetization was the original application , but the list has grown to include structural transitions in dna @xcite , polymer coiling @xcite , cellular automata @xcite , and gene regulation @xcite to name a few .",
    "the resulting models are certainly simplified , but what they lack in detail is compensated by their amenability to analytical and computational treatment  and , occasionally , to exact solution . moreover , at least for the behavior in the vicinity of a continuous transition , the simplifications inherent in these approximate models may be presumed to be inconsequential . in short ,",
    "lattice models have proved extremely useful in the context of the physical , biological and even chemical sciences . in more recent years , lattice models have also been applied to study social phenomena @xcite , such as racial segregation @xcite , voter preferences @xcite , opinion formation in financial markets @xcite , and language changes in society @xcite , offering insight into socioeconomic dynamics and equilibria . in this paper",
    "we consider the problem of gang aggregation via graffiti in what is  to the best of our knowledge  the first application of lattice model results to the emergence of gang territoriality .",
    "scratching words or painting images on visible surfaces is certainly not a new phenomenon .",
    "wall scribblings have survived from ancient times and have been used to reconstruct historical events and to understand societal attitudes and values . today , graffiti ( from the italian _ graffiare _ , to scratch ) is a pervasive characteristic of all metropolitan areas @xcite .",
    "several types of graffiti exist .",
    "some are political in nature , expressing activist views against the current establishment ; others are expressive or offensive manifestations on love , sex or race . at times , the graffiti is a mark of one s passage through a certain area , with prestige being attributed to the most prolific or creative tagger or to one who is able to reach inaccessible locations . the mark can be anything from a simple signature to a more elaborate decorative aerosol painting @xcite .",
    "all of these types of graffiti are usually scattered around the urban landscape and do not appear to follow any predetermined spatio  temporal pattern of evolution .",
    "they affect the quality of life simply as random defacement of property , although sometimes they are considered art @xcite .    on the other hand , _ gang _ graffiti represents a much more serious threat to the public , since it is usually a sign of the presence of criminal gangs engaged in illegal or underground activities such as drug trafficking or extortion @xcite .",
    "street gangs are extremely territorial , and aim to preserve economic interests and spheres of influence within the neighborhoods they control .",
    "a gang s `` turf '' is usually marked in a characteristic style , recognizable to members and antagonists @xcite with incursions by enemies often resulting in violent acts .",
    "the established boundaries between different gang factions are sometimes respected peacefully , but more often become contested locations where it is not uncommon for murders and assaults to occur @xcite .",
    "it is here , on the boundaries between gang turfs , that the most intense graffiti activity is usually concentrated .",
    "several criminological and geographical studies have been presented connecting gang graffiti and territoriality in american cities @xcite . in particular , it is now considered well - established that the spatial extent of a gang s area of influence is strongly correlated to the spatial extent of that particular gang s graffiti style or language .",
    "furthermore , it is known that the incidence of gang graffiti may change in time , reflecting specific occurrences or neighborhood changes .",
    "for example , rival gangs may alternate between periods of truce and hostility , the latter being triggered by arrests or shootings .",
    "similarly , boundaries may shift locations when the racial or socio  economic makeup of a neighborhood changes , creating new tensions , or when gang members migrate to new communities @xcite . in all these cases ,",
    "periods of more intense gang hostility are usually accompanied by intense graffiti marking and erasing by rival factions in contested or newly settled boundary zones @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a mathematical model that includes relevant sociological and geographical information relating gang graffiti to gang activity . in particular , we study the segregation of individuals into well defined gang clusters as driven by gang graffiti , and the creation of boundaries between rival gangs .",
    "we use a spin system akin to a 2d lattice ising model to formulate our problem through the language of statistical mechanics . in this context , the site variables @xmath0 have two constituents which represent ` gang ' and ` graffiti ' types , respectively , and _ phase separation _ is assumed to be the proxy for gang clustering . for the purpose of simplicity , we consider only two gangs , hereafter referred to as the red and blue gang , whose members we refer to as _ agents_. lattice sites may be occupied by agents of either color or be void .",
    "since gang members are assumed to tag their territory with graffiti of their same color , we also assign a graffiti index to each site representing the preponderance of red or blue markings .",
    "in particular , agents are attracted to sites with graffiti of their same color , and avoid locations marked by their opponents .",
    "we deliberately avoid including direct interactions between gang members , so that  ferromagnetic \" type gang  gang attractions exist only insofar as they are mediated by the graffiti .",
    "on one hand this is mathematically interesting : in the broader context of physical systems , interactions are often mediated but rarely are indirect interactions the subject of mathematical analysis . on the other hand , by excluding direct gang interactions , we can specifically focus on the role of graffiti in gang dynamics and segregation . furthermore , as will be later discussed , under certain conditions , gang  gang couplings may be unimportant , and",
    "one of the primary conclusions of this work is that they appear to be unnecessary to account for the observed phenomena of gang segregation . in any case",
    ", we informally state without proof that all the results of this work also hold if explicit agent  agent interactions are included .",
    "we thus write @xmath1 , representing the agents and graffiti configuration at site @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the former component @xmath3 is discrete allowing , for simplicity , at most one agent on each site .",
    "the latter @xmath4 is continuous and , in principle , unbounded .",
    "we let @xmath5 denote a spin configuration on the entire lattice , and in section [ s : hamiltonian ] , propose a hamiltonian , @xmath6 , to embody all relevant sociological information . once @xmath7 has been determined , the probability for the occurrence of a spin configuration @xmath5 on a finite connected lattice @xmath8 is determined by the corresponding gibbs distribution @xmath9 .",
    "note that due to the choices made on the range of the @xmath10 values , @xmath9 is discrete in the @xmath11 variables and continuous in the @xmath12 ones .",
    "it is given by    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the partition function for the finite lattice @xmath15 formally provided by the expression    @xmath16    here , @xmath17 denotes the set of all possible configurations on @xmath15 and the summation symbol is understood to be a summation over the discrete components and an integration over the continuous ones .",
    "as usual , we begin with a finite lattice and its associated boundary conditions , and obtain infinite volume results by taking the appropriate limits . using techniques from statistical mechanics , we prove that our system undergoes a phase transition as the coupling parameters are varied . in the unconstrained ensemble ,",
    "certain parameter choices lead to predominance of either the red or blue gang , indicating that for configurations where the red to blue gang ratio is fixed at unity , a phase separation will occur .",
    "conversely , in other regions of parameter space , there is no dominance of either gang type , indicating that the two are well - mixed and/or dilute . in this work",
    "we will investigate under which conditions to expect phase separation or gang dilution .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section [ s : hamiltonian ] , we give details of the model and in section [ s : nearestneighphasetransition ] , we prove that a phase transition exists as a function of the relevant parameters . since information on the location of _ all _ transition points is , by necessity , incomplete we consider an approximation in the form of a simplified mean field version of our hamiltonian and derive the corresponding mean field equations in section [ s : mfhamiltonian ] . here , we show that the mean field hamiltonian also exhibits a phase transition and we further prove that the latter is continuous in one specified region of parameter space and first order in another",
    ". finally , in section [ s : discussion ] we end with a discussion of potential sociological and ecological implications of our results .",
    "let us define a spin system on a finite lattice @xmath18 . here",
    ", the spin at each site @xmath19 is denoted by @xmath1 and , we reiterate , @xmath3 denotes the _ agent spin _ and @xmath4 represents the _ graffiti field_. we allow the agent spin to be in the set @xmath20 ; @xmath21 if the agent at site @xmath2 belongs to the blue gang , @xmath22 if there is no agent , and @xmath23 if the agent is a red gang member .",
    "the graffiti field is in the set of real numbers : @xmath24 indicates an excess of red graffiti , @xmath25 an excess of blue graffiti , and , in either case , @xmath26 indicates the magnitude of the excess .",
    "we now introduce the formal hamiltonian @xmath6    @xmath27    where @xmath5 is a given configuration on the full @xmath15 lattice , @xmath2 and @xmath28 index its sites and @xmath29 is the sum taken over every bond between nearest neighbor sites belonging to @xmath15 . we discuss the role of spins on the lattice boundary @xmath30 in proposition [ 3point4 ] and following sections .",
    "the expression in [ e : hamiltonian ] will be referred to as the gi  hamiltonian ( graffiti interaction hamiltonian ) and its corresponding partition function will be denoted by an unadorned @xmath31 .",
    "note that since @xmath3 is either @xmath32 or @xmath33 , @xmath34 ; however , we choose to display the above form to leave open the possibility of @xmath35 . as discussed earlier",
    ", there are no _ explicit _ agent  agent interactions in this model ; indeed , the structure of the hamiltonian assumes that gang members interact with each other only via the graffiti tagging . as a result ,",
    "occupation at site @xmath2 by a gang member is `` energetically '' favored only if nearest - neighbor and on - site graffiti are predominantly of its same color .",
    "the two coupling constants , @xmath36 for nearest - neighbor interactions and @xmath37 for on - site occupation , reflect this trend .",
    "the @xmath38 term represents the proclivity of a given site to be occupied by agents regardless of color , implying that gang members carry a strong tendency to occupy unclaimed turf if @xmath39 , while @xmath40 represents a natural paucity of gangs altogether .",
    "finally , we assume graffiti imbalance of either color to be energetically unfavorable via the @xmath41 term .",
    "this can be interpreted as natural decay of graffiti due to the elements , or to police or community intervention . for purposes of stability",
    ", @xmath42 must be positive .",
    "although the interactions @xmath36 , @xmath37 are tacitly assumed to be positive , generalizations to negative values may be possible , and a corresponding analysis may be undertaken given the proper sociological interpretations .",
    "the basic strategy we follow to demonstrate an ordered ,  low temperature \" phase is a _ contour _ argument , here illustrated : suppose that @xmath3 , the agent spin at site @xmath2 , differs from the agent spin @xmath43 at a different site @xmath28 .",
    "the two agent spins can differ either by color , representing two different gang affiliations , or by occupation , where one site is occupied and the other is void . at the scale of nearest neighbors , each edge in the lattice",
    "can be defined as either a _ coherent _ bond , where the adjoining lattice sites are occupied and their agent spins are identical , or as an _",
    "incoherent _ bond if this condition does not hold .",
    "thus , explicitly , @xmath44 or @xmath45 are coherent , and all the other types are not .",
    "let us now consider any path on the lattice that joins sites @xmath2 and @xmath28 .",
    "since @xmath2 and @xmath28 have agent spins which are not identical , it must be the case that on any path between @xmath2 and @xmath28 , there is an incoherent bond .",
    "furthermore , these incoherent bonds must form a closed contour on the dual lattice that separates @xmath2 from @xmath28 . in the following subsections ,",
    "we derive a bound on the probability of any such incoherent bonds and their aggregation into contours .",
    "when these probabilities are small enough  which happens in certain regions of the parameter space  we can establish a low temperature phase .",
    "for example , the presence of a red agent at the origin will imply that , with significant probability , the majority of the other sites will also be occupied by red agents , showing the existence of a red phase .",
    "similarly , a blue phase can be shown to exist .    to achieve all of these ends",
    ", we will employ the methods of _ reflection positivity _ described in @xcite and @xcite which contain a detailed account of useful techniques along with relevant classic references . in this paper",
    ", we will be working on the @xmath46 _ diagonal _ 2d torus  the sst  which we denote by @xmath47 .",
    "we will often refer to the gibbsian probability measure on @xmath47 associated with the hamiltonian in eq.([e : hamiltonian ] ) which we denote by @xmath48 .      by means of the reflection positivity of the gibbs distribution we can easily bound the expectation of an observable which depends only on the spin at any two neighboring lattice points .",
    "this result will be used to build the contour argument that will lead us to prove the existence of a low temperature phase .",
    "we thus briefly introduce the concept of reflection positivity , referring the interested reader to @xcite for a more detailed discussion of these topics .",
    "consider a plane of reflection @xmath49 which intersects the torus in a path running through next nearest ( diagonal ) pairs of sites .",

    ", @xmath56 , which , in a natural fashion identifies sites in @xmath51 with those in @xmath52 via a reflection through @xmath49 , can also be used to define maps between @xmath54 and @xmath55 : specifically , if @xmath57 , we define @xmath58 to be the function @xmath59 evaluated on the configuration reflected from @xmath52 .    a measure",

    "@xmath63 .",
    "it is known ( e.g. , see @xcite ) that @xmath64 is reflection positive with respect to @xmath50 for every @xmath49 of the above described type .",
    "we next use reflection positivity to find an upper bound on the expectation of observables defined on bonds . in doing so",
    ", we use the following lemmas :    [ l : tilingbound ] let @xmath65 denote a bond of @xmath47 and let @xmath66 and @xmath67 denote site events at the respective endpoints of the bond .",

    "we consider an arbitrary graph and , as will be made evident , the proof automatically accounts for any fixed boundary conditions .",
    "now , as is well known , it is sufficient to establish that the lattice condition eq.([czw ] ) holds when differences between configurations are exhibited only on a pair of spin  variables .",
    "the fixed boundary spins thus may be regarded as part of the background which is common to all four possible agent  graffiti spin configurations in question .",
    "let us thus assume that the differences between two configurations occur at sites @xmath131 and @xmath83 in the graph where certain specified variables have been `` raised '' above a base configuration level @xmath5 .",

    "it is not hard to show , by monotonicity , that a limiting _ red measure _ exists along any thermodynamic sequence of volumes and that the limit is independent of the sequence and therefore translation invariant .",
    "we shall denote this measure by @xmath170 and by @xmath171 the corresponding expectations .",

    "similar considerations apply to the corresponding @xmath189 .",
    "it is immediately clear  by symmetry or stochastic dominance  that @xmath190 and thus the single site distributions are identical . by the corollary to the strassen theorem @xcite since @xmath191 _ and _ these measures have identical single site distributions they must be identical probability measures .",
    "similar considerations apply to the full measures since the distribution of the @xmath165 is determined by their conditional distributions given the local configuration of the @xmath3 s .",

    "we claim that the final ratio is bounded by @xmath233 multiplied by a constant that may be proportional to the ratio @xmath234 .",
    "indeed let us substitute @xmath235 and @xmath236 .",
    "the above quantity can thus be rewritten as    @xmath237    our claim is obvious if @xmath238 but we may wish to consider cases where @xmath239 stays bounded away from zero . in general , the integrands are not dominated by large @xmath207 and we may expand the factors @xmath240 with the result @xmath241 we finally claim is that the right side is bounded by a linear function of @xmath239 : @xmath242 for some @xmath243 .",

    "the next proposition concerns the relative abundance of , e.g. , red sites under the condition @xmath270 with the other parameters fixed .",

    "hence , in finite volume , we may bound    @xmath298    where @xmath299 is the event of a red @xmath271connection between the origin and the boundary .    when the red agent occupation probabilities are dominated by independent sites with parameter @xmath296 , such probabilities decay exponentially .",
    "evidently , in the limiting state , the `` magnetization '' vanishes which by proposition [ reh ] implies a unique state .",
    "similarly , exponential decay of correlations is implied by exponential decay of @xmath271connectivities .",
    "in the previous section , we showed that a phase transition between well  mixed and clustering configurations exists for the general hamiltonian in eq .. however , finding the exact or even approximate values of the @xmath300 parameters for which the well  mixed to clustering transition occurs is in general a difficult task .",
    "moreover , the nature of the transition is not elucidated by the techniques of the preceding section . on the basis of informal simulations described in the appendix and certain other considerations it appears that the transition may be discontinuous or second order depending on where the phase boundary is crossed .",
    "this can not be proved in the context of the present model .",
    "we thus introduce a _",
    "mean  field hamiltonian _",
    ", where instead of nearest  neighbor interactions we consider an all  to  all ( interaction ) coupling that is rescaled by the number of sites",
    ". models of this sort are often referred to as _",
    "complete  graph _ systems .",
    "the mean  field hamiltonian allows us to define , in the thermodynamic limit , a simple mean field free energy per particle .",
    "this free energy can be subjected to exact mathematical analysis which provides a quantification of the phase transition . in particular , we have found that the phase boundary between the diffuse states and the gang  symmetry broken phase can indeed be of either type .",
    "let us thus consider a lattice of @xmath301 sites  where the detailed geometry is no longer of relevance .",
    "at each site @xmath2 , there is the same @xmath1 featured in the previous section .",
    "however now , the hamiltonian reads @xmath302 it is observed that the couplings @xmath36 and @xmath37 need no longer be distinguished . indeed , for large @xmath301 , the @xmath303 interaction , and any other _",
    "interaction is not of pertinence .",
    "we now introduce the relevant collective quantities , @xmath304 @xmath305 , and @xmath83 , obtained via @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which will allow for a more convenient analysis .",
    "in particular , if @xmath306 and @xmath307 designate the number of red and blue lattice agents , respectively , we define @xmath308 as the fraction of the lattice covered by agents of any type and the excess  positive or negative  of this fraction that is of the red type .",
    "moreover , we introduce @xmath309 to be the average graffiti imbalance . in this context , @xmath304 and @xmath305 are akin to magnetizations in a standard one  component spin model , with @xmath304 corresponding to magnetization in the agent variables and @xmath305 in the graffiti field . for occasional use",
    ", we also define @xmath310 .",
    "we remark that in these definitions there is an implicit @xmath301 dependence which is notationally suppressed .      in the forthcoming",
    ", we will evaluate , asymptotically , the mean field partition function @xmath311 defined in accord with the previous section as the partition sum @xmath312 here , for reasons which will soon become clear , we will treat the graffiti field variables slightly differently .",
    "we define @xmath313 as the normalized gaussian measure for the individual field variables . letting @xmath314 denote the array of these random variables we may write @xmath315 where @xmath316 denotes expectation with respect to the free ( independent ) ensemble of gaussian random variables and @xmath317 denotes the rest of the partition sum i.e. , over the agent configurations .",
    "it is acknowledged that this differs from the prior definitions by a multiplicative factor of @xmath318^{n/2}$ ] which , of course , is inconsequential .",
    "it is at this point , with the current formulation , that the advantage of the all  to  all coupling is manifest : for any @xmath5 ( and any @xmath301 ) the quantity in the exponent depends only on @xmath304 , @xmath83 and @xmath305 : @xmath319 . concerning the agent configurations , to perform the summation",
    ", we must multiply the integrand by the number of ways of arranging @xmath320 red sites and @xmath321 blue sites among @xmath301 possible positions .",
    "we denote this object by @xmath322 which is given , explicitly , by the trinomial factor @xmath323 as for the graffiti field configurations , it is noted that since @xmath305 is proportional to a sum of gaussian random variables , it is itself a gaussian .",
    "indeed the mean of @xmath324 is zero and the variance is @xmath325^{-1}$ ] .",

    "thus the efforts of a mean  field analysis may be summarized as follows : we are to minimize @xmath333 and the values of @xmath83 , @xmath304 and @xmath305 at the minima  as a function of the couplings  will determine the various _ phases _ of the system .",
    "even in this simplified context , as will be seen , the phase transitions can be dramatic .",
    "the free energy function is obviously well behaved except at the extreme values of the variables . in particular",
    ", we would like to assume that @xmath334 and @xmath335 where the strict inequalities imply that the function is smooth . now a direct calculation of the asymptotics makes it clear that no minimum could possibly occur near the @xmath336 and @xmath337 boundaries .",
    "thus , we can confine attention to the interior of the above @xmath83 and @xmath304 intervals and proceed by differentiation of @xmath333 as defined in eq.([oiq ] ) .",
    "thus we arrive at the _ mean  field equations _ : @xmath338 free energy minimization only occurs for values of @xmath339 that satisfy the above system . however , other stationary points for @xmath329 can  and , e.g. , in the case of discontinuous transitions generically will  occur so we must proceed with some caution .",
    "it is noted that eq.([vsr ] ) allows us to eliminate @xmath305 altogether . defining @xmath340 , we rewrite eqs . and as @xmath341 the analysis of this system , along with the minimization it is supposed to imply will constitute the bulk of the remainder of this work .",
    "foremost , it is noted that the presentation in eqs.([e : mf_b2 ] ) and ( [ e : mf_n2 ] ) are , for all intents and purposes , the same as would have been obtained from the mean  field version of the so  called beg model @xcite . as such",
    ", some aspects of the current problem have been treated in @xcite .",
    "however , the specifics in @xcite are not readily translated into that of the current work and , moreover , our conclusions are achieved by straightforward methods of analysis .",
    "our investigation will proceed as follows : it is evident from physical considerations , and the subject of an elementary mathematical theorem proved at the end of this subsection , that as the parameters sweep through their allowed values , a phase transition occurs from the circumstances where @xmath329 is minimized by @xmath342 to those where @xmath343 is required .",
    "first , we will follow the consequences of the _ assumption _ that this happens continuously : i.e. , that the minimizing @xmath304 goes to zero continuously through small values . in the leading order ,",
    "this provides a purported phase boundary which we denote by the lsp  curve .",
    "considerations of higher order terms in the vicinity of the lsp ",
    "curve yield that for certain portions of the curve , the stipulation is self  consistent and for the rest , it is not .",
    "detailed analysis will show that the former is completely consistent .",
    "in particular these calculations correspond to the true minima of the free energy function .",
    "by contrast , the latter ( non  self  consistent ) portion is a consequence of a discontinuous transition which has `` already '' occurred at prior values of the parameters . in particular , the perturbative analysis is highlighting a local extremum and not the true minimum .",
    "we conclude this subsection with the derivation of the lsp ",
    "curve  as well as the introduction of notation that will be used throughout the reminder of the analysis .",
    "assuming @xmath342 , eq.([e : mf_n2 ] ) is trivially satisfied and eq.([e : mf_b2 ] ) defines the `` ambient '' value of @xmath83 which we denote by @xmath344 : @xmath345 note that @xmath346 is _ always _ a solution to the mean  field system .",
    "for simplicity we consider @xmath347 and @xmath60 as the relevant parameters for our system for the remainder of this paper .",
    "let us now consider slight perturbations of @xmath83 about @xmath347 and of @xmath304 about zero .",
    "we thus write @xmath348 with @xmath349 and @xmath350 with @xmath351 and obtain the following approximations by expanding eq.([e : mf_b2 ] ) to lowest order @xmath352 while eq.([e : mf_n2 ] ) , written to a higher approximation than will be immediately necessary , gives us @xmath353 we pause to observe that eq.([kit ] ) and , in general , eq.([e : mf_n2 ] ) , have the symmetry property that with all other quantities fixed , if @xmath304 is a solution then so is @xmath354 .",
    "thus , we might as well assume that @xmath355 .",
    "indeed , we shall adhere to this convention throughout .",
    "assuming now that @xmath60 is variable while @xmath344 is fixed , the @xmath356 limit of eq.([kit ] ) and eq.([e : relnanddelta ] ) yields the tentative phase boundary @xmath357 this _ defines _ the lsp ",
    "curve ; the correspondingly tentative conclusion is that @xmath358 and @xmath359 occurs for @xmath360 while for @xmath361 , @xmath362 . however , the viability of these tentative conclusions depends , in a definitive fashion , on the value of @xmath344 . in particular",
    "an analysis of the higher order terms in eq.([kit ] ) testifies that this picture can not possibly be correct for @xmath363 ; this is the subject of our next subsection .",
    "however , a more difficult analysis shows that this picture is indeed correct for @xmath364 which is the subject matter of the final subsection .",
    "first , we must attend to some necessary details .",
    "in this subsection we will establish some basic properties of the model such as the existence of high and low ",
    "temperature phases along with various monotonicity properties .",
    "in particular we show that at fixed @xmath344 , the quantity @xmath304 , assumed to be non  negative , is non  decreasing with @xmath60 and strictly increasing whenever it is non  zero .",
    "for the benefit of our physics readership , such contentions might typically be _ assumed _ and consequently , the entire subsection could be skipped on a preliminary reading .",
    "however , it is remarked that in the normal ( physics ) course of events , such questions are most often settled by direct perturbative calculation . even for continuous transitions , on some occasions , additional justification is actually required .",
    "sometimes , as in the present work , when the transition is discontinuous , the relevant calculations simply can not be done analytically and then , indeed , one must rely more heavily on abstract methods .    in",
    "what follows , we shall work with the free energy function given by eq.([oiq ] ) with @xmath305 eliminated in favor of @xmath304 according to eq.([vsr ] ) and working with the parameters @xmath60 and @xmath344 .",
    "for simplicity , this will be denoted by @xmath365 but with subscripts omitted unless absolutely necessary .",
    "thus @xmath366 is now notation for the function @xmath367 it is clear that the minimum of @xmath366 corresponds to the minimum of the original three variable free energy function @xmath368 . in the following ,",
    "will use the notation @xmath369 ( with @xmath370 ) as though this defines an unambiguous function .",
    "of course in the case of phase coexistence , this will not be true . in general , then",
    ", @xmath369 will stand for a representative from the set of minimizers at parameter value @xmath60 and all of the results in this subsection hold .",
    "we start with some elementary properties of the phase diagram generated by the corresponding minimization problem .",
    "[ ytz ] consider @xmath366 with @xmath344 fixed and @xmath60 ranging in @xmath371 .",
    "then for all @xmath60 sufficiently large , @xmath366 is minimized by a non ",
    "zero @xmath304 and for all @xmath60 sufficiently small , @xmath329 is minimized by @xmath372 .",
    "we begin with the assertion , gleaned from eq.([vsq ] ) , that along the curves @xmath342 , @xmath329 is minimized by @xmath373 .",

    "conversely , for @xmath360 we may write , adhering to the notation in the proof of theorem [ ukw ] , our usual expression : @xmath497 for @xmath498 from proposition [ tef ] , we know that the quantity @xmath499 agrees with @xmath500 up to quartic order in @xmath304 . thus allowing @xmath501 with @xmath502 we find a non ",

    "let @xmath448 denote the associated limit for the @xmath409 along a further subsequence if necessary .",
    "since @xmath507 we would have , by continuity , @xmath508 indicating that _ at _ @xmath496 , there is a minimizer with positive magnetization in contradiction with proposition [ uyv ] above .",
    "it follows that , under the stated condition @xmath364 , the limit of @xmath369 is zero as @xmath509 while it vanishes below and is positive above . by this ( and any other ) criterion",
    ", the transition at @xmath425 is continuous .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "in this work , we have formulated a lattice model for gang territoriality where red and blue gang agents interact solely through graffiti markings . using a contour argument",
    ", we showed that a phase transition occurs between a well mixed , `` high - temperature '' phase and an ordered , `` low - temperature '' one as the coupling parameter @xmath36 between gang members and graffiti becomes stronger while the graffiti evaporation parameter @xmath42 decreases . in the mean field limit of all  to  all lattice site couplings , we can also identify the tricritical point in phase space that distinguishes the occurrence of a continuous phase transition from a first order one .",
    "we find this point to be located at @xmath510 which corresponds , in terms of the original variables of the problem , to the gang proclivity term @xmath511 . in particular , for @xmath512",
    "the phase transition is continuous and occurs at @xmath513 .",
    "thus , in the mean - field limit , for fixed @xmath514 the ordered  low temperature \" phase arises for @xmath515 , and the `` high temperature '' one is attained on the other side of this inequality .",
    "the transition between the two occurs in a continuous manner across the @xmath516 locus . in the opposite case of @xmath517 ( or @xmath518 )",
    "the phase transition is discontinuous . here",
    ", we also are able to prove that the transition between high and low temperature phases occurs not at @xmath519 , but rather along the @xmath520 curve , so that the phase change occurs earlier in @xmath36 and along a separatrix @xmath521 .    in the context of gang  graffiti interactions",
    ", we may identify the low temperature , clustered phase as pertaining to a high level of antagonism between between rival gangs , where segregation leads to conflict along boundaries .",
    "vice versa , the high temperature , well mixed configuration can be interpreted as a peaceful state , where despite different affiliations , gang members share the same turf .",
    "our mean field results indicate that the confrontational state is surely attained , whether in a continuous or first order manner , for @xmath522 , which represents high gang - graffiti territoriality @xmath36 , low external intervention in graffiti removal @xmath42 and high proclivity @xmath96 for individuals to become gang members .",
    "gang clustering can be avoided by intervening in all three directions : by externally eliminating graffiti ( @xmath42 ) , but also , from a deeper sociological point of view , by decreasing the lure of graffiti tags or of joining gangs in the first place ( @xmath523 ) .",
    "the emergence of a ( continuous or discontinuous ) phase transition shows that it is possible to obtain segregation in a lattice model without invoking direct agent  to  agent coupling ; it is certain that adding such coupling terms to the hamiltonian would allow for even more favorable segregation conditions .",
    "although our work was conceived within the context of gang interactions , the proposed model hamiltonian and the tools used are general enough that our fundamental results may be applicable to several other contexts where territoriality is played out through markings and not through direct contact between players .",
    "many animals , among which wolves , foxes and coyotes , are known to scent  mark their territories as a way of warning intruders of their presence and to exchange internal communication @xcite . at times",
    ", buffer zones can originate between distinct animal clusters where prey species , such as deer or moose , may thrive @xcite .",
    "insects , such as beetles and bees , are also known to avoid previously marked locations as a way to optimize foraging patterns .",
    "similarly to the role of gang graffiti markings , foreign scents lead `` others '' to retreat from already occupied turf or visited patches .",
    "our work also applies to these contexts .",
    "although some stochastic treatments have been recently presented @xcite , classical ecological studies of territoriality are usually carried out via reaction ",
    "diffusion equations where focal points such as dens , burrows or nests are often included @xcite , leading to segregation . within this work on the other hand  whether first order or continuous  agent clustering is a natural consequence of a probabilistic treatment without the need to include any anchoring sites . finally , we are able to connect local microscopic parameters  @xmath524  to the emergence of large scale territorial patterns , be they gang clusters or animal groupings .",

    "red and @xmath527 blue gang members are placed at random on the lattice with possible overlaps .",

    "for example , in table [ tab : fig1 ] , we track the dynamic progression of two sets of parameters . in the top row we set @xmath538 so that 75@xmath539 of the graffiti is retained at each iteration , while in the lower one we set @xmath540 so that only 25@xmath539 of the graffiti is kept . in table [ tab : fig1 ] the left and right hand side plots show agent and graffiti distributions , respectively .",

    "similarly to what we later found in the main analysis , the degree of persistence of the graffiti field  which can be related to @xmath42 in the hamiltonian in eq.[e : hamiltonian ]  yields different qualitative behaviors and , if sufficiently large , may lead to aggregation patterns with distinct red and blue phases .",
