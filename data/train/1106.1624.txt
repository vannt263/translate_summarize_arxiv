    "collaborators examined the spatio - temporal dynamics of active fluids with nematic symmetry in two dimensions , demonstrating the onset of spatially modulated relaxation oscillations and the close analogy between the dynamics of active fluids and that of excitable media  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the spatio - temporal dynamics of an active suspension with polar symmetry .",
    "the model is appropriate to describe systems such as bacterial suspensions , where the particles are swimmers , hence head - tail asymmetric or polar . as a result ,",
    "the active fluid can order in a macroscopic polar state , characterized by a nonzero value of a vector order parameter @xmath0 , describing the mean polarization of the system .",
    "the order parameter can be written in terms of a magnitude @xmath1 and a polar director @xmath2 ( with @xmath3 ) , denoting the direction of spontaneously broken symmetry in the ordered state .",
    "while in the nematic state the director @xmath4 is a headless unit vector because the ordered state is invariant for @xmath5 , the polar state does not possess this symmetry and the polar director @xmath2 is a true unit vector . as a result ,",
    "the continuum equation for a polar active fluids contain terms that are forbidden by symmetry in the case of an active nematic .",
    "these terms describe swimming of the active particles relative to the bulk fluid and yield new self - advection contributions to the continuum equations .",
    "continuum descriptions of the collective dynamics of polar active particles have been discussed before in the literature in two cases : for particles moving on a frictional substrate ( `` dry '' system ) and for particles swimming in a fluid ( active suspension ) .",
    "the hydrodynamics of the dry system is a continuum theory of the vicsek model of flocking , consisting of a collection of self - propelled particles moving on a frictional substrate with noisy aligning rules .",
    "it was first introduced phenomenologically by toner and tu  @xcite and recently derived by explicit coarse graining of the microscopic dynamics  @xcite . in this case",
    "the only conserved variable is the density of active particles as momentum is not conserved .",
    "the theory is then formulated entirely in terms of density and polarization fields and the equations lack galileian invariance due to the presence of the substrate .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations of active suspensions have been written down phenomenologically on the basis of symmetry considerations and also derived from specific microscopic models of a collection of interacting active particles .",
    "the equations used here were first obtained by liverpool and marchetti for a suspensions of cytoskeletal filaments with crosslinking motor proteins  @xcite .",
    "while in this case the filaments may be better described as a  mutually propelled \" , rather than  self - propelled \" , as the activity resulting in propulsion arises from the forces exchanged among filaments by the active cross - linkers , the form of the hydrodynamic equations does not depend on such microscopic details .",
    "this work focuses on pattern formation in polar active suspensions . while the behavior of polar active films in a quasi-1d geometry was discussed before in ref .",
    "@xcite , here we present a systematic study of a two - dimensional system with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "new results include : the derivation of a  phase diagram \" for the system that unifies the analysis of instabilities discussed previously in the literature in various contexts ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - diagram ] ) , the prediction of the traveling vortices regime shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : traveling - vortices ] , the derivation of a low dimensional model that captures the onset of the traveling waves regime , and the prediction that the transitions between the various regimes are discontinuous , allowing for the possibility of coexistence and hysteresis .",
    "we begin by identifying the linear instabilities of the ordered state of polar active fluids , summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - diagram ] .",
    "these instabilities have been discussed before in the literature , either in the context of dry systems _ or _ of active suspensions . here",
    "we highlight the connection between the behavior of the suspension and the dry limit .",
    "to go beyond the linear case , we then integrate numerically the nonlinear hydrodynamic equations for increasing values of activity .",
    "in a polar system there exist two classes of active terms .",
    "the first class , with strength controlled by a parameter we call @xmath6 , is present in both systems of nematic and polar symmetry and describes active stresses induced by coupling of orientation and flow .",
    "the sign of @xmath6 identifies active systems that generate contractile stresses ( @xmath7 ) versus those that generate tensile stresses ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the second class , with strength controlled by a parameter we call @xmath9 , is unique to polar fluids and describes a variety of nonequilibrium advective contributions to the dynamics arising from the particles self propulsion .",
    "both parameters are ultimately controlled by the activity of the system , as embodied for instance by the rate of adenosine - triphosphate ( atp ) consumption in motor - filament suspensions or by the forces exerted by swimmers on the surrounding fluid in a bacterial suspension .",
    "for this reason , and to reduce the number of independent parameters , in most of the following we take @xmath10 , with @xmath11 a numerical factor of order one , and discuss the behavior of the system for increasing values of the activity @xmath6 . upon increasing @xmath6",
    "we observe a variety of increasingly complex patterns .",
    "a regime that is unique to polar systems consists of bands extending in the direction orthogonal to that of mean order ( @xmath12 direction ) and traveling along @xmath12 .",
    "although traveling bands have been seen in dry systems , either via direct simulations of vicsek models  @xcite or by numerical solution of the continuum theory  @xcite , there are important qualitative differences between the traveling bands in dry systems and in suspensions . in dry systems",
    "the bands appear to be solitary waves of ordered regions of high density and polarization traveling in a disordered background . in suspensions , in contrast",
    ", the traveling waves are mainly controlled by coupled oscillations in the flow and the direction of the polarization .",
    "they can be understood in terms of a simplified reaction - diffusion - advection model that highlights the crucial role played by active stresses in providing the energy input needed for setting up the pattern formation and by advective terms unique to polar systems in controlling the traveling nature of the pattern .",
    "as the activity is further increased , the traveling wave pattern is replaced by more complex spatial structures , including oscillating flows with pairs of traveling vortices , and eventually chaotic behavior .    finally , spatial patterns in active polar fluids in two dimensions have also been discussed by voituriez et al  @xcite .",
    "these authors include a coupling between splay and density fluctuations that is present in both equilibrium and active polar fluids , but neglect the convective couplings unique to active polar systems that are responsible for the oscillatory or traveling nature of some of the spatial patterns found in the present work .",
    "the modulated flowing phases identified in ref .",
    "@xcite are characterized by a finite steady flow induced by activity , but do not represent traveling patterns .",
