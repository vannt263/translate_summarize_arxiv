    "when the gate voltage is chosen such that @xmath156 , half of the energy difference between the single - particle bonding and antibonding level , the bonding state ( mainly given by the right dot state due to the detuning ) tends to be occupied with a free spin and josephson coupling through the antibonding state is enhanced ( due to @xmath154 ) .",

    "the shape of the contributions of the spin @xmath126 states reflect that the system is composed of one effective level coupled to the superconducting leads ( giving rise to the rounded green region ) and a second effective level which is uncoupled ( leading to the sharp triangular feature ) .",

    "therefore the josephson current does not reveal a @xmath0-phase as it was observed for the serial double dot in the single - level transport situation .",
    "the transport through the parallel dot is blocked , whenever the coupled bonding level is occupied with a spin @xmath126 and hence cooper pair transfer is not possible .    as in the serial setup we use the situation of a finite coulomb interaction as the reference situation to study so interaction effects .",
    "the effect of coulomb interaction is summarized in fig .",

    "[ fig : parallel_u1 ] ( c - d ) .",
    "for simplicity we consider @xmath120 , the physical behavior is qualitatively not affected by a finite coulomb interaction .",
    "three different effects are visible due to the so coupling : ( i ) it has a similar effect on the current as the coulomb interaction in the sense that no state of spin @xmath179 is accessible in the vicinity of @xmath180 , allowing for a direct transition between a singlet and a triplet state .",
    "( ii ) in contrast to the case without so coupling , the discontinuous transition between positive and suppressed current is replaced by a smooth crossover as it was observed in the serial double - dot setup .",
    "this smooth transition again originates from the coupling between the singlet and the triplet many - body ground state .",
    "this effect makes the regions in which the josephson current tends to be blocked distinguishable .",
    "the reason is that in the subspace with one nambu particle no current can flow through the bonding level when it is singly occupied .",
    "however , when the transporting bonding level tends to be blocked with one spin and at the same time also the antibonding level is , then so coupling induces coupling to the current carrying singlet state .",
    "therefore the region in which the current is fully blocked becomes much smaller ( as expected for @xmath120 when comparing to the small @xmath0-phase in the noninteracting serial double dot studied before ) .",
    "( iii ) we observe the absence of a @xmath0-phase originating from the fact that only a single level is effectively coupled to the superconducting leads being insensitive to the magnetic moment of the uncoupled level .",
    "the josephson current however appears to be sensitive to the occupation of the ( uncoupled ) antibonding level _ through the so coupling _ , which leads to discontinuities in the current , between the regions where the antibonding level tends to be occupied or empty .",
    "we studied the effect of so interaction @xmath143 on the equilibrium supercurrent through a serially coupled double quantum dot as a minimal model to describe a multi - orbital system , attached to superconducting leads .",
    "the so effects were illustrated in a study of the josephson current and contrasted with effects due to coulomb interaction and of coupling asymmetries .",
    "we find a pronounced dependence on the orientation of an applied magnetic field with respect to the spin - orbit interaction : for @xmath181 , the so interaction does not qualitatively affect the singlet - triplet transition .",
    "however , for a finite orthogonal component , @xmath139 , this transition is smoothened as the singlet - triplet transition is inhibited by an anticrossing of the corresponding levels . extending the study to finite temperatures",
    "we find that @xmath139 has a similar effect as the coulomb interaction in the stabilization of a @xmath0-phase arising around zero gate voltage .",
    "we finally discuss the josephson current for the situation of an effective decoupling of double - dot states , which occurs for a symmetric parallel dot configuration , and point out the effect of so interaction in this more general setup .",
