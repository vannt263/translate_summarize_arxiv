    "our knowledge of the nature of comets , their structure , composition , dynamical history , and modes of activity has greatly improved over the last twenty years .",
    "the one event that constituted a mile - stone in the study of comets was the space mission _ giotto _ , which provided the first close - up picture of a comet s heart - its nucleus .",
    "several other space missions to comets followed , crowned by the very recent _ deep impact _",
    "mission @xcite , aimed at revealing properties of the nucleus interior . as observational data on comets has been accumulating , theoretical studies and modeling have started to develop , in order to interpret , predict and explain new findings and discoveries .",
    "comets consist of frozen gases and dust .",
    "the dust consists of silicates and organic materials , while the frozen gases are mostly water and a few constituents more volatile than water .",
    "solar heat , not reflected or radiated from the surface of the nucleus is primarily used to evaporate ices from exposed areas .",
    "the remainder of the heat penetrates into the nucleus , where it can cause numerous physico - chemical reaction processes , which eventually affect measurable properties at the nucleus surface . over the past two decades",
    ", numerical studies have attempted to integrate some of the more influential processes with a numerical representation of a comet nucleus , in order to better understand the rather unpredictable behavior of comets @xcite .",
    "the most obvious property of comet nuclei is the _ lack of _ spherical symmetry . besides the fact that self - gravity , which dictates the spherical shape of larger celestial bodies , is negligible in comets , the main energy source  solar radiation",
    " is unevenly distributed over the nucleus surface , not only because of daily variation and spin axis inclination , but also because of the large orbital variations , characteristic to comets , but not to other bodies of the solar system . nevertheless , theoretical models of nuclei have so far assumed spherical symmetry , or have circumvented this assumption by crude approximations .",
    "modeling began with very simple pictures of the nucleus . a few physical processes with simplifying assumptions provided crude but insightful explanations for the comet nucleus behavior @xcite",
    "however , these models were able to give only average results and explain only the general behavior of comets .",
    "the models were limited to a single dimension , mostly based on spherical symmetry ( the _ fast rotator _ approximation ) .",
    "they simulated heat flow in a mixture of ice and rock ( dust ) with uniform boundary conditions for the solar flux , radiative emission and substance sublimation .",
    "additional physico - chemical processes , e.g. , amorphous ice crystallization , surface erosion etc . , were added later on to produce a more elaborate physical picture .",
    "as these models did not take into consideration spatial variations in surface temperature , they provided a fair approximation only for the internal part of the nucleus , where these variations fade .    for more realistic surface results , _",
    "slow rotator _ approaches were adopted .",
    "a `` 1.5-d '' model @xcite was suggested , in which , a 1-d model was applied with boundary conditions of an equatorial point on a rotating nucleus .",
    "this way , diurnal boundary conditions differences were taken into considerations , and an upper limit for production rate was achieved when the sub - solar ( high noon ) flux was adopted for the entire surface of the sunlit hemisphere .",
    "this model , as its predecessor , does not calculate lateral flow .",
    "a semi - lateral approach was taken for the 2.5-d model @xcite where a meridian flow was calculated , and boundary conditions were taken as in the 1.5-d model .    a different approach is the quasi-3-d procedure @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "every point on the nucleus surface is calculated ( with the appropriate local boundary condition ) with radial flow only , so calculations are similar to the 1.5-d method , but boundary conditions are of the total sphere , just as with a 3-d approach .",
    "still , each point ( or element ) of the surface evolves independently of the others and only radial conduction is considered .",
    "now that modeling has made significant progress towards understanding the general structure and behavior of comets , more sophisticated and realistic pictures of the nucleus are required .",
    "the purpose of the present research project is to develop a _ fully _ 3-d model of a comet nucleus .",
    "as in the quasi-3-d , boundary conditions will be taken for the entire sphere , but now , meridional and azimuthal heat fluxes are calculated as well .",
    "gas production and flow in the interior of the comet are not included in the present model . in order to compare production rates of volatiles with the observed ones at large distances from the nucleus , when the surface is not resolved ( in fact ,",
    "not even seen ) @xcite , a sum of all local production rates can be calculated .",
    "however , the model will provide a detailed description of the surface activity as well .    in the 3-d model , in contrast to the older models ,",
    "all the grid elements need to be solved simultaneously , so the computational load increases dramatically .",
    "this may limit the spatial resolution of the comet if we require a solution in a reasonable time .",
    "however , as modern computers advance rapidly , the grid density may increase for the same calculation time .",
    "this model may be scaled for super - computers to allow even denser grid resolution .",
    "our purpose is to calculate numerically a variety of physical processes that are believed to take place inside a comet nucleus . in order to do so",
    ", physical equations and models should be adjusted for discrete calculations .",
    "the basic adjustment is dividing the nucleus into elements via a grid , and simplifying the problem by assuming a `` homogeneous lumped system '' approximation for each element .",

    "south - pole temperatures were always lower than the north - pole ones ; however , for small tilt angles ( below 40@xmath94 ) the difference was found to be more significant .",
    "when the tilted nucleus is at perihelion , the south - pole is directed away from the sun , not receiving any solar flux .",
    "the only heat flowing into the south pole is from non - lateral conduction , which is negligible relative to the solar flux .",
    "the south - pole remains hidden from solar flux until the nucleus nears the equinox , where the sun is directly above the nucleus equator , and the south pole is exposed to the sun at a very low angle . passing the equinox point ,",
    "the south pole is exposed to direct flux .",
    "as the comet retreats from equinox , the flux received by the ever exposed south - pole depends on the tilt angle , making the small tilt angle pole receive only a fraction of the flux received by a high tilt pole .",
    "the lowest value of the maximal surface temperature is less than 130@xmath94k . at such temperatures crystallization of amorphous water ice proceeds",
    "very slowly : the characteristic timescale is of the order of days , competing with the dynamical ( orbital ) timescale .",

    "the north - pole crystallization front did not exceed the depth of 2  m in both models , although maximum temperatures were the highest .",
    "this happened due to the rapid exposure of the pole to the solar flux .",
    "when the pole is hidden from the sun ( most of the time ) , the cooling boundary conditions with only small amount of heat that has been absorbed during solar exposure , prevent the deeper temperature from increasing , and thus crystallization propagates only to a shallow depth . this may indicate that pristine material may be found at the north - pole at small depths but not at the surface .",

    ". this effect would distort the sphericity of the model ( numerical grid ) . on the other hand ,",
    "as stated above , most of the surface of comet nuclei is covered by a dust mantle , presumably of high porosity , and water vapor is produced and ejected from an ice - rich layer lying beneath the dust mantle .",

    "<S> a 3-d numerical model of comet nuclei is presented . </S>",
    "<S> an implicit numerical scheme was developed for the thermal evolution of a spherical nucleus composed of a mixture of ice and dust . </S>",
    "<S> the model was tested against analytical solutions , simplified numerical solutions , and 1-d thermal evolution codes . </S>",
    "<S> the 3-d code was applied to comet 67p / churyumov - gerasimenko ; surface temperature maps and the internal thermal structure was obtained as function of depth , longitude and hour angle . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the spin axis tilt on the surface temperature distribution was studied in detail . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that for small tilt angles , relatively low temperatures may prevail on near - pole areas , despite lateral heat conduction . </S>",
    "<S> a high - resolution run for a comet model of 67p / churyumov - gerasimenko with low tilt angle , allowing for crystallization of amorphous ice , showed that the amorphous / crystalline ice boundary varies significantly with depth as a function of cometary latitude .    and    3-d numerical model , comet nucleus , thermal evolution 96.30.cw </S>"
