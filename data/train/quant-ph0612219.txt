    "the evaluation of the amount of _ classical information _ which can be reliably transmitted by _",
    "quantum states _ is a major problem of quantum information . early works in this direction , devoted mainly to memoryless channels , for which consecutive signal transmissions through the channel are not correlated , allowed the determination of capacities in many instances @xcite- @xcite and proved their additivity .",
    "recently much attention was given to quantum channels with memory @xcite- @xcite in the hope that the capacity of such channels be superadditive and could be enhanced by using entangled input states .",
    "contrary to this expectation , for bosonic memory channels without input energy constraints , the additivity conjecture was proven leaving no hope to enhance the channel capacity using entangled inputs @xcite . however , for more realistic situation where the energy of input gaussian states is finite , it was shown that entangling two consecutive uses of the channel with memory introduced by a correlated noise enhances the overall channel capacity @xcite . for each value of the noise correlation parameter",
    ", there exists an optimal degree of entanglement ( not necessarily maximal entanglement ) that maximizes the channel capacity .",
    "other examples of quantum channels with memory introduced by a correlated noise include qubit pauli channels @xcite . for these channels",
    "it was shown that if the noise correlations are stronger than some critical value , maximally entangled input states enhance the channel capacity compared to product input states .",
    "quantum channels with correlated noise in dimensions @xmath1 were not considered in the literature in this context , except for @xcite , which appeared after our work was completed and presented , where a class of @xmath0-dimensional quantum channels with memory is considered for which maximally entangled states maximize the channel capacity beyond some memory threshold .",
    "the @xmath0-dimensional channels correspond to a kind of intermediate system between the qubit and the gaussian channels .",
    "therefore , we expect to find new features that this intermediate dimensionality can add to the known facts . we shall consider @xmath0-dimensional quantum channel which are generalizations of the pauli qubit channels studied in @xcite .",
    "we start with the introduction of the classical capacity of quantum channels , consider explicitly two examples of @xmath0-dimensional quantum channels with memory and present results on their capacity .",
    "the action of a transmission channel on an initial quantum state described by density operator @xmath2 is given by a linear completely positive ( cp ) map @xmath3 .",
    "the amount of classical information which can be reliably transmitted through a quantum channel is given by the holevo - schumacher - westmoreland bound @xcite as the maximum of mutual information @xmath4 taken over all possible ensembles @xmath5 of input states @xmath6 with _ a priori _ probabilities @xmath7 .",
    "the mutual information of an ensemble @xmath5 is defined as @xmath8\\ ] ] where @xmath9 $ ] is the von neumann entropy .",
    "if we find a state @xmath10 which minimizes the output entropy @xmath11 and replace the first term in ( [ i ] ) by the largest possible entropy given by the entropy of the maximally mixed state , we obtain the following bound @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the dimension of @xmath2 . generalizing the arguments of @xcite , this bound can be shown @xcite to become tight for the channels which we consider .    in general ,",
    "being a linear cp map , any quantum channel can be represented by an operator - sum : @xmath14 , @xmath15 . in order to describe @xmath16 uses of the same quantum channel",
    ", we have to consider the hilbert space of the initial states , which is a tensor product such that @xmath17 . the repeated use ( @xmath16 times ) of the channel",
    "is cp map @xmath18 @xmath19 represented by the kraus operators acting in @xmath20-dimensional space the channel is memoryless if the kraus operators can be factorized according to @xmath21 where each operator @xmath22 represents one single use of the channel and the normalized probability distribution @xmath23 is factorized into probabilities which are independent for each use of the channel . on the other hand , a memory effect is introduced when correlations are present between consecutive uses of the channel , e.g. , when each use of the channel depends on the preceding one in such a way that @xmath23 is given by a product of conditional probabilities @xmath24 .",
    "indeed , the correlations between the consecutive uses of the channel act as if the channel `` remembers '' the first signal and acts on the second one using this `` knowledge '' .",
    "this type of channels is called a markov channel as the probability @xmath25 corresponds to a markov chain of order 2 .",
    "following @xcite one can introduce a markov type of memory effect by choosing probabilities @xmath26 which include a correlated noise : @xmath27 .",
    "the memory parameter @xmath28 $ ] characterizes the correlation `` strength '' .",
    "indeed , for @xmath29 , the probabilities of two subsequent uses of the channel are independent , whereas for @xmath30 , the correlations are the strongest ones .",
    "we shall consider channels given by a product of pairwise correlated channels @xmath31 where @xmath32 is determined by ( [ product ] ) .",
    "these channels are not strictly markov : due to the pair wise correlations , @xmath33 quantum states sent are split into @xmath16 consecutive pairs .",
    "the actions of the channel on the states belonging to the same pair are correlated according to @xmath34 , whereas , the actions of the channel on the states from different pairs are uncorrelated . however , even these `` limited '' ( within each pair ) correlations result in the advantages of using entangled input states as it was shown in @xcite .",
    "we shall study @xmath0-dimensional heisenberg channels @xcite which may be considered as a generalization pauli qubit channels .",
    "the kraus operators are therefore given by the `` error '' or `` displacement '' operators acting on @xmath0-dimensional states .",
    "@xmath35 where the index @xmath36 characterizes the displacement ( of a mode ) or cyclic shift of the basis vectors of the pointer basis by analogy with the bit - flip , and the index @xmath16 characterizes the phase shift .",
    "the displacement operators form a heisenberg group @xcite with commutation relation @xmath37 for two uses of a @xmath0-dimensional heisenberg channel the cp map ( [ product ] ) becomes @xmath38 where @xmath2 is a @xmath39 density matrix .",
    "the markov - type joint probability reads @xmath40 notice the presence of a product of two kronecker deltas representing the noise correlations separately for displacements ( index @xmath36 ) and for phase shifts ( index @xmath16 ) .",
    "in addition , we introduce both , phase correlations ( @xmath41 ) as well as phase anticorrelations ( @xmath42 ) with a new parameter @xmath43 characterizing the type of the phase correlations in the channel .",
    "for @xmath44 such a distinction disappears as phase correlations @xmath41 and phase anticorrelations @xmath42 coincide . note that for infinite dimensional bosonic gaussian channel the phase anticorrelations provided an enhancement of the channel capacity by entangled states @xcite .",
    "we consider two types of @xmath0-dimensional channels , characterized by the following sets of @xmath45 :    0.5 cm _ a. quantum depolarizing ( qd ) channel _ : @xmath46 if @xmath47 and @xmath48 otherwise . as @xmath49",
    "the channel is characterized by a single parameter @xmath50 $ ] reminiscent of the``shrinking factor '' of the two - qubit qd channel",
    ".    0.5 cm _ b. quasi - classical depolarizing ( qcd ) channel _ : @xmath51 with @xmath52 if @xmath53 and @xmath54 otherwise .",
    "the probabilities of the displacements of the same mode @xmath36 are equal regardless of the phase shift ( determined by @xmath16 ) and the probability of `` zero '' displacement ( @xmath53 ) differs from the others that are equal .",
    "we call this channel quasi - classical as a classical depolarizing channel changes the amplitude of the modes of a classical signal with some probability , but there is no quantum phase in classical signals . since @xmath55",
    "the channel is characterized by the parameter @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "for these @xmath0-dimensional channels , following @xcite and using their covariance we have proven @xcite that the bound ( [ bound ] ) is tight , i.e. , in order to determine the capacity of the channels we have to find an _ optimal",
    "_ state @xmath10 that minimizes the output entropy @xmath57 .    by analogy with the two - dimensional case @xcite",
    "we look for an optimal @xmath10 as a pure input state @xmath58 where @xmath59 this ansatz allows us to go from a product state to a maximally entangled state by changing the parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 . indeed , the choice @xmath62 and @xmath63 results in a product state whereas the choice @xmath64 and @xmath63 results in a maximally entangled state .",
    "taking into account the form ( [ u ] ) of the displacement operators @xmath65 , the probability distribution @xmath66 ( [ pmn ] ) and the probability parameters @xmath45 for both channels , we evaluate the action of the channel given by eq .",
    "( [ emn ] ) on the initial state @xmath67 in the form ( [ iniphi ] ) .",
    "then we diagonalize the output states and find their von neumann entropy that allows us to obtain the mutual information according to eq .",
    "( [ i ] ) .",
    "we evaluate the action of the qd channel given by eqs .",
    "( [ emn]-[pmn ] ) and of the qcd channel given by eqs .",
    "( [ emn]-[pmn ] ) on a pure initial state given by eq .",
    "( [ iniphi ] ) .",
    "the analytic results of these evaluations are presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "here we shall present and discuss some figures displaying these analytic results , but before we discuss whether these results provide an _ optimal _ @xmath10 .",

    "then , if @xmath10 is an _ optimal _",
    "state then @xmath74 is also an optimal state .",
    "therefore we can restrict our search from the whole space @xmath75 to @xmath76 .",
    "finally , using ( [ u ] ) , it is straightforward to show that any state from @xmath76 is a convex combination of pure states @xmath77 where @xmath78 restricting our search to the states of the form ( [ state ] ) we reduce the number of real optimization parameters from @xmath79 to @xmath80 , which can still be a large number . in order to reduce this number to 1 , we consider the following ansatz @xmath81 interpolating between the product state ( @xmath82 ) and the maximally entangled state ( @xmath83 ) . using the one - parameter family of input states @xmath84 , in fig .  1 we present the mutual information @xmath85 for different values of @xmath70 .",
    "the mutual information is monotonously modified when @xmath70 goes from a product state to a maximally entangled state , whereas the crossover point @xmath86 stays intact .",
    "however , we can not guarantee that no other entangled state minimizes the entropy @xmath87 and provides therefore the maximum of the mutual information .    in the sequel",

    "3 , compare the curves @xmath89 from ( a ) with ( b ) and from ( c ) with ( d ) ) .",
    "however , any non vanishing degree of the `` entanglement - non - friendly '' correlations reveals the parity effect .",
    "the anticorrelated phases remind us the bosonic gaussian channels considered in @xcite where the @xmath98 quadratures are correlated while the @xmath103 quadratures are anticorrelated . however , the existence of the crossover point is a significant difference with the case of the gaussian channels for which each value of the noise correlation parameter determines an optimal degree of entanglement ( different from maximal entanglement ) maximizing the mutual information .",
    "a challenging open problem is to find a link between these results for @xmath0-dimensional channels and the results obtained in @xcite for gaussian channels with finite energy input signals .",
    "although we have shown that for certain cases of @xmath0-dimensional channels maximally entangled states provide higher values of mutual information than product states , a full proof of the optimality of maximally entangled input states is still missing .",
    "however if it is true , the presented parametrization illustrating a `` monotonous '' deformation of the curves of mutual information vs. the memory parameter during the transition from product states to maximally entangled states shows that at @xmath86 the optimal state `` jumps '' from the product to the maximally entangled state .",
    "the `` sharp '' character of this transition is due to the fact that the crossover points stay intact during the deformation of the curves ."
