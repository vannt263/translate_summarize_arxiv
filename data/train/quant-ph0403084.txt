    "suppose that we have written , in a sort of table , the statistical data collected from a group of experiments  the nature of which can be classical , quantum , or something else . suppose that we also want to store this table s data in a compact way .",
    "how could we proceed ?    in this paper",
    "it is shown that , given the situation described above , when we try to store or organise the table s data in a more compact way we find that real vectors can be associated to preparations and results , in a way which , for quantum mechanical phenomena , is essentially the same as hardy s representation of ` states ' and ` measurement outcomes '  @xcite .",
    "this curious fact may offer new points of view for looking at some of the current ` foundational ' issues in quantum mechanics .",
    "the ideas here presented are a summary of those developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , to which the reader is referred for further details .",
    "the emphasis in this paper is on the main idea of a ` table decomposition ' , and on the implications of the latter for various topics discussed in this conference .",
    "imagine that we are in a laboratory , performing experiments of various kinds to study some interesting phenomena ; the purpose of the experiments is to statistically study the correlations among different kinds of these phenomena .",
    "in general , we try to reproduce a given phenomenon  either by controllably preparing it at will , or simply by waiting for its occurrence  , to observe which concomitant phenomena , or _",
    "results _ , occur .    some experiments present common features",
    ": for example , part of the preparation can be the same for some of them .",
    "we separate ideally each experiment into a _ preparation _ and an _ intervention _ ; the latter also delimits the kind of results which can be obtained , which implies that if we are told a result , we know which intervention was made .",
    "we then consider a set of preparations and a set of interventions , with the clause that sensible experiments may be made by combining each of the preparations with each of the interventions ( preparations or interventions which do not satisfy this condition are set aside for the moment ) .",
    "thus , suppose that we have @xmath0 different preparations @xmath1 , and a given number of possible interventions @xmath2 , each with a different number @xmath3 of results @xmath4 ( mutually exclusive and exhaustive ) , where the number @xmath3 depends on the particular intervention @xmath5 .",
    "the total number of results , counted from all interventions , is @xmath6 .    through repetitions of the experiments , or through theoretical assumptions , or just by analogy with other experiments which we have already seen and which we judge similar to those that are now under study",
    ", we can write down a table @xmath7 with the probabilities that we assign to every result , for every intervention and preparation . the table may look like the following :    cc|ccccccc & & @xmath8&@xmath9 & @xmath10 & @xmath11 & @xmath12 & @xmath13 + @xmath14 &    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]      + @xmath15&@xmath15&@xmath15&@xmath15&@xmath15&@xmath15&@xmath15    such a table has , notwithstanding the limiting infinite size , rank @xmath16 , and so we can associate to every preparation and to every result a @xmath17-dimensional vector .",
    "the preparation vectors , however , lie on a @xmath18-dimensional ( affine ) hyper - plane , as in the numerical example previously discussed .",
    "it can be shown indeed  @xcite that the resulting set of preparation vectors is equivalent to the standard bloch - sphere for two - level quantum systems .",
    "this was just an example , but all quantum - mechanical concepts like density matrix , positive - operator - valued measure , and completely positive map can be expressed in an equivalent table - vector formalism  @xcite ( e.g. , the relation with the trace rule is quickly shown in the appendix ) .",
    "the following discussion concentrates on the possible relations among the ideas hitherto presented and ideas presented by other authors in this conference .",
    "the reader is referred to ref .",
    "@xcite for a more general and detailed discussion .      in sect .",
    "[ sec : decom ] , we quickly introduced the preparations , interventions , and results @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and the probabilities @xmath22 which make up the table .",
    "let us define them more clearly .",
    "symbols like @xmath23 and @xmath5 represent propositions which together describe an actual , well - defined procedure to set up an experiment , e.g.  @xmath24 _ _  etc . ,  and @xmath25 _ _  etc .",
    "the separation of the experiment s description into the two propositions is not unique , and indeed more kinds of separations can be considered .",
    "a symbol like @xmath26 represents a proposition which describes the results of an experiment , e.g.  @xmath27 _ _ ; it is then clear that it depends on the particular experiment being performed .",
    "the probability @xmath28 is consequently defined as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a proposition representing the rest of the experimental details and our prior knowledge . as representing the ` agent ' .",
    "] we are thus considering probability theory as extended logic  @xcite , an approach which will prove to be , in the following , powerful , flexible , and intuitive at once .",
    "usually , many repetitions of the same experiment are made and the relative frequencies of the different results of the intervention are observed . _ in this case , given a judgement of total exchangeability of the experiment s repetitions , the probability is practically equal to the observed frequency of the result _ , thanks to de  finetti s representation theorem  @xcite .",
    "but the probability can also be assigned on grounds of similarity with other experiments , or just by theoretical assumptions .",
    "note that the table is silent with regard to the probabilities for the preparations or the interventions , @xmath31 and @xmath32 . in",
    "a given ` situation ' @xmath30 , if _ we _ decide which preparation and intervention to perform , say @xmath33 and @xmath34 , then these probabilities are @xmath35 and @xmath36 of course ( which amounts to saying that `` we know what we re doing '' ) .",
    "if it is someone else who is deciding the particular preparation and intervention , then the probabilities must be assigned in some other way , e.g.  by asking `` which preparation are you making ? '' , or by using some other knowledge , and they will in general differ from @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the difference between these probabilities and those of eq .",
    "is somehow analogous to the difference between initial conditions and equations of motion in classical mechanics : the theory concerns only the latter , while the former has to be specified on a case - by - case basis .",
    "the probabilities of the results of a given intervention and a given preparation form a probability distribution , because the results were arranged so as to be mutually exclusive and exhaustive .",
    "this implies that , for two results @xmath39 and @xmath40 of a given intervention @xmath5 and for a given preparation @xmath41 , we also have the trivial identity @xmath42    but with probability theory as logic we can also evaluate , for a given preparation @xmath41 , the disjoint probability for the results @xmath43 and @xmath44 of two _ different _ interventions @xmath45 and @xmath46 , just using the product and sum rules : @xmath47&= { p}[({{\\textsf{\\emph{r}}}}'\\land{{\\textsf{\\emph{m}}}}')\\lor ( { { \\textsf{\\emph{r}}}}''\\land { { \\textsf{\\emph{m } } } } '' ) { \\mathpunct{|}}{{\\textsf{\\emph{s}}}}_j\\land { { \\textsf{\\emph{q}}}}],\\\\ & = \\begin{aligned}[t ] & { p}({{\\textsf{\\emph{r}}}}'{\\mathpunct{|}}{{\\textsf{\\emph{m}}}}'\\land { { \\textsf{\\emph{s}}}}_j\\land { { \\textsf{\\emph{q}}}})\\times { p}({{\\textsf{\\emph{m}}}}'{\\mathpunct{|}}{{\\textsf{\\emph{s}}}}_j\\land { { \\textsf{\\emph{q}}}})+\\mbox{}\\\\ & { p}({{\\textsf{\\emph{r}}}}''{\\mathpunct{|}}{{\\textsf{\\emph{m}}}}''\\land { { \\textsf{\\emph{s}}}}_j\\land { { \\textsf{\\emph{q}}}})\\times { p}({{\\textsf{\\emph{m}}}}''{\\mathpunct{|}}{{\\textsf{\\emph{s}}}}_j\\land { { \\textsf{\\emph{q } } } } ) , \\end{aligned}\\\\ & = [ { \\bm{r } } ' { p}({{\\textsf{\\emph{m}}}}'{\\mathpunct{|}}{{\\textsf{\\emph{s}}}}_j\\land { { \\textsf{\\emph{q}}}})+ { \\bm{r } } '' { p}({{\\textsf{\\emph{m}}}}''{\\mathpunct{|}}{{\\textsf{\\emph{s}}}}_j\\land { { \\textsf{\\emph{q } } } } ) ] { \\cdot}{\\bm{s}}_j , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where it is assumed that @xmath48 , i.e. , we are sure that one or the other intervention was performed .",
    "the content of the formula above is intuitive : the occurrence of the result @xmath43 implies that the intervention @xmath45 was performed , and so analogously for the result @xmath44 and the intervention @xmath46 .",
    "then the probability of getting the one or the other result depends in turn on the probability that the one or the other intervention was made , hence these probabilities appear in the last line of the above equation .",
    "however , as already said , the probabilities of these interventions are _ not _ contained in the table , but must be given on a case - by - case basis .    as a result , the two disjoint probabilities in eqs .   and",
    "` behave ' differently , and the reason for this is intuitively clear .",
    "however , we can partially trace in this fact the source of much research and discussion on partially ordered lattices and quantum logics for the set of intervention results  @xcite . roughly speaking ,",
    "the point is that , for a classical system , there is the theoretical possibility of joining all possible interventions ( measurements ) in a single `` total intervention '' : the table associated to a classical system can then be considered as having only one intervention ; thus one needs never consider the case of eq .  .",
    "however , such `` total intervention '' is excluded in quantum mechanics , and one is thus forced to consider the case of eq .  .",
    "from the point of view of probability theory as logic , instead , there is no need for non - boolean structures thanks to the possibility of changing and adapting , by means of bayes theorem , the _ context _ ( also called ` prior knowledge '  @xcite or ` data '  @xcite ) of a probability , i.e. , the proposition to the right of the conditional symbol ` @xmath49 . '      on the other hand , we may have the following scenario : we have repeated instances of a given preparation , but we do not know which . by performing interventions on these instances and observing the results , we can estimate which preparation is being made . introducing the proposition @xmath50 representing the results",
    "thus obtained , we have @xmath51 this is a standard `` inverse - inference '' result of bayesian analysis  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch .  4 ) .",
    "the probability @xmath52 can be written in terms of scalar products of result and preparation vectors , but the probability distribution @xmath53 depends on the prior knowledge that one has in each specific case . if we now want to _ predict",
    "_ which result will occur in a new intervention @xmath5 , we have the following probability : @xmath54 i.e. , we can effectively associate the vector @xmath55 to the unknown preparation .",
    "a further kind of scenario is this : we have a brand - new kind of preparation , i.e. , a new phenomenon , still untested .",
    "it has _ no place _ in our probability table ; yet _ we think that we could reserve a new column to it without making substantial changes to our table s decomposition ( by which we mean that the table s rank @xmath56 would not change)_. given this , in order to associate a vector to this new preparation we proceed as in the preceding scenario , performing interventions and observing results .",
    "the result is that eqs",
    ".   and   also apply in this case .",
    "note that there is no conflict between our talking about `` unknown preparations '' and fuchs criticism of the term ` unknown quantum state '  @xcite .",
    "a preparation , as we have seen , is a well - defined procedure ( that can be shown or described to others , etc . )  to set up a given physical situation ; on the other hand , fuchs meaning of ` quantum state ' is ` density matrix '  @xcite , which corresponds ( more or less ) to the preparation _ vector _ instead .",
    "thus , consider the two sentences `` it is unknown to me which kind of laser and of beam splitter are used in this experiment '' and `` i do not know with which probability the detector behind the vertical filter will click '' : the latter sentence is nonsensical from a bayesian point of view , because there are no ` unknown ' degrees of belief ; but the former sentence is unquestionably meaningful .",
    "thus , even if the _ preparation _",
    "is unknown to us , we can _ always _ associate a preparation _ vector _ to it .",
    "some remarks have already been made in sect .",
    "[ sec : decom ] after the derivation of the formula @xmath57 with regard to the fact that the vectors @xmath58 and @xmath59 do not have any physical meaning _ separately _ : a given preparation vector @xmath60 tells us nothing if we do not have an intervention - result vector @xmath61 ; even less if we know nothing about the set of intervention results .",
    "it follows that the preparation vectors also lack any _ probabilistic _ meaning _ per se _ : they are _ not _ probabilities _ nor _ collections of probabilities  they are just mathematical objects which yield probabilities when combined in a given way with objects of similar kind .",
    "this , in particular , is true for density matrices , as we have seen that they are just a particular case of preparation vectors .",
    "it is slightly incorrect , as well , to say that probabilities are ` encoded ' or ` contained ' in the ( quantum ) preparation vectors : rather , they are _ parts _ of an encoding .    from these considerations ,",
    "the quantum state ( the density matrix ) appears to be _",
    "part _ of a state of belief , and not the ` whole ' state of belief  @xcite .",
    "perhaps the point is that caves , fuchs , and schack s notion of a ` quantum ' state of belief implicitly assumes the _ existence _ and the _ particular structure _ of the whole set of quantum positive - operator - valued measures ( i.e. , the interventions ) .",
    "this is an important difference from a ` usual ' degree of belief @xmath62 which does not need to be combined with other mathematical objects to reveal its content .",
    "it has already been remarked that the kind of vector representation arising from the table decomposition is essentially the same as hardy s  @xcite .",
    "the derivation presented here can be seen as a sort of shortcut for his derivation , but it implies something more .",
    "hardy supposes that it is possible to represent a preparation by means of a @xmath56-dimensional vector with @xmath63 because most physical theories have some structure which relates different measured quantities ; but the reasoning behind the decomposition of sect .",
    "[ sec : decom ] shows that this possibility exists even without a theory that describes the data ( indeed , the question arises : has this possibility any physical meaning at all ? )    in any case , the idea of a ` probability table ' and its decomposition has probably very little usefulness in experimental applications , but provides a very simple approach to study the mathematical and geometrical structures of classical and quantum theories , and offers a different way to look at their `` foundational '' and `` interpretative '' issues .",
    "this approach is even more general than other standard ones based , e.g. , on @xmath64-algebras , or even jordan - banach - algebras  @xcite , or on convex state - spaces .",
    "is only part of the set of normalised positive linear functionals of ( the convex hull of ) the set of results ( the latter would be a square circumscribed on the given one ) . ]",
    "thus , with the idea of a ` probability table ' we can very easily implement ` toy theories ' or models like those of spekkens  @xcite and kirkpatrick  @xcite ( cf .  also the issue raised by terno  @xcite ) , which can then be compared to classical or quantum mechanics using a unique , common formalism .",
    "the author would like to thank gunnar  bjrk , ingemar bengtsson , christopher fuchs , lucien hardy , sa ericsson , anders mnsson , and anna for advice , encouragement , and many useful discussions .",
    "it is shown that the ` scalar product formula ' , eq .",
    ", includes also the ` trace rule ' of quantum mechanics ( see also ref .",
    "* sect .  5 ) ) .    a preparation is usually associated in quantum mechanics to a _ density matrix _ @xmath65 , and a intervention result to a _ positive - operator - valued - measure element _",
    "@xmath66 ; both are hermitian operators in a hilbert space of dimension @xmath67 .",
    "the probability of obtaining the result @xmath66 for a given intervention on preparation @xmath65 is given by the trace formula @xmath68 the hermitian operators form a linear space of _ real _ dimension @xmath69 ; one can choose @xmath56 linearly independent hermitian operators @xmath70 as a basis for this linear space .",
    "these can also be chosen ( basically by gram - schmidt orthonormalisation ) to satisfy @xmath71 both @xmath65 and @xmath66 can be written as a linear combination of the basis operators : @xmath72 where the coefficients @xmath73 and @xmath74 are real . using eqs .   and   the trace formula becomes @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are vectors in @xmath78 , q.e.d ."
