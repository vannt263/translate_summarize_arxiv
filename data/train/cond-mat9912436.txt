    "despite the deep structural and physical similarities with the wide family of bi- and tl- based high-@xmath6 compounds , the layered cuprate superconductor bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cuo@xmath1 ( bi-2201 ) has a relatively low critical temperature ( typically less than 13 k ) . on the other hand ,",
    "this is accompanied by a value of the upper critical field @xmath7 which lies within the experimentally accessible range , thus allowing the investigation of the whole @xmath8 phase diagram .",
    "nevertheless , difficulties in growing high - quality single crystals have made this material much less studied than the other cuprates . in this work we present the results of irreversible magnetization measurements , carried out up to the applied magnetic field @xmath9 t and down to @xmath3 mk on a bi-2201 single crystal .",
    "the goal of this work is to extract the irreversibility line @xmath10 and deduce what is the most suitable model to interpret its behavior , especially in view of the high anisotropy of the material and the influence of flux motion in the resistive transitions in magnetic field .",
    "the investigated sample is a high - quality bi@xmath11sr@xmath12cu@xmath13o@xmath14 single crystal of approximate size @xmath15 @xmath16m@xmath17 , intrinsically overdoped because of the bi excess localized on the sr positions ; accordingly , we found a critical temperature @xmath18 k. the magnetization was detected by means of a very sensitive capacitive torquemeter , installed into the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator .",
    "the plane of the torquemeter was tilted in order to have an angle @xmath19 between the @xmath20-axis of the sample and the direction of the applied magnetic field .",
    "the torque loops @xmath21 ( inset of fig .",
    "1 ) were recorded during two independent sets of experiments , sweeping the field at the rates @xmath22 mt / s and @xmath23 mt / s , respectively .",
    "the magnetization loops @xmath24 can be obtained from the relationship @xmath25 . calling @xmath26 the applied field corresponding to the vanishing of the irreversible torque , the actual irreversibility field @xmath27 that would be obtained for @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 ; this is due to the high anisotropy of bi-2201 , implying that only the field orthogonal to the @xmath30-planes is effective .",
    "( solid line ) .",
    "the inset shows that all the torque loops have a typical shape that only scales with temperature.,width=283 ]",
    "the irreversibility line @xmath10 obtained in this way is shown in fig . 1 : qualitatively , it is very similar to the resistive upper critical field recently obtained with crystals very similar to ours @xcite , provided that the criterion @xmath31 ( i.e. the `` foot '' of the resistive transition ) is chosen .",
    "this confirms that , in very anisotropic superconductors , there is a wide area of the @xmath8 phase diagram where the resistive transition is influenced by flux motion . on the other hand , this @xmath10 can not be interpreted in a simple depinning or flux creep picture , since its curvature does not correspond to a law @xmath32 with @xmath33 . here",
    "we show that the flux motion above @xmath27 takes place as a consequence of the melting of a 3d - anisotropic flux lattice , as demonstrated by the very good fit ( solid line in fig .",
    "1 ) provided by the analytical form of the 3d - melting line @xmath34 as calculated from the lindemann criterion @xcite :      where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the lindemann number , @xmath39 is the ginzburg number , @xmath40 is the mass anisotropy , @xmath41 and @xmath42 . with parameters appropriate for bi-2201 , the fit to eq .",
    "( 1 ) yields the very reasonable estimate of @xmath43 , very close to the value @xmath44 predicted for 3d vortex lattice melting in high magnetic field @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to observe that eq .",
    "( 1 ) is obtained using a linear extrapolation of @xmath45 down to @xmath46 , and here it provides a good fit down to @xmath47 : a fully linear behavior of @xmath48 is indeed found in bi-2201 @xcite taking the saturation points of the magnetoresistive transitions .",
    "+ the high anisotropy of bi-2201 might suggest that a more realistic picture for the vortex system is a stack of weakly coupled 2d pancake vortices @xcite . instead",
    ", our data do not agree neither qualitatively nor quantitatively to the predicted existence of a 2d-3d crossover field @xmath49 and a field - independent melting temperature @xmath50 in the @xmath8 phase diagram ; also the almost identical shape of the torque loops at different temperatures ( inset of fig .",
    "1 ) suggests the existence of only one pinning mechanism .",
    "we can also rule out a possible quantum melting of the vortex lattice at low temperatures @xcite , since we do nt find any low-@xmath51 linear features in @xmath10 .",
    "+ in conclusion , we can interpret the irreversibility line of overdoped bi@xmath11sr@xmath12cu@xmath13o@xmath14 as the signature of 3d - anisotropic vortex lattice melting down to @xmath47 .    1 s.i .",
