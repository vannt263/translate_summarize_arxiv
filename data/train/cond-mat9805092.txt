    "the crystalline and amorphous phases of silicon are considered prototypical examples of a tetrahedrally coordinated network in ordered and disordered forms .",
    "each phase has been intensively studied experimentally and theoretically , and both are used in a very broad spectrum of electronic applications .",
    "currently all si integrated circuits employ several ion implantation steps in their fabrication .",
    "regions that receive a sufficiently high implantation dose become amorphous within approximately 100 nm of the free surface ; the crystal structure is restored by an interface - mediated crystallization process called solid - phase epitaxial growth ( speg ) . while much is known about the structure of the crystal and amorphous phases individually , considerably less direct information is available about the structure of the interface between them . in light of the importance of speg , and of the intrinsic interest of interfacial phenomena ,",
    "a detailed atomistic study of the amorphous - crystal interface in si is appropriate .",
    "the inaccessibility of the interface atomic structure by experimental probes leaves as the only alternative realistic simulations of this system . in this paper",
    "we discuss such simulations and the insight they provide into the atomic structure and dynamics at the amorphous - crystal interface in si .",
    "there are two major obstacles in simulating this interface : first , a relatively large number of atoms must be included in the simulation to ensure that the character of the two phases is represented accurately ; second , extensive exploration of configuration space is required to ensure that the system is not locked in some small ( and potentially not representative ) region of the accessible configuration space .",
    "ideally one would like to simulate this system by means of unbiased , parameter - free quantum mechanical calculations ( such as density funtional theory in the local density approximation - dft / lda ) , but both the size of systems that can be handled and the extent of configuration space that can be explored through such calculations are severely restricted .",
    "past efforts have either used hand - built models@xcite , computer relaxed geometrical models@xcite , or molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations based on empirical interatomic potentials@xcite .    here",
    "we combine the use of the stillinger - weber empirical interatomic potential and a recently developed semi - empirical quantum mechanical technique , based on a nonorthogonal tight - binding ( tb ) hamiltonian which was parametrized to represent accurately a wide range of bulk and surface structures of si  @xcite .",
    "the use of the empirical potential was motivated by the fact that it affords fast but less accurate calculations for parts of the simulation where maintaining high accuracy is not important ; specifically it used to bring the system from a high - temperature , liquid - crystal interface far from equilibrium , to a low temperature amorphous - crystal interface near equilibrium .",
    "once the system is close to equilibrium , we switch to the tb model which can handle reasonably large systems and is sufficiently fast to allow exploration of configuration space , while maintaining the basic quantum mechanical treatment of electronic degrees of freedom . as such , it is superior to empirical interactions which are considerably more restricted in their ability to describe large structural distortions and the breaking and formation of covalent bonds .",
    "the results of the tight - binding studies can also be used as starting points for more elaborate parameter - free quantum mechanical calculations , although we anticipate that the essential features will remain unchanged .",
    "we use constant temperature , constant stress md to prepare the amorphous - crystal interface samples starting with a liquid - crystal interface as described below . because of the large time scale necessary to create reasonably equilibrated amorphous samples , the use of the tight - binding hamiltonian to compute the interatomic forces while the system is very far from its equilibrium state is impractical , and indeed not beneficial .",
    "instead we use the stillinger - weber interatomic potential@xcite to bring the system reasonably close to equilibrium and only then turn on the tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "the equations of motion are integrated with a gear predictor - corrector algorithm@xcite with a time step of 1  fs .",
    "the temperature is kept constant using a velocity rescaling algorithm where the atomic velocities are uniformly scaled to give the desired temperature once every 500 time steps .",
    "zero stress is maintained with an extended system parrinello - rahman approach@xcite .",
    "the simulation cell includes 320 atoms in a @xmath4\\times[2\\bar{2}0]\\times[005]$ ] box with periodic boundary conditions in all three directions .",
    "the interface lies in the @xmath5 plane , with the @xmath4 $ ] and @xmath6 $ ] vectors forming its sides ( in the following the @xmath7 $ ] direction is referred to as the @xmath8-axis ) . to create the interface ,",
    "we maintain a portion of the simulation cell in the crystalline phase by keeping it below the melting point , while melting and then quenching the remainder of the cell .",
    "the crystalline region includes 128 atoms ( 8 monolayers ) which are kept at 100  k , and the remaining 192 atoms ( 12 monolayers ) form the amorphous region .",
    "the amorphous region is produced by cooling a molten region from 5000  k to 1000  k , using the method of luedtke and landman@xcite .",
    "a total of six samples , cooled to 100  k and equilibrated with the stillinger - weber potential , were relaxed using a conjugate - gradient algorithm with the tight - binding hamiltonian to calculate forces and stresses .",
    "the relaxed samples were used in the analysis of interface features .",
    "a typical sample is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sample ] .",
    "standard measures for characterizing the structure of the bulk phases are the radial pair correlation @xmath9 and bond - angle distribution @xmath10 functions .",
    "these are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pc_bad ] averaged over all six samples . for the amorphous regions ( those that were thermally cycled ) , the functions were computed from samples where the atoms in the crystal regions ( those that were kept cold ) were removed , but using the original periodic boundary conditions . for the crystal regions the atoms in the amorphous regions were removed . because of the missing neighbors at the edges of each region the normalization for the curves is non - standard , although the overall shape is not affected .",
    "the pair correlation functions exhibit the expected features : averages over atoms in the `` crystalline '' regions show distinct order at all ranges allowed by the size of the simulation cell ; averages over atoms in the amorphous regions show distinct first and second neighbor peaks , but no order at longer range .",
    "in particular , they do not have a third neighbor peak , a feature also seen in dft / lda simulations  @xcite and in experiment  @xcite . in the following , the position of the minimum between the first two peaks of the pair correlation function ( @xmath11   ) is used as the criterion for defining the neighbors of an atom in the amorphous regions .",
    "the mean bond angles are @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the crystalline and amorphous regions , close to the ideal tetrahedral angle of @xmath14 .",
    "coordination statistics and ring statistics based on the same nearest - neighbor criterion are listed in table  [ table : bulk_stats ] .",
    "the coordination of the atoms in the crystalline region is nearly perfect ; in the amorphous region there is a significant number of defects , with over - coordinated atoms predominating .",
    "there is also a significant number of minimal rings ( computed using shortest path analysis  @xcite ) with size other than six , including a few eight - membered rings . in agreement with the results of dft / lda md simulations by stich _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , we also observed more 5-membered than 7-membered rings .",
    "the total ring statistics indicate more even - membered rings than the random bond switching model of wooten _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and fewer odd - membered rings .",
    "the characterization of the interface is somewhat more demanding . in order to identify the interface region and to characterize its features we define three different quantities .",
    "the first of these is the rms deviation of the bond angles from the ideal tetrahedral angle @xmath15 .",
    "the bond angle deviation for each atom vs. its @xmath8-coordinate , averaged over all samples and smoothed by averaging over a thickness @xmath16   , is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : local_order ]  ( a ) . although the differences between the crystal and amorphous regions are small ( due to the strong angular forces in silicon ) , a @xmath17    thick transition region associated with the interface is clearly visible between @xmath18    and @xmath19   , and between @xmath20    and @xmath21   .",
    "this observation is in contrast to results of spaepen  @xcite from an analysis of a hand built model for a @xmath22 interface relaxed with a keating potential that shows a larger bond angle deviation at the interface than at either of the adjacent phases .",
    "a second quantity we define to characterize the interface is the sum of the vectors pointing from an atom to its nearest neighbors .",
    "this vector quantifies the asymmetry of the atomic environment .",
    "for example , if an atom is missing one of its neighbors while retaining @xmath23 bonding , this vector will point away from the missing atom .",
    "we refer to this vector as the `` tetrahedral vector , '' @xmath24 . because of the difficulty of plotting vector quantities , the magnitude of @xmath24 vs. the @xmath8-position of each atom is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : local_order ] ( b ) , averaged over all samples and smoothed as described earlier .",
    "the differences betweeen the crystalline and amorphous regions are again small but distinct .",
    "the extent of the interface using @xmath24 is very similar to that indicated by @xmath15 . in the interface region ,",
    "both @xmath15 and @xmath24 vary monotonically between the values in the amorphous and the crystal regions .",
    "the definition of the vector sum becomes more useful when its values and directions at individual interface atoms are considered : these indicate the direction and amount by which a given atom ( or one of its neighbors ) should move in order to create an environment closer to the crystalline state .",
    "a third local quantity we employed to characterize the interface region is the volume of the voronoi polyhedron associated with each atom @xmath25 , plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : local_order ] ( c ) , averaged over all samples and smoothed as described earlier .",
    "this quantity gives a local measure of the density , as well as an estimate of the free volume around each atom .",
    "@xmath25 is about 19.0  @xmath26 in the crystal , which corresponds to a 3.5% compression of the unstrained bulk crystal volume . in the amorphous region",
    "@xmath25 ranges from 20.0  @xmath26 to 20.5  @xmath26 , i.e. the amorphous phase is a few percent less dense than the crystal . to determine the variation of the strain with position and direction ,",
    "we calculated the mean nearest neighbor spacing projected along the in - plane axes , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and the perpendicular axis , @xmath8 . in the crystalline region",
    "the @xmath27 and @xmath28 spacings are 7% smaller than the spacing along the perpedicular direction , indicating that the crystal is under biaxial compression . in the amorphous region the @xmath27 and @xmath28 spacings are 3% larger than in the perpendicular direction , indicating that the amorphous is under biaxial tension . because the two adjacent phases are in opposite strain states , it is impossible to resolve the sign or magnitude of the interface stress .    for a better understanding of the structure of the amorphous - crystal interface we created slices of the samples parallel to the interface .",
    "perspective views of these slices reveal some interesting characteristics : fig .",
    "[ fig : pic_interface ] is an example where the prominent features of the crystalline portion are chains of atoms along the @xmath29 $ ] direction , with very few defects .",
    "the atoms that are not in ideal positions form dimers , where pairs of atoms on adjacent @xmath29 $ ] chains have come close together to form a bond , a feature which was also seen in the hand - built model of saito and ohdomari  @xcite .",
    "one example of this defect is seen on the left side of the image in fig .",
    "[ fig : pic_interface ] ( between the two vertical @xmath29 $ ] chains ) .",
    "this feature is very similar to the well known si(001 ) @xmath30 free surface reconstruction , although in the present case the atoms participating in the dimer have four bonds ( each with two more neighbors on the crystalline side and one more neighbor on the amorphous side ) . on the amorphous side of the interface , some atoms are beginning to assume positions compatible with the crystal lattice .",
    "they line up in chains along @xmath29 $ ] directions ( center of image in fig .",
    "[ fig : pic_interface ] ) , as would be expected for the next layer in the crystal .",
    "the remaining atoms are arranged in more disordered configurations .",
    "one important quantity that characterizes the interface is the interfacial tension @xmath31 , which is , for a single - component system , the excess free energy per unit area .",
    "this excess is responsible for the barrier to nucleation of the crystal in the middle of the amorphous phase ; typically the interfacial tension is determined experimentally by interpreting nucleation rate measurements under conditions where heterogneous nucleation is believed to be insignificant . because it is difficult to ensure that this condition has been achieved , experimental values for the interfacial tension , such as those estimated by tsao and peercy  @xcite or yang  @xcite , represent a lower limit on the true value of the interfacial tension . at sufficiently low temperatures",
    "the entropic contribution to the interfacial tension can be neglected and @xmath31 can be approximated by the excess interfacial energy per unit area @xmath32 , which is easier to determine theoretically .",
    "mathematically , @xmath32 is defined as the excess energy of a system with an interface over the weighted sum of the energies of the two constituent phases , @xmath33 @xmath34 is the total cohesive energy of the sample with the interface , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the cohesive energies per atom of the reference crystal and amorphous states , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the number of atoms in the crystalline and amorphous phases , respectively , and @xmath39 is the total area of the interface",
    ". an analogous equation to eq .",
    "( [ eq : epsilon_ac ] ) for @xmath31 can be obtained by replacing @xmath40 and @xmath41 by the corresponding free energies of these phases per atom , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "when the system is in equilibrium , the assignment of atoms to the individual phases ( i.e. , the determination of @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) is unnecessary because , by definition , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are equal in equilibrium . for the silicon amorphous - crystal interface , even when @xmath31 can be approximated by @xmath32 ,",
    "the determination of @xmath44 and @xmath45 is necessary because the two phases are not in equilibrium with each other .",
    "hence we must determine which atoms should be considered `` crystalline '' and which `` amorphous . ''    to do that we visualize slices of our samples parallel to the interface and label as crystalline any atoms that are bonded to two atoms that were kept frozen or two other atoms that are labelled as crystalline by this procedure , provided that the two atoms would share a common neighbor in the perfect crystal .",
    "this ensures that all the atoms that are considered part of the crystal are in a nearly ideal crystal environment on at least one side , and all are members of six - fold rings that are contained in the crystal . because the calculated interface energy is sensitive to the number of crystal atoms we need to employ a more rigorous definition of the bond between atoms than the one used earlier , which relied simply on distance ( atoms closer than 2.7    were considered bonded ) .",
    "to this end , we consider atoms bonded only if the tight - binding charge density half way between them is above a threshold value which is obtained by using representative @xmath46 and @xmath47 orbitals attached to each atom .",
    "typically , between 10 and 20 pairs of neigboring atoms ( out of about 650 pairs in each sample ) have charge densities that fall below this threshold and are not considered to be bonded to each other , even though their distance is shorter than 2.7   .    a second complication in using our tight - binding hamiltonian to compute the interface energy is the precise value of @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the reference crystal state is an uncompressed diamond lattice ( the compression energy is negligible ) , trivial to generate and its cohesive energy @xmath35 is easy to compute . to compute an appropriate reference amorphous state from which @xmath36 can be estimated",
    ", we take each interface sample and apply the same procedure we used to create the amorphous portion , but this time keeping a 4.75    slab centered in the middle of the amorphous portion frozen . in this way",
    ", we turn the entire sample amorphous .",
    "each bulk amorphous sample is then relaxed with the tight - binding hamiltonian , and used as the reference state when computing the interface energy for the corresponding interface sample .",
    "the resulting bulk amorphous samples have cohesive energies @xmath36 between 4.519 and 4.536  ev / atom , corresponding to an excess energy for the amorphous phase @xmath48 of 0.17 to 0.19  ev / atom .",
    "these values are a factor of two higher than an experimental value for @xmath48 of 0.097  ev / atom , as extrapolated to 0  k from donovan s measurement  @xcite at 960k using the specific heat listed in that work .",
    "the resulting interface energies @xmath31 range from 0.39 to 0.54  j / m@xmath3 for the six different samples , with a mean of 0.49  j / m@xmath3 and a standard deviation of 0.05  j / m@xmath3 . the scatter is due to several factors .",
    "the total energy of the two interfaces in each sample is a small number ( about 15  ev ) computed by subtracting large numbers ( total energies for the interface and reference states , each of order 1500  ev ) .",
    "scatter of 0.3% in the total energy of the interface samples or reference amorphous samples ( which is inevitable due to their disordered nature and small size of the systems ) causes a scatter of 30% in the computed interface energy . partitioning the atoms into crystalline and amorphous parts",
    "also involves an error of about two or three atoms per interface , arising from both the threshold charge density value for considering two neighboring atoms bonded and from errors made in the manual counting process .",
    "there is also a potentially larger source of error in the arbitrary definition of what is required for an atom to be considered `` crystalline . ''",
    "some other criteria we considered , using the values of different measures of order to distinguish between `` crystalline '' and `` amorphous '' atoms , gave values for @xmath37 that differed by as many as tens of atoms from the topological criterion described previously .    the only previous attempt to compute the interface energy through simulation we are aware of is spaepen s work  @xcite using a keating potential to evaluate the energy of each atom in a hand built model of a @xmath22 interface ; the computed interface energy was 0.31  j / m@xmath3 . saito and ohdomari  @xcite also computed the keating potential energy as a function of distance from the interface , although they did not publish a corresponding interface energy . using their plot of the excess energy , and considering their `` original surface '' as a part of the crystal , we compute an interface energy of 0.23  j / m@xmath3 .",
    "these values are consistent with our calculation considering the substantial differences in interface geometry and computational methods .",
    "the most recent experimental measurement of the amorphous - crystal interface tension for silicon we are aware of is by yang  @xcite : an interface tension of 0.48  j / m@xmath3 was obtained by fitting a physically motivated kinetic model to the observed nucleation rate of crystals during ion - beam enhanced crystallization of an amorphous sample .",
    "the agreement of this value with our calcalution is excellent , but probably fortuitous .",
    "the only other experimental result we are aware of is the work by tsao and peercy  @xcite .",
    "they deduced an interface tension of 0.04  j / m@xmath3 from kster s nucleation rate measurements for amorphous thin films  @xcite , where the nucleation is unlikely to be homogenous , and is therefore not a reflection of the true interface tension .",
    "using a combination of interatomic potentials and a specially optimized nonorthogonal tight - binding hamiltonian we have created amorphous - crystal interfaces in silicon by performing melt and quench numerical experiments .",
    "the interfaces are about 7    thick .",
    "all measures of order we considered interpolated smoothly between the crystalline and amorphous values .",
    "slices of the sample along the interface reveal features analogous to dimers on the si(001 ) surface and short crystal - like chains in the amorphous layer adjacent to the crystal . by comparing the energies of samples with and without interfaces we compute an interface energy of about 0.49  j / m@xmath3 , in good agreement with experimental evidence and other theoretical work .",
