    "one of the most exciting results from the first year of operations of nasa s _ swift _  satellite mission @xcite has been the discovery and observation of grb050904 @xcite at redshift @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this burst was initially detected by the _",
    "bat at 01:51:44 ut on september 4 , 2005 , and was quickly followed up by pointed observations with the  telescope ( xrt ) and uv / optical telescope on _ swift _ , and by numerous ground - based facilities .",
    "early afterglow photometry provided the first indications for a very high redshift for this event , @xmath4 @xcite , prompting a global observing campaign that culminated in the spectroscopic observations by subaru that provided the redshift @xcite and enabled the first investigation of the reionization epoch via grb afterglow light @xcite .    within a day of the burst ,",
    "the discovery of an associated prompt @xmath5mag optical / nir flash was reported @xcite .",
    "the timing of this flare , which peaks at @xmath1s after the burst , is coincident with  ( xrt ) and @xmath6-ray ( bat ) flares observed by _ swift",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "this is the second such bright optical flash observed so far , after grb990123 @xcite , and may even exceed that event in optical luminosity @xcite .",
    "subsequent optical and nir observations of the fading afterglow were reported by @xcite and @xcite , and provide evidence for a slow decay phase during the first day after the burst , and a jet break at @xmath7days .",
    "a campaign of radio observations at the vla yielded multiple detections of the afterglow at 8ghz , which exhibited a slow evolution consistent with a high circumburst density and extremely high kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "the  lightcurve observed by _ swift _",
    "exhibits numerous interesting features , including the early flare at @xmath1s , vigorous  flaring activity , and a possible jet break @xcite .",
    "finally , observations with the _ hubble space telescope _  and",
    "the _ spitzer space telescope _  by @xcite have yielded late - time detections of the afterglow and host galaxy .",
    "studies of grbs at low - redshift , @xmath8 @xcite , have established that the circumburst densities for these events range between @xmath9 and @xmath10 , with their kinetic energies having a relatively narrow distribution with a peak around @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to investigate whether the quantities for the high - redshift grbs follow these results or not .",
    "several questions seem particularly pertinent .",
    "what density range is found in the environments of grbs at high redshift ? how do their kinetic energies compare to those of low - redshift events ?",
    "are other properties of high - redshift grbs  their beaming angles and shock microphysical parameters  the same as for low - redshift grbs ?",
    "the answers to these questions can potentially cast light on outstanding mysteries of the grbs themselves , and reveal important aspects of the early universe .",
    "these interesting questions provide the motivation for our detailed investigation of the properties of grb050904 .    in this paper , we attempt a complete model of the full set of , optical / nir , and radio afterglow observations of grb050904 .",
    "our derivation of physical parameters from afterglow observations is carried out in the context of the fireball model ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "we make explicit consideration of two scenarios for the origin of the  and optical flares at @xmath1s .",
    "our first scenario ( a ) attributes the flares to internal shocks or engine activity , and excludes the flares from afterglow fits , with only later observations considered .",
    "this is consistent with the approach of @xcite , who argued on the basis of the fast decay of the flares that they could not be due to reverse shock emission . in our alternate scenario ( b ) , however , we attribute the flares to emission from the reverse shock . in order to accommodate their fast decay , we use a starting time for the asymptotic blandford - mckee solution which is near the start of the flare , later than the burst trigger time , which serves to flatten the post - flare decay . in this scenario",
    ", the optical flare comes from synchrotron radiation in the reverse shock , and the and @xmath6-ray flares are produced by synchrotron self - compton scattering ( ssc ) of photons in the reverse shock region .",
    "a cosmology where @xmath12 is assumed in calculating the luminosity distance @xmath13 . for grb050904 at @xmath0 , the luminosity distance is @xmath14 cm .    our model and its supporting analytical formulae",
    "are presented in ",

    "our numerical simulation procedure and the data set used in our fits are described in  [ sec : numsim ] , while in  [ sec : analysisres ] we analyze the results , including the @xmath15-band light curve (  [ sec : earlyag ] ) , the radio light curve (  [ sec : radio_light ] ) , and our ultimate energy and density constraints (  [ sec : energy_density ] ) .",
    "a discussion of the results and our conclusions are presented in ",
    "[ sec : disc ] and  [ sec : conclusions ] , respectively .",
    "the _ swift _  bat observations of the prompt emission give a @xmath6-ray duration of @xmath16 s , a spectrum with power - law photon index @xmath17 , and a fluence of @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "given the burst redshift of @xmath19 , the isotropic - equivalent gamma - ray energy is @xmath20 .",
    "xrt observations began 161s after the burst and continued for 10  days after the burst trigger , overlapping with bat observations for about 300s before the high energy emission faded below the bat threshold @xcite .",
    "thanks to the _ swift _  prompt alert , the early afterglow was also observed promptly by the tarot robotic telescope .",
    "the tarot observations started at 86s after trigger and lasted for more than 1500s ; by making a spectrophotometric calibration of the field , boer et al .",
    "( 2006 ) are able to present their data as flux densities at 9500  , which we use and shall refer to as the tarot @xmath21-band observations .",
    "other larger ground - based telescopes started imaging the field 3  hours later @xcite .",
    "we present our compilation of the observational data in the  ( xrt ) , hard ( bat ) , and optical / nir in fig .",
    "[ fig : all_the_data ] .",
    "here and throughout the paper we convert  measurements to flux density measurements at the frequencies of 5  kev ( xrt ) or 50  kev ( bat ) ; these energies correspond to observing frequencies of @xmath22hz ( xrt ) and @xmath23hz ( bat ) , respectively .",
    "the conversion factors from photon counts per second ( cps ) to flux are 3.31 @xmath24 for xrt pc data , 1.82 @xmath24 for xrt wt data , 154.6 @xmath24 and 86.2 @xmath24 for bat masktag - lc data , respectively ( see @xcite  @xcite for the details of xrt pc , wt and bat data ) .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : all_the_data ] , the flux and spectral evolution of the burst and afterglow divide the lightcurve into six distinct segments , determined by inspection and motivated by the physical model put forth herein .",
    "these segments are : ( a ) @xmath25 seconds : in the  band , the flux decays as @xmath26 with an index of @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "we follow the conventional definition for the flux @xmath28 . in the @xmath21-band observation , there are two observational data points , the earlier of which is only an upper limit , apparently indicating an increasing tendency of the flux with time .",
    "( b ) @xmath29 seconds : flares are observed in both the @xmath21 and  bands , and also in the bat energy range .",
    "they peak around 470 seconds after the burst trigger time .",
    "the spectral index evolves from @xmath30 to @xmath31 over this time interval .",
    "( c ) @xmath32 seconds : a power - law decay is shown in the  band . during the same time interval , there is no optical / nir detection , except for two upper limit flux values at 9500 @xmath33 .",
    "( d ) @xmath34 seconds : many irregular fluctuations are observed in the  band .",
    "the j band shows a decay which can be described with @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "( e ) 0.5 days @xmath36 days : there is no effective xrt observation within this period , and no further fluctuations are detected .",
    "the flux in the j band is flattened a little bit with a temporal index of @xmath37 @xcite or @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "( f ) @xmath39 days : the flux decay index in j band is around @xmath40 .",
    "only one data point in the  band is available .",
    "the j - band data shows a sharp break , which is thought to be the jet break .",
    "thanks to the rapid and precise alerts generated by _ swift _ , and its extensive multiwavelength follow - up campaigns ,",
    "the afterglow data collected during the _ swift _  era has resulted in some necessary modifications to the standard afterglow model .",
    "data from _ swift _  have provided the greatest advance over earlier datasets in the  band , as _ swift _  responds to the burst orders of magnitudes faster than previous generations of satellites and can often track the  afterglow for up to 10 days .",
    "many new features of the  afterglow have thus emerged , leading to the identification of a canonical x - ray afterglow behavior .",
    "in addition to the prompt emission phase , this involves at least five components of the  afterglow ( nousek et al . 2006 ; zhang et al .",
    "2006a ) , which are : ( 1 ) a steep decay phase , often interpreted as the tail of the prompt emission , and thus , part of the grb internal shock ; ( 2 ) a shallow decay phase of uncertain origin , with several theoretical models proposed , including energy injection , jet inhomogeneities , or varying shock microphysical parameters ; ( 3 ) a normal decay phase , familiar from pre-_swift _",
    "observations ; ( 4 ) a post jet break phase ; and ( 5 ) the  flares , which are superposed on the various power - law segments of the afterglow s decay , and are fast - evolving in the sense that the flare s rise and decay timescales @xmath41 are much smaller than the time since the burst @xmath42 , that is , @xmath43 .",
    "the current interpretation ascribes the  flares to the same cause as the prompt gamma - ray emission  energy dissipation in internal shocks @xcite .",
    "since the  flares are thus a manifestation of central engine activity , it is necessary to exclude them from afterglow model fits ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the accumulation of _ swift _  afterglow observations has also raised questions about the collimated or `` jet '' interpretation of afterglow lightcurves .",
    "traditionally , jets have been invoked to explain a late time ( @xmath44day ) , broadband and achromatic steepening in the afterglow decay by an increment of + 1 in the power - law index , from @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "specifically , the late - time decay index is predicted on robust grounds to be @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the power - law index of the energy distribution of the synchrotron - emitting electrons that generate the afterglow light .",
    "current challenges to the jet break picture are two - fold .",
    "first , there are few jet breaks seen in the  light curves of afterglows observed by _ swift",
    "_  @xcite . as of 7 october 2006 ,",
    "the xrt had observed 145 long grbs and 16 short grbs , with the  afterglows of almost all long bursts followed for days to weeks with _ swift _ , in campaigns that typically last until 10 days after the burst .",
    "unexpectedly , among these bursts , only 4 long bursts and 2 short bursts show the jet break signature ( see table 1 , * ? ? ?",
    "second , where  breaks of the appropriate steepness are seen , they are often observed to be chromatic , exhibiting a different evolution in uvot ( or ground - based optical ) observations . thus the jet break picture is being reevaluated , with new possibilities , such as energy injection or the evolution of microphysical shock parameters , under active consideration @xcite .    despite these results",
    ", we believe that the jet break picture remains the better interpretation for most bursts , even in the _ swift _  era .",
    "first , the energetics of grbs are extremely difficult to reproduce from stellar - mass progenitors without beaming corrections of some sort .",
    "second , the successes of the standard jet break picture in modeling bursts from before _ swift _",
    "are too numerous and significant to be discounted ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "third , several candidate jet breaks have been identified in the _ swift _  era , and when these are seen , they exhibit the expected properties ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "finally , several arguments support the presence of a jet break in the evolution of the afterglow of interest to us here , grb050904 .",
    "the break that is observed in the nir lightcurve of the afterglow at @xmath49 day @xcite is achromatic , being seen in multiple nir bands , and is followed by a steep post - break decay with power - law index @xmath50 , consistent with the closure relation expected from the standard jet model @xcite . separately , combining the ghirlanda relation @xcite , and expression for the jet break time @xcite , a jet break is expected in the range between 0.64 and 3.0 days .",
    "the peak energy of grb050904 is @xmath51 kev and its isotropic - equivalent gamma - ray energy lies between @xmath52 and @xmath53 erg @xcite , so we take @xmath54 kev and @xmath55 100 . in addition , the circumburst density lies between @xmath56 @xcite . setting @xmath57 and the radiation efficiency in the prompt emission phase @xmath58",
    ", one can obtain the jet break ranges of 0.64 and 3.0 days from eqn .",
    "3 of @xcite , which is consistent with the observed break time .",
    "it has been argued by @xcite that the flares at @xmath1s are due to internal shocks , rather than a reverse shock , based on an apparent steep decay of the  light curve right after the peak , with a temporal index of @xmath59 when referenced to the burst trigger time ( see @xcite for a discussion on the onset of grb afterglow ) .",
    "this is because the fastest decay must not be steeper than that from the high latitude emission , whose temporal index is @xmath60 , in this case , @xmath61 .",
    "this leads them to favor internal shocks for both the optical and  flares , or a combination of reverse shock for the optical and internal shocks for the .",
    "consistent with this argument , we investigate a model of the forward - shock emission only , that is , we consider only data points in regions ( c)-(f ) of fig .  1 .      separately , we consider a scenario in which the flares peaking at @xmath1 seconds in the optical and  are due to the reverse shock .",
    "this is motivated by the following argument .",
    "first , from the observational point of view , the flares of grb050904 have a great similarity with the behavior of grb990123 , which is thought to be due to the reverse shock ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "second , the blandford - mckee ( bm ) solution @xcite describing the afterglow is parameterized with a time origin @xmath62 given by the trigger time .",
    "however , the bm solution is an asymptotic description of the afterglow evolution , which is valid for times substantially longer than any of the timescales associated with the prompt emission .",
    "clearly , however , there is a transition from the initial prompt phase , when the bulk lorentz factor is relatively constant , to the steady deceleration phase when the asymptotic bm solution applies .",
    "numerical simulations have so far not provided specific guidance on the most appropriate value of the reference time for bm ( afterglow ) evolution .    naturally , however , the steepness of the light curve decay , as parameterized by @xmath63 , depends on the reference time @xmath62 that is adopted .",
    "this has been discussed most recently in the context of the  flares seen by _ swift _ , which exhibit steep decays and so are widely attributed to internal shocks @xcite .",
    "here we are dealing with a somewhat different situation , in that the  light curve exhibits an initial flare and a subsequent decay , which we propose to attribute to a reverse shock . in the absence of guidance from numerical simulations ,",
    "we adopt a purely phenomenological approach , based on the constraint that , whether for internal shocks or for a reverse external shock , the temporal decay can not be steeper than @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the reference time which fits the high latitude decay @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the spectral index . for late central engine internal shocks , @xmath65 is found to be near the onset of the last spike @xcite . here , in the same spirit , since the initial  flare is assumed to be due to the reverse shock , after which the bm solution is asymptotically reached , the new reference time @xmath65 is determined from the constraint that the decay slope be equal to that expected from the high latitude mechanism .",
    "having set a new reference time @xmath65 , all the time - related quantities for the afterglow evolution , such as @xmath68 and so on , are now referred to @xmath69 .",
    "we emphasize , however , that although the reference time is shifted from the burst trigger time to a new time point , the physical deceleration timescale remains the usual one . for grb050904 ,",
    "the best - fitting reference time satisfying the high latitude condition is @xmath70 , where the ( usual ) deceleration timescale is 468s ( and the latter is measured relative to the burst trigger time ) .    the deceleration time is a critical point in the afterglow evolution .",
    "after that , both the reverse shock and the forward shock evolve into the asymptotic regime of the bm solution . in model ( b ) , the peak time should represent the deceleration time of the shock . in the discussion below all the formulae after the deceleration time are taken relative to new reference time @xmath65 ( we have inserted the exact value of @xmath65 into the equations below ) . a difference between models ( a ) and ( b ) lies in that @xmath71 for model ( a ) and @xmath72 for model ( b ) .",
    "the determination of @xmath65 for model ( b ) will be described in  [ sec : dataconst ] .",
    "the flares in the optical @xcite and  @xcite are observed to peak simultaneously at @xmath1seconds after the burst .",
    "the  data has better time resolution , with an estimated peak time of @xmath73s .",
    "we consider fits for two generic models , as described above . in model ( a ) the flares",
    "are ignored , as they may come from other regions ( possibly internal shocks ) rather than the reverse shock region . in model",
    "( b ) , however , we consider the flares to be due to the reverse shock . in this case , since the peak of the flare is clearly separated from the grb itself , the reverse shock must be in the thin - shell regime @xcite .",
    "spectral analysis @xcite shows that the flares in the  and optical bands must be due to different mechanisms . here",
    ", we assume that the optical flare is due to synchrotron radiation in reverse shock region , and that the flare is produced by synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc)in the reverse shock region ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "other observed components at late times , except for the flares , are assumed to be produced by synchrotron radiation from the forward shock .",
    "we use the following reference values for the main parameters involved : the isotropic - equivalent kinetic energy @xmath74 , the external circumstellar density @xmath75 , and the magnetic field ratio of the reverse and forward shocks @xmath76 .",
    "in addition , we have assumed equality of the energy equipartition parameter for electrons in the forward and reverse shock regions in model ( b ) .    a transition from the temporal index @xmath77 to @xmath50 , interpreted as the jet break ,",
    "is observed at @xmath78  days @xcite , and the sharpness of this break makes the burst not likely to have occurred in a stellar wind - type density environment @xcite .",
    "therefore , we will focus on afterglow evolution in a uniform density environment throughout the paper .",
    "usually the synchrotron emission spectrum of the forward shock is described by a broken power - law with three critical quantities @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 which are the synchrotron frequencies for the electron energies at the injection , cooling and peak flux emission , respectively @xcite . in modeling the radio emission ,",
    "it is necessary to also take into account the self - absorption frequency , @xmath82 .",
    "we present the formulae including self - absorption in appendix [ self_ab ] , because there are different forms depending on various afterglow regimes , six in all , for the spectra given by @xcite .",
    "the main quantities of interest are : @xmath83 where the convention @xmath84 is used , kinetic energy @xmath85  erg , and density @xmath86  .",
    "@xmath87 is the magnetic field equipartition parameter , and @xmath88 is the electron equipartition parameter . the subscript `` @xmath89 '' denotes the forward shock , and `` @xmath90 '' denotes the reverse shock .",
    "the parameter @xmath91 refers to the first - order inverse compton effect and is defined as @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "here @xmath93 , the fraction of the electron energy that is radiated away , expresses the magnitude of the radiative correction : @xmath94 for fast cooling and @xmath95 for slow cooling , where @xmath96 is the cooling lorentz factor and @xmath97 is the typical lorentz factor for the electrons . for @xmath98 , the luminosity distance in a concordance cosmology is @xmath99 cm . after the deceleration time , relative to the new reference time , the afterglow will evolve asymptotically as the bm solution .",
    "thus , the evolution relation for each quantity is @xmath100 , and @xmath101 .",
    "the quoted typical values for @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath102 are consistent with the ones in @xcite , but the values for @xmath79 and @xmath80 are 2 times smaller , and the typical value for @xmath103 is 4 times smaller than that in @xcite , which are fitted for the numerical simulation results .      in the reverse shock at the deceleration time , the typical quantities are @xcite : @xmath104 where @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 is the compton parameter in the reverse shock region , and the factor @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the lorentz factor at deceleration time . for the thin - shell case ,",
    "@xmath110 , so we have @xmath111 @xcite .",
    "after the deceleration time , since the shock is in the thin - shell case , each quantity evolves as @xmath112 where @xmath113 , @xmath114 where @xmath115 , and @xmath116 where @xmath117}$ ] @xcite where @xmath118 is the evolution index for @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the lorentz factor of the afterglow , and @xmath121 is the radius of the afterglow .",
    "both models include inverse compton effects .",
    "the formulae for the normal case @xmath122 and @xmath122 in the forward shock case are listed in @xcite .",
    "we have derived the formulae for additional cases where the self - absorption frequency is above the typical frequency @xmath79 or cooling frequency @xmath80 in appendix [ app : ic ] . for inverse",
    "compton effects in the reverse shock , the self - absorption frequency has a similar form as that of the forward shock , the only difference being that the forward shock - related quantities are replaced by the corresponding reverse - shock quantities .",
    "before the bulk lorentz factor drops below the inverse of the opening half - angle , @xmath123 , each of the typical quantities follows the evolution given above ( see sections [ sec : forsy ] and [ sec : revsy ] ) .",
    "after @xmath124 , those typical quantities follow a different evolution given by @xcite .",
    "we also consider the non - relativistic ( nr ) evolution of the afterglow in its end - state .",
    "the time for the afterglow to enter into the nr stage is calculated by the condition that the lorentz factor of the shell @xmath125 .",
    "after the afterglow evolves into the nr stage , its dynamics are described by the self - similar sedov - von neumann - taylor solution , for which @xcite have given a detailed description .",
    "we have considered the host galaxy extinction in the optical band in the rest frame of the host galaxy , using a milky way extinction curve .",
    "we note that the particular type of extinction curve used is not expected to make a difference in this case ; @xcite have tested the application of smc , lmc , and milky way extinction curves to the composite j - band data , and all three models suggest minimal extinction . in our fitting",
    ", we treat the visual extinction @xmath127 in the host galaxy as a free parameter .",
    "in addition , because the extinction affects the spectral shape , we have considered the spectral index correction due to the host galaxy extinction in our fitting .    besides the normal extinction by the host galaxy , the emission close to the wavelength of lyman-@xmath126 at @xmath0 , including @xmath128 band emission ( effective wavelength @xmath129 and band width is @xmath130 ) , has undergone neutral hydrogen absorption in the igm .",
    "@xcite fit the spectrum of grb050904 and find its best - fit column density to be @xmath131 .",
    "to find the expected lyman-@xmath126 absorption in the @xmath128 band , we have convolved the lyman-@xmath126 absorption profile with the filter transmission curve of the @xmath128-band , and obtain the absorption coefficient @xmath132 meaning @xmath133 loss of @xmath128-band flux .",
    "also we notice that from figure 6 in @xcite , the absorption around wavelength @xmath134 is negligible , so we take the absorption efficient @xmath135 for the 9500    data .",
    "our model fits for the two different scenarios cover a range of bands from the radio , through the ir / optical , to  and bat energies .",
    "the list of the observational data used in our global fitting is in table [ table : alpha - beta ] .    .reverse and forward shock observation data points [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ , > , < \" , ]     [ table : parameter_value ]",
    "the shift of the afterglow starting time to the epoch @xmath136 seconds modifies the analysis and the interpretation of the early afterglow in model ( b ) , but this should not affect the late - time afterglow light curve evolution , which should be similar to the one for model ( a ) .",
    "thus the discussion below will be focused on the light curve of model ( a ) , and where there are differences , these are pointed out .",
    "@xcite have fitted their collection of nir data , and find that between 3  hours and 0.5  days after the burst , the fading of the afterglow can be fitted by a power law of index @xmath137 , while after 0.5 days the fading appears to slow down to a temporal index of @xmath138 . at @xmath139  hours ( 0.44 days )",
    ", the spectral index is @xmath140 .",
    "a single power - law decay is ruled out at 3.7@xmath141 confidence .",
    "@xcite have extended datasets whose observation time reaches up to 7  days after the burst , and fit the lightcurve with a smoothly - broken power law .",
    "the fit gives @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and @xmath144  days .",
    "in addition , the spectral index at @xmath145  days is calculated to be @xmath146 or @xmath147 by two slightly different fitting codes .",
    "thus , based only on the observations in the optical / nir bands , we can divide the light curve into 3 segments : ( d ) @xmath148 : the afterglow decays as a power - law with index of @xmath149 ; ( e ) @xmath150 : the light curve is relatively flat , decaying as a power - law with index @xmath151 ; and ( f ) @xmath152 : the light curve decays with an index of @xmath153 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : all_the_data ] ) .",
    "@xcite have argued that the fast decay during stage ( d ) represents the normal afterglow , and the flattening at stage ( e ) is caused by energy injection .",
    "then the stage ( f ) would indicate a return to the normal afterglow evolution . here , however , we have presented a different interpretation for the stages ( d ) and ( e ) .",
    "the flux at stage ( d ) is considered to be suppressed by the inverse compton interaction between electrons in the forward shock and flare photons , while the flux in stage ( e ) is the normal flux without external inverse compton process .",
    "this is motivated by the argument of @xcite suggesting that the  flare photons can interact with the electrons in the forward shock regions via inverse compton scattering .",
    "the origin of the late - time  flares is unknown , although a widely - held view is that they are due to the internal shocks from late time engine activity .",
    "since these  photons would be coming , in this view , from a region different from ( and behind ) the forward shock , we call this inverse compton ( ic ) process an `` external ic process . '' in this case , the external ic process will contribute significantly to the cooling of the forward shock electrons , since the flare luminosity is much larger than the forward shock ( afterglow ) luminosity , and the compton parameter is determined by the ratio of those two luminosities . if the total radiated energy at a given time is constant , when the energy radiated via the inverse compton process increases , the synchrotron radiation should decrease . in effect , this can be viewed as the synchrotron radiation having been suppressed by the inverse compton process .",
    "since the @xmath15-band luminosity at this time is dominated by synchrotron radiation , the observed flux would become smaller in the presence of strong external ic processes . at the end of the flare ,",

    "if we assume that the averaged luminosity ratio between the flare and the forward shock in the  is @xmath154 ( `` fl '' is the flare and `` f '' denotes the forward shock ) , following the similar definition for the compton parameter which is the ratio of the ic luminosity to the synchrotron luminosity @xmath155 where the subscript `` ssc '' indicates the self - compton scattering process @xcite , we can get the new compton parameter , considering the external ic process , as @xmath156=[(k+1)\\eta \\epsilon_e/\\epsilon_b]^{1/2}$ ] .",

    "we can estimate the required luminosity ratio from the observed suppression factor .",
    "taking the power - law index for the electron energy distribution to be @xmath170 , the theoretically expected temporal index is @xmath171 for @xmath172 , the expected regime for the optical afterglow during stage ( e )",

    "apparently , compared to the mean observed luminosity ratio between the flares and the forward shock , @xmath181 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : all_the_data ] ) , this indicates within our picture that only a small fraction of the flare photons have interacted with the electrons in the afterglow",
    ". a possible explanation could be that the anisotropic distribution of the incoming flare photons in the comoving frame of the afterglow shock @xcite .",
    "this resultsing more head - on scattering which reduces the ic interaction .",
    "therefore , the suppression is relatively small and the optical flux is only affected to a reduce degree .",

    "fig : light_curve_flare ] , we have plotted the reverse shock radio emission as a dotted blue line starting from @xmath183s , while the solid blue line shows the combined radio emission from both the forward shock and the reverse shock ; as can be seen , the emission from the reverse shock is negligible .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : light_curve_flare ] , there is one averaged radio data point centered at @xmath184 seconds and @xmath185 ( indicated with dashed lines ) based on the average of multiple vla observations spanning @xmath186 days ( see fig . 2 of * ?",
    "given the large dynamic range in time , we consider this data point as an upper limit of the radio emission during that period .",
    "we can see that our best - fit radio light curve for the forward shock in both models ( a ) and ( b ) fits accommodates this upper limit reasonably well , along with the other data points .",
    "the density obtained in our fit , @xmath187  for model ( a ) and @xmath188  for model ( b ) , is smaller than the @xmath189  density derived by @xcite .",

    "the radio observations thus provide the best frequency for density constraints , and fail to provide a tight constraint mainly because of the lack of data ( measurements ) late times .    with regards to the circumburst density , we note that @xcite observed the spectrum and detected in it fine structure lines including @xmath190 , which were taken to imply an electron density of up to @xmath191 .",
    "the density obtained from the spectral lines would thus be consistent with our best - fit value for the density , and suggest that the observed lines formed in region similar to that hosting the grb itself .",
    "however , we note that several recent papers @xcite have suggested that these fine - structure transitions in grb afterglows are excited by radiative processes , rather than collisions , which would make the density constraint irrelevant",
    ".    an important check on our model results , pointed out by @xcite , is to estimate the  luminosity from the light curve at some fiducial time ( usually at @xmath192 hours ) . at @xmath193 days , the observed flux over the xrt energy range is @xmath194 .",
    "calculating back to @xmath195 hours for the afterglow flux from synchrotron radiation , the predicted flux is @xmath196 .",

    "even so , there are still several bursts which have a high observed efficiency , for example , @xmath228 for grb 050315 and @xmath229 for grb 050416 @xcite .",
    "the extreme interest in grb050904 has motivated several groups to analyze the burst data and suggest interpretations .",
    "these works fall into two categories : ( 1 ) comparing the properties of grb050904 with other bursts ; and ( 2 ) making fits to the grb050904 data either in the framework of internal shock or external shock models .",
    "we give a brief description below of the work of other groups and mention key differences between their work and ours .    in category ( 1 ) , @xcite made a composite @xmath15-band light curve starting from @xmath230 days to @xmath231 days . after applying extinction correction , they shifted grb050904 as well as lower - redshift bursts to @xmath232 , and made a comparison of afterglow lightcurves .",
    "they found that grb050904 is much brighter than other grbs at early times , but of roughly equal brightness at late times .",
    "thus they conclude that grb050904 most likely is still a normal grb .",
    "the other analyses are all in category ( 2 ) .",
    "@xcite argued that grb050904 is a burst with extremely long central engine activity .",
    "they put all the observed data within the framework of the internal shock model .",
    "by contrast , we only treat the first several hundred seconds ( bat ) as internal shock activity in our model ( corresponding to the stages ( a ) and ( b ) for model ( a ) , and stage ( a ) for model ( b ) in fig .",
    "1 ) . the late - time  flares between @xmath233 and @xmath234 seconds may be due to internal shock , but we have interpreted portions of this  emission as being due to the forward - shock afterglow .",
    "@xcite argued that the @xmath1s flare is from internal shocks on the basis of its fast decay ( the temporal index is @xmath235 relative to the trigger time ) and also because the optical - to-  emission of the flare can not be described by a synchrotron radiation model @xcite .",
    "they made fits to all the available @xmath15-band data .",
    "they argue that the slow - decay portion of the lightcurve is due to energy injection . in our model , besides fitting over all the additional bands (  and radio ) , we propose a new mechanism for the flattening , namely that it is caused by the suppression of the synchrotron radiation by the interaction between the  flare photons and afterglow electrons . separately , in our model ( b ) , we introduced a new reference time @xmath65 which flattens the decay index , and allows us to interpret the @xmath236s optical/  flare as arising in the reverse shock .",
    "@xcite made broadband model fits including the , nir / optical , and radio data .",
    "the difference with our work is partly that we have used the larger data set that later became available .",
    "we have included two  data points as early as @xmath237 seconds , and we also included the @xmath238 band data observed @xmath239 days after the burst @xcite . since most of the other data are concentrated around @xmath240 seconds , the introduction of these additional  and nir data have some impact on the final fitting result .",
    "the other major difference is that we have freed all the possible parameters and applied the mcmc method for the global fitting , making an efficient exploration of the full parameter space , and providing the posterior distributions ( including confidence intervals ) for each parameter .",
    "@xcite argued that the power - law - like decay right after the flare @xmath1s should be interpreted as forward shock emission .",
    "because the extrapolation of the late time  flux to early times is lower than the observed value , they found that a wind - type environment was favored by the closure relationship for this early - time segment ( it should also be noted that their spectral index is smaller than @xcite ) .",
    "they propose a density - jump model for the afterglow evolution : before a certain radius , the density goes as @xmath241 and after that , the density is a constant ism model . at the transition point",
    "a termination shock is formed which lies around @xmath242pc from the central engine . in our model",
    ", we consider the same segment of data , but interpret it differently .",
    "we argue that the flux between 600 and 800 seconds arises from the combination of three sources : high - latitude emission of the prompt emission , flux from the flare , and forward shock emission . reviewing the data closely ,",
    "we see that actually there are two other small flares between 800 and 2000 seconds , so the data around @xmath243 seconds has the contribution from the flares and the forward shock ( see fig .",
    "once we subtract the flare contribution from the observed data , we argue , the forward shock contribution is what remains . and in fact , we find that an extrapolation of the late - time flux to early times is consistent with this flare - subtracted early - time flux",
    ".    there remain some substantial differences in parameter values between the two models that we have presented .",
    "for example , the most likely value for @xmath244 in model ( a ) is roughly @xmath245 , but the most likely value for @xmath244 in model ( b ) is around @xmath246 .",
    "it turns out that the main difference lies in the optical flux at early times .",
    "we take as an example the @xmath15-band light curve for the best fitting parameter set in model ( a ) .",
    "the flux slowly decays with an index of @xmath247 before @xmath248 and then follows a faster decay with a temporal index of @xmath249 after @xmath250 .",
    "the break at @xmath251 seconds is caused by the crossing of the electron s typical frequency @xmath79 through the optical observing frequency .",
    "since we have @xmath252 , then the smaller @xmath244 , the smaller the typical frequency , therefore the earlier the crossing time . the fit in model ( b ) requires an earlier break than in model ( a ) , so a smaller value of @xmath244 is expected in model ( b ) .",
    "since the observed flux from the forward shock is the same in both models , we expect a higher kinetic energy in model ( b ) .",
    "similarly , at the deceleration time , the reverse shock flux is larger than that from the forward shock , so a larger @xmath253 is expected in the reverse shock .",
    "we notice that in both our models we find a small value for @xmath88 , e.g. , the best fitting @xmath254 for model ( a ) and @xmath255 for model ( b ) . considering the radiative correction factor @xmath256 ( where @xmath62 is the deceleration time , and we set @xmath257 seconds for model ( a ) and @xmath258 seconds for model ( b ) ) , that is , the amount by which the kinetic energy at time @xmath42 is reduced by comparison to the kinetic energy at time @xmath62 , we find @xmath259 for model ( a ) and @xmath260 for model ( b ) at @xmath261 seconds after the burst .",
    "therefore , the radiative losses are mild in either case , consistent with our assumption that the afterglow evolves in an adiabatic fashion .",
    "our fitting results also show that the host galaxy dust extinction is quite small , @xmath262 mag or even smaller , consistent with the results from @xcite .",
    "they applied several different dust models ( mw , lmc and smc ) over the composite @xmath15-band , and all the models suggested zero or negligible extinction . in the context of grb990123 , it was suggested that the negligible extinction to the burst was the result of dust destruction by the strong burst and early - afterglow emission @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have performed the most extensive multiband analysis so far of the grb050904 afterglow .",
    "we have considered two scenarios : ( a ) only forward shock emission is considered , and the flares peaking at @xmath263 after the burst are assumed to be due to internal shocks ( or are otherwise independent of the afterglow ) ; and ( b ) the nir and  flares at @xmath1s are ascribed to emission from the reverse shock  when the ejecta has swept up enough material and starts to decelerate , the synchrotron radiation in the reverse shock produces the optical flare , and the self - compton scattering of synchrotron photons generates the flare observed in the xrt and bat energy bands .    combining the early afterglow data with late - time observations in the ,  optical and radio , and using a markov chain monte carlo method , we present a full characterization of the posterior distributions ( including confidence intervals ) for the various parameters of our model fits .",
    "our best - fit parameter values for model ( a ) are @xmath203 , @xmath264 , @xmath201 , @xmath265  , @xmath266 , @xmath267 , and @xmath268mag , with a reduced chi - squared value of @xmath269 .",

    "note that the subscripts @xmath90 and @xmath89 refer to the reverse shock and forward shock respectively , @xmath279 , and we have assumed @xmath280 .",
    "we have compared the density , the geometrically - corrected kinetic energy and the  luminosity at @xmath192  hours derived here for our two models of grb050904 against those values for other bursts , as derived from afterglow modeling .",
    "the results for both models show that although the  luminosity of grb050904 falls within the range for low - redshift grbs , the density and geometrically - corrected kinetic energy are both above the typical values for low - redshift grbs , which suggests that grb050904 may be a member of a distinct population of high - redshift , higher kinetic - energy bursts , whose properties differ from those of low - redshift grbs .",
    "a clear preference between our ( a ) and ( b ) models is hard to establish at present , since there is only one high - redshift grb known .",
    "one would like access to several more high - redshift grb observational datasets before attempting to discriminate between the two models .",

    "also predict that @xmath284 of the _ swift _  grbs originate at @xmath282 .",
    "it appears that one can realistically expect a handful ( 5 to 10 ) of additional high - redshift grb detections with rapid follow - up in the next few years of the _ swift _  mission . in this case",
    ", the consistent application of mcmc methods , as used here , will lead efficiently to a set of statistically well - quantified , posterior parameter distributions and confidence intervals .",
    "this would enable a statistically meaningful comparison of high - redshift and low - redshift grb parameters , which might well lead us to a definite understanding of the physics and environments of grbs as a function of redshift , up to the highest redshifts detected .",

    "<S> apart from its record redshift , the burst is remarkable in two respects : first , it exhibits fast - evolving  and optical flares that peak simultaneously at @xmath1s in the observer frame , and may thus originate in the same emission region ; and second , its afterglow exhibits an accelerated decay in the near - infrared ( nir ) from @xmath2s to @xmath3s after the burst , coincident with repeated and energetic  flaring activity . </S>",
    "<S> we make a complete analysis of available , nir , and radio observations , utilizing afterglow models that incorporate a range of physical effects not previously considered for this or any other grb afterglow , and quantifying our model uncertainties in detail via markov chain monte carlo analysis . in the process </S>",
    "<S> , we explore the possibility that the early optical and  flare is due to synchrotron and inverse compton emission from the reverse shock regions of the outflow . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the period of accelerated decay in the nir may be due to suppression of synchrotron radiation by inverse compton interaction of  flare photons with electrons in the forward shock ; a subsequent interval of slow decay would then be due to a progressive decline in this suppression . </S>",
    "<S> the range of acceptable models demonstrates that the kinetic energy and circumburst density of grb050904 are well above the typical values found for low - redshift grbs . </S>"
