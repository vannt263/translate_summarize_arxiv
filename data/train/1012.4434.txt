    "two - photon interferometry is a rapidly growing field with applications ranging from metrology @xcite and secure communications @xcite to fundamental tests of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "when the two - photon state is produced by parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) @xcite , it is well - known that the coherence properties of the laser pumping the pdc source play an important role .",
    "the original franson interferometer experiments @xcite represent one extreme , where a long coherence - length continuous - wave ( cw ) pump laser is used to produce a pdc photon - pair whose emission time is essentially undefined . in the other extreme , gisin s time - bin entanglement experiments @xcite",
    "utilize a single short pump pulse passing through an unbalanced mach - zehnder ( mz ) interferometer to produce a pdc photon - pair whose emission time is a coherent superposition of two well - defined values .    in this paper",
    "we provide an explicit experimental demonstration of an intermediate regime , where a _ short coherence - length cw pump laser _ is passed through a gisin - type mz pump interferometer .",
    "this produces a pdc photon - pair in a coherent superposition of two time values with a well - defined separation , but an unknown overall starting time .",
    "the coherence generated between two distinct creation times allows a recovery of certain two - photon interference effects that would otherwise be non - existent with a short coherence length cw pump , while the incoherent nature of the possible starting times limits the maximum visibility of these interference effects to @xmath0 .",
    "this work builds on several earlier pdc experiments in which two - photon interference effects originate from the possibility of multiple arrival times of a given pump photon at the pdc source . for example , burlakov _ et.al .",
    "_ used a cw helium - cadmium laser possessing several randomly - phased longitudinal modes which interfere to produce a series of repetitive spikes in the pump photon amplitude @xcite .",
    "similar effects were observed by kwon _ et.al . _ using a low - cost multimode diode laser as a pump @xcite .",
    "other related work involves the coherence between two subsequent pump pulses from a mode - locked laser @xcite , and higher order time - bin entanglement generated by a coherent pulse train @xcite .",
    "a conceptual overview of the experiment is shown in figure 1 .",
    "a pdc source emits photons into opposite ports of a 50/50 beamsplitter in a typical hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) interferometer arrangement @xcite .",
    "the hom interference effect causes both photons to leave in the same output port , which produces a two - photon n00n state @xcite in the output modes .",
    "the outputs of the hom beamsplitter are then recombined at a second 50/50 beamsplitter , thereby forming a pdc mz interferometer of the kind first developed by rarity _ et.al .",
    "_ @xcite . in order to demonstrate the effects of interest here ,",
    "we modify rarity s balanced mz interferometer by including a very large path length imbalance , denoted by @xmath1 in figure 1 .",
    "the value of @xmath1 is chosen to be much greater than the coherence times of pdc photons as well as the pump laser .",
    "the setup is completed by the inclusion of a gisin - type mz pump interferometer , whose path - length imbalance @xmath2 is carefully matched to @xmath1 .",
    "the experiment is conducted by recording the coincidence counting rate between detectors @xmath3 and @xmath4 as a function of the relative phase difference of the interferometers .",
    "typical franson - type or time - bin entanglement experiments require two spatially separated pdc mz interferometers to study nonlocal correlations of distant photons @xcite .",
    "however , many key features of the role of pump coherence in two - photon interferometry can be explored in a less stringent setting using only one common pdc mz interferometer . in many cases",
    ", the use of a single interferometer can simplify the experiments , while still allowing the essential physics to be demonstrated .",
    "this idea has been used in some of the earliest experimental work on two - photon interferometry @xcite .    for our purposes ,",
    "the use of a two - photon n00n state in the single unbalanced pdc mz interferometer of figure 1 simplifies the experimental requirements in two ways .",
    "first , it reduces the number of unbalanced mz interferometers which must be experimentally stabilized and phase - controlled .",
    "second , the photon - bunched form of the n00n state eliminates the need to electronically `` cut - off '' joint detection events corresponding to distinguishable two - photon amplitudes associated with one pdc photon traveling a long path while its twin takes a short path through an unbalanced mz interferometer . for a given pdc source , this effectively doubles the coincidence counting rate compared to the case of two separately seated pdc mz interferometers . as can be seen from figure 1 , when @xmath5 this leaves an output state with exactly four indistinguishable terms contributing to a coincidence count between @xmath3 and @xmath4 at some time @xmath6 :    @xmath7 } |s_{p } ; l_{s}l_{i}\\rangle + \\nonumber \\\\ & & e^{i[\\phi_{o}(t^{\\prime}-\\tau ) + \\phi_{p}]}|l_{p } ; s_{s}s_{i}\\rangle \\ + \\nonumber \\\\ & & e^{i[\\phi_{o}(t^{\\prime } ) ] } |s_{p } ; s_{s}s_{i}\\rangle + \\nonumber \\\\ & & e^{i[\\phi_{o}(t^{\\prime}-2\\tau)+ \\phi_{p } + \\phi]}|l_{p } ; l_{s}l_{i}\\rangle \\ } \\label{eq:4terms}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in this simplified notation , the first ket @xmath8 denotes the pump photon traveling through the short arm of the pump interferometer , while the signal and idler photons of the pdc pair take the long path through the pdc mz interferometer . in analogy ,",
    "the final three kets in equation ( [ eq:4terms ] ) correspond to the three other possible combinations of long and short paths through the two interferometers .",
    "each of the four indistinguishable amplitudes in equation ( [ eq:4terms ] ) has a different relative phase . for simplicity",
    ", we use @xmath9 to represent the relative phase difference of the long vs. short arm in the pump interferometer .",
    "analogously , @xmath10 corresponds to the `` long - short '' relative phase difference in the pdc mz interferometer . in our setup , the phase @xmath10 represents the accumulated relative phase difference of a two - photon n00n state in the pdc mz interferometer , with a period corresponding to the biphoton debroglie wavelength @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath11 describes the initial phase of the pump laser . because we are using a short coherence - length cw pump , the time dependence of @xmath11",
    "plays a particularly important role . for a coincidence detection event at time @xmath6",
    ", we use @xmath12 to denote the value of the pump laser phase at an earlier time @xmath13 , where x is the overall optical path length through the device via the short arms of both mz interferometers .",
    "the first and second terms in equation ( [ eq:4terms ] ) correspond to an overall extra delay of @xmath1 ( eg . propagation through the long arm of only one mz interferometer ) and therefore contain the initial pump phase @xmath14 .",
    "likewise , the fourth term corresponds to propagation through the long arm of both mz interferometers and thus contains the initial pump phase at an even earlier time , @xmath15 .",
    "because @xmath16 is intentionally set to be much greater than the coherence length of the pump laser , the value of @xmath14 will have no definite relation to @xmath12 ( or @xmath15 ) .",
    "consequently , the first and second terms in equation ( [ eq:4terms ] ) can interfere @xcite , but the third and fourth terms provide an incoherent background which limits the visibility of the two - photon interference effects .",
    "it is instructive to use equation ( [ eq:4terms ] ) to compare this intermediate regime of two - photon interferometry using a short coherence - length cw pump , with the extreme cases of gisin s time - bin method using a short pumping pulse and traditional franson interferometry with long coherence - length cw pumps . in the time - bin case",
    ", the use of a single well - defined short pump pulse provides a `` starting clock '' for the experiments @xcite .",
    "this provides timing information which allows the third and fourth terms in equation ( [ eq:4terms ] ) to be easily discarded based on the detector firing times .",
    "the remaining first and second terms in equation ( [ eq:4terms ] ) are indistinguishable in time , and share a common pump - phase regardless of the coherence properties of the pump pulse . in this way",
    ", the use of a pump mz interferometer cleverly induces the required second - order coherence , and 100% visibility two - photon interference effects can be observed with a short pulsed pump @xcite .    on the other extreme , franson - type interferometry without a pump mz results in only two terms , rather than",
    "the four listed in equation ( [ eq:4terms ] ) .",
    "these two terms correspond to both photons taking the long paths ( eg .",
    "@xmath17 ) or both taking the short paths ( eg .",
    "@xmath18 ) through the pdc mz interferometer . in this case",
    "the long - long term has the relevant pump phase @xmath14 , while the short - short term corresponds to the initial pump phase @xmath12 .",
    "however , by using a cw pump with a coherence length much greater than @xmath19 , these two terms remain coherent , and 100% visibility two - photon interference effects can be observed @xcite . in this case , the required second - order coherence originates from the pump laser itself .    in the intermediate regime demonstrated here , the lack of second - order coherence due to the short coherence length of the pump is overcome to some extent by the addition of the pump mz interferometer . for any point in time",
    ", the use of the long and short arms in the pump mz provide two distinct points in the cw pump beam that share a common value of initial pump phase @xmath20 . matching the separation @xmath2 of these two points to the delay @xmath1 in the pdc mz results in the first two indistinguishable two - photon amplitudes in equation ( [ eq:4terms ] ) , in exact analogy to the pulsed time - bin case .",
    "however , the cw nature of the pump precludes the use of a `` starting clock '' to cut - off the remaining two terms which provide an incoherent background .    under otherwise ideal experimental conditions ,",
    "this incoherent background limits the two - photon interference visibility to 50% .",
    "it can be shown that the four - term state in equation ( [ eq:4terms ] ) leads to a coincidence counting rate given by :    @xmath21    where the factor of @xmath22 is the visibility . because the phase shift @xmath10 corresponds to the n00n state debroglie wavelength @xcite",
    ", the coincidence counting rate is expected to show oscillations at the pump wavelength as a function of the relative path lengths in the pdc mz interferometer .",
    "figure 2 shows a schematic diagram of the apparatus we used to implement the scheme of figure 1 .",
    "a cw ultraviolet diode laser beam ( @xmath2340 mw at 407 nm , 0.1 nm linewidth ) was sent through a free - space pump mz comprised of two 50/50 beamsplitters and two mirrors . the pump mz had a path length imbalance of approximately @xmath24 = 60 cm .",
    "the beam coming out of one outport port of the pump mz was coupled into a single - mode pump fiber .",
    "the use of a single - mode pump fiber facilitated alignment of the free - space pump mz interferometer and provided a convenient and robust way to deliver the pump beam to the pdc crystal . due to losses in the pump mz , and a non - ideal transverse mode - shape of the diode laser pump ,",
    "the output of this fiber was typically @xmath2315 mw .",
    "this free - space output was then focused into a 0.7 mm thick bbo crystal with phase - matching considerations oriented for type - i degenerate pdc .",
    "the pdc source produced pairs of horizontally polarized photons at 814 nm , which were coupled into a single - mode 3db fiber coupler ( eg . a 50/50 fiber beamsplitter ) that formed the front - half of a fiber - based pdc mz interferometer .",
    "each arm of the pdc mz contained a fiber - coupled adjustable air - gap optical delay line ( oz optics , model odl 200 ) .",
    "these delay lines had a travel range of 25 mm , and could be used to adjust the relative path lengths in the device .",
    "the back - half of the pdc mz was a formed by a second 3db fiber coupler .",
    "the outputs of the pdc mz were coupled back into free space , and passed through interference filters with a 10 nm fwhm centered at 814 nm .",
    "two single photon detectors and standard coincidence - counting electronics were then used to record the data .",
    "paddle - wheel style fiber polarization controllers ( fpc s ) were used in several locations to control the polarizations in the experiments .",
    "the entire fiber - based pdc mz interferometer was built on a large 0.5 inch thick aluminum plate contained within a heavily insulated box to provide passive thermal stability and minimize phase - drift .    in order to match the 60 cm free - space path length imbalance of the pump mz",
    ", an extra @xmath2340 cm of fiber was added to the long - arm of the fiber - based pdc mz interferometer . to ensure that @xmath1 exactly matched @xmath2 , we temporarily connected the pump mz directly in series with the pdc mz and used an auxiliary broadband `` white - light '' source as the input .",
    "small adjustments to the air - gap delay lines were then made to find first - order interference and match the optical delays in the two interferometers .",
    "as can be seen from equation ( [ eq : ccr ] ) , the coincidence counting rate depends on both @xmath10 and @xmath9 . because we are interested in two - photon interference effects in the pdc mz , it was necessary to ensure that @xmath9 was held stable while @xmath10 was scanned in a controlled way .",
    "we therefore conducted a number of auxiliary tests to verify the stability of the pump mz and the ability to scan @xmath10 .    in practice",
    ", we passively scanned @xmath10 using a thermally - induced phase drift .",
    "as shown in figure 2 , a resistive heating element was used on a small segment ( @xmath23 5 cm ) of fiber in the short - arm of the pdc mz .",
    "we developed a procedure in which the heating element s temperature was raised 4@xmath25 and then quickly turned off . after approximately 20 minutes into the subsequent cooling process , the pdc mz interferometer drifted fairly linearly as a function of time , and went through roughly three 407 nm debroglie periods in about 15 minutes .",
    "the entire free - space pump mz interferometer was kept inside a simple non - insulated hardboard box to minimize air - current and thermal disturbances .",
    "this kept the pump interferometer relatively stable , and there was negligible phase drift in @xmath9 over a time period much longer than the 15 minutes needed to scan @xmath10 through several fringes .        in order to verify the long - term stability of the pump mz",
    ", we used the auxiliary narrowband external - cavity diode laser setup shown in the top part of figure 2 .",
    "the same laser setup could also be used to roughly calibrate the heating procedure used for scanning @xmath10 in the pdc mz interferometer .",
    "the laser ( new focus inc . velocity model 6312 ) had a linewidth @xmath26 300 khz , and a coherence length that greatly exceeded the optical path length imbalance of both the pump and pdc mz interferometers .",
    "as shown in figure 2 , a standard feedback loop based on an absorption measurement in a rubidium vapor cell was used to stabilize the wavelength of the laser .",
    "we typically locked the laser s frequency to within 20 mhz of one of the ground state hyperfine levels of the @xmath4 transition near 780 nm @xcite .",
    "the locking was performed every 25 ms , which was frequent enough to prevent this particular laser from drifting more than @xmath27 wavelengths from a fixed value .",
    "this locking procedure kept any phase - noise due to wavelength drift to a negligible level during our tests .",
    "figure 3 shows results from a typical stability test based on first - order interference measurements in the pump mz interferometer .",
    "a dichroic mirror was temporarily added to inject both the 780 nm laser , as well as the 407 nm pump laser , into the pump mz .",
    "the 780 nm light was monitored by a detector in the lower output port of the pump mz , while the 407 nm light was simultaneously monitored by a detector placed in the output of the single - mode pump fiber . to demonstrate the stability ,",
    "the data shown in figure 3 was recorded just after an intentional disturbance to the pump mz with a heat gun .",
    "the 780 nm signal ( black trace ) shows nearly 100% first - order interference fringes that die out as the effects of the disturbance wear off .",
    "after @xmath23 1 hour , the phase drift is seen to be negligible .",
    "multiple data runs under slightly different conditions showed the same type of behavior , with minimal phase drifts after the interferometer had stabilized . during our main experiments ,",
    "we typically started collecting pdc data after the pump mz box had been sealed for many hours , from which we expect a negligible @xmath9 phase drift over a 15 minute data collection period .",
    "the second data set ( red trace ) shown in figure 3 corresponds to the 407 nm pump signal collected during the same time interval as the 780 nm auxiliary laser signal ( black trace ) .",
    "the key point here was to demonstrate the minimal amount of first - order coherence displayed by the pump laser , as desired for our experiments .",
    "we ensured that the polarizations of the pump laser from both arms of the interferometer were the same , and measured the contribution of the total power coupled into the single - mode pump fiber to be roughly 60% from the short arm , and 40% from the long arm ( this deviated from the ideal 50/50 split due minor deviations in beamsplitter reflectivities and fiber - coupling efficiencies ) .",
    "these conditions predict a maximal visibility of 98% for a long coherence length source , whereas the visibility of the red trace in figure 3 is only roughly 8% for our short coherence - length 407 nm diode pump laser .    although the 60 cm path length imbalance of the pump mz greatly exceeds the expected coherence length of the pump , it is well - known that the output of a cw multimode diode laser can exhibit multiple `` peaks '' separated by a distance 2l , where l is the length of the laser cavity @xcite .",
    "in fact , two - photon interference experiments have been performed where the interference originates from the coherence between these types of recurring peaks @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the two - photon interference effects of interest in our setup should be due to second - order coherence induced by the pump mz , rather than the laser itself @xcite .",
    "consequently , we needed to verify that the 407 nm pump laser exhibited the kind of minimal first - order interference seen in the red trace of figure 3 .",
    "we also performed an auxiliary michelson interferometer test @xcite on our 407 nm laser and found the spacing between the recurring diode laser peaks to be ( @xmath28 ) @xmath29 m .",
    "the path length imbalance of the pump mz therefore corresponds to a separation on the order of 100 peaks .",
    "coherence between these widely spaced peaks is possible , but unlikely to be large due to the finite linewidths of the individual modes in the diode laser @xcite . at the same time , the @xmath2360 cm path length imbalance was not intentionally set to exactly match a whole number of peaks .",
    "we believe that a combination of these two effects nearly eliminated the first - order pump interference in the red trace of figure 3 , as desired .",
    "% visibility .",
    "this indicates a high - fidelity n00n state in the output ports , as desired .",
    "the small shoulders in the data and fit are due to the fact that the 10 nm bandpass filters used in front of the detectors have a transmission profile that slightly deviates from a gaussian shape .",
    ", width=336 ]    the results of our study can be best understood by considering four sequential experimental steps that were used to build up to the final conceptual diagram of figure 1 .",
    "the results of these four steps are shown in figures 4 - 7 .    in the first step ,",
    "the hom interference effects which generate the two - photon n00n state were optimized . to do this",
    ", the pump beam was sent directly into the pump fiber ( and then the pdc crystal ) without passing through a pump mz interferometer .",
    "additionally , the output ports of the first pdc 50/50 beamsplitter were connected directly to the detection channels , rather than serving as the inputs to the pdc mz interferometer . in this way , a standard fiber - based hom interferometer",
    "was temporarily formed @xcite . in our setup",
    ", the relative delays between the two photons impinging on the hom beamsplitter were controlled with translating glass wedges in the free - space paths after the pdc crystal , and fpc s on the input leads of the beamsplitter were used to ensure the polarization states of the pdc photons were the same .",
    "figure 4 shows the results of a typical hom test in our setup .",
    "the data shows a plot of the coincidence count rate as a function of the relative optical delay between the two incident photons , with the expected hom `` dip '' at zero time delay .",
    "the data is best fit by a dip - function with a visibility ( @xmath30)% which signifies that both photons nearly always exit through the same output port of the beamsplitter .",
    "this ensures a high - fidelity two - photon n00n state , which is crucial for our subsequent experiments .",
    "any contamination by terms corresponding to one photon in each output path of this first beamsplitter would lead to unwanted @xmath31 amplitudes which are assumed to be non - existent in our analysis of the full pdc mz interferometer .    in the second step of the procedure",
    ", the outputs of the first 50/50 beamsplitter were reconnected as shown in figure 2 to form the full pdc mz interferometer .",
    "however , the extra 40 cm long fiber was not yet installed in the upper arm , so the two arms of the pdc mz are exactly balanced .",
    "again , the pump mz interferometer was not used . in this configuration ,",
    "our setup essentially reproduced the original two - photon mz interference experiment of rarity et.al .",
    "although we are using a short coherence length cw pump , the fact that the pdc mz is balanced allows 100% visibility debroglie wavelength fringes to be observed in the coincidence counting rate @xcite .",
    "this test allowed us to verify our phase - scanning procedure and estimate the limitations on the visibility due to mode - matching and other technical issues in our apparatus .",
    "% .,width=336 ]    figure 5 shows the results of this test when the relative phase in the balanced pdc mz interferometer was passively scanned using the fiber - heating procedure described in section [ sec : stability test ] .",
    "the data shows the expected sinusoidal variation in the coincidence counting rate as a function of time .",
    "the maximum value points correspond to relative phases differences that are even multiples of @xmath32 , where constructive two - photon interference deterministically splits the two - photon n00n state into exactly one photon in each output port of the pdc mz .",
    "this is simply the time - reverse of the hom effect @xcite .",
    "the slight `` stretching '' of the sinusoidal data in figure 5 is due to the fact that the relative phase drift is not exactly linear with time , as would be expected from passive cooling of the heated - fiber segment during this time interval .",
    "the data is best fit by a sinusoidal function that takes this stretching into account , with a visibility of ( @xmath33)% . this high visibility indicates a good degree of indistinguishability between the interfering two - photon amplitudes , and that phase - instabilities during each 5 second coincidence - collection point are not a significant source of error in our setup .        the third step of the procedure involved repeating the same type of scan shown in figure 5 , but with the extra 40 cm segment of fiber installed in the upper arm of the pdc interferometer .",
    "in this case , the path length imbalance of the pdc interferometer greatly exceeds the coherence length of the pump laser .",
    "consequently , there is no coherence between the @xmath18 and @xmath34 amplitudes , and no two - photon interference is expected @xcite .",
    "figure 6 shows a result of the data accumulated in this configuration under the same scanning procedure used for figure 5 .",
    "it can be easily seen that the high - visibility two - photon interference fringes of figure 5 have completely vanished due to the short coherence - length of the pump laser .",
    "% visibility .",
    ", width=336 ]    the fourth and final step is to partially recover these lost two - photon interference effects by passing the pumping laser through the free - space pump mz interferometer shown in figure 2 , with its path length imbalance set equal to the path length imbalance of the pdc mz ( eg .",
    "@xmath5 ) .",
    "as described in section [ sec : overview ] , the use of the pump mz divides the two interfering two - photon amplitudes into the four indistinguishable amplitudes of equation ( [ eq:4terms ] ) .",
    "two of these four amplitudes are coherent in analogy with pulsed time - bin experiments @xcite , while the two remaining incoherent amplitudes can not be cut - off due to the cw nature of the pump .",
    "this allows a partial recovery of two - photon interference , with a theoretical maximum visibility of 50% given by equation ( [ eq : ccr ] ) .",
    "figure 7 shows the results of this final step when the relative phase @xmath9 of the pump mz was stabilized , and the relative phase @xmath10 of the pdc mz was scanned by the same fiber - heating procedure used in figures 5 and 6 .",
    "the data shows the predicted sinusoidally varying coincidence counting rate , with a best - fit visibility of ( @xmath35)% . the recovered two - photon interference fringes seen in figure 7 represent the primary experimental result of this paper .",
    "note that due to the lack of significant first - order interference in the pump mz interferometer , only half of the original pump laser power is delivered to pump fiber ( and then the pdc crystal ) , while the other half is wasted through the lower output port of the second 50/50 beamsplitter in the pump mz .",
    "consequently , the average coincidence counting rate in figure 7 is roughly half of those seen in figures 5 and 6",
    ". additionally , the apparent debroglie wavelengths in figures 5 and 7 are slightly different because the heating procedure used to implement a phase scan is not actively controlled , and varies slightly from run to run .",
    "furthermore , the 93% visibility of figure 5 obtained with a balanced rarity mz setup @xcite should ideally translate to a 46.5% visibility in the data of figure 7 .",
    "we believe the reduction to 40.8% in the actual experiment is primarily due to alignment sensitivity in the hom effect and pdc mz interferometer , rather than any phase instability in the pump mz interferometer . additionally , the non - ideal 60/40 splitting of the pump mz interferometer led to a visibility loss of only 1% due to a slightly unequal weighting of the interfering @xmath8 and @xmath36 amplitudes in equation ( [ eq:4terms ] ) , and was not a major factor . despite these issues",
    ", the primary results shown in figure 7 clearly demonstrate the expected interference fringes that can be obtained in this intermediate regime of two - photon interferometry with a short coherence - length cw pump laser .",
    "the maximum expected two - photon interference fringe visibility of only 50% , and the use of only a single common pdc mz interferometer ( as opposed to two spatially separated pdc mz interferometers @xcite ) , raises the valid question of classical analogues that could simulate the results of figure 7 @xcite . indeed a single balanced `` pdc mz '' interferometer fed by a variety of simple classical light sources can produce 100% visibility fringes in the product of photodiode signals from its output ports .",
    "the fact that we are essentially using two unbalanced ( but matched ) mz interferometers in series does not fundamentally change the situation , and opens the possibility of classical white - light - type interference effects that can produce results related to figure 7 .",
    "in some sense , the interference effects observed in pdc - based two - photon interferometry originate from the uncertainty in the emission time of the detected photon pair . in the original franson - type experiments @xcite , the use of a narrowband cw pump laser renders the photon pair emission time completely uncertain , while in the gisin - type pulsed time - bin experiments the emission time is confined to two possible well - defined values @xcite . in both cases , however , the fact that the two - photon state is a coherent superposition of the possible emission times allows high - visibility non - classical interference effects to be observed . in this paper , we have described an experimental demonstration of an intermediate situation that shares features of both of these extreme cases .    by passing a short coherence - length cw",
    "pump laser through an unbalanced time - bin - like pump mz interferometer , coherence is created between two possible pair emission times with a well - defined separation , but an unknown overall starting time . as in the pulsed time - bin case ,",
    "this coherence allows two - photon interference effects to be seen in a subsequent unbalanced pdc mz interferometer , regardless of the coherence properties of the pump laser itself @xcite .",
    "however , the cw nature of the pumping beam here precludes the use of the convenient `` starting clock '' available in the pulsed - pump case .",
    "this prevents the ability to cut - off incoherent two - photon amplitudes which limits the visibility to 50% here , as opposed to the 100% visibility that is possible in the pulsed case @xcite .",
    "the observation of these effects was facilitated by using a two - photon n00n state in a single fiber - based unbalanced pdc mz interferometer @xcite . in comparison to more general experiments using two spatially",
