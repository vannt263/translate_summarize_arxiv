    "though the threshold strain ( @xmath29 ) is the lowest for bt strain , the application of nc strain is still practically more feasible than the biaxial strains .",

    "this strong intra - layer hybridization leads to the closing of gap .",
    "this phenomenon can be seen in the band - decomposed charge density fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] ( d ) , where the vbm and cbm show strong in - plane character near s - m transition .    in the case of bt strain , the vbm and the cbm has maximum contribution from mo-@xmath46 orbitals ( fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] ( e ) ) . with the increase in bt strain , mo-@xmath46 and",
    "s-@xmath47 orbitals start to hybridize strongly within the same layer .",
    "this strong hybridization further leads to s - m transition fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] ( f ) .",
    "although in the case of both nc and bt strains , the s - m transition is dominated by mo-@xmath46 and s-@xmath47 , but in the case of nc strain the interaction happens between mo and s atoms from different layers .",
    "however , for bt strain this interaction is within the same layer .",
    "in conclusion , we show the tuning of band gap in multilayer mos@xmath0 under the application of normal as well as biaxial strains . a reversible semiconductor to metal transition",
    "is obtained by applying nc , bc and bt strains .",
    "the nature of the transition in terms of the electronic structure is different in each kind of strain . for a particular strain ,",
    "the reduction in the band gap remains unchanged for different number of layers .",
    "however , the threshold strain at which the transition occurs , increases ( decreases ) with increase in number of layers for normal ( biaxial ) strain .",
    "threshold strain is the least in case of the bt strain and is the maximum for the bc strain . the mechanism behind the s - m transition is also investigated in terms of angular momentum resolved density of states and band - decomposed charge density .",
    "we demonstrate that inter - layer interaction between mo-@xmath46 and s-@xmath48 causes the s - m transition under nc strain .",
    "however , s - m transition under bc and bt strain is caused by the strong hybridization of the intra - plane mo-@xmath45 and s-@xmath49 orbitals and mo-@xmath46 and s-@xmath47 orbitals , respectively .",
    "the change in transport properties of multilayers mos@xmath1 were also investigated under the application of nc , bc , and bt strain for different layer thicknesses .",
    "the strain modifies the dispersion of bands , which improves the thermoelectric performance of the material , significantly .",
    "the thermopower results suggest that under nc strain the efficient thermoelectric performance can be achieved at -0.04 and -0.09 % for _ p _ and _ n_-type doping respectively .",
    "the 3l - mos@xmath1 shows maximum power factor under nc strain .",
    "while for biaxial strain , the enhanced performance could be achieved under 0.05 % compressive / tensile strain for 2l - mos@xmath1 .",
    "the possibility of tuning of band gap by applying strain provides potential application of mos@xmath0 multilayers not only in thermoelectric but also in sensors and other electromechanical devices .",
    "moreover , the value of the threshold strain provides a means to determine the number of layers in an experimentally grown multilayer mos@xmath1 .",
    "our results indicate that the maximum thermoelectric performance can be achieved under biaxial strain , which can be achievable in experiments .",
    "recently , it has been shown that biaxial strain can be applied by growing thin films on lattice mismatched substrates @xcite .",
    "therefore , the complete potential of tuning electronic and thermoelectric properties of this wonderful material , can be realized experimentally .",
