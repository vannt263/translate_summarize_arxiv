    "construction of chiral gauge theories is one of the long - standing problems of lattice field theories . due to the fermion doubling problems , a naively discretized lattice fermion field yields @xmath4 fermion particles , half of one chirality and half of the other , so that the theory becomes non - chiral@xcite .",
    "several lattice approaches have been proposed , but so far none of them have been proven to work successfully .",
    "kaplan has proposed a new construction of lattice chiral gauge theories via domain - wall models@xcite .",
    "starting from a vector - like gauge theory in @xmath5-dimensions with a fermion mass term being a shape of a domain - wall in the ( extra ) @xmath5-th dimension , he showed in the weak gauge coupling limit that a massless chiral state arises as a zero mode bound to the @xmath6-dimensional domain - wall while all the doublers have large masses of the lattice cut - off scale .",
    "it has been also shown that the model works well for smooth back - ground gauge fields@xcite .",
    "two simplified variants of the original kaplan s domain - wall model have been proposed : an `` overlap formula''@xcite and a `` waveguide model''@xcite .",
    "gauge fields appeared in these variants are @xmath6-dimensional and are independent of the extra @xmath5-th coordinate , while those in the original model are @xmath5-dimensional and depend on the extra @xmath5-th coordinate .",
    "these variants work successfully for smooth back - ground gauge fields@xcite , as the original one does .",
    "non - perturbative investigations for these variants seems easier than for the original model due to the simpler structure of gauge fields .",
    "however it has been reported@xcite that the waveguide model in the weak gauge coupling limit can not produce chiral zero modes needed to construct chiral gauge theories . in this limit , if gauge invariance were maintained , pure gauge field configurations equivalent to the unity by gauge transformation would dominate and gauge fields would become smooth . in the set - up of the waveguide model , however , @xmath6-dimensional gauge fields are non - zero only in the layers near domain - wall ( waveguide ) , so that the gauge invariance is broken in the edge of the waveguide .",
    "therefore , even in the weak gauge coupling limit , gauge fields are no more smooth and becomes very `` rough '' , due to the gauge degrees of freedom appeared to be dynamical in this edge . as a result of the rough gauge dynamics , a new chiral zero mode with the opposite chirality to",
    "the original zero mode on the domain - wall appears in the edge , so that the fermionic spectrum inside the waveguide becomes vector - like .",
    "it has been claimed@xcite that this  rough gauge  problem also exists in the overlap formula since the gauge invariance is broken by the boundary condition at the infinity of the extra dimension@xcite .",
    "furthermore an equivalence between the wave - guide model and the overlap formula has been pointed out for the special case@xcite .",
    "although the claimed equivalence has been challenged in ref.@xcite , it is still crucial for the success of the overlap formula to solve the  rough gauge  problem and to show the existence of a chiral zero mode in the weak gauge coupling limit .",
    "how about original kaplan s model ?",
    "in this model there are two inverse gauge coupling @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the coupling constant in ( physical ) @xmath6-dimensions and @xmath2 is the one in the ( extra ) @xmath5-th dimension . very little are known about this model except @xmath10 case@xcite where the spectrum seems vector - like . in the weak coupling limit , corresponding to the @xmath11 limit in this model , all gauge fields in the physical dimensions can be gauged away , while the gauge field in the extra dimension is still dynamical and its dynamics is controlled by @xmath12",
    ". instead of the gauge degrees of freedom in the edge of the wave - guide , @xmath5-th component of gauge fields represent roughness of @xmath6 dimensional gauge fields .",
    "an important question is whether the chiral zero mode on the domain - wall survives in the presence of this rough dynamics .",
    "the dynamics of the gauge field in this limit is equivalent to @xmath6 dimensional scalar model with @xmath13 independent copies where @xmath13 is the number of sites in the extra dimension . in general at large @xmath12",
    "such a system is in a `` broken phase '' where some global symmetry is spontaneously broken , while at small @xmath12 the system is in a `` symmetric '' phase .",
    "therefore there exists a critical point @xmath14 , and it is likely that the phase transition at @xmath15 is continuous(second or higher order ) . the  gauge field  becomes rougher and rougher at smaller @xmath12 .",
    "indeed we know that the zero modes disappears at @xmath10@xcite , while the zero mode exists at @xmath16 ( free case ) .",
    "so far we do not know the fate of the chiral zero mode in the intermediate range of the coupling @xmath12 .",
    "there are the following 3 possibilities : ( a ) the chiral zero mode always exists except @xmath10 . in this case",
    "we may likely construct a lattice chiral gauge theory in both broken ( @xmath17 ) and symmetric(@xmath18 ) , and the continuum limits may be taken at @xmath19 .",
    "this is the beset case for the domain - wall model .",
    "( b ) the chiral zero mode exists only in the broken phase(@xmath17 ) . in this case",
    "we may construct a lattice chiral gauge theory only in the broken phase via the domain - wall method .",
    "this is unsatisfactory , since the chiral gauge theory in the symmetric phase , which is an important theoretical basis for various models , can not be described via the domain - wall method .",
    "( c ) no chiral zero mode survives except @xmath16 .",
    "the original kaplan s model can not describe lattice chiral gauge theories at all .",
    "it is very important to determine which possibility is indeed realized in the domain - wall model .",
    "therefore , in this paper , in order to know the fate of the chiral zero mode , we have carried out a numerical simulation of a domain - wall model in @xmath0-dimension with a quenched @xmath20 gauge field in the @xmath21 limit .",
    "strictly speaking , there is no order parameter in a 2 dimensional @xmath20 model ( xy model ) . on a large but finite lattice ,",
    "however , a behavior of the 2 dimensional model is similar to the one of a 4 dimensional scalar model .",
    "thus , we hopefully think that useful informations about the fate of the zero mode can be obtained from such a toy model in ( 2 + 1)-dimensions . in sec.2",
    ", we have defined our domain - wall model with dynamical gauge fields .",
    "we have calculated a fermion propagator by using a kind of mean - field approximation , to show that there is a critical value of the domain - wall mass parameter above which the zero mode exist .",
    "the value of the critical mass may depend on @xmath12 , which controls the dynamics of the gauge field . in sec.3",
    ", we have calculated the fermion spectrum numerically using quenched approximation at @xmath22 and at various values of domain - wall masses .",
    "we have found that at any value of three @xmath12 there always exists the range of domain - wall mass parameter in which the chiral zero mode survives on the domain - wall .",

    "we observe , at @xmath1640.99 , a massless fermion of the opposite chirality to the @xmath56 zero mode and a finite difference of masses between the right and the left , which stays finite as we increase the spatial lattice size .",
    "furthermore , in the case of @xmath132 , the right - handed fermion and the left - handed fermion stay massive at all @xmath53 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ symmfs8 ]    from these results above , as the same case in the broken phase , we conclude that the original kaplan s model can create the chiral zero mode on the domain - wall even in the symmetric phase .",
    "using the quenched approximation , we have performed the numerical study of the domain - wall model in ( 2 + 1)-dimensions with the @xmath20 dynamical gauge field on the extra dimension . from this study",
    "we obtain the following results .",
    "there exists the critical value of the domain - wall mass separating the region with a chiral zero mode and the region without it , both in the broken and the symmetric phases of the gauge field . at the domain - wall mass larger than its critical value a zero mode with one chirality exists on the domain - wall and a zero modes with opposite chirality on the anti - domain - wall , and none in the middle between the domain - wall and the anti - domain - wall .",
    "these results strongly suggest that it is possible to construct lattice chiral gauge theories at all @xmath37 except for @xmath95 via the domain - wall method , and continuum limits may possibly be taken at the critical value of @xmath12 where the phase transition takes place . in @xmath0-dimensions",
    ", however , the gauge field in @xmath165 limit is special since there is no order parameter and the phase transition is topological .",
    "thus , to make a definite conclusion on the construction of lattice chiral gauge theories via the domain - wall method , we must study realistic @xmath166-dimensional model with @xmath20 or @xmath167 gauge field in @xmath165 limit .",
    "such models in @xmath165 limit have a phase transition characterized by an order parameter , a vacuum expectation value of the link variables in the extra dimension .    moreover , it is interesting and important to find an appropriate correspondence between the propagator obtained in the numerical simulation and the mean field propagator with tuned parameter @xmath67 .",
    "so far it is not clear what physical quantity is corresponding to @xmath67 .",
    "since zero mode seems to exist even in the symmetric phase , the correspondence ( [ order ] ) is qualitatively incorrect . on the other hand",
    ", we have found that the correspondence ( [ energy ] ) fails to reproduce @xmath168 quantitatively . since mean - field approximations",
    "can not work well in the lower - dimensions in general , we must try to answer these questions studying @xmath166-dimensional @xmath20 or @xmath167 models .",
