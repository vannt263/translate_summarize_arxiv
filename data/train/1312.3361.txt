    "the observed accelerated expansion of the universe  @xcite can be explained within general relativity ( gr ) by including the cosmological constant @xmath0 , a new parameter whose presence is not forbidden by the basic postulates or symmetries of gr . allowing for @xmath0 and some form of cold dark matter ( cdm )",
    ", cosmologists have arrived at a standard model of cosmology , the @xmath0cdm model , whose predictions are in remarkable agreement with observations , such as those from the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) and large scale structures in the universe . but",
    "both cdm and the cosmological constant require some deeper understanding . within extensions of the standard model of particle physics",
    ", cdm may find an explanation such as new particles in models with supersymmetry  @xcite .",
    "the cosmological constant term , however , has yet to be embedded within field theories of particle physics .    instead of a @xmath0-term in einstein s",
    "theory , equivalent to a constant energy density which has to be fine - tuned , many cosmologists would prefer a dynamical explanation for the accelerated expansion  @xcite , preferably one which does not depend on some initial conditions .",
    "therefore , models have been developed in which a dynamical field , usually a scalar field , drives the accelerated expansion of the universe at late times  @xcite .",
    "if the field couples to matter ( baryonic or not ) and the forces are very long - ranged ( typically of the order of the horizon scale ) , the coupling is constrained to be very small , already at times when the photons decouple from baryonic matter in the early universe .",
    "in addition , local experiments  @xcite constrain the coupling of a long - ranged scalar field to normal matter to be smaller than @xmath1 that of gravity . given the strong constraints on long - ranged forces , other types of field theories have been studied , in particular screened models of modified gravity  @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the gravitational sector is modified to include a scalar degree of freedom , whose interactions with ambient matter make the field either short ranged ( as in chameleon/@xmath2 theories  @xcite ) or the effective coupling becomes small in region of high density ( as it is the case of symmetron  @xcite and/or dilaton models  @xcite ) .",
    "these theories behave effectively as the @xmath0cdm model for the background evolution .",
    "the evolution of perturbations on scales outside the compton wavelength of the scalar field is expected to differ only slightly from @xmath0cdm . only on smaller scales , deviations from @xmath0cdm",
    "are expected in these models .",
    "the interaction range usually changes with the cosmological expansion in these models as can the coupling strength , but usually local constraints today impose that in the present universe the range of interaction is less than 1 mpc . therefore to test these models with cosmological observations , predictions for structure formation at small length scales need to be studied in detail using n - body simulations  @xcite .",
    "larger scales affected by linear perturbation theory can show deviations which are smaller but could still be within reach by precision cosmology . in the future , besides the large scale structure surveys at low redshifts , the 21-cm signal from the reionisation or the late dark ages will possibly enable us to draw a tomographic view of the matter distribution up to redshifts @xmath3",
    "@xcite , higher redshifts being much more difficult to probe with earth - based radiotelescopes . at those redshifts ,",
    "short scales which would be non - linear in the very late time universe appear in the linear regime .",
    "21-cm tomography therefore should be promising to constrain deviations from the linear growth of perturbations in general relativity , and thus to constrain modified gravity  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we address the following questions : i ) how can screened gravity affect the evolution of linear perturbations before recombination ? and",
    "ii ) imposing the bbn and local test constraints on screened modified gravity theory , can we find new regimes / models for which those effects leave observable imprints on the cmb as well as the matter power spectrum ?",
    "these questions are considered for two classes of screened gravity models : generalised chameleons , to which the @xmath4 , dilaton and chameleon models belong , and a new phenomenological model where the coupling of the scalar field to matter undergoes a transition before the time of last scattering .",
    "notice that viable @xmath4 models are typical examples of the application of the chameleon mechanism @xcite . in the absence of this screening behaviour in the presence of matter",
    ", @xmath4 models would lead to an enhancement of newton s law locally which would be ruled out experimentally . for this purpose ,",
    "we use the fact that models of screened modified gravity can be described by two functions of the scale - factor @xmath5  @xcite : the effective mass @xmath6 of the scalar field and the couplings to matter @xmath7 .",
    "this parameterisation is equivalent to describing the modified gravity models using field dependent interaction potentials @xmath8 and coupling to matter functions @xmath9 .",
    "the simplest models such as @xmath4 gravity and chameleons use an exponential function for @xmath9 corresponding to a constant coupling @xmath10 to matter .",
    "this is enough to guarantee of the screening effects of the scalar field thanks to the chameleon mechanism in these models @xcite . for dilaton @xcite and symmetron models @xcite where the scalar field is screened in dense environments thanks to the damour - polyakov effect @xcite",
    ", the function @xmath9 is not exponential anymore and the coupling to matter @xmath11 becomes field dependent . in the tomographic approach ,",
    "all these models are described within one framework via different @xmath6 and @xmath7 functions .",
    "we shall see that there can be significant deviations from @xmath0cdm in the cmb spectrum for the transition models where the modifications of gravity are significant before recombination .",
    "these manifest themselves as both enhancements and reductions of power on different scales .",
    "it is possible to choose parameters such that these differences are at the percent level while preserving structure formation and evading local tests of gravity .",
    "in contrast we find that , for generalised chameleon models with couplings that are stronger at earlier rather than later times , the constraint on the variation over time of particle masses is violated before we observe effects on the cmb . for these models",
    "it would seem that large scale structure is the best cosmological test .",
    "therefore we conclude that the signatures of the generalised chameleons and the early transition models are sufficiently different to envisage the possibility of distinguishing different models of modified gravity using cmb data if they were ever to be observed .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in the next section , we briefly summarise models of screened modified gravity , using the @xmath6 , @xmath7 parametrisation",
    ". we will also impose local constraints on those theories . in section 3",
    "we write down the perturbation equations and derive an analytical solution for the baryon perturbation during tight coupling . in section 4",
    "we study the evolution of the perturbations numerically .",
    "we conclude in section 5 .",
    "details of the numerical implementation are summarised in the appendix .",
    "scalar fields coupled to matter and with a long interaction range compared to the size of the solar system may play a role on cosmological scales as suggested by the discovery of the acceleration of the universe .",
    "this would be in conflict with with experimental tests on the existence of fifth forces in the solar system such as the one given by the cassini probe @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the scalar field can be screened in dense environments and therefore evade gravitational tests .",
    "this is the case for models subject to the chameleon and damour - polyakov mechanisms . in the following",
    ", we will use models of this type which could have consequences on the cosmic microwave background .",
    "we focus on scalar tensor theories defined by the action s = d^4 x + s_m , where @xmath9 is an arbitrary function , @xmath8 is the scalar potential and matter fields couple to the jordan frame metric [ confrel ] g_^j= a^2 ( ) g_^e , where the superscript e refers to the einstein frame and j to the jordan frame . in the presence of non - relativistic matter",
    ", the dynamics of the scalar field are dictated by the effective potential v_eff()= v ( ) + _ m , where @xmath12 is the matter energy density .",
    "when the effective potential has a matter dependent minimum @xmath13 , and if the effective mass of the scalar field m^2(_m)= .",
    "|_=_min(_m ) becomes large enough to reduce the range of the scalar interaction , the effects of the scalar field on matter are screened  @xcite .",
    "this happens in models such as chameleons where the potential is an inverse power law and the coupling to matter ( _ m)= m_pl .",
    "|_=_min(_m ) evaluated at the minimum , is constant . on the contrary",
    "if the coupling is not a constant anymore but converges to zero when the density increases , gravity tests on the existence of fifth forces can be evaded too @xcite .",
    "this is the damour - polyakov mechanism @xcite .",
    "let us first present a large class of models where the chameleon mechanism is necessary and at play .",
    "consistent @xmath4 models are highly relevant modifications of gravity which can serve as templates for the chameleon mechanism .",
    "indeed , they must be in agreement with local constraints coming from gravitational tests .",
    "a way of fulfilling these bounds is to employ the chameleon mechanism in these theories .",
    "the @xmath4 models where the action is given by s = d^4x can be written in the einstein frame using the scalar field defined implicitly by = e^-2/m_pl , where @xmath14 and we have a^2()=e^2/m_pl .",
    "the interaction potential is v()= .",
    "naively , one would conclude that @xmath10 is so large that these models are excluded by gravity tests .",
    "in fact , this is not case when the choice of @xmath4 is such that @xmath8 is a decreasing function @xmath15 and therefore @xmath16 admits a matter dependent minimum @xcite .",
    "the chameleon mechanism applies for a wide range of models , such as @xcite @xmath17~,\\nonumber\\\\ f(r ) & = & r - m^2 \\frac{c_1 ( r / m^2)^n}{c2(r / m^2)^n + 1}~.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these models are excellent templates to study modified gravity in the late time universe . in particular , in the limit of large curvature , the second model behaves as [ lcm ] f(r)=+ r -  .",
    "we will later relate this model to a screened scalar field model via a tomographic map discussed below .",
    "the string dilaton @xcite at strong coupling is an example where the damour - polyakov is at play , v()=v_0 e^-/m_pl ,  a()= 1 + ( -_)^2 and @xmath18 to guarantee that the field converges to @xmath19 in dense environments where the coupling to matter vanishes .",
    "another family of such models are the symmetrons @xcite where @xmath8 is a symmetry breaking potential where the symmetry is restored at the origin and broken for @xmath20 .",
    "when the function a()= 1 + ^2 is chosen , with @xmath18 , the symmetry is restored in dense environments and broken in vacuum .",
    "all in all , we see that a variety of screened modified gravity models have been described using various functional forms for @xmath8 and @xmath9 which corresponds to field dependent couplings to matter [ betadef ] ( ) = m_pl .",
    "in fact a tomographic method has been devised where all these models can be captured by the sole time dependence of the coupling function @xmath7 and the mass @xmath6 at the cosmological minimum of the effective potential as a function of the cosmological scale factor @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "we will use this versatile approach explicitly in the following .      before moving on to the description of the effects of early modifications of gravity on the cmb , we briefly comment on the einstein frame ( used in this paper ) and its relation to the jordan frame .",
    "when studying the growth of structure or the cmb , one needs to describe the cosmological perturbations of the models ( for a thorough description of the cosmological perturbation theory in these models , see @xcite ) .",
    "this could be equivalently achieved using the jordan or the einstein frame . for studies of structure formation in modified gravity theories ,",
    "working effectively in the jordan frame , see @xcite and references therein .    in the einstein frame ,",
    "the einstein equation is not modified and for a single scalar field , no anisotropic stress is generated by the scalar field .",
    "this follows immediately from the einstein equations .",
    "the metric perturbations can be described in the conformal newtonian gauge where the metric reads @xmath21.\\ ] ] in the case of vanishing anisotropic stress , einstein s equations give @xmath22 , which is valid in the einstein frame .",
    "the jordan frame metric is related to the einstein frame metric via a conformal transformation as in eq .",
    "( [ confrel ] ) .    writing @xmath23,\\ ] ]",
    "one can easily show by perturbing ( [ confrel ] ) that ( see also @xcite ) @xmath24 thus , if for example in the einstein frame the anisotropic stress is zero , then @xmath25 , but in the jordan frame @xmath26 , with @xmath10 defined in ( [ betadef ] ) .",
    "we emphasise again that both frames are on the same footing ( at least classically ) and the calculations can be done in either frames .    in the following",
    ", we will consider the cosmological perturbations of the models . a convenient choice to describe the perturbation is the einstein frame where we have only one metric perturbation @xmath27 in the absence of anisotropic stress and one scalar perturbation coming from the scalar field . in the conformal newton gauge",
    ", the scalar perturbation can be conveniently represented by the perturbation of the scalar field @xmath28 .",
    "other choices such as the mukhanov - sasaki variable could have been taken .",
    "it turns out the the choice of @xmath28 is more easily implemented numerically . in the numerical applications , we always consider two newtonian potentials @xmath27 and @xmath29 as the total anisotropic stress does not always vanish , for instance in the presence of neutrinos .      as already mentioned , we are interested in the effects of scalars mediating a screened modification of gravity on the cmb and large scale structure formation .",
    "we shall work in the einstein frame where the einstein equations are preserved and depend on the energy momentum tensor of the scalar field : @xmath30.\\ ] ] we impose that matter couples to both gravity and the scalar field via the metrics @xmath31 for each matter species .",
    "their couplings to matter are defined as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the reduced planck mass , and which may be field dependent in dilatonic models for instance .",
    "it is a universal constant @xmath34 in @xmath4 models",
    ". we will give specific examples later using generalised chameleonic models and models where the coupling function has a transition before recombination .",
    "in all the models that we will consider , the background cosmology is tantamount to a @xmath0cdm model since big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "deviations from general relativity only appear at the perturbative level .",
    "moreover , the effective potential for the scalar field in the matter era is modified by the presence of matter as a consequence of the non - trivial matter couplings @xmath35 \\rho_{\\alpha},\\ ] ] where the sum is taken over the non - relativistic species and @xmath36 is the conserved energy density of the fluid @xmath37 , related to the normal einstein frame matter density by @xmath38 .",
    "the potential acquires a slowly varying minimum @xmath39 as long as the mass @xmath40 is larger than the hubble rate .",
    "we will always assume that this is the case in the following . due to the interaction with the scalar field ,",
    "matter is not conserved and satisfies @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the energy momentum tensor of the species @xmath37 and @xmath43 its trace .",
    "notice that radiation is not affected by the presence of the coupled scalar field .",
    "the einstein equations are not modified and read @xmath44 the conservation equations and the einstein equations are enough to characterise the time evolution of the fields .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the total coupling function @xmath45 a=_f_a _ , where @xmath46 is the constant fraction of the species @xmath37 where @xmath47 is the total conserved energy density of non - relativistic matter .",

    "[ eq : minimum_condition ] also implies that [ eq : tomography2 ] v(a)= v_0 - _ a_i^a da , yielding an implicit definition of @xmath8 .",

    "when the field sits in the minimum of the effective potential , the background follows that closely of a @xmath0cdm model , with the evolution of @xmath56 given in ( [ eq : tomography2 ] ) .",
    "but we will see that quite distinctive features can appear when the evolution of perturbations is studied . to be concrete , we will concentrate on two models in this paper , which we will now describe .      in our first model",

    "such a model corresponds to generalised chameleons  @xcite .",
    "setting @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , one recovers the large curvature @xmath4 model @xcite .",
    "we focus here on the case @xmath60 , for which the coupling to matter is very large during the tight coupling regime but smaller at later times .",
    "as we shall discuss in section [ localtests ] , the local tests will impose different constraints on @xmath61 and @xmath62 for different combinations of the exponents @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "one also requires @xmath65 during the matter dominated era , and @xmath66 during the radiation era , so that the scalar field mass is always much larger than the hubble rate , guaranteeing a @xmath0cdm background expansion .",
    "the second model we consider is where the universe undergoes a smooth but rapid transition from an epoch of strong coupling between the scalar field and matter to one when the coupling is small and has negligible effect on the growth of perturbations @xcite . using the tomographic maps allowing one to reconstruct @xmath8 and @xmath11",
    ", one finds that the potential is an inverse power law both before and after a transition point @xmath67 where the potential decreases abruptly . the effective potential , both before and after the transition , has a minimum with a large mass where the field gets trapped .",
    "dynamically , the field undergoing the transition jumps from the minimum before the transition to the minimum after the transition where it will oscillate a few times before being rapidly ( the amplitude decreases like @xmath68 ) stuck at the minimum again .",
    "we will neglect these decaying oscillations in the following and assume that the field tracks the minimum at all times ( for a similar type of phenomenon , see the thorough analysis of the transition in @xcite . in order to satisfy the constraints imposed by local tests we are considering very high masses and",
    "this will ensure that the field remains close to the minimum through the transition .",
    "we can parameterise this behaviour with the function _ c ,",
    "b(a ) = _ 0 +  , where the parameter @xmath69 controls the duration of the transition .",
    "we choose the effective mass of the scalar field to evolve like a power - law m(a ) = m_0 a^-p . by setting the transition prior to last scattering ,",
    "we ensure that all the effects on the cmb angular power spectrum and on the matter power spectrum are mainly caused by the modification of gravity before recombination .",
    "note however that the linear perturbations at recombination , which can be used as initial conditions for the growth of the matter perturbations , are modified and thus can lead to a different evolution compared to the @xmath0cdm model , even if there is no direct effect of modified gravity on the growth of structures .",
    "for the parameters we have considered , values of @xmath70 do not lead to any visible modification in the growth of perturbations after last scattering .",
    "since we are considering rather high masses this means a strong coupling even up to the present epoch is not ruled out .      in all the models that we consider the masses of fundamental particles vary as m_= a()m_bare , where @xmath71 is the bare mass appearing in the matter lagrangian .",
    "the measurements of primordial light element abundances place a tight constraint on the time variation of fermion masses since bbn  @xcite = 0.1 .",

    "typically , we will see that this constraint is superseded by the local constraints .",
    "we will now examine the constraints on our two models coming from local tests of gravity .",
    "we focus on three tests which can yield strong constraints on screened models .",

    "we see that the odd peaks , corresponding to maxima in @xmath184 , are enhanced with respect to @xmath0cdm whilst the even ones , corresponding to minima in @xmath184 , are reduced .",
    "so far this agrees with what we observe in the @xmath166 s for the @xmath165 case .",
    "the troughs in @xmath183 come from the zeros in @xmath185 and so at these points the difference with @xmath0cdm vanishes .",
    "however , as we observed above the troughs in the @xmath166 s are alternately enhanced and reduced just like the peaks .",
    "we can understand this by noting that the @xmath166 troughs , unlike those in @xmath183 , are not zeros .",
    "this is because the anisotropy at a given @xmath164 is created by many modes with wavenumbers greater than that of the principal corresponding @xmath182-mode .",
    "the biggest contribution though will come from modes with only slightly larger @xmath182 which explains why the troughs preceding odd peaks are also higher and those preceding even peaks are also lower .",
    "when the transition occurs before last scattering the picture is more complicated .",
    "the periods of enhancement and reduction of power in the @xmath166 s are different . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : transfers ] the effect of modified gravity on the photon transfer function at last scattering is no longer positive on all scales",

    "if however we look at the photon transfer functions at @xmath186 ( fig .",

    "fig : transfers ] ) which occurs despite the fact that , as a result of the very high effective mass of the field , effectively all scales ( @xmath197 ) are always outside the compton wavelength .",
