    "the saffman - taylor problem  @xcite , in which two immiscible , viscous fluids move in a narrow space between the parallel plates of a hele - shaw cell , is a widely studied example of hydrodynamic pattern formation where interfacial instabilities grow and evolve  @xcite .",

    "the resulting interfacial patterns , in a rectangular hele - shaw cell , are an intriguing superposition of familiar forms from ordinary viscous fingering and labyrinthine patterns .",
    "two immediately striking features of the patterns : the pattern of low viscosity fluid penetrating into high viscosity fluid is totally unlike the pattern of high viscosity fluid penetrating into low viscosity fluid ; finger splitting is prevalent , while in general it is completely absent in zero external magnetic field .",

    "magnetic forces do not contribute to this , or any even order , term .",
    "rather , finger competition depends upon the viscosity contrast @xmath0 .",
    "we conclude our discussion at third order . here , we show that finger tips may split due to coupling of a fundamental mode with its own harmonic .",

    "each mode grows or decays independently of all others , with exponential growth rate @xmath80 given in equation  ( [ lambda ] ) .",
    "positive values of @xmath80 make a mode unstable to growth of an initially small perturbation .",

    "we graph @xmath80 for three values of the magnetic bond number , @xmath84 .",
    "in general these plots display a range of wavenumbers over which @xmath85 .",
    "we define two special wavenumbers : @xmath86 , the wavenumber of the fastest growing mode , maximizes @xmath80 ; @xmath87 , the threshold wavenumber beyond which all modes are stable , is the largest wavenumber for which @xmath80 vanishes . when @xmath88 and @xmath89 we have @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the magnetic field is destabilizing .",
    "as the magnetic bond number grows , @xmath86 and @xmath87 shift to the right and modes of higher wavenumber become unstable . likewise , for any particular mode @xmath48 , the growth rate @xmath80 increases , causing perturbations to grow more rapidly .    to analyze mechanisms of pattern selection",
    ", we will focus our attention on the interaction of one large amplitude perturbation , which we call the `` fundamental '' , with small amplitude perturbations of its own harmonic and subharmonic .",
    "we take the fundamental wavenumber @xmath92 of the fastest growing mode .",
    "the harmonic mode @xmath93 always lies to the right of the threshold wavenumber @xmath87 , so the harmonic mode is always linearly stable against growth .",
    "the subharmonic mode @xmath94 usually lies in the unstable regime . if present in the initial conditions it will grow , but less quickly than the fundamental .",
    "growth of the fundamental mode creates a sinusoidal oscillation of the initially flat interface , forming fingers of each fluid penetrating into the region previously occupied by the other fluid .",
    "the interface is symmetric , with upwards and downwards fingers having identical length and width .",
    "depending upon the phase of the subharmonic relative to the fundamental , either the upwards - pointing fingers , or the downwards pointing fingers may have their length modulated .",
    "the subharmonic can break the up - down symmetry of the growing pattern .",
    "however , within the linear stability analysis , no unique phase of the subharmonic is favored . assuming the relative phase is determined by random perturbation of the flat interface",
    ", the growing pattern will retain _ statistical _ up - down symmetry .",
    "for any given initial condition , symmetry will be broken , but averaged over all initial conditions , symmetry will remain .",
    "splitting of fingers is not predicted by linear stability analysis , because the harmonic mode is required to split fingers , and the harmonic mode is linearly stable .      inspecting the mode coupling equation  ( [ modecoupling ] ) ,",
    "we note that the second order term does not involve magnetic field .",
    "we have previously  @xcite analyzed the role of the second order term in rectangular flow geometry for non - magnetic fluids .",
    "the results are unchanged , so we will simply recall two essential facts : the second order term generates finger competition dependent upon the viscosity contrast @xmath0 ; the second order term does not generate finger tip - splitting .",
    "we explain these two points briefly .",
    "finger competition is linked with the amplitude and phase of the subharmonic mode .",
    "coupling of the fundamental @xmath95 to the growth of its subharmonic @xmath96 accelerates growth of the subharmonic , and selects a preferred phase .",
    "the selected phase varies the relative lengths of fingers of the less viscous fluid penetrating into the more viscous fluid .",
    "fingers of more viscous fluid penetrating into the less viscous fluid tend toward equal lengths .",
    "the subharmonic therefore breaks the statistical up - down symmetry of the linear stability theory .",
    "finger tip - splitting requires the harmonic mode . in the radial flow geometry",
    "@xcite , second order terms drive growth of the harmonic mode @xmath97 despite its linear stability . these terms are absent due to the rectangular flow geometry . as we explain in the following section , one must examine the third order terms to understand growth of the harmonic .",
    "we conclude this discussion with an explanation for the absence of magnetic field effects at second order .",
    "although the basic equation of motion  ( [ darcy ] ) is written in terms of forces , it is simplest to carry out the discussion in terms of energies .",
    "consider the magnetic energy for a given interface shape @xmath98 .",
    "the magnetic energy is unaffected by rotation of the entire experiment ( hele - shaw cell and magnet ) by 180@xmath99 around the @xmath50 axis . because the ferrofluid is paramagnetic , the magnetic energy is invariant under reversing the direction of the applied field",
    ". the combination of the two symmetries , rotation of the experiment followed by reversal of the applied field , amounts to reversing the sign of the interfacial displacement @xmath98 .",
    "since the magnetic energy can not be affected by this change , it must be an even function of @xmath98 .",
    "the magnetic force is given by the change in magnetic energy with respect to variation in interfacial shape , so it must be an odd function of @xmath98 .",
    "this section shows how the magnetic field qualitatively alters the mechanism for splitting of finger tips .",
    "we first review previous results explaining the general absence of tip splitting in rectangular geometry flow of ordinary fluids  @xcite .",
    "then we describe a new mechanism for splitting finger tips in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "we consider the influence of the fundamental and sub - harmonic modes on the growth of the first harmonic .",
    "finger tip - splitting is associated with the magnitude and phase of the harmonic mode @xmath100 .",
    "it is convenient for the subsequent discussions to consider sine and cosine modes , rather than the complex modes employed in equation  ( [ modecoupling ] ) . describing the fundamental as a cosine mode with positive amplitude",
    ", we only need to examine the subharmonic and harmonic cosine modes to analyze finger competition and tip - splitting .",
    "let @xmath101 denote the amplitude of the cosine mode of wavenumber @xmath48 .",
    "earlier papers considered finger tip - splitting for hele - shaw flow of nonmagnetic fluids in the radial  @xcite and rectangular  @xcite geometries . of course , the same results hold for ferrofluids in the absence of applied magnetic fields .",
    "the principal results are as follows . in the radial geometry , a term proportional to @xmath102 drives growth of the harmonic with the phase appropriate to split finger tips . in the rectangular geometry",
    ", this second order term is missing . instead",
    ", there is a third order driving term proportional to @xmath103 .",
    "this term is expected to be too small to split finger tips .",
    "there is also a reduction in the effective stability of the harmonic mode for large amplitude of the fundamental , but this effect can not make the harmonic linearly unstable .",
    "consequently , finger tips do not split under normal circumstances in the rectangular geometry .",
    "now we investigate the connection between the applied magnetic field and the occurrence of finger tip - splitting observed in hele - shaw cell experiments with ferrofluids . for consistency with experimental results  @xcite",
    "we consider the case @xmath88 .",
    "the equation of motion for the harmonic mode ( neglecting terms of order @xmath104 ) is @xmath105   + n_{b } k_{h } \\left [ \\frac{1}{12 } t(k_{s } ) + \\frac{1}{24 } t(k_{f } ) \\right ]    \\right \\ } a_{k_f}a_{k_s}^{2}. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we incorporate certain third order terms into the effective linear growth rate @xmath106 - n_{b } k_{h } \\left [ \\frac{1}{6 } t(k_{f } ) + \\frac{1}{12 } t(k_{h } ) \\right ]   \\right \\ }",

    "are explicitly multiplied by @xmath107 and others are not .",
    "we refer to the former as `` magnetic '' terms , and the latter as `` nonmagnetic '' .",
    "the nonmagnetic terms reproduce the known mode coupling equation for nonmagnetic fluids  @xcite .",
    "our mechanism for splitting finger tips focuses on @xmath108 .",
    "initially , this quantity is close to @xmath109 , which is strongly negative because the harmonic mode is stable in the linear theory .",
    "however , @xmath108 is increased by the presence of the modes @xmath95 and @xmath96 , because the coefficients multiplying their squared amplitudes are positive . to verify this point , recall that @xmath110 , making the nonmagnetic contribution manifestly positive . also , the values of @xmath69 are negative , making the magnetic contribution manifestly positive .",
    "since we consider the case in which @xmath111 is considerably larger than @xmath112 , the dominant corrections to the effective growth rate come from the terms multiplying @xmath102 . in the following ,",
    "we concentrate our discussion on those terms .",
    "nonmagnetic terms make the effective growth rate less negative but can not make it go positive .",
    "the physical reason that these terms do not make @xmath108 positive can be understood by considering the contour length of the interface .",
    "introducing the harmonic always increases the contour length , although the larger the amplitude of the fundamental , the smaller the increase upon introducing the harmonic . multiplying the contour length by the surface tension yields surface energy that favors minimum contour length .",
    "mathematically , the nonmagnetic term of order @xmath102 makes @xmath108 less negative , but if higher orders in perturbation theory were included it would be evident that @xmath111 can not drive @xmath108 positive without assistance from the magnetic terms .",
    "the terms in @xmath108 that are multiplied by @xmath107 allow @xmath108 to eventually go positive , permitting growth of the harmonic .",
    "the effective growth rate remains negative up to a threshold value of @xmath113 for which @xmath114 .",
    "when @xmath113 grows beyond this threshold value , @xmath115 grows rapidly .",
    "the threshold value of @xmath111 should vary as the inverse square root of the magnetic bond number , so tip splitting emerges sooner in strong magnetic fields .",
    "the harmonic mode enters spontaneously through the third order driving term proportional to @xmath103 in equation  ( [ akh ] ) .",
    "as long as @xmath108 remains negative , this small driving force should be of little consequence .",
    "after @xmath108 goes positive , however , this term can introduce a harmonic even if none is present in initial conditions .",
    "the existence and phase of the spontaneously generated harmonic depends on interplay of the fundamental and the subharmonic .    to illustrate the occurrence of finger tip - splitting when an external magnetic field is applied",
    ", we consider the interaction of modes @xmath116 and @xmath117 with the forced modes @xmath100 and @xmath118 .",
    "mode @xmath118 behaves similarly to the sub - harmonic @xmath117 and induces more finger competition . in figure  [ evol ]",
    "we plot the interface evolution using the full solution to third order of equation  ( [ modecoupling ] ) .",
    "we examine the case in which @xmath88 , assuming that fluid 2 is a ferrofluid .",
    "an external magnetic field is applied ( @xmath119 ) normal to the cell plates .",
    "the initial condition is @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "the harmonic mode is absent initially .",
    "times shown are @xmath122 .",
    "the effective harmonic growth rate @xmath108 starts being strongly negative at @xmath123 .",
    "it increases with time , goes through zero @xmath124 , and become positive .",
    "this process leads to finger tip - splitting by @xmath125 , as shown in figure  [ evol ] .",
    "finger tip - splitting only occurs after the fundamental has grown sufficiently that @xmath108 goes positive . the selected phase of the harmonic splits the tips of fingers whose length is variable , the less viscous fingers .",
    "several features of the patterns formed in saffman - taylor experiments with ferrofluids can now be explained .",
    "first of all , there is the striking asymmetry of the interface .",
    "since the dense upper fluid is a glycerine - based ferrofluid with high viscosity , and the less dense lower fluid is white spirit , we can understand the initial asymmetry of the interface purely on the basis of the viscosity contrast @xmath0 , as discussed in section  [ second ] .",
    "indeed , with the field turned off the interface is quite asymmetric , with short and wide upwards fingers of the less viscous fluid and long , thin downward fingers of the more viscous fluid .",
    "magnetic field effects can exaggerate an already asymmetric interface , but they can not break the symmetry by themselves",
    ". it would be of considerable interest to perform the experiment with immiscible viscosity - matched fluids .",
    "next , there is the splitting of finger tips which is not normally observed in rectangular geometry flow .",
    "both upwards and downwards fingers are split , consistent with a positive value of @xmath108 permitting the growth of harmonics of any phase .",
    "the upwards fingers are more strongly split , however , consistent with the phase preferred by the driving force in equation  ( [ akh ] ) . both are predictions of our third order analysis in section  [ third ] .",
    "it would be of interest to examine the relationship between the onset of tip splitting and the strength of applied magnetic field experimentally .",
    "the above features are explained by our mode coupling theory .",
    "another notable feature of the patterns is the nearly constant width and regular spacing of downward pointing fingers of high viscosity fluid .",
    "the constant width is probably the known field - dependent preferred finger width of the labyrinthine instability  @xcite , proportional to the plate spacing @xmath1 .",
    "given a directed set of thin fingers , magnetic forces will drive them towards maximal spacing , resulting in a regularly spaced array .",
    "these issues lie beyond the scope of our low order mode coupling approach , but may be amenable to more general forms of weakly nonliner analysis .",

    "<S> we consider this problem in a rectangular flow geometry using a perturbative mode - coupling analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we deduce two general results : viscosity contrast between the fluids drives interface asymmetry , with no contribution from magnetic forces ; magnetic repulsion within the ferrofluid generates finger tip - splitting , which is absent in the rectangular geometry for ordinary fluids .     + michael widom and jos a. miranda + _ department of physics , carnegie mellon university , pittsburgh , pa 15213 _ +    pacs </S>",
