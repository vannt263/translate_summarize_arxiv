    "direct searches for dark matter ( dm ) at underground experiments and for higgs bosons and new particles at the cern lhc collider represent powerful probes into extensions of the standard model ( sm ) , including a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) protected by a symmetry ensuring its stability .    in the last few years , the dama / libra  @xcite",
    ", cogent  @xcite and cresst - ii  @xcite experiments have all reported excesses of events over their estimated backgrounds , which can be interpreted as due to low - mass dark matter wimps interacting in their detectors .",
    "these claims had to be confronted to the negative results of searches conducted by the cdms  @xcite and xenon  @xcite experiments , as well as the absence of new physics reported by the atlas and cms experiments at the lhc . in an earlier paper  @xcite",
    ", we showed that the events of dama / libra , cogent and cresst - ii were consistent with a supersymmetric ( susy ) scenario with a light neutralino , @xmath1 , and an almost degenerate scalar lepton , gaugino , or scalar bottom , which would have escaped searches based on hadronic jets plus missing transverse energy ( met ) signatures at the lhc , due to the very low transverse energy of the jets .",
    "the scenario with scalar bottom , @xmath2 , as the next lightest susy particle ( nlsp ) gave the best in agreement with the available experimental results and with a neutralino mass below @xmath320  gev . here",
    "we pursue further this scenario .",
    "other recent studies on neutralino dm in supersymmetry have been presented in  @xcite .",
    "the recent analysis of the cdms - ii data has isolated three possible signal events , with a small expected background  @xcite .",
    "if these events are due to the interaction of wimps in the cdms detector , the wimp mass and scattering cross section would be comparable to those already highlighted by the other experiments reporting possible excesses of events .",
    "the first data from the planck satellite  @xcite have improved the determination of the dm relic density , @xmath4 , through the study of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "the atlas and cms experiments at lhc have discovered a higgs - like scalar particle with a mass of @xmath5126  gev and significantly extended the constraints on susy with analyses sensitive also to the production of weakly interacting particle partners .",
    "the higgs boson discovery and the first determination of the rates of its decays are crucial to the interpretation of dm results .",
    "the higgs boson participates to the processes of dm annihilation and wimp scattering on nucleons , and new massive particles , such as wimps , should couple to the higgs field , thus affecting the higgs decay pattern .",
    "this paper discusses the viability of a susy interpretation of the reported excesses in dm direct searches , all pointing to a wimp with mass in the range 5  25  gev and scattering cross section , @xmath6 10@xmath7 ",
    "10@xmath8  pb , in the light of the latest lhc results .",
    "we consider the specific light , almost degenerate neutralino - sbottom scenario identified in  @xcite . in this scenario , a large mixing angle @xmath9 corresponding to a mainly right - handed @xmath2 decouples the light scalar bottom from the @xmath10 boson and makes possible to have a very light @xmath2 if @xmath11 is light . compared to our previous study , here",
    "we focus on the interplay between susy low mass particle partners and the higgs boson signal strengths and that between the higgs mass and the wimp annihilation and wimp - nucleon scattering processes , relevant to the relic dm density and direct and indirect detection signals , in this specific scenario .",
    "the first determinations of the @xmath3126  gev higgs - like scalar particle by the lhc experiments with a useful accuracy and the results of a broad spectrum of searches have significant implications on susy scenarios with very light particles , which are now discussed in detail . in this study",
    ", we consider these constraints on the proposed light , almost degenerate neutralino - sbottom scenario coming from electroweak precision data , lhc susy and exotic searches and higgs data , simulating events for the selected mssm points and explicitly checking that these are not excluded by the latest , preliminary 8  tev lhc results .",
    "we also discuss the results obtained using different approaches for the computation of the wimp scattering cross section , compared to that used in  @xcite , in response to a recent study  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "ii we review the supersymmetric dark matter in view of the available constraints . in section iii",
    "we describe in detail the lhc constraints .",
    "the pmssm scenario with a light neutralino and almost degenerate scalar bottom @xmath2 is discussed in section iv , while section v gives our conclusions .",
    "in this study we consider the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) with the @xmath1 as the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) and r - parity conservation .",
    "we take the susy mass terms and trilinear couplings as independent free parameters , leading to the 19-parameter phenomenological mssm ( pmssm ) model .",
    "if the @xmath1 mass is as light as the wimp particle compatible with the dama / libra , cogent , cresst and cdms results , appropriate mechanisms must be in place not to exceed the @xmath4 upper bound derived by the wmap  @xcite and planck  @xcite cmb data and also to escape collider precision data , such as the tight constraints from the @xmath10 lineshape measurements at lep . in our earlier study",
    "@xcite , we could identify only one viable scenario in the pmssm consistent with the @xmath4 upper bound , the excesses of events in the direct detection experiments and the lep constraints . in this scenario",
    "the @xmath2 scalar quark is very light and the squark mixing angle @xmath9 large , close to @xmath12 , to make the @xmath2 , then mainly @xmath11 , almost degenerate with the @xmath1 lsp and with reduced coupling to the @xmath10 . the concurrent light @xmath2 mass and its decoupling from the @xmath10 through a large value of @xmath9 offered a compelling mssm scenario with a low mass wimp compatible with the available data .",
    "the tools used to perform the scans and the analysis have been presented in ref .",
    "most relevant to this study are the calculations of the neutralino scattering cross sections and relic density .",
    "these are calculated using darksusy 5.1.1  @xcite and superiso relic v3.2  @xcite , respectively .",
    "we comment on the comparison of darksusy with the results obtained with micromegas  @xcite , used in our previous study , in section  [ sec : direct ] .",
    "susy particle spectra are calculated using softsusy 3.2.3  @xcite .",
    "hdecay ( 5.10 )  @xcite and sdecay  @xcite compute the decay branching fractions for the higgs and susy particles , respectively . in order to check the compatibility of selected pmssm points with various searches at lep and the lhc we simulate event sample and",
    "perform a parametric simulation for event reconstruction .",
    "events are generated with madgraph 5  @xcite and pythia 8.150  @xcite and detector fast simulation is performed using delphes 3.0  @xcite .",
    "susy searches at lep and the tevatron have set stringent constraints on light supersymmetric particle masses .",
    "however , their sensitivity depends on the mass splittings of the susy particles and the lsp , @xmath14 . here",
    ", we apply the same mass limits as in our previous study , and comment on the most constraining measurements .",
    "the most constraining lep observable for this scenario is the @xmath10 boson width .",
    "the @xmath10 boson decay to two neutralinos contributes to the invisible @xmath10 width , measured to be @xmath15 mev , consistent with the sm prediction  @xcite .",
    "we impose the decay width to two neutralinos to be smaller than 3  mev , i.e.  within the measurement accuracy .",
    "since in our scenario @xmath1 is bino - like and couples only very weakly to the @xmath10 boson , this constraint is easily satisfied .",
    "the scalar bottom quark is also very light and the @xmath10 boson can decay into a @xmath16 pair .",
    "this decay contributes to the total @xmath10 width .",
    "the lep measurements give @xmath17  mev  @xcite .",
    "we require that the sum of the @xmath10 decay widths to neutralino and scalar bottom pairs is smaller than 5  mev , which corresponds to a 2@xmath18 deviation from the measured value , accounting for the theoretical uncertainty from the sbottom mixing calculation .",
    "since the sbottom mixing angle , @xmath9 , is close to @xmath12 and the @xmath2 is mainly right - handed , the coupling of the @xmath2 to the @xmath10 boson is reduced , leading to a small decay width , so that a significant fraction of the pmssm points corresponding to our scenario are in agreement with this constraint .    a third important observable is the ratio @xmath19 of the @xmath10 decay width to two bottom quarks over the @xmath10 total hadronic width .",
    "this has been measured very precisely  @xcite .",
    "the presence of light sbottoms could indeed modify at loop level the effective coupling of the bottoms to the @xmath10 .",
    "we compute @xmath19 for the points passing the @xmath10 decay width constraints and find that it agrees within one standard deviation with the experimental measurements as a result of the reduced coupling of the @xmath2 to the @xmath10 .",
    "another relevant observable is the forward - backward asymmetry on the @xmath10 peak in the @xmath20 channel @xcite , which presents 2.5@xmath18 discrepancy between the sm and the measured values . in our scenario , while the discrepancy is not improved by the presence of the light sbottoms , our points are in agreement with the experimental result at the 3@xmath18 level .",
    "constraints from the @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 parameters  @xcite , encoding the oblique corrections , i.e.  the radiative corrections to weak processes involving light particles , need also to be considered .",
    "in particular , susy contributions to these parameters arise also from squark and neutralino loops  @xcite .",
    "the susy contributions to @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 parameters for the points selected in this analysis have been computed and are found to be all compatible with the lep measurements at 95% c.l .",
    ", as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stu ] .     scenario in the plane @xmath24 .",
    "the ellipses correspond to the lep allowed regions at 68% ( red ) and 95% ( blue ) c.l .",
    "@xcite . ]",
    "searches for susy particles in @xmath13 collisions have been conducted at various energies before lep . in particular , tristan operated at 52 @xmath25 57  gev , where @xmath16 pairs could be kinematically produced . however , due to the small coupling to the @xmath10 , the production cross section for @xmath26 is in the range 1.20.2  pb for 15 @xmath27 25  gev .",
    "we estimate the efficiency of the tristan analysis  @xcite by applying its selection cuts on the samples of @xmath26 generated with pythia 6.424  @xcite at @xmath28 57  gev .",
    "these selection criteria , based on the requirement of a total visible energy in excess of 10  gev , small sphericity and two reconstructed jets with large acoplanarity angle , have an efficiency estimated to be 0.03 , 0.20 and 0.41 for our pmssm points with a mass splitting , @xmath14 = 5 , 7 and 10  gev respectively .",
    "this result agrees with the efficiency values reported by the experiment  @xcite , i.e.  an efficiency in excess to 0.40 for @xmath14 = 13  gev and decreasing towards zero for @xmath14 below 8  gev . from these results",
    "we can conclude that , with a total data statistics of @xmath511  pb@xmath29 for tristan , no signal of these events could be obtained for points having @xmath30 7 .    at lep-2 ,",
    "the searches for @xmath26 pair production have excluded scalar bottom quarks up to @xmath3100  gev , with the exception of highly degenerate scenarios .",
    "the efficiency of the selection cuts applied in the lep-2 searches , mostly to reduce @xmath31 background has been tested on simulated events found to be @xmath30.15 at @xmath14 = 7  gev and @xmath320.10 at @xmath30 5  gev . since the typical @xmath26 production cross section at 200  gev is @xmath50.2  pb for 15 @xmath27 25  gev , this results in a product of signal cross section times efficiency of 0.03  pb and less for @xmath30 7  gev , which are therefore not excluded by the combined lep-2 searches . in summary ,",
    "scalar bottom quarks with 15 @xmath27 25  gev , small @xmath33 and mass splitting to the lightest neutralino @xmath34  gev are not excluded by direct scalar quark searches at @xmath13 colliders .    finally , the process @xmath35 is suppressed since the lightest neutralino , @xmath1 , is bino - like and the second lightest , @xmath36 , is wino - like .",
    "in general the @xmath36 can be chosen to be heavier then 200  gev , thus ensuring that the @xmath37 pairs could not be produced at lep-2 . but",
    "the process has a cross section of less than 0.1  fb , even when the process is kinematically accessible , as for the case @xmath38 = 150  gev , due to the coupling suppression .",
    "the mssm introduces several additional scalars , resulting in a more complex scalar potential . hence ,",
    "the stability of the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) configurations and the possibility of a tunnelling to other minima of the potential need to be checked . to address this question , which was not considered in  @xcite",
    ", we use the program vevacious  @xcite , which determines the global minimum of the one loop effective scalar potential for each mssm point .",
    "if the local minimum is global , the vacuum is stable .",
    "otherwise , the program computes the tunnelling time from the local to the global minimum .",
    "this should be compared to the age of the universe , excluding points for which the vacuum is short - lived .",
    "about 85% of the accepted pmssm points in our scenario have stable vacuum , 5% have a long - lived vacuum , and 10% have a short - lived vacuum .",
    "the results of direct detection experiments reporting possible excesses of signal - like events , correspond to a light wimp with large value of the scattering cross section .",
    "our pmssm scenario has a light @xmath1 and an almost degenerate @xmath2 with a mass splitting of order of the bottom mass .",
    "we observe that the calculation of the cross section for direct detection in such a scenario requires special care . in this specific regime",
    "the general effective lagrangian approach is not quite appropriate and requires a special treatment , for example treating the @xmath39 quark as a heavy quark throughout the full calculation , including the twist-2 terms .",
    "applying the default general formula , as used in micromegas adopted in our earlier study  @xcite , in the case where @xmath40 , may reveal a spurious pole that , erroneously , enhances the scattering cross section .",
    "@xcite has recently reconsidered the calculation of this cross section for the specific case considered here , based on the drees and nojiri ( dn ) treatment  @xcite .",
    "the scattering cross section obtained using the dn treatment implemented in darksusy 5.1.1 still provides us with a sizeable amount of pmssm points consistent with cdms and other data .",
    "the correlation of the neutralino relic density and the spin - independent @xmath41 scattering cross section is important , as highlighted in fig .",
    "[ fig : oh2 ] . in general",
    ", points with large scattering cross section correspond to small values of neutralino relic density , due to the fact that in this region , the splitting between the neutralino and the sbottom is small , resulting in an increased annihilation cross section .",
    "however , after applying all other constraints the points selected by the relic density have relatively high scattering cross section . in the following we consider both loose , @xmath42 , and tight , @xmath43 , neutralino relic density constraints .",
    "indirect detection experiments provide us with constraints on dm by analysing the cosmic ray fluxes .",
    "in particular , pamela @xcite , fermi @xcite , hess @xcite and ams-02 @xcite have detected excesses in the electron - positron spectra , while pamela has a precise measurement of the antiproton flux  @xcite which does not reveal any excess compared to predictions .",
    "fermi - lat has also released strong bounds from @xmath44-ray searches  @xcite .",
    "while the @xmath45 excesses could be interpreted in terms of dm , the general accepted explanation is in terms of astrophysical phenomena @xcite . here",
    ", we adopt the upper limit on the @xmath46 annihilation cross sections derived in @xcite as a constraint .",
    "the strongest limits on annihilation cross sections come from the fermi - lat @xmath44-ray searches . in our specific model with light neutralinos and light sbottoms , the main annihilation channel is either @xmath47 , mediated by a @xmath10 or higgs boson in @xmath48-channel , or by a sbottom in @xmath49-channel , or the 3-body decay @xmath50 .",
    "however , due to the suppressed couplings of the lightest neutralino to the @xmath10 and @xmath51 , the @xmath48-channel is suppressed and the annihilation cross section is expected to be small . in the wimp mass region of interest to our analysis , the strongest bound on the total annihilation cross sections times velocity is @xmath52 @xmath53/s , obtained by fermi - lat from gamma - flux measurements , while the upper bound on the @xmath54 cross - section is @xmath55@xmath53/s , obtained from pamela antiproton flux measurements @xcite .    -ray strongest upper limit on the @xmath56 and the pamela @xmath57 strongest upper limit on @xmath58 annihilation cross sections , respectively . ]",
    "we calculate annihilation cross sections with a modified version of micromegas , which includes the calculation of the @xmath59 cross - section .",
    "[ fig : id ] shows the correlation between the total annihilation cross section and the scattering cross section .",
    "again , we see that more points with large scattering cross sections are present in the region with large annihilation cross sections . also , most of the points are below the upper limit on the annihilation cross section .",
    "in addition to the constraints described in the previous subsections , we checked that the running of @xmath60 is not affected by the presence of light sbottoms since the gluino is heavy in our scenario  @xcite as also mentioned in  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we consider constraints from flavour physics and muon anomalous magnetic moment as detailed in table  [ tab : constraints ] , which summarises all constraints applied in our analysis .

    "nucleon spin - independent scattering cross section  @xcite as a constraint on the pmssm points .",
    "in order to test more precisely the sensitivity of these searches to our scenario , here we explicitly study the acceptance of @xmath61 jet , @xmath62 jet events by the cms mono - jet  @xcite and @xmath63 or @xmath10 events by the atlas single @xmath64 and @xmath10 boson  @xcite analyses performed on the 8  tev lhc data .",
    "we compute the cross section for @xmath65 using @xmath66 .",
    "we paid attention to include the full @xmath67 matrix elements , as the narrow width approximation is known to break down in the regions where the daughter particles are close in mass to the parent particle  @xcite , which is typically the case of a scalar bottom of @xmath68 gev decaying to a neutralino and bottom of @xmath310 and @xmath35 gev respectively . using",
    "the narrow width approximation would incorrectly increase the resulting cross sections by large factors and lead to erroneous conclusions in our scenario .",
    "signal samples in the jet , @xmath10 and @xmath64 + met are generated using madgraph 5 for a set of selected pmssm points , through the corresponding slha files .",
    "events are hadronised using pythia 8.150 with the cteq6l1 pdf set and then processed through delphes 3 to obtain the reconstructed physics objects for the subsequent analysis .",
    "the production cross section is @xmath30.5 - 0.2  fb for the case of @xmath61 jet and @xmath39 - 1  fb for @xmath69 events , depending on the neutralino mass .",
    "jets are reconstructed using the anti - kt algorithm with a distance parameter of 0.5 for the mono - jet search and the cambridge - aachen algorithm  @xcite with a radius parameter of 1.2 for the @xmath70 search , to reproduce the procedure of the original analyses .",
    "figure  [ fig : mono ] shows the correlation of the transverse momentum of the leading @xmath71 jet with the event met , where only jets with invariant mass in the range 50 to 120  gev are accepted for the @xmath69 analysis .",
    "the fraction of @xmath61 jet and @xmath64 or @xmath10 events fulfilling the loose ( tight ) signal cuts adopted in the original analyses is 4.5@xmath7210@xmath73 ( 1.2@xmath7210@xmath73 ) for the mono - jet search and 9.5@xmath7210@xmath8 ( 1.5@xmath7210@xmath8 ) for the @xmath69 search . comparing to the excluded product of production cross section and reconstruction efficiency for the cms and atlas analyses ,",
    "our pmssm points are well below the bounds established with 20  fb@xmath29 of 8  tev data .    in the case of the @xmath74 jet process , the cross sections for the selected pmssm points corresponding to our light @xmath2 scenario are significantly larger , but the efficiency of the cms analysis cuts is also smaller .",
    "we compute the cross section for the @xmath75 + jet using madgraph 5 and obtain values in the range 1000 to 200  pb for 11 @xmath27 35  gev . the efficiency for obtaining events with a hard jet with @xmath76 80  gev and met above 300 ( 350 )",

    "these small values of efficiency , depending on the extreme tail of the met distribution , need to be confirmed by a detailed detector simulation .",

    "[ fig : mn1ddoh2 ] shows the @xmath41 scattering cross section as a function of the @xmath46 mass for our selected pmssm points compared to the results of the direct detection experiments .",
    "these points , corresponding to the light neutralino , almost degenerate @xmath2 scenario are consistent with the recent planck result on the relic dm density , interpreted either as an upper limit on the neutralino relic density or as a tight constraint ( as defined in table  [ tab : constraints ] ) .",

    "it is remarkable that this appears to be the only scenario in the mssm with neutralino lsp providing us with a light neutralino lsp , with mass below 20  gev , and large wimp - nucleon scattering cross section .",
    "the large squark mixing angle @xmath9 , close to @xmath12 , makes the @xmath2 , mostly @xmath11 , almost degenerate with the @xmath1 lsp and reduces its coupling to the @xmath10 , thus ensuring compliance with the @xmath10 lineshape and the @xmath13 searches .",
    "on the basis of the result of the pmssm scans and fast simulation studies we have reported here a light neutralino with mass below @xmath81 gev is not yet experimentally excluded , as suggested by  @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy in the results is due to the different coverage of the pmssm parameter space of the two studies , in particular the fact that only scenarios with scalar quark masses larger than 100  gev are retained in the analysis of  @xcite .    .",

    "masses of the other susy particles can be pushed to large values without affecting the viability of the mssm solution for the constraints discussed in this paper .",
    "there are some important common features .",
    "first , the lsp is a bino - like neutralino of mass @xmath88 gev , and the nlsp is a @xmath2 mainly right - handed of mass @xmath89 gev .",
    "the @xmath36 and @xmath90 have masses @xmath91150  gev and are wino - like or mixed states depending on their masses .",
    "the mass of the lightest higgs is @xmath92 gev to agree with the lhc results and the @xmath1 has very strongly suppressed couplings to the higgs and @xmath10 bosons , while the @xmath2 couples only weakly to them .",
    "this ensures that the scenario is not excluded by electroweak data and it does not produce a significant invisible decay width of the @xmath10 and @xmath51 bosons . the branching ratio for the decay @xmath93 ranges from values as low as a few % up to 50% , or more .",
    "the @xmath94 and @xmath95 are constrained by the common value of third generation scalar quark masses in the pmssm and the @xmath94 contribution to the @xmath51 mass .",
    "still , the @xmath94 mass can be safely chosen to be above 600  gev , beyond the current reach of the lhc searches .",
    "we observe in passing that points in the region where the scalar top mass exceeds 700  gev generally fail the vacuum stability test , however this feature may be specific of the points obtained in our scans and heavier stop masses may be allowed for other choices of the pmssm parameters .",
    "the mssm offers solutions compatible with a light wimp and large scattering cross section , as suggested by cdms and other data , if the reported events are due to a dm signal .",
    "the light , almost degenerate sbottom scenario remains a viable solution when the constraints from @xmath13 experiments and from the latest lhc results are applied . in this scenario , a sizeable @xmath96 rate may provide a good opportunity for a test at the lhc once the @xmath97 decay will have been established and its signal strength measured with sufficient precision .",
    "interesting opportunities for dedicated searches of light sbottoms arise at lhc , in the @xmath39-jets + met , if the kinematical cuts can be lowered , and mono - jet channels as well as at a future @xmath13 collider and should be pursued , if the first , tantalising indications of possible signals from light dm at cdms and other experiments will be confirmed by new data .",
    "in general , there is an important interplay between dm and the higgs sector through the scattering wimp cross section , the neutralino relic density and the invisible higgs width , which needs to be systematically investigated in the coming years , as new results from dm direct detection and the lhc experiments will become available .",
