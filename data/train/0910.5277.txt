    "the importance of tensor interactions on nuclear many - body problems was recognized more that 50 years ago .",

    "when a proton and a neutron are aligned in the direction of spins , the deuteron gets an extra binding energy by the tensor interaction , v_t = f(r)s_12 since @xmath6 is negative and @xmath7=2 . on the other hand ,",
    "if a proton and a neutron are perpendicular to the spin direction , the deuteron will loose the binding energy since @xmath8 and can not make a bound state .",

    "summary is given in section 5 .",
    "the tensor force was considered in the skyrme - landau parameterization and the sum rules of electromagnetic transitions in ref .",
    "however , the tensor force was essentially dropped in most skyrme parameter sets which have been used widely in nuclear structure calculations .",
    "recently , in ref .",
    "@xcite , a skyrme interaction was fitted including the tensor contribution . then , tensor terms were added perturbatively in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite to the existing standard parameterizations siii  @xcite and sly5  @xcite , respectively .",

    "@xcite and used for systematic investigations within the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) framework .",
    "the inclusion of tensor terms in the skyrme hf calculations achieved considerable success in explaining some features of the evolution of single - particle states  @xcite .",

    "it should be noticed that the exchange part of the central skyrme interaction gives the same kind of contributions to the total energy density .",
    "the central exchange and tensor contributions give the extra terms to the energy density as @xmath19 the spin - orbit potential is then expressed to be u_s.o.^(q ) = w_02r ( 2d_qdr + d_1-qdr ) + ( + ) .",

    ", width=453 ]    before going to detailed study , let us mention two important features of the tensor and the central exchange contributions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dw ] ) to the spin - orbit splitting .",
    "first point is that the mass number dependence of the the first and second terms in eq.([eq : dw ] ) . since the skyrme spin - orbit force @xmath24 gives the spin - orbit splitting proportional to the derivatives of the densities , the mass number dependence is very modulate in heavy nuclei . on the other hand , the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dw ] ) depends on the spin density @xmath25 which has essentially no contribution for the @xmath26s closed shell",
    ". the spin density will increase exactly proportional to the number of particles in the open shells if one of the spin - orbit partner is only active .",
    "moreover , the sign of the @xmath25 will change depending upon which orbits are involved in the active shell orbits , i.e. , the orbit @xmath27 gives a positive @xmath25 value while the orbit @xmath28 gives a negative @xmath25 .",
    "this means that the spin - orbit energy will change in the opposite direction according to which orbit is occupied in the open shell nuclei .",
    "we fit the two parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( equivalently @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) using the recent experimental data of @xmath3182 isotones and @xmath32 isotopes .",
    "we keep the central part of skyrme interaction as that of sly5 .",
    "the central exchange interactions are @xmath33=80.2mev@xmath34@xmath35 and @xmath3648.9 mev@xmath34@xmath35 for sly5 . the optimal parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 are determined to be ( @xmath29 , @xmath37170,100)mev@xmath34@xmath35 .",
    "we examine detailed properties of the tensor interactions by using our parameter sets . in fig .",
    "[ fig : a2 ] , we consider a nucleus where the last occupied orbit is the neutron @xmath38 ( for example , imagine @xmath1zr or @xmath39ca ) . in .",
    ", the @xmath29 increase the spin - orbit splitting because of positive @xmath40 of @xmath38 orbit , while @xmath30 has the opposite sigh and decrease the splitting for positive @xmath40 .",
    "these effects are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : a2 ] where the neutron spin - orbit splitting is increased , while the proton one is decreased .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : z50 ] , the energy differences for proton single - particle states @xmath41 of z=50 isotones are shown as a function of the neutron excess @xmath42 .",
    "the original sly5 interaction fails to reproduce the experimental trend qualitatively and quantitatively .",
    "firstly , the energy differences of the hf results are much larger than the empirical data .",
    "secondly , the experimental data decrease , the neutron excess decreases and reach about 0.5mev at the minimum value . on the other hand , the energy differences of the original sly5 increase as the neutron excess decrease and has the maximum at around @xmath42=20 .",
    "we studied also several other skyrme parameter sets and found almost the same trends as those of sly5 .",
    "the tensor central exchange interactions are included in the results marked by open circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : z50 ] .",
    "we can see a substantial improvement by introducing the tensor interactions .",
    "the set ( @xmath29 , @xmath37170,100)mev@xmath34@xmath35 gives a fine agreement with the empirical data from @xmath43 quantitatively and qualitatively .",
    "comparison of energy difference between pairs of single - particle 1g@xmath44 and 1h@xmath45 proton states of z=50 isotones .",
    "the calculations are performed with and without tensor and central exchange terms in the spin - orbit potential ( [ eq : dw ] ) top of sly5 parameter set .",
    "the experimental data are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite . see the text for details .",
    ", width=453 ]    the hf+tensor results can be qualitatively understood by general argument as follows .",
    "firstly , the strength @xmath46 change the depth of the proton spin orbit potential . for z=50 core",
    ", only the proton g@xmath47 proton orbit dominates the spin density @xmath48 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sd ] ) so that with the negative @xmath29= value the spin - orbit splittings are increased .",
    "thus , the @xmath49 protons increase the spin - orbit splitting between proton @xmath50 orbits and that of proton @xmath51 orbits by @xmath29 effect . as a net effect ,",
    "the @xmath41 protons decreases substantially .",
    "next let us study the ( n - z ) dependence where @xmath52 plays the essential role .",
    "in the case of @xmath41 protons on z=50 core from n - z=(6 - 14 ) , the @xmath53 neutron orbit is gradually filled .",
    "then the @xmath52100mev@xmath34@xmath35 gives a negative contribution to the spin - orbit potential ( [ eq : dw ] ) and increases the spin - orbit splitting .",
    "therefore the energy difference @xmath41 is further decreasing . from n@xmath54z=(14 to 20 ) , the @xmath55 and @xmath56 neutron orbits are occupied . in this region",
    "the spin density is not so much changed since @xmath55 has zero contribution . for n - z=(20 - 32 ) ,",
    "the h11/2 orbit is gradually filled .",
    "then this orbit gives a positive contribution to the spin - orbit potential ( [ eq : dw ] ) , i.e. , the the spin - orbit splitting is decreasing .",
    "then the @xmath57 turns out to be increasing .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath58 term determines the slope of the ( n - z ) dependence so that a larger @xmath58 gives a steep slope .",
    "comparison of energy difference between pairs of single - particle 1i@xmath59 and 1h@xmath47 neutron states of n=82 isotopes .",
    "the calculations are performed with and without tensor and central exchange terms in the spin - orbit potential ( [ eq : dw ] ) top of sly5 parameter set .",
    "the experimental data are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite . see the text for details .",
    ", width=453 ]    for the results of sb - isotones in fig .",
    "[ fig : n82 ] , the @xmath60 e@xmath61 for n=82 core is plotted as a function of neutron excess .",
    "essentially , the same argument can be applied for the neutron energy difference @xmath60 e@xmath62 for n=82 core as that for the @xmath60 e@xmath61 for z=50 core .",
    "the last occupied neutrons in @xmath63 increase the neutron spin - orbit splitting so that the @xmath60 e@xmath61 become substantially smaller by the @xmath29 effect in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dw ] ) .",
    "the isotope dependence is again explained by the @xmath30 effect .",
    "the 1g@xmath44 and 2d@xmath64 are almost degenerate above the last occupied proton orbit 1g@xmath47 of z=50 core .",
    "the two proton orbits , @xmath65 and @xmath53 , have opposite effects on the spin orbit potential ( [ eq : dw ] ) . the occupation probability is larger for larger @xmath66 orbit so that 1g@xmath44 plays more important role on the spin orbit potential due to the tensor interaction in nuclei with ( n - z)=(32 - 18 ) for n=82 isotones . namely the neutron spin orbit splitting is larger for these isotones so that the @xmath67 orbit is down and the @xmath68 is up .",
    "these changes make the energy gap @xmath60 e@xmath62 smaller for the nuclei from ( n - z)= 32(@xmath69sn ) to ( n - z)=18(@xmath70gd ) .",
    "thus the role of the triple - even and triplet - odd tensor interactions are clearly shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : z50 ] and [ fig : n82 ] for both proton and neutron spin - orbit splittings .",
    "the role of the tensor interaction due to the @xmath58 term is essentially expected from the discussion by blatt - weisskopf @xcite for the deuteron .",
    "the role of @xmath29 is new and has not been examined in a quantitative way in the mean field calculations since this term comes from the triplet - odd tensor interaction .",
    "the triplet - odd tensor interaction was not included in the studies of refs .",
    "recently , brown et al . studied the skyrme - type tensor interactions in @xmath69sn and @xmath71sn based on the parameter set skx .",
    "they took both the positive and negative @xmath29 values in the hf calculations and concluded that the negative @xmath29 value gives a better agreement with the experimental data .",
    "this is consistent with the present systematic study of z=50 isotopes and n=82 isotones with hf+bcs model .",
    "there has been no rpa or qrpa ( quasiparticle random phase approximation ) program available to study the effect of the tensor terms on the excited states of nuclei until very recently .",
    "the tensor terms of the skyrme effective interaction was firstly introduced in the self - consistent hf plus rpa calculations  @xcite , in particular , in the gt transitions , which should be affected because of the fact that the corresponding operator is spin - dependent . in the study of gt transitions ,",
    "the quenching problem is of some relevance .",
    "the experimentally observed strength from 10 to 20 mev excitation energy ( with respect to the ground state of the target nuclei ) is about @xmath72 of the model - independent non - energy weighted sum rule ( newsr ) @xcite .",
    "it would be very interesting to study whether the tensor force has an effect in shifting the strength already at one particle - one hole ( 1p-1h ) level .",
    "coupling the gt with two particle - two hole states is essential to describe the resonance width but it is not expected to affect strongly the position of the main gt peak ; the effect of the tensor force in connection with the 2p-2h coupling was studied in ref  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath25 gives essentially no contribution in the spin - saturated cases .",
    "therefore , we choose @xmath1zr and @xmath2pb as examples to be calculated .",
    "@xmath1zr is a proton spin - saturated nucleus , with a spin - unsaturated neutron orbit @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath2pb is chosen as it is not saturated either in protons or neutrons .",
    "the two examples should allow elucidating separately the role of triplet - even and triplet - odd terms .",
    "since the tensor force is spin - dependent and affects the spin - orbit splitting , the spin mode is very likely to receive strong influence .",
    "the operator for gt transitions is defined as @xmath74 in terms of the standard isospin operators , @xmath75 . in the charge - exchange rpa ,",
    "the @xmath76 and @xmath77 channels are coupled and the corresponding eigenstates emerge from a single diagonalization of the rpa matrix .     the gt@xmath78 strength in @xmath1zr and @xmath2pb .",
    "the rpa results are displayed , by smoothing them with lorentzian function having 1 mev width .",
    "as explained in the text , result labeled by 00 corresponds to neglecting the tensor terms in both hf and rpa ; 10 corresponds to including the tensor terms in hf but neglecting them in rpa ; finally , 11 corresponds to including the tensor terms in both hf and rpa .",
    "the arrow denotes the experimental energy .",

    ", width=529 ]    the gt@xmath78 strength distributions in @xmath1zr and @xmath2pb are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:208pb - gt ] .",
    "the calculated results are smoothed by averaging the sharp rpa peaks with lorentzian function weighting function having 1 mev width .",
    "the tensor force affects these results in two ways .",
    "firstly , it changes the single - particle energies ( s.p.e . ) in the hf calculation ; secondly , it contributes to the rpa residual force .",
    "we do three different kind of calculations to analyze separately these effects . in the first one , the tensor terms are not included at all . in the second one",
    ", we include tensor terms in hf but drop them in rpa .",
    "this calculation is not self - consistent , but it displays the effects of changes in single - particle energies on the strength distribution . in the last one , the tensor terms are included both in hf and rpa calculations . for simplicity ,",
    "results of the three categories of calculations are labeled by 00 , 10 and 11 , respectively .",
    ".values of the newsr @xmath79 and ewsrs @xmath80 for @xmath1zr and @xmath2pb in different excitation energy regions .",
    "the two - body spin - orbit interaction is included in hf but neglected in rpa calculation .",
    "the results labeled by 00 correspond to neglecting the tensor terms both in hf and rpa ; 10 corresponds to including the tensor terms in hf but neglecting them in rpa ; 11 corresponds to including the tensor terms both in hf and rpa .",
    "see the text for a discussion of the effects of the tensor terms .",
    "[ table2 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we have evaluated the amounts of newsr @xmath79 and ewsr @xmath80 in different excitation energy regions , and listed them in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "the ewsr in the energy region below 30 mev ( where the one particle - one hole transitions are located ) is decreased , after the inclusion of the tensor term . from table",
    "[ table2 ] , we also see that an appreciable amount of ewsr is shifted from the lower energy region ( 0 - 30 mev ) to the higher energy region ( 30 - 60 mev ) by including tensor terms in hf plus rpa calculations .",
    "we also calculated the values of newsr in the 0 - 30 mev and 30 - 60 mev energy regions for @xmath1zr and @xmath2pb .",
    "when the tensor is not included in the residual interaction ( i.e. , the calculations labeled by 00 and 10 ) , the values of newsr in the energy region between 30 - 60 mev for both @xmath1zr and @xmath2pb are small only few percent of the newsr(fig ,  [ fig:208pb - gt ] . but in the case 11 , about @xmath4 of newsr is shifted from the lower energy region to the higher energy region ( corresponding 25% and 29% of ewsr in @xmath1zr and @xmath2pb , respectively ) .",
    "moreover , we can see that essentially no unperturbed strength appears in this region ( see the fig .",
    "[ fig:208pb - gt ] ) .",
    "this means that including tensor terms in simple rpa calculation shifts about @xmath4 of the gt strength to the energy region 30 - 60 mev . while 2p-2h couplings will increase further these high energy strength",
    ", we would like to stress that the tensor correlations move substantial gt strength from the low energy region 0 - 30 mev to the high energy region 30 - 60 mev even within the 1p-1h model space .",
    "in @xmath1zr , one can notice that the gt strength is concentrated in two peaks in the region below 30 mev .",
    "there are only two important configuration involved which are @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( see the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:208pb - gt ] ) .",
    "when the tensor term is included only in hf and neglected in rpa , the centroid in the energy region of 0 - 30 mev are moved upwards by about 1.5 mev , and the high energy peak at @xmath83 is moved upwards by only 0.5 mev , as compared with the results without tensor term .",
    "when the tensor term is included both in hf and rpa , the centroid of the gt strength in the energy region 0 - 30 mev is moved downwards by about 1 mev , and the high energy peak is moved downwards about 2 mev , as compared with the results obtained without tensor term . including tensor terms in rpa makes the two main separated peaks closer ( this situation also happens for @xmath39ca ) .",
    "this result can be attributed from the hf and rpa correlations of the tensor term .",
    "when the @xmath84 orbit is filled by neutrons , the tensor correlations give a quenching on the spin@xmath54orbit splitting between @xmath85 and @xmath86 orbits so that the unperturbed energies of the two main @xmath87 configurations  @xmath82 and @xmath81 are closer in energy as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:208pb - gt ] .",
    "the rpa results in fig . [ fig:208pb - gt ] with labeled by ( 00 ) and ( 10 ) reflect these changes of hf single particle energies due the tensor correlations and the energy difference between two peaks is narrower . in @xmath2pb , from the right panel of fig [ fig:208pb - gt ] we see that the gt strength is concentrated in two peaks in the low energy region of 0 - 30mev for all 00 , 10 and 11",
    ". there are eleven important configurations which do contribute to these peaks .",
    "when the tensor terms are only included in hf and neglected in rpa , the centroid of these peaks is moved upwards about 0.5 mev , and the higher energy peak at e@xmath8818mev is also raised by about 0.8 mev .",
    "when the tensor terms are included in both hf and rpa calculation , the centroid of these peak moves downward by about 1.5 mev , and the higher energy peak moves also downwards by about 3.3 mev , compared with the result obtained without tensor terms . by including tensor terms in rpa calculation ,",
    "the gt strengths in the energy region of 30 - 60 mev are increased substantially by the shift of the strength in the energy region of 0 - 30 mev through the tensor force .",
    "we study the effect of tensor correlations on single - particle and collective states within skyrme hartree - fock and rpa model .",
    "firstly , we study the role of tensor interactions in skyrme effective interaction on the isospin dependence of spin - orbit splittings in n=82 isotones and z=50 isotope . the different role of the triplet - even and triplet - odd tensor forces is elucidated by analyzing the spin - orbit splittings in these nuclei . the experimental isospin dependence of these splittings can not be described by hf calculations with standard skyrme forces , but is very well accounted for when the tensor forces are introduced .",
    "the gt excitations in @xmath1zr and @xmath2pb in the hf plus rpa framework with a skyrme interaction siii .",
    "if the tensor term is included in both hf and rpa , the centroid of g - t strength in the energy region below 30 mev is moved downwards by about 1 mev for @xmath1zr and 3.3 mev for @xmath2pb . at the same time , the dominant peak at e@xmath8916mev(18mev ) in @xmath1zr(@xmath2pb ) is also moved downwards by about 2 mev(3mev ) .",
    "it is pointed out for the first time that about @xmath4 of newsr is moved in the high energy region of 30 - 60 mev by the tensor correlations in rpa even within @xmath90 model space .",
    "it was pointed out recently that the high energy gt strength is shifted by the coupling between gt ana spin - quadrupole states due to the tensor correlations which has the intrinsic strong coupling @xcite it is interesting to point out that the main gt peak , contrarily , gets the energy shift downward because of the peculiar feature of the tensor correlations .",
    "the tensor interaction is spin - dependent , so we expect that it can have important effects not only on the gt transitions , but on spin - dipole and other spin dependent excitation modes as well .",

    "<S> firstly , we study the role of tensor interactions in skyrme effective interaction on the spin - orbit splittings of n=82 isotones and z=50 isotope . the isospin dependence of the shell structure is well described as the results of the tensor interactions without destroying good properties of the binding energy and the rms charge radii of the heavy nuclei . secondly , we performed self - consistent hf+rpa calculations for charge exchange 1@xmath0 states in @xmath1zr and @xmath2pb to elucidate the role of tensor interactions on spin dependent excitations . </S>",
    "<S> it is pointed out that gamow - teller(gt ) states can couple strongly with the spin - quadrupole ( sq ) 1@xmath0 states in the high energy region above e@xmath3=30 mev due to the tensor interactions . as the result of this coupling , more than @xmath4 of the gt strength </S>",
