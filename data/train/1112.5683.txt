    "many social , biological and communication systems can be described as networks with nodes denoting individuals and edges representing interactions among them .",
    "edges in many networks do not only indicate the existence of interactions , but also have associated with weights to record the interacting strengths .",
    "examples are numerous , including the scientific collaboration networks where the edge weight between two scientists depends on the number of co - authorized papers and the number of authors in each of these papers @xcite , the airport networks with edge weight representing the number of flights @xcite or the number of available seats @xcite between two airports , the food webs where edge weight can be defined by interaction frequency , by carbon flow or by interaction strength @xcite , the cell - phone communication networks with weight being assigned as the total number of calls or the total duration of calls @xcite , the world trade web where the edge weight accounts for the exports over gdp of the exporting country @xcite , and so on .    weight distribution has remarkable effects on the properties of dynamical processes taking place on top of networks , such as synchronization @xcite , transportation and routing @xcite , evolutionary game @xcite , cascading failure @xcite , diffusion @xcite , control @xcite , condensation @xcite , and so forth .",
    "epidemic spreading in weighted networks has also been considered in the literature @xcite .",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied a susceptible - infected ( si ) model on weighted scale - free networks and found that the heterogeneous weight distribution will slow down the spreading .",
    "therefore , given the topology and mean infectivity , the epidemic spreads fastest in unweighted networks .",
    "@xcite investigated the same dynamical process upon weighted scale - free networks with community structure , and showed that the weights of edges among different communities have higher impacts than those of edges inside communities .",
    "@xcite further studied the susceptible - infected - recovered ( sir ) model and found that the weight distribution has considerable impacts on both epidemic threshold and prevalence .",
    "@xcite considered the contact process in weighted scale - free networks , in which the weight of an edge connecting two higher - degree nodes is relatively small .",
    "@xcite further proved that in the contact process , the epidemic prevalence can be maximized by setting the egde weight inversely proportional to the degree of receiving node .",
    "mean - field approximation is a powerful tool to analyze dynamical processes on networks .",
    "in particular , the so - called heterogeneous mean - field approximation has achieved great success in predicting threshold of epidemic spreading in scale - free networks @xcite . however",
    ", this method may fail to capture the behavior of some dynamical processes in the thermodynamic limit @xcite and can not account for the fluctuations caused by quenched structure @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we study epidemic spreading in homogeneous networks with heterogeneous weight distribution , and develop an edge - based mean - field approximation .",
    "simulation results indicate that the more homogeneous the weight distribution is , the higher the epidemic prevalence is .",
    "this phenomenon can be quantitatively reproduced by the edge - based mean - field solution .",
    "in contrast , the node - based mean - field solution is insensitive to the change of weight distribution , and it tends to overestimate the epidemic prevalence .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "the model will be introduced , including how to construct networks , how to generate weight distributions , as well as the details of spreading dynamics . in section 3 ,",
    "the edge - based mean - field solution will be presented , while for comparison , the node - based mean - field solution will be introduced in the appendix .",
    "section 4 compares the simulation results and analytical solutions and give an explanation about why the edge - based mean - field solution is more accurate than the node - based one .",
    "eventually , we draw the conclusion , emphasize the advantages of the present method and discuss its potential relevance and applications in the last section .",
    "to emphasize the effects caused by the weight distribution , we concentrate on the regular random networks where edges are added in a completely random matter and the degree of every node is fixed as @xmath0 . in this way , the impacts of local clustering and heterogeneity in network topology can be eliminated .",
    "we investigate two sets of weight distributions . in the former case , the weight of each edge is the average of @xmath1 elements independently drawn from the uniform distribution @xmath2 .",
    "when @xmath3 , the weight distribution @xmath4 is exactly the same as @xmath2 , and @xmath4 will become more homogeneous with the increasing of @xmath1 , following the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 stands for the normal distribution , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the mean value and standard deviation of the uniform distribution @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "figure 1(a ) illustrates example distributions for @xmath9 and 10 .    in the latter case ,",

    "each node is in one of two discrete states , either susceptible ( s ) or infected ( i ) . at each time step",
    ", each infected node will select one of its neighbors to contact with .",
    "the selection probability is proportional to the edge weight .",
    "if the selected neighbor has been infected already , nothing happens , while if it is susceptible , with probability @xmath14 , it will be infected and then turn to be i - node in the next time step .",
    "meanwhile , each infected node will become susceptible in the next time step with probability @xmath15 .",
    "we assume that each infected node can contact only one neighbor per time step since in real social networks even an individual may have many friends , her could only interact with a very limited number of them whatever by physical contacts or by information communication @xcite .",
    "the analytical results can be obtained by the markov chain equations about the evolution of edge states . for every edge in the network ,",
    "there are three possible states depending on its two ends , say ss , si and ii . with an edge - based mean - field hypothesis",
    ", we assume that edges with the same weight distribute uniformly in the network .",

    "we denote @xmath27 the probability that a susceptible node connecting to an ss - edge with weight @xmath16 will become an infected node during the time step @xmath22 , then for a susceptible node connecting to an si - edge with weight @xmath16 , the probability it will be infected during the time step @xmath22 is @xmath28\\left[1-\\frac{w}{(k-1)\\langle w\\rangle+w}\\lambda\\right]$ ] , where @xmath29 is the mean weight .",

    "figure 5 provides an evidence that could , to some extent , explain the advantage of edge - based mean - field approximation . even for the case",
    "@xmath3 corresponding to the most homogeneous weight distribution discussed in this article , the densities of edge states change with the weight @xmath16 .",
    "this will become even more remarkable when the weight distribution gets broader .",
    "the edge - based mean - field solution ( see figure 5b ) can quantitatively capture the weight - dependent state densities ( see figure 5a ) .",
    "this figure also clearly points out the causation of the failure of node - based mean - field approximation , that is , the ignorance of the different density of edge states at different weights .",
    "to solve the sis model on weighted regular random networks , this paper proposed an edge - based mean - field method , which outperforms the traditional node - based method and can quantitatively reproduce the simulation results .",
    "both analytical solution and simulation results show that the more homogeneous weight distribution leads to higher epidemic prevalence .",
    "the main shortcoming of the mean - field approximation in network analysis is its disability in capturing the fluctuations caused by quenched structure .",
    "compared with the traditional node - based mean - field method @xcite , more accurate solutions could possibly be obtained by extending the analyzed units from nodes to edges , form edges to 3-order subgraphs , and so on .",
    "the mean - field approximation for correlated networks @xcite , to some extent , can be considered as an elegant example in this direction since the degrees of two ends of an edge are simultaneously considered .",
    "the present work also goes in such direction , but it directly considers the heterogeneity of edge weights instead of that of node degree .",
    "the present method could definitely find applications in analyzing dynamical processes on weighted networks , such as cascading , voting model , evolutionary game , transportation , etc .",
    "however , in reality , both node degrees and edge weights can be highly heterogeneous , and neither of the traditional node - based mean - field approximation nor the present edge - based mean - field approximation is able to give very accurate predictions .",
    "how to integrate these two methods is still an open issue .",
    "this work is partially supported by the national natural science foundation of china under grant number 90924011 , and the fundamental research funds for the central universities .",
    "denoting @xmath72 the number of susceptible individuals at time step @xmath22 and @xmath73 the average density of si - edges associated with a randomly chosen susceptible node , the number of si - edges and ss - edges are @xmath74 therefore , the density @xmath73 can be written as @xmath75 denoting @xmath68 the density of infected individuals , according to the mean - field approximation , @xmath76 when @xmath77 .",
