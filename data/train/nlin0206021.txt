    "in this chapter , we review the normal form theory developed in @xcite for weakly nonlinear and weakly dispersive wave equations where the leading order equation is given by the kdv equation in an asymptotic perturbation sense . the chapter is based on the report @xcite and the master thesis of the first author at osaka university .",
    "a series of lectures was carried out by the second author in the euro summer school 2001 held at the isaac newton institute , cambridge for august 12 - 25 , 2002 .",
    "the lecture started with a brief summary of the poincar - dulac normal form theory for a system of ordinary differential equations @xcite .",
    "the main point in the lecture is to present the normal form theory for _ near _ integrable system where the leading order system is given by a nolinear wave equation .",
    "this may be considered as an infinite dimensional extension of the poincar - dulac normal form theory .",
    "the basic technique of the normal form theory based on the lie transformation can be formally extended to the infinite dimensional case .",
    "unfortunately the convergence theorem of the normal form series has no extension to the present theory .",
    "however one should emphasize that the leading order in the present theory is given by a nonlinear equation , and it is not clear how one define a resonant surface for the leading order equation .",
    "this may provide a good problem for a future project .",
    "let us briefly summarize a background of the normal form theory for near integrable systems of nonlinear dispersive equations .",
    "it is well - known that for a wide class of nonlinear dispersive wave equations , the leading order nonlinear equation in an asymptotic expansion turns out to be given by an integrable system , such as the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation in weak dispersion limit and the nonlinear schrdinger equation in strong dispersion limit ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that most of the nonlinear dispersive wave equations are integrable at the nontrivial leading orders in an asymptotic sense .",
    "then a natural question is to ask how the higher order corrections affect to the integrability of the leading order equations . in @xcite , the effect of the higher order corrections on one - soliton solution of the kdv equation",
    "was studied , and it was shown that the velocity of soliton is shifted by the secular terms in the higher order terms . those secular terms or resonant terms",
    "are given by the symmetries of the kdv equation .",
    "the nonsecular terms then contribute to modify the shape of soliton",
    ". however the multi - soliton interactions were not studied in that paper . in @xcite , the normal form for weakly dispersive equations",
    "was first introduced up to the second oreder corrections , and it was found that the integrable approximation can be extended beyond the kdv approximation but not to the second order .",
    "this obstacle to the _ asymptotic _ integrability plays no rule for one - soliton solution , but provides a crucial effect for two soliton interactions .",
    "this was found in @xcite .",
    "the obstacles are defined as the nonexistence of the integrals of perturbed equation in the form of the power series in a small parameter .",
    "this was also recognized as the nonexistence of approximate symmetries of the perturbed equation @xcite .",
    "( the normal form for strongly dispersive wave equations has been also studied in @xcite . ) then in @xcite , the effect of the obstacle on the interaction of two soliary waves was studied for the regularized long wave equation ( although the method can apply to other equations of weakly dispersive system ) .",
    "an inelasticity due to the obstacle was found , and it leads to the shifts of the soliton parameters and a generation of a new soliton as well as radiations through the interaction .    in this lecture , we present a comprehensive study of the normal form theory for weakly dispersive wave equations : we start in section 2 to define the perturbed kdv equation as an asymptotic expansion of a weakly dispersive wave equation whose leading order equation is given by the kdv equation . we give a recursion formula to generate the higher order corrections which may be obtained by an asymptotic perturbation method ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the set of those higher order terms forms an extended space of differential polynomials which includes some nonlocal terms .",
    "the space is denoted by @xmath0 , where oddimplies the weight of the polynomial .    in section 3 ,",
    "the conserved quantities or integrals of the kdv equation are reviewed , and we discussed approximate integrals of the perturbed kdv equation .",
    "we then obtain the conditions for the existence of approximate integrals in each order ( proposition [ pro : conservation ] ) .",
    "we also discuss a connection of the conserved quantities and the @xmath1-soliton solutions of the kdv equation .    in section 4 , we review the symmetries of the kdv equation , and discuss the approximate symmetries for the perturbed kdv equation . here",
    "we also define the space of @xmath2 , which together with @xmath0 provides the appropriate spaces for the normal form transform defined in the next section .    in section 5 , we describe the normal form theory .",
    "the normal form transformation is then obtained by a linear equation of an adjoint map defined as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the kdv vector field .",
    "the explicit form of the normal form is given for the perturbed kdv equation which contains the first three lowest weight approximate conserved quantities ( proposition 5.1 ) .",
    "the normal form then admits one - soliton solution of the kdv equation , which confirms the result in @xcite .",
    "we also discuss the gardner - miura transformation which is an invertible version of the miura transformation , and show that the inverse gardner - miura transformation is nothing but the normal form transformation after removing the symmetries of the kdv equation ( proposition 5.2 ) .    in section 6 ,",
    "we consider the interaction problem of two solitary waves , and provides the explicit formulae for the shifts of the soliton parameters ( proposition 6.1 ) .",
    "we also give the formulae of the radiation energy and additional phase shifts which are used to compare with the numerical simulations for some examples in the next section .    finally in section 7",
    ", we present explicit examples including ion acoustic wave equation , the boussinesq equation as a model of shallow water waves and the regularized long wave equation .",
    "we show the good agreements with the results obtained by the normal form theory .",
    "we also consider a 7th order hirota bilinear equation which admits an exact two soliton solution but is known to be nonintegrable .",
    "we look for an obstacle to the asymptotic integrability , and find that the obstacles appear at the fourth order .",
    "this implies that the forth order obstacles play no rule for two soliton solution , just like all obstacles has no rule for one - soliton solution for the system with the first three approximate integrals .",
    "under the assumption of weak nonlinearity and weak dispersion , the wave propagation in a one - dimensional medium can be described by the kdv equation in the leading order of an asymptotic expansion . using an appropriate asymptotic perturbation method ( e.g. see @xcite )",
    "one can show that the higher order correction to the kdv equation has the following expansion form with a small parameter @xmath5 with @xmath6 , @xmath7 where @xmath8 gives the kdv flow and the higher order corrections @xmath9 are generated by a recursion formula starting from @xmath10 , @xmath11 here @xmath12 are the real constants determined by the original physical problem , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 indicates an integral over @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "each @xmath17 is a monomial in the polynomial @xmath9 , and @xmath18 is the total number of independent monomials of the order @xmath19 .",
    "the first few terms of @xmath9 are then given by @xmath20 we normalize the kdv flow so that @xmath8 is given by the standard form which we denote by @xmath21 , i.e. @xmath22 each polynomial @xmath23 has the scaling property : assign the weight 2 to @xmath24 , and 1 to @xmath25 .",

    "the integrability of the kdv equation implies the existence of an infinite number of conserved quantities or integrals . here",
    "we briefly summarize those quantities , and discuss the approximate integrals for the perturbed equation ( [ eq : pkdv ] ) .",
    "the approximate integrals will play a fundamental role for the nomal form theory discussed in section [ snormalform ] , and provide an analyical tool to study the nonitegrable effect on the solution of the perturbed kdv equation .",
