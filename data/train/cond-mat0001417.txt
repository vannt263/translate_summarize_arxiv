    "one of the first continuous systems to be studied by computer simulations@xcite is the system of hard disks interacting with the two body potential , @xmath4 where , @xmath0 ( taken to be @xmath5 in the rest of the paper ) the hard disk diameter , sets the length scale for the system and the energy scale is set by @xmath6 . despite its simplicity@xcite , this system was shown to undergo a phase transition from solid to liquid as the density @xmath7 was decreased .",
    "the nature of this phase transition , however , is still being debated .",
    "early simulations  @xcite always found strong first order transitions . as computational power increased the observed strength of the first order transition progressively decreased ! using sophisticated techniques lee and strandburg  @xcite and zollweg and chester  @xcite found evidence for , at best , a weak first order transition .",
    "a first order transition has also been predicted by theoretical approaches based on density functional theory@xcite . on the other hand , recent simulations of hard disks  @xcite by jaster , using as many as @xmath8 particles find evidence for a continuous , kosterlitz -thouless -halperin -nelson -young ( kthny ) transition@xcite from liquid to a hexatic phase , with orientational but no translational order , at @xmath9 .",
    "nothing could be ascertained , however , about the expected hexatic to the crystalline solid transition at higher densities because the computations became prohibitively expensive .",
    "the solid to hexatic melting transition was estimated to occur at a density @xmath10 . a priori , it is difficult to assess why various simulations give contradicting results concerning the order of the transition . in this paper",
    "we take an approach , complementary to jaster s , and investigate the melting transition of the solid phase .",
    "we show that the hard disk solid is unstable to perturbations which attempt to produce free dislocations leading to a solid @xmath11 hexatic transition in accordance with kthny theory@xcite .",
    "though this has been attempted in the past@xcite , numerical difficulties , especially with regard to equilibration of defect degrees of freedom , makes this task highly challenging .",
    "we also show that this transition lies close to a , first order , solid to liquid melting line .",
    "we calculate quantitatively the relative positions of the first order and the kthny transitions in the parameter space for this system and explain why earlier simulations failed to arrive at a consensus .",
    "the coarse grained density of a crystalline solid can be expanded as , @xmath12 , where ( * g * ) is a reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "the order parameters @xmath13 are _ complex _ , @xmath14 and the displacement vector @xmath15 is the deviation of an atom from the nearest perfect lattice point @xmath16 .",
    "if fluctuations of the amplitude of @xmath13 can be neglected then a solid can be described in terms of @xmath17 alone - the fundamental assumption of elasticity theory .",
    "the elastic hamiltonian for hard disks is given by , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the bulk modulus .",
    "the quantity @xmath20 is the `` effective '' shear modulus ( the slope of the shear stress vs shear strain curve ) and @xmath21 is the pressure .",
    "the hard disk solid , being a purely repulsive system , is always under a uniform hydrostatic pressure @xmath22 at any density @xmath7 .",
    "the lagrangian elastic strains are defined as , @xmath23 where the indices @xmath24 go over @xmath25 and @xmath3 and finally , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .    in general",
    "a solid possesses two types of excitations , `` smooth '' phonons and `` singular '' dislocations , respectively .",
    "long wavelength phonons inhibit long range order in 2-d solids so that the intensity of a bragg reflection peak @xmath28 , where the debye waller factor @xmath29 ( @xmath30 is the lattice parameter and @xmath31 the number of spatial dimensions ) diverges and order parameter correlations decay algebraically - an example of quasi long ranged order ( qlro ) .",
    "we know that singular excitations , like dislocations , can drive a qlro @xmath11 disorder transition ( where correlations decay exponentially )",
    ". this situation has been analysed by the kthny theory  @xcite .",
    "the kthny- theory  @xcite is presented usually for a 2-d triangular solid under _ zero external stress_. it is shown that the dimensionless young s modulus of a two - dimensional solid , @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the lam constants , depends on the fugacity of dislocation pairs , @xmath35 , where @xmath2 is the core energy of the dislocation , and the `` coarse  -graining '' length scale @xmath36 . this dependence is expressed in the form of the following coupled differential equations ( the recursion relations ) for the renormalization of @xmath37 and @xmath3 : @xmath38 , \\\\",
    "\\nonumber \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial l } & = & ( 2 - \\frac{k}{8 \\pi})y+2 \\pi y^2   e^{\\frac { k}{16 \\pi}}i_0(\\frac{k}{8 \\pi } ) .",
    "\\label{kthny}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are bessel functions .",
    "the thermodynamic value is recovered by taking the limit @xmath41 .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "( 1 ) that the trajectories in @xmath3-@xmath37 plane can be classified in two classes , namely those for which @xmath42 as @xmath41 ( ordered phase ) and those @xmath43 as @xmath41 ( disordered phase ) .",
    "these two classes of flows are separated by lines called the separatrix .",
    "the transition temperature @xmath44 ( or @xmath45 ) is given by the intersection of the separatrix with the line of initial conditions @xmath46 and @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "at the transition point the flow follows the separatrix so that the _ renormalized _",
    "@xmath37 jumps from @xmath49 to @xmath50 at the transition .",
    "the ordered phase corresponds to the solid ( no free dislocations ) and the disordered phase is a phase where free dislocations proliferate .",
    "proliferation of dislocations however _ does not _ produce a liquid , rather a liquid crystalline phase called a `` hexatic '' with quasi- long ranged ( qlr ) orientational order but short ranged positional order .",
    "second _ k - t transition destroys qlr orientational order and takes the hexatic to the liquid phase by the proliferation of `` disclinations '' ( scalar charges ) .",
    "apart from @xmath44 there are several universal predictions from kthny- theory , for example , the order parameter correlation length and susceptibility has essential singularities ( @xmath51 ) near @xmath44 .",
    "all these predictions can , in principle , be checked in simulations@xcite .",
    "note that , in order to use the kthny- theory to study the solid- hexatic transition in hard disks we have to bear in mind that for the hard disk solid , which is always under a uniform hydrostatic pressure @xmath22 , the effective shear modulus @xmath52 has to be used in the definition@xcite of @xmath37 .    the kthny- theory predicts when a 2-d solid becomes unstable to the proliferation of dislocations . however , there is a second possibility .",
    "the free energy of the liquid may become higher than that of the stable solid at a density smaller than that where the hexatic phase is recorded .",
    "this leads to a first order transition and a jump in density at the liquid  -solid coexistence pressure ( for simulations in the @xmath53- ensemble ) instead of an intermediate hexatic phase .",
    "often it is very difficult to distinguish the two possibilities as the history of simulation studies of hard disks shows .",
    "this is further complicated by the fact that kthny theory also predicts that the specific heat , or equivalently , in the case of the hard disk system , the compressibility , shows a smooth bump leading to a near flat region in the pressure  -density diagram . in fig .",
    "( 2a ) we show the conventional situation where the dotted line designates the often observed first order transition . in fig .",
    "( 2b ) we show jaster s results where it is seen that instead of a flat region in the @xmath21-@xmath7- curve or a maxwell loop usually associated with a first order transition one gets instead a smooth bending over to a state with a high compressibility .",
    "finite size effects which would be present in the first- order case are negligible .",
    "this would indicate the presence of a liquid- hexatic transition .",
    "the question of solid to hexatic transition is still open . it is worth noting that detailed finite size scaling of orientational order in this system  @xcite is not necessarily in contradiction to this result",
    ".    why do simulations of hard disk solids find it so difficult to see a solid- hexatic transition ?",
    "one of the reasons is , of course , the divergence of the correlation length as the system approaches the transition so that one requires large systems .",
    "this is complicated by the fact that in order to obtain equilibrated values of the dislocation density ( @xmath54 ) one also needs very large simulation times because in a high density solid the diffusion of defects is very slow@xcite . to illustrate this point",
    "we have attempted to calculate the defect density of a hard disk solid in a monte carlo simulation .",
    "we perform conventional monte carlo simulations in the nvt ensemble with an usual metropolis updating scheme for @xmath55 particles .",
    "we choose a single density @xmath56 ; a sequence of initial states are then constructed by adding extra complete rows of atoms ( thereby increasing the density to @xmath57 ) and removing an equal number of atoms from the bulk at random . in equilibrium , these extra vacancies in the bulk should diffuse out and the lattice parameter adjust to fill in the gap .",
    "after about one million monte carlo steps we calculate the number of five coordinated ( @xmath58 ) and seven coordinated ( @xmath59 ) atoms .",
    "since our system can not have free vacancies ( due to our choice of ensemble ) we expect in equilibrium @xmath60 .",
    "the simulations at each @xmath61 is repeated for ten realizations of the initial state .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "we see that @xmath62 ( except for the trivial case of @xmath63 ) , the difference growing with @xmath61 as expected , and the statistical errors are very large .",
    "we therefore conclude that even for a relatively small system of @xmath64 particles , the equilibration of defects ( vacancies in this case ) is an extremely slow process .",
    "so it should not come as a surprise that brute force simulations of the hard disk solid fail to produce the true equilibrium phase .",
    "it may also happen , on the other hand , that kthny- theory fails due to the following reasons .",
    "firstly , elastic theory itself may fail near the transition , so that amplitude or long wave length phonon fluctuations may destabilise the solid producing a continuous transition . though remote ,",
    "this possibility has nevertheless been discussed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "secondly , perturbation theory in @xmath3 may break down because @xmath2 is too small ( i.e. @xmath3 too large ) at the transition .",
    "saito  @xcite and strandburg  @xcite showed using lattice discretized versions of a dislocation hamiltonian that kthny perturbation theory breaks down if @xmath65 at the transition . in our simulations of the hard disk system",
    "we check _ both _ these possibilities as well as the possibility of a first order transition .    in the next section",
    "we discuss our simulations together with our method for computing elastic constants and core energies .",
    "we use these inputs to check for a first order transition and a kthny- scenario in section  iii .",
    "we summarise and conclude this work in section  iv .",
    "one way to circumvent the problem of large finite size effects and slow relaxation due to diverging correlation lengths is to simulate a system which is constrained to remain defect ( dislocation ) free and , as it turns out , without a phase transition .",
    "relatively small systems simulated for short times therefore yields thermodynamically accurate data in this limit .",
    "surprisingly , we show that using this data it is possible to predict the expected equilibrium behaviour of the unconstrained system .",
    "it is worth mentioning that with an approach similar in spirit to the one followed here , we have obtained excellent results for the kosterlitz  -thouless transition in the two  -dimensional planar rotor model@xcite , which has served as an important model in the development of the kthny theory  @xcite , after the proofs of the low temperature susceptibility divergence in this model  @xcite and the existence of phase transitions without local order parameters in general  @xcite were given .",
    "we simulate @xmath66 hard disks in an ( almost ) square box .",
    "we have also simulated two additional systems of @xmath67 and @xmath68 particles in order to look for residual finite size effects .",
    "our algorithm follows closely the usual metropolis scheme for simulating hard disks .",
    "the simulation is always started from a perfect triangular lattice which fits into our box ",
    "the size of the box determining the density .",
    "once a regular mc move is about to be accepted , we perform a _",
    "delaunay triangulation involving the moved disk and its nearest and next nearest neighbors .",
    "we compare the connectivity of this delaunay triangulation with that of the reference lattice ( a copy of the initial state ) around the same particle . if any old bond is broken and a new bond formed ( fig .",
    "( 4 ) ) we reject the move since one can show that this is equivalent to a dislocation  - antidislocation pair separated by one lattice constant involving dislocations of the smallest burger s vector . note that , ( i ) only dislocation pairs of smallest burger s vector are eliminated , dislocations of higher topological charge cost higher energy and may not be relevant at the densities where a melting transition is usually observed ; ( ii ) other fluctuations e.g. long wavelength phonon fluctuations and fluctuations of the amplitude of the order parameter ( spontaneous production of voids in the system ) are not eliminated as long as they preserve connectivity .",
    "the fraction of moves @xmath69 which are rejected because they violate the constraint is stored .",
    "next , we need a method to calculate elastic constants accurately in our simulations making sure that we extrapolate to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "such a method has been recently developed by us and discussed in detail elsewhere@xcite .",
    "below we include a brief description for completeness .",
    "since we have a dislocation free system , we can always associate an ideal , static , `` reference '' lattice point @xmath16 with every hard disk all through the simulation and calculate @xmath70 . microscopic strains @xmath71 can be calculated now for every reference lattice point @xmath16 .",
    "next , we coarse grain ( average ) the microscopic strains within a sub - box of size @xmath72 , @xmath73 and calculate the ( @xmath72 dependent ) quantities , @xmath74    the sub - blocks may be constructed by simply dividing the entire box of size @xmath75 into integral number of smaller boxes , as done in this calculation so that @xmath76 an integer , or multiple sub - boxes of arbitrary size @xmath77 can be constructed within the simulation cell , as in ref.@xcite .",
    "lastly , quantities in the thermodynamic limit are obtained by fitting data to the form ,    @xmath78                          + { \\cal o}(x^4).\\ ] ] where the index @xmath79 the function , @xmath80 is defined as , @xmath81 @xmath82 is a bessel function and @xmath83 is the correlation length for the @xmath84- correlations .    the elastic constants in the thermodynamic limit are obtained from , the set : @xmath85 and @xmath86 . the last two equations for @xmath52 serve as a stringent internal consistency check and yields an accurate error estimate for this quantity .",
    "there are two ways to obtain the fluctuations @xmath87 for every sub - block size @xmath72 in eq .",
    "one can either accumulate @xmath88 directly or construct histograms of the block strains @xmath89 and obtain @xmath90 by fitting gaussian profiles to the normalized probability distributions of @xmath89 for every block size @xmath72 .",
    "again this constitutes another excellent consistency check and a measure of the statistical uncertainties involved .",
    "we accumulate data till all these uncertainties are less than a percent .",
    "residual finite size effects obtained by repeating the entire procedure for @xmath91 and @xmath92 particles for a few densities are also seen to be within the same limit of accuracy .",
    "there are several distinct advantages of our method : in general our method works for any system for which instantaneous configurations can be obtained ( for example either from other simulations or from real experiments ) .",
    "we obtain directly the finite size scaled results from a single simulation . as discussed above",
    "there are a number of stringent internal consistency checks which can be used to obtain very accurate data . in spite of this our method",
    "is easy to use and the computational complexity is not more than calculating for eg .",
    "pair correlation functions .",
    "this method can be easily adapted for calculating local strains and stresses in _ inhomogeneous _ situations .",
    "our results for the elastic moduli , the pressure and the fraction of moves , @xmath69 , rejected due to the topological constraint discussed above are given in table i as a function of density . in fig .",
    "( 5 ) , we compare our results for the bulk and shear moduli with the data of two previous simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "we also compare our simulation results to estimates from free volume theory@xcite in the simplest , independent cell approximation . within this approach",
    "the helmholtz free energy per particle is given by @xmath93 , where the available free volume , @xmath94 and the close packed density @xmath95 .",
    "other thermodynamic quantities can be obtained by successive differentiation , viz .",
    "@xmath96 where @xmath97 and we have used the cauchy relation , strictly valid only for a harmonic solid@xcite , for our estimate of the effective shear modulus @xmath52 .",
    "note that the free volume elastic moduli and the pressure diverge@xcite as @xmath98 .",
    "we see that our bulk modulus interpolates smoothly from the free volume values at high densities to those of ref .",
    "@xcite at low densities .",
    "overall , the differences between the three sets of data are small .",
    "our values for the shear modulus agrees well with the free volume results at high density , but at low densities they are smaller than all other estimates though close to those of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "once the elastic constants are obtained we can analyze in detail the two competing scenarios viz .",
    "first order solid- liquid transition or kthny- transition to the hexatic phase .",
    "first of all , we should point out that our constrained simulations allow us to obtain elastic constants up to a density as low as @xmath99 , far below the density @xmath100 where the transition to the liquid is expected to occur@xcite , which implies that amplitude and phonon fluctuations can not destabilize the solid .",
    "so an ordinary second order transition is ruled out .",
    "however , there can always be a first order transition if the free energy of the liquid becomes lower than that of the perfect solid .    in order to investigate this question",
    "we obtain the equation of state @xmath22 and the gibbs free energy @xmath101 of the liquid and the solid .    to obtain the equation of state of the liquid we use the semi  -empirical , accurate , analytical form by santos _",
    "_  @xcite , which is in excellent agreement with computer simulation data@xcite .",
    "the pressure is given by , @xmath102 where the packing fraction @xmath103 and @xmath104 is the packing fraction at close packing .",
    "the helmholtz free energy per particle , @xmath105 where the ideal gas helmholtz free energy per particle @xmath106 .",
    "the gibbs free energy @xmath101 is then obtained by the standard legendre transformation , @xmath107 .",
    "in addition we use the data of jaster  @xcite in the transition region to obtain a revised estimate of the free energy .",
    "this is done by fitting jaster s data for @xmath22 to a polynomial for @xmath108 which matches the results of santos _ et .",
    "@xcite for @xmath109 . from this equation of state",
    "we can obtain the helmholtz and hence the gibbs free energy by integrating starting from the value given by eq.(7 ) at @xmath110 .",
    "the equation of state for the solid is obtained by integrating our bulk modulus values using the result of bladon and frenkel  @xcite at @xmath111 as the reference pressure ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "the gibbs free energy is obtained by further integration again using the result obtained for the free energy in ref .",
    "@xcite at @xmath111 as a reference ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "the possible ( first order ) transitions can be located by equating the gibbs free energies .",
    "the slope discontinuity gives the ( inverse ) density difference of coexisting phases .",
    "we find immediately , that all the free energies have very similar slopes ( see fig .",
    "6 ) so that any possible first order transition would have only a small jump in the density .",
    "it also implies that small errors in the free energy of our reference state makes a large difference in the co - existence pressure .",
    "we have therefore reduced the reference free energy by a small amount ( @xmath114 ) so that the coexisting pressure @xmath115  the value found in most recent simulations@xcite .    using the semi - empirical free energy of santos _",
    "@xcite we obtain a ( meta stable ) first order transition with @xmath116 and @xmath117 as observed in early simulations@xcite .",
    "of course , this estimate of @xmath118 is only a lower bound , as the theory of ref.@xcite is expected to overestimate the free energy .",
    "the free energy from jaster s data is lower and almost completely parallel to that of the solid suggesting a very weak first order transition if at all . in this case",
    "we get a slope difference @xmath119 ( viz . @xmath120 and @xmath121 ) - well within our numerical accuracy ( fig . 6 ) .",
    "next , we analyze our results in the light of the kthny- theory@xcite .",
    "the _ unrenormalized _",
    "@xmath122 at @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) ( see fig .",
    "( 2 ) , lower arrow ) which implies that a weak first order transition from solid to liquid preempts a kthny- solid- hexatic transition .",
    "however , the value of @xmath37 is renormalized by the presence of dislocations .",
    "we can estimate the extent of this renormalization from our data .",
    "the dislocation pair probability @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the `` internal partition function '' of a dislocation pair and is given by@xcite , @xmath127 where we have set the core radius @xmath128 , the lattice parameter .",
    "the core energy of a dislocation is a difficult quantity to obtain from a simulation , though it has been attempted in the past@xcite . in our case ,",
    "an ansatz , which gives excellent results in the 2d- xy- model  @xcite , and identifies the rejection ratio @xmath69 as @xmath129 can be used to obtain @xmath2 , see fig .",
    "( 7 ) . throughout the relevant region",
    "@xmath2 is safely above the limit @xmath130  @xcite . at the transition the @xmath131 which is in good agreement the results of murray and van winkle  @xcite ( @xmath132 ) from experiments on 2-d charge stabilised colloids and of zahn _ et .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath133 ) for paramagnetic colloids .    finally , to obtain the melting density we use the unrenormalised @xmath37 and @xmath47 as inputs to the kthny recursion relations ( eqs.(4 ) ) and solve them numerically by a standard euler discretization to obtain @xmath134 , see fig .",
    "the melting density obtained from our value for @xmath134 is @xmath135 and @xmath136 ( fig .",
    "( 2 ) , upper arrow ) .",
    "this means that the kthny- transition now preceeds the first order transition and the solid transforms to the hexatic phase .",
    "we have simulated a dislocation free triangular solid of hard disks using a constrained monte carlo algorithm . using a block analysis scheme we calculate the finite size scaled elastic constants of this solid . from the number of times",
    "the system attempts to violate our no- dislocation constraint we can obtain ( virtual ) dislocation probabilities and hence the core energy .",
    "the absence of a phase transitions in our system implies that all correlation lengths remain finite and the problem of slow equilibration of defect densities is eliminated . in effect",
    "we obtain highly accurate values of the unrenormalized coupling constant @xmath37 and the defect fugacity @xmath3 which can be used as inputs to the kthny recursion relations . numerical solution of these recursion relations then yields the renormalized coupling @xmath134 and hence the density and pressure of the solid to hexatic melting transition .",
    "we can draw a few very precise conclusions from our results .",
    "firstly , a solid without dislocations is stable against fluctuations of the amplitude of the solid order parameter and against long wavelength phonons .",
    "so any melting transition mediated by phonon or amplitude fluctuation is ruled out in our system .",
    "secondly , the core energy @xmath137 at the transition so kthny perturbation theory is valid though numerical values of nonuniversal quantities may depend on the order of the perturbation analysis .",
    "thirdly , solution of the recursion relations shows that a kthny transition at @xmath136 _ preempts _ the first order transition at @xmath138 .",
    "since these transitions , as well as the hexatic  -liquid kthny transition lies so close to each other , the effect of , as yet unknown , higher order corrections to the recursion relations may need to be examined in the future@xcite . due to this caveat",
    ", our conclusion that a hexatic phase exists over some region of density exceeding @xmath100 still must be taken as preliminary .",
    "also , in actual simulations , cross over effects near the bicritical point , where two critical lines corresponding to the liquid  -hexatic and hexatic  -solid transitions meet a first order liquid  -solid line ( see for e.g. ref.@xcite for a lattice model where such a situation is discussed ) may complicate the analysis of the data , which may , in part , explain the confusion which persists in the literature on this subject . in systems with softer potentials@xcite , the signature of a kthny transition appears to be more pronounced@xcite . in future",

    "<S> elastic moduli and dislocation core energy of the triangular solid of hard disks of diameter @xmath0 are obtained in the limit of vanishing dislocation- antidislocation pair density , from monte carlo simulations which incorporates a constraint , namely that all moves altering the local connectivity away from that of the ideal triangular lattice are rejected . in this limit , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the solid is stable against all other fluctuations at least upto densities as low as @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> our system does not show any phase transition so diverging correlation lengths leading to finite size effects and slow relaxations do not exist . </S>",
    "<S> the dislocation pair formation probability is estimated from the fraction of moves rejected due to the constraint which yields , in turn , the core energy @xmath2 and the ( bare ) dislocation fugacity @xmath3 . using these quantities , we check the relative validity of first order and kosterlitz  -thouless  -halperin  -nelson  -young ( kthny ) melting scenarios and obtain numerical estimates of the typical expected transition densities and pressures . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that a kthny transition from the solid to a hexatic phase preempts the solid to liquid first order transition in this system albeit by a very small margin , easily masked by crossover effects in unconstrained `` brute  - force '' simulations with small number of particles . </S>"
