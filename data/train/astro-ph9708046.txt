    "prior to the launch of _ asca _ , the paradigm for seyfert 1 galaxies , was that the 210  kev regime can be well represented by a powerlaw continuum of ( photon ) index @xmath7 ( e.g. nandra & pounds 1994 ) .",
    "spectra obtained using the large area counter ( lac ) onboard _ ginga _ also revealed emission line features superimposed on this underlying primary continuum attributable to fe @xmath6-shell fluorescence in the 6.47.1  kev band .",
    "a flattening of the spectra was observed above @xmath8 10 kev thought to be the compton - reflection hump. evidence for a @xmath6-shell absorption edge in the 7.18.9  kev band due to highly - ionized fe was also reported in a number of cases ( nandra & pounds 1994 ) .",
    "the combination of these features offers an explanation as to why simple powerlaw models to the data obtained by earlier instruments typically revealed flatter ( @xmath9 ) spectra ( e.g. turner & pounds 1989 ) .",
    "there are a few exceptions to this rule , most notably ngc  4151 which exhibits a continuum noticeably flatter than the average ( @xmath10 ) and absorption within a substantial column of gas ( @xmath11 ) along the line of sight covering most ( but possibly not all ) of the central continuum ( e.g. yaqoob , warwick , pounds 1993 and references therein ) .",
    "this picture has been generally supported by _ asca _",
    "observations , with the addition that the higher spectral resolution afforded by the onboard instruments have shown the fe @xmath12 line to be significantly broadened ( mushotzky et al .",
    "1995 ; tanaka et al 1995 ) .",
    "however , the situation in the soft ( @xmath13  kev ) x - ray regime is somewhat less clear . historically , a confusing variety of spectral and temporal properties have been seen and/or implied in seyfert 1 galaxies in the soft x - ray regime .",
    "a number of sources seemed to show a steep and rapidly variable soft excess which could be characterised by either a low - temperature thermal component ( e.g. arnaud et al . 1985 ) or a steep second powerlaw ( e.g. turner & pounds 1989 ; turner , george & mushotzky 1993 ) .",
    "data obtained using the solid - state spectrometer ( sss ) onboard the _ einstein observatory _ showed evidence for a complex spectral form in the soft x - ray regime ( turner et al 1991 ) , in some cases this was thought to be due to leakage of the primary continuum through a patchy absorber ( e.g. reichert et al . 1985 ) .",
    "evidence for absorption by ionized material along the line - of - sight to active galactic nuclei ( agn ) was first obtained in observations of the qso mr2251 - 178 . using data from the monitor proportional counter ( mpc ) onboard",
    "the _ einstein observatory _ , halpern ( 1984 ) reported the column density in this source to have increased by a factor @xmath14 between two observations separated by @xmath15 yr .",
    "the excess flux observed in a subsequent observation using the high resolution imager ( hri ) on the _ einstein observatory _ led halpern to suggest an explanation in terms of material with a column density @xmath11 , but photoionized such as to be transparent below the @xmath6-edge of ovii at 740  ev .",
    "such an interpretation was strongly supported by _",
    "exosat _ observations of mr2251 - 178 .",
    "pan , stewart & pounds ( 1990 ) found an inverse correlation between the inferred column density and the source flux , and demonstrated that this was consistent with the behaviour expected from photoionized material along the line - of - sight .",
    "similar behaviour was observed in ngc  4151 ( fiore , perola & ramano 1990 ; yaqoob & warwick 1991 ) and mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ( nandra , pounds & stewart 1990 ) , establishing the effect for low and high luminosity sources . supporting evidence for such `` warm absorbers ''",
    "was provided by _",
    "ginga _ observations of emission - line agn which revealed iron @xmath6-shell features in some sources , suggestive of an origin in ionized material with columns densities @xmath16 .",
    "nandra & pounds ( 1994 ) find this to be a common occurrence , with 12 out of 27 sources in their sample of seyfert 1 galaxies and narrow emission line galaxies ( nelgs ) showing such a component .",
    "however , the low spectral resolution of _ ginga _ meant that the results were likely to be sensitive to the assumptions concerning the adjacent fe @xmath6-shell emission line .",
    "confirmation of the existence of warm absorbers came from _ rosat _ position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) observations , which revealed absorption edges attributable to ionized oxygen in numerous sources ( e.g. mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , nandra & pounds 1992 ; 3c351 , fiore et al .",

    "1994 , reynolds et al .",
    "1995 ; ngc  3783 , george , turner & netzer 1995 ) immediately confirmed the pspc results and showed evidence for warm absorbers in many other sources ( e.g. ngc  3227 , ptak et al 1994 ; ngc  4051 , mihara et al 1994 ; guainazzi et al 1996 ; exo  055620 - 3820.2 , turner , netzer & george 1996 ; mrk  290 , turner et al 1996 ; pg1114 + 445 , george et al .",
    "furthermore reynolds ( 1997 ) finds evidence for such a component in at least half of a sample of _ asca _ observations of 24 type-1 agn .",
    "the presence of highly - ionized , absorbing gas instrinsic to seyfert 1 nuclei is further confirmed by the presence of associated absorbers seen in the uv in many sources .",
    "discussion of these observations and the attempts to relate the uv and x - ray absorbers made to - date is postponed to ",
    "[ sec : xuvabso - disc ] .",
    "comparison of _ asca _ data with the predictions of detailed photoionization calculations have revealed spectroscopic evidence for a second ionized absorber in ngc  3516 ( kriss et al .",
    "in addition the absorption edges due to ionized oxygen appear to vary in a way which is inconsistent with the behaviour of a single absorber in at least some sources . in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ,",
    "the depth of the oviii edge changes on a timescale @xmath17  s with no corresponding change in the ovii edge ( reynolds et al 1995 ; otani et al .",
    "1996 ) , whilst the converse is true in ngc  4051 ( guainazzi et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the presence of emission lines at energies @xmath18  kev has been suggested in a number of previous observations ( e.g. turner et al 1991 ) .",
    "a blend of emission lines due to ovii ( 0.5680.574  kev ) has been claimed in the _ asca _ data from ngc  3783 ( george , turner & netzer 1995 ) and potentially seen in other sources ( e.g. ic  4329a , cappi et al .",
    "however the reality of such features has since been disputed , because of the realization of specific inadequacies in the low energy calibration of the _ asca _ instrumentation ( see  [ sec : calib_uncert ] ) .    here",
    "we present the third in a series of papers describing the x - ray properties of a sample of 18 seyfert 1 galaxies , using data obtained by _",
    "asca_. the sample is comprised of 23 _ asca _ observations of seyfert class 1.01.5 galaxies ( as defined by whittle 1992 ) performed prior to 1994 may 01 . in nandra",
    "et al . ( 1997a , hereafter paper  i ) , we presented imaging and timing data for this sample . in that paper",
    "we demonstrate that all of the sources show evidence for variability on timescales of minutes - hours , with an amplitude anti - correlated with the source luminosity , confirming previous results .",
    "we also showed that for a number of sources the variability amplitude is greater in soft x - rays ( @xmath19  kev ) than in hard x - rays ( for 10 of the 18 sources on timescales of @xmath15",
    "hr ) . in nandra",
    "et al . ( 1997b , hereafter paper  ii ) , we presented the 310 kev spectra of the sample sources , and found 14 out of the 18 sources to contain an iron @xmath20 line which is resolved in the _ asca _ sis , with mean width @xmath21  kev for a gaussian profile .",
    "however , we found many of the line profiles to be asymmetric , suggesting an origin from the innermost regions of the putative accretion disk .    in this paper , we present the 0.6 - 10.0 kev spectra of the sample sources .",
    "the extension of the spectral analysis down to 0.6 kev requires consideration of the properties of the circumnuclear absorbing material as well as any steepening of the spectrum at low energies .",
    "we present detailed modelling of absorption by photoionized material and discuss likely emission contributions as well as combinations of several emission and absorption components .",
    "we present the range of properties applicable to our sample , and discuss the characteristics and statistics of the ionized absorbers .",
    "we also consider the the importance of allowing a fraction of the underlying continuum to be unattenuated by ionized gas , and the inclusion of the emission features expected from the ionized material .",
    "as will become apparent below , there is an obvious variation in signal - to - noise ratio between different datasets and hence there are variations in detectability of the ionized gas . as in the two previous papers our intention is to study the mean properties of the sample and we only include detailed notes on individual sources as an appendix .",
    "we describe the observations and data reduction in  [ sec : anal ] , and the photoionization models in  [ sec : ion_model ] .",
    "our spectral fitting procedure is introduced in  [ sec : procedure ] , and the results presented in  [ sec : basic_models ] and  [ sec : additional_models ] . in  [ sec : disc - multi ] we discuss the objects for which there in more than one observation within our sample .",
    "our results are discussed within the general context of the physical properties agn in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we sumarize our overall findings in  [ sec : open_issues ] along with outlining a number of important issues that remain to be resolved .",
    "the _ asca _ satellite consists of four identical , co - aligned x - ray telescopes ( xrts ; serlemitsos et al .",
    "two solid - state imaging spectrometers ( known as sis0 and sis1 ) , each consisting of four ccd chips , sit at the focus of two of the xrts , and provide coverage over the @xmath80.410  kev band ( burke et al .",
    "two gas imaging spectrometers ( known as gis2 and gis3 ) sit at the focus of the other two xrts , and provide coverage over the @xmath80.810  kev band ( ohashi et al .",

    "further details on the satellite , its instrumentation and performance can be found in tanaka , inoue & holt ( 1994 ) , makishima et al .",

    "our sample is listed in table  1 along with the redshift ( @xmath22 ) of the source , the axial ratio ( @xmath23 ) of the host galaxy , the effective galactic hydrogen column density along that line - of - sight ( @xmath24 ) as derived from 21  cm measurements , a number of parameters indicative of the multiwaveband spectra of the objects , and x - ray luminosity in two bands .",
    "the mean flux at 220  nm ( @xmath25 ) in the rest - frame of the source , and the mean ratio of the flux at 125  nm ( rest - frame ) to @xmath26 for observations carried out within 48 hours of each other from the _ iue _ observations were calculated from courvoisier & paltani ( 1992 ) .",
    "the errors quoted for @xmath27 and @xmath25 are 1@xmath28 or 10% , whichever is the larger , and datasets flagged dubious by courvoisier & paltani were excluded .",
    "the observed flux at 2  kev ( @xmath29 ) in the rest - frame of the source is from the best - fitting model presented in  [ sec : basic_models ] ( in all cases the statistical error is larger than the differences in @xmath29 between different models ) . in the case of objects for which we have more than one dataset , @xmath29 is the exposure - weighted mean .",
    "the radio  to  optical _ energy _ spectral index , @xmath30 , is calculated using @xmath25 and the observed flux at 5  ghz from veron - cetty & veron ( 1993 ) .",
    "the optical  to  x - ray _ energy _ spectral index , @xmath31 , is calculated using @xmath25 and @xmath29 . it should be stressed that these values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 are based non - simultaneous observations and hence should be regarded with appropriate caution .",
    "the errors associated @xmath30 and @xmath31 are rather difficult to determine without estimates of the typical amplitude of variability ( on timescales of months  years ) in each band . unfortunately , such amplitudes are not well determined for most of the objects considered here .",
    "however even assuming a factor 5 variability in each of the three bands ( which is likely to be an overestimate in the radio and optical bands ) , for the typical values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 derived for these objects , one obtains relatively small errors of @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively .",
    "finally , table  1 gives the derived luminosities and @xmath36 are used throughout ] of the underlying continuum ( i.e. correcting for all line  of  sight absorption ) in the ( rest - frame ) 0.110  kev ( @xmath37 ) and 210  kev ( @xmath38 ) bands . as in the case of @xmath29 , these are calculated from the best - fitting model presented in  [ sec : basic_models ] , and are exposure - weighted means in the case of objects with multiple datasets . all fluxes and luminosities quoted for the sources will be derived using the sis0 detector .      the selection criteria and data analysis methods are presented in paper  i. in summary , we have used data from the us public archive at nasa / gsfc .",
    "standard criteria were applied to reject poor quality data and source spectra extracted using the ftools / xselect package for each instrument .",
    "background spectra were extracted from source - free regions of the instrument .    in brief , we consider only the gain - corrected ( pulse invariant or pi ) channels for each instrument .",
    "furthermore , here we consider only the time - averaged spectrum for each instrument during each observation in order to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the raw spectra were grouped such that each resultant channel had at least 20 counts per bin , permitting us to use @xmath39 minimization in the spectral analysis .",
    "all such fits were undertaken using the xspec ( v9.01 ) spectral analysis package ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "appropriate data redistribution matrices were used ( those released 1994 nov 09 for the sis , and those released on 1995 mar 06 for the gis ) .",
    "the effective area appropriate for each dataset was calculated using ` ascaarf ` ( v2.5 ) .",
    "this does not include a parameterization of the azimuthal dependence of the point spread function which can cause inaccuracies in the normalization , particularly in the case where the source region is not circular .",
    "uncertainties in determining the source centroid can also result in normalization errors , and discrepancies remain between the absolute flux - calibration of the four instruments .",
    "these factors lead to cross - calibration uncertainties between the four instruments , but as the point - spread function of the xrt is not strongly dependent on energy , we do not expect them to introduce distortions into the individual spectra .",
    "we therefore chose to fit the spectra from all four instruments simultaneously , but allowed the normalization of that model to be free for each detector .",
    "for the datasets considered here , the two sis detectors typically agree in flux to within @xmath813% .",
    "the normalization of the gis detectors are currently forced to agree with the average of the sis detectors for the crab .",
    "the observing log is presented in table  2 , where the utc calendar date is for the start of the observation . as in papers",
    "i & ii , we refer to each observation using the name of the source and , in cases where there are multiple observations , the observation number in brackets ( using the same numbering scheme as in papers  i & ii ) . table  2 contains the exposure time ( @xmath40 ) , the count rate ( @xmath41 ) in the 0.610  kev band , and the total number of photons in the 0.65.0  kev and 7.010  kev bands , for sis0 ( only ) after all screening criteria have been applied ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "also listed in table  2 are the the total number of spectral bins ( @xmath43 ; for all instruments ) used in the analysis , and the additional number of good - quality spectral bins in sis0 and sis1 below 0.6  kev ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the latter two quantities enable the reader to judge the goodness - of - fit for the results of the spectral analysis presented below .",
    "finally in table  2 we also provide references to work published previously on each observation .",
    "we wish to fit several spectral features observed in the 0.410 kev range .",
    "however , there is known to be some uncertainty in the low energy calibration of _ asca _ that must be addressed first . while the origin of this problem is currently unclear ( gendreau , p.comm ) , the manifestation of the problem is in the lowest channels of the sis data . specifically , the _ asca _ guest observer facility at nasa / gsfc reports that sis spectra from a variety of objects of different astronomical classes consistently indicate uncertainties in the xrt / sis effective area at energies @xmath45 kev , and especially around 0.5 kev .",
    "this has been mainly due to the inability to interpret soft x - ray features in the spectra from 3c  273 ( the sis / gis cross - calibration target ) . however , recent simultaneous observations of 3c  273 with _ asca _ and _ bepposax _ may improve this situation , and already indicate that the systematic error of the sis relative to the low - energy concentrator system ( lecs ) on _ bepposax _ may be no more than @xmath46 ( parmar et al 1997 ) .",
    "further details on the low - energy calibration of the sis are given in dotani et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and from the _ asca _ gof at nasa / gsfc    thus , here we have chosen to ignore all data below 0.6  kev during the spectral analysis , although we do compare the extrapolation of the various best - fitting models below 0.6  kev as a diagnostic of the quality of the fit ( see  [ sec : acceptability ] ) .",
    "for the purpose of this paper , we do not use the 5.07.0  kev band data in the fitting process , the consistency of those data with the fits is discussed later .",
    "this approach avoids any requirement to include a complex parameterization of the iron k - shell line profile in our consideration of the fits to the broad - band continuum shape .",
    "thus the spectral analysis was performed on simultaneous fits to the 0.65.0 , 7.010.0  kev data .",
    "this provides the best method of determining the broad - band x - ray continua .",
    "( note that in all figures presented below which display data / model ratios , the corresponding ratios are included for the 0.4 - 0.6 kev and 5.0 - 7.0 kev ranges to illustrate where these data lie with respect to the corresponding model ) .",
    "the ionized absorber / emitter models used in this paper were generated using the photoionization code ion ( netzer 1993 , 1996 , version ion95 ) to calculate the physical state of a slab of gas when illuminated by an ionizing continuum .",
    "the code includes all important excitation and ionization processes , full temperature and radiative transfer solutions , and emission , absorption and reflection by the gas are calculated self - consistently assuming thermal and ionization equilibrium . since the gas temperature is well below the equilibrium plasma temperature , only a few transitions affect the cooling , all of which are included .",
    "we assume an ionizing continuum typical of an agn with a blue bump .",
    "specifically we assume the weak ir case of netzer ( 1996 ) , with a _ photon _ index @xmath47 in the optical / uv band from 1.640.8  ev , and photon indices in the range @xmath48 in the x - ray band from 0.250  kev . the continuum in the xuv band",
    "is also assumed to be a powerlaw connecting the fluxes at 40.8  ev and 0.2  kev , such that the ratio of the fluxes at 250  nm and 2  kev is always @xmath49 ( corresponding to an optical  to  x - ray _ energy _",
    "index @xmath50  but see below ) . following netzer ( 1996 ) , we assume undepleted cosmic abundances ( with ( he , c ,",
    "n , o , ne , mg , si , s , fe)/h = ( @xmath51 , 3.7 , 1.1 , 8 , 1.1 , 0.37 , 0.35 , 0.16 , 0.4)/@xmath52 ) and a constant density of @xmath53 throughout the slab .",
    "however it should be noted that as discussed in netzer ( 1996 ) , for the same illuminating continuum , a wide range of densities ( @xmath54 ) give rise to similar equilibrium solutions ( and hence similarly shaped absorption / emission models ) .",
    "thus under steady - state conditions our models are insensitive to the precise value of @xmath55 assumed .",
    "the ionization state of the gas is parameterized by the ionization parameter , @xmath56 , defined as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the rate of photon emission at energy @xmath59 , @xmath60 the distance from the source to the illuminated gas . in the past",
    ", ionization parameters ( defined in various ways ) involving an integration of the entire uv  x - ray continuum above 13.6  ev ( with an upper limit often set to 13.6  kev ) have been commonly used in the literature . as pointed out in netzer ( 1996 ) ,",
    "the use of @xmath56 is preferable in the study of the effects of ionized gas in the x - ray regime as the level of ionization of the dominant species is then directly proportional to @xmath56 .",
    "of course the use of @xmath56 has the additional advantage that it is independent of the form of the continuum assumed in the 13.6100  ev band which is unobservable due to absorption in our own galaxy for low redshift objects . for convenience ,",
    "the relationships between @xmath56 and such ionization parameters are shown for a number of spectral forms in fig .",
    "it should be stressed whilst the conversions between @xmath56 and these more traditional ionization parameters are obviously a strong function of the assumed continuum @xmath61  kev , the values derived for @xmath56 here are almost completely insensitive to such assumptions .",
    "a series of such models were run for various @xmath56 and thicknesses through an illuminated slab , the latter parameterized by the column density of the gas , @xmath62 .",
    "two grids were produced for a number of values of @xmath63 in the above range , and converted to a form able to be used within xspec .",
    "the first grid consisted of only the absorption ( with values between zero and unity ) of the incident continuum taking place within the illuminated slab .",
    "the assumed ionizing continuum was multiplied by this grid during the spectral analysis , and is referred to as the ionized - absorber below .",
    "the axes of this grid are spaced logarithmically over the ranges @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "such a model would be applicable if the gas only covers the small fraction of the solid angle surrounding the central source along the line - of - sight ( the small clouds case of netzer 1993 ) .    the second grid of spectra consisted of the continua compton - scattered by the slab ( but including the effects of absorption during its passage through the slab ) , along with the emission lines and recombination continua produced within the gas .",
    "the normalizations , @xmath66 , of the spectra in this grid are calculated by integrating the total emission emerging from the shell . since",
    "to first order this emission is isotropic for the values of @xmath62 and @xmath56 considered here , @xmath66 can be compared to @xmath67 to give an estimate of the fraction of the hemisphere required to be present in order to produce the observed emission , and hence the solid angle subtended by the emitting gas at the ionizing source @xmath68 ( assuming spherical symmetry ) .",
    "thus combining these spectra from the ionized - emitter with the effects of the ionized - absorber on the underlying continuum enables us to investigate a range of physically plausible conditions within , and location and geometry of , the photoionized gas .",
    "[ sec : models ]    the models considered in the spectral analysis include an underlying continuum which we assume to be a powerlaw of photon index @xmath63 and normalization @xmath67 at 1  kev . in all cases the spectrum emerging from the source passes through a full screen of neutral material at zero redshift .",
    "this screen is parameterized by an effective column density @xmath69 of hydrogen , which is constrained to be @xmath70 , the galactic hi column density along that line - of - sight ( table  1 ) .",
    "we have performed the analysis assuming a variety of spectral models of varying levels of complexity . for the purposes of clarity",
    ", we present the results in the following order :    the power - law continuum is absorbed by an additional screen of neutral material along the line - of - sight at the redshift of the source ( parameterized by an effective column density @xmath62 of hydrogen ) .",
    "this model therefore has 3 interesting parameters : @xmath63 , @xmath62 and @xmath69 .    as for model _ a _ , but where the absorbing material at the redshift of the source is ionized and parameterized by @xmath62 and ionization parameter @xmath56 ( see  [ sec : ion_model ] ) .",
    "this model has 4 interesting parameters : @xmath63 , @xmath62 , @xmath56 and @xmath69 .    as for model _",
    "b _ , but the emission features expected from the ionized gas ( with @xmath62 and @xmath56 ) are included , parameterized by @xmath68 , the solid angle subtended by the emitting gas as seen at the central continuum source ( see  [ sec : ion_model ] ) .",
    "this model has 5 interesting parameters : @xmath63 , @xmath62 , @xmath56 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .    for each model , the spectral analysis",
    "is performed under two assumptions :    ( )    that the absorbing material at the redshift of the source completely covers the source , and that no continuum photons are able to reach the observer via any other light paths .",
    "these models are labelled _",
    "a(i ) _ , _ b(i ) _ and _ c(i ) _ throughout .    that a fraction @xmath71 of the power - law continuum is observed without attenuation at the redshift of the source , whilst @xmath72 of the continuum is attenuated by material along the line - of - sight at the redshift of the source .",
    "of course this is mathematically equivalent to either an absorber within the cylinder - of - sight which does not completely cover the central source and/or to a geometry where the central source is completely covered by the absorber but in which some fraction of the radiation emitted by the central source in other directions is scattered back into the line - of - sight without any spectral change .",
    "these models are labelled _",
    "a(ii ) _ , _ b(ii ) _ and _ c(ii ) _ throughout , and have @xmath71 as an additional interesting parameter .",
    "we have applied all the models to all the datasets , and tabulate all the results even though the additional parameters in the more complex models may not be required by some datasets .",
    "this enables us to present the limits on all the parameters with a view to unification schemes .",
    "the results assuming models _",
    "a(i)__c(ii ) _ are presented in ",
    "[ sec : basic_models ] .",
    "a number of additional models are discussed in  [ sec : additional_models ] , and notes on individual sources are given in the appendix .",
    "the ultimate goal is to classify objects according to the categories defined above and try to establish the fraction of spectra that require the ionized gas component .",
    "we use a number of criteria to establish whether we consider a model to be consistent with a given dataset . during the spectral analysis we use the @xmath39-statistic to determine the best - fitting model parameters .",
    "thus this statistic is used in conjunction with the number of degrees - of - freedom ( @xmath73 ) to determine the goodness - of - fit over the energy range used during the analysis ( _ ie _ 0.65 , 710  kev ) . to this end",
    ", we use the probability , @xmath74 , that the statistic should be less than the observed value of @xmath39 under the assumption that the model is indeed the true representation of the data .",
    "thus @xmath75 corresponds to a reduced@xmath39 value of unity , values of @xmath76 indicate that the data are poorly represented by the model , and values of @xmath77 indicate that the model is most likely an over - parameterization of the data . for the purposes of this paper ,",
    "we consider the model to be an adequate description of the data ( in the 0.65 , 710  kev band ) if @xmath78 ( but flag occasions when @xmath79 ) .",
    "in addition , however , we also require that the best - fitting model extrapolates into the bands excluded from the fit ( i.e. @xmath45  kev and in the 57  kev band ) . in the light of the uncertainties in the calibration of the instrument at energies",

    "1997a ) and lack of evidence to the contrary here , we conclude our assumption to be valid .      during the analysis presented in  [ sec : basic_models ] , a number of datasets were observed to consistently exhibit a deficit in their data / model ratio at @xmath81  kev .",
    "this feature was most evident in both datasets of ngc  3783 ( e.g. figs  6 , 9 &  10 ) and mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ( figs  9 &  10 ) , and in the single dataset from ngc  3516 ( fig  6 ) .",
    "as noted in the introduction , the @xmath81  kev deficit has also been seen by a number of other workers , and since it appears close to the @xmath6-shell edges of o and ne , it has been suggested that it is the result of absorption by a second cloud / screen of ionized gas along the line - of - sight ( e.g. kriss et al . 1996a",

    "the addition of this component improved the goodness - of - fit at @xmath90% confidence for all 5 datasets .",

    "c(i ) _ and obtained similar results , except that the edge in ngc  3783(1 ) is now also consistent with that due to oviii .",

    "for example , in the case of the high signal - to - noise , powerlaw dataset 3c  120 , we find the additional of an oviii edge to model _",
    "b(i ) _ makes an insignificant improvement in the goodness - of - fit ( @xmath151 ) , with @xmath152 at 90% confidence ( for one interesting parameter ) .",
    "we consider these results to be indicative of a second absorbing system in some objects .",
    "this possibility , along with the fact that the 1  kev deficit is present in the datasets with the strongest absorption features , is discussed in ",
    "[ sec : disc-2ion ] .",
    "in paper  ii we presented an analysis of the spectra of all 23 datasets in the 310  kev band .",
    "the approach used was to approximate the underlying continuum with a powerlaw in order to perform a detailed investigation the profile of the fe @xmath12 line . in the present work ,",
    "we have ignored the 57  kev band , which contains the bulk of the fe @xmath12 line emission .",
    "clearly it is inappropriate to repeat here the full analysis presented in paper  ii .",
    "however there are two consistency checks which should be performed .",
    "first , in  [ sec : basic_models ] we have shown that the 0.610  kev continuum in these sources can be well represented by a powerlaw imprinted with ( primarily absorption ) features due to ionized gas along the line - of - sight .",
    "comparison of tables  36 with the corresponding results from paper  ii reveal consistent values of @xmath63 .",
    "thus the approximation of the local continuum used in paper  ii is indeed valid , and hence the intensity and profile of the line emission presented in paper  ii is also valid .",
    "this is illustrated in fig  14 in which we show the mean profiles obtained for models _",
    "b(ii ) _ , _",
    "c(i ) _ and _ c(ii ) _ compared to that presented in paper  ii .",
    "second , models _",
    "c(i ) _ and _ c(ii ) _ contain the emission spectrum for the ionized gas , which includes significant fe @xmath6-shell features in certain regions of @xmath62@xmath56 parameter - space .",
    "we have therefore repeated the analysis for these models , but including the 57  kev band and an emission line as an additional spectral component .",
    "the profile of the emission line assumed is that expected from the innermost regions of an accretion disk under the influence of the strong gravitation effects of the central black hole . for convenience ,",
    "we have followed paper  ii and adopted the parameterization of fabian et al ( 1989 ) , fixing the inner and outer radii of the disk at @xmath153 and @xmath154 ( respectively , where @xmath155 is the gravitational radius ) , the axis of rotation with respect to the line - of - sight of @xmath156 , and the ( rest - frame ) energy of the line to be @xmath157  kev .",
    "the emissivity of the line is parameterized as a powerlaw as a function of radius ( @xmath158 ) , leaving only the equivalent width of the line , @xmath159 , as a free parameter .",
    "as may be expected from fig  14 , for both models _",
    "c(i ) _ and _ c(ii ) _ , we find results consistent with those presented in paper  ii , with mean equivalent widths of the diskline @xmath160  ev , compared with @xmath161  ev derived from table  5 of paper  ii .      _ ginga _ observations indicated a large fraction ( @xmath162% ) of type-1 agn might possess a significant fe absorption edge in the 7.18.9  kev band ( nandra & pounds 1994 ) .",
    "however given the spectral resolution of the lac and the presence of the strong fe @xmath6-shell emission in the 67  kev band , the parameters of such a feature could not be unambiguously determined by _",
    "ginga_. nevertheless , nandra & pounds did find a preferred energy of @xmath163  kev ( equivalent to fexviii ) and effective hydrogen column densities @xmath164few@xmath165 .",
    "unfortunately the end of the effective bandpass of the sis and gis at @xmath166  kev and the low signal - to - noise ratio of most datasets in the 710  kev band makes the study of such a feature extremely difficult with _",
    "asca_. we have not attempted such a study here , especially since we employed an analysis technique whereby we explicitly excluded the fe @xmath6-shell emission ( in the 57  kev band ) from the majority of the fits .",
    "however as can be seen in figs  6 , 9 , 10 & 12 , our models for the photoionized gas do _ not _ predict significant fe @xmath6-shell absorption edges for the values of @xmath56 and @xmath62 typically derived in ",
    "[ sec : basic_models ] ( the _ asca _ results being primarily based on o @xmath6-shell , ne @xmath6-shell and fe @xmath167-shell absorption features ) . if confirmed , the absorption features seen by _ ginga _ imply an additional , large column density of highly - ionized gas along the cylinder - of - sight , possibly related to that suggested as responsible for the @xmath5  kev deficit described in ",
    "[ sec:2ion ] .",
    "however we note that there is no obvious evidence for such features in fig  14 .      given the diversity in the observed spectra presented here , the assumption that the continuum is well represented by a single powerlaw over the entire 0.410  kev band can be questioned .",
    "indeed , based on both observational and theoretical arguments , in the past a number of more complex spectral forms have been suggested for the underlying x - ray continuum in seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "these can be divided into those in which the underlying emission mechanism gives rise to a continuum with a more complex form ( a simple case case a continuum represented by the sum of two powerlaws ) , and those in which a primary powerlaw continuum is augmented by other sources of emission ( both thermal and non - thermal , inside and outside the active nucleus ) .    in  [ sec : basic_models ] we found a number of datasets consistently satisfied by best - fitting parameters which could imply a gradual flattening of the observed spectrum to higher energies ( e.g. mrk  335 , ngc  4051 , ic  4329a ) .",
    "the data / model residuals of a number of other datasets also imply a soft excess of counts at the lowest energies and/or a hard tail at the highest energies ( e.g. ngc  3516 , 3c  120 ) . in the light of this , we have investigated two forms of the continuum commonly assumed for seyfert 1 galaxies : the addition of a compton reflection component , and an underlying continuum represented by the sum of two powerlaws .",
    "we have also investigated the inclusion of a thermal emission component at the softest energies .",
    "it should be remembered , however , that spectral curvature can of course also arise as the result of spectral variability within an observation . throughout this paper",
    "we consider only the mean spectra .",
    "however in paper  i we presented evidence for variability in many of the datasets . in most datasets any _ spectral _ variability was of relatively low amplitude , but a number of cases ( primarily the low luminosity sources , and especially ngc  4051 ) , the amplitude could be at a level to start affecting our analysis of the mean spectra .",
    "compton - reflection of the primary continuum by optically - thick , neutral material out of the line - of - sight is often invoked as an explanation of the high equivalent width of the fe @xmath12 line emission and flattening of the spectrum @xmath168  kev in many agn ( e.g. nandra & pounds 1994 ) .",
    "the presence of an unresolved reflection component can flatten the observed continuum , so the underlying continuum could be slightly steeper than observed , which could have implications on the best - fitting values of the parameters associated with the ionized gas .",
    "we have therefore repeated the analysis for model _",
    "c(ii ) _ including the effects of the compton - reflection , which we parameterize by the addition of the enhancement factor , @xmath169 , of the reflected continuum ( only ) compared to that expected from a semi - infinite plane illuminated by a point source viewed face - on .",
    "we find fixing @xmath170 does not improve the goodness  of  fit at @xmath171% confidence for any of the datasets .",
    "as expected , in most cases the derived spectral index is slightly steepened by @xmath172 , and in all cases best - fitting values of @xmath62 and @xmath56 are consistent with those quoted in table  8 .",
    "interestingly , allowing @xmath169 to be a free parameter in the analysis , we do find a significant improvement in the goodness  of  fit for 9 datasets ( mrk  335 , ngc  3783(2 ) , ngc  4051 , ngc  4593 , mcg-6 - 30 - 15(1,2 ) , ic  4329a , ngc  5548 , mrk  509 ) , with @xmath17335 .",
    "such values have been suggested for some of these objects by previous studies using different instrumentation ( e.g. nandra & pounds 1994 ; molendi et al , 1997 ) .",
    "however , since the _ asca _ bandpass effectively ends at 10  kev , such a component is difficult to constrain and weaker compton - reflection components would be undetectable . for @xmath174 ,",
    "the predicted equivalent width of the fe @xmath12 from the reflecting material can be approximated by @xmath175  ev , where @xmath176 is the abundance of fe relative to hydrogen ( e.g. george & fabian 1991 ) .",
    "the most recent estimations of the fe abundance are @xmath177 ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) and @xmath178 ( feldman 1992 ) , and from observations we find @xmath160  ev (  [ sec : fe - line ] ) for these 9 datasets .",
    "thus these best - fitting solutions imply a moderate under - abundance of fe in these seyferts compared to solar values .",
    "we do not consider this unreasonable _ per se _ , but note these solutions may also be indicative of curvature in the underlying continuum shape , rather than the presence of a strong reflection component . indeed alternative explanations are available in the case of mrk  335 , ngc  4051 , ic  4329a ( see  [ sec:2plaw ] ) . in any event",
    ", we find the inclusion of the reflection component typically only steepens the underlying spectral index by @xmath179 in these 9 datasets , and in all cases again find the best - fitting values of @xmath62 and @xmath56 are within the error ranges quoted in table  8 .",
    "the form of the continuum considered in this section is represented by the sum of two powerlaws , with photon indices @xmath180 and @xmath181 ( where @xmath182 ) . the ratio of the normalization of the soft powerlaw divided by that of the hard powerlaw at 1  kev ( in the rest - frame of the source ) is denoted by @xmath183 . for computational expediency we restrict parameter space such that @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",

    "we concentrate on the results when this additional powerlaw component is added to model _",

    "we find this model leads to an improvement over the results obtained assuming model _",
    "c(ii ) _ for 10 of the 23 datasets at @xmath10399% confidence .",
    "the best - fitting solutions for 4 of these datasets have @xmath186 with both powerlaws of similar importance over a sizable fraction of the _ asca _ bandpass . in the case of the remaining 6 datasets , the bulk of the _ asca _ bandpass is dominated by a single powerlaw , with the second powerlaw component making a significant contribution only at either the very lowest energies ( the ultra - soft excess datasets ) or highest energies ( the hard tail datasets ) .",
    "we consider first the 3 datasets ( 3c  120 , ngc  4593 , mrk  509 ) for which this model implies a hard tail. naturally we find the powerlaw which dominates the observed spectrum at the highest energies to be relatively weak ( @xmath187 ) and flat ( although its photon index is poorly constrained within the range @xmath188 ) . in each case",
    "the steeper powerlaw , dominating the observed spectrum over most of the _ asca _ bandpass , has a photon index steeper by @xmath189 than that found assuming model _",
    "c(ii ) _ ( in fact all 3 datasets have @xmath190 ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that the underlying continua derived for these 3 datasets assuming this model exhibit only a relatively subtle curvature across the _ asca _ bandpass .",
    "it is therefore not that surprising that in all cases the best - fitting values of the parameters associated with the ionized gas ( @xmath56 and @xmath62 ) are similar to those found when the underlying continuum is approximated by a single powerlaw .",
    "turning now to the 3 datasets for which this model implies an ultra - soft excess ( ngc  3516 , mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ( 1,2 ) ) , in all cases we find the powerlaw which dominates the observed spectrum over most of the _ asca _ bandpass has a photon index flatter by @xmath191 than that found for model _ c(ii)_. the best - fitting solutions imply a very steep second powerlaw component ( pegging at our upper limit of @xmath192 for all 3 datasets ) dominating the observed spectrum only at the very lowest energies ( with @xmath1930.5 ) .",
    "however , none of the best - fitting models extrapolate @xmath930.6  kev in a satisfactory manner ( even given best - fitting values of @xmath69 significantly in excess of @xmath24 ) , and all imply an @xmath31 far steeper than that observed .",
    "further investigation of such a component is extremely difficult with _ asca _ data .",
    "however , again , the best - fitting values of the parameters associated with the ionized gas ( @xmath56 and @xmath62 ) are similar to those found when the underlying continuum is approximated by a single powerlaw .    finally , we consider the remaining 4 datasets for which this analysis indicates both powerlaws are of similar importance over a sizeable fraction of the _ asca _ bandpass ( mrk  335 , ngc  4051 , ic  4329a , ngc  5548 ) . the best - fitting parameters of for these datasets are listed in table  11 , and the derived model spectra and data / model ratios shown in fig  15 . as further discussed in the appendix , the form of the continuum implied for mrk  335 is in good agreement with previous observations .",
    "however any imprints due to ionized gas are weak in mrk  335 , allowing no useful constraints to be placed on @xmath62 , @xmath56 or @xmath68 .",
    "the best - fitting solution for the other 3 datasets are somewhat similar , with a relatively steep ( @xmath194 ) powerlaw dominating the spectrum @xmath18  kev along with evidence for absorption and emission from ionized gas . however , in all 3 cases the reality of such a continuum can be questioned .",
    "significant spectral and flux variability occur on timescales much shorter than the observation period in the case of ngc  4051 ( paper  i ) .",
    "thus we consider short - timescale spectral variability may be partly responsible for the apparent curvature of the underlying continuum in ngc  4051 .",
    "as is apparent from table  11 , this model fails to satisfy our criteria for acceptability in the case of ic  4329a .",
    "as further discussed in the appendix , this source appears to have a particularly complex spectral form , and hence it is difficult to judge the robustness of the values derived for @xmath62 , @xmath56 or @xmath68 . in the case of ngc  5548",
    ", an acceptable fit is achieved assuming this model .",
    "however it should be noted that the steep ( @xmath195 ) , soft component derived does appear to be a relatively poor representation of the data @xmath196  kev , implying a neutral column density far in excess of @xmath70 ( @xmath197 ) and giving @xmath198 ( though @xmath199 ) . finally , as shown in ",
    "[ sec : reflection ] , a single powerlaw with a strong compton - reflection component can provide a comparable fit for all 3 datasets .",
    "it has long been suggested that seyfert galaxies are likely to contain several sites which give rise to thermal emission at temperatures consistent with soft x - rays .",
    "these sites occur on different size - scales and arise as a result of processes both directly related to and independent of the agn phenomenon .",
    "examples include regions of active star formation , the hot - phase of the narrow emission - line region ( nelr ) , the halo of the galaxy and the shock- or x - ray heated ambient interstellar medium ( ism ) . thermal emission closely associated with the active nucleus is also expected as a result of the accretion process itself and as a result of the absorption ( followed by thermalization ) of the continuum .",
    "the relative importance of such components probably differs from object to object . in the case of ngc  4151 , _",
    "hri and _ rosat _ hri observations have revealed spatially resolved soft x - ray emission ( elvis , briel & henry 1983 ; morse et al 1995 ) . _",
    "asca _ observations of normal galaxies have also revealed soft x - ray emission with temperatures in the range @xmath2000.6  kev , and luminosities @xmath201@xmath202 ( e.g. makishima 1994 ; serlemitsos , ptak & yaqoob 1996 ) .",
    "thus one could question whether the existence of such a component might effect our conclusions regarding the photoionized gas  particularly since the thermal emission offers an alternative to the decreased opacity and emission features at the lowest energies implied in previous models .",
    "we have investigated this by including a component due to an optically - thin plasma ( with cosmic abundances , parameterized by a temperature @xmath203 and unabsorbed luminosity @xmath204 in the 0.13.0  kev band ) to model _",
    "c(ii ) _ ( but located _ outside _ the photoionized absorber ) .",
    "we find that the goodness - of - fit is indeed improved ( @xmath205 ) in the case of all 3 datasets of ngc  4151 , with @xmath206  kev and @xmath207 , consistent with the luminosity of the extended gas measured by the _",
    "rosat _ hri observation ( see  [ sec : multi-4151 ] and appendix ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that in the _ asca _ bandpass , the dominant features from such gas are fe @xmath167-shell lines in the 0.71.5  kev regime .",
    "thus whilst @xmath204 is a function of @xmath176 , the addition of this optically - thin component does not significantly affect the derived values for all other of the parameters ( although the size of the allowed parameter space is obviously increased ",
    "e.g. see fig  16 ) .",
    "we find no other dataset is significantly improved by the inclusion of emission from thermal gas at such a temperature .",
    "this is hardly surprising since only ngc  4151 occupied a region of the @xmath62@xmath56 plane in which emission of similar strength would not be swamped by the underlying continuum .",
    "thus we consider the the omission of such a component is generally not important in our results .      in summary",
    ", we find evidence for significant curvature in the _ observed _ continuum in approximately half of the datasets considered . we have shown that for the majority of the datasets , such curvature can be accounted for by the inclusion of a compton - reflection and/or a second powerlaw component .",
    "however , in the majority of cases , the ionizing continuum can be well represented by a single powerlaw ( with @xmath0 ) close to the ovii and oviii absorption edges .",
    "these edges provide the main diagnostics for our photoionization models .",
    "thus we consider that the best - fitting parameters associated with the ionized gas derived in models _ b _ and _ c _ are generally reliable . allowing the presence of a low - temperature , thermal component improved the fit only in the case of ngc  4151 .",
    "however , again we found it to have no significant effect on the best - fitting parameters associated with the ionized gas .",
    "our sample contains more than one observation of ngc  3783 , ngc  4151 , mcg-6 - 30 - 15 and mrk  841 .",
    "we have found evidence for absorption by ionized material in all four sources , enabling us to compare and contrast the behaviour of the ionized gas .",

    "the former offers the simplest interpretation of these data : a screen of ionized gas completely covers the cylinder - of - sight in ngc  3783 , becoming more highly ionized as the photoionizing flux increases .",
    "both observations are consistent with the presence of emission from the ionized material , with @xmath216@xmath217 in the 0.110  kev band ( after correcting for absorption ) . unfortunately however , the signal - to - noise ratio of these datasets is too low to unambiguously determine whether the intensity of this emission responded to the increase in the ionizing continuum .",
    "interestingly , a @xmath218  kev deficit was also evident for both datasets in the data / model residuals of all the models considered in ",
    "[ sec : basic_models ] .",
    "this can be modeled by an additional absorption edge ( @xmath219 ) at an energy close to that of oviii (  [ sec:2ion ] ) and most likely due to an additional screen of more - highly ionized gas covering part , or all , the cylinder - of - sight .",
    "[ sec : bolx ]    three datasets of ngc  4151 fulfilled the criteria defining this sample ( paper  i ) .",
    "these were an observation performed 1993 nov 05 ( ngc  4151(2 ) ) , an observation performed exactly 30 days later ( ngc  4151(4 ) ) , and an observation performed 2 days thereafter ( ngc  4151(5 ) ) .",
    "the observed count rate for ngc  4151(4 ) was only @xmath220% higher than that for ngc  4151(2 ) , but that for ngc  4151(5 ) was @xmath221% higher .",
    "as shown in table  12 , we find a fit satisfying our criteria for acceptability is achieved for the first two observations ( ngc  4151(2,4 ) ) only when the absorbing material is allowed to be ionized _ and _ a fraction of the underlying continuum is allowed to escape without suffering any attenuation ( i.e. models _",

    "such an hypothesis is strongly supported by the third observation ( ngc  4151(5 ) ) , even though none of the models in  [ sec : basic_models ] provide a solution which formally satisfies our criteria for acceptability ( see fig .",
    "9 ) .    as can been seen from tables  6 and  8 ,",
    "all 3 datasets are consistent with @xmath2224% and @xmath10 .",
    "however the parameters associated with the ionized gas vary in an interesting manner ( see also fig  16 ) . in the month between the ngc  4151(2 ) and ngc  4151(4 ) observations , there is an increase in the absorbing column density ( @xmath223 ) and increase in ionization parameter ( @xmath224% ) , whilst the derived luminosity of the ionizing continuum ( in the 0.110  kev for model _",
    "c(ii ) _ , after correcting for absorption ) increases by @xmath225% ( from @xmath226 to @xmath227 ) .",
    "two days later , at the time of the ngc  4151(5 ) observation , @xmath62 is similar to ngc  4151(4 ) .",

    "a simple explanation of such behaviour is that the absorbing gas completely covers the cylinder  of  sight but is inhomogeneous ( with differing @xmath62 and/or @xmath55 ) on a scale comparable or greater in size to that of the central source , whilst a constant fraction @xmath71 of the underlying continuum follows an alternate path",
    ". if the transverse velocity of the absorbing material is sufficiently high , then the movement of such clumps across the cylinder  of  sight would then give rise to variations in @xmath56 , @xmath62 seemingly decoupled from variations in the intensity of the underlying source . assuming only keplerian motion , the length - scale @xmath230 passing through a given line  of  sight in a time @xmath231 is @xmath232 at a distance @xmath233  light - days from a central object with a bolometric luminosity @xmath234 emitting at a fraction @xmath235 of its eddington luminosity , where @xmath231 is in seconds",

    "considering the variability between the 4151(2 ) and 4151(4 ) datasets and thus setting @xmath243  days , we obtain the limit @xmath244  light - days assuming @xmath245  s. the limit if the same explanation is proposed to explain the variations between the 4151(4 ) and 4151(5 ) datasets ( @xmath246  days ) is a factor @xmath247 smaller .",
    "we stress that these limits are based only upon the keplerian motion , which may not be the major component governing the dynamics of the photoionized clouds .",
    "in  [ sec : thermal ] we found that there was evidence for an additional spectral component , which we tentatively identified with the extended soft x - ray emission seen in this source and modeled as an optically - thin plasma .",
    "we found that all 3 datasets are consistent with such gas with @xmath248  kev and @xmath249 .",
    "such a component alone ( but absorbed by @xmath24 ) would give rise to a count rate in the range @xmath250@xmath251 for the _ rosat _ hri , and hence is consistent with that reported for the extended emission in this source ( @xmath252 , morse et al 1995 ) .",

    "such behaviour has been reported previously for these datasets by fabian et al ( 1994 ) , and as in the case ngc  4151 , is difficult to reconcile with that expected in the simplest picture whereby a uniform shell of gas reacts to changes in the intensity of the photoionizing continuum . again appealing to only keplerian motion to move inhomogeneities through the cylinder  of  sight between the 2 observations ( i.e. setting @xmath260  weeks ) , and again setting the variability @xmath245  s , from eqn  [ eqn : r_ld ] one obtains the rather weak constraint @xmath261  light - days .",
    "again we note that these limits are based upon only the keplerian motion , which may not be the major component of the dynamics of the ionized gas .    however , there is evidence in a subsequent _ asca _ observation that whilst the depth of the ovii edge appears to be constant on long timescales in this source , the depth of the oviii edge varies on a timescale @xmath262  s ( otani et al 1996 ) .",

    ", few further comments can be made .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , it is becoming increasingly clear that the spectra of a number of individual agn contain features indicative of absorption by ionized gas within the cylinder - of - sight .",
    "it seems highly likely that this gas is photoionized by the intense radiation field produced by the central object .",
    "the aim of the work presented here was to determine the frequency and characteristics of such gas based upon new , self - consistent modelling using the ion photoionization code .    in the preceeding sections we have presented the results from 23 _ asca _ observations of 18 objects .",
    "when considered together these objects certainly do not constitute a complete sample . nevertheless , in at least some aspects , we do believe our results to be representative of the variety of properties exhibited by the type-1 agn as a whole .    in  [ sec :",
    "basic_models ] we considered models assuming",
    "the underlying continuum in the 0.610  kev band of our sources is well - represented by a single powerlaw .",
    "a number of models were considered , starting with the case in which the spectrum emerging from the source passes through two screens of neutral material fully covering the source : one at the redshift of the source and a second at zero redshift ( with column densities @xmath62 and @xmath69 respectively ) .",
    "models of increasing complexity were then considered by allowing a fraction ( @xmath71 ) of the underlying continuum to be observed _ without _ attenuation by @xmath62 , allowing the gas represented by @xmath62 to be photoionized ( with an ionization parameter @xmath56 ) , and finally by also including the emission spectrum expected from the ionized gas ( assuming it subtends a solid angle @xmath68 at the central source ) .    in  [ sec : additional_models ] the results of further spectral analysis were presented , including models with additional spectral components , with the primary goal of testing the robustness of the derived characteristics of the ionized gas .      all models considered in this work are single - zone models , and given the assumed gas density @xmath53 , the gas reacts instantaneously to continuum variations .",
    "however , the models are intended to represent a wide range of conditions including cases with much lower values of @xmath55 . in such cases ,",
    "the level of ionization represents the response of the gas to the long - term , average flux of the illuminating source .",
    "we have not considered all such cases here since we do not consider the data yet warrant this level of discussion .    in  [ sec : basic_models ] we found that one or more of the models considered offer an explanation of 17/23 datasets within the formal criteria outlined in  [ sec : acceptability ] .",
    "the criteria used to determine the acceptability of model as a description of the data is of course a somewhat subjective decision .",
    "the primary criterion used here that @xmath78 ( i.e. that the model is a true representation of the data with a probability of better than only 1 chance in 20 ) might be considered relatively lax by some readers .",
    "furthermore , as can been seen from tables  38 , a perfect parameterisation of the data ( @xmath270 corresponding to a reduced@xmath39 value of unity ) is only obtained in a small number of cases .",
    "relatively high values of @xmath74 imply that there are residuals in the data not modelled adequately .",
    "however , whilst some of these residuals might be carrying physical information associated with the source , others might be the result of inaccuracies in the calibration of the instruments ( see also fig .  13 ) .",
    "the latter is currently under intense study by the instrument teams in anticipation of being able to assign unmodelled residuals to the former explanation with a higher degree of confidence .",
    "however our intention in this paper is to explore just how well the data from the sample can be described by our relatively simple models for the ionized gas .",
    "we believe this approach compliments that taken by some previous workers where the absorption features introduced by the ionized material are modelled as a series of absorption edges . throughout the analysis",
    "we have not assumed any systematic errors , and have implicitly assigned the relatively poor values of @xmath74 to be the result of problems with the calibration in the case of 4 additional datasets in  [ sec : basic_models ] ( table  12 ) .",
    "furthermore , beyond the limited number considered in  [ sec : additional_models ] , we have not explored more complex models in detail .",
    "for instance we have not considered models in which the ionized material has a significant ( @xmath271 ) velocity dispersion along the line - of - sight .",
    "given the spectral resolution of the sis detectors , dispersions smaller than this value are impossible to constrain with the signal - to - noise ratio of the data presented here ( see also  [ sec : redshift ] ) .",
    "we have not explored different abundance ratios , or multi - component models in those cases where we have indications for their existence ( see  [ sec : disc-2ion ] ) .",
    "our intention in the present work is merely point the reader to the need of such analysis and defer it for future discussion .",
    "it is well established that many seyfert  1 galaxies exhibit so - called soft - excesses and compton - reflection tails ( e.g. turner & pounds 1989 ; nandra & pounds 1994 ) .",
    "after accounting for these effects , and those of the ionized - absorber , _ ginga _ observations showed that the underlying x - ray continua can be generally well represented by a powerlaw of photon index @xmath72.0 ( e.g. nandra & pounds 1994 ) . in  [",

    "it should be noted that in a number of cases the best - fitting models imply that very little of the underlying continuum is observed directly ( e.g. see ngc  3783(1,2 ) in fig  6 ; ngc  4151(2,4,5 ) in fig  9 ) . in passing we",

    "however in at least ngc  5548 we consider the evidence for curvature in the _ underlying _ continuum to be questionable and/or alternative explanations are available ( see  [ sec:2plaw ] ) .",
    "the observed spectrum of ngc  4151 has long been considered somewhat idiosyncratic amongst seyfert 1 galaxies .",

    "a detailed source - by - source comparison between our results and those of reynolds ( 1997 ) and other workers is provided in the appendix .",
    "we find no preferred value of @xmath62 under any of the models tested , with clear differences from object  to  object ( e.g. fig .  3 ) .",

    "data , the presence of ionized gas is most readily inferred by deep ( @xmath288 ) absorption edges which it introduces into the observed x - ray spectrum . for a given value of @xmath62",
    ", there is a maximum value of @xmath56 above which the gas is unstable and goes to the high electron temperature ( @xmath289  k ) branch of the two - phase curve ( e.g. see fig .  2 in netzer 1996 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath56 at which this thermal instability occurs is a function of the gas density and composition , along with the form of the ionizing continuum . under the assumptions made here ,",
    "the instability occurs for @xmath290 .",
    "such gas is completely transparent , and the observed spectrum will be identical to the underlying ( powerlaw ) continuum , consistent with the data from a minority of objects in our sample .",
    "therefore the presence of such material along the cylinder  of  sight is impossible to prove ( or disprove ) using the current _ asca _ data alone , offering a potential explanation of the apparent lack of objects with @xmath287 in fig .",
    "7 .    for @xmath291 ,",
    "different ions contribute different continuum opacity , depending on the gas composition and level of ionization . for @xmath292 and @xmath293 ,",
    "most of the opacity is due to ovii and oviii ( fig  8) . for lower values of @xmath56 , carbon , nitrogen and lower ionization states of oxygen",
    "are more important .",
    "however , we note that none of the objects presented here lay in the region of @xmath56@xmath62 parameter - space where @xmath294 , @xmath295 .",
    "there is no reason _ a priori _ why there should not be objects with ionized material in this region .",
    "however , there is a potential selection - effect here whereby if such material lays along the cylinder  of  sight to the broad emission line region ( belr ) and contains embedded dust , the broad emission lines will be absorbed by this material .",
    "this may lead to such objects being classified as something other than seyfert 1 galaxies , and hence being excluded from the sample of sources presented here .",
    "alternatively , should this explanation not be the case , then there must be some yet unknown mechanism that determines these unique conditions by either fixing the pressure or perhaps the dynamical state of the absorbing material .",
    "future studies of a larger sample of objects are required to investigate these possibilities .",
    "we have compared the parameters of the ionized gas with the derived continuum luminosity , @xmath37 , in the 0.110  kev band ( after correcting for absorption ) .",
    "we find no clear relation between @xmath62 and @xmath37 , but some indication that @xmath296 ( fig .",
    "if true , from the definition of @xmath56 ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : u_x ] ) , this implies the ionized gas has similar densities , @xmath55 , and is at similar radii , @xmath60 in all sources .",
    "however , the majority of the sources considered here for which @xmath56 is well constrained lie within a restricted range of @xmath37 ( @xmath297@xmath298 ) . a recent observation of the quasar pg  1114 + 445 ( @xmath299 ) also exhibits strong absorption features due to ionized gas with @xmath300 and @xmath301 ( george et al .",
    "furthermore , nandra et al ( 1997e ) have recently reported the results from _ asca _ observations of the rqq mr  2251 - 178 ( @xmath302 , @xmath303 ) , finding @xmath304 and @xmath305 .",
    "inclusion of these objects on fig .",
    "17 argues against any obvious relation between @xmath56 and @xmath37 .",
    "we found no evidence for any relationship between any other pairs of parameters derived from the x - ray results ( e.g. @xmath37 vs @xmath63 ; @xmath63 vs @xmath56 ; @xmath63 vs @xmath62 ) . in most cases",
    "this is again primarily due to the limited range of @xmath37 and/or @xmath63 exhibited by most the objects in the sample .",
    "thus , further progress requires high signal - to - noise observations of similar sources covering the high and low @xmath37 regimes .",
    "the dominant effects of the ionized gas on the observed spectrum from these sources is absorption by the material along the line - of - sight .",
    "however , ionized material out of the line - of - sight will give rise to emission lines and recombination continua , along with the ( absorbed ) continuum compton - scattered back into the line - of - sight .",
    "the inclusion of such an emission component leads to an improvement at @xmath10399% confidence in 11 datasets ( 9 objects ) in the full covering case ( model _ c(i ) _ ) , and 8 datasets ( 7 objects ) in the partial covering case ( model _ c(ii ) _ ) .",
    "however there is no case for which this component is _ required _",
    "( i.e. a satisfactory fit only obtained for model _ c _ ) .",
    "it should also be noted that the inclusion of the emission component generally does not have a significant effect on the values derived for @xmath56 and @xmath62 . for the value of @xmath56 and",
    "@xmath62 derived for the majority of sources , the emitted spectrum contains significant line emission in the 0.62.0  kev band , but constitutes only a relatively small fraction ( @xmath225% ) of the total flux observed in this band , even when the ionized gas subtends a large solid angle at the central source .",
    "the best - fitting values of @xmath68 are ill - constrained , but in most cases consistent with @xmath306 , and there is no case where @xmath307 at @xmath308% confidence . formally we find @xmath309 @xmath310 for the datasets for which we obtained acceptable fits ,    in cases where the ionizing continuum source is constant , then the normalization of the emission spectrum is a direct measure of the geometry of the emitting gas .",
    "however in cases where the ionizing continuum varies , then the normalization of the emission spectrum will follow the luminosity history of the continuum source , with a lag due to light travel - time effects . in the latter case",
    "we are therefore offered the opportunity to determine the location of the ionized gas via the delay in the intensity of the emission features following variations in the ionizing continuum . unfortunately however , the signal - to - noise ratio is too low for the few objects presented here for which there are multiple observations (  [ sec : disc - multi ] ) to place even crude constraints on whether the intensity of the emission changed in an appropriate manner .      in  [ sec : basic_models ] &  [",
    "sec : additional_models ] , we find that allowing a fraction @xmath71 of the powerlaw continuum to be observed without suffering attenuation by the column density @xmath62 significantly improves the fit ( compared to the corresponding model with @xmath311 ) for a large number of dataset / model combinations . indeed ,",
    "inspection of @xmath102 ( table  4 ) reveals all but 3 datasets are improved in the case of model _",
    "a(ii ) _ , and inspection of @xmath127 and @xmath312 ( tables  6 and 8) reveals that 8 datasets are improved in the case of models _",

    "5 ) and as described in ",
    "[ sec : complex_cont ] are an artifact of spectral curvature .",
    "indeed , as shown in table  12 , only in the case of 2 datasets ( 1 object : ngc  4151 ) are solutions which satisfy our criteria for acceptability obtained * only * if @xmath128 .",
    "thus we conclude most of the sample show solutions close to the full - covering case and allowing @xmath71 as a free parameter does not significantly change the properties of the sample .",
    "as noted earlier , this model is appropriate to a partial covering of the cylinder  of  sight and to a geometry in which some fraction of the underlying continuum , initially emitted in other directions , is scattered back into the line - of - sight . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : disc - multi ] , a possible explanation for the spectral variability observed in ngc  4151 consists of clumps of photoionized gas ( of differing column density ) moving through the cylinder  of  sight on timescales @xmath18  day .",
    "under such an hypothesis , the fact that @xmath71 is similar for all the observations ( at @xmath85% ) suggests scattering as the most likely explanation .",
    "circumstantial support is provided by the observation of a similar component in many type-2 agn , with implications for unification schemes ( e.g. turner et al 1997a , b ) .",
    "indeed the optical spectrum of ngc  4151 has been observed to exhibit both type-1 and type-2 characteristics at various times .",
    "it should be noted that the parameterization used here approximates the scattered continuum as a simple powerlaw as would be appropriate in the case of pure electron scattering in a very highly - ionized medium . in a more realistic treatment , the ionization state of the scattering gas",
    "would be taken into account , which under a wide range of parameter space would lead to emission and absorption features further complicating the spectrum @xmath19  kev .",
    "it should be noted that the fact that such a component is unambiguously observed only in ngc  4151 amongst our sample is simply due to the suppression of the transmitted continuum by the high column density of gas within the cylinder  of  sight of this source ( with the gas having @xmath56 such that there s still significant opacity )      a number of sources have evidence for a deficit of counts at @xmath81  kev compared to the predictions of our photoionization models . as noted above ,",
    "such a deficit occurs in those sources exhibiting the strongest absorption features . in  [ sec:2ion ]",
    "we showed that this could be modeled with an additional edge ( consistent with oviii ) in the rest frame of the source .",
    "there are several possible explanations of such a feature .",
    "first , it could be indicative that the cylinder - of - sight contains at least two absorption systems , each of different density , @xmath55 , and column density , @xmath62 .",
    "such an hypothesis is supported in the case of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 by the short - timescale variability observed in the depth of the oviii edge whilst the depth of the ovii edge remains constant (  [ sec : disc - multi ] ) .",
    "circumstantial evidence for such a possibility also comes from the _ ginga _ observations that a large fraction of seyfert 1 galaxies ( including some of those considered here ) contain an fe @xmath6-shell absorption edge , far deeper than that predicted by the models considered here ( nandra & pounds 1994 ;  [ sec : fe - absorption ] ) .",
    "unfortunately the geometry of the absorption systems can not be constrained by the current data .",
    "one possible geometry is that both absorbing systems consist of complete screens , but at different radii from the central source .",
    "a full and correct treatment of such a scenario requires the ionization - equilibrium of the second screen of gas to be calculated in the same way as the first screen , but with the photoionizing continuum appropriate for that which has already passed through the first screen .",
    "such a treatment is beyond the scope of the current paper .",
    "an alternative geometry is that the absorbing screen is clumpy on scale - sizes smaller than the emission region , resulting in the observed spectrum being the sum of the spectra transmitted by regions of different density and @xmath62 .",
    "yet another possibility is that there is indeed only a single absorbing cloud along the line - of - sight at any instant , but that different clouds ( of different densities & @xmath62 ) move across the line - of - sight on timescales much shorter than the typical _ asca _ observation . in this case",
    "our analysis reveals time - averaged parameters of the absorber .",
    "finally , we note that some of our detailed assumptions regarding atomic processes may be inapplicable to agn , such as other processes important in determining the ionization equilibrium for ovii / oviii .",
    "given the uncertainty in the form of the primary continuum , the spectral resolution and typical signal - to - noise ratios typically achieved , it appears to be extremely difficult to distinguish between these possibilities using _ asca _ data .",
    "the location and geometry of this ionized gas is currently unclear , although there are prospects for future progress .",
    "of course if one knows the density , @xmath55 , of the ionized gas , @xmath56 and the intensity of the photoionizing source , one can use eqn .",
    "[ eqn : u_x ] to derive its radius as @xmath314 assuming @xmath53 ( as used for the model calculations ) , @xmath301 and @xmath3151 ( as appropriate for the majority of the objects presented here ) , one obtains @xmath316few light - days . such a location is comparable to that of the belr in these objects .",
    "however as noted in  [ sec : ion_model ] , our models are insensitive to densities in the range @xmath54 , thus values of @xmath317few light - years can not be excluded on this basis .    as described in  [ sec : disc - multi ] , the apparent variations in the column density of the ionized gas seen in the x - ray band can be used to place upper limits on the radius of the gas if one assumes these variations are due to inhomogeneities in the matter passing through the cylinder  of  sight due to _ only _ keplerian motion . for the few cases observed to - date ,",
    "such an assumption also implies a location close to the belr and hence is consistent with all / part of the same gas being responsible for the absorption features seen in the optical / uv . however such estimates are currently extremely crude , and it should be stressed that the bulk motion of the ionized gas is highly uncertain and could easily be dominated by other kinematics components .",
    "constraints on the location could be placed by applying ( under certain assumptions ) photoionization models to both the uv / optical and x - ray absorption features . as will be described in ",
    "[ sec : xuvabso - disc ] , the results from current studies are mixed and future progress requires simultaneous , high - resolution observations in all three wavebands .",
    "reverberation mapping using the emission features produced within the ionized gas is another means whereby the location of the material could be determined .",
    "however as described in  [ sec : disc - emis ] , current results are inconclusive .",
    "however we believe that in all likelihood there is ionized gas throughout the nuclear region in agn .",
    "multiple components , separated in at least velocity - space are seen explicitly in the optical / uv absorption features of some objects .",
    "at least two components are implied spectroscopically and/or from temporal variations in the x - ray absorption features of some objects .",
    "in addition , highly ionized gas ( occupying a different region of @xmath56 , @xmath62 parameter - space than that responsible for the absorption on seyfert 1 galaxies ) is commonly invoked to explain the scattered radiation in seyfert 2 galaxies ( e.g. see turner et al 1997b , c ) .",
    "should the volume of ionized gas contain embedded dust , and is located outside the appropriate emission regions , then one might expect a correlation between the column density @xmath62 derived from x - ray observations and the various reddening indicators at longer wavebands .",
    "such studies therefore have the potential for further constraining the location of absorbing material and/or geometry of the nuclear regions .",
    "brandt , fabian & pounds ( 1996 ) have recently suggested that the infrared - bright quasar iras  13349 + 2438 , which exhibits a large degree of reddening in the optical , might contain photoionized gas with internal dust .",
    "reynolds ( 1997 ) noted that mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , whose x - ray spectrum is clearly attenuated by ionized gas , also exhibits a large degree of reddening at longer wavelengths .",
    "the study of the creation , survival and implications of dust within the nuclear regions of agn has received much attention for several decades ( e.g. see laor & draine 1993 and references therein ) .",
    "unfortunately the use of the various reddening indicators in order to determine the column density of dust along the line  of  sight ( and which can then be compared to that observed in the x - ray regime ) rely upon making one or more assumptions .",
    "the primary assumption is of course that one knows the intrinsic value of the quantity from which the observed reddening is determined .",
    "if one knew the form of underlying continuum , multiwaveband continuum measurements could be applied in the optical  uv . however such a technique often suffers from a lack simultaneous observations ( as well as observational contamination of other spectral components ) .",
    "broad emission line ratios , in particular broad hydrogen lines , are poor reddening indicators since the lines are significantly affected by optical depth effects and there is no satisfactory theory to predict their intrinsic ratios ( netzer 1990 ) . clearly all techniques also require assumptions concerning the composition ( chemical and grain - size distribution ) of the dust itself , and well as the dust / gas mass ratio . with these points in mind , we consider only a single reddening indicator here ( resonance - absorption line studies in the uv / optical are also considered in ",
    "[ sec : xuvabso - disc ] , but there do not provide a direct diagnostic of the dust - phase material ) .",
    "18 shows @xmath27 ( defined as the mean ratio of the observed flux at 125  nm to that at 220  nm , determined as described in ",
    "[ sec : sample ] and listed in table  1 ) is shown against @xmath62 for the datasets for which model _",
    "c(ii ) _ was considered acceptable (  [ sec : ion_pc_emis ] ) .",
    "it can be seen that the majority of sources are consistent with @xmath318 , but that 3 datasets ( ngc  3227 , mcg-6 - 30 - 15(1,2 ) ) have values a factor @xmath166 lower .",
    "thus it is tempting to make the assumption that the intrinsic flux ratio and ( to a lesser extent ) @xmath26 , and thus @xmath319 is not necessarily a good indication of the underlying uv continuum .",
    "however , the use of the color here is only based on noting @xmath27 appears to be crudely constant ( within a factor @xmath320 ) for the majority of the objects considered . ]",
    "is in the range @xmath321 , with the @xmath27 lower in the case of ngc  3227 & mcg-6 - 30 - 15 due to reddening . also shown in fig .",
    "18 is the predicted @xmath27 assuming @xmath322 for various values of the _ difference _ between the optical depths at 125  nm and 220  nm ( where @xmath323 ) .",
    "it can be seen that ngc  3227 and mcg-6 - 30 - 15(1,2 ) are consistent with @xmath319 similar to the other objects if their fluxes at 125  nm and 220  nm are absorbed by a column density similar to that observed in the x - ray band _ and _ @xmath324 ( dashed line ) .",
    "interestingly , the standard galactic extinction curve ( for a 1:1.12 silicate : graphite mixture of dust grains with sizes @xmath325  nm , number density @xmath326 and total dust / gas mass ratio of @xmath327  see laor & draine 1993 and references therein ) gives @xmath328 close to this value ( @xmath329 ) .",
    "thus in the case of ngc  3227 and mcg-6 - 30 - 15(1,2 ) , and assuming a galactic dust / gas mass ratio , this uv color is consistent with reddening by a column density of dusty material similar to that inferred by the x - ray observations .",
    "there are several implications of these results .",
    "first , we consider the implications on the location of the dust and gas in the case of ngc  3227 and mcg-6 - 30 - 15 . the consistency between the @xmath62 derived from the x - ray absorption studies and the uv - reddening in the case of these two sources , assuming a reasonable dust / gas mass ratio , implies that the dust- and gas - phase material might occupy the same volume .",
    "if true , this allows us to place constraints on the location of this material based upon the survival of the dust . for a typical agn continuum of bolometric luminosity @xmath234 ( as defined in ",
    "[ sec : bolx ] ) , and assuming maximum equilibrium temperature of @xmath330  k , laor & draine find sublimation radii of @xmath331  light - days and @xmath332  light - days for graphite grains with @xmath333  cm and @xmath334  cm respectively .",
    "( silcate grains , with a slightly lower maximum equilibrium temperature ( @xmath335  k ) , have slightly larger values of @xmath336 . ) assuming @xmath337 , @xmath338  light - days and @xmath339  light - days for large graphite grains in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ( @xmath340 ) and ngc  3227 ( @xmath341 ) respectively .",
    "the corresponding value in the case of ngc  5548 ( @xmath342 ) is @xmath343  light - days for large graphite grains .",
    "the latest results from the intensive reverberation mapping of the broad emission line region ( belr ) in ngc  5548 have suggested lags of @xmath34414  days , with the lowest lags seen in the highest ionization lines ( e.g. korista et al 1995 and references therein ) . as first pointed out by netzer & laor ( 1993 ) , since both the radius of the belr and @xmath336 scale as @xmath345 we conclude dust can only survive ( i.e. in _ equilibrium _ ) at radii just beyond the belr in these objects .",
    "if the dust covers a substantial fraction of the belr , then it will attenuate the broad emission lines in these objects .",
    "for instance , assuming the same standard galactic extinction curve used above , @xmath346 at the energy of civ emission .",
    "thus from the values of @xmath62 found in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 and ngc  3227 , a broad cvi emission line is predicted to be totally absent in both sources , consistent with observations ( see e.g. courvoisier & paltani 1992 ) .",
    "the extinction in the optical is lower ( e.g. @xmath347 , @xmath348 ) but sufficient to attenuate @xmath880% and @xmath895% of the broad @xmath349 line , and @xmath350% and @xmath885% of the broad @xmath351 line in ngc  3227 and mcg-6 - 30 - 15 respectively ( again assuming the dusty absorber completely covers the entire belr ) .",
    "however it is clear from the value of @xmath336 above and the discussion in  [ sec : multi - mcg6 ] that dusty clouds can not survive at a sufficiently small radius that keplerian motion alone can offer an explanation of the short - timescale variability ( @xmath17  s ) in the oviii  edge observed in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "thus either the dusty absorber is extremely non - uniform and/or its kinematics are extremely non - keplerian , or ( far more likely ) the gas giving rise to the bulk of the oviii  edge is at much smaller radii than that with embedded dust . interestingly ngc  3227 and mcg-6 - 30 - 15 have the lowest axial ratios ( @xmath23 , table  1 ) in our sample , with the exception of the well - known , edge - on galaxy ic  4329a .",
    "we now consider the majority of the objects on our sample , for which @xmath27 provides no evidence for reddening .",
    "there are two obvious explanations .",
    "first , the column density of ionized gas within the cylinder  of  sight may simply not contain any embedded dust in these objects .",
    "this might arise from differences in the origin of the material , or as a result of the material in these objects being within @xmath336 . alternatively",
    "the dust may be present yet unobservable .",
    "this will true if the dust is of a different composition in which @xmath352 ( such as is the case if the grains are large ) , or if the dust clouds cover only a fraction of the uv emission region .      the presence of highly - ionized gas , instrinsic to the seyfert 1 nuclei is also obtained from observations carried out in the uv . _",
    "iue _ observations revealed only a small fraction ( @xmath83% ) of sources to exhibit narrow absorption lines close to the systemic velocity ( e.g. ulrich 1988 ) .",
    "however , recent results taking advantage of the higher spectral resolution and signal - to - noise ratio available with the fos and ghrs instruments onboard _ hst _ have revealed that up to 50% of seyfert 1 galaxies may in fact contain such absorption features ( e.g. crenshaw 1997 ) .",
    "such features have also been reported in _",
    "observations of ngc  4151 ( kriss et al .",
    "1992 ) and ngc  3516 ( kriss et al .",
    "furthermore variability in the uv absorption features have been observed on timescales of weeks  years in ngc  4151 ( bromage et al . 1985 ) , ngc  3783 ( maran et al 1996 ) , and ngc  3516 ( koratkar et al .",
    "1996 ) , and multiple radial velocity components have been reported in mrk  509 ( crenshaw , boggess & wu 1995 ) and ngc  3516 ( crenshaw , maran & mushotzky 1997 ) .    as noted by crenshaw ( 1997 )",
    ", there is a reassuring trend whereby seyfert 1 galaxies which have evidence for strong absorption features due to ionized gas in the x - ray band also tend to have strong absorption lines in the uv / optical .",
    "this raises the question as to whether the associated absorbers seen the uv / optical are caused by ( part or all of ) the same ionized material which gives rise to the absorption features observed in the x - ray band .",
    "the uv absorption components are often blueshifted with respect to the emission lines , but with velocity shifts ( typically @xmath8few@xmath353 ) too small to be detectable with current x - ray observations .",
    "thus direct tests for kinematic consistency are not yet possible",
    ". however various attempts have been made to relate the uv / optical and x - ray absorption features using photoionization calculations ( e.g. mathur 1994 ; mathur et al .",
    "1994 ; mathur , wilkes & elvis 1995 ; shields & hamann 1996 ; kriss et al 1996a , b ) .",
    "these have met with varying degrees of success , which is hardly surprizing given the uncertainties in the location and kinematics of the gas and the spectral form of the photoionizing continuum .",
    "nevertheless there have been a number of impressive successes linking the uv / optical and x - ray absorbers ( e.g. see mathur 1997 ) .",
    "the observed uv / optical absorption features are often superimposed on the wings of broad emission lines .",
    "this clearly places the gas responsible for these associated absorbers at radii greater than that where the bulk ( of the blue - wing ) of that emission line originates ( @xmath34414  light - days in the case of ngc  5548 ) .",
    "however ionized gas could exist at a wide range of radii , with only part of the gas responsible for the x - ray absorption within the cylinder  of  sight to the uv / optical emission line region(s ) .",
    "indeed the presence of multiple components to the uv / optical absorption features ( and the indication of additional absorption zones in the x - ray  e.g.  [ sec : disc-2ion ] ) clearly indicates a single screen of gas to be an over - simplification .",
    "thus the column densities implied by the uv / optical absorption features may be small ( and dominated by different ionization states ) compared to those implied from the x - ray features .",
    "furthermore , the emission and absorption features predicted in the uv / optical from the ionized gas are somewhat dependent on the form of the photoionizing continuum in the uv  x - ray band .",
    "this is poorly determined for all objects , leading to further ambiguities .",
    "in addition , in at least some objects the absorption features in both the uv and x - ray are known to vary with time . to date",
    ", most comparisons between the absorption features have been performed using non - simultaneous data , leading to obvious risk of deception .",
    "finally , there is the usual irritation of uncertainties in the abundances within the absorbing material .",
    "the best hope for progress is provided by intense , simultaneous monitoring of the uv / optical and x - ray absorption features .",
    "we have presented the systematic analysis of the 0.6 - 10 kev _ asca _ spectra of 18 seyfert 1 galaxies in order to examine the characteristics of x - ray absorption by ionized gas .",

    "the variability timescales for remaining spectral components differ , with that for the transmitted continuum determinded by the the variability timescale of the central source and/or the timescale over which significant changes in the absorbing column density occur within the cylinder  of  sight ( above ) .",
    "the timescales on which variations in the intensity of the scattered continuum and emission from the photoionized gas occur are determined by the light travel - times to the corresponding regions . if we assume that the rise in the 12  kev count rate observed by _ rosat _ is due to a brightening in the central source , then the lack of a corresponding increase @xmath472  kev seen in ngc  4151(4,5 ) implies these regions lie @xmath473  light - days .",

    "we note some soft flux is provided in our models which include emission but generally this is small ( except in the case of our model including a compton - reflection component ) .    in their analysis of the mean spectra from the ngc  7469(1,2 )",

    "a similar result was obtained by weaver et al ( 1995 ) from an independent analysis of these data , who suggested the source to be a bare seyfert 1 continuum with weak ( if any ) additional absorption or emission features .",
