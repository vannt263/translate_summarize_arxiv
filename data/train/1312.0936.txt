    "the kepler mission has found an abundance of planets with radii @xmath9 @xcite ; the most recent head - count indicates 3206 planet candidates in this size range ( nasa exoplanet archive , queried 15 jan .",
    "2014 ) , most of which are real @xcite .",
    "although there are no planets between the size of earth and neptune in the solar system , occurrence calculations that de - bias the orbital geometry and completeness of the kepler survey find that planets between the size of earth and neptune are common in our galaxy , occurring with orbital periods between 5 and 50 days around 24% of stars @xcite . however , in many systems , it is difficult to measure the masses of such small planets because the gravitational acceleration these planets induce on their host stars or neighboring planets is challenging to detect with current telescopes and instruments . we can not hope to measure the masses of all planets in this size range discovered by kepler .",
    "obtaining measurements of the masses of a subset of these planets and characterizing their compositions is vital to understanding the formation and evolution of this population of planets .",
    "many authors have explored the relation between planet mass and radius as a means for understanding exoplanet compositions and as a predictive tool . @xcite",
    "predict the mass - radius relationship for planets of various compositions .",
    "the mass - radius relation in @xcite , which is commonly used in literature to translate between planet masses and radii , is based on fitting a power law relation to earth and saturn only .",
    "other works , such as @xcite , determine empirical relations between mass and radius based on the exoplanet population .",
    "recent mass determinations of small planets motivate a new empirical mass - radius relation .",
    "restricting the empirical mass - radius relation to small exoplanets will improve the goodness of fit , allowing better mass predictions and enabling a superior physical understanding of the processes that drive the mass - radius relation for small planets .",
    "one challenge in determining a mass - radius relation for small planets is the large scatter in planet mass . at 2@xmath0 ,",
    "planets are observed to span a decade in density , from less dense than water to densities comparable to earth s .",
    "this scatter could result from measurement uncertainty or from compositional variety among low - mass exoplanets .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate mass - radius relationships for planets smaller than 4 earth radii .",
    "we explore how planet composition ",
    "rocky versus rich in volatiles influences the mass - radius relationship .",
    "we also investigate the extent to which system properties contribute to the scatter in the mass - radius relation by examining how these properties correlate with the residuals of the mass - radius relation .",
    "we present a judicious identification of small transiting planets with masses or mass upper limits measured via stellar radial velocities ( rvs ) or numerically modeled transit timing variations ( ttvs ) .",
    "the only selection criterion was that the exoplanets have @xmath10 and either a mass determination , a marginal mass determination , or a mass upper limit .",
    "there were no limits on stellar type , orbital period , or other system properties .",
    "we include all 19 planets smaller than 4@xmath0  with masses vetted on exoplanets.org , as of january 13 , 2013 .",
    "twelve of these masses are determined by rvs , but the masses of four kepler-11 planets , kepler-30 b , and two kepler-36 planets are determined by ttvs @xcite .",
    "we include five numerically - determined planet masses from ttvs not yet on exoplanets.org : three koi-152 ( kepler-79 ) planets @xcite , and two koi-314 planets @xcite .",
    "we also include all 40 transiting planets with rv follow - up in @xcite that are smaller than 4@xmath0 , and the rv - determined mass of koi-94 b @xcite , none of which yet appear on exoplanets.org .",
    "55 cnc e , corot-7 b , and gj 1214 b have been studied extensively , and we had to choose from the masses and radii reported in various studies . for 55 cnc e , we use @xmath11 , @xmath12 @xcite ; for corot-7 b , we use @xmath13 , @xmath14 @xcite , and for gj 1214 b , we use @xmath15 , @xmath16 @xcite . histograms of the distributions of planet radius , mass , and density are shown in figure [ fig : histograms ] , and the individual measurements of planet mass and radius are listed in table [ tab : mrf ] .",
    "the exoplanets all have @xmath17 days .",
    "this is because the transit probability is very low for planets at long orbital periods and because short - period planets are often favored for rv and ttv studies .",

    "although one might advocate for only studying planets with well - determined ( @xmath22 ) masses , imposing a significance criterion will bias the sample toward more massive planets at a given radius .",
    "this bias is especially pernicious for small planets , for which the planet - induced rv signal can be small ( @xmath23 ) compared to the noise from stellar activity ( @xmath24 ) and poisson photon noise ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "we must include the marginal mass detections and non - detections in order to minimize bias in planet masses at a given radius .",

    "they allow a negative semi - amplitude in the keplerian fit to the rvs and report the peak and 68@xmath25 percentiles of the posterior distribution of the semi - amplitude .",
    "the posterior distribution peak often corresponds to a  negative \" planet mass , although the wings of the posterior distribution encompass positive values .",
    "although planets can not have negative masses in nature , random fluctuations in the rvs from noise can produce a velocity curve that is low when it should be high , and high when it should be low , mimicking the rv signature of a planet 180@xmath26 out of phase with the transit - determined ephemeris .",
    "since the planetary ephemeris is fixed by the transit , @xcite allow these cases to be fit with a negative semi - amplitude solution in their mcmc analysis .",
    "reporting the peak of the posterior distribution is statistically meaningful because there are also cases where the fluctuations in rvs from the random noise happen to correlate with the planetary signal , artificially increasing the planet mass .",
    "we include non - detections ( as negative planet masses and low - significance positive planet masses ) to avoid statistical bias toward large planet masses at a given radius .",
    "including literature values , which typically only report planet mass if the planet mass is detected with high confidence , slightly biases our sample toward higher masses at a given radius .",

    "the weighted mean densities and masses guide the eye , demonstrating how the ensemble density and mass change with radius .",
    "we also include the solar system planets .",
    "examining the solar system terrestrial planets and the weighted mean density at 1.5 @xmath0 , we see that planet density increases with increasing radius up to 1.5 @xmath0 . for planets between 1.0 and 1.5 @xmath0",

    "the break in the density - radius relation motivates us to explore different empirical relations for planets smaller and larger than 1.5 @xmath0 .",

    "because there are so few planets with well - determined masses in this regime , we include the terrestrial solar system planets ( mercury , venus , earth , mars ) in a fit to the planets smaller than 1.5 @xmath0 .",
    "we impose uncertainties of 20% in their masses and 10% in their radii so that the solar system planets will contribute to , but not dominate , the fit . because the solar system planets appear to satisfy a linear relation between density and radius , we choose a linear fit to planet density vs. radius .",

    "the empirical density- and mass - radius relations and their goodness of fit are summarized in table [ tab : mr_relations ] .",
    "below , we discuss the implications of these relations for planet compositions .",
    "the peak of the density - radius relation at 1.5 @xmath0  and 8 @xmath1  is consistent with the @xcite prediction for the density of a 1.5 @xmath0  earth - composition planet .",
    "the density peak at 1.5 @xmath0  is also consistent with the division between rocky and non - rocky planets determined in @xcite through bayesian modeling and mcmc analysis .",
    "following the @xcite prediction for the density of an earth - composition ( 67.5% mgsio@xmath35 , 32.5% fe ) planet , we see a predicted increase in planet density with increasing planet radius .",
    "this is because rock is slightly compressible , causing an increase in density with increasing planet radius .",
    "because the compression of rock is slight , we could , in principle , take a first - order taylor expansion to the equation of state of a rocky planet and approximate that density increases linearly with radius ; this is consistent with our empirical , linear density - radius fit .",
    "if the exoplanets in this regime are indeed rocky , our inclusion of the solar system planets is justified because the orbital period ( out to earth s orbit ) and incident flux on a rocky planet should have very little effect on that planet s mass and radius .",
    "equation [ eqn : dr_lin_rocky ] and the density - radius relation from @xcite are both consistent with the interpretation that planets smaller that 1.5 @xmath0  are rocky , but equation [ eqn : dr_lin_rocky ] has advantages in that it ( a ) is empirical , and ( b ) passes closer to earth , venus , and mars , which are known to be rich in silicon and magnesium ( unlike mercury , which is iron - rich ) .",
    "additional and more precise , mass measurements for planets smaller than 1.5 @xmath0  are necessary to hone the density - radius relation below 1.5@xmath0  and examine any scatter about the relation .    for planets between 1.5 and 4 @xmath0 ,",
    "the weighted mean density decreases with increasing planet radius , making these planets inconsistent with a rocky composition . the decrease in density must be due to an increasing fraction of volatiles , which we argue must be at least partially in the form of h / he envelopes .",
    "the gentle rise in planet mass with increasing radius indicates a substantial change in volume ( from 3.4 to 64 times the volume of earth ) for very little change in mass ( from 4 to 10 earth masses ; see figure [ fig : rm_4 ] ) .",
    "a water layer alone can not explain this enormous change in volume for so little added mass ; lightweight gas must be present in increasing quantities with increasing planetary radius .",
    "we can do a thought experiment : if exoplanets at 4 @xmath0  ( which have densities of about 1 @xmath1 ) are made entirely of water , what distinguishes them from the 1.5 @xmath0  planets whose compositions are likely rocky ? we see no empirical evidence in the weighted mean density vs. radius that would suggest a shift between planets that do have rocky cores at 1.5 @xmath0 , and planets that do not have rocky cores at 4 @xmath0",
    ". moreover , planet formation theory makes it very likely that water content will be accompanied by at least a comparable amount of silicates and iron - nickel .",
    "the smooth decline in the weighted mean density from 1.5 to 4 @xmath0  seems more consistent with the accumulation of lightweight gaseous envelopes upon rocky cores .",
    "the moderate reduced @xmath36 ( 6.3 ) to the mass - radius relation between 1.5 and 4 @xmath0  indicates that measurement errors do not explain the variation in planet mass at a given radius .",
    "only a diversity of planet compositions at given radius explains the large scatter in planet mass .",
    "perhaps the mass diversity at a given radius results from different core masses in planets with large gaseous envelopes ( as argued in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the size of the planet is determined by the fraction of gas , but the mass is determined by the size of the rocky core .",
    "in addition , water layers between the rocky cores and gaseous envelopes could help account for the scatter in mass at a given radius .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite suggest that the mass - radius relation is more like @xmath37 for small exoplanets .",
    "however , these studies include saturn or saturn - like planets at the high - mass end of their  small planet \" populations .",
    "such planets are better described as part of the giant planet population and are not useful in determining an empirical mass - radius relation of predictive power for small exoplanets .    in a study of planets with @xmath38 , @xcite find @xmath39 in a sample of 22 pairs of planets that exhibit strong anti - correlated ttvs in the _ kepler _ data .",
    "our independent assessment of 65 exoplanets , 52 of which are not analyzed in @xcite , is consistent with this result for planets larger than 1.5@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite note that a linear relation between planet mass and radius is dimensionally consistent with a constant escape velocity from the planet ( i.e. @xmath40 ) .",
    "the linear mass - radius relation might result from photo - evaporation of the atmospheres of small planets near their stars @xcite .",

    "* ) . a t - test comparing the residual masses from the rvs to the ttvs results in a two - tailed p - value of 0.03 , indicating the two samples , if drawn from the same distribution , would be this discrepant 3% of the time .",
    "an empirical fit between only the rv - determined planet masses and their radii for @xmath42 yields a similar solution to equation [ eqn : mr_plaw ] , but predicts slightly higher masses and less scatter of the residuals : @xmath43 , reduced @xmath44    the systematic difference between the ttv and rv masses is unlikely to stem from a bias in the rvs .",
    "either the ttvs are systematically underestimating planet masses ( possibly because other planets in the system damp the ttvs ) , or compact systems amenable to detection through ttvs have lower - density planets than non - compact systems ( e.g. the kepler-11 system , * ? ? ?",
    "that @xcite also find @xmath45 suggests that the ttv masses might be reliably systematically lower , although @xcite use analytic rather than numerical methods to estimate planet masses .",

    "the quantities we correlate against are : planet orbital period , planet semi - major axis , the incident flux from the star on the planet , stellar mass , stellar radius , stellar surface gravity , stellar metallicity , stellar age , and stellar velocity times the sine of the stellar spin axis inclination ( which are obtained through exoplanets.org or the papers cited in table [ tab : mrf ] ) . in these data ,",
    "the residual mass does not strongly correlate with any of these properties .",
    "we find possible evidence of a correlation between residual planet mass and stellar metallicity for planets smaller than 4@xmath0 .",
    "the pearson r - value of the correlation is 0.25 , resulting in a probability of 7% that the residual planet mass and stellar metallicity are not correlated , given the residual masses and metallicities .",
    "however , given that we looked for correlations among 9 pairs of variables , the probability of finding a @xmath46 confidence correlation in any of the 9 trials due to random fluctuation is @xmath47 , meaning there is only a 55% chance that the apparent metallicity correlation is real .",

    "planets smaller than 1.5@xmath0  are consistent with a linear density - radius relation , and are also consistent with the @xcite earth composition curve . above 1.5@xmath0 ,",
    "the decrease in planet density with increasing radius can only be due to the inclusion of volatiles , and so planets larger than 1.5 @xmath0  are generally inconsistent with a purely rocky composition . among planets larger than 1.5@xmath0 ,",
    "the gentle rise in planet mass with increasing radius indicates a substantial change in radius for very little change in mass , suggesting that lightweight h / he gas is present in increasing quantities with increasing planetary radius ."
