    "the dependence of the refractive index versus strain in silica glass , namely the photoelasticity , is of interest from the fundamental point of view as well as for several technological applications in optics and microelectronics .",
    "for instance , photoelasticity in a - sio@xmath2 is known to cause a reduction of fiber bragg gratings efficiency @xcite and to produce a loss of resolution of pure silica lenses used in photolytography @xcite . despite its widespread interest , a microscopic and quantitative modeling of",
    "photoelasticity in amorphous silica is still lacking .    in this paper ,",
    "we have computed the photoelastic tensor of crystalline and amorphous silica by first principles within density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt ) @xcite aiming at identifying the microscopic properties which rule the photoelastic response in silica systems .",
    "models of amorphous silica containing up to 162 atoms have been generated by quenching from the melt in combined classical and car - parrinello molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "photoelastic coefficients of quartz have been computed previously within dfpt by detraux and gonze @xcite , who found good agreement with experimental data . from the change of effective charges of oxygen upon strain , the latter authors have suggested that an important contribution to photoelasticity in quartz comes from the dependence of oxygen polarizability on the deformation of the siosi angles upon strain .    in this paper",
    "we have enlarged the scope of the previous work by detraux and gonze @xcite by computing the photoelastic coefficients of a - sio@xmath2 and of several crystalline phases ( quartz , @xmath0-cristobalite , @xmath1-cristobalite ) at normal conditions and at high pressure from first principles .",
    "comparison with available experimental data and with calculations including a scissor correction to the electronic band gap , let us conclude that the simple local density approximation to dfpt is suitable to well reproduce the experimental photoelastic tensor , despite a large error ( 10 @xmath3 ) in the dielectric constants .",
    "the ab - initio photoelastic coefficients of the crystalline phases of silica provided us with a database over which a phenomenological model of the dielectric response has been fitted .",
    "this model aided us in the interpretation of the ab - initio results on the photoelastic properties of amorphous silica .",
    "as described below , we have confirmed on a quantitative basis that the dependence of the anisotropic oxygen polarizability on the sisi angle is the key parameter for modeling the dielectric and photoelastic properties of silica .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe our computational framework . in section",
    "iii we report on a preliminary test of our framework on the photoelastic tensor of si and mgo as prototypes of covalent and ionic materials . in section",
    "iv we report our results on the photoelastic coefficients and structural response to strains of several crystalline phases of silica : quartz at ambient conditions and high pressure , @xmath0-cristobalite , and @xmath1-cristobalite . in section",
    "v , we first report the details of the protocols used to generate the models of a - sio@xmath2 .",
    "analysis of their structural and elastic properties are given .",
    "then the calculated photoelastic tensor for a - sio@xmath2 is discussed and compared with experimental data . in section vi we present a phenomenological model of the dielectric properties of silica that we have fitted on the dielectric tensor of @xmath0-cristobalite at different densities .",
    "its transferability was proven by comparison with the ab - initio database on the dielectric and photoelastic tensors of the crystalline and amorphous systems presented in the preceding sections .",
    "finally , section vii is devoted to discussion and conclusions .",
    "we have used density functional theory in the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite , norm conserving pseudopotentials for oxygen @xcite and silicon @xcite and plane - waves expansion of the kohn - sham ( ks ) orbitals up to a kinetic cutoff of 70 ry , if not specified otherwise .",
    "the structure of the crystalline phases has been determined by optimizing all the structural parameters .",
    "monkhorst - pack ( mp ) @xcite meshes have been used in the integration of the brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "the calculations on the crystalline phases have been performed by using the code pwscf @xcite .",
    "models of a - sio@xmath2 have been generated by quenching from the melt in classical molecular dynamics simulations using the empirical potential by van beest _",
    "@xcite which has been shown to properly describe the structural and dynamical properties of amorphous silica @xcite .",
    "we have slightly modified the interatomic potential of ref .",
    "@xcite for short si - o and o - o separations by adding a term of the form @xmath4 with @xmath5 and @xmath6 for si - o interactions and @xmath7 and @xmath8 for o - o interactions .",
    "the modified potential turned out to be necessary to describe the high - temperature liquid ( above 5000 k ) where ions with opposite charges may approach each other very closely and fall in the well of the coulomb potential in the absence of the additional repulsion here introduced .",
    "this new term does not change the structural properties of crystalline and amorphous phases .",
    "the simulations have been performed at constant volume .",
    "ab - initio annealing of the models at 600 @xmath9 for 0.75 ps has been then performed by car - parrinello @xcite molecular dynamics simulation as implemented in the code cpmd @xcite .",
    "we have generated two amorphous models containing 81 and 162 atoms .",
    "different quenching and annealing protocols have been used as discussed in section v. integration of the bz has been restricted to the @xmath10 point only in the car - parrinello simulations .",
    "a fictitious electronic mass of 800 and a time step of 0.15 fs have been used . in the dynamical car - parrinello simulations",
    "we have used an ultrasoft pseudopotential @xcite for oxygen and a lower cutoff of 27 ry .",
    "the structures generated by car - parrinello simulations have been then optimized with norm - conserving pseudopotentials to study the dielectric properties .",
    "we have computed the dielectric and photoelastic tensors within density functional perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the photoelastic tensor @xmath11 is defined by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the optical dielectric tensor and @xmath14 is the strain tensor . only the electronic contribution",
    "is included in @xmath13 , also indicated as @xmath15 .",
    "experimentally , it corresponds to the dielectric response measured for frequencies of the applied field much higher than lattice vibrational frequencies , but lower than the frequencies of the electronic transitions .",
    "the photoelastic coefficients have been calculated by finite differences from the dielectric tensor of systems with strains from -2 @xmath3 to + 2 @xmath3 .",
    "the independent components of @xmath11 ( 21 in general ) can be reduced by the symmetry of the system . in quartz for instance",
    "there are only eight independent coefficients which can be determined by applying three types of strain @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the components of the photoelastic tensor will be expressed hereafter in the compressed voigt notation .",
    "the dielectric tensor for the different strained configurations has been calculated within dfpt @xcite , as implemented in the code pwscf and phonons @xcite . however , the largest amorphous model considered here which contains 162 atoms turned out intractable within the latter framework .",
    "therefore , we have also computed the dielectric tensor within the berry phase ( bp ) approach to the electronic polarization @xcite as developed by putrino _",
    "_ @xcite . in these latter calculations",
    "we have restricted the bz integration to the @xmath10-point only .",
    "this latter technique converges to the correct dfpt result in the limit of large simulation cells or equivalent k - points mesh , although with a different pace with respect to standard dfpt .",
    "how large should the system be to reproduce the correct result within the bp approach has been investigated for @xmath1-cristobalite in section ivc below .",
    "it turns out that for system size of the order of 192 atoms and the @xmath10-point only , the error in the photoelastic coefficients of @xmath1-cristobalite are of the same order of the errors introduced by the lda .",
    "photoelasticity of the largest model of a - sio@xmath2 in section v has been addressed within the bp approach as implemented in the code cpmd @xcite .",
    "the exchange - correlation functionals available in literature ( lda and generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) ) usually underestimate the electronic band gap and overestimate the electronic dielectric tensor up to 10 - 15 @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy can be corrected semi - empirically by applying a self - energy correction , also referred to as a scissor correction , which consists of a rigid shift of the conduction bands with respect to the valence bands @xcite .",
    "this procedure has been used successfully to reproduce the photoelasticity of si @xcite , gaas @xcite and quartz @xcite .",
    "however , as shown in section iii and iv , it turns out that even within simple lda , the error in the photoelastic coefficients is smaller than what expected on the basis of the error in the dielectric constant itself .",
    "the scissor correction has thus been neglected in the calculations on amorphous silica and on crystalline phases at high pressure .",
    "the calculations with the scissor corrections have been performed with the code abinit @xcite .",
    "as test cases of our theoretical framework , prior to the application to silica , we have computed the photoelastic coefficients of crystalline silicon and mgo as prototypes of covalent and ionic systems , respectively .      we have computed the photoelastic tensor for the conventional cubic supercell containing eight atoms .",
    "the dielectric tensor has only one component and there are three photoelastic coefficients , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 independent by symmetry .",
    "a 8x8x8 mp mesh over the bz corresponding to 20 k - points in the irreducible wedge is used .",
    "the ks states are expanded in plane waves up to a kinetic cutoff of 20 ry .",
    "the photoelastic coefficients , computed at the theoretical equilibrium lattice constant ( @xmath22  ) , are reported in table [ silicon ] and compared with previous results obtained by levine et al .",
    "these authors computed the photoelastic coefficients at the experimental lattice parameter ( @xmath23  ) within simple lda and by adding a scissor operator , corresponding to a rigid shift of 0.7 ev of the conduction band with respect to the valence band .",
    "although the scissor correction is crucial to reproduce the dielectric constant of silicon , it produces small changes in the photoelastic tensor both at the experimental and at the theoretical equilibrium densities . on the other hand ,",
    "the photoelastic coefficients are strongly dependent on the lattice constant ( cfr .",
    "table [ silicon ] ) .",
    "better agreement with experiments is achieved when the theoretical lattice parameter is used .",
    "this conclusion is also true for the calculation of the piezoelectric tensor in other materials @xcite .",
    ".dielectric constant and photoelastic coefficients of crystalline silicon .",
    "results obtained by simple lda and by adding a scissor correction of 0.7 ev are compared .",

    "photoelasticity of crystalline and amorphous silica has been studied by density functional perturbation theory .",
    "this framework has been checked successfully first on paradigmatic semiconducting and insulating systems , silicon and mgo .",
    "the same framework has been applied to @xmath0-quartz providing photoelastic constants in good agreement with previous calculations @xcite and with experiments .",
    "the photoelastic coefficients have been computed also for @xmath0-quartz under pressure up to 7 gpa , and for @xmath0-cristobalite and @xmath1-cristobalite at normal conditions .",
    "the theoretical results obtained for these latter systems are predictions open to experimental verification .",
    "we have thus verified that the simple dfpt - lda framework is suitable to reproduce accurately the photoelastic coefficients .",
    "correction of the dft - lda band gap by a scissor operator is necessary to reproduce the dielectric constants but has minor effects on the photoelastic tensor .",
    "we have then studied photoelasticity for models of amorphous silica , containing up to 162 atoms , generated by quenching from the melt in molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "the calculated photoelastic coefficients are in good agreement with experimental data .",
    "our ab - initio framework has thus valuable predictive power also for the amorphous phase .",
    "along with the calculated photoelastic coefficients , we have collected data on the structural response to strain of different crystalline phases .",
    "the analysis of these data has aided us in the development of a phenomenological model of photoelasticity in silica polymorphs .",
    "in fact the analysis of the structural changes upon strain has shown that silica responds to strain mainly via rotations of the tetrahedral units ( thus changing the si -  - si angles ) with smaller changes of the intra - tetrahedral ( o-@xmath24-o ) angles .",
    "for instance , the most prominent effect of tensile stress is the alignment of the si - o - si units to the direction parallel to the strain axis .",
    "these results suggested us to model the dielectric properties of silica polymorphs in terms of si - o - si polarizable units with polarizability dependent on the si -  - si angle only . at this aim",
    "we have developed a phenomenological model fitted on the dielectric constant of @xmath0-cristobalite at different densities .",
    "the model consists of polarizable oxygen ions with anisotropic polarizability dependent on the si -  - si angle .",
    "the validity of the model has been proven by comparing dielectric and photoelastic coefficients computed within the phenomenological model to the results of dfpt calculations .",
    "the agreement is good and the simple phenomenological model sheds light on the main contributions to photoelasticity in silica polymorphs .",
    "it turns out that the change in the oxygen polarizability with strain , via the sisi angle is essential to reproduce the photoelastic response .",
    "the neglect of this term introduces errors of up to 50 @xmath3 .",
    "secondly , the difference in the diagonal and off - diagonal photoelastic coefficients ( e.g. @xmath19 and @xmath25 ) , which is particularly large in a - sio@xmath2 , is due to the alignment of the siosi units along the axis of tensile strain . finally , while local fields beyond the lorentz - lorent approximation ( via dipole - dipole interactions ) and their change upon to strain are important to reproduce the dielectric and photoelastic properties ( expecially birefringence ) of the low - symmetry crystalline phases , they are obviously negligible for a - sio@xmath2 .",
    "this result confirms that our models of a - sio@xmath2 , despite their small size , are already good model of a homogeneous isotropic amorphous network .    in summary , our work has demonstrated the reliability of the ab - initio dft - lda framework in the study of photoelasticity of silica systems and has provided a phenomenological model of the dielectric properties transferable to several crystalline and amorphous polymorphs .",
    "the same ab - initio framework , supplemented by the phenomelogial model , could also provide a microscopic description of the photoelasic properties of more complex silica - based glasses .",
