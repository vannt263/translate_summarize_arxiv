    "the low - energy supergravity limits of superstring theory as well as d - brane effective actions receive infinite sets of correction terms , proportional to increasing powers of @xmath1 and induced by superstring theory massless and massive modes . at present",
    ", eleven - dimensional supergravity lacks a corresponding microscopic underpinning that could similarly justify the presence of higher - derivative corrections to the classical cremmer - julia - scherk action @xcite",
    ". nevertheless , some corrections of this kind are calculable from unitarity arguments and super - ward identities in the massless sector of the theory @xcite or by anomaly cancellation arguments @xcite .",
    "supersymmetry puts severe constraints on higher - derivative corrections .",
    "for example , it forbids the appearance of certain corrections ( like , e.g , @xmath2 corrections to supergravity effective actions @xcite ) , and groups terms into various invariants @xcite .",
    "the structure of the invariants that contain anomaly - cancelling terms is of great importance due to the quantum nature of the anomaly - cancellation mechanism and is the main concern of this note .",
    "higher - derivative additions to the supergravity actions are in general compatible with supersymmetry only if the transformation rules for the fields also receive higher - derivative corrections : @xmath3 as a consequence , the field - dependent structure coefficients on the right - hand side of the supersymmetry algebra , @xmath4= \\delta^{\\text{translation } } +   \\delta^{\\text{susy } } + \\delta^{\\text{gauge } } +   \\delta^{\\text{lorentz } } \\ , , \\ ] ] will be modified as well . when the theory is formulated in superspace the structure of the algebra",
    "is related to the structure of the tangent bundle , the link being provided by the constraints on the superspace torsion . in particular , corrections to the parameters modify the superspace constraints . however , since some corrections are reabsorbable by suitable rotations of the tangent bundle basis , not all corrections are physical .",
    "we report here on the supersymmetrisation of the anomaly - related terms @xmath5 for super - maxwell theory coupled to @xmath6=1 supergravity in ten dimensions and @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 ) in eleven dimensions performed in @xcite .",
    "while the former does not require any corrections to the superspace constraints , there are strong indications based on a previous superspace analysis  @xcite that the latter does induce such modifications .",
    "however , we show that there are no such corrections which are proportional to ( powers of ) the weyl tensor only .",
    "we present here only the more salients aspect of the analysis and refer to the article @xcite for computational and bibliographical details .    our main motivation to look for non - trivial corrections to superspace constraints comes from the link between these constraints and the kappa symmetry of m - branes @xcite and d - branes @xcite .",
    "classical kappa invariance of the m- and d - brane world - volume actions  a key requirement for these objects to be supersymmetric  imposes the on - shell constraints on the background superspace supergravity fields , among them the superspace torsion . for this reason , any non - trivial modification to the constraints",
    "is expected to require new terms in the world - volume actions for the branes in order for kappa symmetry to be preserved .",
    "as a first step in our analysis of the implications of higher - derivative corrections to the supersymmetry algebra , we discuss the construction of the abelian @xmath10 for @xmath6=1 super - maxwell theory coupled to gravity in ten dimensions .",
    "the field content of the on - shell super - maxwell theory comprises an abelian vector @xmath11 and a negative - chirality majorana - weyl spinor @xmath12 .",
    "since we are interested in local supersymmetry invariance we have to take into account also the interactions with the zehnbein @xmath13 , the negative - chirality majorana - weyl gravitino @xmath14 and the two - form @xmath15 from the supergravity multiplet .",
    "the classical action ( leaving out the gravitational sector ) @xmath16\\ ] ] is invariant under the local supersymmetry transformations @xmath17 for local supersymmetry we have to consider the transformations of the supergravity multiplet fields as well ( neglecting terms proportional to the two - form @xmath15 and the corresponding field strength , @xmath18 ) : @xmath19}\\ , .\\ ] ] the @xmath9 action invariant under the local supersymmetry transformations listed above has been determined previously  @xcite and extends the globally supersymmetric action of  @xcite . using additional string input ,",

    "it can be argued that in the completely general ansatz for the dimension - zero torsion constraint @xmath35 the coefficient @xmath36 can be set equal to @xmath37 and all fully antisymmetric tensors contained in @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be set to zero by a choice of tangent bundle basis ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "therefore , from the component - field analysis of the previous section we conclude that the higher - order invariant  ( [ e : elevendimi_x ] ) does not induce any modifications to the torsion constraint  ( [ e : quantumtorsion ] ) .",
    "howe has shown in  @xcite that by imposing _",
    "only _ the constraint  ( [ e : classical ] ) , the full classical , on - shell , eleven - dimensional supergravity theory of @xcite follows .",
    "hence , we conclude from the absence of corrections to  ( [ e : quantumtorsion ] ) induced by the @xmath0 invariant  ( [ e : elevendimi_x ] ) , that any non - trivial m - theory corrections to the classical supergravity theory requires the inclusion of the four - form field strength .",
    "in addition , one may get such corrections from the inclusion of the @xmath43 interaction , which at the level of our analysis is part of a separate superinvariant and has therefore not been taken into account yet .",
    "one can argue , on the basis of lifting of the type iia action  @xcite , that this @xmath43 term should be present in the eleven - dimensional theory as well , but it is interesting to note that our results give another strong indication that this term should be present .",
    "otherwise our analysis , when combined with howe s , would imply that the dynamics encoded in the action  ( [ e : elevendimi_x ] ) does not correspond to any non - trivial corrections to the classical supergravity theory of  @xcite for configurations with vanishing four - form field strength .    in this context ,",
    "let us also mention that in parallel with our component - field based approach to uncover the superspace underlying m - theory , a complementary line of attack based on an analysis of the superspace bianchi identities has been initiated by cederwall et al .  in  @xcite .",
