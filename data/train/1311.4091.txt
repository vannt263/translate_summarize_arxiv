    "system identification is a field lying at the overlap between control theory and statistical inference @xcite .",
    "the typical system identification problem is that of estimating certain parameters of a dynamical system by designing input signals , while monitoring and analysing the corresponding output signals .",
    "similar problems arise in quantum engineering , where the task may be to estimate a quantum channel @xcite , the hamiltonian of a quantum system @xcite , or the lindblad generator of an open dynamical system in the markov approximation @xcite . by analogy",
    ", we expect that quantum system identification will play an important role in quantum control theory and the development of new quantum technologies .",
    "this paper deals with the following scenario , which is distinct from the channel estimation set - up .",
    "an open quantum system interacts weakly with the environment which is monitored by means of continuous time measurements ; the measurement output is used to estimate a dynamical parameter @xcite , for instance the system - environment interaction strength . in the markov approximation ,",
    "the joint dynamics is described in the quantum input - output formalism , by means of quantum stochastic differential equations @xcite .",
    "the output measurement process carries information about the dynamics and can be analysed using statistical inference tools .",
    "in particular , using the quantum trajectories formalism one can compute the likelihood of a measurement trajectory , and estimate the the unknown parameter by applying e.g. maximum likelihood , or bayesian inference methods .",
    "the discrete - time version of this set - up was analysed in @xcite which shows that both the output quantum state , and the average statistics of repeated measurements are asymptotically normal ( gaussian ) , and provides explicit expressions for the corresponding quantum and classical fisher informations ( cf . for a more general treatment ) . in continuous - time , a similar analysis was undertaken in @xcite for the particular model of the atom maser : a cavity interacting with incoming identically prepared two - levels atoms which are subsequently measured to produce a continuous - time counting process , as illustrate in figure [ fig.atommaser ] .",
    "one of the intriguing findings was that for certain values of the unknown parameter ( the rabi angle @xmath0 ) , the total atom counts are poor statistics ( zero classical fisher information ) , while the _ quantum _ fisher information of the output attains its maximum .",
    "here we extend this analysis in two directions .",
    "firstly , we apply the maximum likelihood estimation method ( mle ) to the full atom detection record , rather than the total counts statistics as in @xcite .",
    "this is done by computing the likelihood of a detection record using the quantum trajectories formalism .",
    "the estimated classical fisher information is illustrated in figure [ fig : mle ] in comparison with that of the total counts statistics .",
    "the significant discrepancy between the two informations in the region around @xmath1 motivated a further investigation aimed at finding more informative statistics , and other estimation methods which may be less computationally demanding than mle .    with this in mind , in the second part of the paper we introduce and analyse a set of 7 statistics such as waiting times between successive detections of a given type ( ground or excited state ) , number of successive detections of the same type , and density of detections of a given type before a detection of the other type .",
    "a strong dependence on @xmath0 of the statistic s distribution indicates that it is informative about the parameter .",
    "however , likelihood - based estimation for such statistics is typically as involved as performing mle on the full measurement data .",
    "therefore we employ a ` likelihood - free ' method known as approximate bayesian computation ( abc ) which works as follows ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : abc ] for details ) . a large number of measurement trajectories",
    "are _ simulated _ for each parameter value chosen from a given interval with uniform probability , and each sample is accepted if the value of the corresponding statistic is ` sufficiently close ' to that of the same statistic for the ` measurement data ' .",
    "the histogram of accepted samples is an approximation of the posterior distribution of @xmath0 given the summary statistic(s ) used in the abc procedure , and the accuracy can be controlled by a rejection threshold parameter .    when applied to _ individual _ statistics the method produces posterior distribution with significantly larger variance that the mle .",
    "however , when _",
    "all _ statistics are taken into account simultaneously , the abc performance is very close to that of the mle of the full measurement data , as illustrate in figure [ fig : alltogether ] .",
    "this shows that ` most ' information about @xmath0 is captured by a small number of appropriately chosen statistics , which is one of the main insights of the paper .",
    "we therefore anticipate that likelihood - free methods such as abc can be a valuable alternative to standard mle in models where the likelihood function is unknown or difficult to compute , while sampling the measurement process at given parameters is relatively easier .    in section [ atom.maser ]",
    "we introduce the atom maser model and the quantum trajectories formalism , and present an algorithm for simulating the different stochastic processes .",
    "section [ sec.statistical.inference ] gives a brief overview of the statistical concepts employed in the paper : fisher information for independent data and markov processes , asymptotic normality , the maximum likelihood estimator , the abc method for producing an approximate posterior distribution .",
    "section [ sec.results ] contains the main results of the paper .",
    "we discuss several measurement scenarios and their associated classical fisher informations , in particular the fisher information of the total number of atom counts statistics is compared to that of the full atoms measurement data , cf .",
    "figure [ fig : mle ] .",
    "we then consider several atom measurements statistics , such as waiting times , number of successive detections of the same type , total number of detections of the same type , and apply the abc procedure for each of them separately , and jointly for several statistics .",
    "we consider the standard atom maser model @xcite which consists of a beam of two - level atoms passing through and interacting resonantly with the electromagnetic field of a dissipative cavity , cf .",
    "figure [ fig.atommaser ] .",
    "the incoming atoms are prepared in the excited state , have equal velocities and their arrival times are poisson distributed with a given rate @xmath2 .",
    "the atom - field interaction is of jaynes - cummings type @xcite , and the cavity is in contact with a low temperature thermal bath such that the field can both emit or absorb photons with given rates .",
    "following @xcite we assume that at any moment of time at most one atom is present in the cavity .",
    "this leads to a coarse grained continuous time master evolution of the cavity as described below .",
    "the atoms emerging from the cavity are detected and measured in the standard basis .",
    "this continuous - time measurement produces a record of successive detection times , each time carrying the label of the measurement outcome ( @xmath3 for ground and @xmath4 for excited state ) .    .",
    "the outgoing atoms are measured in standard basis producing a detection record @xmath5,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    the goal is to infer the unknown value of the atom - field interaction strength , or more precisely the accumulated rabi angle , from the stochastic measurement record on a long time interval .",
    "the key differences with the channel tomography set - up are that we do not measure the system ( cavity ) directly , and we do not perform repeated independent measurements , but use a single - shot , time - correlated measurement record to infer the unknown parameter . for sufficiently long times",
    ", the cavity reaches its unique steady state , and the measurement process is stationary . in this regime",
    "one can compute the fisher information for certain _ statistics _ of the measurement data and prove their asymptotic normality @xcite . here",
    "we complete this analysis by investigating and comparing the maximum likelihood estimator based on the _ full _ measurement record , and the alternative _ likelihood - free _ method of approximate bayesian computation , based on a set of measurement statistics .",
    "although it may be practically unrealistic , for comparison purposes it is useful to consider thought experiments where in addition to the atoms measurement , the photons emitted and absorbed by the cavity , are also detected .",
    "other scenarios that will not be considered here but may be investigated in a similar fashion , include the detection of outgoing atoms in different basis ( phase - sensitive measurements ) @xcite , imperfect measurements , and atom masers with different pumping statistics @xcite .",
    "assuming that the time scale of the atom - cavity interaction is much smaller than both the decay time of the field and the typical inter - arrival time of the atoms , the cavity dynamics is governed by the master equation @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 are the four operators @xmath8 corresponding to the possible quantum jumps .",
    "the first two describe jumps induced by the detection of an atom in the ground and respectively excited state , while the last two are due to photon emission and absorption , with @xmath9and @xmath10 the creation and annihilation operators of the cavity field , and @xmath11 the photon absorption rate .",
    "the unique stationary state of the master dynamics satisfies @xmath12 , and the density matrix @xmath13 is diagonal in the fock basis , with coefficients given by @xmath14}.\\ ] ]    figure [ fig.stationarystate ] shows the stationary photon number distribution and the mean photon number , as a function of the rabi angle @xmath0 .",
    "the distribution has several features which are relevant for our investigation .",
    "firstly , it is multi - stable at certain values of @xmath0 , e.g. it exhibits bistability for @xmath15 and the mean photon number changes abruptly around @xmath16 . as we will see below , this is reflected in the fact that the quantum trajectories alternate between long periods of high and low photon numbers corresponding to active and passive periods of ground - state atoms detections .",
    "secondly , the mean photon number peaks at @xmath17 , so that parameters which are close to this point and are situated symmetrically with respect to it have similar mean photon numbers and are harder to distinguish statistically . at very low temperatures",
    "the stationary state exhibits other interesting features such as trapping @xcite .     at @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the black curve represents the cavity mean photon number.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      from the master dynamics level , we pass to that of quantum trajectories which describes the stochastic evolution of the cavity conditional on the atom ( or photon ) detection events .",
    "generally , quantum trajectories are solutions of stochastic schrdinger equations @xcite , or filtering equations @xcite driven by the _ stochastic _",
    "measurement process ; the _ deterministic _ dynamics on the master level can then be recovered by averaging over measurement trajectories . in this work ,",
    "the quantum trajectories are mainly used as a tool for investigating the statistical properties of the measurement process , but we envisage that they would play a more significant role in a scenario where the measurement strategy is optimised and includes feedback control .    during the interaction with the cavity the atoms",
    "are entangled with the cavity field , and are subsequently detected in either the ground or the excited state .",
    "we assume an ideal measurement process , i.e. all atoms are detected , and each atom undergoes a von neumann projective measurement , and we refer to @xcite for a more general set - up including undetected atoms and measurement errors .",
    "we will start by describing a ` full environment monitoring ' scenario where we assume that besides the atoms , the emitted and absorbed photons are also detected .",
    "after that we will focus on the more realistic situation where only the atoms are detected , which can be seen as ` tracing over ' the photon detection events .    whenever an atom is detected in the ground state ,",
    "the cavity performs a quantum jump from the current state @xmath20 to the new state @xmath21 similarly , we define the jump superoperators @xmath22 corresponding to the detection of a ground - state atom , the emission and absorption of a photon . between two successive detections",
    "the cavity state evolves continuously as @xmath23 which is equivalent to an evolution with the ` effective hamiltonian ' @xmath24 , on the level of pure states .",
    "a general feature of continuous - time measurements where the environment is fully monitored , is that the system dynamics can be run solely on pure states , thus reducing the overhead in computer simulations . in the case of the atom maser",
    ", the complexity can be further reduced by noticing that if the cavity is initially in a fock state , it will always jump up or down the fock ladder in a classical fashion .",
    "the corresponding stochastic dynamics is that of a birth and death process with rates @xcite @xmath25 figure [ fig : bistability ] shows a particular realisation of this dynamics where the pumping rate has been chosen such that the stationary state is bistable .",
    "the quantum trajectory ( left panel ) exhibits long periods of evolution inside either the high or the low photon phases , with quick jumps between them .",
    "this behaviour is mirrored by the total number of ground - state atoms statistic which alternates between active and passive dynamical phases @xcite .",
    ", @xmath26 ) the state spends long periods in ` phases ' with distinct mean photon numbers , with quick ` jumps ' between the phases .",

    "since in this case the dynamics is obtained by averaging over all unobserved photon events , the cavity state will be generally mixed and needs to be described by a density matrix .",
    "the jump superoperators @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the same as above , but the the evolution between jumps has generator @xmath29 which replaces @xmath30 , and takes into account all photon events @xmath31 let @xmath32 be a sequence of detection events occurring after the initial time @xmath33 , and let @xmath34 be the jump type for the atom detected at time @xmath35 .",

    "we are primarily interested in the long time behaviour when the dynamics looses memory of the initial cavity state and therefore , we can assume that its initial state is the stationary state @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , since the jump operators preserve the set of diagonal states , the probability @xmath44})$ ] can be computed by restricting the attention to such states , rather than full density matrices .",

    "one can find the asymptotically optimal solution for a given loss function ( figure of merit ) which is locally quadratic in @xmath89 , but in general the optimal measurements for different loss functions are incompatible with each other @xcite .",
    "a theory extending the concept of asymptotic normality to the quantum set - up has been developed in , where it is shown how the @xmath69 samples model converges to a quantum gaussian model with unknown mean and fixed covariance matrix . in this way the original estimation problem can be transformed into the simpler problem of estimating the mean of a gaussian state .      in this paper",

    "two extreme scenarios can be considered .",
    "on the one hand , the experimenter can perform identical repeated measurements on the output , and use the _ average _ of the results to estimate the unknown parameter .",

    "we fill this gap , and complement and compare it with a likelihood - free method which uses a small number of statistics of the data , such as waiting time distribution and average number of successive detections of the same type .",
    "the details of this method are described in the next section .",
    "similarly to the frequentist setting , bayesian inference requires a sampling space @xmath80 and a likelihood @xmath124 , which can be seen as the conditional distribution of the data @xmath125 given the parameter @xmath89 .",
    "additionally , the bayesian approach places a prior distribution with density @xmath126 on the model parameters , which encodes our prior beliefs prior to seeing the data .",
    "the likelihood and the prior are then combined using bayes theorem to derive the posterior distribution which essentially is the conditional distribution of the ( unknown ) parameter @xmath89 , given the data @xmath127 @xmath128    the posterior distribution contains all the information about the parameters given the observed data and therefore it is of high importance from a bayesian viewpoint .",
    "although in principle we are interested in deriving its probability density function explicitly , the calculation of the normalising constant in the denominator of often makes such a task difficult .",
    "traditionally , this has been a severe obstacle in bayesian computation , especially when @xmath89 is high - dimensional and the constant is analytically intractable .",
    "nevertheless , the last three decades have seen the development of several computational methods which enabled _ sampling - based _",
    "bayesian inference ; that is to be able to draw samples from @xmath129 without the need of calculating @xmath130 .",
    "for example , markov chain monte carlo @xcite methods provide such a tool to sample from the posterior distribution and obtain sample estimates quantities of interest ( e.g. densities , posterior moments etc . ) , thereby performing the integration implicitly .",
    "when the likelihood can be either difficult or costly to evaluate it is practically infeasible to use mcmc or even to perform maximum likelihood inference . however , provided it is possible to simulate from a model , then ` implicit ' methods such as approximate bayesian computation ( abc ) enable inference without having to calculate the likelihood .",
    "these methods were originally developed for applications in population genetics @xcite and human demographics @xcite , but are now being used in a wide range of fields including epidemiology , biology and finance , to name a few ; see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "intuitively , abc methods involve simulating data from the model using various parameter values and making inference based on which parameter values produced realisations that are ` close ' to the observed data .",
    "it is easy to show that algorithm below generates _ exact _ samples from the bayesian posterior density @xmath131 which is proportional to @xmath132 :    * 1 * : sample @xmath133 from @xmath134 .",

    "the output of the abc algorithm is a sample from the abc posterior density @xmath143 if @xmath141 is a sufficient statistic , then the abc posterior density converges to @xmath144 as @xmath145 @xcite .",
    "however , in practice it is often difficult to find an @xmath141 which is sufficient .",
    "hence abc requires a careful choice of @xmath141 and @xmath142 to make the acceptance rate tolerably large , at the same time as trying not to make the abc posterior too different from the true posterior @xmath146 .",
    "in section [ sec.abc.maser ] we will apply the abc procedure for estimating the rabi angle of the atom maser . for this",
    ", we will first discuss different choices of summary statistics and investigate to what extent they enable us to recover the _ true _",
    "posterior distribution .",
    "we will then show that applying abc with a combination of the statistics gives a posterior which is comparable with the performance of the mle on the full data .",
    "we now return to the atom maser and apply the general frequentist and bayesian methods described in the provious section to the problem of estimating the key dynamical parameter of the system , the rabi angle @xmath0 . in @xcite we have shown that the counts statistics @xmath147 can be used to estimate @xmath0 and we provided explicit expressions of the corresponding ( asymptotic ) fisher informations per unit of time . here",

    ", one can compute the likelihood function for a given measurement record and apply statistical techniques to investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the mle @xcite . although we are not in an i.i.d . setting , the process consisting of the measurement record _ together _ with the conditional cavity state",
    "is markovian and ergodic , and the asymptotic normality results described in section [ sec.frequentist ] apply to this set - up .",
    "in particular , the fisher information up to time @xmath37 increases linearly in time in the sense that @xmath148 and the mean square error of the mle scales as @xmath149 . for simplicity we will call @xmath150 the fisher information , but we should note that it is an asymptotic information per unit of time . as shown in @xcite",
    "the fisher information associated to the counting measurements in all four channels , achieves the upper bound given by the _ quantum _ fisher information contained in the joint quantum state of system ( cavity ) and output ( atoms and photon bath ) and is proportional to the stationary mean photon number : @xmath151 .",
    "this result will serve as a benchmark for assessing the power of other estimators constructed from the atoms detection process which _ is _ accessible in experiments .",
    "we switch now to the second scenario where the data consists solely of the atoms measurement record .",
    "since we average over photon emission and absorption events , the measurement process is _ not _ markovian , but falls in the class of hidden markov processes , where the observations ( atom detections ) are certain stochastic functionals of an unobserved markov process ( the cavity ) .",
    "below we analyse two likelihood - based sub - scenarios . in the first one @xcite , all time correlations in the detection record",
    "are ignored and we only consider the _ total number of counts _ of a certain type up to time @xmath37 , for which the fisher information can be computed explicitely . in the second sub - scenario",
    "we apply the maximum likelihood method to the full atom counts record , and estimate the corresponding fisher information .",
    "let @xmath152 be the two total number of counts up to time @xmath37 , as defined in section [ sec.simulations ] .",
    "by applying the markov property one can compute the characteristic function of @xmath153 and prove that the processes are ( jointly and locally ) asymptotically normal @xcite .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath154 then the properly rescaled count statistics converge to a gaussian distribution @xmath155 where both @xmath156 and @xmath157 have explicit expressions in terms of certain lindblad type generators on the cavity space . note that since @xmath0 is unknown , @xmath153 is not ` centred ' by subtracting its expectation @xmath158 as customary in the central limit theorem , but with the expectation at the fixed parameter @xmath159 .",
    "consequently , the gaussian limit has a non - zero mean which is proportional to the local parameter @xmath160 .    from the gaussian limit model",
    "we can easily obtain the fisher information for different combinations of the count statistics .",
    "in particular the fisher informations for the components @xmath161 and @xmath162 are @xmath163 and their dependence on @xmath159 is illustrated in figure [ fig : counts ] by the blue and red lines . by optimising over the linear combinations",
    "@xmath164 we obtain the maximum fisher information that can be extracted from the total counts statistics @xmath165 the graphs of the three fisher informations as functions of @xmath0 are shown in figure [ fig : counts ] .",
    "we note that all informations are equal to zero at a point @xmath1 where the means of @xmath166 are stationary with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "we now investigate the performance of the mle and the corresponding fisher information in the case where the full measurement record up to time @xmath37 is taken into account , rather that only the total counts . as outlined in section [ sec : detection ] , a detection record @xmath36 } : = \\ { ( t_1 , i_1 ) , \\dots , ( t_n , i_n)\\}$ ] consists of a sequence of detection times prior to time @xmath37 , together with labels indicating the outcome of each atom measurement . in simulations ,",

    "in this section we apply the abc procedure to the experimental data consisting of a set of detection events @xmath36 } : = \\ { ( t_1 , i_1 ) , \\dots , ( t_n , i_n)\\}$ ] , and different combinations from a total of 7 summary statistics .",
    "the statistics fall into four categories : i ) total number of ground and excited state atoms ; ii ) waiting time statistics for both ground and excited state atoms ; iii ) average number of the consecutive detections of the same type ; iv ) a statistic of the local density of detected ground state atoms in the vicinity of detected excited atoms . for a better physical intuition we will give a brief description of each statistic , but we emphasize that no knowledge of their theoretical properties is required in applying the abc estimation procedure .",
    "furthermore , we employ different distance metrics for each type of summary statistic . for the total numbers of atoms we use the euclidean distance , while for the average number of consecutive detections the distance is defined as the absolute value of the difference divided by the average number of consecutive detections in the experimental data . when using the local density and the waiting time statistics we essentially need a metric which measures the distance between two random samples .",
    "the kolmogorov  smirnov ( ks ) distance is often used to test whether two underlying one - dimensional probability distributions differ . therefore , we employed the statistic which is used for a kolmogorov  smirnov test as our distance metric and is defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath125 and @xmath179 be two random variables with distributions @xmath180 and @xmath181 respectively . denote their cumulative distribution functions ( cdf ) by @xmath182 and @xmath183 respectively .",

    "for a given set of experimental data corresponding to a value of the unknown parameter @xmath190 we perform a number @xmath191 simulations for trial parameters @xmath192 $ ] drawn with uniform probability . for each simulation we store the value of the parameter and the values of each of the 7 distances between the corresponding statistics of the simulated data and the statistics of the experimental data .",
    "let @xmath193 be the set of all the simulated parameters and let @xmath194 be the corresponding set of distances for statistic @xmath195 .",

    "let @xmath201 be the set of parameters corresponding to the distances contained in @xmath202 i.e. the values of the trial parameter which minimize the distance between the statistic @xmath203 of the trial data and the experimental data .",
    "finally , for statistic @xmath203 , the set of accepted parameters @xmath204 is used to build the corresponding posterior distribution .    in order to improve the resulting posterior distribution of the unknown parameter we also consider combinations of two or more statistics .",
    "this boils down to finding the parameters which minimise the distances corresponding to _ all _ the chosen statistics .",
    "for example , when two statistics @xmath203 and @xmath55 are considered together , the resulting posterior distribution is built from the set @xmath205 and is narrower than each individual posterior distribution .",
    "following this reasoning the best posterior distribution is obtained from the intersection of all @xmath206 sets @xmath204 and it is shown in figure  [ fig : alltogether ] .      we will call a waiting time , the time between two successive detections of atoms in the _ same _ ( ground or excited ) state . in the stationary regime ,",
    "the state of the cavity immediately after a jump of type @xmath207 is on average given by @xmath208 , where @xmath209 is the corresponding jump operator .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "being an average state , it should be equal to the state after another jump , when averaging over all waiting times . the probability density of the waiting time , with initial state @xmath210 is @xmath211 and the state after the jump is @xmath212 .",
    "therefore the average over time is @xmath213 by identifying @xmath210 and @xmath214 we obtain the solution @xmath215 defined above .",
    "the corresponding waiting time is @xmath216 let @xmath217 be the cumulative distribution function of @xmath218 , where we have made explicit the dependance on the unknown parameter @xmath0 .",
    "this dependence can be quantified by means of the kolmogorov - smirnov distance @xmath219 which is plotted in figure [ fig : kstheory ] as a function of @xmath0 , with @xmath220 and stationary initial state . in general when the ks distance is large , the parameter @xmath159 is easier to distinguish from @xmath0 and therefore the accuracy of the abc procedure is higher .",
    "a notable feature of figure [ fig : kstheory ] is the fact that the ks distance has two local minima , one for @xmath221 and a slightly larger one at a value for which the stationary cavity mean photon number is roughly the same as for @xmath159 .",
    "this behaviour is related to the vanishing of the classical fisher information for total atom counts statistics at @xmath222 as discussed in section [ sec.total.counts ] .",
    "we now apply abc for the summary statistics given by the empirical waiting time distribution , using the ks distance between such distributions as distance function .",
