    "in an earlier letter @xcite , we had studied the question of the screening mass in the @xmath1 dimensional abelian higgs model with a chern - simons term as well as in qed@xmath0 with a chern - simons term .",
    "we had shown there that , at one loop , the magnetic mass in qed@xmath0 vanishes .",
    "this is quite surprising considering the fact that the chern - simons term has associated with it various magnetic phenomena @xcite and yet the magnetic mass vanishes . in that letter @xcite",
    ", we had formally argued , based on ward identity as well as the assumption of analyticity of the amplitudes , that this result holds to all orders .",
    "however , as is well known , amplitudes cease to be analytic and infrared divergences , in general , become severe at finite temperature @xcite , both of which can invalidate a formal argument .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we study this question systematically in qed@xmath0 with a chern - simons term at finite temperature and give an alternate proof that the magnetic mass indeed vanishes to all orders .",
    "it has already been noted @xcite that , at two loops , the parity violating part of the gauge self - energy ( correction to the chern - simons term ) develops an infrared divergence at finite temperature in the absence of a tree level chern - simons term .",
    "it is for this reason that we study qed@xmath0 with a chern - simons term .",
    "however , as the one loop result shows @xcite , even with a tree level chern - simons term , the photon propagator develops a massless pole and , therefore , the question of infrared divergence has to be analyzed carefully .",
    "we note that the vanishing of the magnetic mass at finite temperature has already been studied in qed@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "however , infrared divergences become more severe as we go to lower dimensions . the two dimensional theory ( schwinger model )",
    "is known to be well behaved @xcite and , therefore , the @xmath1 dimensional theory is the most interesting theory to study from this point of view .",
    "our results are organized as follows . in section",
    "* ii * , we show that , at one loop , the magnetic mass vanishes in qed in any dimension at finite temperature .",
    "the additional feature of the @xmath1 dimensional theory is that even the zero temperature contribution to the magnetic mass can be regularized to zero .",
    "we also explicitly show that , at two loops , qed@xmath0 with a chern - simons term has vanishing contribution to the magnetic mass and that there is no infrared divergence present in this amplitude at this order even in the absence of a tree level chern - simons term . in section * iii * , we prove that the vanishing of the magnetic mass holds to all orders . in section",
    "* iv * , we present a brief summary of our results .",
    "let us consider qed@xmath0 with a chern - simons term described by the lagrangian density @xmath3 where @xmath4 is known as the chern - simons coefficient and the covariant derivative is defined to be @xmath5 in @xmath1 dimensions , the chern - simons term as well as the mass term for the fermion break discrete symmetries such as parity and time reversal @xcite and , therefore , are intimately connected .",
    "namely , even if there is no chern - simons term present at the tree level , it is generated through radiative corrections in a massive fermion theory @xcite .",
    "let us note , however , that both these terms are invariant under charge conjugation under which @xmath6 as a result , the lagrangian density in ( [ lagrangian ] ) is invariant under charge conjugation and it is the charge conjugation invariance which , for example , makes the amplitudes with an odd number of photons to vanish ( furry s theorem ) in this theory .",
    "we would like to study the question of the magnetic mass in this theory at finite temperature .    throughout this paper",
    ", we will use the imaginary time formalism @xcite to study the finite temperature effects in this theory .",
    "therefore , we will consider the theory in the euclidean space .",
    "in such a theory , the self - energy of the photon is independent of the gauge fixing parameter and , in a covariant gauge , can be parameterized to all orders as @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 with @xmath9 here @xmath10 represents the velocity of the heat bath which , in the rest frame , takes the form @xmath11 .",
    "there are several things to note here .",
    "first , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , lead respectively to the transverse and the longitudinal masses for the photon .",
    "while the longitudinal mass is responsible for the screening of charges , it is the transverse mass which is related to the magnetic mass of the photon .",
    "second , the presence of the parity odd term , in the self - energy , is a consequence of the fact that parity is violated in this theory . from the form of the tensors in ( [ tensors ] ) , it is easy to see that we can write , in general , the magnetic mass for the photon ( which is defined in the static limit ) as @xmath14 where @xmath15 represents the number of space - time dimensions .",
    "namely , the magnetic mass is determined completely from the parity conserving part of the self - energy and does not depend on the parity violating structure .",
    "we note that in the imaginary time formalism , the tree level fermion propagator has the form @xmath16 where , in the euclidean space , we work with @xmath17 and @xmath18    -4 cm    with these , we note that the photon self - energy in qed at one loop , in an arbitrary dimension , takes the form ( see fig .",
    "1 ) @xmath19 in @xmath15-dimensional euclidean space , the trace over the gamma matrices takes the form @xmath20}\\,\\delta_{\\mu\\nu } = - c(d)\\,\\delta_{\\mu\\nu}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 $ ] represents the floor of @xmath22 .",
    "evaluating the dirac trace and performing the sum over the discrete frequencies , we obtain , in the static limit @xmath23 where we have defined @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we can now identify the temperature dependent part of ( [ full ] ) to be @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the fermi - dirac distribution function .",
    "the expression on the right hand side of ( [ temp ] ) is easily seen to vanish , namely , @xmath28    this shows that , at finite temperature , the one loop correction to the magnetic mass vanishes in any dimension @xmath29 .",
    "we note that , at one loop , there is no infrared divergence since we are considering a massive fermion . in general",
    ", the zero temperature part in ( [ full ] ) has an ultraviolet divergence .",
    "however , in @xmath1 dimensions , there is the added interesting feature that the zero temperature part can be regularized to zero within the framework of pauli - villars regularization or dimensional regularization or a gauge invariant projection method @xcite .",
    "we also note that the one loop result is completely independent of the presence or absence of a tree level chern - simons term in @xmath1 dimensions and , therefore , holds even for pure qed@xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , let us note that while this has been an exact result at one loop , it can also be easily checked within the hard thermal loop approximation @xcite where @xmath30    -4 cm    we will show next that the magnetic mass also vanishes at two loops in qed@xmath0 with a chern - simons term .",
    "the two loop photon self - energy diagrams ( see fig .",
    "2 ) can be obtained from the one loop box diagrams by connecting the photon lines in all possible ways .",
    "we note that at tree level , the photon propagator , in a covariant gauge , has the form @xmath31 + \\xi\\,\\frac{p_{\\mu}p_{\\nu}}{(p^{2})^{2}}\\label{gaugepropagator}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the gauge fixing parameter and @xmath33 .",
    "furthermore , since the four photon amplitude at one loop ( sum of the box diagrams ) is gauge invariant , it vanishes when it is contracted with the momentum associated with a photon line .",
    "therefore , the only two terms from the photon propagator in ( [ gaugepropagator ] ) that can contribute to the two loop self - energy are the @xmath34 and the @xmath35 terms . with these simplifications in mind ,",
    "we obtain from the two loop photon self - energy , in the static limit , @xmath36 = 0\\ ] ] this result holds for both the zero temperature as well as the finite temperature parts and we note that this is true even when @xmath37 and , therefore , the vanishing of the magnetic mass , at two loops , holds even for pure qed@xmath0 .",
    "this has to be contrasted with the behavior of the parity violating part of the self - energy which has an infrared divergence when @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we see that unlike the parity violating part of the self - energy , the parity conserving part has a better infrared divergence behavior .",
    "it is worth pointing out here that this result can also be obtained in a simple manner using the ward identities of the theory .",
    "let us also note that the chern - simons term does have a nontrivial contribution to the parity conserving part of the self - energy , @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "however , surprisingly , it does not contribute to the magnetic mass ( [ definition ] ) .",
    "normally , an all orders proof of a result in a gauge theory is simplified enormously through the use of ward identities . however , at finite temperature , the non - analyticity of the amplitudes at the origin in the energy - momentum space leads to difficulties @xcite .",
    "for example , let us consider the @xmath40-point photon amplitude which would satisfy a relation of the form @xmath41 in the static limit where all the external energies vanish , on the other hand , we can write the amplitude as @xmath42 with @xmath43 where @xmath44 represents the number of time indices while @xmath45 corresponds to the number of space indices . in this case , the ward identity ( [ ward ] ) takes the form @xmath46 and one can formally argue that , for small @xmath47 , the amplitude behaves like @xcite @xmath48 this behavior is , in fact , explicitly seen at one loop in the two point and the four point functions for the photon in the static limit @xcite . in the long wave length limit where the spatial components of the momenta vanish , on the other hand , we have much more limited information .",
    "furthermore , even if we know the behavior of the amplitudes in the static and the long wave limits independently , this information is not very useful in constructing higher loop amplitudes , where the energy and momenta of the internal photon lines are integrated over all possible values .",
    "therefore , we pursue the following strategy in proving , to all orders , that the magnetic mass vanishes at finite temperature . first , let us look at the tree level propagator for the fermion in ( [ fermionpropagator ] ) and note that @xmath49 namely , we see that , much like at zero temperature @xcite , at finite temperature , differentiating the tree level fermion propagator is equivalent to introducing a tree level photon vertex with zero energy - momentum ( up to the coupling ) .",
    "this can also be rewritten in the more familiar form @xmath50 which says that , at the tree level , differentiating the fermion two point function gives rise to a vertex with zero energy and momentum , up to the coupling constant .",
    "-4 cm    let us next note that we can write the one loop @xmath40-point photon amplitude as @xmath51 where , as mentioned earlier , @xmath52 . using the relations in ( [ basicidentity1])-([basicidentity2 ] )",
    ", we see that the amplitude with an additional external photon with a space index and carrying zero energy and momentum is obtained to be ( see fig .",
    "3 ) @xmath53    this shows that an @xmath54 point amplitude with a photon line carrying a space index and zero energy - momentum vanishes for @xmath55 , independent of the values of the energy and momenta of the other photon lines .",
    "the restriction , @xmath56 , comes from the ultraviolet convergence of the integrand and , at one loop , we have no infrared divergence problem since the fermion is massive .",
    "we note that the odd point photon amplitudes vanish by charge conjugation invariance ( furry s theorem ) for any value of the external energy and momentum , but this result shows that even point photon amplitudes also vanish when one of the external photon lines has a space index and carries zero energy and momentum .",
    "it follows now , from this as well as charge conjugation invariance , that any fermion loop with an external photon carrying a space index and zero energy - momentum gives a vanishing contribution in a complicated diagram such as fig .",
    "4 , where the external photon is attached to an internal fermion line that is not a continuation of the external fermion lines .    -4 cm    as a result , using ( [ basicidentity1])-([basicidentity2 ] ) , it can be shown in a straightforward diagrammatic manner that , to all orders , we can write the three point photon - fermion - fermion vertex with the photon carrying a space index and zero energy - momentum as @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 represent respectively the vertex and the fermion self - energy to all orders .",
    "this is like the zero temperature ward identity @xcite , but holds for a space index , which is what we will need for our proof .",
    "-2 cm    -4 cm    with these , let us look at the photon self - energy to all orders given by the schwinger - dyson equation , fig .",
    "5 , which leads to @xmath60 the finite temperature part of this integrand is well behaved and , being a total divergence , vanishes , namely , @xmath61 to all orders .",
    "since the loop involves massive fermions , there is no problem of infrared divergence in this case .",
    "the temperature independent part of this expression has a linear divergence which , as we have mentioned in the last section , can be regularized to zero in @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "we note here that the vanishing of the finite temperature part to all orders appears naturally , in this description , to hold in any dimension .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that , at finite temperature , the magnetic mass vanishes at one loop in qed in any dimension . in @xmath1 dimensions ,",
    "in addition , the zero temperature part can be regularized to zero . in @xmath1 dimension , this result is independent of the presence of a tree level chern - simons term .",
    "we have calculated and shown explicitly that this result also holds at two loops .",
    "we have given a simple proof to show that the magnetic mass vanishes to all orders at finite temperature in this theory .",
    "this result also holds for qed in any dimension ."
