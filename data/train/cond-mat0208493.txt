    "coupled quantum dots exhibit a variety of quantum coherent phenomena @xcite that are expected to be crucial for controlling quantum superpositions and entanglement . in a semiconductor environment , these effects depend very sensitively on dephasing by environmental bosonic degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the importance of electron - phonon coupling for transport spectroscopy in double quantum dots is well - established by now @xcite , and suggestions have been made @xcite to explore ` semiconductor phonon cavity qed ' in nanostructures where phonons and thereby electron - phonon interactions become experimentally controllable .    in phonon cavities ,",
    "sample geometry becomes an important parameter since it determines boundary conditions for vibration modes , very often in a highly non - trivial way @xcite and different from standard semiconductor cavity qed @xcite .",
    "the control of mechanical properties , shape and boundary conditions opens the possibility to artificially tune the phonon spectrum of a sample .",
    "in particular , the interaction with phonons of a given energy can be suppressed which turns out to be important for certain realizations of quantum dot based qubits operations @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate two different ways of modifying the phonon modes of nanostructures based on ideas by kouwenhoven and van der wiel @xcite .",
    "we discuss the electronic current through two coupled quantum dots embedded into phonon cavities .",
    "double dots act as emitters of phonons @xcite and can be used as a measurement device for phonon modes @xcite , where the modifications in the phonon spectrum can be detected in the inelastic current .    in the first model , a double dot",
    "is placed between two arms of a surface acoustic wave ( saw ) inter - digitated transducer , the latter changing the electric boundary conditions for piezo - electric saws in an infinite half - space .",
    "we find that this system forms a resonator for surface waves leading to a gap in the phonon spectral density , which should be clearly observable in the current through a double quantum dot .",
    "our second model is an idealized version of a free - standing slab ( thin plate model ) , where some confined phonon modes evolve van hove singularities while others do not develop any electron - phonon interaction potential @xcite . in a non - perturbative calculation",
    ", we find that a van hove singularity leads to additional side peaks in the current .",
    "an important prediction of both models is the possibility to completely suppress phonon induced dephasing at phonon frequencies corresponding to certain ( tunable ) energy differences between the dots .",
    "we consider the surface of a semiconductor heterostructure on which thin metallic stripes are attached with a constant spacing @xmath0 between each other . in an ideal case both",
    "the number of stripes and their length is assumed to be infinite .",
    "similar structures are used to generate surface waves by applying an oscillating voltage at resonance frequency between adjacent stripes . in this work ,",
    "no voltage between the stripes is taken into account .",
    "two coupled quantum dots are located a small distance @xmath1 beneath the surface at the interface of the heterostructure .",
    "leads are attached to the quantum dots in order to enable transport experiments . in principle , all kinds of geometries are feasible as the positions of the quantum dots as well as the directions of the crystal axes relative to the stripes can be chosen at will .",
    "however , we restrict our calculation to one certain geometry where the dots are located symmetrically on both sides of one stripe exactly in the middle between two stripes as depicted in fig .",
    "[ sample ] .",
    "the angle between the stripes and the crystal axes is chosen to be 45 degrees .",
    "the generalization to most other geometries follows directly from that case .",
    "surface acoustic waves propagate along the surface of a medium while their typical penetration depth into the medium is of the order of one wavelength .",
    "the prediction of their existence dates back to the nineteenth century and nowadays saw are used in a wide range of experiments @xcite . in piezoelectric media like gaas the displacement field of",
    "the wave generates an electric potential that dominates the interaction with electrons .",
    "interaction via the deformation potential is also present but some orders of magnitude smaller and is neglected in the following . as the piezoelectric potential of the wave has to meet the electric boundary conditions at the interface between the medium and the air , the electron - phonon interaction strongly depends on the electric properties of the surface .    in our model any mechanical influence of the metallic stripes on the elastic properties of the medium",
    "is neglected .",
    "instead , we expect an additional boundary condition due to the metallic stripes , as they are all connected to each other and form an equipotential line on the surface , @xmath2 the @xmath3 and @xmath4 coordinates are chosen such that the stripes are parallel to the @xmath4-axis and located at positions @xmath5 while the width of the stripes is neglected .",
    "we assume that all surface modes , whose piezoelectric potential does not fulfill the boundary condition ( [ condition ] ) are suppressed and consequently need not to be considered any further .",
    "thus , the remaining task is to find all surface waves compatible with ( [ condition ] ) .    without additional boundary conditions as ( [ condition ] )",
    ", surface waves propagate as plane waves with wave vector @xmath6 along the surface . as the wave equation for the displacement field",
    "is linear , any linear combination of plane surface waves again gives a solution of the wave equation .",
    "hence , we consider the antisymmetric combination @xmath7 of surface plane waves with wave vectors @xmath8 and @xmath9 whose displacement field is given by @xmath10 in an isotropic model of the crystal , the functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 describe the decay of the saw amplitude in the depth @xmath13 of the medium and @xmath14 is the angle between the @xmath3-axis and the wave vector @xmath15 .",
    "this combination corresponds to a standing wave in @xmath3-direction and a plane wave in @xmath4-direction . for the piezoelectric potential created by this mode we find @xmath16 with @xmath17 the piezoelectric stress constant , @xmath18 the dielectric constant , @xmath19 the relative permitivity of the medium .",
    "the function @xmath20 describes the decay in @xmath13-direction @xcite and follows from the boundary condition for the electric field on the surface . here",
    ", we assume a free surface , i.e. a non - conducting surface , apart from condition ( [ condition ] ) . due to the special form of the mode @xmath7 as a standing wave in @xmath3-direction , the corresponding piezoelectric potential ( [ piezo ] ) vanishes at the lines @xmath21 .",
    "thus , the additional boundary condition ( [ condition ] ) is met by the modes @xmath7 if and only if @xmath22 apart from the plane surface waves with @xmath23 and @xmath24 , no other modes are compatible with condition ( [ condition ] ) .      we consider interactions between electrons and surface waves due to the piezoelectric potential ( [ piezo ] ) . for the calculation of the inelastic current between two quantum dots , it is necessary to find the quantized form of the surface modes @xmath7 and the corresponding piezoelectric potential .",
    "this can be achieved by calculating the lagrange function for these modes in a quantization volume of area @xmath25 and infinite depth .",
    "displacement and momentum can be replaced by operators obeying the canonical commutation relations .",
    "finally the hamiltonian of the surface waves can be written as a sum of harmonic oscillators , i.e. surface phonons .",
    "this specifies the normalization constant @xmath26 in ( [ displacement ] ) and ( [ piezo ] ) as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the density of the medium , @xmath29 a material parameter and @xmath30 the velocity of the saw .",
    "note , that @xmath26 does not depend on the wave vector @xmath15 but on the quantization area @xmath31 .",
    "thus , the electron - phonon interaction hamiltonian writes @xmath32 the boson operator @xmath33 creates a surface phonon with the displacement field @xmath34 as given in ( [ displacement ] ) .",
    "the interaction coefficient @xmath35 is defined as @xmath36      we calculate an approximation for the inelastic current through a double quantum dot for the geometry described above , when only interactions with phonons @xmath7 ( [ displacement ] ) with ( [ qx ] ) are considered .",
    "a source - drain voltage between the leads on both sides of the double quantum dot gives a current through the double quantum dot , as electrons tunnel step by step from one lead to one dot , then to the other dot and finally to the other lead . in the coulomb blockade regime , only one additional electron is on either of the dots at the same time .",
    "if , however , a bias voltage is applied between the two quantum dots , the mismatch of the energy levels of the additional electron in the two dots results in a suppression of the current due to energy conservation . in that case , only inelastic processes like emission or absorption of phonons allow a finite current @xcite . at zero temperature",
    "this inelastic current can be approximated by @xmath37 where @xmath19 is the energy difference of the additional electron between the two quantum dots @xcite .",
    "the tunneling rate between the dots is given by @xmath38 and the effective spectral density is defined as @xmath39 here , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the matrix elements of the interaction operator ( [ int ] ) with the electron wave function in the left or the right quantum dot , respectively .",
    "the size of the quantum dot is assumed to be negligible against the phonon wavelength and hence the electron density is approximated by a @xmath42 function at the center of the corresponding quantum dot .",
    "taking into account only wave numbers with @xmath43 as given in ( [ qx ] ) we find @xmath44   0 & m \\mbox { even } \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] the modes with even @xmath45 do not contribute to the current because the corresponding piezoelectric potential has zeros at the positions of the quantum dots and therefore these modes do not interact with the dots .    in the thermodynamic limit of a macroscopic sample ,",
    "the @xmath4-component of the saw wavenumber becomes quasi continuous and the sum over @xmath46 can be replaced by an integral .",
    "thereby the system - length @xmath47 cancels and the effective spectral density writes @xmath48 the same procedure does not apply for the sum over @xmath43 since these modes do not depend on the system - length @xmath47 but obey condition ( [ qx ] ) . hence , the inelastic current through the double quantum dots still depends on the system - length @xmath47 and will vanish in the thermodynamic limit of @xmath49 .",
    "the reason is that the energy @xmath50 of one phonon is distributed over the whole sample . by increasing the system - size @xmath47 ,",
    "the amplitude of the displacement and the piezoelectric potential , and therewith the interaction strength is decreased and finally vanishes .",
    "normally , this effect is canceled by an increasing number of modes within each interval of energy . here , however , the modes are independent of the system - size due to the additional boundary condition made by the stripes .",
    "thus , the inelastic current through the double quantum dots due to emission of surface waves is completely suppressed by the metallic stripes in the ideal case .    in a real sample with disorder and impurities ,",
    "the phonon is not extended over the whole sample size but concentrated on a finite area , leading to a non - vanishing inelastic current .",
    "moreover , the suppression of phonon modes with wavenumber @xmath43 close to condition ( [ qx ] ) is not perfect .",
    "these modes are damped but still interact with the quantum dots and hence ensure a finite inelastic current .",
    "the width of the interval @xmath51 around @xmath52 in which the suppression of phonon modes is not complete depends on the quality of the saw cavity formed by the stripes on top of the sample .",
    "we include both effects in a finite system - length @xmath47 and find @xmath53 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where the system - length is given in units of the spacing of the stripes , @xmath54 and a typical frequency for the system is introduced , @xmath55 .",
    "this approximation for the inelastic current is shown for typical experimental values in fig .",
    "[ step ] .",
    "summarizing one can say that the metallic stripes on top of the sample form a cavity for surface acoustic waves since the additional boundary condition require a standing wave in one direction . as a consequence ,",
    "the inelastic current caused by emission of surface waves differs extremely from the case without stripes @xcite . in the ideal case ,",
    "the inelastic current is completely suppressed . however , taking into account a non - perfect cavity due to a finite length , a finite width , and a finite number of stripes we find a non - vanishing inelastic current as given in eq .",
    "( [ current ] ) .    for energies smaller than @xmath56 the lowest standing wave mode can not be excited and consequently the inelastic current exhibits a gap in that energy region .",
    "the excitation of higher modes manifests itself in a step in the inelastic current , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ step ] for @xmath57 .",
    "furthermore , at @xmath58 the inelastic current vanishes , because the saw would be emitted along the crystal axes in this case , but there is no piezoelectric interaction in that direction . it seems promising to investigate the influence of a saw cavity also for other geometries . if the quantum dots are realized right beneath the metallic stripes , the inelastic current will be further suppressed .",
    "moreover , the angle between the stripes and the dots or between the stripes and the crystal axes can be changed .",
    "another possibility to change the phonon spectrum of a sample is to use geometrical confinement and thereby changing the mechanical boundary conditions of the system .",
    "recently , considerable progress has been made in the fabrication of nano - structures ( ` phonon cavities ' ) that are only partly suspended or even free - standing @xcite .",
    "they considerably differ in their mechanical properties from the bulk material .",
    "for example , phonon modes are split into several subbands , and quantization effects become important for the thermal conductivity @xcite .",
    "moreover , we have recently predicted that phonon subband quantization can also be detected in the non - linear electron current through double quantum dots embedded into nano - size semiconductor slabs acting as phonon cavities @xcite .",
    "like in the previous section , the phonons act as a source of dissipation for the electrons by spontaneous emission even at zero temperature .",
    "these inelastic processes lead to fingerprints of the phonon density of states in the electron current ( see eqs .  ( [ i_inel ] ) and ( [ rho ] ) ) showing quantitatively the possibility to use double quantum dots as phonon detectors @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "double dots can be used as tunable energy selective phonon emitter @xcite with well defined emission characteristics because the transport is mediated by spontaneous emission .",
    "this fact together with some peculiar properties of phonons confined to nanosize planar cavities open the path to new and interesting effects .",
    "for instance , at a certain energy @xmath59 the cavity phonon corresponding to the frequency @xmath60 evolves a displacement field @xmath61 of the cavity that does not induce any interaction potential ( piezoelectric _ or _",
    "deformation potential ) acting on the electrons @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a _ complete decoupling _ of dot electrons and cavity phonons leading to the possibility to suppress phonon induced dephasing in double quantum dot qubits .",
    "a further peculiarity of cavity phonons is that certain subbands lead to the existence of van hove singularities in the density of states .",
    "these correspond to minima in the dispersion at finite wavevectors with preceeding negative phonon group velocity , see fig .",
    "[ fig - dos ] .",
    "a van hove singularity leads to strong inelastic transitions in the double quantum dot corresponding to a large emission rate of phonons of energy @xmath62 .    in the following",
    "we investigate the influence of such van hove singularities on the electron transport through coupled quantum dots in a non - perturbative way .",
    "led by previous numerical results @xcite we decompose the phonon spectral density ( [ rho ] ) to find an analytical model @xmath63 consisting of a van hove singularity at energy @xmath62 and a background of lower order subbands that form an ohmic bath .",
    "we follow previous calculations @xcite using a combination of a master equation approach and a unitary transformation . neglecting the ohmic bath ,",
    "the stationary inelastic current at zero temperature can be written as @xmath64 thus , besides the main peak at @xmath62 , the van hove singularity leads to non - perturbative satellite peaks at harmonics of the frequency @xmath65 with oscillator strength @xmath66 similar to double dot systems under monochromatic microwave irradiation @xcite .",
    "the influence of the ohmic bath background manifests in a power law divergence @xcite instead of the former deltalike singularities at energies @xmath67 .",
    "designing the geometry of nanostructures allows to create phonon cavities with tailored phonon spectra and electron - phonon interaction .",
    "the latter can be completely suppressed at certain energies ( or even energy windows ) which is expected to be crucial for the realization of semiconductor quantum dot based quantum information processing .",
    "we have shown that emission of surface acoustic phonons can be completely suppressed in coupled quantum dots embedded between an infinite inter - digitated transducer . moreover , in a free - standing slab , double quantum dots can be brought into resonance with zeros of the phonon spectral density ( leading to a vanishing dephasing in lowest order ) , or with van hove singularities of the phonon spectrum which lead to additional side peaks in the inelastic current .",
