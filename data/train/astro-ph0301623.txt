    "the study of perturbations in the universe plays a central role in modern cosmology . not only do these perturbations create the opportunity for objects like galaxies and clusters to form , but they also record a history of the early phases of the universe . by studying the detailed statistics of the perturbations imprinted on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) or on the galaxy distribution , we can learn about the time scales and matter content of the universe and perhaps even about very early physics , such as the nature of inflation .",
    "over thirty years of galaxy surveys have produced an ever - improving map of the density structure of the universe . with the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ;",
    "york et al .",
    "2000 ) and 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; colless et al .",
    "2001 ) , we will have over a million galaxy redshifts tracing the density in the local universe .",
    "these surveys will measure the clustering of galaxies on huge scales and will allow detailed comparison of the clustering properties of different subclasses of galaxies on intermediate and small scales .",
    "current surveys at higher redshift , for example , the cnoc ii ( yee et al .",
    "2000 ) , deep ( http://deep.ucolick.org/ ) , and virmos ( http://www.astrsp-mrs.fr/virmos/vvds.htm ) surveys , plan to acquire around 100,000 redshifts of galaxies from much earlier epochs .",
    "this will allow us to measure the evolution of galaxy properties , including their clustering , over cosmic time .",
    "large redshift surveys have been among the heaviest users of our wide - field multi - object spectroscopic capabilities . as the current generation of surveys moves towards completion , it is very timely ( indeed , past due ) to begin planning for the next .",
    "there are several different options , not all of which involve large amounts of spectroscopy . in my contribution , i discuss some of the options and offer a sketch of one possibility , a large redshift survey at @xmath1 .",
    "in planning for the future , we must begin with what we hope to learn from surveys of large - scale structure .",
    "this discussion breaks into two sets of topics .",
    "first , large - scale structure depends upon , and therefore can inform , fundamental cosmology .",
    "the current state of perturbations in the universe is a product of both the initial seeding of the fluctuations and their evolution throughout cosmic history .",
    "these two ingredients are usually separable , especially when combined with cmb anisotropy measurements .",
    "the spatial dependences of clustering statistics can measure the abundances and properties of cosmic matter , e.g. , the baryon fraction , neutrino mass , and the coldness of the dark matter , as well as the spectrum of the initial fluctuations , e.g. , the spectral tilt or perhaps any intrinsic scales .",
    "the time evolution of clustering statistics further depends on cosmological parameters , e.g. the matter density of the universe or the properties of dark energy .",
    "large - scale structure can also be sensitive to non - gaussianity in the initial seeding of perturbations .",
    "finally , measurements of peculiar velocities and redshift distortions test the role of gravity in driving the evolution of the cosmic perturbations .",
    "second , with regard to galaxy surveys , one is probing the properties of galaxy clustering bias . while this is often seen as a nuisance in the context of large - scale structure , measurements of clustering bias",
    "are an opportunity to place constraints on the theory of galaxy formation . with large surveys , we are moving beyond the idea of bias as a single number to investigate the dependences of bias on spatial scale , time , and intrinsic properties of the galaxies .",
    "these dependences should encode the relation of galaxies both to mass and to other galaxies .",
    "clustering bias should be a precision test of galaxy formation theory .",
    "however , it is not clear that current theory can utilize the precision of even the current generations of surveys , and so i will focus my discussion strictly on cosmological inferences from large - scale structure .",
    "it is important to recognize the value of the `` linear regime '' , i.e.  the smallness of fluctuations on large scales . in the theory of gravitational instability ,",
    "small fluctuations evolve in simple ways , namely that the evolution of each fourier mode depends on its wavelength and on the homogeneous properties of the universe but remains independent from all other perturbative modes .",
    "this means that linear - regime perturbations retain full memory of their history .",
    "perturbations on smaller scales , in which the rms fractional density fluctuation is order unity or larger , grow in a non - linear fashion in which all modes become coupled to one another .",
    "this erases many imprints of the early universe ( e.g. , meiksin et al .",
    "hence , searches for preferred scales or subtle non - gaussian signatures in the early universe are generally only possible on large , linear scales .",
    "some of the cosmological signatures available in linear - regime clustering include :    * features in the initial power spectrum .",
    "the initial spectrum is usually assumed to be a power - law in wavenumber , as is common in inflationary models . however , there are models that predict more complicated spectra , and there has been persistent albeit controversial observational evidence for a peak in the power spectrum on scales of @xmath2 ( e.g. , broadhurst et al . 1990 ) .",
    "* baryon acoustic oscillations .",
    "prior to @xmath3 , the coupling of the photons and electrons in the ionized universe causes perturbations to act as sound waves ( peebles & yu 1970 ) .",
    "the rapid loss of pressure support at recombination captures a snapshot of these oscillations .",
    "the result is harmonic signatures in the cmb and matter power spectra .",
    "the effect is smaller in the matter spectrum because the baryons are subdominant to the cold dark matter , which does not participate in the acoustic motion .",
    "* neutrino masses .",
    "massive neutrinos suppress clustering on small scales relative to large scales because they move too quickly to be trapped in small fluctuations ( bond & szalay 1983 ) .",
    "* initial non - gaussianity .",
    "most inflation models produce gaussian initial conditions for the density perturbations , but there are exceptions .",
    "if primordial non - gaussianity exists , then the linear regime carries even more information and would be an important new window onto the process that initiates structure formation .",
    "fortunately , clustering bias may also be simple in the linear regime .",
    "models in which galaxy formation is a local ( i.e. , sub - mpc ) process predict a scale - independent bias on large scales ( coles 1993 ) .",
    "this is especially secure when seeking preferred scales , e.g. the baryon acoustic oscillations , as it is implausible that galaxy formation would involve action on such enormous and specific scales .    in the present - day universe",
    ", the linear regime conservatively would be defined as wavelengths above @xmath4 or wavenumbers @xmath5 .",
    "sharp spatial features , such as the baryon acoustic oscillations , are erased on smaller scales ( meiksin et al .",
    "1999 ) . at higher redshift ,",
    "clustering is less advanced and so the linear regime extends to smaller comoving scales .",
    "however , because @xmath6 , the non - linear scale recedes only slowly at low redshifts . at @xmath7 ,",
    "the non - linear scale is at best a factor of two smaller ( @xmath8 ) . at redshifts above 1 ,",
    "the non - linear scale begins to recede quickly , both because of the faster evolution and because of the shape of the cdm power spectrum on small scales . at @xmath9 ,",
    "the non - linear scale is roughly 5 times smaller than present ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "measuring clustering in the linear regime requires enormous survey volumes with moderate , but not superb , sampling densities . the 2dfgrs survey will provide about a survey volume of about @xmath11 .",
    "the sdss main galaxy survey is currently of similar size and will eventually triple this volume . the sdss luminous , red galaxy ( lrg ; eisenstein et al .",
    "2001 ) sample will probe a yet larger volume , about @xmath12 .    current surveys at @xmath7 probe considerably less volume than this , which means that they do not compete well in measuring linear regime clustering .",
    "these surveys are of course wonderful for studying galaxy evolution , including the change in clustering on intermediate scales . surveys of quasars have too small a number density to sample the density field properly .",
    "it is worth noting that increasing the volume of a `` local '' sample by a factor of 10 over sdss lrg would require a @xmath13 steradian survey to @xmath14 with at least a million galaxies .",
    "volume alone drives us to high redshift !",
    "weak lensing surveys are quickly maturing ( see wittman 2002 for a review ) .",
    "this method carries great promise because it avoids the problems of galaxy bias .",
    "the ability to measure mass fluctuations directly will be a great advance on both linear and non - linear scales . in particular , weak lensing studies will measure the amplitude , tilt , and smoothed shape of the matter power spectrum to excellent precision ( e.g. , hu & tegmark 1999 ) . note that this applies to both @xmath15 clustering , using galaxies as the sources , and @xmath1 clustering , using the cmb as the source , although the latter is limited to @xmath16 even for optimistic future experiments ( hu 2001 , hu & okamoto 2002 ) .",
    "it will be difficult for galaxy clustering surveys to compete on these topics , because the amplitudes and broad tilts are exactly the items with which clustering bias interferes .",
    "nevertheless , weak lensing in cosmological contexts does have some weaknesses .",
    "in particular , because sources are lensed by all mass along the line of sight , weak lensing suffers heavily from projection effects .",
    "this is crippling for the study of sharp features in the power spectrum and initial non - gaussianity . separating the lensing signal by source redshift",
    "provides a small amount of resolution along the line of sight but not enough for these topics ( hu 1999 ) .",
    "the primary anisotropies of the cmb ( those produced at @xmath3 ) are also the product of the linear regime .",
    "the planck mission ( http://astro.estec.esa.nl/sa-general/projects/planck/ ) should be able to measure the primary signal to @xmath17 , which is @xmath18 .",
    "converting the available precision to the requirements on a galaxy redshift survey produces an equivalent survey volume of @xmath19 !",
    "this is of course superb .",
    "however , on smaller scales , the primary anisotropies of the cmb will be very difficult to measure .",
    "i have argued that linear - regime clustering is a path to fundamental cosmology . how do we improve the coverage described in the last section ?",
    "the scale of survey required to improve the current situation at @xmath20 , much less to compete with the cmb , suggests that we consider how to access the linear regime at @xmath21 . for this",
    ", we must work at higher redshift , and the next convenient window for optical spectroscopy is @xmath9 using the lyman break selection technique ( steidel et al .",
    "let us therefore consider a large survey at @xmath1 .    as a primary purpose of such",
    "a survey is to search for preferred scales , i.e. , sharp features in the power spectrum , it would be best to design a survey that can certainly detect the one such feature that we strongly expect to exist , namely the baryon acoustic oscillations .",
    "the first oscillation appears at @xmath20 and should be accessible in current low - redshift surveys ( percival et al .",
    "2001 claims a 2-@xmath22 hint of the oscillations ) .",
    "the second oscillation is still available at @xmath15 , but the current mid - redshift surveys are probably too small for the expected amplitude .",
    "a survey at @xmath0 could recover the entire sequence , limited only by the sharply declining amplitude of the higher harmonics .",
    "detecting the third and fourth acoustic peaks would require a survey at @xmath1 of roughly @xmath23 at the optimal number density of tracers .",
    "the latter is set by the inverse of the power spectrum on the desired scale ( kaiser 1986 ) .",
    "for lyman break galaxies , which are known to have @xmath24 ( steidel et al .",
    "1998 ) , the desired sampling is roughly @xmath25 , which is ( coincidentally and fortunately ) roughly the available number of targets accessible to few - hour exposure times on 8-meter class telescopes .",
    "the total number of galaxies in the survey would be half a million , and they would be distributed over about 150 square degrees with a sampling a 1 galaxy per square arcminute .    the statistical precision on the power spectrum available to such a survey is shown in figure [ bumps ] , following the approximations of tegmark ( 1997 ) .",
    "the survey would yield 1% measurements of bandpowers narrow enough to sample the acoustic peaks .",
    "it would detect 3 or 4 of the peaks , depending on cosmology , with a marginal detection of one additional peak in each case .",
    "what value does the detection of acoustic peaks have , given that we ( likely ) have detected them in the cmb power spectrum ?",
    "the key idea is that the scale of these oscillations defines a standard ruler . at low redshift , this allows us to split the angular diameter distance degeneracy of the cmb , thereby measuring the hubble constant ( eisenstein et al .",
    "1999 ) . at higher redshift",
    ", we actually get to measure this distance twice , once along the line of sight and once transverse to the line of sight .",
    "this cosmological distortion is familiar to those using the alcock - paczynski ( 1979 ) test , but here we need not rely on the ratio of the distances , as the distance itself is known from the shape of the acoustic peaks in the cmb .",
    "hence , one is able to constrain both the angular diameter distance to @xmath0 and the hubble constant at @xmath0 .",
    "clearly , this will put leverage on dark energy . in the limit that the dark energy is a cosmological constant , then the hubble constant at @xmath0",
    "is very nearly @xmath26 .",
    "this measurement of @xmath27 would allow a consistency check with the cmb , the failure of which could be resolved by permitting extra relativistic species at @xmath28 .",
    "the exact value of such a measurement in the context of joint parameter estimation with cmb , supernovae distance - redshift relations , weak lensing experiments , and other probes of classical cosmology remains to be calculated .",
    "lest one become too focused on baryon oscillations , it should be stressed that the fine structure of the linear regime on the scales @xmath29 is terra incognita to any current or planned survey , yet this is exactly the regime that controls the formation of large galaxies .",
    "the level of precision indicated in figure [ bumps ] would open a new discovery space for effects in the initial power spectrum and its subsequent evolution .",
    "an alternative to a large redshift survey at @xmath0 would be an even larger imaging survey using photometric redshifts to create the angular correlations of lyman - break galaxies .",
    "a proposal similar to this , but at lower redshift , has been made by cooray et al .",
    "such a survey would access the linear regime in a similar fashion to the discussion in the previous section .",
    "it is worth noting some of the disadvantages of this approach .",
    "first , the imaging survey would have to be considerably larger to match the precision , several thousand square degrees instead of 150 .",
    "second , the projection would significantly reduce leverage on non - gaussianity and slightly reduce sensitivity to narrow features , such as the higher acoustic oscillations .",
    "third , one loses the ability to measure the line - of - sight distance of the acoustic peak and other alcock - paczynski effects .",
    "finally , such a survey offers less control over systematic errors .",
    "all the modes in a single - band imaging survey would be strictly angular , meaning that they are degenerate with angular errors in the map ( e.g. , photometry offsets ) .",
    "a spectroscopic survey can remove such errors by using modes that are mixed between radial and tangential directions ( tegmark et al . 1998 ) . with photometric redshifts",
    ", an imaging survey does have some redundancy , namely that different slabs should be uncorrelated , but this is partially compromised by the scatter in photometric redshifts and by the need to control systematic errors in multiple bands of imaging .",
    "given that we seek precision measurements , the redundancy of the spectroscopic survey is a notable advantage .",
    "i have described some of the landscape in the design of the next generation of large - scale structure surveys .",
    "the linear regime remains a very powerful window into cosmic history .",
    "recognizing this value , the most persuasive extension beyond current surveys is to seek smaller scales rather than additional precision on large scales .",
    "this can be done only by observing the universe at higher redshift .",
    "@xmath9 is the next plausible window .",
    "a large survey of around half a million @xmath9 galaxies over 150 square degrees would probe the linear - regime power spectrum to scales twice as small as the cmb primary anisotropies with percent level precision .",
    "this is sufficient to detect four acoustic oscillations , which in turn can be used to measure the hubble constant and angular diameter distance to @xmath0 .",
    "we must quantify in detail how such a survey would compare to and complement other possible cosmological measurements .",
    "a survey of this size and scope is challenging but not impossible .",
    "it is probably too large for current wide - field spectrographs , but one can certainly imagine next - generation instruments that could perform the observations in reasonable time . if the science case can be shown to be quantitatively compelling , then such a survey would be a feasible next step in cosmology ."
