    "there are several longstanding problems in phenomenology and cosmology .",
    "one of them is why gravity is so weak in comparison with the electroweak interactions ( in other words why planck scale @xmath0 is much larger than that of electroweak interaction @xmath1 ) and is known as the _ hierarchy problem_. another important problem is why the energy density of dark energy which dominates the present universe ( assuming that its origin is vacuum energy of quantum fields ) @xmath2 is much smaller than that of gravitational scale @xmath3 , which is naturally expected from the standard model and is known as the _ cosmological constant problem_.    in this article , we focus on the casimir effect in a 6d braneworld model whose extra - dimensions are compactified by magnetic flux @xcite .",
    "6d flux compactification models have attracted much attensions because of the fascinating feature that they may help resolve the above puzzles , namely the hierarchy problem @xcite and the cosmological constant problem @xcite .",
    "it is also expected that in these models effects of extra - dimensions may be detected in future experiments on gravity because they may become important at sub - milimeter scales @xcite , where newton s law has not been strictly confirmed .    the basic motivation to consider the casimir effect in such a 6d brane model is as follows .",
    "an important point is that @xmath4 and @xmath5 have satisfy @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "thus in these two hierarchies there is substantial similarity and it could be naturally expected that if there is a theory which gives a common factor of @xmath8 , both hierarchy problems may be solved at the same time .",
    "the casimir effect in 6d spacetime may be able to give such a common factor .",
    "let s imagine a spacetime with @xmath9 extra dimensions ( later we set @xmath10 ) whose size is assumed to be stabilized at a characteristic scale @xmath11 .",
    "then , the dimensionaly reduced planck mass is given by @xmath12 @xcite , where we assume @xmath13 .",
    "casimir energy density induced on the brane by fields living in the internal space is roughly given by @xmath14 .",
    "thus , we get @xmath15 especially , for the case of @xmath10 , we obtain @xmath16 .",
    "if the casimir energy density @xmath17 plays the role of the dark energy density @xmath18 , we can get the desired ratio ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the problem is whether the ratio is really obtained from the setup of the 6d braneworld .",
    "bearing the above considerations in mind , in this article , we focus on the casimir effect in a specific model of 6d braneworld with a warped flux compactification .",
    "we analyze the casimir effect induced by a massless minimally coupled scalar field in a warped flux compactification model based on a 6d ( salam - sezgin ) supergravity @xcite , employing zeta function regularization techniques . in the 4d effective theory of the model",
    ", a volume modulus arises due to the scale invariance of the 6d theory and is stabilized by one - loop quantum corrections to the effective potential induced by the bulk scalar field .",
    "we then discuss implications for the hierarchy and cosmological constant problems . in ref .",
    "@xcite the casimir effect in a 4d toy model , which has a very similar spacetime structure to this 6d model , has been discussed . as a consequence , it has been suggested that for larger degrees of warping and smaller degree of dilaton coupling , the casimir effect may give a resolution to the hierarchy and cosmological constant problems .",
    "so , it is desirable to discuss the casimir effect in the original 6d model . in attempting to evaluate the casimir effect in the original 6d model , however , there is a technical problem arising from a lack of mathematical formulation of conical heat kernel coefficients ( in 6d ) , which are relevant to contributions of the boundary 3-branes to the effective potential .    to overcome the above technical problem ,",
    "we instead focus on a special relation between the relevant heat kernel coefficient and the analytically continued zeta function @xcite .",
    "the mass spectrum which includes brane contributions is now available in a conformally related ( unwarped ) spacetime and is very similar to the case of the 4d model .",
    "thus , instead of trying to evaluate the relevant heat kernel coefficient , we shall use the analytically continued zeta function by employing the mode sum technique , which has been developed in the recent work on the 4d toy model , ref .",

    "note , however , that there is also magnetic flux constraint given by @xmath40 and the magnetic flux only depends on @xmath35 and @xmath37 and does not on @xmath39 .",
    "thus the size of the bulk is not fixed by flux conservation . to discuss the modulus dynamics ,",
    "we take the moduli approximation , namely assuming that @xmath41 . integrating over the extra dimensions , we obtain @xmath42 after redefining the modulus as @xmath43 we obtain the canonical form of the modulus kinetic term as @xmath44",

    "was first proposed in the large extra dimension model given in ref .",
    "the basic idea is that we assume that the fundamental gravitational scale is not @xmath4 itself but the higher - dimensional one ( @xmath81 in 6d braneworld ) and @xmath82 .",
    "then , the observed planck scale is effectively given as a result of a dimensional reduction and in the present model @xmath83 to get the observed value of reduced planck scale , the size of extra dimension should be @xmath84 .",
    "thus now we ask whether volume stabilization at this scale is available in the present model .",

    "( [ sta - san ] ) . as is explained above , once the size of the internal space @xmath94",
    "is stabilized at @xmath95 , then @xmath96 has a value as @xmath97 and our main task is to explore such a possibility in the parameter space @xmath98 .",
    "another important problem is the cosmological constant problem , namely why the energy density of the present dark energy , assuming that its origin is vacuum energy of quantum fields , @xmath2 is much smaller than @xmath3 , expected from the standard model .",
    "a characteristic property of 6d braneworld is that the tree level vacuum energy of the brane , i.e. , brane tension , only changes the bulk deficit angle and does not affect the brane geometry @xcite .",
    "note that there are several criticisms for such a self - tuning mechanism mainly because flux conservation / quantization may induce a hidden fine - tuning of brane tension @xcite . here",
    "we focus on how important the casimir effect is at one - loop order of the vacuum energy , assuming that a self - tuning exists .",
    "of course , to build more realistic models with such a self - tuing mechanism is an important subject , but is out of scope of this article .",
    "after volume stabilization , from eqs .",
    "( [ originaleffpot ] ) and ( [ sta - san ] ) , the effective potential ( casimir energy density ) takes the value @xmath99 and hence , the realized brane vacuum energy is almost completely determined by the renormalization .",
    "the renormalization scale @xmath100 is also a free parameter but in order for an additional hierarchy problem not to appear it should be set to a value such as @xmath101 .",

    "if only normalizability were imposed this would allow for logarithmic divergences at the poles and this may well lead to additional modes in the eigenvalue spectrum .",
    "but what should be stressed is that as is discussed in the case of 4d toy model @xcite the effects of these additional modes are not important and neglecting them is valid in the following discussions .",
