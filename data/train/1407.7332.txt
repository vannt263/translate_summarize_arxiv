    "this motivated @xcite and @xcite to take into account stellar rotation , macroturbulence , and thermal / pressure / instrumental broadenings in modeling the stellar absorption line profiles . those authors derived an analytic formula for the velocity anomaly of the rm effect by maximizing the cross - correlation function between the in - transit spectrum and the stellar template spectrum . as a result ,",

    "the stellar rotation affects the frequency spectrum of stellar oscillation modes .",
    "it induces a multiplet fine structure , whose frequency separation is dependent on the internal rotation profile of the star as well as the stellar structure , for each mode .",
    "more importantly , the apparent profiles of the rotationally induced frequency multiplets are very sensitive to the inclination angle of the stellar rotation axis with respect to the line - of - sight , @xmath1 . in turn",
    ", one can infer @xmath1 quite well from asteroseismology .",
    "one might wonder how commonly stellar oscillations that enable asteroseismology can be detected among the host stars of exoplanet systems .",
    "remember that transiting planet hunting preferentially select stars with small radii ( i.e. low - mass stars in the main sequence ) in order to increase the relative transit depth in the photometric lightcurve .",
    "moreover , such low - mass stars are suitable for the radial velocity follow - up not only because they are more affected by orbital motion of planets but also because they have sharp and narrow absorption lines due to their slow spin rotation velocity .",
    "such low - mass , cool stars have a thick convective envelope ( as in the case of the sun ) that sustains pulsations .",
    "turbulent motion with speeds close to that of sound near the stellar surface stochastically generates acoustic waves , which propagate inside the star until they are damped . the oscillations with frequencies close to those of eigenmodes of the star are eventually sustained as many acoustic modes",
    ". therefore cool ( _ i.e. _ @xmath27 k ) host stars for exoplanets should commonly exhibit solar - like oscillations , and thus consitute good targets for asteroseismology .    in this paper , we focus on two specific exoplanetary systems , hat - p-7 and kepler-25 ; hat - p-7 is the first example of a system hosting a retrograde or a polar - orbit planet , while kepler-25 is a multi - transiting system with three planets , making them two interesting examples . we show that joint analyses of asteroseismology , transit lightcurve , and the rm effect provide stringent orbital parameter estimates .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "section [ sec : previous ] summarizes the previous rm measurements and radial velocity ( rv ) data of the two systems .",
    "section [ sec : asteroseismology ] presents a detailed description of the basic principle of asteroseismology , followed by our main results of asteroseismology for the two stars in sections [ sec : asteroseismology : hatp7 ] and [ sec : asteroseismology : k25 ] .",
    "sections [ sec : hat - p-7 ] and [ sec : kepler-25 ] analyze the _ kepler _ transit lightcurves and the rv anomaly of the rm effect , using the asteroseismology results as a prior , and show how the joint analysis improves the estimates of the system parameters .",
    "section [ sec : summary ] is devoted to further discussion , and section [ sec:9 ] summarises the present paper .",
    "the hat - p-7 system comprises a bright ( _ _ v__=10.5 ) f6 star and a hot jupiter transiting the host star with a 2.2-d period ( * ? ? ? * hereafter p08 ) .",
    "in addition to the significant spin  orbit misalignment first revealed by the subaru spectroscopy @xcite , the fact that the system is in the _ kepler _ field makes it very attractive as an asteroseismology target .",
    "interestingly , there have been three independent measurements of the rm effect for the hat - p-7 system , which all indicate the significant spin  orbit misalignment , but do not agree quantitatively .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter w09 ) performed the joint analysis of the spectroscopic and photometric transit of hat - p-7b to obtain @xmath28 .",
    "for rvs , they analyzed 17 spectra observed with the high resolution spectrograph ( hires ) on the keck i telescope as well as 69 spectra observed with the high dispersion spectrograph ( hds ) on the subaru telescope .",
    "eight of the hires spectra were from p08 and taken in 2007 , while the other nine were obtained in 2009 . among 69 hds spectra ,",
    "40 were obtained on 2009 july 1 that spanned a transit .    on the other hand , @xcite ( hereafter n09 ) determined @xmath29 ( equivalently @xmath30 ) based on the eight hires rvs from p08 and 40 hds spectra spanning the transit on 2008 may 30 .",
    "although they fixed the transit parameters in the analysis of the rm effect , the systematics from the uncertainties of these parameters do not seem to explain the mild discrepancy with the w09 result , according to their discussion ( see cases 1 to 4 in section 4 of n09 ) .",
    "later on , @xcite ( hereafter a12 ) reported another measurement of the rm effect , resulting in @xmath31 .",
    "they analyzed 49 hires spectra spanning a transit on the night 2010 july 23/24 with the priors on transit parameters and ephemeris from the _ kepler _ lightcurves .    in this paper , we use the same rv data published in each of the three papers . since the origin of the possible discrepancy in @xmath3 is not clear , we analyze each data set separately instead of combining the three .",
    "the kepler-25 system is one of the few multi - transiting planetary systems with constrained @xmath3 .",
    "it consists of a relatively bright ( @xmath32 ) host star , two short - period neptune - sized planets confirmed with transit timing variations ( ttvs ) @xcite , and one outer non - transiting planet detected in long - term rv trend @xcite .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter a13 ) measured @xmath33 for the larger transiting planet kepler-25c based on the hires spectra observed for two nights ( 2011 july 18/19 and 2012 may 31/june 1 ) .",
    "since the signal - to - noise ratio of the rv anomaly was small due to the relatively small radius of kepler-25c , they also analyzed the time - dependent distortion of the spectral lines directly [ known as the `` doppler shadow '' method ; see @xcite ] and obtained a consistent result , @xmath34 .",
    "in this paper , we analyze the rvs around the above two transits from a13 alone because our focus is the determination of @xmath0 .",
    "due to its sensitivity to the stellar internal structure , asteroseismology can achieve high - precision determinations of stellar fundamental parameters @xcite ( e.g. , uncertainties of a few percent level for their mass and radius ) .",
    "the stellar modelling using seismic observables mostly relies on the stellar pulsation frequencies , usually extracted from the analysis of the power spectrum of the stellar lightcurve .    for a spherically symmetric star , each eigenmode",
    "is characterised by three quantum numbers ; the angular degree @xmath35 , the azimuthal order @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) , and the radial order @xmath38 .",
    "the degree @xmath35 corresponds to the number of nodal surface lines , while the azimuthal order @xmath36 specifies the surface pattern of the eigenfunction , with @xmath39 being the number of longitude lines among the @xmath35 nodal surface lines .",
    "the radial order @xmath38 corresponds to the number of nodal surfaces along the radius . for a non - rotating star , both the radial eigenfunction and the frequency of each mode",
    "are independent of @xmath36 and show the @xmath40-fold degeneracy .",
    "the eigenfrequency @xmath41 depends on @xmath35 and @xmath38 alone .",
    "frequencies of high order , acoustic ( or p- ) modes of the same low degree @xmath42 are almost equally spaced and separated on average by a frequency spacing @xmath43 : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a constant of order unity , and @xmath46 is a small correction .",
    "the spacing is related to the sound velocity inside the star by @xmath47 and is sensitive to the mean stellar density @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , knowing the solar density @xmath49kgm@xmath50 and its frequency spacing @xmath51 @xmath52hz , one can estimate the mean stellar density from the scaling : @xmath53 the stellar rotation lifts the degeneracy among non - radial modes ( @xmath54 ) , revealing a fine structure of modes identified by their azimuthal order @xmath36 . in the case of solar - like oscillations ,",
    "acoustic modes are excited stochastically by turbulent convection .",
    "this mechanism is expected to generate almost the same amplitudes in the rotationally split modes with the same @xmath35 and @xmath38 .",
    "if this is the case , in disk - integrated photometry as achieved by _ kepler _ , the height of the azimuthal modes in the power spectrum is sensitive to the stellar inclination angle @xmath1 due to a geometrical projection effect [ see @xcite for more details ] and has been widely used to evaluate @xmath1 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "solar - like oscillators such as kepler-25 and hat - p-7 are typically slow rotators for which the centrifugal force can be neglected .",
    "in addition , there is no evidence of a strong magnetic field and we can safely neglect it @xcite . if the internal rotation of the star is independent of the latitude and the longitude , the split frequencies are simply written as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the rotational splitting [ e.g. @xcite ] .

    ", this can not explain the low mass found by @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , although the model in figure 2 of @xcite has a small value of @xmath77 , it does not seem to reproduce accurately their individual frequencies .",
    "moreover their method of measuring the frequencies differs from ours ( frequencies are measured by taking the frequency at maximum height of a smooth spectrum ) and they reported larger uncertainties than what we obtain here .    in order to see if the difference in methodology could explain the apparent discrepancies , we looked for the best model ( minimum @xmath77 ) assuming @xmath78 , to be coherent with @xcite .",
    "the best model has a @xmath79 , approximately 14 times higher than the best model shown in table [ tab : output_model ] and does not reproduce accurately the individual oscillation frequencies .",
    "the mean stellar density @xmath80kgm@xmath50 is also significantly different .",
    "thus we conclude that mass of @xmath81 is less favored than @xmath82 , from our seismic observables .",
    "the best - fit model of the present study implies that the hat - p-7 has a convective core that extends up to 6.9% of the stellar radius , while the outer convective zone represents approximately 13.1% of the stellar radius .",
    "the central hydrogen abundance @xmath83 , which corresponds to 32% of its initial core hydrogen , indicates that the star is at a late stage in its main sequence .",
    "finally we note that the best model of hat - p-7 has no need of surface effect correction .",

    "the top and middle panels of figure [ best_tra_occ ] respectively show the transit and occultation lightcurves stacked using the revised ephemeris .",
    "the lightcurves are binned into @xmath63-minute bins and the uncertainty of the flux at the @xmath128-th bin , @xmath129 , is calculated as @xmath130 divided by the square root of the number of data points in the bin @xcite .",
    "solid lines are the best - fit lightcurves obtained from the simultaneous fit to both lightcurves .",
    "we use the transit model by @xcite , and binned model fluxes are calculated by averaging fluxes sampled at 0.1-minute interval . in this figure , the transit and occultation are shifted in time by @xmath131 and @xmath132 , respectively , where @xmath131 is the central time of the phase - folded transit lightcurve .",
    "this parameter is introduced to take into account the uncertainty in @xmath116 , and the best - fit value of @xmath131 is indeed within that uncertainty ( see table [ tab : hatp7-joint ] ) . in the transit residuals ( top panel ) , we reproduce the anomaly first reported by @xcite , who attributed it to the planet - induced gravity darkening .",
    "since the asymmetry of the planetary orbit alters the relative duration of the transit and occultation , as well as their time interval , one can tightly constrain the orbital eccentricity from the combination of transits and occultations ; see equations ( 33 ) and ( 34 ) in @xcite for instance . the bottom panel of figure [ best_tra_occ ] illustrates this subtle effect by comparing the best - fit transit and occultation lightcurves . here the depth of the occultation is scaled by @xmath133 , the occultation depth divided by @xmath134 , for ease of comparison . in this panel ,",
    "the egress of the occultation occurs slightly later than that of the transit , while the difference is smaller for their ingresses .",
    "in other words , our best - fit model indicates that the occultation duration is longer than the transit one and that the center of occultation deviates from @xmath135 .",
    "these are most likely due to the asymmetry of the orbit introduced by the slight but non - zero eccentricity , as well as the time delay of @xmath136 days due to the finite speed of light ( twice the orbital semi - major axis divided by the speed of light ; calculated for @xmath137 ) .",
    "in fact , with the non - zero eccentricity and the above light - travel time included , the simultaneous fit to the phase - folded transit and occultation lightcurves give tight constraints on the planet s eccentricity , @xmath138 and @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is the argument of periastron measured from the plane of the sky .",
    "since @xmath141 and @xmath120 are degenerate in determining the transit durations , the tight constraint on @xmath141 also allows the accurate determination of @xmath120 , and hence the mean stellar density @xmath48 independently from asteroseismology @xcite .",
    "we obtain @xmath142 from the above fit , and then deduce @xmath143 from @xmath144 where @xmath145 denotes the gravitational constant , and @xmath146 can be neglected .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but here we show that this method is also useful for such a low - eccentricity orbit .",
    "furthermore , our result is even more precise and reliable because it takes into account the independent constraint on @xmath48 and @xmath124 from the occultation lightcurve .",
    "second , we obtain the probability distribution for the three - dimensional spin ",
    "orbit angle @xmath0 in a consistent manner . in the case of hat - p-7 ,",

    "* ) .    in this context",

    "they may be constrained from the analysis of ttvs and transit duration variations ( tdvs ) , along with orbital rvs to constrain the orbit of the outer non - transiting planet d. in this paper , we did not model these phenomena because our main concern is the determination of the spin  orbit angle .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the independent information on @xmath48 from asteroseismology benefits the ttv analysis as well because ttvs are sensitive to the mean stellar density and orbital eccentricity of the planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . +   it is also interesting to note that both hat - p-7 and kepler-25 are relatively hot stars with @xmath337 and in line with the observed trend that the spin  orbit misalignments are preferentially found around stars with @xmath338 @xcite .",
    "although @xcite suggested that temporal variations of the stellar rotation due to internal gravity waves could explain this empirical trend , we found no evidence to support this scenario for the two systems .",

    "combined with the orbital inclination @xmath2 determined for transiting systems , and with the projected spin - orbit angle @xmath3 via the spectroscopic observation of the rossiter - mclaughlin effect , the joint analysis presented in this paper indeed enables the determination of @xmath0 , rather than @xmath3 .",
    "while the observed distribution of @xmath3 for more than 70 transiting systems [ e.g. , figure 7 of @xcite ] already put tight constraints on planetary migration scenarios , that of @xmath0 is even more useful because it is free from the projection effect .",

    "<S> we develop a detailed methodology of determining three - dimensionally the angle between the stellar spin and the planetary orbit axis vectors , @xmath0 , for transiting planetary systems . </S>",
    "<S> the determination of @xmath0 requires the independent estimates of the inclination angles of the stellar spin axis and of the planetary orbital axis with respect to the line - of - sight , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and the projection of the spin  orbit angle onto the plane of the sky , @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> these are mainly derived from asteroseismology , transit lightcurve and the rossiter - mclaughlin effect , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed joint analysis of those three datasets enables an accurate and precise determination of the numerous parameters characterizing the planetary system , in addition to @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the power of the joint analysis for the two specific systems , hat - p-7 and kepler-25 . </S>",
    "<S> hat - p-7b is the first exoplanet suspected to be a retrograde ( or polar ) planet because of the significant misalignment @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> our joint analysis indicates @xmath5 and @xmath6 , suggesting that the planetary orbit is closer to polar rather than retrograde . </S>",
    "<S> kepler-25 is one of the few multi - transiting planetary systems with measured @xmath3 , and hosts two short - period transiting planets and one outer non - transiting planet . </S>",
    "<S> the projected spin  orbit angle of the larger transiting planet , kepler-25c , has been measured to be @xmath7 , implying that the system is well - aligned . with the help of the tight constraint from asteroseismology , however , we obtain @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and thus find that the system is actually mildly misaligned . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first detection of the spin  orbit misalignment for the multiple planetary system with a main - sequence host star , and points to mechanisms that tilt a stellar spin axis relative to its protoplanetary disk . </S>"
