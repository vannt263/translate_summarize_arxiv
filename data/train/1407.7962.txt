    "the diameter and the height of the glass ring are @xmath18 mm and @xmath8 mm , respectively . after being injected into the plasma , charged grain levitates nearby the glass wall . due to the circular symmetry of the glass ring",
    "the grain travels around the glass ring or stays near its equilibrium position .",
    "we firstly show the regular movement of a single grain around the glass ring in 2d horizontal plane as shown in fig .",
    "2 . figure 2(a ) shows an epicycloid motion with inward petals .",
    "this meandering motion can be regarded as a compound of two circular motions , where the primary circle ( radius @xmath19 ) orbits the secondary circle ( radius @xmath20 ) in one direction with angular velocity @xmath21 and spins about its center in the same direction with angular velocity @xmath22 as shown by the diagram of fig .",

    "the radius @xmath28 and the angular velocity @xmath29 follow the condition : @xmath30 this means that the linear speed of the secondary circle is equal or greater than that of the primary circle , which leads to the appearance of the cusps on the cuspate cycloid trajectories .",

    "2(e ) . the angular speed of circular motion of grain changes within the range of 0.05 - 1.23 rad / s .",
    "stationary grain is observed both inside and outside the glass ring as shown in fig .",
    "2(f ) . in this case",
    "the resultant force acting on the grain should be zero . in the absent of action with other grain ,",
    "the grain is considerably stable at higher gas pressure .",
    "however , brownian motion of grain is observed clearly at lower gas pressure .",
    "the grain moves stochastically near its equilibrium position .",
    "this has also been reported by other groups @xcite .",
    "which trajectory a grain will follow is determined by the initial conditions ( such as the initial position ) of the dropped grain and the discharge parameters .",
    "this means that for several grains dropped simultaneously ( or one grain dropped repeatedly ) , they ( it ) will exhibit different trajectories because their ( its ) initial conditions are not exactly the same .",
    "therefore , the dependencies of the parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 mentioned above on the gas pressure and the forward power of discharge could not be illustrated evidently . in our experiments ,",
    "the radii of the primary and the secondary circles change within the range of @xmath19@xmath6@xmath31 mm and @xmath20@xmath6@xmath32 mm , respectively .",

    "the ( cuspate ) cycloid motions of grains follow the equations in polar coordinate :    @xmath35    where , `` + '' and `` - '' correspond the cases of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively . @xmath38 and @xmath39 represent the radial and azimuth positions of grain in polar coordinate , respectively .",

    "2 can be reproduced well in term of the eqs .",
    "( 1)-(4 ) .      the force analysis for a nonspherical grain , like the pine pollen we used , becomes very complex .",
    "these forces mainly include the gravitation force , electrostatic force , ion drag force , neutral friction force , and magnus force .",
    "the magnus force , which originates from the spin of a grain , is considered here for the first time . the interaction force between grains",
    "is not considered in the present case because only one or few grains separated well are dropped in each experiment .",
    "the gravitation force @xmath44@xmath6@xmath45 acts downward vertically and will not be considered here because our emphases is on the horizontal motion of the dust grain .",
    "the electrostatic force originates from the action of sheath field on the negatively - charged grain . in the present of glass ring",
    "the sheath profile follows approximately the wall of the glass ring and the electrode .",
    "when the diameter of the glass ring is small , the horizontal confinement to the grain could be described by a parabolic potential @xcite .",
    "the grains are confined in the center of the glass ring . here",
    ", the glass ring is relatively large , and the grain is restricted near the glass wall both inside and outside . the horizontal confinement inside the glass ring is represented approximately by a quartic equation :    @xmath46    here , @xmath38 represents the radial distance to the center of the glass ring , @xmath47 controls the well depth , and @xmath48 , @xmath49 control the well position in the radial direction . for the sake of simplicity , the horizontal confinement outside the glass ring has a mirror symmetry about the glass wall as shown by the solid lines in fig . 5 ( a ) .",
    "the upward vertical component of the sheath field acts against the downward gravitation force .",
    "the horizontal component of the sheath field plays important role on the complex motion of grain in horizontal plane .",
    "ion drag force acting on the grain by ion flow results mainly from coulomb drag and collection drag , and has been explored extensively .",
    "together with the neutral drag and the plasma charging flux , the ion drag could give rise to the spin of the immersed grain .",
    "the spin of a hollow transparent glass microsphere with surface defect was observed in a stratified glow discharge by karasev @xmath50 @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "the values of angular velocity measured in their experiments are between 0 and 12000 rad / s . as a rule ,",
    "for the nonspherical grain as we used here , the pine pollen would spin faster than the glass microsphere they used because the surface of pine pollen is much irregular than that of glass microsphere .",
    "the rapid spin of the pine pollen around its center of inertia gives rise to the magnus force which plays important role on the complex motions of grains .",
    "acting on a spinning grain.,width=188,height=188 ]    the magnus force results from the spin of a grain as illustrated by fig.4 . in term of the bernoulli principle ,",
    "the pressure on the left of a spinning grain would be different from that on the right while the grain travelling forward .",
    "the pressure difference between the left and right sides gives rise to the magnus force @xmath52 : @xmath53 here , @xmath54 and @xmath55 represent the vectors of angular velocity and travelling velocity of a spinning grain , respectively .",
    "@xmath56 is the diameter of grain .",
    "@xmath57 is the density of fluid .",
    "@xmath58 is a coefficient related with the shape of the grain .",
    "the direction of magnus force acting on the grain is always perpendicular to the travelling direction of the grain , therefore the magnus force provides the main centrifugal force for the cycloid motion of grain travelling along the primary circle . here",
    ", we focus on the case that the vector of angular velocity of the spinning grain is along the vertical direction , i.e. , the magnus force acting on the grain is always along the horizontal plane . if we assume that the magnus force equals approximately to the centrifugal force of the primary circle , then we have @xmath59@xmath60@xmath61@xmath60@xmath10@xmath62@xmath63 rad / s .",
    "here , we suppose @xmath58@xmath60@xmath64 for the pine pollen , which is five times than that for the microsphere .",
    "therefore , the average value of angular velocity of spin is about @xmath65@xmath603@xmath62@xmath66 rad / s .",
    "this value is reasonably larger than that observed by karasev @xmath50 @xmath51 because the pine pollen we used is more irregular than the hollow transparent glass microsphere they used .",
    "however , experimental detection of such a grain spinning faster is out of the reach of our camera at present . in order to confirm the distinctive features of the cycloid motions the pine pollen has exhibited as shown above ,",
    "further experiments with glass and resin microspheres are performed at the same discharge conditions for comparison ( not shown here ) .",
    "no cycloid motion is observed .",
    "those regular microspheres show behaviours such as the random motion and the crystallization as other groups observed previously .",
    "therefore , we can draw a conclusion that the spin of the pine pollen gives rise to the magnus force which provides the centrifugal force for the primary circle .",
    "the neutral drag force is a resistance force caused by the collisions with the neutral gas molecules .",
    "it damps the motion of grain .",
    "therefore a driving force is necessary for the grain to keep moving forward along the orbit .",
    "although the origin of this unknown driving force is still unclear at present , we can give some suggestions .",
    "1 ) it should be related with the irregularity of the grain , because our comparison experiments with glass and resin microspheres have shown that no cycloid motion and no circle motion are observed .",
    "several groups also reported the rotation of nonspherical agglomerates of microspheres @xcite .",
    "the rotation of microsphere is observed only in magnetized dust plasma , which is induced by the lorentz force @xcite .",
    "2 ) this driving force is nondirectional with regard to the glass ring because both clockwise and counterclockwise rotations are observed .",
    "3 ) it should be the same order of magnitude of the neutral drag force because the grain could continue to move uniformly along the glass ring . in the following",
    "we will neglect the counteractive neutral drag force and driving force .",
    "( dashed line ) indicates the position of the minima value of confinement potential .",
    "@xmath67 is the horizontal component of the resultant force a grain suffered when it is between the equilibrium line @xmath68 and the glass wall . outside this region , it is expressed as @xmath69 .",
    "( b ) shows four cases of complex trajectories in horizontal plane .",
    "( i)-(iii ) show the hypocycloid motions , and ( iv ) shows the epicycloid motion .",
    "@xmath52 represents the magnus force .",
    "@xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) is the cyclotron radius when the grain is near ( far away from ) the glass wall.,width=302,height=302 ]    in term of the above force analysis we explain next the complex motions of grains .",
    "for these regular trajectories observed in 2d horizontal plane we make the following assumptions for simplicity : 1 ) the vector of angular velocity of the spinning grain points downward , i.e. , the grain spins clockwise ; 2 ) the grain rotates clockwise around the primary circle , i.e. , the value @xmath22@xmath26@xmath25 ; 3 ) the values of angular velocity @xmath65 and travelling velocity @xmath72 remain constant , i.e. , the magnitude of magnus force @xmath52 does not change .",
    "4 ) the resultant force of the horizontal components of electrostatic force and ion drag force in radial direction is indicated by @xmath67 when the grain is located between the equilibrium line @xmath68 and the glass wall as shown in fig .",
    "5(a ) . outside this region ,",
    "it is expressed as @xmath69 . in general , @xmath67@xmath24@xmath69 due to the steep sheath near the glass wall .",
    "our observations of the ( cuspate ) cycloid motions of grains can be classified roughly into four groups ( i)-(iv ) as shown by the diagrams in fig . 5 ( b ) .    for the case ( i ) ,",
    "the grain meanders between the equilibrium line @xmath68 and the glass wall . when the grain approaches the wall both the magnus force @xmath52 and @xmath73 act inwards .",
    "far away from the glass wall , on the contrary , the two forces act in the opposite direction as shown in fig .",
    "the centrifugal forces in the two cases are :    @xmath74    where , @xmath70 and @xmath71 represent the cyclotron radii near and far away from the glass wall , respectively",
    ". therefore , the cyclotron radii @xmath70@xmath26@xmath71 .",
    "the cyclotron radius changes periodically as the grain travelling , which results in the hypocycloid motion .",
    "if the rotation of grain is more closer to the glass wall , the forces @xmath73 and @xmath75 become stronger and the cyclotron radius @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) becomes more smaller ( larger ) .",
    "this could lead to the formation of cuspate hypocycloid motion of grain as illustrated by fig .",
    "the above analysis is applicable to the case ( iii ) , in which the grain also follows ( cuspate ) hypocycloid trajectory .    for the case ( ii ) ,",
    "the grain meanders near the equilibrium line @xmath68 . when the grain approaches the glass wall both the magnus force @xmath52 and @xmath67 act inwards . when it is far away the glass wall , the two forces act outwards as shown in fig .",
    "the centrifugal forces in the two cases read :    @xmath76    here , @xmath67 is slightly larger than @xmath69 due to the steep sheath near the glass wall , therefore the cyclotron radii @xmath70@xmath26@xmath71 .",
    "similarly , the periodical change of cyclotron radius gives rise to the hypocycloid trajectory as illustrated by fig .",
    "the above force analysis is also applicable to the case ( iv ) .",
    "however , because the small cyclotron radius @xmath70 is located on the left of the equilibrium line @xmath68 in case ( iv ) , the periodical change of cyclotron radius results in the epicycloid trajectory as illustrated by fig .",
    "particularly , if the grain is more closer to the glass wall , @xmath67 becomes stronger , the petals would turn into cusps , which results in the formation of cuspate epicycloid trajectory as illustrated by fig .",
    "2(b ) .    for stationary grain as shown in fig .",
    "2(f ) , the resultant force acting on it in horizontal plane should be zero .",
    "the grain should stay at the bottom of the sheath .",
    "therefore , the position of the stationary grain can be used to indicate as the equilibrium line @xmath68 . for the grain following circle trajectory as shown in fig .",
    "2(e ) , it locates on the outside of the equilibrium line @xmath68 .",
    "the resultant force acting on it points to the center of the glass ring and plays the role of centripetal force which leads to the circle motion . in both cases ,",
    "the grain could spin slightly , and the magnus force is too small to give rise to the cycloid motion of grain .",
    "we consider the motion of a charged grain with mass @xmath77 .",
    "the grain is confined in the potential @xmath78 as described by eq .",

    "these relations are in accordance with eqs .",
    "( 1)-(2 ) .",
    "in this work , we have studied the cycloid motion of an irregular grain ( pine pollen ) in unmagnetized dusty plasma in 2d horizontal plane .",
    "hypocycloid motions are observed both inside and outside the glass ring .",
    "epicycloid motion is observed only outside the glass ring .",
    "the stationary grain should stay at the bottom of the sheath and can be used to indicate the equilibrium line @xmath68 .",
    "circle motions are observed on the outside of the equilibrium line .",

    "the magnitude of angular velocity of spin is estimated to be of the order @xmath65@xmath117@xmath66 rad / s .",
    "based on the force analysis and numerical simulations in 2d horizontal plane , the mechanisms of these cycloid motions are discussed .",
    "the observed cycloid motion of grain originates from the periodical change of cyclotron radius near and far from the glass wall .",
    "as is well known , the magnus and lorentz forces are characteristic of their transverse action with respect to the travelling direction of an object .",
    "no magnetic field is applied in our experiments .",
    "therefore , only the magnus force appears and provides the main centrifugal force for the rotation of grain along the primary circle .",
    "recently , some studies focused on the magnus force effect in optical manipulation @xcite , in a bose - einstein condensate @xcite , and in lattice models of superfluids @xcite .",
    "they have revealed that the magnus force is larger than that predicted by theoretical models and allows one to perform particle trapping .",
    "our results have also revealed that the magnus force an irregular grain suffered in plasma environment can not be negligible and would play important role on the complex motions of the grains .",
    "it is also suggested that these complex motions of irregular grain we observed could be found in fusion reactors because the grown or sputtered grain could have considerable angular speed of spin .",
    "in addition , the vector of angular velocity of a spinning grain is not limited to the downward direction as we discussed above . due to the stochastic initial conditions of a dropped grain",
    ", this vector could point at other directions in three dimensional space .",
    "this means that the magnus force acting on a spinning grain could point out of the horizontal plane .",
    "therefore , the magnus force together with the other forces will give rise to more complex motions of a spinning grain in three dimensional space",

    "<S> hypocycloid and epicycloid motions of irregular grain ( pine pollen ) are observed for the first time in unmagnetized dust plasma in 2d horizontal plane . </S>",
    "<S> hypocycloid motions occur both inside and outside the glass ring which confines the grain . </S>",
    "<S> epicycloid motion only appears outside the glass ring . </S>",
    "<S> cuspate cycloid motions , circle motion , and stationary grain are also observed . </S>",
    "<S> all these motions are related with both the initial conditions of dropped grain and the discharge parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the magnus force originated from the spin of the irregular grain is confirmed by comparison experiments with regular microspheres , and it plays important role on these ( cuspate ) cycloid motions . </S>",
    "<S> the observed complex motions are explained in term of force analysis and numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> periodical change of the cyclotron radius as the grain travelling results in the ( cuspate ) cycloid motions . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the ( cuspate ) cycloid motions are distinctive features of irregular grain immersed in plasma . </S>"
