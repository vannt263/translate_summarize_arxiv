    "the search for supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the main goals of present and future colliders since it is one of the best motivated extensions of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "an important feature of susy models is the possibility of incorporating new sources of cp violation that are required to accommodate the baryon asymmetry of the universe . a careful analysis of how to observe new cp - violating effects at the lhc will be required and in the following we discuss an example in the minimal supersymmetric standard model .",
    "cp - odd observables are the unambiguous way of discovering hints of complex parameters in the underlying theory .",
    "one example of such observables are cp - sensitive asymmetries based on the exploitation of triple product correlations of momenta and/or spins of three final state particles with independent momentum , see also @xcite .    here",
    "we examine the production of @xmath0 at the lhc with the following decay chain , fig .",
    "[ fig : fulldiagram ] , @xmath1    in this process @xcite the main source of cp - violation comes from the phase of the top trilinear coupling @xmath2 . as an observable we choose the t@xmath3-odd triple product of momenta of the final state particles ,",
    "@xmath4 using this triple product one can construct a cp - odd asymmetry , @xmath5 where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) are the numbers of events for which @xmath8 is positive ( negative ) .    at the parton level ,",
    "in the stop @xmath9 rest frame , the asymmetry can be as large as @xmath10 , cf .",
    "[ fig : partonasy](a ) .",
    "however , particles produced at the lhc get large , undetermined boosts that are a consequence of the internal proton structure . due to these boosts the asymmetry is strongly diluted as can be seen by comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : partonasy](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : partonasy](b ) .",
    "this makes the observation and analysis of cp - violating effects very difficult at the lhc . for further discussion of these effects and other studies of cp - violation in stop",
    "decays at the lhc see  @xcite .",
    "we show that a very useful tool in such an analysis is the reconstruction of momenta of all the particles involved in the process , including those escaping detection ( @xmath11 ) . using this technique one can recover the large asymmetry present at the parton level by boosting back into the rest frame of the stop .",
    "furthermore , we can heavily suppress both standard model and susy backgrounds using reconstruction .",
    "therefore , we greatly increase the discovery potential and here we present the first hadronic study of momentum reconstruction in relation to cp - violation .",
    "the technique of momentum reconstruction for cp - violating observables was first presented in  @xcite .",

    "our observable , eq .  , is significantly reduced due to boosts compared with the asymmetry in the stop rest frame , where it is maximal , see fig .",
    "[ fig : partonasy](a ) .",
    "this is because a boosted frame can make the momentum vector of the lepton appear to come from the opposite side of the plane formed by @xmath14 and @xmath15 , hence changing the sign of the triple product , eq .",
    "( [ eq : triple ] ) .",
    "inclusion of pdfs reduce the asymmetry by about factor of 4 in our case .",
    "the maximum asymmetry is about @xmath16 and if we use this asymmetry at the lhc it would be of limited statistical significance .",
    "in order to overcome the dilution factor due to pdfs , we investigate the possibility of reconstructing the momenta of the invisible particles ( @xmath11 ) in the process on an event by event basis  @xcite .",

    "once we have the @xmath11 momentum we can trivially find the momentum of any other particle in the cascade decay .",
    "we can therefore find the momentum of the @xmath9 and boost all final state particles into this frame to recover the full asymmetry .",
    "there is a complication in finding the @xmath11 momentum because if we solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : mneu1]-[eq : mstop1 ] ) we see that we are left with a quadratic in @xmath28 .",
    "consequently , we will have two viable solutions for the @xmath11 momentum but we can not know which is correct . since we do not have any additional constraints to pick the correct solution",

    "however we only count those events that give the same sign for the triple product , eq .",
    "( [ eq : triple ] ) .",
    "this guarantees that we take the correct sign for the triple product for the calculation of the asymmetry .",
    "in addition , this method also significantly reduces the combinatorial background from wrong lepton or jet identification and both standard model and susy backgrounds @xcite .",
    "for example , we need to correctly identify the near and far lepton in the cascade decay , eq .",
    "[ eq : simpdec ] , and our method is to try to perform reconstruction with both lepton assignments .",
    "firstly , only a small subset of events with the wrong assignment will give real solutions for the @xmath11 momentum . secondly ,",
    "if the wrong assignment does satisfy the kinematical conditions , we only accept events where the sign of all triple products coincide .",
    "as one solution will have the true assignment we know the sign of the triple product will be correct and thus we will kill the combinatorial background .",

    "we also apply realistic cuts for the lhc , implement experimental efficiencies ( e.g. @xmath20-tagging ) .",
    "in addition , we require a top within a mass window to be reconstructed and include the most important standard model backgrounds . within this scenario",
