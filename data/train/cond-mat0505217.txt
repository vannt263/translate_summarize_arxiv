    "the diffusion of particles in a condensed phase is a fundamental transport process which is ubiquitous in natural phenomena .",
    "since the pioneering work by einstein in 1905 , it is known that diffusion is related to conduction or mobility .",
    "although diffusion has been extensively studied in classical systems , much less is known in quantum systems where the quantum effects can deeply affect the transport properties at low temperature . yet",
    ", the theoretical understanding of quantum diffusion remains sparse and difficult because diffusion is an incoherent process very remote from the very coherent basic quantum dynamics .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to study a simple model of quantum diffusion in a system which possesses the property of being invariant under spatial translations .",
    "this property is a fundamental feature of systems sustaining transport processes such as diffusion or conduction .",
    "the translational invariance is at the basis of the early studies of electronic conduction based on the boltzmann - lorentz equation @xcite , and is also important in the polaron model @xcite . motivated by the problem of dissipation in quantum macroscopic phenomena ,",
    "models of quantum brownian motion have been proposed and studied since the eighties @xcite . in such models , one degree of freedom",
    "has a diffusive - like motion in an external potential which breaks the translational invariance .",
    "these models were later extended to the study of transport in spatially periodic potentials @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "attention was focused essentially on diffusion . in the present study , we intend to study the complete set of the relaxation modes in the system by obtaining all the eigenvalues of the time evolution superoperator .",
    "the complete diagonalization of the time evolution superoperator is accomplished by fully exploiting the translational invariance with bloch s theorem applied to the density matrices .",
    "this allows us to introduce in a rigorous way a wavenumber and to obtain the eigenvalues which gives the liouvillian resonances as functions of the wavenumber .",
    "these resonances provides us with the characteristic times of the relaxation toward the thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the hydrodynamic mode of diffusion is one among the eigenstates associated with the liouvillian resonances .",
    "this mode controls the long - time dynamics of the system .",
    "the other modes control the shorter time scales and are associated with decoherence . in the quantum model here studied , analytical expressions can be obtained in this way for the dispersion relation of diffusion and the other resonances .",
    "we notice that translationally invariant models without coupling to the environment have recently been studied in such models as quantum graphs @xcite quantum multibaker maps @xcite , as well as quantum periodic lorentz gases @xcite .",
    "these models describe the motion of a quantum particle in a spatially periodic potential .",
    "the energy spectrum of the particle is composed of energy bands so that the motion is ballistic on long - time scales .",
    "if the energy of the particle is distributed over many energy bands , the motion becomes semiclassical and diffusion may manifest itself as a transient behavior before the long - time ballistic motion .",
    "this has been remarkably demonstrated for the quantum multibaker map in ref .",
    "in order for diffusion to persist up to arbitrarily long times , the quantum system must contain infinitely many degrees of freedom , for instance , by the coupling with some environment in the subsystem - plus - reservoir approach we adopt in the present paper .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following .",
    "our translationally invariant model is defined in sec .",
    "[ sec.system ] by weakly coupling a one - dimensional tight - binding hamiltonian to a delta - correlated environment .",
    "the dynamics of this system is ruled by a redfield quantum master equation @xcite .",
    "the long - time evolution of the model can be studied in terms of the eigenvalues and the associated eigenstates of the redfield superoperator , as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec.diag ] .",
    "the eigenvalue problem is exactly solved for a finite chain in sec .",
    "[ sec.finite ] .",
    "the advantage of first taking a finite chain is that the total number of eigenvalues is known and we do not miss the part of the spectrum controlling decoherence .",
    "the liouvillian spectrum of the infinite chain is thereafter obtained in sec .",
    "[ sec.infinite ] by taking the limit @xmath0 .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sec . [ sec.conclusions ] .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional subsystem described by the following hamiltonian @xmath1 represented in the site basis @xmath2 , where @xmath3 takes the values @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 is the length of the chain .",
    "we have here chosen periodic ( born - van karman ) boundary conditions .",
    "this so - called tight - binding or hckel hamiltonian describes a process of quantum tunneling from site to site and is invariant under spatial translations .",
    "the stationary schrdinger equation of the tight - binding hamiltonian is given by @xmath6 where the eigenvalues are @xmath7 and the eigenvectors @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "accordingly , the hamiltonian ( [ isolaaa ] ) has an energy spectrum with a single energy band of width @xmath10 and the motion of the particle would be purely ballistic without coupling to a fluctuating environment .",
    "now , we suppose that the subsystem is coupled to a large environment .",
    "the hamiltonian of the total system composed of the one - dimensional chain and its environment is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the environment hamiltonian , @xmath13 the subsystem coupling operators , @xmath14 the environment coupling operators , and @xmath15 the coupling parameter which measures the intensity of the interaction between the subsystem and its environment .    the dynamics of the total system is described by the von neumann equation @xmath16 , \\label{isolabf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the liouvillian superoperator of the total system .",
    "we adopt the convention that @xmath18 .",
    "the reduced dynamics for the density matrix @xmath19 of the subsystem is known to obey a redfield quantum master equation for weak coupling to the environment @xcite .",
    "this equation can be systematically derived from the complete von neumann equation for the total system ( [ isolabf ] ) by second - order perturbation theory so that @xmath20 on time scales longer than the correlation time of the environment , the redfield quantum master equation is markovian and reads @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the so - called redfield superoperator and where @xmath23 the correlation function of the environment which contains all the necessary information to describe the coupling of the subsystem to its environment is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the canonical equilibrium state of the environment .",
    "the interaction of the subsystem with its environment is expressed in terms of the subsystem coupling operators which are projection operators on the site basis @xmath26 they take the unit value if the particle is located on the site @xmath27 and zero otherwise .",
    "these operators have the properties : @xmath28 for @xmath29 and @xmath30    we now need to specify the environment operators by the choice of the environment correlation functions .",
    "we make two assumptions : + : the environment dynamics has a very fast evolution compared with the subsystem dynamics .",
    "therefore , the environment correlation functions decay in time so fast with respect to the characteristic time scales of the subsystem evolution , that they can be assumed to be dirac delta distributions in time .",
    "+ : the environment has very short range spatial correlations , much shorter than the distance between two adjacent sites of the subsystem .",
    "accordingly , the environment correlation functions decay in space so fast that they can be assumed to be given by kronecker delta in space .",
    "+ these two assumptions mean that each of the environmental fluctuations at the different subsystem sites are statistically independent .",
    "the environment correlation functions are thus given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a real number .",
    "the operators ( [ isolaah ] ) in the redfield equation ( [ isolaag ] ) therefore become @xmath33 it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the form taken by the operator ( [ isolaak ] ) can be physically justified when @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the thermal time , @xmath36 the correlation time of the environment or bath , and @xmath37 the subsystem characteristic time .",
    "because of the fast decay of the temporal and the spatial correlations ( [ isolaaj ] ) and the properties of the subsystem coupling operators ( [ isolaal ] ) , the redfield equation we have to solve takes the form @xmath38 it can easily be verified by projecting this equation onto the site basis that it is translationally invariant ( shifting all the site indices appearing in the projected equation by a constant does not modify the equation ) .",
    "furthermore , this equation preserves the complete positivity of the density matrix because it has the lindblad form @xcite which is the result of a coupling with delta correlation functions @xcite .",
    "it should also be mentioned that eq .",
    "( [ isolaam ] ) can be directly derived from the complete von neumann equation for the total system ( [ isolabf ] ) in the singular coupling limit @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath39 and associated eigenstates @xmath40 of the redfield superoperator are defined by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a set of parameters labeling the eigenstates .",
    "because the redfield superoperator is not anti - hermitian , its eigenvalues can be complex numbers with a nonzero real part .",
    "the eigenvalue problem of the redfield superoperator is important because the time evolution of the quantum master equation can then be decomposed onto the basis of the eigenstates as @xmath43 the dynamics is therefore given by a linear superposition of exponential or oscillatory exponential functions .",
    "since the reduced density matrix of the subsystem has @xmath44 elements , there is a total of @xmath44 eigenvalues and associated eigenstates .",
    "since the system is invariant under spatial translations , we can apply the bloch theorem to the eigenstates of the redfield superoperator .",
    "thanks to this theorem , the state space of the superoperator can be decomposed into independent superoperators acting onto decoupled sectors associated with a given bloch number , also called wavenumber @xcite .",
    "we define the superoperator @xmath45 of the spatial translation by @xmath46 sites along the system ( @xmath46 is an integer ) as @xmath47 where we use the notation @xmath48 .",
    "this superoperator has the group property @xmath49 because of the translational symmetry of the system , the translation superoperators commute with the redfield superoperator @xmath50 = 0   \\ ; . \\label{blochaad}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , the redfield superoperator as well as the translation superoperators have a basis of common eigenstates . if @xmath51 denotes the eigenvalues of the translation superoperator , we have that @xmath52 where , because of the unitarity of @xmath45 , @xmath53 equation ( [ blochaac ] ) implies @xmath54 because of eqs .",
