    "changes in the appearance of the night sky , visible with the naked eye , have always called for explanations ( and speculations ) .",
    "but , although `` new stars '' , i.e. novae and supernovae , are observed by humans for thousands of years , the modern era of supernova research began only about one century ago on august 31 , 1885 , when hartwig discovered a `` nova '' near the center of the andromeda galaxy , which became invisible about 18 months later . in 1919",
    "lundmark estimated the distance of m31 to be about @xmath3 lyr , and by that time it became obvious that hartwig s nova had been several 1000 times brighter than a normal nova lu20(lundmark 1920 ) .",
    "it was also lu21lundmark ( 1921 ) who first suggested an association between the supernova observed by chinese astronomers in 1054 and the crab nebula .",
    "a similar event as s andromeda was observed in 1895 in ngc 5253 ( `` nova '' z centauri ) , and this time the `` new star '' appeared to be 5 times brighter than the entire galaxy , but it was not before 1934 that a clear distinction between classical novae and supernovae was made bz34(baade & zwicky 1934 ) .",
    "systematic searches , performed predominantly by zwicky , lead to the discovery of 54 supernovae in the years up to 1956 and , due to improved observational techniques , 82 further supernovae were discovered in the years from 1958 to 1963 , all of course in external galaxies zw65(e.g .",
    ", zwicky 1965 ) .    until 1937 spectrograms of supernovae were very rare , and what was known seemed to be not too different from common novae .",
    "this changed with the very bright ( m@xmath4 ) supernova sn1937c in ic 4182 which had spectral features very different from any object that had been observed before po37(popper 1937 ) .",
    "all of the other supernovae discovered in the following years showed very little dispersion in their maximum luminosity and their post - maximum spectra looked very similar at a given time . based on this finding wi39wilson ( 1939 ) and zw39zwicky ( 1938a ) suggested to use supernovae as distance indicators .    in 1940",
    "it became clear , however , that there exist at least two distinctly different classes of supernovae .",
    "sn1940c in ngc 4725 had a spectrum very different from all other previously observed supernovae for which good data were available at that time , leading mi40minkowski ( 1940 ) to introduce the names `` type i '' for those with spectra like sn1937c and `` type ii '' for sn 1940c - like events , representing supernovae without and with balmer - lines of hydrogen near maximum light .    whether or no the spectral differences also reflect a different explosion mechanism was not known . in contrast , the scenario originally suggested by zw38zwicky ( 1938b ) , that a supernova occurs as the transition from an ordinary star to a neutron star and gains its energy from the gravitational binding of the newly born compact object , was for many years the only explanation .",
    "hf60hoyle & fowler ( 1960 ) were the first to discover that thermonuclear burning in an electron - degenerate stellar core might trigger an explosion and ( possibly ) the disruption of the star .",
    "together with the idea that the light curves could be powered by the decay - energy of freshly produced radioactive @xmath5ni tac67,cm69(truran , arnett , & cameron 1967 ; colgate & mckee 1969 ) this scenario is now the generally accepted one for a sub - class of all type i supernovae called type ia today .",
    "it is a bit amusing to note that all supernovae ( besides the crab nebula ) on which zwicky had based his core - collapse hypothesis were in fact of type ia and most likely belonged to the other group , whereas the first core - collapse supernova , sn1940c , was observed only about one year after he published his paper .    to be more precise , supernovae which do not show hydrogen lines in their spectra but a strong silicon p cygni  feature near maximum light",
    "are named type ia wh90(wheeler & harkness 1990 ) .",
    "they are believed to be the result of thermonuclear disruptions of white dwarfs , either consisting of carbon and oxygen with a mass close to the chandrasekhar - mass , or of a low - mass c+o core mantled by a layer of helium , the so - called sub - chandrasekhar - mass models ( see the recent reviews by w97,ww94a , ww94bwoosley ( 1997b ) ; woosley & weaver ( 1994a , 1994b ) and nyse94,nine97nomoto et  al .",
    "( 1994b , 1997 ) ) .",
    "the main arguments in favor of this interpretation include : ( i ) the apparent lack of neutron stars in some of the historical galactic supernovae ( e.g. sn1006 , sn1572 , sn1604 ) ; ( ii ) the rather homogeneous appearance of this sub - class ; ( iii ) the excellent fits to the light curves , which can be obtained from the simple assumption that a few tenths of a solar mass of @xmath5ni is produced during the explosion ; ( iv ) the good agreement with the observed spectra of typical type ia supernovae .",
    "several of these observational aspects are discussed in some detail in section 2 , together with their cosmological implications .",
    "questions concerning the nature of the progenitor stars are addressed in section 3 , and models of light curves and spectra are reviewed in section 5 .    but having good arguments in favor of a particular explosion scenario does not mean that this scenario is indeed the right one .",
    "besides that one would like to understand the physics of the explosion , the fact that the increasing amount of data also indicates that there is a certain diversity among the type ia supernovae seems to contradict a single class of progenitor stars or a single explosion mechanism .",
    "moreover , the desire for using them as distance indicator makes it necessary to search for possible systematic deviations from uniformity . here , again , theory can make important contributions . in section 4 , therefore , we discuss the physics of thermonuclear combustion , its implementation into numerical models of exploding white dwarfs , and the results of recent computer simulations .",
    "a summary and conclusions follow in section 6 .",
    "the efforts to systematically obtain observational data of sne ia near and far have gained tremendous momentum in recent years .",

    "any viable scenario for the sn ia explosion mechanism has to satisfy the following ( necessary but probably not sufficient ) requirements :    1 .",
    "agreement of the ejecta composition and velocity with observed spectra and light curves . in general",
    ", the explosion must be sufficiently powerful ( i.e. , produce enough @xmath5ni ) and produce a substantial amount of high - velocity intermediate mass elements in the outer layers .",
    "furthermore , the isotopic abundances of `` normal '' sne ia must not deviate significantly from those found in the solar system .",
    "robustness of the explosion mechanism .",
    "in order to account for the homogeneity of normal sne ia , the standard model should not give rise to widely different outcomes depending on the fine - tuning of model parameters or initial conditions .",
    "3 .   intrinsic variability .",
    "while the basic model should be robust with respect to small fluctuations , it must contain at least one parameter that can plausibly account for the observed sequence of explosion strengths .",
    "correlation with progenitor system .",
    "the explosion strength parameter must be causally connected with the state of the progenitor white dwarf in order to explain the observed variations as a function of the host stellar population .",
    "next we have to discuss the problem of coupling the interior physics of an exploding white dwarf to what is finally observed , namely light curves and spectra , by means of radiative transfer calculations . for many astrophysical applications this problem",
    "is not solved , and sn ia are no exceptions .",
    "in fact , radiation transport is even more complex in type ia s than for most other cases .",
    "a rough sketch of the processes involved can illustrate some of the difficulties ( see , e.g. , ml93,ep93mazzali & lucy ( 1993 ) ; eastman & pinto ( 1993 ) ) . unlike most other objects we know in astrophysics sn ia",
    "do not contain any hydrogen .",
    "therefore the opacities are always dominated either by electron scattering ( in the optical ) or by a huge number of atomic lines ( in the uv ) . in the beginning , the supernova is an opaque expanding sphere of matter into which energy is injected from radioactive decay .",
    "this could happen in a very inhomogeneous manner , as will discussed later . as the matter expands",
    "diffusion times eventually get shorter than the expansion time and the supernova becomes visual . however , because the star is rapidly expanding the doppler - shift of atomic lines causes important effects . for example , a photon emitted somewhere in the supernova may find the surrounding matter more or less transparent until it finds a line doppler - shifted such that it is trapped in that line and scatters many times . as a consequence , the spectrum might look thermal although the photon `` temperature '' has nothing in common with the matter temperature .",
    "it is also obvious that radiation transport in sn ia is very non - local and that the methods used commonly in models of stellar atmospheres need refinements . as a consequence",
    ", there is no agreement yet among the groups modeling light - curves and spectra as to what the best approach is .",
    "therefore it can happen that even if the same model for the interior physics of the supernova is inserted into one of the existing codes for modeling light - curves and spectra the predictions for what should be `` observed '' could be different , again a very unpleasant situation .",
    "things get even worse because all such models treat the exploding star as being spherically symmetric , an assumption that is at least questionable , given the complex combustion physics discussed below .    in the following subsections",

    "however , to solve this time dependent , frequency dependent radiation transport problem , including the need of treating the atoms in non - lte , is very expensive , even in spherically symmetric situations .",
    "therefore , approximations of various kinds are usually made which give rise to controversial discussions .",
    "conceptually , it is best to formulate and solve the transport equation in the co - moving ( lagrangian ) frame ( cf .",
    "mm84mihalas & weibel mihalas ( 1984 ) ) .",
    "this makes the transport equation appear simpler , but causes problems in calculating the `` co - moving '' opacity , in particular if the effect of spectral lines on the opacity of an expanding shell of matter is important , as in the case of sn ia klce77(karp et  al .",
    "1977 ) .",
    "there are different ways to construct approximate solutions of the transport equation .",
    "one can integrate over frequency and replace the opacity terms by appropriate means , leaving a single ( averaged ) transport equation .",
    "unfortunately , in order to compute the flux - mean opacity one has to know the solution of the transport equation . frequently the flux - mean is replaced , for example , by the rosseland mean , allowing for solutions , but at the expense of consistency ( see , e.g. , e97eastman ( 1997 ) ) .",
    "another way out is to replace the transport equation by its moment expansion introducing , however , the problem of closure . in its simplest form , the diffusion approximation , the radiation field is assumed to be isotropic , the time rate of change of the flux is ignored , and the flux is expressed in terms of the gradient of the mean intensity of the radiation field . replacing",
    "the mean intensity by the planck function and closing the moment expansion by relating the radiation energy density and pressure via an eddington factor ( equal to 1/3 for isotropic radiation ) finally leads to a set of equations that can be solved mm84(mihalas & weibel mihalas 1984 ) .    again",
    ", this simple approach has several short - comings that are obvious .",
    "first of all , the transition from an optically thick to thin medium at the photosphere requires a special treatment mainly because the radiation field is no longer isotropic .",
    "one can compensate for this effect by either putting in a flux - limiter or a variable eddington factor to describe the transition from diffusion to free streaming , but both approaches are not fully satisfactory since it is difficult to calibrate the newly invented parameters ( e.g. , ku84,fu87,bn91,mhhe92 , smn92,ym95kunasz ( 1984 ) ; fu ( 1987 ) ; blinnikov & nadyoshin ( 1991 ) ; mair et  al .",
    "( 1992 ) ; stone , mihalas , & norman ( 1992 ) ; yin & miller ( 1995 ) ) .    alternatively , one can bin frequency space into groups and solve the set of fully time dependent coupled monochromatic transport equations for each bin . in this approach",
    "the problem remains to compute average opacities for each frequency bin .",
    "moreover , because of computer limitations , in all practical applications the number of bins can not be large which introduces considerable errors , given the strong frequency dependence of the line - opacities bn91,e97(blinnikov & nadyoshin 1991 ; eastman 1997 ) ( see also fig .",
    "1 ) .    finally , in order to get synthetic spectra one might apply monte - carlo techniques , as was done by mtce97mazzali et  al .",
    "( 1997b ) and lu99lucy ( 1999 ) .",
    "here the assumption is that the supernova envelope is in homologous spherical expansion and that the luminosity and the photospheric radius are given . the formation of spectral lines is then computed by considering the propagation of a wave packet emitted from the photosphere subject to electron scattering and interaction with lines . line formation is assumed to occur by coherent scattering , and the line profiles and escape probabilities are calculated in the sobolev approximation . while this approach appears to be a powerful tool to get synthetic spectra it lacks consistency since the properties of the photosphere have to be calculated be other means .",
    "= 0.80    but having a numerical scheme at hand to solve the transport equation is not sufficient .",

    "it is the current understanding and believe that the progenitors of sne ia are c+o white dwarfs in binary systems evolving to the stage of explosion by mass - overflow from the companion ( single - degenerate scenario ) or by the merger of two white dwarfs ( double - degenerate scenario ) .",
    "binary evolution of some sort is necessary because c+o white dwarfs a typically born with a mass around 0.6 m@xmath2 hkhe98(homeier et  al .",

    "since most of them are heavily extinct their total number might be sufficiently high ( dsr94di stefano & rappaport ( 1994 ) ; see also li96livio ( 1996 ) and ylte96yungelson et  al .",

    "1993 ) , too short to be related with the h - burning shell , possibly indicating substantial changes in the accretion rates .",
    "it may therefore not be justified to assume that the accretion rates we see now are sustained over several 10@xmath32 years .",
    "but their very existence provides a first and strong case for the single - degenerate scenario .",
    "secondly , also the minimum accretion rate at which hydrogen burns quietly without a nova outburst is rather uncertain .",
    "all models that compute this rate ignore important pieces of physics and , therefore , their predictions could be off by orders of magnitude .",
    "for example , classical nova outbursts require that the accreted hydrogen - rich envelope of the white dwarf is also heavily enriched in c and o from the white dwarf s core ( see , e.g. , stse72,sst76,sts78,tr82starrfield et  al . ( 1972 ) ; sparks , starrfield , & truran ( 1976 ) ; starrfield , truran , & sparks ( 1978 ) ; truran ( 1982 ) ) .",

    "other short - comings include the assumption of spherical accretion with zero entropy , the neglect of magnetic fields , etc .",
    "so the dividing line between steady hydrogen burning and nova eruptions might leave some room for sn ia progenitors .",

    "the strong wind stabilizes the mass transfer and limits the accretion rate and the white dwarf can burn hydrogen steadily .",
    "however , their model assumes spherical accretion onto and a spherical wind from the white dwarf which seem to be contradicting assumptions .",
    "but the idea should certainly be followed up .      in what follows",
    "we will assume most of the time that sn ia progenitors are chandrasekhar - mass c+o white dwarfs because , as was discussed in the previous sections , this class of models seems to fit best the `` typical '' or `` average '' type ia .",
    "in this subsection we also will not discuss models in which two degenerate white dwarfs merge and form a critical mass for the ignition of carbon , mainly because the merging process will , in reality , be very complex and it is difficult to construct realistic explosion models ( although with increasing computational resources it may be possible in the future ) .",
    "but even if we consider only chandrasekhar - mass white dwarfs as progenitor candidates the information that is needed in order to model the explosion can not be obtained easily .",
    "in particular , the thermal structure and the chemical composition are very uncertain . the c / o - ratio , for example , has to be know throughout the white dwarf , but this ratio depends on the main sequence mass of its progenitor and the metallicity of the gas from which it formed unke99,wl99(umeda et  al .",

    "it was found that , depending on the main sequence mass , the central c / o can vary from 0.4 to 0.6 , considerably less than assumed in most supernova models .",
    "next , the thermal structure of a white dwarf on its way to an explosion depends on the ( convective ) urca - process pa73,i78,i82,bw90,m96(paczynski 1973 ; iben 1978 , 1982 ; barkat & wheeler 1990 ; mochkovitch 1996 ) .",

    "the abundances of the urca - pairs depends again on the initial metallicity which could , thus , affect the thermal structure of the white dwarf .",
    "unfortunately , the convection in the degenerate star is likely to be non - local , time - dependent , 3-dimensional , and very sub - sonic , but needs to be modeled over very long ( secular ) time - scales .",
