    "strongly disordered superconductors near quantum phase transition qpt ) into an insulator state became again an object of great interest during last decade , both on experimental side  @xcite and among theorists  @xcite ( references given above are certainly incomplete , due to a large number of papers in the field ) . on experimental side , revival of the interest to this subject comes about due to new methods which became available . in particular , low - temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy makes it possible to study properties of superconducting state locally with a nanometer - scale resolution , which allowed to demonstrate  @xcite an existence of a strong density - of - states ( dos ) suppression at temperatures much above the superconducting transition @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , amorphous ino@xmath7 films demonstrate virtually zero dos at and around fermi level at @xmath8 .",
    "such a phenomenon was called _ pseudogap _ , in analogy to the somewhat similar phenomenon known for under - doped high-@xmath6 oxide superconductors .",
    "experimentally , clear distinction between single - particle gap ( pseudo - gap ) @xmath1 and collective superconducting gap @xmath5 was made by means of andreev contact spectroscopy  @xcite of the same ino@xmath7 films .    theoretically , it became possible to understand  @xcite the origin of a pseudogap as a result of an effective ( phonon - mediated ) electron - electron attraction acting between anderson - localized electrons .",
    "a detailed semi - quantitative theory of superconductivity , starting from bcs - like model with localized single - electron states ( near 3d anderson localization transition ) was developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , elaborating an approach proposed originally in @xcite and developed numerically in  @xcite .",
    "qualitatively similar results were later obtained  @xcite by means of renormalization group methods developed for 2d systems .",
    "application of ideas developed in  @xcite was found to be useful  @xcite to the understanding of unusual scaling of superconducting density versus superconducting gap , @xmath9 , as reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "a microwave absorption technique used in @xcite may present an alternative to andreev spectroscopy  @xcite for measurement of the genuine superconducting gap .",
    "the present paper is devoted to development of a theory of still another phenomenon that is directly related to the collective superconducting gap in disordered materials at very low temperatures near sit .",
    "namely , we consider attenuation rate @xmath10 of ultrasound wave propagating in a superconducting material with a well developed pseudogap @xmath11 , at the temperature range @xmath12 and at relatively low frequencies @xmath13 ( below the boltzmann s constant @xmath14 is set to unity ) . in the paper  @xcite",
    "we have shown that ultrasound attenuation rate is intrinsically related to the electron - phonon inelastic energy exchange , which becomes very inefficient at sub - kelvin temperatures , leading to thermal instabilities and electron overheating  @xcite in a `` neighbouring '' insulating state of the same ( or similar ) materials  @xcite .",
    "we identified in ref .",
    "@xcite a few mechanisms leading to ( possibly strong ) enhancement of the electron - phonon inelastic coupling due to the presence of slowly diffusing modes which may exist in an electronic liquid ( particle density , magnetization density , etc . ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have studied one more example of such a diffusion - controlled enhancement , now due to diffusion of thermal energy .",
    "this mechanism is quite universally present in any disordered conductor , while its relative strength ( with respect to the standard local pippard mechanism  @xcite ) may vary a lot .",
    "in particular , we have calculated  @xcite ultrasound attenuation @xmath10 for both s - wave and d - wave bcs - type superconducting states ( as well as in normal doped silicon ) ; in the s - wave case both pippard s and diffusion - controlled mechanisms provide an exponentially suppressed low - temperature attenuation @xmath15 , differing in preexponential factors .    for a pseudogapped superconductor with large single - particle gap @xmath1 , all _ local _ inelastic electron - phonon processes",
    "are obviously suppressed @xmath16 , while ultrasound attenuation due to energy diffusion mode are expected to contain exponential factors @xmath17 , with smaller collective gap @xmath5 .",
    "thus it is natural to expect that low - temperature behavior of @xmath10 will be controlled by this latter mechanism .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to calculate @xmath10 within the simplest model of a pseudogapped superconductor .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sec.ii we formulate our basic model for a superconductor with a large pseudogap and discuss its basic properties , sec .",
    "iii is devoted to the derivation of the form of collective modes present in the superconducting state , then in sec .",
    "iv we introduce simplest model of electron - phonon coupling relevant for the pseudogapped superconductor .",
    "v contains derivation of our main results : ultrasonic attenuation rate @xmath10 due to coupling between phonons and two collective superconducting modes ( phase and amplitude modes ) is derived .",
    "vi is devoted to a discussion of the role of long - range coulomb interaction between electron pairs .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "vi contains our conclusions .",
    "according to the analysis developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , pseudogapped superconducting state can be realized in poor conductors where single - particle electron states are weakly localized ( localization length @xmath18 is larger than mean distance between electrons which eventually participate in superconductivity ) , and effective cooper attraction is present between electrons . for the last condition to be realized together with sufficient disorder needed for localization , coulomb repulsion between conduction electrons should be strongly suppressed .",
    "this is the reason to start from the simplest model formulated in terms of `` pseudo - spins '' @xmath19 introduced originally by p.w.anderson in  @xcite : @xmath20=-2\\sum_{i=1}^{n } \\xi_is_i^z-\\sum_{i > j=1}^{n}j_{ij}{\\left[}s_i^xs_j^x+s_i^ys_j^y{\\right]},\\ ] ] here @xmath21 and @xmath22 are operators which create ( annihilate ) a pair of electrons populating @xmath23-th localized eigenstate of the free - electron problem , while @xmath24 counts the number of these pairs .",
    "each localized eigenstate can be characterized by location of its maxima and by its eigenvalue @xmath25 .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath26 is a local energy of a cooper pair siting on a `` site '' @xmath23 . for simplicity , we assume sites @xmath23 to be arranged into cubic lattice with an elementary cell of size @xmath27",
    ". hamiltonian ( [ h0 ] ) acts in the reduced hilbert space , spanned by localized electron pairs with zero total spin ; single - electron population of any localized state is excluded , due to high extra energy @xmath11 associated with it ( parity gap , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    magnitudes of @xmath25 are random with a distribution function @xmath28 .",
    "we assume a box - shaped @xmath29 with energies in the interval @xmath30 , although any distribution which is flat around fermi energy position will lead to the same physical results",
    ". then effective density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level is given by @xmath31 .",
    "the second term of eq.([h0 ] ) describes hopping of cooper pairs between the orbitals , that is equivalent to interaction between pseudospins . in the long - wavelength limit",
    "this ( fourier - transformed ) interaction can be expanded in powers of small momenta @xmath32 , @xmath33,\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the overall coupling strength and @xmath35 can be interpreted as a typical interaction range ( i.e. cooper pair hopping range ) . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , we expect @xmath35 to be somewhat larger than @xmath18",
    ". the hamiltonian ( [ h0 ] ) does not contain any remnants of long - range coulomb repulsion between electrons ; this is an idealized model which we are going to start from .",
    "we will discuss the role of ( weak ) coulomb repulsion in the end of the paper .",
    "the same hamiltonian ( [ h0 ] ) was employed in the paper  @xcite to study quantum phase transition ( qpt ) between superconducting state ( in spin terms , it is the state with nonzero average @xmath36 ) and insulating state . in the present paper",
    "we will not consider specific features related to this qpt ; instead , we are interested in the properties of collective excitations within well - developed superconducting state .",
    "this is why we choose to work here with the model of very large interaction ( hopping ) range @xmath37 , and we will employ further a mean - field approximation based on this inequility . in this sense ,",
    "our approach is similar to the usual semiclassical theory of superconductivity .    on a technical side ,",
    "we choose fedotov - popov representation  @xcite for spin-@xmath38 operators , that is useful to construct a diagrammatic approach and to study collective modes in the ordered state .",
    "it is shown in paper  @xcite ( see also some extension of this approach in  @xcite ) that exact representation of the partition function for interacting spin systems can be obtained by the representation of spin operators via a special kind of fermionic operators : @xmath39 where @xmath40 are three pauli matrices and ( anticommuting ) two - component spinor operators @xmath41 obey the following boundary condition in the matsubara imaginary time : @xmath42 , @xmath43,where @xmath44 . following  @xcite , we will refer to such a modified fermions as to `` semions '' .",
    "using representation ( [ fp ] ) , we rewrite the original hamiltonian in the form @xmath45 where in the interaction term the index @xmath46 . to treat the interaction term , we introduce a complex order parameter field @xmath5 via hubbard - stratonovich transformation and integrate out semions .",
