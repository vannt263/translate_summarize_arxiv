    "over the last two decades much attention has been focused on the properties of the dissipative variants of the jaynes - cummings model ( jcm ) .",
    "the theoretical efforts has been stimulated by experimental progress in investigation of the interaction of a single atom with electromagnetic field inside the cavity @xcite .",
    "the experiments with highly excited rydberg atoms allowed some of the predictions of the extended version of jcm to be proved . besides the experimental drive",
    ", there also exists a theoretical motivation to include relevant damping mechanism to jcm because its dynamics becomes more interesting .",
    "the dissipative effects in jcm caused by the energy exchange between the system and environment have been studied both analytically @xcite-@xcite and numerically @xcite-@xcite .",
    "last few years the jcm with phase damping , as applied to decoherence and entanglement , has been also treated intensively @xcite .",
    "it s known that two - photon processes are very important in atomic systems due to high degree of correlation between the emitted photons .",
    "hence , one valuable extension of the jcm is well - known two - photon jcm . with the experimental realization of two - photon micromaser @xcite",
    "the dissipative two - photon jcm has attracted a great deal of attention @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it is worth nothing that in all mentioned works the dissipative dynamics of the degenerate two - photon jcm has been under consideration . in order to advance one step further in the investigation of two - photon processes , the jcm with two - mode two - photon interaction or nondegenerate two - photon jcm ( ntpjcm )",
    "were proposed .",
    "a remarkable feature of such a model is that one mode can be used to affect on the other mode .",
    "the lossless ntpjcm has been used to study time evolution of the atomic and photon operators , the second - order coherence function , the one- and two - mode squeezing , the atomic dipole squeezing , the emission spectra and quantum entropy and entanglement without and with consideration of stark - shifts @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the influence of phase damping on nonclassical properties of ntpjcm has been considered in @xcite .",
    "the effect of a cavity damping on the time behaviour of the atomic population in the special case when the fields are initially in the two - mode squeezed vacuum has been taken investigated by gou @xcite .",
    "it s of great interest to investigate the role of energy dissipation in dynamics of the ntpjcm for arbitrary fields states .",
    "the nondegenerate two - photon jaynes - cummings model is an effective two - level atom with upper and lover states denoted @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively interacting with two modes of quantum electromagnetic field with frequencies @xmath2 and @xmath3 through two - photon transition .",
    "the hamiltonian for such a system in dipole and rwa approximation is    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the atomic transition frequency , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the cavity mode frequencies , @xmath6 @xmath7 are the creation ( annihilation ) operator of the photon ( @xmath8 ) , @xmath9 is the inversion population operator , @xmath10 are the operators describing the transitions between the upper and lower levels and @xmath11 is the atom - field coupling constant .",
    "we have ignored the stark shift caused by the intermediate level and denoted the detuning parameter as @xmath12 which satisfy the condition @xmath13 .    in order to describe dissipation one has to treat the system as open . in this paper",
    "we take into account only the field mode damping and ignore the atom damping .",
    "the cavity is assumed to be at zero temperature .",
    "then , the master equation for the density matrix of combined ( atom - field ) system is    @xmath14   - \\sum_{i=1}^2 k_i\\left ( a_i^+ a_i\\rho - 2\\,a_i\\rho\\,a_i^+ + \\rho\\,a_i^+ a_i \\right ) , \\ ] ]    where @xmath15 are the rates of photon leakage from the cavity . for the sake of simplicity we put @xmath16 .    using the representation @xmath17 where @xmath18 is an arbitrary operator of combined system ,",
    "one can rewrite the master equation ( 2 ) in the form @xmath19    to solve eq.(3 ) we have used the so - called dressed - states representation , i.e. representation consisting of the complete set of hamiltonian eigenstates . for lossless cavity the full set of dressed states are @xmath20 with eigenvalues @xmath21 where @xmath22 @xmath23 here @xmath24 refers to a state with @xmath25 photons in the cavity field mode and the atom in the excited ( @xmath26 ) or in the ground ( @xmath27 ) state @xmath28 where @xmath29 .    for finite - q cavity the above states ( 4 )",
    "should be added with the states : @xmath30 , @xmath31 ,    @xmath32 , @xmath33 ,    @xmath34 , @xmath35 which take into account the photon leakage with no atom change .    using the secular approximation which holds for @xmath36 @xcite ,",
    "i.e. neglecting the oscillatory terms , the equations for the diagonal elements of density matrix @xmath37 are found to be @xmath38 @xmath39 ^ 2 \\langle \\psi^\\pm_{n_1 + 1,n_2}|w|\\psi^\\pm_{n_1 + 1,n_2}\\rangle-\\]]@xmath40 ^ 2 \\langle \\psi^\\mp_{n_1 + 1,n_2}|w|\\psi^\\mp_{n_1 + 1,n_2}\\rangle-\\ ] ] @xmath41 ^ 2 \\langle \\psi^\\pm_{n_1,n_2 + 1}|w|\\psi^\\pm_{n_1,n_2 + 1}\\rangle-\\ ] ] @xmath42 ^ 2 \\langle \\psi^\\mp_{n_1,n_2 + 1}|w|\\psi^\\mp_{n_1,n_2 + 1}\\rangle,\\phantom{-}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 and @xmath44    the equations for off - diagonal elements of @xmath37 with nonzero right - hand sides are @xmath45 the solutions of equations ( 8) are @xmath46 and the solutions of equations ( 5)-(7 ) may be obtained only numerically . for this purpose one can assumed that initially there is an upper limit on the number of photons @xmath47 and @xmath48 in both of cavity modes so that @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",
    "this implies that these matrix elements are zero for all @xmath51 since the cavity can not add to the photon numbers .",
    "then , one can start with @xmath52 and @xmath53 and iterate equations ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) for smaller values of photon numbers untill @xmath54 .",
    "if there is no upper limit on the initial numbers of photons in the system the numbers @xmath47 and @xmath48 must be taken large enough for the mean values of observables to calculate with the appropriate accuracy .",
    "these quantities may be obtained in the standard manner @xmath55    the solutions of the eqs .",
    "( 5)-(7 ) for arbitrary initial states of atom and field can result from numerical calculations .",
    "we consider below the ntpjcm with the atom initially in the excite state and the fields in coherent states .",
    "the initial density matrix @xmath56 for atom in the excited state and the fields in the coherent states is @xmath57 where @xmath58    first consider the time behaviour of mean photon numbers and mean atomic populations @xmath59 + the mean populations of the excited atomic state in the presence of the two modes of coherent state are plotted in figs . 1 - 4 for various values of @xmath60 @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "for small values of @xmath62 and @xmath63 the phenomena of quantum revivals and quantum collapses of the rabi oscillation appear .",
    "they are not as regular as those in one - photon or degenerate two - photon case .",
    "it can be seen that the amplitudes of the revival oscillations decrease as a consequence of the cavity damping and detuning . in the case of strong damping ,",
    "the cavity losses are so large that no collapses or revivals phenomena may appear . as a result of the computer simulations",
    "it can be said that the decay time and serene duration time for atomic populations are directly affected by the initial photon numbers in the cavity modes .",
    "the serene duration time decreases as @xmath60 @xmath61 decreases and mean populations manifests the more fluctuating behaviour . for large field intensities",
    "the detuning influences both revival amplitudes and serene duration time , as well as quasi - stationary atomic population value .",
    "since two photons are absorbed and/or emitted by the atom simultaneously in the cavity , one can tell that the behavior of photon numbers of mode 2 shows the exactly same manner as for the mode 1 .",
    "therefore in figs.5 -8 we have plotted the mean photon number for first cavity mode .",
    "the mean photon numbers exhibit the same pattern of collapse and revival as the atomic population .",
    "a comparison of figs .",
    "1 - 8 shows that the photon numbers more significantly affected by cavity damping than the atomic population . in the case of strong damping or detuning",
    "the mean photon number decays exponentially .",
    "perhaps a better appreciation of the statistics can be had by examining second - order correlation function @xmath64 as a function of time t. the second - order correlation functions for two cavity fields may be defined as @xmath65 for strictly coherent field @xmath66 whereas negative values of @xmath64 lead to the antibunching of the field . in dressed - state representation",
    "the second - order correlation function becomes @xmath67    in figs .",
    "9 and 10 we plot @xmath68 for different detuning and damping parameters and large initial field intensities . for undamped resonant cavity collapses and revivals appear . in the case of collapse in the absence of detuning ( or cavity damping ) , @xmath69 , the oscillations show both bunching and antibunching features . in the cases of nonzero",
    "damping and detuning the antibunching effects almost disappear .",
    "the amplitudes of the revivals oscillations will be damped by small cavity losses to the extent that antibunching appears only at the very beginning of the time evolution . for large detuning the second - order correlation function @xmath70 for every @xmath51 .",
    "finally , we study the field and atomic squeezing . in order to investigate the squeezing properties of the radiation field we define the slowly varying hermitian quadrature operators for fields @xmath71 @xmath72",

    "the variances @xmath77 satisfy the uncertainty relation @xmath78 . for the vacuum and coherent states of the field the variances are equal 1/4 .",
