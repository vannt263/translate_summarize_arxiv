    "a precise determination of all cp violating angles  @xcite is one of the major goals of the current and future b physics experiments .",
    "the measured values of these angles may be consistent with the standard model ( sm ) predictions , or they may indicate the presence of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "early indications are that new physics , if present , is likely to have rather small effects on the angles of the unitarity triangle .",
    "hence , to uncover any new physics , it is extremely important that all the cp violating angles be determined without theoretical uncertainties .    in the early days of the field",
    ", it was thought that the cp angles could be easily measured in @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , and @xmath12 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "however , it soon became clear that things would not be so easy : the presence of penguin amplitudes  @xcite makes the extraction of @xmath9 from @xmath8 quite difficult , and completely spoil the measurement of @xmath7 in @xmath13 .",
    "in fact , determining @xmath7 through techniques which are theoretically clean as well as experimentally feasible has been a challenge .",
    "the problem of penguin pollution can be avoided by considering decay modes that involve only tree amplitudes . in this",
    "talk we first indicate the practical problems encountered by most of the clean methods to determine @xmath7 , using pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar ( pp ) and pseudoscalar - vector ( pv ) final states and involving only tree amplitudes .",
    "we next demonstrate , how the use of the corresponding vector - vector ( vv ) final state modes , resolves these problems .",
    "the rich kinematics of the vv modes accessible via an angular analysis , provides a large number of observables which allows clean extraction of cp phases .    as a first example",
    ", we consider the pp or pv final states , @xmath14 .",
    "both @xmath15 and @xmath16 can decay to these final states and only one weak amplitude contributes .",
    "hence , the amplitudes for these decay modes may be written as , [ amp1 ] aamp ( b^0 f ) & = & a e^i^a e^i_a  , + aamp ( f ) & = & b e^i^b e^i_b  .",
    "where , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "because of @xmath15@xmath16 mixing , cp violation comes about due to an interference between the amplitudes @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "note that since both @xmath15 and @xmath16 can also decay to @xmath21 , one can measure the four time dependent decay rates , @xmath22 ,  @xmath23 ,  @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "it is therefore possible to determine the weak phase @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "however , the decay amplitude , @xmath27 and hence , the decay rate for @xmath28 is expected to be small .",
    "the ratio , @xmath29 , is essentially @xmath30 .",
    "obviously , it will be very difficult to measure this tiny quantity with any precision , and therefore it would not be viable to carry out this method in practice . on the other hand , we will demonstrate that with the corresponding vv final states ( @xmath31 ) , one can extract @xmath1 using an angular analysis , without the knowledge of the smaller amplitude  @xcite .",
    "the second example that we examine , is that of direct cp violation , in the modes : @xmath32 , @xmath33 . in this method",
    "@xcite , @xmath7 is obtained from an interference of the mode @xmath34 with @xmath35 , which occurs if and only if , both @xmath36 and @xmath37 decay to a common final state @xmath38 ; in particular , @xmath38 is taken to be a @xmath39 eigenstate .",
    "this technique of extracting @xmath7 requires a measurement of the branching ratio for @xmath40 which is not experimentally feasible as pointed out in  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the @xmath39 violating asymmetries tend to be small as the interfering amplitudes are not comparable .",
    "the use of non@xmath39 eigenstates ` @xmath38 ' has also been considered  @xcite in literature .",
    "atwood , dunietz and soni ( ads )  @xcite extended this proposal by considering ` @xmath38 ' to be non@xmath39 eigenstates that are also doubly cabbibo suppressed modes of @xmath41 .",
    "the two interfering amplitudes then are of the same magnitude resulting in large asymmetries .",
    "their proposal is to use two final states @xmath42 and @xmath43 with at least one being a non@xmath39 eigenstate .",
    "the use of more than one final state enables not only the determination of @xmath7 , but also of all the strong phases involved and the difficult to measure branching ratio @xmath44 . however , an input into the determination of @xmath7 is the branching ratio of the doubly cabbibo suppressed mode of @xmath41 .",
    "here again , the vv final states , provide an alternative  @xcite . ( some other plausible methods have also been recently proposed  @xcite . )",
    "the vv modes @xmath45 , @xmath46 , enable extraction of @xmath7 and all the unknowns involved , including the br for doubly cabibbo - suppressed mode of @xmath41 .",
    "the most general covariant amplitude for a @xmath0 meson decaying to a pair of vector mesons has the form  @xcite @xmath47   \\left (   a\\ ; g_{\\mu\\nu}+   \\frac{b}{m_1 m_2 } p_{\\mu } p_{\\nu }   + i\\frac{c}{m_1 m_2 }   \\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\alpha\\beta } k^\\alpha q^\\beta   \\right)~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , @xmath51 represent the polarization vectors and the masses of the vector mesons @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively .",
    "the coefficients @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 can be expressed in terms of the linear polarization basis @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 as follows : @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "if both mesons subsequently decay into two @xmath62 mesons , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath63 and @xmath64 , the amplitude can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66(@xmath67 ) is the angle between the @xmath68(@xmath69 ) three - momentum vector , @xmath70 in the @xmath71 rest frame and the direction of total @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) three - momentum vector defined in the @xmath0 rest frame .",
    "@xmath72 is the angle between the normals to the planes defined by @xmath73 and @xmath74 , in the @xmath0 rest frame .",
    "we consider a final state @xmath38 , consisting of two vector mesons , to which both @xmath15 and @xmath16 can decay . if only one weak amplitude contributes to @xmath19 and @xmath76 , we can write the helicity amplitudes as follows : @xmath77 where the helicity index @xmath78 takes the values @xmath79 . in the above , @xmath80 and @xmath81",

    ", one can measure the 18 observables @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 . in terms of the helicity",

    "the expressions for these another 18 observables , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 are similar to those given in eq .",
    "( [ defs ] ) , with the replacements @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "angular analysis is more powerful than previously realized . due to the interference between the different helicity states",
    ", there are enough independent measurement that one can obtain weak phase information as we now show .",
    "first , we note that _ = |_= ,  _ = -|_= .",
    "[ lamsig_eq ] thus , one can determine the magnitudes of the amplitudes appearing in eqs .",
    "( [ amp1])([amp4 ] ) , @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "however , it must be stressed that _ the knowledge of @xmath100 will not be necessary within our method_.    next , we have @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 . using eq .",
    "( [ ls ] ) one can solve for @xmath104 .",
    "we will see that this is the only combination needed to cleanly extract weak phase information .",
    "the coefficients of the @xmath105 term , which can be obtained in a time - dependent study , can be written as _ = a_b_(+ _ ) ,     for @xmath106 , and negative for @xmath107 . in the above",
    ", we have defined the cp phase @xmath108 .",
    "these quantities can be used to determine 2 b _",
    "_ = ,   2 b__= .",
    "[ delta ] similarly , the terms involving interference of different helicities are given as @xmath109      note that this method relies on the measurement of the interference terms between different helicities .",
    "however , we do not actually require that all three helicity components of the amplitude be used .",
    "in fact , one can use observables involving any two of largest helicity amplitudes . in the above description",
    ", one could have chosen ` @xmath116 ' instead of ` @xmath117 ' or ` @xmath118 ' .",
    "we now turn to specific applications of this method .",
    "consider first the final states where , @xmath119 . in this case , the parameters of eqs .",
    "( [ amp1])([amp4 ] ) satisfy @xmath120 , @xmath121 ( which implies that @xmath122 ) , and @xmath123 ( so that @xmath124 ) .",
    "as described above , @xmath99 can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ lamsig_eq ] ) .",
    "but now the measurement of @xmath125 [ eq .  ( [ rho_eq ] ) ] directly yields @xmath126 .",
    "in fact , this is the conventional way  @xcite of using the angular analysis to measure the weak phases : each helicity state separately gives clean cp - phase information .",
    "thus , for such states , nothing is gained by including the interference terms .    in order to have final states with only one weak amplitude , we consider states that do not receive penguin contributions .",
    "the only such cabibbo - allowed quark - level decays are @xmath127 .",
    "the meson level examples of these are @xmath128 .",
    "these are the vv counterparts of the pp / pv modes described in first example of section  [ first ] . as we have already emphasized in the discussion following eq .",
    "( [ lamsig_eq ] ) , _ none of the observables or combinations required for the analysis to extract @xmath129 are proportional to @xmath100_. thus , we avoid the practical problems present in dunietz s method  @xcite .",
    "the two decay amplitudes for the final states @xmath31 have very different sizes , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath130 .",
    "this results in a very small cp - violating asymmetry whose size is approximately @xmath131 .",
    "thankfully , the situation is alleviated by the large branching ratio for the decay @xmath132 , roughly 1% .",
    "the cabibbo - suppressed quark - level decays which do not receive penguin contributions are @xmath133 , at meson level these would correspond to @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 , @xmath137 , with @xmath138 and @xmath139 decaying to @xmath140 . however , in these modes one has the old problem of taggig the neutral @xmath141  @xcite .",
    "one can also consider @xmath142 and @xmath143 decays .",
    "corresponding to the quark - level decays @xmath144 , or @xmath145 .",
    "the most promising processes are the cabibbo - suppressed decay modes @xmath146 . here",
    "the @xmath147 mixing phase is almost @xmath148 , so that the quantity @xmath5 can be extracted from the angular analysis of @xmath149 .",
    "other methods for obtaining the cp phase @xmath7 using similar final states have also been studied  @xcite .",
    "it is _ also possible to cleanly extract the weak phase @xmath7 using only charged @xmath150 decays , _ by studying the angular distribution  @xcite .",
    "the decays @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 , @xmath154 can be related by cpt .",
    "consider @xmath155 decaying into @xmath156 , with @xmath157 meson further decaying to a final state ` @xmath38 ' that is common to both @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 is chosen to be a cabibbo - allowed mode of @xmath36 or a doubly - suppressed mode of @xmath37 .",
    "the amplitudes for the decays of @xmath158 and @xmath159 to a final state involving @xmath38 will be a sum of the contributions from @xmath160 and @xmath161 , and similarly for the cp - conjugate processes . in this case",
    "one can experimentally measure the magnitudes of the 12 helicity amplitudes , as well as the interference terms , leading to a total of 24 independent observables .",
    "however , there are just 15 unknowns involved in the amplitudes : @xmath162 ; where , @xmath163 and @xmath164 is the strong phase difference between @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "hence , the weak phase @xmath7 may be cleanly extracted .",
    "in addition , this technique has some interesting features :    * the signals of cp violation can be obtained by adding @xmath0 and @xmath167 events , i.e , flavour tagging is not required . * the cp violation signals are not diluted by the sine of strong phases .",
    "we have presented new methods , that use angular analysis in @xmath168 decay modes , to cleanly extract weak phases .",
    "using modes which do not receive penguin contributions , the weak phases @xmath169 and @xmath7 can be determined .",
    "we have shown that the quantity @xmath170 can be cleanly obtained from the time dependent angular analysis study of the decays @xmath2 , @xmath3 etc .",
    "similarly , @xmath5 can be cleanly extracted from @xmath4 , or simply from an angular analysis of the decay mode @xmath171 .",
    "the large number of data samples already collected for the @xmath172 mode  @xcite , may enable , @xmath173 to be the second clean measurement , after @xmath174 , to be performed at @xmath0-factories .",
