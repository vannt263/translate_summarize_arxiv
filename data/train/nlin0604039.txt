    "the identification of dromions which are exponentially decaying solutions in the davey - stewartson i and other equations [ 1 - 6 ] has triggered a renewed interest in the study of integrable models in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "dromions arise essentially by virtue of coupling the field variable to a mean field / potential , thereby preventing wave collapse in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions and they can in general undergo inelastic collision unlike one dimensional solitons .",
    "the identification of a large number of arbitrary functions in the solutions of ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional integrable models has only added to the richness in the structure of them and hence construction of localized excitations in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions continues to be a challenging and rewarding contemporary problem .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the existence of localized structures in the long wave short wave resonance interaction equation of the form @xmath0 [ i ] where the fields @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote short surface wave packets and long interfacial waves respectively , while @xmath3 stands for complex conjugation . the above equation has been recently studied [ 7,8 ] and its positon and one dromion solutions have been generated through hirota method .",
    "however , no further general solutions could be constructed through this procedure for equations ( [ i ] ) . in this contribution",
    ", we develop a very simple and straightforward procedure to generate a rather extended class of generic solutions of physical interest . for this purpose , first we carry out the singularity structure analysis to the lsri equation and confirm its painlev nature .",
    "we utilize the local laurent expansion of the general solution and truncate it at the constant level term ( painlev truncation approach ) and obtain solutions in terms of arbitrary functions . through this procedure",
    "we generate various periodic and exponentially localized solutions to equation ( [ i ] ) .",
    "the novelty here is that the solution is generated through a very simple procedure but the solution obtained is rich in structure because of the arbitrary functions [ 9 - 14 ] present in the solution .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present the singularity structure analysis of the lsri equation . using these results , in section 3",
    ", we have shown the construction of solutions for the lsri equation through painlev truncation approach .",
    "section 4 contains a wide class of localized solutions of the lsri equation both periodic and exponentially localized ones , through judicial choice of the arbitrary functions . in section 5 ,",
    "we summarize our results .",
    "the appendix contains the one dromion solution of lsri equation obtained through hirota bilinearization approach for comparison .",
    "to explore the singularity structure of equation ( [ i ] ) , we rewrite @xmath1=q and @xmath4=r to obtain the following set of coupled equations , @xmath5 [ s1 ] we now effect a local laurent expansion in the neighbourhood of a noncharacteristic singular manifold @xmath6=0 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 . assuming the leading orders of the solutions of equation ( [ s1 ] ) to have the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are analytic functions of ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) and @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 are integers to be determined , we substitute ( [ s2 ] ) into ( [ s1 ] ) and balance the most dominant terms to obtain @xmath19 with the condition @xmath20 now , considering the generalized laurent expansion of the solutions in the neighbourhood of the singular manifold , @xmath21 [ eq6 ] the resonances which are the powers at which arbitrary functions enter into ( 6 ) can be determined by substituting ( 6 ) into ( [ s1 ] ) . vanishing of the coefficients of ( @xmath22,@xmath22,@xmath22 ) lead to the condition @xmath23 from equation ( [ s4 ] ) , one gets the resonance values as @xmath24 the resonance at @xmath25 = -1 naturally represents the arbitrariness of the manifold @xmath26 . in order to prove the existence of arbitrary functions at the other resonance values , we now substitute the full laurent series @xmath27 [ s13 ] into equation ( [ s1 ] ) . now collecting the coefficients of ( @xmath28 , @xmath28 , @xmath28 ) and solving the resultant equation , we obtain equation ( [ s6 ] ) , implying the existence of a resonance at @xmath29 .    similarly collecting the coefficients of ( @xmath30 , @xmath30 , @xmath30 ) and solving the resultant equations by using the kruskal s ansatz , @xmath31 , we get @xmath32,\\\\ r_{1}=\\frac{1}{2}[-ir_{0}(\\psi_{t}+\\psi_{y})-2r_{0x } ] , \\label{s14 } \\\\ l_{1}=0 .",

    "obviously @xmath41 itself can be obtained either from ( [ s7 ] ) or ( [ s8 ] ) .",

    "then , we are left with two equations for three unknowns .",
    "so , one of the three coefficients @xmath45 , @xmath46 or @xmath47 is arbitrary .",

    "thus , the lsri equation indeed satisfies the painlev property .",

    "now we make use of the above truncated laurent expansion solution to obtain exact solutions of the lsri equation ( [ i ] ) for the variables @xmath89 and @xmath90 .    taking into account our notation in equation ( [ s1 ] ) , that is @xmath91 and @xmath92",
    ", we have @xmath93 as far as equation ( [ i ] ) is concerned . using this condition in equations ( [ p17 ] ) and ( [ p18 ] )",

    "let us now choose the arbitrary functions @xmath97 and @xmath98 to be jacobian elliptic functions , namely @xmath99 or @xmath100 functions .",
    "the motivation behind this choice of arbitrary function stems from the fact that the limiting forms of these functions happen to be localized functions .",
    "hence , a choice of @xmath100 and @xmath99 functions can yield periodic solutions which are more general than exponentially localized solutions ( dromions ) .",
    "we choose , for example , @xmath101 so that @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 . in equations ( [ l1 ] ) and ( [ l1_2 ] ) ,",
    "the quantities @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the modulus parameters of the respective jacobian elliptic functions while @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 are arbitrary constants .",
    "the corresponding expression for @xmath111 takes the form @xmath112 the profile of the above solution for the parametric choice @xmath107=@xmath108 = 1 , @xmath109=@xmath110=0 , @xmath105= 0.2 , @xmath106 = 0.3 , @xmath15=0 is shown in figure 1(a ) .",
    "note that the periodic wave moves with unit phase velocity .      as a limiting case of the periodic solution given by equation ( [ q ] ) , when @xmath105 , @xmath106 @xmath113 1 , the above solution degenerates into an exponentially localized solution ( dromion ) .",
    "noting that @xmath114 and @xmath115 , the limiting forms corresponding to ( 1,1 ) dromion take the expressions @xmath116 and @xmath117 the variable @xmath2 then takes the form ( using expression ( [ p19 ] ) ) @xmath118 schematic form of the ( 1,1 ) dromion for the parametric choice @xmath107=@xmath108=1 , @xmath109=@xmath110=0 is shown in figure 1(b ) .",
    "again note that the dromion travels with unit velocity in a diagonal direction in the @xmath119 plane .",
    "one can check that the ( 1,1 ) dromion obtained by lai and chow in reference 8 using the hirota s bilinear method is a special case of the above solution ( [ l3_1 ] ) by fixing the parameters @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 suitably .",
    "however the later method is unable to give more general solutions ( see also appendix a ) .",
    "next we obtain more general periodic solution by choosing further general forms for the arbitrary functions . as an example , we choose @xmath120 where @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 are arbitrary constants and @xmath125 s are modulus parameters ( @xmath126 ) .",

    "the dromion interaction for the parametric choice @xmath134=@xmath135=@xmath136 = 1 , @xmath137 = -1 , @xmath138=0.5 , @xmath139=@xmath140=1 , @xmath109=@xmath110=@xmath141=0 is shown in figures 2b-2d for different time intervals . here",
    "both the dromions travel with equal velocity but along opposite diagonals in the @xmath119 plane .",
    "the interaction is elastic for this choice .",
    "the variable @xmath2 can be evaluated again using equation ( 31 ) , which we desist from presenting here .",
    "another example for more general periodic solution is given by choosing @xmath144 in equation ( [ l4_3 ] ) , we choose @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath142 @xmath113 1 , to obtain ( 2,2 ) dromion solution given by @xmath145 where @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath146 .",
    "the solution of ( 2,2 ) dromion for the parametric choice @xmath134=@xmath135=@xmath136 = @xmath137 = 1 , @xmath138=0.5 , @xmath139=@xmath140=@xmath147=1 , @xmath109=@xmath110=@xmath141=@xmath148=0 is plotted in figure 3 for various time intervals .",
    "we find that there are two sets of dromions , each set containing two dromions one followed by the other .",
    "the two sets of dromions are travelling with same velocity in opposite diagonals of the x - y plane .",
    "the dromions interact and move forward as time progresses .      to generalize the above solutions , we choose @xmath149 where @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 are arbitrary constants and all @xmath156 s and @xmath157 s take values between 0 to 1 for periodic solutions and equal to 1 for dromion solutions .",
    "we proceed as above to construct periodic and dromion solutions respectively as @xmath158 and @xmath159 where @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "another type of elliptic function solution can be chosen as @xmath162 then @xmath163 where @xmath164 , @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",

    "we can see that the instanton expressed by ( [ l2_2 ] ) , has maximum amplitude at @xmath169 while the amplitude decays exponentially as time @xmath170 .      a more general form of ( [ l2_1 ] ) is given by @xmath171 then @xmath172 here @xmath173 @xmath174 @xmath175 , and @xmath133 .",

    "is shown in figures 5b-5f .",
    "choosing the arbitrary constants appropriately , we have one of the instanton having a maximum amplitude at t=-2 while the other at t=2 and decay exponentially as time @xmath170 .    to generalize the above solutions , we choose @xmath180 where @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath181 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 are arbitrary constants , @xmath156 , @xmath182 and @xmath157 take values between 0 and 1 .",
    "one can construct multi - instanton solution by choosing all the values of @xmath156 , @xmath182 and @xmath157 to be equal to 1 .      in the expression ( [ p21 ] ) , one can also easily identify bounded multiple solitary waves all moving with the same velocity .",
    "for instance , using the jacobian elliptic function form ( [ l4_3 ] ) with @xmath183 in the limit @xmath184 , one can obtain multiple solitary waves which are bounded .",
    "figure 6 displays the structure of a two - soliton solution expressed by @xmath185}{[\\tanh\\frac{x+y}3 + 8+\\tanh(t - y+5)+2\\tanh(t - y-5)]^2}\\ ] ] which corresponds to the selections ( see equation ( [ l4_3 ] ) ) @xmath186 the figure shows that one of the solitary wave follows the other one but both are travelling with equal velocity .",
    "hence , there will not be any interaction between them .",
    "finally , one can obtain other interesting classes of solutions for different choices of the arbitrary functions in equations ( [ p20 ] ) , ( [ p21 ] ) and ( [ p19 ] ) .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the singularity structure of the ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional lsri equation and confirmed that it satisfies the painlev property .",
    "the painlev truncation approach has been used to construct successfully a very wide class of solutions of the ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional lsri equation .",
    "the rich solution structure of the lsri equation is revealed because of the entrance of three arbitrary functions in ( 34 ) and ( 31 ) .",
    "especially , jacobian elliptic function periodic wave solutions and three special localized structures , namely dromion , dromion type instanton and bounded dromion solutions are given explicitly .",
    "however , more general multiple non - bounded dromion solutions whose phase velocities differ from each other have not yet been obtained from the present approach .",
    "it appears that one has to solve equation ( 22 ) for more general solutions than the form ( 23 ) presented in this paper in order to deduce more general solution .",
    "this is an open problem at present .",
    "the work of c. s. and m. l. form part of a department of science and technology , govt . of india sponsored research project .",
    "the work of s. y. l. was supported by the national natural science foundations of china ( no .",

    "here we briefly point out how the ( 1,1 ) dromion solution can be obtained through hirota bilinearization method [ 8 ] . to bilinearize equation ( 1 )",
    ", we make the transformation @xmath187 which can be identified from the painlev analysis in sec .",
    "the resultant bilinear form is given by @xmath188 @xmath189 where @xmath190 s are the usual hirota operators . to generate a ( 1,1 ) dromion",
