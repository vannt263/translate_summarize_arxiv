    "such coronal disturbances were dubbed eit or euv waves .",
    "the euv waves generally appear as broad , diffuse features that form a single arc - shaped bright front on euv difference images .",
    "they can propagate over most of the visible solar disk , and are often followed by expanding coronal dimming regions @xcite .",
    "the propagation speeds of the euv waves are typically 200400 km  s@xmath0 @xcite .",

    "significant controversy remains over their physical mechanisms and origins .",
    "since the typical speeds of the euv waves are higher than the quiet - sun coronal sound speed ( @xmath2 200 km  s@xmath0 ) and comparable to the local alfvn speed ( @xmath3 1000 km  s@xmath0@xcite ) , and the euv waves are often associated with flares and cmes , therefore , they were initially interpreted as compressive fast - mode magnetosonic waves ( @xmath4 ) driven by flares or cmes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) in the solar corona @xcite , which have been successfully explained as coronal fast - mode waves sweeping the chromosphere @xcite .",
    "however , many observations demonstrate that the speeds of the euv waves are often smaller than that of the moreton waves . to reconcile this discrepancy",
    ", some authors argue that it can be explained by considering the deceleration of the euv waves @xcite . in h@xmath5 observations , the waves",
    "can only be observed during the early stage of the euv wave .",
    "whereas , in euv observations , they can be traced to much longer distances .",
    "therefore , the speeds measured in h@xmath5 wavelengths are just the initial speeds of the euv waves , which are still of high speeds . if the euv waves propagate with a significant deceleration rate , the velocity discrepancy between the moreton and euv waves should be reasonable @xcite .",
    "a number of observations indicate that the euv waves do show the evidence for the deceleration of an order of several hundred m s@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "other characteristics in terms of a freely propagating fast - mode wave are also identified , such as the broadening of the perturbation profile and decreasing of the perturbation amplitude during the propagation period of the euv waves @xcite .",
    "in addition , some observations show that the euv waves are not always observed simultaneously in h@xmath5 and euv wavelengths , which might be resulted from the low magnetosonic mach numbers of the euv waves @xcite .",
    "with wavelet analysis technique , @xcite showed an euv wave with a well defined period of about 400 s and a minimum energy of @xmath7 j , which is comparable to the energy of a nanoflare . occasionally , the euv waves can occur repeatedly within a short timescale from the same source region @xcite .",
    "for these homologous euv waves , it is propitious to perform a quantitative analysis of the characteristic wave parameters without any limitation like changing or unknown quiet - sun background conditions .",
    "the euv waves have been observed to interact with various coronal magnetic structures ( e.g. , filaments and coronal holes ) along their propagation paths @xcite . @xcite and @xcite reported on the euv waves that were stopped by remote coronal holes as well as near the separatrix between active regions , where they may appear as a `` stationary '' front @xcite .",

    "@xcite found the evidence for an euv wave that was reflected by a remote coronal hole , implying that the euv transients are possibly a true wave .",
    "@xcite found an euv wave that simultaneously exhibited both fast and slow wave components . in their case ,",
    "the preceding slow component was overtaken by the following fast component one , and the interaction between them not only produced multiple ripples but also steeped the local amplitude of the wave .",
    "this behavior is the characteristic of a real wave .",
    "the euv waves were also observed to interact with remote filaments , which usually caused the oscillations of filaments @xcite .",
    "stereoscopic observations taken by _ solar - terrestrial relations observatory _ ( _ stereo _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were used to study the three - dimensional kinematics of euv waves @xcite , which improved the characterization of the euv waves due to its relatively high temporal and spatial resolution and multi - angle observations .",

    "this height range is comparable to the coronal scale - height of 50100 mm for quiet - sun temperatures of 12 mk .",
    "in addition , the evidence of angular rotation for the euv waves during propagation has also been reported @xcite .",
    "when euv waves occur on the disk limb , they often exhibit a dome - shaped structure that enables us to further study the relationship between the euv waves and the associated cmes .",
    "so far several such observations have been documented @xcite , and the authors have shown that the expanding cmes are preceded by the euv waves , and they thereby propose that the euv waves are driven by the expanding cmes .",

    "stimulated by the findings of @xcite and @xcite , a numerical field - line stretching model was also proposed to explain the euv waves @xcite , which is based on the erupting of a flux rope and predicts a very fast super - alfvnic piston - driven shock preceding a slower pseudo - wave that is associated with the successive opening of the overlying magnetic field induced by the erupting flux rope . in this model , the authors argued that the fast shock might be the coronal counterpart of the moreton wave observed in h@xmath5 wavelengths , while the slow pseudo - wave behind the shock corresponds to the euv wave observed in the corona .",

    "an overview of the euv wave event is shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the propagation of the euv wave was restricted within a conical sector of the quiet - sun corona , in which a filament and a few bright points can be identified ( indicated by the black arrows in figure  [ fig2 ] ( a ) and ( b ) ) . before the appearance of the primary wave ( w2 )",

    "this technique can minimize the spherical projection effect .",
    "however , since the euv wave presented here did not propagate along the great circles passing through the flare kernel , we define the paths that are perpendicular to the wavefronts to obtain the time - distance diagrams , which should reflect the kinematics projection for the wave in the plane of the sky .",
    "we show the morphological evolution of the euv wave in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "note that the insets are the aia 193   running difference images , which show the euv waves clearly . before the start of the x1.9 flare",
    ", a small plasma ejection can be identified on the aia 193   base - difference images .",
    "several minutes later , a weak euv wave ( w1 ) preceding the plasma ejection can be observed at about 09:33:55 ut ( see the inset in figure  [ fig3](a ) ) .",
    "this wave was possibly driven by the small plasma ejection behind it . at about 09:37:07 ut ,",
    "the primary euv wave ( w2 ) appeared clearly on the aia 193   difference images , which was preceded by w1 ( see the inset in figure  [ fig3](b ) ) .",
    "obviously , the propagation of w2 was faster than that of w1 , which can be identified by comparing the distance between them at different times ( see the insets in figure  [ fig3 ] and animation1 available in the online version of the journal ) . during the initial stage of w2 , an expanding dimming region behind the wavefront formed following the propagation of w2",
    "the w2 wavefront during this period broadened gradually but still remained rather compact , while the propagation direction changed gradually from southeastward to westward . however , after or around 09:44 ut , while the dimming region stopped its expansion , the euv wave still continued its propagation to an increasing distance up to the central meridian of the sun . during this time period ,",
    "the shape of the wavefront became more diffuse and the wavefront broadened a lot as seen in panel figure  [ fig3](f ) .",
    "these observational results suggest that the euv wave should have been driven by the cme expanding flanks as proposed in several studies @xcite , in which the coronal dimming region should map the cme footprint on the solar surface , and the euv wave can start to propagate freely after the driving of the cme expanding flanks . on the other hand , _",
    "stereo_-b also catched the euv wave , and we show the 195   base - difference images in figure  [ fig3](g)(i ) . by comparing the propagating wave in the aia and _ stereo_-b observations",
    ", one can see that this wave was a surface wave that was probably trapped within a certain height in the corona .",
    "triangulation of the euv wave ( using the procedure `` scc_measure.pro '' developed by w. thompson ) indicates that the propagation height of this euv wave ranges from 60 to 100 mm above the photosphere , in agreement with the results reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we study the kinematics of the euv wave using the time - distance diagrams obtained along curves c2c4 as shown in figure  [ fig2](b ) .",
    "the euv wave could be observed in all euv channels of aia across a wide temperature range and it showed similar kinematics in these euv channels .",
    "here , we only show the euv wave using the time - distance diagrams obtained from aia 193 and 304   base- and running difference images ( see figure  [ fig4 ] ) . in each time - distance diagram , the euv wave displays as a slightly curved bright ridge . the slope of the bright ridge , which is defined as the ratio of the distance to the time within a limited period , represents the propagation speed of the euv wave .",
    "one can see that the euv wave could only be observed at a minimum distance of about 170 mm from the flare kernel . in the time - distance diagram along c2",
    ", an oscillating loop can be identified after the passing of the euv wave ( see the blue arrow in figure  [ fig4](a ) and the black arrow in figure  [ fig3](d ) ) .",
    "this oscillating loop can be best seen in the aia 171   base - difference time - distance diagram ( see figure  [ fig5](c ) ) .",
    "it oscillated for several cycles before totally damping , and the oscillation period is about 500 s. when the euv wave was passing through bp1 , it interacted with bp1 and its propagation speed changed significantly ( see the red arrows in figure  [ fig4](a ) ) .",
    "the same effect can also be identified in the time - distance diagram along c4 , where the speed of the euv wave also changed obviously after its interaction with another bright points ( bp2 ) ( see the red arrows in figure  [ fig4](d ) ) .",
    "the changes of the euv wave speed might be caused by the reflection or refraction of the euv wave at the bright points , indicating the wave nature for this euv wave .",
    "both time - distance diagrams obtained from aia 193   base- and running difference images along c3 are shown in figure  [ fig4 ] ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively . from the base - difference time - distance diagram",
    ", one can see that the dimming region stopped its expansion at around 09:44 ut and lasted for a long time .",
    "the outer edge of the dimming region kept at a distance of about 50 mm from the flare kernel . in the meantime ,",
    "the euv wave propagated out continuously before indiscernible on the visible disk . besides the obvious primary wave stripe observed in the running difference time - distance diagrams ,",
    "there are a few secondary wave tracks that could also be identified in the time - distance diagrams obtained from c3 and c4 ( see the yellow arrows in figure  [ fig4 ] ) . by checking the time - lapse movies made from the aia observations , we find that these secondary waves were probably excited by some coronal structures when they interacted with the primary euv wave , unlike the slow pseudo - wave predicted in the numerical model by @xcite . along c4 , the wave stripe that represents w1 can be identified in the aia 193   running difference time - distance diagram",
    "( see the green arrow in figure  [ fig4](d ) ) .",
    "the speed of w1 was obviously slower than that of w2 , and it was overtaken by w2 at about 09:40 ut .",
    "after that w1 was undetectable anymore .",
    "we show the interaction of the euv wave with the filament using the aia 304   running difference time - distance diagram ( figure  [ fig4](e ) ) . after the passing of the primary euv wave ( w2 ) , the filament started to oscillate for a few cycles but never erupt ( see the blue arrows in figure  [ fig4](e ) and figure  [ fig5](d ) ) .",
    "the period of the oscillating filament is about 880 s. it is worth noting that the reflection of w2 by the south polar coronal hole was also observed , and we show the reflected wave in figure  [ fig5](e ) , which propagated northward at a speed of about 156 km  s@xmath0 in the plane of the sky . here , we failed to detect the incident w2 and the interaction of w2 with the coronal hole in the time - distance diagram as shown in figure  [ fig5](e ) , since w2 had become very diffuse when it reached the coronal hole . however , the start time of the possibly reflected wave was consistent with the estimated arrival time of w2 to the coronal hole , and the time - lapse movie made from the aia 193   observations confirms the reflected wave from the polar coronal hole .",
    "thus we believe that the detected wave along path s1 was the reflected wave of w2 from the polar coronal hole .",
    "the speeds and accelerations of w1 and w2 in the plane of the sky are plotted in figure  [ fig6 ] , in which the values of distance and time are determined from the time - distance diagrams shown in figure  [ fig4 ] . the speeds and accelerations",
    "are obtained by making a linear ( green line ) and quadratic ( red line ) fit to the data sets respectively .",
    "the dotted part of each fitted line is a back - extrapolation of the fitted lines .",
    "as seen in this figure , the propagations of both w1 and w2 exhibit a significant deceleration along each cut .",
    "the speed ( acceleration ) of w1 is about 403 km  s@xmath0 ( -185 m  s@xmath1 ) . for w2 ,",
    "its speed ranges from 492 km  s@xmath0 to 690 km  s@xmath0 and the average value is about 570 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the acceleration ranges from -37 m  s@xmath1 to -220 m  s@xmath1 and the average value is about -130 m  s@xmath1 .",
    "according to the classification of euv waves performed by @xcite , this euv wave should be a nonlinear large - amplitude fast - mode wave that propagates faster than the ambient fast - mode speed and subsequently slow down due to decreasing amplitude .",
    "after the interaction of w2 with the bright points , the propagation speed of the euv wave showed an obvious variation , of which the euv wave accelerated ( decelerated ) significantly when passing through bp1 ( bp2 ) , and the propagation speed of the wave after interaction is about 653 km  s@xmath0 ( 354 km  s@xmath0 ) along c2 ( c4 ) . since the propagation behavior of the euv wave can not be distinguished on the imaging observations , we conjecture that the significant variation of the wave speed after the interaction with the bright points is caused by the changing of the propagating direction of the euv wave during its interaction with the bright points , that is , due to the refraction or reflection effect .",
    "in addition , the speed ( acceleration ) of w2 along c4 at aia 304   is about 637 km  s@xmath0 ( -159 m  s@xmath1 ) , similar to the speed determined from aia 193   observations along the same path .",
    "the back - extrapolation of the fitted lines indicates that the initiation time of w2 should be close to the onset time of the associated flare .",
    "this result seems to indicate a close relationship between the wave and the flare and thereby favors the scenario that euv waves are driven by flares ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , it is well known that the cme acceleration profile can be correlated with the flare lightcurve ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is also consistent with the cme driven scenario of the euv waves .",
    "in fact , the complex relationships among flares , cmes and euv waves are still unclear . in this sense ,",
    "any apparent relation of the euv wave onset time with the flare does not necessarily means that the flare is really related to the wave launch .",
    "the perturbation profiles of w2 along c3 are plotted in figure  [ fig7](a)(f ) .",
    "these profiles are obtained from a time - distance diagram that is made from a series of aia 193   ratio images , where each frame is divided by a pre - event frame .",
    "it should be noted that we only show the profiles of the euv wave within a distance from 350 to 480 mm from the flare kernel , where the wave was most prominent as marked by the two red `` @xmath13 '' symbols in figure  [ fig4](b ) .",
    "the propagation of the euv wave is well reflected by the evolution of these perturbation profiles . at 09:41:55 ut , the perturbation profile is the steepest and has the highest amplitude of about 2.3 , corresponding to an enhancement of 130% above the pre - event level . in the subsequent evolution ,",
    "the amplitude of the wavefront decreases continuously with time . in the meantime , the width ( steepness ) of the wavefront shows significant broadening ( declining ) . in principle , the aia 193   channel is an optically thin emission line , and the observed intensity should be proportional to the square of the plasma density and a function related to temperature .",
    "therefore , the enhancement of intensity can result from the increase of both density and temperature .",
    "however , since euv waves are usually observed in a wide temperature range simultaneously , one can assume that the intensity enhancement is primarily due to plasma compression rather than temperature changing .",
    "so @xmath14 in 193   corresponds to a density ratio @xmath15 .",
    "we also investigate the evolution of the amplitude , the frontal full width at half maximum , and the full width of the wavefront in panels ( g ) , ( h ) , and ( i ) , respectively .",
    "the amplitude first decreases linearly and then keeps at a lower level , while the width increases monotonically during the entire evolution process .",
    "these results imply that the propagating euv wave has a dispersive nature , confirming the results of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that these characteristic parameters of the wavefront might be affected by the changes in the quiet - sun as well as by the brightenings induced by the wavefront passage such as the so - called `` stationary brightenings '' @xcite .",
    "by combining the high temporal and spatial resolution observations taken by _ sdo _ and _ stereo _ , we investigate the detailed kinematics of the euv wave that occurred on september 24 , 2011 .",
    "the euv wave was accompanied by a _ goes _",
    "x1.9 flare and a fast partial halo cme .",
    "we find that there are several main arguments supporting the scenario that the observed large - scale propagating wave - like disturbances in the corona should be a compressive fast - mode magnetosonic wave , and it was driven by the cme expanding flanks during the initial stage of the euv wave .",
    "our main results are summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "the euv wave propagated along a conical sector region of the quiet - sun corona and can be observed in all euv channels of the aia across a wide temperature range .",
    "similar kinematics of the euv wave in these euv channels are identified .",
    "the euv wave ( 570 km  s@xmath0 ) propagated faster than the coronal sound speed in the quiet - sun corona ( @xmath2 200 km  s@xmath0 ) , and the propagation showed a pronounced deceleration ( -130 m  s@xmath1 ) .",
    "this kinematical behavior of the euv wave presented in this paper is consistent with the behaviors of the nonlinear large - amplitude waves that propagate faster than the ambient fast - mode magnetosonic speed and subsequently slow down due to decreasing amplitude @xcite .",
    "the wave natures of the euv wave presented here are reflected through its interaction with other coronal magnetic structures along its propagation path , such as the oscillation of the loop and the filament , the reflection of the euv wave from the remote polar coronal hole , and the variation of the propagation speed of the euv wave due to the refraction or reflection effect of the bright points .",
    "these phenomena are not consistent with those pseudo - wave models such as by @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the fact that the wave keeps propagating after the dimming has stopped to expand actually rules out the pseudo - wave models for the current event .",
    "the dimming region following the wavefront stopped to expand at about 09:44 ut and the outer edge of the dimming region kept at a distance of about 50 mm away from the flare kernel , but the euv wave continued propagating out for a long distance until indiscernible on the visible disk .",
    "this result supports the scenario that the euv waves are driven by the cme expanding flanks as suggested by many studies@xcite , in which the dimming region maps the cme footprint on the solar surface . after the driving of the cme expanding flanks , the euv wave started its free propagation stage , during which the wavefront became more diffuse .",
    "triangulation indicates that the propagation height of the euv wave ranges from 60 to 100 mm above the photosphere , which is consistent with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "6 .   for the characteristics of the perturbation profile of the propagating wavefront",
    ", we find that both the steepness of the wavefront s leading edge and the amplitude of the wavefront decrease continuously with time . in the meantime , the width of the perturbation profile of the wavefront broadens during its evolution process .",
    "this broadening is observed for both the full width as well as for the full width at half - maximum .",
    "these observations indicate that the propagating euv wavefront has a dispersive nature and could be described using a wave interpretation @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the formation of the 304   line is dominated by two chromospheric lines at 303.781 and 303.786  but a strong contribution from a coronal line at 303.32   in the 304   passband is also important , which has a peak formation temperature @xmath16 mk @xcite .",
    "our observational results demonstrate that the kinematics of the euv wave in 304   observations has a similar behavior with other euv lines , and the propagation height ( 60100 mm ) of this euv wave is higher than the height of the chromosphere .",
    "in addition , the wave signature is undetectable at the transition region line such as 1600  .",
    "thus we propose that the euv wave presented in this paper is just a coronal phenomenon and no chromospheric counterpart .",
    "the wave signature seen in the 304   passband is the manifestation of the contribution of the coronal line rather than the chromospheric lines .",
    "secondary waves were also observed behind the primary fast wave front , which looks like the pseudo - wave predicted int the hybrid model of @xcite .",
    "however , in this hybrid model , the speed of the slower pseudo - wave should be about one third of the speed of the preceding fast shock wave . in the case presented in this paper , we find that the speed of the secondary waves was just slightly smaller than that of the primary fast wave .",
    "this discrepancy stimulates us to clarify the origin of these secondary waves . by checking the time - elapse movies made from the aia data , we find that these secondary waves were probably generated by the interaction of the primary fast wave with the coronal structures on the wave propagation path , which is inconsistent with the slower pseudo - wave predict in the hybrid model presented by @xcite .    from the the profiles of the euv wavefront",
    ", we obtain the highest amplitude @xmath14 , which yields the peak density jump at the wavefront @xmath17 .",
    "this corresponds to a perpendicular fast magnetosonic wave mach number of @xmath18 @xcite , which implies that the euv wave presented in this paper should be a nonlinear fast - mode magnetosonic wave , confirming the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "along with the evolution of the euv wave , its amplitude decreases and thereby the mach number of the euv wave also decreases and approaches to a linear regime where the mach number is close to unity 1 . here , the results including the deceleration to a mach number of unity , amplitude decrease , and wave front broadening are all consistent with the nonlinear fast - mode wave scenario , as pointed out by @xcite , and recently defined as one distinct class of coronal waves by @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "our analysis results indicate that the euv wave presented in this paper should be a nonlinear fast - mode magnetosonic wave that was driven by the cme expanding flanks during the initial stage , and then it propagated freely in the solar corona within a certain height ranging from 60 to 100 mm above the photosphere .",
    "more investigations with high temporal and spatial resolution observations would be helpful to fully understand the physical nature of such propagating large - scale wave - like disturbances in the solar atmosphere .    is a mission for nasa s living with a star ( lws ) program .",
