    "at high temperatures , the natural state of a liquid crystal is the isotropic phase , because all the molecule orientations are equally probable . at low temperatures ,",
    "an order along a preferred direction may appear , it is the nematic phase .",
    "when such a material is cooled at even lower temperatures , other types of ordered phases are likely to appear , the description of which requires realistic potentials ( see e.g. reference @xcite ) .",
    "the transition between the isotropic and the nematic phases generally occurs at a critical temperature .",
    "various experiments on three - dimensional liquid crystals , exhibited a weak first order transition @xcite .",
    "however , the corresponding two - dimensional ( 2d ) problem is far from begin that clear .",
    "experimentally , only 2d liquid crystals composed of long rigid interacting rods have been studied .",
    "first , the 2d problem must be defined through the symmetries : there are generally a continuous global symmetry @xmath0 , and a local @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "for example , the two most - studied models deal with @xmath2 ( the xy - model ) , or @xmath3 ( the heisenberg model ) symmetries .",
    "the hamiltonian reads in both cases as : @xmath4 with @xmath5 a @xmath6-components spin , of unit length , at the lattice site @xmath7 .",
    "the sum runs over all pairs of neighbouring spins of the 2d square lattice and @xmath8 is the spin - spin coupling constant .",
    "according to the mermin - wagner - hohenberg theorem @xcite , the order parameter fluctuations prevent from any spontaneous breakdown of continuous symmetries for 2d systems with short - range interactions .",
    "however , this theorem can not conclude in the case of transitions to a phase with no long range order .",
    "an example of such a 2d critical behaviour , which is not a continuous - symmetry breaking , is the 2d xy - model ( @xmath2 , abelian symmetry ) .",
    "this model presents a topological transition characterized by a critical low temperature phase as a plasma of vortices pairs , at temperatures under the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless transition temperature , @xmath9 @xcite . at much lower temperatures ,",
    "the system state is dominated by spin waves .",
    "the high temperature phase occurs when the pairs dissociate .    on the other hand ,",
    "the 2d heisenberg model ( @xmath3 , non - abelian symmetry ) has no transition at any finite temperature ( asymptotic freedom ) @xcite .",
    "the longitudinal modes of the @xmath3 model are frozen for the low temperatures , and only the transverse modes are activated , leading essentially to two gaussian modes .",
    "the deep difference between the two models at finite temperatures , is the stability of the vortices .",
    "indeed , the topological transition of the 2d xy - model is the result of the stability of the topological defects , while the  third spin dimension \" in the @xmath3 model , makes the vortices unstable at any finite temperature .",
    "however , the above picture has been questioned recently by the numerical evidences for a possible transition in the 2d heisenberg model @xcite .",
    "moreover it has been shown that a quasi long range order ( qlro ) phase @xcite might appear at very low temperatures in finite systems . indeed in these numerical works , the thermodynamic limit remains questionable and the analytic approach of @xcite relies explicitly on the finite size of the lattice .    a model for a regular 2d liquid crystal system",
    "was proposed by lebwohl and lasher ( ll ) @xcite .",
    "based on a lattice version of the mean field theory of maier and saupe @xcite , the molecules are represented by @xmath10component unit vectors and the  spin - spin \" interactions are given by the second legendre polynomial , @xmath11 ( keeping the local @xmath1 symmetry ) .",
    "the popularity of the ll - model comes from its ability to reproduce the weak first order phase transition observed experimentally between the isotropic and the nematic phases @xcite in the three - dimensional space .",
    "then , the question of possible phase transitions in this model is attractive and has been addressed in numerous studies .",
    "@xcite    in the past twenty years , several numerical evidences pointed out a possible topological transition for the 2d nematic - isotropic phase transition in liquid crystals .",
    "the situation is clear in the case of planar rotator models ( see e.g. references @xcite ) , but still controversial for three - component models . in reference",
    "@xcite , we have studied the nematic - isotropic transition of 2d liquid crystals using a @xmath2 vector model characterized by nonlinear nearest - neighbour spin interactions governed by the fourth legendre polynomial @xmath12 . the system has been studied through standard finite - size scaling and conformal rescaling of the density profiles .",
    "we also estimated the binder cumulant @xcite as a function of the temperature for different values of system size @xmath13 .",
    "this cumulant has been proved to be universal at a critical temperature .",
    "evidences for a topological transition at a finite temperature have been underlined .    in the case of the three - component model , in a remarkable work kunz and zumbach @xcite concluded in favour of such a critical topological transition .",
    "although they performed a careful and sizable study , they were unable to decide conclusively between essential singularities or standard power laws for the correlation length and the susceptibility , when approaching the critical temperature from the high temperature phase .",
    "however , they developed a qualitative picture ( pairing of topological defects which carry most part of the system energy , sharp increase of the defects density and seeming discontinuity of the rotational - rigidity modulus , finite cusp of the specific heat , proliferation of unbounded defects at high temperature ) and their conclusion inclined clearly to the essential singularity , for a temperature @xmath9 .",
    "more recently , we studied the 2d ll - model @xcite , and found signals in favour of a qlro phase at @xmath14 , with a magnetization that decays with the system size as a power law with the critical exponent @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "we obtained good agreement with the @xmath16 exponent obtained using the powerful technique of the conformal transformation @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the value of @xmath16 was estimated using directly the susceptibility , and the agreement appeared to be reasonable .",
    "possible discrepancy could come from the finite size of the systems .",
    "this qlro phase could be similar to the low temperature phase of the 2d xy - model .",
    "mondal and roy @xcite , using standard finite size scaling method and monte carlo simulations for the 2d ll - model , gave arguments for a continuous phase transition .",
    "the critical temperature was estimated to be @xmath17 , a little higher than @xmath18 calculated in @xcite .",
    "a still more recent study reported evidences in favour of a topological transition @xcite .",
    "then , the transition might be driven by stable topologically point defects known as @xmath19-disclination points .    despite 20 years of numerical results claiming for a topological transition for the 2d ll - model , a recent work called seriously this scenario into question .",
    "indeed , precise estimates of the binder cumulant for various system sizes , have been unable to show any crossing point at a definite temperature @xcite .",
    "this result contradicts completely the transition scenario at a critical point . in the same work @xcite , the possibility of a qlro phase at @xmath20 ( a value well below the",
    " transition \" temperature estimated previously for this model ) was questioned .",
    "two strong evidences were given to conclude that the 2d lebwohl - lasher model does not show any quasi - long - range ordered phase .",
    "the evidences were the violation of the hyperscaling relation between the apparent exponents of the magnetization and the susceptibility , and the failure of the first - scaling collapse @xcite of the probability distribution function of the order parameter .",
    "the main goal of the present work is to present a complementary investigation of the 2d ll - model .",
    "we will compare with the same tools this model with the 2d xy- and heisenberg models , for which the critical behaviours are not questionable .",
    "since the 2d ll - model seems to share some common properties with both the xy- and heisenberg models , it appears helpful to provide the comparisons . in section [ orderparameter ]",
    "we will analyze the system with and without an applied magnetic field using the finite size scaling method ( fss ) .",
    "the results which follow from conformal transformation method ( ct ) will also be reminded @xcite .",
    "we shall recover the apparent evidences for a sort of topological transition similar to the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless transition .",
    "however , we will see in the section [ sec : pdfhyper ] , with new results on the shape of the tail of the probability distribution function for the magnetization , check of the hyperscaling relation , and study of the stiffness , how improbable is the reality of a critical topological transition , confirming the results of @xcite .",
    "we will consider hereafter the 2d xy - model @xcite , the 2d heisenberg model @xcite , and the 2d lebwohl - lasher model @xcite .",

    "the high - temperature phase is a disordered phase with the vanishing stiffness .",
    "the change of behaviour in the stiffness modulus between the two phases exhibits the appearance of a topological phase transition , with quasi - long - range order , but finite rigidity , in the low temperature phase .    for the 2d ll - model",

    "however , beyond the similarities , one can remark that the stabilization to a finite value of the stiffness in the low - temperature phase , is not similar in both models .",
    "one can see this point , in particular analyzing the dependences with the system size . in figure ( [ fig : rigvslxy ] ) , @xmath142 is shown versus @xmath13 for three different temperatures of the 2d xy - model .",

    "a detailed study of the stiffness for frustrated spin systems can be found in @xcite .",
    "our initial goal was to give definite conclusions about the possible appearance of a critical topological transition , for example of the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless type , in the 2d lebwhol - lasher model .",
    "our results exhibit a scenario more complex than expected .",
    "it can be summarized as follows :    * the behaviour of the order parameter ( the magnetization ) with the temperature and the system size , pointed out a quasi - long range order phase for temperatures below the value @xmath116 .",
    "one has noticed an excellent agreement of the correlation exponent @xmath51 estimated using conformal transformation , scaling of the order parameter with @xmath13 , including scaling with a magnetic field . * if we investigate a quantity related to the second moment of the order parameter , that is the susceptibility , a _ qualitative _ agreement with a qlro phase behaviour is observed .",
    "however , the value obtained for @xmath51 from this quantity does not compare well with the estimates from the order parameter .",
    "actually , the hyperscaling relation ( [ eq : hyper ] ) is not satisfied for @xmath157 .",
    "this is in clear contradiction with the possibility of a line of critical point below @xmath50 .",
    "then , one has to conclude that a bkt transition is not observed for this model . *",
    "although not studied in the present paper , the behaviour of the binder cumulant ( which depends on the fourth moment of the order parameter ) , as reported in @xcite , fully supports the above conclusion : no universality is observed at any finite temperature .",
    "signs of qlro just disappear if larger moments of the order parameters are used . *",
    "as the conclusion seems to depend on the order of the moment of the magnetization , it looks natural to use the complete probability distribution function of the order parameter to clarify the situation . unlike the 2d xy - model",
    ", the 2d ll - model does not show any first - scaling - law collapse as it would be expected for a critical system .",
    "the absence of self - similarity at any temperature discards any sort of transition in this model , which thus appears more similar to the heisenberg model than to the xy - model eventually . *",
    "the stiffness modulus mixes a second and a fourth moment of the order parameter . for the 2d ll - model",
    ", this quantity does not exhibit an _ order - parameter behaviour_. at low temperatures a logarithmic decay with @xmath13 is observed , and asymptotic finite values are highly unlikely , resulting in a non rigid phase at low temperatures .",
    "our conclusion , based only on numerical simulations , is that the 2d ll - model shares similarities with the fully frustrated antiferromagnetic heisenberg model ( see @xcite ) .",
    "then , the overall behaviour could well be a sharp crossover @xcite , instead of a real transition to a critical phase , a new kind of frustration preventing the topological defects of the ll - model to initiate a true phase transition .",
