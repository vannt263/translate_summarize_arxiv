    "the presence of magnetic fields in objects of astrophysical interest is evident . starting from the earth s magnetic field , to the solar magnetically driven phenomena and at the most extreme from magnetars to the recently observed filaments in the perseus cluster of galaxies @xcite",
    ", magnetic fields play an important rle in the evolution of the object they occur in .",
    "the study of the magnetic fields is complicated due to the form of partial differential equations that have to be solved and their non - linear behaviour .",
    "for this reason most of the research has been done on equilibrium configurations . even in the non - relativistic limit a few of the published studies are analytical , for instance @xcite whereas most of them are computational i.e. @xcite and references therein . in the relativistic case",
    "the studies are mainly motivated by pulsar magnetospheres , @xmath1-ray bursts , and relativistic jets .",
    "most of the solutions are numerical , for instance @xcite and only a few of them are analytic @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study the problem of a force - free relativistic electromagnetic field inspired by the studies previously made by @xcite for the geometry and the symmetry used ; and from @xcite for the relativistic generalisation we make .",
    "@xcite showed that it is possible to study magnetic fields that expand uniformly within a sphere .",
    "these fields emerge from a point , obey the ideal mhd relation @xmath2 and the net electromagnetic force is zero , then he solved the partial differential equation he found assuming a linear form . in this paper",
    "we show that an analogue case that permits analytical solutions and allows us to include time evolution exists for cylindrical magnetic fields .",
    "the field emerges from a linear singularity as in @xcite who studied this type of fields in the static limit , but in our problem the field expands radially .",
    "the expansion velocity is proportional to the distance from the axis and inversely proportional to time , thus every element of the plasma moves at constant speed .",
    "the expansion is slow near the axis and reaches the speed of light on a cylindrical surface .",
    "there is no field in the space outside this surface .",
    "the field viewed in the co - moving frame of reference obeys the force - free relation in the non - relativistic sense @xmath3 as there is only magnetic field present , whereas in the frame of reference at rest with respect to the axis the net electromagnetic force by taking into account both the interaction of the magnetic fields with the currents and the interaction of the electric fields with the charges is zero . in the limit of low velocities",
    "the equation obtained is similar to the grad - shafranov partial differential equation studied for the case of magnetic fields in equilibrium in the absence of pressure , but for relativistic velocities they differ considerably .",
    "we proceed on the derivation of the equation and then we solve it for various cases .",
    "assume a non - resistive plasma of negligible inertia containing a magnetic field @xmath4 and an electric field @xmath5 in cylindrical geometry @xmath6 , these fields do not depend on @xmath7 .",
    "the electric field is related to the magnetic by the definition of ideal mhd @xmath2 , where @xmath8 is the velocity of the plasma normalized to the speed of light .",
    "in addition assume that the plasma expands with @xmath9 the magnetic field can be described by a flux function @xmath10 for the @xmath11 and @xmath12 components , and leave without any constraint the @xmath13 component yet , apart from @xmath14 @xmath15 or @xmath16 the term arising from the gradient of @xmath17 will be called coplanar field @xmath18 . from the ideal mhd relation",
    "the electric field is @xmath19 the magnetic and the electric field must satisfy maxwell s equations .",
    "indeed , a magnetic field of the above form is by construction divergence - free .",
    "the induction equation is @xmath20 then by substituting equations ( [ magnetic ] ) and ( [ electric ] ) into equation ( [ induction0 ] ) we find that the equations for the @xmath21 and @xmath22 components are satisfied . in order the @xmath7 component of equation ( [ induction0 ] ) to be equal to zero",
    ", @xmath13 has to satisfy the following partial differential equation @xmath23 we re - express @xmath24 , substituting this into equation ( [ diffbz ] ) gives @xmath25 therefore @xmath26 , so @xmath13 can be written as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is an arbitrary function of @xmath29 and @xmath22 .",
    "the two remaining maxwell s equations are used to evaluate the charge ( @xmath30 ) and the current density ( @xmath31 ) , @xmath32 @xmath33 as we are looking for fields which are force - free in this generalized sense we demand that the total force the electric and the magnetic fields exert to charge and current densities is zero .",
    "this force is @xmath34 thus , by substituting the current and charge density found above into equation ( [ force ] ) we evaluate all three components of the force . from the @xmath35 component",
    "we take @xmath36 then we multiply equation ( [ zforce ] ) by @xmath37 and re - arragne the terms @xmath38^{3/2}w)}{\\partial \\phi}\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial v } \\nonumber \\\\",
    "-\\big[(1-v^{2})^{3/2}\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial v}-3v(1-v^{2})^{1/2}w\\big]\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial \\phi}=0\\ , .",
    "\\label{jacobian1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] setting @xmath39 equation ( [ jacobian1 ] ) reduces to @xmath40 which is the jacobian of @xmath41 and @xmath17 with respect to @xmath29 and @xmath22 . as it equals zero , @xmath42 ,",
    "thus @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is an arbitrary function of @xmath17 .",
    "given that , the @xmath7 component of the magnetic field becomes @xmath45 using equation ( [ bz ] ) in the force equation ( [ force ] ) the @xmath21 and @xmath22 components of the force are both zero when @xmath46 this is the cylindrical version of prendergast s equation , which is the basic equation deduced in this paper and our major aim hereafter is to find analytical and semi - analytical solutions .",
    "it simplifies if we apply the transformation @xmath47 @xmath48 this is a convenient form of the force - free equation , which we shall use later in this paper to find analytical solutions .",
    "in what follows we study equation ( [ eqn ] ) and forms that allow separable solutions of the form @xmath49 in order to do so , we investigate forms of @xmath41 which permit separation of variables .",
    "@xmath41 is any function of @xmath17 and this gives a great freedom on the solutions of the basic equation ( [ eqn ] ) , which may be highly non - linear if such a form is chosen .",
    "at first we study the form of the equation in the non - relativistic limit , then solutions in the absence of a @xmath7 component of the magnetic field and then solutions of the linearized form of equation ( [ eqn ] ) .      for @xmath50 equation ( [ eqn ] )",
    "reduces to @xmath51 separable solutions are allowed in two cases . in the linear case for @xmath52 , equation ( [ nonrel ] ) becomes @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the constant of separation and it is a real number as @xmath55 has to be periodic .",
    "the solution to the angular part is @xmath56 the differential equation for @xmath57 admits bessel functions of order @xmath54 for solutions @xmath58 the constants @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 can be evaluated subject to the boundary conditions .",
    "the horizontal shear causing the @xmath7 component of the field is parametrized by the constant @xmath63 .",
    "the other class of separable solutions is for @xmath64 and @xmath65derived by @xcite , who studied a problem of the same geometry in the static case . indeed",
    "if we substitute the forms above in equation ( [ nonrel ] ) , the terms involving @xmath29 cancel and we take an ordinary differential equation for @xmath55 @xmath66 this equation can be solved numerically , subject to the boundary conditions and the parameters @xmath63 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "it is possible to by - pass the numerical solution of equation ( [ fnonrel ] ) and construct an approximate solution for @xmath67 close to zero as the one found by @xcite , by normalizing to unity @xmath69 we find @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "if @xmath67 is no more small then we can use the more accurate and compicated form described in appendix a of @xcite .",
    "although the mathematical treatment described above is the same to aly s case , the two equations describe distinct physical configurations .",
    "the fields in our problem are not static but expand while being force - free .",
    "this growth can also be conceived as some flux generated from the base and expanding with velocity equal to @xmath73 . in aly",
    "s case the fields are static , however it is possible to achieve expansion due to the shearing of the field lines on the surface of the cylinder .",
    "that problem is studied as a sequence of static solutions where the transition from one solution to the next one takes place slowly enough so that the displacement current is negligible . in our case",
    "the shearing does not change explicitly with time as it is imposed from the beginning .",
    "however it is possible to assume the field lines to be sheared slowly , indeed as discussed by @xcite mhd systems where the boundary conditions change slowly have negligible induction currents and pass through a sequence of equilibrium stages . in our case",
    ", if the shearing of the field lines takes place slowly , then a series of force - free solutions of expanding fields describes this process .",
    "thus the shearing of the field lines may take place simultaneously with the expansion .      here",
    "we investigate solutions of the fully relativistic equation ( [ eqn ] ) without neglecting any term . first we study solutions in the absence of a @xmath7 component for the magnetic field which gives a coplanar magnetic field without any current and charge density and then solutions containing all three components by assuming a linear form for the right hand side of the differential equation .",
    "the simplest non - trivial solution of equation ( [ eqn ] ) exists in the absence of a @xmath7 component of the magnetic field , @xmath74 .",
    "it is a magnetic field that emerges from the surface of a cylinder where no shear is imposed . in this configuration",
    "there is no current or electric charge .",
    "we shall use equation ( [ eqn1 ] ) as this form is more convenient , let @xmath75 and derivatives to be denoted by dash , equation ( [ eqn1 ] ) becomes @xmath76 the solution of the angular part is of sinusoidal form @xmath77 the solution for @xmath78 is @xmath79 this corresponds to a coplanar magnetic field , where every magnetic field line lies on a plane normal to the axis of the cylinder .",
    "unlike the non - relativistic equation , which admits two classes of separable solutions when @xmath80 , in the relativistic regime , separable solutions exist only in the linear case , and there is no analogue to the non - relativistic powerlaws . to show this assume separable solutions of the standard form ;",
    "in division of equation ( [ eqn1 ] ) by @xmath17 it is @xmath81 the first term of the left hand side is only a function of @xmath82 and can be expressed as @xmath83 , the second term similarly is @xmath84 , as for the right hand side let @xmath85 .",
    "the next step is to act with the operators @xmath86 and in the resulting expression with the operator @xmath87 ; the final equation is @xmath88 then name @xmath89 and substitute above , @xmath90 from equation ( [ separation ] ) it is @xmath91 which leads to @xmath92 and the form of @xmath93 that permits separation of variables is @xmath94 .",
    "when substituting these forms in the right hand side of equation ( [ eqn1 ] ) it becomes a sum of a term that only depends on @xmath82 and one that only depends on @xmath22 , however when the left hand side of the equation is considered the terms involving @xmath82 do not sum up to a constant thus it is impossible to separate the equation by using power laws .",
    "it is only the linear form for @xmath95 , which permits separation of variables , indeed @xmath96 the angular part admits again sinusoidal solutions , as for the @xmath78 the equation to solve is @xmath97 which can not be integrated analytically and we solve it numerically .",
    "the numerical solution of equation ( [ linearv ] ) depends on the choice of the parameters and the boundary conditions .",
    "assume that some flux emerges from a cylindrical surface @xmath98 at time @xmath99 which in velocity space lies @xmath100 , the boundary conditions for @xmath57 on this surface are determined by the fields .",
    "the fields are expressed in terms of @xmath57 and @xmath55 , they are @xmath101 @xmath102 @xmath103 the value of @xmath57 on the surface the flux emerges from is related to the intensity of the @xmath21 component of the magnetic field and the derivative @xmath104 to the intensity of @xmath22 component , in what follows we use the normalised value @xmath105 . then the parameters @xmath63 and @xmath54 are chosen and we integrate the differential equation .",
    "the physical meaning of the parameter @xmath63 is related to the horizontal shear of the field lines and therefore since @xmath13 is proportional to @xmath63 , the more shear is induced on the base of the field the larger this parameter is .",
    "an inspection of the differential equation even without proceeding to the numerical solution demonstrates the decelerating effect of this term , greater shear leads to a stronger @xmath13 component of the magnetic field .",
    "this component is proportional to @xmath106 and exerts a strong force to the magnetic field .",
    "thus , the flux decreases rapidly for @xmath29 close to unity .",
    "after this point the solution undergoes oscillations ( figures 1 , 2 ) and the field forms disconnected appendages .",
    "these structures are the result of the linear assumption made previously .",
    "it is now possible to draw the field lines for any time @xmath107 ( figures 3 , 4 ) as we have the expressions for @xmath57 and @xmath55 and the field lines are given by substituting expressions ( [ br ] ) , ( [ bf ] ) and ( [ b_z ] ) in @xmath108    ) .",

    "this decrease in the absolute value of the derivative leads to a weaker @xmath12 at @xmath116 , thus the field emerges closer to the perpendicular and the flux function reaches a greater @xmath117 before starting the oscillations.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    ) .",

    "plotted we choose four values for it , we find that for a smaller absolute value of @xmath104 the flux reaches greater distances in @xmath29 space ; thus fields where the ratio @xmath122 is bigger have fluxes that reach greater distances , so the more radial the flux is at the base the further it gets before it starts oscillating .",
    "in this section we study the shear and the energy stored in this configuration subject to @xmath63 .",
    "we assume that the same radial flux emerges from the surface by keeping @xmath123 the same and it reaches a maximum velocity @xmath117 also constant , where @xmath124 , given these boundary conditions we solve equation ( [ linearv ] ) for various values of the parameter @xmath63 .",
    "then we use the solutions to study the shear and the energy .",
    "the amount of shear for a given field line can be evaluated by integrating equation ( [ fieldlines ] ) after substituting the fields from equations ( [ br]-[b_z ] ) .",
    "an element of a field line labeled by @xmath125 that lies between @xmath29 and @xmath126 in velocity space is sheared by @xmath127 an important feature of this quantity is that it does not change as the field expands .",
    "we evaluate the total shear of a field line by integrating equation ( [ shear ] ) from @xmath116 where the field line emerges , up to the maximum @xmath128 it reaches , this @xmath128 is given by solving equation @xmath129 , then by symmetry the shear from the top to the other foot point is the same .",
    "inspection of equation ( [ shear ] ) shows that the shear depends on @xmath63 as it appears directly and indirectly in the integral through the form of @xmath57 which is a numerical solution depending on the parameter @xmath63 , there is also a dependence on the choice of the field line which also appears directly in the equation but also indirectly through the end point of integration @xmath128 which depends on @xmath125 . in table 1",
    "we use the results of the linear solution to evaluate the shear @xmath130 of the field line which has been stretched the most for a given @xmath63 .",
    "the numerical integration shows actually that as @xmath63 increases the shear increases , a proportionality relation between @xmath63 and @xmath131 is a first approximation , and the deviation of this approximation is due to the indirect dependence on @xmath63 through the other quantities appearing in ( [ shear ] ) .",
    "the total energy carried by an electromagnetic field in a volume @xmath132 is @xmath133 we can express the forms of the electric and the magnetic field in terms only of @xmath134 and @xmath29 and study the energy contained in a volume in velocity space and how it evolves with time . by substituting the forms of the magnetic fields from equations ( [ br]-[b_z ] ) and by the fact that @xmath2 the energy contained in a volume in velocity space with boundaries @xmath116 and @xmath117 , @xmath7 from @xmath135 to @xmath136 and @xmath22 from @xmath135 to @xmath137 , is @xmath138\\big\\}vdvd\\phi\\ , .",

    "thus it carries more energy .",
    "this increase on @xmath13 has also a side effect , for the field to remain force - free the coplanar component of the magnetic field @xmath18 and @xmath143 have to increase to balance the extra force .",

    "observations of @xmath1-ray flares @xcite suggest that they are associated to strong magnetic fields expanding with relativistic velocities .",
    "these flares are thought as potential origins of short duration @xmath1-ray bursts @xcite .",
    "the relativistic solution of the equations studied in this paper can be applied to the initial stages of magnetar giant flares emerging .",
    "it has been proposed @xcite that giant flares from @xmath1-ray repeaters are formed through processes similar to coronal mass ejections on the sun . as opposed to solar arcades , they reach high lorentz factors .",
    "our model describes the electromagnetic field of arcades which expand and reach relativistic velocities .",
    "when the flare expands with a great velocity it is essential to take into account the relativistic effects as extra terms appear on equation ( [ eqn ] ) compared to the non - relativistic form , equation ( [ nonrel ] ) . in our study the fields expand only in one dimension , this is a reasonable assumption when the magnetic arcades are not large compared to the radius of the object where they emerge from or when there is a primary direction of expansion .",
    "an other issue is the neglect of inertia forces , this is fine when the plasma is underdense and most energy is carried by the magnetic field .",
    "however very close to the speed of light , no matter how small the density is , it will be no more negligible as it will be multiplied by a large lorentz factor .",

    "these solutions offer a theoretical insight to both relativistic and non - relativistic expanding systems .",
    "the non - relativistic solutions have structural similarities to static ones where time is not explicitly included , but it is implied via a series of static solutions where the expansion is merely due to shearing of the magnetic field lines whereas the flux emerging from the surface is constant . in our case",
    "the field expands due to two reasons : shearing of the field lines as in the static problem and due to an increase of the flux emerging from the surface .",
    "the increase of flux appears directly in the equations .",
    "the plane parallel geometry also sets constraints to the applications of these solutions .",
    "astrophysical systems are more likely to occur in spherical geometry , a case studied previously @xcite , however this particular geometry leads to results of satisfactory accuracy compared to those of the spherical geometry when the radius the magnetic flux extends is comparable to the radius of curvature of the surface the magnetic field emerges .",
    "systems where the expansion is mainly in one dimension are also described by this geometry .",
    "an astrophysical system of interest is that of solar arcades , this model describes the combined effect of the extra flux emerging from the base and of the shearing of the field lines provided that the size of the arcade is small compared to the radius of the sun .",
    "a detailed comparison of plane parallel models and spherical ones can be found in @xcite and the loss of equilibrium in these models leading to the opening of the field lines has been studied by @xcite .",
    "it is also shown that the energy contained in the magnetic arcade increases when more shear is imposed .    in relativistic systems",
    "the demand of simultaneous expansion and shearing has some problems as the field at the top expands very fast whereas the shearing of the field lines at the base has to take place slowly .",
    "thus the message for the @xmath13 component to increase will arrive much later at the top . for this reason we consider that the magnetic field is sheared before the expansion takes place .",
