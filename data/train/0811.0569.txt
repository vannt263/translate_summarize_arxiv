    "the lhc will provide a wealth of data on the physics of the top quark @xcite .",
    "standard model pair production @xmath0 alone is approximately 830 picobarns , allowing for detailed study of top properties , such as spin correlations and rare decays .",
    "in addition , any new physics which is responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking must couple strongly to the top quark , leading to many events where top quarks are produced in association with new physics .    models which aim to stabilize the electroweak hierarchy typically predict a top quark partner , such as the stop squark in susy or the @xmath1 in little higgs models . in order to suppress contributions to precision electroweak observables ,",
    "this top partner is frequently taken to be odd under a discrete parity , which in turn typically leads to a new stable invisible particle .",
    "thus a standard signature of a broad class of well - motivated models is the production of a single top quark in the cascade decay of an on - shell top partner , accompanied by additional particles in the event and possibly missing energy .",
    "the coupling of top partners to top quarks is in general chiral , and a top quark produced in the cascade decay of a top partner will be polarized to a degree which depends on the kinematics of the decay chain as well as the couplings .",
    "the top undergoes weak decay before the process of hadronization can dilute information about its polarization , so the angular distributions of its daughter particles reflect the polarization of the parent top .",
    "observables which measure single top polarization can therefore yield measurements which are sensitive to the chiral structure of any new physics sector .",
    "we focus here on kinematic distributions which are can be used without fully reconstructed events . to fully reconstruct events with missing",
    "energy one must make assumptions about the event topology and the identities of particles not directly observed .",
    "this is not always desirable in events with high multiplicity final states and large missing energy . in such events hadronic",
    "top decays will likely be more useful than leptonic top decays for both event selection and top reconstruction , especially in the initial stages of analysis .",
    "fully collimated tops allow polarization study without full event reconstruction in _ both _ leptonic and hadronic decay modes , as in the collinear limit one may construct observables which become independent of the unknown boost between the top rest frame and the lab frame .    in section  [ sec : obs ]",
    "we discuss several observables whose distributions can measure single top polarization , for both collimated and uncollimated top quarks . in section  [ sec : signal ]",
    "we compute the polarization of top quarks produced from the cascade decay of a top partner to a top quark and an additional particle which is not directly observed . in section  [ sec :",
    "assembly ] , we relate this polarization to experimentally observable signals , and in section  [ sec : theend ] we conclude .",
    "in the standard model the top decays almost entirely through @xmath2 .",
    "the angular distributions of the final state particles depend on the spin of the top . in general the angular distribution of any one of the top s three daughter particles",
    "can be written @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the angle between the daughter fermion @xmath5 and the top spin axis , as measured in the top rest frame , and @xmath6 is the polarization of the top along that axis .",
    "we use conventions where a top with spin @xmath7 has @xmath8 .",
    "the `` spin analyzing power '' of the fermion @xmath9 , @xmath10 , is a calculable coefficient , which depends on the identity of @xmath5 .",
    "unitarity restricts @xmath11 decay ",
    "the charged lepton , in leptonic @xmath12 decays  is maximally correlated with the top spin , @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "therefore the charged lepton is the natural first object to consider in a study of top polarization .",
    "however , in many inclusive final states , @xmath14 , the leptonic decay mode may be of limited utility , as the neutrino makes top reconstruction indirect . while it is possible to study top polarization without reconstructing the top rest frame , for instance with highly boosted tops , the most direct window into top polarization uses knowledge of the top rest frame .",
    "moreover , depending on the particular study , top identification may proceed only via hadronic decays where three jets can be combined within the appropriate invariant mass window .",
    "it is therefore interesting to consider polarization - sensitive observables that can be constructed for hadronic top quarks .",
    "hadronically decaying tops present three natural candidate objects whose angular distributions measure the polarization of the parent top .",
    "one is the @xmath15-jet . at tree level ,",
    "the distribution of the @xmath15-quark is given by equation with @xmath16 one can also consider the angular distribution of the ( reconstructed ) @xmath12 boson , which is of the form  ( [ eq : top - general ] ) with _ w = -_b0.4 .",
    "the spin analyzing power of the @xmath15-jet ( or the reconstructed @xmath12 ) is less than half of the spin analyzing power of the anti - fermion from the decay of the @xmath12 .",
    "unfortunately , in hadronic decays , the down - quark jet can not be distinguished from the up - quark jet .",
    "however , in the top rest frame the down quark is on average less energetic than the up quark .",
    "thus the less energetic of the two light quark jets in the top rest frame constitutes another interesting object whose angular distribution can serve to measure the top quark polarization . at tree level , this jet has a net spin analyzing power @xcite @xmath17 where , again , @xmath18 denotes the less energetic of the two light quark jets in the top rest frame .",
    "leading qcd corrections to @xmath19 and @xmath20 have been calculated , and are of order a few percent @xcite . in both cases",
    "the effect of the qcd corrections is to decrease @xmath21 .",
    "depending on the method of top identification used in a given study , the angular distributions of one or several of the three objects mentioned here ( the @xmath15-jet , the reconstructed @xmath22 , or the softer of the two light quark jets ) can form attractive observables which are sensitive to the top quark polarization along the top quark direction of motion in the lab frame .",
    "suitably massive new physics may produce daughter top quarks which are highly boosted in the lab frame .",
    "the top decay products will then be partially or fully collimated , necessitating novel approaches to top identification and reconstruction @xcite . when the tops are highly collimated , the angular distributions discussed above can not be well measured and other kinematic variables are more appropriate .",
    "we first consider collimated hadronic tops .",
    "when the @xmath15-jet ( or equivalently the @xmath12 ) can be separately identified within the top , then the natural polarization - sensitive observable is the fraction of the lab - frame top energy carried by the @xmath15-jet , z = , where @xmath23 denotes the energy of a particle @xmath9 in the lab frame . taking the axis of polarization to be given by the top direction of motion ,",
    "the variable @xmath24 is simply related to @xmath25 , _",
    "b =( z-1 ) , where @xmath26 is the boost between the top rest frame in the lab frame ( we work to tree level and in the narrow width approximation ) .",
    "the distribution of @xmath24 is given by = ( 1-_b _ t ) + _ b _ t z in the collinear limit @xmath27 .",
    "this distribution is plotted in figure  [ fig : bdist ] for @xmath28 .",
    "exactly analogous distributions pertain for the reconstructed @xmath22 , interchanging the roles of positive and negative helicities .",
    "the distribution of the total @xmath29 of the @xmath15-jet has also been proposed as a polarimeter for highly boosted top quarks @xcite .     of the fraction of visible lab frame energy carried by the @xmath15-jet in a highly boosted hadronic top , @xmath30 ,",
    "plotted as a function of @xmath31 .",
    "the blue line ( weighted towards high values of @xmath24 ) is the distribution for a negative - helicity top quark ; the red line ( weighted towards low values of @xmath31 ) is the distribution for a positive - helicity top quark .",
    "[ fig : bdist],width=302 ]    in the highly relativistic limit , leptonic tops can be used to study polarization without any need for additional event reconstruction , as observables can be constructed which in the collinear limit are independent of the unknown boost between the top rest frame and the lab frame . collimated leptonic top quarks allow the energy of the lepton and the @xmath15-jet to be separately measured .",
    "the momentum fraction carried by the lepton provides a natural polarimeter .",
    "consider the observable u = , the fraction of the visible lab - frame energy carried by the lepton .",
    "this can be expressed in terms of top rest - frame quantities as    u = ,    where @xmath32 is the angle between the lepton momentum and the top direction of motion , @xmath33 is the lepton energy in the top rest frame , @xmath34 describes the orientation of the @xmath15-@xmath35 plane relative to the top direction of motion , and = is the angle between the lepton and the @xmath15 momenta in the @xmath15-@xmath35 plane . the ( unknown ) boost from the top rest frame to the lab frame",
    "is parameterized by @xmath26 , which we will henceforth take to unity . in these coordinates ,",
    "the matrix element for top decay is | |^ 2(m_t e_-2 e _",
    "^ 2 ) ( 1+_t _ ) , where again we take the axis of spin quantization to lie along the direction of top motion . the distribution of @xmath36",
    "can then be obtained from & & de_d _ d | |^ 2 ( _ t , e _ , _ ) + & & ( u - u ( e _ , _ , ) ) .",
    "we use the delta function to carry out the integral over @xmath34 , and evaluate the remaining integrals numerically .",
    "the resulting distributions for positive- and negative - helicity top quarks are plotted in figure  [ fig : udist ] .",
    "the distributions have a shoulder at u = = 0.215 , where @xmath37 is the minimum possible value of the lepton energy in the top rest frame . above this value of @xmath36 ,",
    "the integrand can receive contributions from multiple angular configurations as @xmath33 varies , while below this value of @xmath36 , only limited angular configurations can contribute .     of the fraction of visible lab frame energy carried by the lepton in a highly boosted leptonic top , @xmath38 , plotted as a function of @xmath36 .",
    "the blue curve ( peaked towards low values of @xmath39 ) is the distribution for a negative - helicity top quark ; the red curve ( weighted towards high values of @xmath36 ) is the distribution for a positive - helicity top quark .",
    "[ fig : udist],width=302 ]",
    "cascade decays of top partners to tops + missing energy are a prototypical example of the processes for which the above observables are well - suited . in this section",
    "we compute the polarization of top quarks produced from the decay of a top partner into a top quark and a boson partner , for both susy models ( where the boson partner is a neutralino ) and same - spin partner models ( where the boson partner is a massive vector boson ) .",
    "we work to tree level and in the narrow width approximation , and take the top quark to have standard model decays .",
    "the polarization @xmath40 is computed along the axis determined by the direction of the top motion in the parent rest frame , which is not directly observable ; in section  [ sec : assembly ] we will show how to relate this to the polarization @xmath41 along the axis determined by the direction of the top motion in the laboratory frame , which yields predictions for experimentally observable distributions .      consider the two - body decay of an on - shell stop squark @xmath42 into a top quark and a neutralino @xmath43 .",
    "the coupling for this process can be parameterized as @xmath44 where the yukawa couplings @xmath45 and @xmath46 are in general not equal .",
    "the top quark is thus produced with some nonzero polarization , the magnitude of which depends on ( 1 ) the masses of the particles in the decay chain and ( 2 ) the mixing of the stop squarks and the neutralinos .",
    "we take the axis of spin quantization to lie among the top direction of motion in the parent stop rest frame .",
    "the production amplitudes for positive and negative helicity top quarks depend on the following functions of the top and neutralino energy - momenta , @xmath47 where all quantities are to be evaluated in the stop rest frame .",
    "for this on - shell process , the top and neutralino energy - momenta are fixed in terms of the masses of the particles in the cascade .",
    "the functions @xmath48 result simply from explicit evaluation of the usual spinor wavefunction operators @xmath49 , @xmath50 on helicity eigenspinors .",
    "they measure the separate contributions of the two helicity states in the left- or right - handed fermion wave function .",
    "the matrix element to produce a positive ( negative)-helicity top quark is then the sum of the contributions from the left- and right - handed tops , @xmath51 for finite @xmath52 this gives , as expected , a nonvanishing amplitude for top quarks of both helicities even in the limit of a purely chiral vertex , @xmath53 or @xmath54 .",
    "we find the net polarization along the production axis to be the @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the mass of the initial squark .",
    "the net polarization @xmath40 arising from this cascade decay is plotted in the solid curves in figure  [ fig : avgp ] as a function of the masses of the stop squark and the neutralino . for simplicity",
    "we take purely chiral couplings ( @xmath57 ) in the figure , so the plotted polarization is an upper bound .",
    "we now consider the analogous decay chain in the case where the top partner @xmath58 has spin 1/2 and the vector boson partner @xmath59 has spin 1 .",
    "we parameterize this process by @xmath60 again , the couplings @xmath45 and @xmath46 are in general unequal and depend on the mixings of the top and vector boson partners . the computation is analogous to the one in the previous subsection , except",
    "now we must also average over the spins of the top partner @xmath61 and sum over the spins of the vector boson partner @xmath62 .",
    "we find the net degree of polarization along the production axis to be @xmath63 where all kinematic quantities ( @xmath64 ) are to be evaluated in the parent @xmath61 rest frame .",
    "a similar computation was carried out in @xcite for a benchmark model point .",
    "the net polarization @xmath40 arising from this cascade decay is plotted in the dashed curves in figure  [ fig : avgp ] as a function of the masses of the top partner and the vector boson partner .",
    "the kinematic suppression of the `` wrong '' polarization state is less for the fermion - fermion - vector interaction than it is for the fermion - fermion - scalar interaction .",
    "that is , for a given set of masses and couplings , the top polarization predicted by a same - spin cascade is less than that predicted by an opposite - spin cascade .",
    "this is due to the additional suppression of the `` wrong '' helicity contribution which comes from the spinor wave function of the neutralino in the opposite - spin cascades ; in the same - spin case , there is some kinematic suppression of the `` wrong '' helicity contributions coming from the longitudinal polarizations of the vector boson partner , but no suppression from the transverse polarizations .     as a function of parent particle mass @xmath65 in gev , plotted for purely chiral couplings ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "the red ( upper ) curves have a fixed boson partner mass of @xmath67 .",
    "the blue ( lower ) curves have a boson partner mass of @xmath68 .",
    "solid ( dashed ) lines plot the average polarization for opposite- ( same- ) spin partners .",
    "[ fig : avgp],width=302 ]",
    "in events where the top is reconstructed but the rest of the event is not , the natural axis for the top polarization is the top s direction of motion in the lab frame , which we will refer to as the detection axis .",
    "the most natural experimental observable for hadronic tops is then the angular distribution of the direction of the bottom jet ( or the less energetic light quark jet ) with respect to the top quark direction of motion in the top rest frame , @xmath69 the observed polarization is thus along the detection axis , @xmath70 . for highly boosted tops ,",
    "the natural polarization axis is again the top direction of motion .",
    "notice that there is no interference between the two top spin states , as the observables we consider are insensitive to rotations around the top direction of motion .    in order to relate the observed polarization to the polarization along the production axis @xmath40 computed in the previous section , we need to relate the two spin bases .",
    "the detected polarization @xmath71 is related to the production polarization @xmath40 by @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the angle between the production and detection axes in the top rest frame .",
    "this angle is the wigner angle determined by the composition of boosts @xmath74 from the top rest frame to the lab frame , followed by @xmath75 from the lab frame to the parent rest frame , and finally @xmath76 from the parent rest frame to the top rest frame , @xmath77 where @xmath78 are the representation matrices for the lorentz transformations @xcite . from this composition of boosts",
    "we find @xmath79 where @xmath80 are the energy and momentum of the top in the parent rest frame , @xmath81 is the angle of the top in the parent rest frame , and @xmath82 is the boost between the parent rest frame and the lab frame .",
    "the energy and momentum of the top are fixed by the masses of the particles in the decay .",
    "the phase space integration over @xmath83 can be carried out simply as ( after averaging over top partner and vector boson partner spins ) the matrix element is independent of @xmath83 .",
    "this leaves the boost @xmath82 between the parent rest frame and the lab frame . in the limit where the top partner is produced near threshold with little velocity in the lab frame , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , as there is little difference between the production and detection spin axes .",
    "the wigner angle is also lessened when the top quark is highly boosted in the top partner rest frame .",
    "thus , as expected , the maximal observable polarization signals are realized when the top partner is heavy and the vector boson partner is light .",
    "we plot @xmath86 as a function of @xmath82 in three different scenarios for the new particle masses in figure  [ fig : omega ] ( we integrate over @xmath87 ) .     for three different sets of new particle masses , as a function of parent top partner boost @xmath82 .",
    "the phase space integral over @xmath88 has been performed .",
    "the red ( central ) curve is for a top partner with mass @xmath89 and boson partner @xmath90 .",
    "the green ( upper ) curve is for a top partner with mass @xmath91 and boson partner @xmath92 .",
    "the blue ( lower ) curve is for a top partner with mass @xmath91 and boson partner @xmath93 .",
    "[ fig : omega],width=302 ]    for boosts @xmath94 , we find that the scenarios with a moderate to sizable mass splitting have @xmath95 or better ( the red and green curves shown in the figure ) , while in the case of heavy , degenerate standard model partners ( the blue curve ) the suppression is much larger , @xmath96 .",
    "for smaller boosts @xmath97 the situation is much better , with a suppression @xmath98 even for the heavy , degenerate scenario . in principle for a given model the distribution of boosts @xmath99 can be computed from the production dynamics and the pdfs , and the observable polarization is then given by @xmath100 allowing detailed quantitative predictions . in practice , for sufficiently heavy top partners ( and a sufficiently large mass splitting between the top partner and its daughter particles ) , the detailed boost distribution may not be necessary .",
    "top quarks produced in association with new physics can serve as an important window into the chiral structure of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "we have computed here the expected top polarization arising from a well - motivated class of events , namely on - shell cascade decays of a top partner into a top quark and a vector boson partner .",
    "observation of this signal constrains both the masses of the particles in the cascade and the chirality of the couplings .",
    "we have focused on variables which can be used in events which are not fully reconstructed . in the happy circumstance that the lhc reveals a rich spectrum of new particles with complicated cascade decays ,",
    "this strategy is likely to prove the cleanest way to assemble a large sample of inclusive top + new physics events , particularly if the new physics includes a stable invisible particle .",
    "we have discussed several angular distributions relevant for hadronic top quarks , and for collimated tops have constructed variables for both hadronic and leptonic decay modes and plotted their distributions .",
