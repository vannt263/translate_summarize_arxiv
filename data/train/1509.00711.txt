    "the graph of a triangulated sphere is generically @xmath0-rigid in the sense that any generic placement of the vertices in three - dimensional euclidean space determines a bar - joint framework which is continuously rigid .",

    "generalising this , fogelsanger @xcite has shown that a finite simple graph given by the @xmath2-skeleton of a triangulated compact surface without boundary is @xmath0-rigid .",
    "the proof uses combinatorial edge contraction reduction of the graph together with the fact that @xmath0-rigidity is preserved by the inverse moves of vertex splitting .",
    "the methods also extend to higher dimensions . however , with the exception of the sphere the triangulated surface graphs are over - constrained , in the sense that @xmath3 , and so it is natural to seek a combinatorial characterisation of minimal @xmath0-rigidity for the graphs of compact surfaces with boundaries .",
    "we obtain such a characterisation here for graphs derived from torus graphs by the excision of the interior edges of a triangulated disc .",
    "the precise definition of these graphs is given in section [ s : surfacegraphs ] .",
    "we make use of new methods , some of which have also been useful for modified triangulated spheres with holes and blocks @xcite .",
    "in particular we represent graphs in terms of _ face graphs _ , which here are planar graphs with certain boundary vertices and edges identified , and we consider reductions through edge contraction homotopy and division over critical separating cycles .",
    "however , in view of the toroidal topology there are a number of new considerations .",
    "in particular , edge cycles need not separate the graph and the boundary of the hole may be improper with subpaths wrapping around the torus with nontrivial homology .",
    "in fact for the minimally @xmath0-rigid graphs there are @xmath4 forms of hole boundary associated with which there are @xmath4 forms of critical separating cycle .",
    "in addition we give a detailed analysis of small torus with hole graphs which have at most @xmath5 vertices and which in fact display all of these boundary types .",
    "the main theorem may be stated as follows .",

    "its sufficiency here is a more subtle issue than in the case of the generic cauchy theorem .",
    "for example , the substitution of a triangulated subdisc by a triangulated disc with the same boundary need not preserve @xmath7-tightness .",
    "also we note that there are torus graphs with two holes which are @xmath7-tight and generically flexible .    the rest of the paper",

    "we define _ critical separating cycles _ and associated _ fission moves _ within the class @xmath9 . exploiting the toroidal facial structure of the graphs in @xmath9 we obtain a key lemma , lemma [ l : toruskey ] , which shows that if the contraction of an edge @xmath10 preserves the simplicity of the graph but violates the @xmath7-tight sparsity count then there exists a critical separating cycle through @xmath10 . in this case",
    "an associated fission move @xmath11 is possible , which leads to a pair of strictly smaller graphs in @xmath9 if @xmath12 .",
    "it follows that there is a contraction - fission reduction scheme to a certain family of small graphs in @xmath9 with no more than @xmath5 vertices .",

    "the inverse move for edge contraction is a vertex splitting move , which is known to preserve @xmath0-rigidity ( whiteley @xcite ) .",
    "also the inverse fission moves , or fusion moves , correspond to rigid subgraph substitutions preserving @xmath0-rigidity , and so the equivalence of ( i ) and ( ii ) follows .",
    "in section 6 we give an alternative proof of this equivalence which is more direct .",
    "the proof is based on ( i ) a nested application of the key lemma , in order to identify a contractible edge whose contraction preserves membership in @xmath9 , and ( ii ) an analysis of the graphs of @xmath9 which are not contractible in this manner .",
    "we show , moreover , that there are @xmath13 such uncontractible graphs ( see theorem [ t : theirreducibles ] ) and that each graph in @xmath9 is constructible from ( at least ) one of these two graphs by a sequence of vertex splitting moves .",

    "we may assume that every crossover edge is not on a critical cycle .",
    "however , we now show that this is not possible , completing the proof .    consider a single pair of internal edges , @xmath352 on one of the panel graphs .",
    "these edges and their panel subgraph are illustrated in figure [ f : irreducibleproof ] .",

    "we may assume , moreover , that the edge @xmath10 does not lie on a nonfacial @xmath0-cycle . to see this we note the two possibilities that hold if @xmath10 does lie on a nonfacial @xmath0-cycle .",

    "such graphs have edges which are of @xmath164 type and do not lie on a nonfacial @xmath0-cycle , and so we may rechoose @xmath10 to be such an edge .",
    "since the annular graph contains an edge of @xmath164 type which is not on a nonfacial @xmath0-cycle we may either contract with this edge to a smaller graph in @xmath9 or , by the critical cycle lemma , obtain another proper critical cycle , @xmath265 say , and an associated division @xmath358 with @xmath359 , where these graphs have fewer vertices than @xmath6 .",
    "note that we can assume that @xmath265 lies inside @xmath260 , or , more precisely , that the detached triangulated disc for @xmath265 is contained in the detached triangulated disc for @xmath260 .",
    "one way to see this is to note that the union @xmath360 of @xmath166 and @xmath76 is a proper subgraph of @xmath6 which lies in @xmath9 .",
    "thus we may replace @xmath265 by the proper critical cycle for the detachment map for @xmath360 . by the reasoning above",
    "there is a contractible edge in the associated annular graph which does not lie on a nonfacial @xmath0-cycle .    repeating this process , identifying nested critical cycles @xmath361",
    ", we must eventually obtain a contractible edge for which the contracted graph lies in @xmath9 .",
    "indeed , if this did not occur then the process provides an infinite strictly increasing sequence of proper subgraphs of @xmath6 and this contradicts the finiteness of the graph .",
    "we have shown that the uncontractible graphs in @xmath9 are @xmath0-rigid by the analysis in sections 4 and 5 .",
    "this , together with lemma [ l : contractionkey ] provides a second proof of the equivalence of ( i ) and ( ii ) in the main theorem , which avoids the use of fission moves .",
    "note first that @xmath159 and @xmath161 are uncontractible .",
    "also it is straightforward to check , with the assistance of lemmas [ l : degree3notcrit ] and [ l : notoncritordegree3exists ] , that the particular graphs @xmath362 are contractible in @xmath9 , and indeed , are completely contractible to one of these two graphs .",
    "however , it remains to check that every graph with no interior vertices and one of these boundary types is similarly contractible . to see that this is so we now argue in a somewhat ad hoc case - by - case manner .",
    "the arguments become progressively simpler as the number of vertices decreases .",
    "the @xmath283 case , corresponding to the detachment map @xmath363 is covered by lemma [ l:9vhas_stronglyinterior ] .",

    "the two paths from @xmath289 to @xmath42 in the diagram represent a single path , @xmath182 say , in @xmath21 ( and do not necessarily indicate a subpath of edges ) .",
    "the remaining embedded edges of @xmath6 are representable by paths in the region @xmath45 which may pass across @xmath182 a number of times .",
    "the degree of vertices being at least @xmath106 is indicated on the diagram by two emerging edge paths .",
    "since there are @xmath5 crossover edges in total , there will be two further emerging directions , but we need not indicate this . for @xmath341 and @xmath43 these paths must emerge properly into the open rectangle region @xmath45 within the outer boundaries .",
    "the vertex @xmath42 also has at least @xmath2 emerging edge but in this case there are different possibilities in the embedded representation for emergence since the embedded edge may also start at the right hand vertices labelled @xmath42 .",

    "suppose first that the crossover edge @xmath369 exists .",
    "we know that it does not lie on a critical cycle , by lemma [ l : notoncritordegree3exists ] .",
