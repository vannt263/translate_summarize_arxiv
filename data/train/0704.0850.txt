    "the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg xxz chain is one of the most fundamental models for one - dimensional quantum magnetism , which is given by the hamiltonian @xmath1 where @xmath2 with @xmath3 being the pauli matrices acting on the @xmath4-th site and @xmath5 is the anisotropy parameter . for @xmath6",
    ", it is called the massive xxz model where the system is gapful .",
    "meanwhile for @xmath7 case , the system is gapless and called the massless xxz model . especially we call it xxx model for the isotropic case @xmath8 .    the exact eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this model can be obtained by the bethe ansatz method @xcite .",
    "many physical quantities in the thermodynamic limit such as specific heat , magnetic susceptibility , elementary excitations , etc ... , can be exactly evaluated even at finite temperature by the bethe ansatz method @xcite .",
    "the exact calculation of the correlation functions , however , is still a difficult problem .",
    "the exceptional case is @xmath9 , where the system reduces to a lattice free - fermion model by the jordan - wigner transformation . in this case",
    ", we can calculate arbitrary correlation functions by means of wick s theorem @xcite .",
    "recently , however , there have been rapid developments in the exact evaluations of correlation functions for @xmath10 case also , since kyoto group ( jimbo , miki , miwa , nakayashiki ) derived a multiple integral representation for arbitrary correlation functions .",
    "using the representation theory of the quantum affine algebra @xmath11 , they first derived a multiple integral representation for massive xxz antiferromagnetic chain in 1992 @xcite , which is before long extended to the xxx case @xcite and the massless xxz case @xcite .",
    "later the same integral representations were reproduced by kitanine , maillet , terras @xcite in the framework of quantum inverse scattering method .",
    "they have also succeeded in generalizing the integral representations to the xxz model with an external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "more recently the multiple integral formulas were extended to dynamical correlation functions as well as finite temperature correlation functions @xcite . in this way",
    "it has been established now the correlation functions for xxz model are represented by multiple integrals in general .",
    "however , these multiple integrals are difficult to evaluate both numerically and analytically .    for general anisotropy @xmath5",
    ", it has been shown that the multiple inetegrals up to four - dimension can be reduced to one - dimensional integrals @xcite . as a result",
    "all the density matrix elements within _ four _ lattice sites have been obtained for general anisotropy @xcite . to reduce the multiple integrals into one - dimension ,",
    "however , involves hard calculation , which makes difficult to obtain correlation functions on more than four lattice sites . on the other hand , at the isotropic point @xmath8 ,",
    "an algebraic method based on qkz equation has been devised @xcite and all the density matrix elements up to _ six _ lattice sites have been obtained @xcite . moreover , as for the spin - spin correlation functions , up to seventh - neighbour correlation @xmath12 for xxx chain have been obtained from the generating functional approach @xcite .",
    "it is desirable that this algebraic method will be generalized to the case with @xmath13 .",
    "actually , boos , jimbo , miwa , smirnov and takeyama have derived an exponential formula for the density matrix elements of xxz model , which does not contain multiple integrals @xcite .",
    "it , however , seems still hard to evaluate the formula for general density matrix elements . among the general @xmath14",
    ", there is a special point @xmath0 , where some intriguing properties have been observed .",
    "let us define a correlation function called emptiness formation probability ( efp ) @xcite which signifies the probability to find a ferromagnetic string of length @xmath15 : @xmath16 the explicit general formula for @xmath17 at @xmath0 was conjectured in @xcite @xmath18 which is proportional to the number of alternating sign matrix of size @xmath19 .",
    "later this conjecture was proved by the explicit evaluation of the multiple integral representing the efp @xcite .",
    "remarkably , one can also obtain the exact asymptotic behavior as @xmath20 from this formula , which is the unique valuable example except for the free fermion point @xmath21 .",
    "note also that as for the longitudinal two - point correlation functions at @xmath0 , up to eighth - neighbour correlation function @xmath22 have been obtained in @xcite by use of the multiple integral representation for the generating function .",
    "most outstanding is that all the results are represented by single rational numbers .",
    "these results motivated us to calculate other correlation functions at @xmath0 .",
    "actually we have obtained all the density matrix elements up to _ six _ lattice sites by the direct evaluation of the multiple integrals .",
    "all the results can be written by single rational numbers as expected .",
    "a direct evaluation of the multiple integrals is possible due to the particularity of the case for @xmath0 as is explained below .",
