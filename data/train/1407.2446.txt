    "this event can be explained by the fact that the dark energy ( [ desibling ] ) , which is responsible for the current accelerated expansion of the universe , decreases with the expansion until it reaches a vanishing value when @xmath63 and where @xmath64 can be neglected . at this time",
    "the universe bounce starting its contraction , this contraction becomes more and more violent .",
    "indeed the deceleration parameter ( [ defdecceleration ] ) which is currently roughly of the order @xmath65 can be approximated around the bounce as : @xmath66consequently , the deceleration parameter increases with the accelerated expansion and becomes less negative in the future until vanishing at @xmath67 @xmath68 , which correspond to @xmath69 , and where @xmath50 changes its sign .",
    "afterwards @xmath70 the universe enters a phase of decelerated expansion and the deceleration parameter gets increasingly positive until it diverges at the bounce , i.e. at @xmath71 or at @xmath72 . for @xmath73 ,",

    "the contraction of the universe is decelerated . for @xmath75",
    "the deceleration parameter becomes more and more negative converging to @xmath39 which correspond to an accelerated contraction .",
    "this accelerated contraction is promoted by the exponential growth of the density of matter which becomes increasingly important , in this situation the asymptotic behaviour of the friedmann equation ( [ friedmannfuture ] ) is no longer valid .",
    "consequently , the competition on the dynamics of the universe between dark energy and cold dark matter leads to a situation similar to our recent past or present where the modified friedmann equation can be approximated by eq .",
    "( [ friedmannpast ] ) which gives the solution ( [ solfriedmannpast ] ) but in this case in a contracting way .",
    "the consideration of a dark fluid ; i.e. a dark energy component , given by equation ( [ eqstate ] ) has a clear motivation coming from the recently formulated quantum version of the energy conditions @xcite , although its behaviour in relation to these conditions is not at all trivial as we will show in this section .",
    "let us start summarising the linear point - like energy conditions . as is well known these conditions are not fundamental physics @xcite ; however , they are useful to characterise the kind of fluid we are dealing with . these conditions are @xcite :    * strong energy condition ( sec ) : gravity should always be attractive . in a cosmological scenario",
    "implies @xmath76 * dominant energy condition ( dec ) : the energy density measured by any observer should be non - negative and propagate in a causal way , which leads to @xmath77 * weak energy condition ( wec ) : the energy density measured by any observer should be non - negative @xmath78 * null energy condition ( nec ) : a minimum requirement which is implied by sec and wec , is @xmath79 therefore , its violation implies that none of the mentioned energy conditions are satisfied .",
    "the sec is known to be violated in classical scenarios @xcite and in particular it has to be violated in an accelerating universe like the primordial inflationary phase or the current one .",
    "moreover , violations of all these conditions are known when considering quantum effects @xcite .",
    "thus , non - linear constraints on the stress - energy tensor have been introduced recently in the literature @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that they behave better in the presence of semi - classical quantum effects , although the potential physical interpretation of some of these conditions is not so clear as those of their linear counterparts @xcite . these non - linear conditions are @xcite :    * flux energy condition ( fec ) : the energy density measured by any observer should propagate in a causal way ( without imposing any restriction on its value ) .",
    "this leads to @xcite @xmath80 in a cosmological scenario .",

    "moreover , the quantum version of these non - linear energy conditions seem to be satisfied even for quantum vacuum states . due to its interesting interpretation",
    "the quantum version of the fec is of particular relevance .",
    "this is @xcite    * quantum flux energy condition ( qfec ) : the energy should either propagate in a causal way or have associated a flux vector with a norm bounded from above by a quantity depending on the characteristics of the system under consideration ( a characteristics distance of the system @xmath83 and the system 4-velocity @xmath84 ) . in a cosmological scenario it would be natural to consider @xmath85 ; thus , this condition is expressed as @xcite @xmath86 with @xmath87    as it has been pointed out in ref .",
    ", a similar quantum formulation of the linear energy conditions would not be so widely satisfied when considering semi - classical quantum effects ( although they could be fulfilled in some situations where their classical counterparts are violated , for example , for the casimir vacuum @xcite ) .",
    "a quantum version of the wec has been specifically formulated as @xcite    * quantum weak energy condition ( qwec ) : the energy density measured by any observer should not be excessively negative , which in a cosmological scenario would lead to @xmath88    as the total energy density of the model presented in the previous section , @xmath89 , should always be positive to have a well defined hubble parameter , the total content of the universe we are considering could satisfy the qwec for small enough values of the parameter @xmath7 , as one may have @xmath90 moreover , one could use these quantum conditions to quantify how much the classical energy conditions are violated .",
    "therefore , the dark energy of this paper could be interpreted as a fluid which violates the nec `` minimally '' if @xmath7 is small enough .",
    "it must be noted that a covariant formulation of the quantum nec in the way of the qwec introduced in ref .",
    "is not possible ( due to an arbitrariness in a normalisation factor ) ; however , once the nec is formulated for a particular stress - energy tensor ( as it is done in ( [ nec ] ) ) a natural idea of what is a minimal violation could be considered taking the inequality on the right in ( [ qwec ] ) .      from the equation of state ( [ eqstate ] ) ,",
    "it is clear that this fluid violates the wec and the nec .",
    "as it has already been mentioned the dark fluid of this cosmological model has a negative energy density in the past history of the universe , where it is a sub - dominant component .",
    "taking into account ( [ w ] ) , it can be concluded that the sec ( [ sec ] ) associated with the dark fluid is violated when @xmath92 ; nevertheless , it can be fulfilled at early cosmological epochs when @xmath93 since using equation ( [ desibling ] ) we have @xmath94 the qwec could be satisfied in the present and future evolution of the universe only for very small departures with respect a cosmological constant . taking into account expressions ( [ qwec ] ) and ( [ epsilon ] )",
    ", the qwec would be fulfilled if @xmath95 on the other hand , one can consider the non - linear energy conditions .",
    "taking into account the equation of state ( [ eqstate ] ) , one can express @xmath96 in terms of @xmath2 and simplify the fec ( [ fec ] ) to @xmath97 thus , the fec was only satisfied when the dark component was sub - dominant , in the early universe .",
    "one can conclude that something similar happens with the detec ( [ detec ] ) , since it can be fulfilled only if @xmath98 . in view of equation ( [ w ] ) , this is only possible for @xmath99 moreover , taking again into account ( [ eqstate ] ) , one can simplify the qfec ( [ qfec ] ) to @xmath100 thus , if the right hand side ( r.  h.  s. )  of this inequality is positive , the qfec associated with the dark fluid would be satisfied for any negative value of @xmath2 , and for small values of the energy density . taking the value given in ( [ epsilon ] ) this implies @xmath101 .",
    "moreover , the smaller is the value of @xmath7 , the larger would be the region where the qfec is satisfied , being infinitely large for the cosmological constant case @xmath102 as it should be expected .      in this case",
    "the dark fluid is always characterised by a positive energy density and the equation of state fixes @xmath104 therefore , the nec and wec are clearly satisfied and , therefore , the qwec . for the sec to be satisfied one would need @xmath105 where @xmath106 corresponds to the scale factor at the bounce ( cf .",
    "ii ) thus , it would generically be satisfied when the dark component dominates the evolution . moreover , as in this case @xmath107 , then the fec ( [ fec ] ) can be reduce to the dec ( [ dec ] )",
    ". both of them are satisfied for @xmath108 that is , these conditions are violated for @xmath109 , which implies @xmath110 with @xmath111 the violation of these energy conditions close to the bounce could be understood considering that a bounce may imply a change on the direction of the cosmological arrow of time @xcite . therefore , a condition which is based on requiring a causal flux would not be suitably well defined close to this direction flip . on the other hand , the qfec would be satisfied in a larger region of the cosmological evolution given by @xmath112 thus , the qfec associated with the dark fluid would be satisfied during the whole cosmological evolution if @xmath113 , where the r.  h.  s.  of equation ( [ qfec3 ] ) is negative , and would be violated close to the bounce otherwise . finally , the detec is satisfied in this model only for @xmath114 thus , it is satisfied in the region close to the bound where this fluid dominates the cosmological dynamics . in table",
    "[ energycondition ] we summarise fulfilment / violation of the different energy conditions .",
    "it can be seen that for a fluid with an equation of state with a value of @xmath115 small enough , that is for a slight departure from the cosmological constant case , the qfec is violated only in the far future for the phantom model , whereas it can be satisfied even at the bounce for the dark model .",
    "this behaviour is reinforcing suggestions of an important role of the qfec @xcite , as one could think that the singular behaviour of the phantom fluid at infinity is only possible because the qfec is violated there .",
    "moreover , one could also argue that fluids characterized by large positive values of @xmath7 would not satisfy the qfec because the singular behaviour could be felt earlier in the physics of the universe , as we will see in the next section .",
    "on the other hand , as was already pointed out in ref .  , the quantum linear energy conditions do nt seem to have the relevance of their non - linear counterparts , as the qwec could be fulfilled even when the universe is in a singular state .",
    "in this section , we will study the effects of the accelerated expansion of the universe , as described in sect .",
    "ii , on local bound systems .",
    "more precisely , we will consider a spherical newtonian object with mass @xmath116 and a test particle rotating around it in circular orbit ( initially ) with a physical radius @xmath117 , and assume that both objects are embedded in a spherically symmetric flrw background . in refs .",
    ", the authors have shown that bound systems with a strong enough coupling in a de sitter background will not comove with the accelerating expansion of the universe .",
    "however it is not the case when general accelerating phases are considered .",

    ", we would like to stress that the analysis we have carried out and which is based on the evolution equation ( [ eqmotion2 ] ) is valid within a newtonian approximation and under a weak field limit as clearly stated in ref . .",
    "on the other hand , there are many choices of metrics one can use to interpolate between a schwarzschild and a flrw metric ( cf . ref . ) .",
    "the results we have obtained may be improved if a better interpolating metric is chosen .",
    "however , we expect the approximation in equation ( [ metric ] ) to be still valid as the universe approaches the little sibling of the big rip because the matter part ( the terms proportional to @xmath173 in the evolution equation of the bound structure ) is small as compared with the expansion terms within such conditions .",
    "therefore , the use of the evolution equation ( [ eqmotion ] ) is quite fair in our analysis .",
    "we present a dark energy model which deviates slightly from the @xmath11cdm at present , cf .",
    "( [ eqstate ] ) .",
    "its energy density has a logarithmic correction of the scale factor as compared with a pure cosmological constant , such that its influence on the past of the universe is negligible in comparison with the other matter components of the universe . at present",
    "it behaves like a cosmological constant . however , its future behaviour is drastically different from that found on a @xmath11cdm .",
    "in fact , the universe would be no longer asymptotically de sitter as in the @xmath0cdm scenario but would face what we named the little sibling of the big rip if @xmath7 is positive ( see eq .",
    "( [ eqstate ] ) ) . at this event the hubble rate and",
    "the scale factor blow up but the cosmic derivative of the hubble rate does not .",
    "this abrupt event takes place at an infinite cosmic time where the scalar curvature explodes .",
    "we use the nomenclature of the little sibling of the big rip because ( i ) the hubble rate diverges like in the big rip singularity and ( ii ) it takes the universe an infinite cosmic time to reach the event like what happens with the little rip event .",
    "we have as well analysed the outcome of bound structure in the universe if its doomsday would corresponds to a little sibling of the big rip .",
    "it turns out that even though the event seems to be harmless as it takes place in the infinite future , the bound structures in the universe would be unavoidably destroyed on a finite cosmic time from now ( cf .",
    "table  [ dissociationtime ] ) .",
    "in addition , we expect that a possible way to smooth the abrupt event corresponding to the little sibling of the big rip singularity could be through the inclusion of ultra - violet and infra - red modification of general relativity as the event happens in the future and at very high energies @xcite .    in order to complete our analysis ,",
    "we have also shown that a universe with a negative value of @xmath7 bounces in its future .",
    "the smaller is the dimensionless energy density @xmath49 , quantifying the deviation of the dark energy model ( [ eqstate ] ) from a cosmological constant , the latter would the bounce take place .",
    "we have as well given a clear motivation for considering this model from the point of view of the energy conditions , since the resulting cosmological model violates the wec only in a controlled way even in the phantom dominated future expansion , therefore , satisfying the qwec . a deeper consideration of",
    "this fact could lead us to doubt about the utility of the qwec ( see also ref . ) , as we have proven that this condition can be satisfied even when a singular event takes place . on the other hand ,",
    "the qfec is violated only close to the singularity for small enough values of @xmath7 ( that is , for large enough @xmath153 ) , where the universe suffers the singular effects .",
    "this interesting behaviour could be suggesting that a more fundamental theory able to resolve singularities could be compatible with ( or it may even imply ) the qfec .",
    "moreover , the fact that this conditions can be satisfied at the turnaround of the model with @xmath103 for small values of @xmath115 , it is only confirming the weaker character of this kind of events , which are not expected to be smoothed by quantum effects .",
