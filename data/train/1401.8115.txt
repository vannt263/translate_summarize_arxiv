    "nowadays , digital images of different phenomena of interest are commonly observed in almost every experimental fields , however , their subsequent post - processing and use tend to be very simple .",
    "the information from each image is frequently resumed in just a few numbers , and simple statistical procedures such as hypothesis testing or parameter estimation procedures are applied to them . in this paper",
    "we will work with binary images of random clumps .",
    "stochastic - geometric models and in particular random closed sets @xcite have been broadly used to model irregular random patterns in various fields , such as communication networks @xcite , materials science @xcite or physics @xcite among others .",
    "they have also been useful in modeling many medical and biological problems , especially those which require the extraction of information from microscopic images .",
    "thus , boolean models in particular and germ - grain models in general have been extensively used to analyze binary images of random clumps in many scientific fields @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be the class of closed subsets in the euclidean space @xmath1 and @xmath2 compact subset of @xmath3 where @xmath4 or equivalently the borel @xmath5-algebra generated by the the fell topology on @xmath0 @xcite . if @xmath6 denotes a probability measure in @xmath7 then , according with the original definition given by @xcite",
    ", @xmath8 is a random closed set .",
    "the germ - grain model @xcite is a particular class of random closed set model that has proved to be suitable for working with images formed by random clumps .",
    "its mathematical definition is as follows :    [ def germ - grain model ] let @xmath9\\}$ ] be a marked point process , where @xmath10 are points of @xmath1 and @xmath11 are compact subsets of @xmath1 .",
    "a germ - grain model , @xmath12 , is defined as : @xmath13 the points @xmath10 are called _ germs _ and the sets @xmath14 are known as _ _ grains__@xcite .    the most widely known and used germ - grain model is the boolean model @xcite .",
    "the boolean model is obtained when the germ process , @xmath15 , is a poisson process with intensity function @xmath16 and the grains , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , are i.i.d . and independent of the germs .    under homogeneity",
    ", the intensity of the poisson germs process is assumed to be constant , and it is denoted by @xmath21 . additionally , if @xmath12 is stationary , i.e. if @xmath12 and the translated sets @xmath22 have the same distribution @xmath23 , the _ typical grain _ , @xmath17 , can be defined as a closed random set with the same distribution as the sets @xmath24 but independent , both of them and of the germs .",
    "so , the distribution of the _ typical _ grain is the distribution of the marks of the marked point process @xmath25 .",
    "this is a marked point process on @xmath26 , with the marks @xmath11 , @xmath27 , being random convex bodies in @xmath26 .",
    "it is a distribution on the space @xmath28 of compacts sets .",
    "the probability distribution of a random closed set @xmath12 is given by its _ capacity functional _",
    ", @xmath29 , defined as : @xmath30    useful summary descriptions of the probability distribution of the random closed set are the coverage function , @xmath31 , defined as the mean area of @xmath12 in the unit square centered in @xmath32 , i.e. @xmath33 , and the covariance function @xmath34 .",
    "these functions describe the first - order and the second - order structure of the set respectively .    under stationarity",
    "the coverage function is constant , @xmath35 , and is called volume fraction and @xmath36 @xmath23 . in this case , the k - function @xcite provides a more intuitive and practical way to describe the second order structure .",
    "it is defined as : @xmath37,\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the ball centered at the origin with radius @xmath39 ; @xmath40 is the lebesgue measure and @xmath41 denotes the expectation with respect to the palm distribution of @xmath12 .",
    "when @xmath42 , the origin of @xmath43 is chosen as the typical point of @xmath12 , @xmath44 becomes the average measure of the intersection of @xmath12 with a ball of radius @xmath39 centered at @xmath42 .",
    "we have the following relation between the covariance and the @xmath45-function : @xmath46    the @xmath45-function , also called the ripley @xmath45-function , has been extensively used in the point processes literature @xcite mainly to analyze the strength of the interaction between points in the point process .",
    "however , it has also been used to analyze isotropic boolean models @xcite . additionally , @xcite proposed an approximation for the k - function in overlapping boolean models based on an approximation of the covariogram of the primary grain .",
    "originally , the k - function was defined to characterize stationary point processes , but the definition was later extended to inhomogeneous point processes @xcite .",
    "as far as we know , it has not yet been extended to non - stationary germ - grain models .",
    "this is our objective in this paper .",
    "the assumptions of stationarity and isotropy facilitate the estimation of the parameters of the germ - grain model .",
    "however , the hypothesis of spatial homogeneity frequently fails when real data sets are analysed .",
    "an importante example of non stationary germ - grain model is the non - homogeneous boolean model , i.e. the boolean model obtained when the germ process is a poisson process with intensity function @xmath16 .",
    "non - homogeneous boolean models have been used to model functionally graded materials @xcite , distributions of galaxies @xcite and complex fluids @xcite . methods to estimate parameters of non - homogeneous boolean models have been studied by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "from now on we will restrict our work to the case @xmath47 .    to define the inhomogeneous k - function for point patterns , @xcite considered a point process @xmath48 in @xmath49 , with first - order intensity function @xmath50 .",
    "given @xmath51 the class of bounded borel sets in @xmath49 , and assuming that the function @xmath52 is finite for all @xmath53 , they defined @xmath48 as a second - order intensity reweighted stationary point process if @xmath54 , being @xmath55 the translation of @xmath56 by the vector x. from this point , they defined the inhomogeneous k - function for point processes as :    [ inhomogeneous k - function for point processes ] [ def inhomogeneous k - function ] let @xmath48 be a second - order intensity reweighted stationary point process .",
    "then , the inhomogeneous k - function of @xmath48 is defined as : @xmath57 for any @xmath58 , the class of bounded borel sets in @xmath49 , where @xmath59 denotes the indicator function , @xmath60 is the area ( lebesgue measure ) of @xmath61 , , and @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",
    "this expression does not depend on the choice of @xmath61 .",
    "given a realization of @xmath48 in an observation window @xmath61 , its corresponding sample estimator @xcite becomes :    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is an edge corrector function and @xmath66 , where @xmath67 denotes the boundary of @xmath68 .",
    "as stated below , the inhomogeneous k - function has been defined to work with inhomogeneous point processes @xcite , and our aim is to extended it for non - stationary germ - grain models .",
    "we have to note that there is an important difference between point processes and germ grain models .",
    "the probability distribution of a point process is characterized by its random count measure , but the random coverage measure of a random closed set does not characterize its probability distribution .",
    "( @xcite ) , establish a sufficient condition to guarantee that the random coverage measure determine the probability distribution of the random closed set .",
    "previously to define the inhomogeneous k - function , the following fundamental concept must be introduced .    assuming that @xmath12 has a strictly positive coverage function , i.e. @xmath69 @xmath70 , given @xmath56 , @xmath71 bounded borel sets in @xmath72 , the measure @xmath73 is defined in @xmath74 as : @xmath75    the germ - grain model @xmath12 is `` second - order intensity - reweighted stationary '' if @xmath76 for all @xmath77    a second - order stationary germ - grain model is also second - order intensity - reweighted stationary .",
    "a non - homogeneous boolean model is second - order intensity - reweighted stationary because of the second - order intensity - reweighted stationary property of its germ process and the independence of the grains .",

    "@xmath84 has an interpretation as a palm expectation , similar to that for the stationary case :    @xmath85    where @xmath86 denotes the expectation with respect to the palm distribution @xmath87 of @xmath12 at @xmath88 that can be interpreted as the conditional distribution of @xmath12 given that @xmath89 .",

    "given a realization of @xmath12 in an observation window @xmath61 its corresponding sample estimator is    @xmath94    with @xmath65 an edge corrector function , and @xmath95 , as above , @xmath96 is a kernel estimator of the coverage function , and @xmath97 denotes the numerical approximation .",
    "figure [ ejemplokt ] shows realizations of three different germ - grain models and the mean of the estimated inhomogeneous k - function computed from a sample of them .",
    "it can be seen that for @xmath39 @xmath98 , @xmath99 is greater for the cluster model than for the boolean model , which is due to the effect of the clustering of germs . for @xmath39",
    "@xmath100 it also increases much faster but for larger @xmath39-values the increase in @xmath99 for the cluster model is slower than for the boolean model .",
    "finally , for @xmath39 @xmath101 , @xmath99 is lower for the cluster model than for the boolean model .    as @xcite state , in practice it is difficult to make a distinction between large - scale variation given by @xmath31 and variation due to interactions . in this case",
    "it is of particular importance the choice of the bandwidth parameter in the kernel estimator of the coverage function ( eq . [ kin3 ] ) . in our experiments , we choose it comparing the value of the analytical expression of the volume fraction of an homogeneous boolean model , with the empirical one for different values of @xmath102 . on the other hand , taking into account that the theoretical volume fraction in the cluster model is constant we choose the greatest @xmath102 value among those that provided a good approximation .",
    "this choice of @xmath102 allows to distinguish clearly the @xmath99 for the non - homogeneous boolean model and the cluster model , as can be seen in figure [ ejemplokt ] ( d ) .",
    "it is due to the fact that the estimation of the coverage function in the `` accumulation '' area of the non - homogeneous boolean model is quite greater than the corresponding to the cluster model .    [",
