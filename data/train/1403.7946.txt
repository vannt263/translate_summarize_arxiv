    "matsumoto @xcite proved that every lefschetz fibration of genus one over a closed oriented surface is isomorphic to a fiber sum of copies of a holomorphic elliptic fibration on @xmath1 and a trivial torus bundle over the surface if it has at least one critical point .",
    "this result played a crucial role in completing the classification of diffeomorphism types of elliptic surfaces ( see gompf and stipsicz ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 8.3 ) ) .",
    "although such a classification has not been established for lefschetz fibrations of higher genus , auroux @xcite proved a stabilization theorem for lefschetz fibrations of genus two , which states that every lefschetz fibration of genus two over the @xmath0sphere becomes isomorphic to a fiber sum of copies of three typical fibrations after fiber summing with a holomorphic fibration on @xmath2 .",
    "auroux @xcite gave a generalization of this theorem for lefschetz fibrations of higher genus , which states that two lefschetz fibrations of the same genus over the @xmath0sphere which have the same signature , the same numbers of singular fibers of each type , and admit sections of the same self - intersection number become isomorphic after fiber summing the same number of copies of a ` universal ' lefschetz fibration .",
    "kamada @xcite introduced charts , which are labeled finite graphs in a disk , to describe monodromies of surface braids ( see also a textbook @xcite of kamada ) .",
    "kamada , matsumoto , matumoto , and waki @xcite considered a variant of chart for lefschetz fibrations of genus one to give a remarkably simple proof of the above result of matsumoto .",
    "furthermore kamada @xcite , and endo and kamada @xcite made use of generalized charts to give a simple proof of the above theorem of auroux for lefschetz fibrations of genus two , and to investigate a stabilization theorem and an invariant for hyperelliptic lefschetz fibrations of arbitrary genus .",

    "we introduce a chart description for lefschetz fibrations of genus greater than two over closed oriented surfaces of arbitrary genus to show a signature formula and two theorems on stabilization for such fibrations . in section 2",
    "we introduce charts and chart moves with respect to wajnryb s presentation of mapping class groups to examine monodromies of lefschetz fibrations . after a short survey of meyer s signature cocycle",
    ", we generalize a signature formula @xcite of endo and nagami for lefschetz fibrations over the @xmath0sphere to that for lefschetz fibrations over a closed oriented surface of arbitrary genus in section 3 .",
    "section 4 is devoted to proofs of two theorems on stabilization of lefschetz fibrations under fiber summing with copies of a ` universal ' lefschetz fibration .",
    "in particular the first of our stabilization theorems is a generalization of the theorem of auroux @xcite .",

    "it would be worth considering compositions of monodromy representations with appropriate homomorphisms and charts corresponding to the compositions .",
    "for example , hasegawa @xcite adopted a homomorphism from the @xmath491string braid group @xmath492 to the semi - direct product @xmath493 , while endo and kamada @xcite used a standard epimorphism from the hyperelliptic mapping class group of a closed oriented surface of genus @xmath4 to the mapping class group of a sphere with @xmath494 marked points .",
    "theorem [ main1 ] and theorem [ main2 ] tell us that the numbers of singular fibers of all types and the signature of the total space completely determine the stable isomorphism class of a lefschetz fibration with given base and fiber .",
    "thus any numerical invariant of lefschetz fibrations which is additive under fiber sum is determined by these invariants in principle .",
    "nosaka @xcite has recently defined an invariant which is not additive under fiber sum .",
    "non - numerical invariants such as monodromy group would be also useful ( see matsumoto @xcite and park and yun @xcite ) .",
