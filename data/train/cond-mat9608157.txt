    "the theory of ternary amphiphilic systems has developed rapidly during the last few years @xcite . for long - chain amphiphiles",
    "the molecular solubility is very small , so that essentially all amphiphilic molecules are located in monolayers at the interface between oil and water . in this long - chain limit ,",
    "the description of the system by an ensemble of surfaces is justified and used frequently @xcite .",
    "the monolayer is described by an ideal surface in this approach , with the shape and fluctuations determined by the curvature energy @xcite @xmath3\\ ] ] where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the mean and gaussian curvatures , respectively , and the integral runs over the total interface area .",
    "the parameters are the bending rigidity @xmath6 , the saddle - splay modulus @xmath1 , and the spontaneous curvature @xmath0 .",
    "most of the previous theoretical work on the phase behavior of ternary amphiphilic systems has focused on balanced systems with @xmath7 , and on the interplay between the curvature energy , which favors the lamellar phase , and entropy , which favors disordered bicontinuous or droplet phases @xcite . however , in addition to the curvature energy , long - range interactions between the molecules also give an important contribution to the free energy .",
    "this is well known for the unbinding of membranes @xcite , and for wetting transitions in simple fluids @xcite .",
    "attractive interactions have also been used to explain the reentrant phase separation of spherical and ( very long and flexible ) cylindrical micelles near the water apex of the composition phase diagram @xcite . in systems containing non - ionic amphiphiles , or in systems with screened electrostatic interactions ,",
    "the dominant contribution is the van der waals interaction @xcite .    in this paper , we want to study the dependence of phase diagrams on the spontaneous curvature @xmath0 .",
    "we consider systems with @xmath0 sufficiently large that the isotropic phase is a droplet microemulsion ( in order to avoid complications with the bicontinuous phase ) .",
    "it has been shown experimentally that @xmath0 varies linearly with temperature @xmath8 over a wide range of @xmath8 @xcite . using this relation for @xmath9",
    ", we can compare our results directly with the temperature dependence of experimental phase diagrams .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that in the zero - temperature limit , the curvature model  together with the constraints of fixed volume fractions @xmath10 of the amphiphile and @xmath11 of the interior phase  predicts for @xmath12 with increasing @xmath13 the progression from a lamellar phase via a phase of infinitely long cylindrical micelles to a phase of spherical micelles , while for @xmath14 the phase of cylindrical micelles is absent .",
    "this model has been extended to include both thermal fluctuations and long - range interactions in ref .",
    "however , with the interactions described phenomenologically , and no explicit temperature dependence , this model yields highly schematic phase diagrams , which can not be compared easily with experiment .",
    "we consider the coexistence of a lamellar phase @xmath15 and an oil - in - water microemulsion phase @xmath16 .",
    "we assume that @xmath1 is sufficiently negative that a hexagonal phase of cylindrical micelles is suppressed @xcite .",
    "the @xmath15-phase is a stack of oil- and water layers of thickness @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "all lengths are measured in units of the amphiphile length , so that the repeat distance in the lamellar phase is given by @xmath19 .",
    "the radius of the neutral surface of the oil droplets is denoted @xmath20 , so that the radius of the oil core is @xmath21 , while the outer radius of the micelle is @xmath22 ( for equal lengths of heads and tails ) . the number density of droplets is @xmath23 .",
    "we write the free - energy density , @xmath24 , of the lamellar and the droplet phases as a sum of three contributions , @xmath25 the curvature - energy density , @xmath26 , is given by @xmath27 thermal fluctuations in the lamellar phase lead to a steric ( repulsive ) interaction , as first proposed by helfrich @xcite . when the size of the amphiphile is used as an ultraviolet cutoff for the wavelengths of the undulation modes , the steric - interaction density of pairs of monolayers , which are separated by a water film of thickness @xmath18 ,",
    "is found to be @xmath28   +    \\frac{2}{\\xi_{\\parallel}^2 } \\arctan [ ( q_c \\xi_{\\parallel})^2 ] \\right ) \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the parallel correlation length .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 has been determined by monte carlo simulations to be @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ helfrichww_mod ] ) reduces to the familiar @xmath33-form of the steric interaction of _ two _ monolayers @xcite for @xmath34 .",
    "it has been pointed out recently that for an _ asymmetric _ lamellar phase , the steric interaction of two monolayers is a function of _ both _ the thickness of the oil and of the water films @xcite .",
    "this is obvious in the case of vanishing oil concentration , where the interacting surfaces are amphiphilic bilayers with an effective bending rigidity @xmath35 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , monte carlo simulations have been used to extract the expression @xmath36\\ ] ] with @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the steric interaction , @xmath39 , of two monolayers through an oil film is obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ helfrichww_mod ] ) and ( [ netz ] ) by interchanging @xmath18 and @xmath17 .",
    "thus , the total entropic part of the free - energy density of the lamellar phase is @xmath40 .    to calculate the entropy of the droplet phase , we assume that the swollen micelles behave as hard spheres of radius @xmath22 .",
    "the free - energy density is then very well approximated by the carnahan - starling form @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the packing fraction , and @xmath43 a microscopic length scale , which in the following is taken to be equal to the amphiphile length .",
    "undulation modes on microemulsion droplets give an additional contribution to the free energy , which in the limit @xmath44 has the form @xcite @xmath45 such a term becomes important for large droplet radii , and disfavors the droplet microemulsion in this regime .",
    "the entropic part of the free - energy density of droplets then reads @xmath46 .",
    "finally , we have to calculate the contribution of the van der waals interaction to the free energy .",
    "this is done within the hamaker approach , where a pairwise form of the interaction is assumed @xcite .",
    "the dielectric properties of the amphiphile tails ( heads ) are assumed to be identical to those of the oil ( water ) molecules .",
    "we subtract the free energy of the pure water phase , so that only the interaction between oil molecules ( and amphiphile tails ) has to be taken into account . for a molecular fluid",
    ", the interaction free - energy density is given by @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the interaction potential , which consists of a long - ranged attractive and a short - ranged repulsive part , and @xmath49 is the normalized density - density correlation function , which approaches unity for large distances and vanishes for short ones .",
    "we approximate the product of these two functions by @xmath50\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the hamaker constant .",
    "the parameter @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ interact ] ) determines at which length scale ( in units of the amphiphile length ) the repulsion becomes dominant .",
    "the calculation of the free - energy density , @xmath53 , of the van der waals interaction of the oil molecules within one aggregate is straightforward in both the droplet and lamellar phases ( compare ref .",
    "this also holds for the inter - aggregate part of the free - energy density , @xmath54 , in the lamellar phase . in the ( disordered ) droplet phase ,",
    "the inter - aggregate part is taken to be @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the interaction energy of two spheres of radius @xmath20 with distance @xmath57 between their centers . to obtain eq .",
    "( [ inter_drop ] ) , we have replaced the two - particle distribution function for hard spheres of radius @xmath22 by a step function @xcite . it is important to note that with the choice ( [ interact ] ) for the interaction potential , all interaction integrals can be carried out analytically .",
    "however , the results are rather lengthy and can therefore not be given here .",
    "in order to calculate phase diagrams , we add chemical potential terms to the free energy , and minimize with respect to @xmath18 and @xmath17 , or @xmath20 and @xmath23 , respectively . since the functional form of @xmath58 was determined self - consistently in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have to use the same procedure here .",
    "the free energies in our model depend on the parameters @xmath6 , @xmath1 , @xmath0 , and @xmath51 . the value of the hamaker constant is well known experimentally to be @xmath59 for the interaction of hydrocarbon across water @xcite . for @xmath60 one therefore has @xmath61 . for the spontaneous curvature , we assume a linear temperature dependence of the form @xmath62 , where @xmath63 denotes the phase - inversion temperature .    a typical sequence of phase diagrams with decreasing spontaneous curvature @xmath0 is shown in fig .  1 for bending rigidities of the order of @xmath64 .",
    "the parameters are chosen such as to allow a comparison with the experimentally well studied oil - water-@xmath65 system .",
    "in addition to the two - phase coexistence region of lamellar and droplet phase , we also show the two - phase coexistence of the droplet microemulsion with a pure oil - phase ( emulsification failure ) .",
    "we can follow the two - phase coexistence curves in the @xmath16-phase only to a minimum water concentration of about 30% , where the oil - filled micelles become close - packed .",
    "the most prominent feature of the phase diagrams shown in fig .",
    "1 is that with decreasing spontaneous curvature , the lamellar phase extends further and further into the water apex of the gibbs triangle .",
    "this behavior is in excellent agreement with experimental observations @xcite .",
    "phase diagrams for larger bending rigidities are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "for @xmath66 , the reentrant behavior of the droplet phase disappears , and the lamellar phase is found to be always stable for small oil content .",
    "finally , for @xmath67 , the lamellar phase ( with low oil content ) can no longer be swollen to large intermembrane separations , but coexists with an almost pure water phase .",
    "the extension of the lamellar phase into the water apex of the gibbs phase triangle for @xmath68 can be understood as follows .",
    "consider a path in the gibbs triangle of fig .",
    "1b of constant amphiphile concentration , for which the system is in the droplet phase for equal oil- and water concentrations . with decreasing oil content , the droplet size decreases , so that the bending energy cost for droplets increases , and ultimately leads to a transition into the lamellar phase .",
    "this is the effect considered in ref .  @xcite . with further decreasing oil content ,",
    "the steric interaction of the monolayers across the oil films increases , and leads to a ( reentrant ) transition to the droplet phase .",
    "when the bending rigidity is increased to @xmath66 , the lamellar phase can be swollen by a very large amount by adding water .",
    "thus , the repulsive interaction dominates in the lamellar phase for @xmath69 . only when the bending rigidity is increased to @xmath70",
    "does the attractive interaction begin to affect the phase behavior , and unbinding transitions @xcite can be observed ( compare refs .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of unbinding transitions in the binary water - amphiphile system ) .",
    "the first - order character of the phase transitions for @xmath69 discussed above should therefore hold beyond the superposition approach ( [ superposition ] ) .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the van der waals interaction is _ not _ strong enough to produce a two - phase coexistence between two droplet microemulsion , in agreement with recent calculations for colloidal systems @xcite .",
    "this result may change when the deformability of the oil droplets is taken into account , which allows a larger contact area of two adhering droplets and thereby increases the interaction energy @xcite .",
    "our work can be extended in several directions ; it would be interesting , for example , to investigate the stability of the hexagonal phase of cylindrical micelles .",
    "a more detailed comparison with experiment requires the systematic measurement of ternary phase diagrams with larger bending rigidities .",
