    "in the standard model , sm , transition rates of semileptonic processes such as @xmath1 , with @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) being a generic down ( up ) quark , can be computed with high accuracy in terms of the fermi coupling @xmath4 and the elements @xmath5 of the cabibbo - kobayashi maskawa ( ckm ) matrix .",
    "measurements of the transition rates provide therefore precise determinations of the fundamental sm couplings + a detailed analysis of semileptonic decays offers also the possibility to set stringent constraints on new physics scenarios . while within the sm all @xmath1 transitions are ruled by the same ckm coupling @xmath5 ( satisfying the unitarity condition @xmath6 ) and @xmath4 is the same coupling appearing in the muon decay , this is not necessarily true beyond the sm .",
    "setting bounds on the violations of ckm unitarity , violations of lepton universality , and deviations from the @xmath7 structure , allows us to put significant constraints on various new - physics scenarios ( or eventually find evidences of new physics ) . in the case of leptonic and semileptonic",
    "kaon decays these tests are particularly significant given the large amount of data recently collected by several experiments : bnl - e865 , kloe , ktev , istra+ , and na48 .",
    "the analysis of these data provides precise determination of fundamental sm couplings , sets stringent sm test almost free from hadronic uncertainties , and finally can discriminate between new physics scenarios .",
    "the high statistical precision of measurements and the detailed information on kinematical distributions have provided substantial progress on the theory side , in particular the theoretical error on hadronic form factors has been reduced at the 1% level . + the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first in sec",
    ".  [ brfits ] we present fits to world data on the leading branching ratios and lifetimes , for @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 mesons . sec .",
    "[ slopes ] summarizes the status of the knowledge of form factor slopes from @xmath11 decays .",
    "the physics results obtained are described in sec .",
    "[ resulta ] , in particular the measurement of @xmath12 .",
    "numerous measurements of the principal kaon brs , or of various ratios of these brs , have been published recently . for the purposes of evaluating @xmath12 ,",
    "these data can be used in a pdg - like fit to the brs and lifetime .",
    "a detailed description to the fit procedure and the references of all experimental input used can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . + for @xmath8 the results are given in table  [ tab : klbr ] , while table  [ tab : kpmbr ] gives the results for @xmath10 .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : vusf0 ] and given in table  [ tab : vusf0 ] , for @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and for the combination .",
    "the average , @xmath19 , has an uncertainty of about of @xmath20 .",
    "the results from the five modes are in good agreement , the fit probability is 58% . in particular , comparing the values of @xmath21 obtained from @xmath22 and @xmath23 we obtain a value of the su(2 ) breaking correction @xmath24 in agreement with the chpt calculation @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , recent analyzes on the so - called violations of dashen s theorem in the kaon electromagnetic mass splitting point to @xmath26 values of about @xmath27 .",
    "+ the test of lepton flavor universality ( lfu ) between @xmath28 and @xmath29 modes constraints a possible anomalous lepton - flavor dependence in the leading weak vector current .",
    "it can therefore be compared to similar tests in @xmath30 decays , but is different from the lfu tests in the helicity - suppressed modes @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the results on the parameter @xmath33 is @xmath34 , in excellent agreement with lepton universality . with a precision of @xmath35 the test in @xmath36 decays",
    "has now reached the sensitivity of other determinations : @xmath37 and @xmath38  @xcite + an independent determination of @xmath0 is obtained from @xmath39 decays .",
    "the most important mode is @xmath40 , which has been recently updated by kloe reaching a relative uncertainty of about @xmath41 .",
    "hadronic uncertainties are minimized considering the ratio @xmath42 : @xmath43 using the world average values of br(@xmath44 ) and of @xmath45 given in section  [ brfits ] and the value of @xmath46 from  @xcite we obtain : @xmath47",
    ".      the main obstacle in transforming these highly precise determinations of @xmath21 and @xmath50 into a determination of @xmath51 at the precision of 0.1@xmath52 , are the theoretical uncertainties on the hadronic parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 . by construction , @xmath48 is defined in the absence of isospin - breaking effects of both electromagnetic and quark - mass origin .",
    "more explicitly @xmath53 is defined by the @xmath54 matrix element of the vector current in the limit @xmath55 and @xmath56 , keeping kaon and pion masses to their physical values .",
    "this hadronic quantity can not be computed in perturbative qcd , but it is highly constrained by @xmath57 and chiral symmetry . in the chiral limit and , more generally , in the @xmath57 limit ( @xmath58 ) the conservation of the vector current implies @xmath48=1 .",
    "expanding around the chiral limit in powers of light quark masses we can write @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the nlo and nnlo corrections in chpt .",
    "the ademollo  gatto theorem implies that @xmath62 is at least of second order in the breaking of @xmath57 this in turn implies that @xmath60 is free from the uncertainties of the @xmath63 counter - terms in chpt , and it can be computed with high accuracy : @xmath64 . the difficulties in estimating @xmath48 begin with @xmath61 or at @xmath65 in the chiral expansion .",
    "several analytical approaches to determine @xmath61 have been attempted over the years , essentially confirming the original estimate by leutwyler and roos .",
    "the benefit of these new results , obtained using more sophisticated techniques , lies in the fact that a better control over the systematic uncertainties of the calculation has been obtained .",
    "however , the size of the error is still around or above @xmath66 , which is not comparable to the @xmath20 accuracy which has been reached for @xmath67 . + recent progress in lattice qcd gives us more optimism in the reduction of the error on @xmath48 below the @xmath66 level .",
    "most of the currently available lattice qcd results have been obtained with relatively heavy pions and the chiral extrapolation represents the dominant source of uncertainty .",
    "there is a general trend of lattice qcd results to be slightly lower than analytical approaches .",
    "an important step in the reduction of the error associated to the chiral extrapolation has been recently made by the ukqcd - rbc collaboration .",
    "their preliminary result @xmath68 is obtained from the unquenched study with @xmath69 flavors , with an action that has good chiral properties on the lattice even at finite lattice spacing ( domain - wall quarks ) .",
    "they also reached pions masses ( @xmath70 mev ) much lighter than that used in previous studies of @xmath48 .",
    "the overall error is estimated to be @xmath71 , which is very encouraging .",
    "+ in contrast to the semileptonic vector form factor , the pseudoscalar decay constants are not protected by the ademollo  gatto theorem and receive corrections linear in the quark masses .",
    "expanding @xmath49 in power of quark masses , in analogy to @xmath48 , @xmath72 one finds that the @xmath63 contribution @xmath73 is already affected by local contributions and can not be unambiguously predicted in chpt . as a result",
    ", in the determination of @xmath49 lattice qcd has essentially no competition from purely analytical approaches .",
    "the present overall accuracy is about @xmath66 .",
    "the novelty are the new lattice results with @xmath69 dynamical quarks and pions as light as @xmath74  mev , obtained by using the so - called staggered quarks .",
    "these analyzes cover a broad range of lattice spacings ( i.e.  @xmath75=0.06 and 0.15 fm ) and are performed on sufficiently large physical volumes ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that the sensitivity of @xmath49 to lighter pions is larger than in the computation of @xmath48 and that chiral extrapolations are far more demanding in this case . in the following analysis",
    "we will use as reference value the milc - hpqcd result @xmath77 .      to determine @xmath51 and @xmath78 we use the value @xmath79 , the result @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 . from the above",
    "we find : @xmath83 from @xmath11 only , and @xmath84 from @xmath85 only .",
    "these determinations can be used in a fit together with the the recent evaluation of @xmath86 from @xmath87 nuclear beta decays : @xmath78=0.97418@xmath880.00026 .",
    "this global fit gives @xmath89 and @xmath90 , with @xmath91 ( 42% ) .",
    "this result does not make use of ckm unitarity .",
    "if the unitarity constraint is included , the fit gives @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( 67% ) .",
    "both results are illustrated in figure [ fig : vusuni ] .",
    "the test of ckm unitarity can be also interpreted as a test of universality of the lepton and quark gauge couplings . using the results of the fit ( without imposing unitarity ) we obtain : @xmath96^{1/2 } = ( 1.1662 \\pm   0.0004)\\times 10^{-5}\\   { \\rm gev}^{-2}$ ] , in perfect agreement with the value obtained from the measurement of the muon lifetime : @xmath97 the current accuracy of the lepton - quark universality sets important constraints on model building beyond the sm .",
    "for example , the presence of a @xmath98 would affect the relation between @xmath99 and @xmath100 . in case of a @xmath98 from @xmath101",
    "grand unification theories we obtain @xmath102  gev at 95% cl , to be compared with the @xmath103  gev bound set through the direct collider searches  @xcite . in a similar way , the unitarity constraint also provides useful bounds in various supersymmetry - breaking scenarios .",
    "a particularly interesting test is the comparison of the @xmath51 value extracted from the helicity - suppressed @xmath85 decays with respect to the value extracted from the helicity - allowed @xmath11 modes . to reduce theoretical uncertainties from @xmath104 and electromagnetic corrections in @xmath85",
    ", we exploit the ratio @xmath105 and we study the quantity @xmath106 within the sm , @xmath107 , while deviation from 1 can be induced by non - vanishing scalar- or right - handed currents .",
    "notice that in @xmath108 the hadronic uncertainties enter through @xmath109 .",
    "in the case of effect of scalar currents due to a charged higgs , the unitarity relation between @xmath78 extracted from @xmath87 nuclear beta decays and @xmath51 extracted from @xmath110 remains valid as soon as form factors are experimentally determined .",
    "this constrain together with the experimental information of @xmath111 can be used in the global fit to improve the accuracy of the determination of @xmath108 , which in this scenario turns to be @xmath112 . here",
    "@xmath109 has been fixed from lattice .",
    "this ratio is the key quantity to be improved in order to reduce present uncertainty on @xmath108 .",
    "this measurement of @xmath108 can be used to set bounds on the charged higgs mass and @xmath113 .",
    "figure [ fig : higgskmunu ] shows the excluded region at 95% cl in the @xmath114@xmath113 plane .",
    "the measurement of br(@xmath115 ) can be also used to set a similar bound in the @xmath114@xmath113 plane .",
    "while @xmath116 can exclude quite an extensive region of this plane , there is an uncovered region in the exclusion corresponding to a destructive interference between the charged - higgs and the sm amplitude .",
    "this region is fully covered by the @xmath117 result .",
    "the vector and scalar form factors @xmath119 are analytic functions in the complex @xmath120plane , except for a cut along the positive real axis , starting at the first physical threshold @xmath121 , where they develop discontinuities .",
    "they are real for @xmath122 .",
    "cauchy s theorem implies that @xmath119 can be written as a dispersive integral along the physical cut where all possible on - shell intermediate states contribute to its imaginary part .",
    "a number of subtractions is needed to make the integral convergent .",
    "particularly appealing is an improved dispersion relation recently proposed where two subtractions are performed at @xmath123 ( where by definition , @xmath124 ) and at the so - called callan - treiman point @xmath125 .",
    "since the callan - treiman relation fixes the value of scalar form factor at @xmath126 to the ratio @xmath109 , the dispersive parametrization for the scalar form factor allows to transform the available measurements of the scalar form factor into a precise information on @xmath109 , completely independent of the lattice estimates .",
    "figure [ fig : cttest ] shows the values for @xmath48 determined from the scalar form factor slope measurements obtained using a dispersive parametrization and the callan - treiman relation , and @xmath77 . from result on the ff slope using the dispersive parameterization the value of @xmath68 from ukqcd / rbc is also shown .",
    "the na48 result is difficult to accommodate . here",
    "one can see that this result is also not consistent with the theoretical estimates of @xmath48 .",
    "in particular , it violates the fubini - furlan bound @xmath127 . for this reason",
    ", the na48 result will be excluded when using the callan - treiman constraint",
