    "generally speaking a soliton is a localized solution of an equation for the propagation of a field envelope .",
    "it stays localized under the opposite effects of linear dispersion tending to spread the wave and of nonlinearity making the wave steeper .",
    "we make one more step by considering this soliton as a ` true ' particle , that is by seeing it as a classical object that should be ultimately quantized to keep the consistency of our view of the physical world .",
    "this is of course not a new idea , see for instance the review @xcite on the quantization of various nonlinear equations for classical fields .",
    "quantum effects are irrelevant for macroscopic phenomena like solitary waves in a water channel .",
    "however , there is an instance of solitonic physics where quantization could bring significant new effects , namely the propagation of optical solitons in fibers : there the amplitude of the wave may be small enough to yield solitons with not too large action , measured in units of planck s constant @xmath0 .",
    "if the action is much larger than this quantum unit one is in the classical regime , many trajectories contribute to the saddle point of the feynman integral @xcite and quantum interferences between coherent quantum states become practically impossible .",
    "conversely , if the action is not too large compared to this quantum unit , one could observe quantum phenomena as tunneling and interferences .",
    "moreover , even if the quantum state has a coherence time shorter than the tunneling time , there is still quantum tunneling , but at a reduced rate because the build - up of the state on the other side of the barrier is slowed down @xcite .",
    "below we show that quantum tunneling of a soliton may occur between two weakly coupled fibers , and we discuss the possibility of quantum interference between the two states carried by each fiber .",
    "the starting point of our study is the well established result that _ classically _ a soliton injected in a given fiber can not switch to the other fiber , when the coupling is less than a certain critical value . in this range",
    "the soliton evolves towards the stable a - symmetric solution having its energy predominantly in the initial fiber @xcite .",
    "there exist another stable solution which is obtained by permutation of the two fibers . at small coupling",
    "the two a - symmetrical states are separated by a finite barrier that can not be crossed classically .",
    "we predict that this may be wrong in practice because of quantum tunneling .",
    "our derivation is based on the calculation of the tunneling probability which writes in the wkb approximation , as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the physical action associated to tunneling @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath3 may be small , even for a pulse with a large number of photons , because all dynamical phenomena we consider , like the balance between the nonlinearity , the group velocity dispersion and the coupling , imply small perturbations to the dominant effect resulting from the linear dispersionless terms of maxwell s equations .",
    "the perturbations we consider are as small as the nonlinear term @xmath4 with respect to the dominant term @xmath5 , in the expansion of the refractive index @xmath6 for the kerr medium of the fiber , @xmath7 being the optical intensity . in this sense",
    "a soliton is a bound state of photons : photons are attracted to each other by the focusing nonlinearity .",
    "the soliton resembles the atom of a heavy element which is a quantum object made of many electrons and nucleons .",
    "atomic physics has also to do with energies much smaller than the rest energy of the particles ( electrons and nucleons ) making the atom .",
    "another idea of atomic ( and quantum ! ) physics is relevant for our goal : if the atom remains in its ground state , it is able to make interferences with a wavenumber depending on its mass and velocity only , independently of the details of the state of its electrons and nucleons . in our study",
    "we assume the absorption and change of frequency of the photons by inelastic and/or raman scattering to be negligible , and discuss the role of these effects in interference experiments in the last section .",
    "let us outline the organization of this paper . in the section [ sec : classicalprop ]",
    "we introduce the classical model of propagation of solitons in fibers .",
    "first we deal with the single fiber , then with the two coupled fibers .",
    "there is nothing new here and we focus on what is relevant for us , namely the bifurcation diagram as a function of the coupling . for strong coupling",
    "the stable solution is symmetric ( with intensity equally shared between the two fibers ) . below a critical coupling",
    ", the classical prediction is that the stable soliton is a - symmetric , with a high amplitude in one fiber and a small amplitude in the other , as said above .",
    "the details of the transition are a bit complex because it is subcritical .",
    "this has been studied @xcite by direct numerical solution of the coupled pde s describing this problem ( equations ( [ eq : coupled1 ] ) and ( [ eq : coupled2 ] ) below ) .",
    "however interesting it is , this model presents some difficulties for our quantization problem .",
    "therefore , in the next section [ sec : classicalproptrial ] we outline another approach to the same problem , namely we use the lagrange formalism to compute approximate solutions with trial functions ( instead of the full unknown solution ) .",
    "thanks to an approriate choice of these functions , the pattern of bifurcations of the asymmetric to symmetric solitons , known from the direct numerical simulations , is well recovered .",
    "we use the same trial functions as malomed et al .",
    "@xcite who discuss very thoroughly the general issue in a paper that we recommend to the interested reader",
    ".    as explained in section [ sec : quantization ] , this ` trial dynamics ' is used then to quantize the system .",
    "this is of course not exact , but requires far less formalism than the full quantization of the two coupled nonlinear field equations .",
    "thanks to this method , one can use standard results and methods of quantum mechanics for systems with a few degrees of freedom ( as opposed to field theories ) .",
    "in particular , we can compute the trajectory under the potential barrier , found by multiplying the propagation variable z , and the hamilton - jacobi action @xmath2 by @xmath8 .",
    "this yields a well defined problem of hamiltonian mechanics , called sometimes the euclidean version of the initial problem .",
    "the tunneling factor is derived from the action of the heteroclinic trajectory joining the two equilibria : a stable equilibrium in the original hamiltonian system remains an equilibrium in the euclidean one , but it becomes unstable there .",
    "it turns out that the tunneling probability depends algebraically on the coupling between the two fibers .",
    "this is a significant remark for possible applications , because it yields a much smoother dependence with respect to the coupling than the usual exponentially small tunneling amplitudes .",
    "the last section summarizes the main results of this paper , discusses the possibility of interferences and presents some ideas for possible applications .",
    "quantitative predictions rest on the rather complex problem of turning back from the dimensionless equations used throughout this work to quantities with a physical dimension , something done in the appendix .",
    "the mathematical model for the dissipationless propagation of optical solitons in one fiber is the _ classical _ (= non quantum ) nonlinear schrdinger equation : @xmath9 even though this equation is called nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) , it does _ not _ mean at all that it makes a quantum system .",
    "it only resembles the usual schrdinger equation , but it describes a purely classical field , exactly as maxwell s equations do for an em field .",
    "this equation is written with real coefficients @xmath10 and @xmath11 carrying a physical dimension to make possible the discussion ( see appendix ) of the order of magnitude of the physical effects to be expected . the field @xmath12 is the complex amplitude of the electric field in the wave .",
    "we take it as a scalar , although polarization effects could be brought into the picture in principle .",
    "this equation is derived in the fresnel approximation , assuming that the changes of amplitude along the fiber are much slower and on much longer scales than the oscillations of the optical field itself and it is also written in the frame of reference moving with the speed of the envelop of the wave , where the position variable is @xmath13 . for @xmath10 and @xmath11 real ,",
    "this equation has a lagrange - like structure .",
    "it cancels the first order variation of the ` action ' @xmath14 \\mathrm{. } \\label{eq : nlslagr}\\ ] ] in this equation @xmath15 is the complex conjugate of @xmath12 .",
    "the writing of the action in equation ( [ eq : nlslagr ] ) brings in an important problem , because it is not ` the ' physical action .",
    "such a physical action has to have the dimension of the product of an energy and of a time .",
    "therefore , the action written in equation ( [ eq : nlslagr ] ) can not be an action from the point of view of physical dimensions .",
    "the physical action of the em field is proportional to @xmath16 , its derivation is postponed to the appendix .",
    "an overall constant multiplying factor does not change the euler - lagrange equations , but it is crucial when quantizing this system because this relies on a comparison between the action and @xmath17 , two quantities with the same physical dimension .    by rescaling @xmath18 ( assuming @xmath11 positive to be in the focusing case where solitons exist ) , and @xmath19 ,",
    "one obtains the dimensionless nonlinear shrdinger equation : @xmath20    this equation has a number of interesting symmetries .",
    "in addition to the galilean invariance ( if @xmath21 is a solution , then @xmath22 is also a solution ) , it has a dilation symmmetry : if @xmath21 is a solution and @xmath23 an arbitrary real number , then @xmath24 is also a solution .",
    "it has a two parameters family of soliton solutions : @xmath25 in this solution , @xmath26 is any real number and the phase @xmath27 is @xmath28 , with @xmath29 arbitrary constant phase .",
    "note that @xmath13 plays here the same role as the time in the usual schrdinger equation . among the conserved quantities associated to any solution of the nls equation ,",
    "let us write the `` energy ''    @xmath30 \\mathrm{. } \\label{eq : energie}\\ ] ]    suppose now that , instead of a single optical fiber , we have two identical coupled fibers , and that the coupling is linear and preserves the symmetry between the fibers . the propagation of solitons in this system has been studied in the last fifteen years @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .    to describe the two coupled fibers supporting solitons we introduce two focusing nls equations , written in a dimensionless form : @xmath31 and @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the strength of the linear coupling , and we define the `` mass '' @xmath34 which is a constant of motion .",
    "consider solutions of the form @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "because of the common phase factor @xmath37 the @xmath13-dependence cancels out and the two functions @xmath38 and @xmath39 are solutions of the two coupled ordinary differential equations :    @xmath40    for the solution to decrease to zero when @xmath41 tends to plus or minus infinity one must have @xmath42 .",
    "furthermore the sign of @xmath33 can be changed by changing @xmath43 into @xmath44 for instance and keeping @xmath45 the same .",
    "we choose @xmath33 positive that corresponds to in - phase stationary solutions ( @xmath46 ) , the out of phase ones being unstable @xcite .",
    "this set of equations has been studied numerically and analytically @xcite .",
    "an exact calculation shows that the symmetric solution @xmath47 always exists and is linearly stable in the range @xmath48 . for higher values of this ratio ,",
    "the symmetric solution looses its stability and an a - symmetric solution branches off .",
    "while it is not explicitely mentioned in @xcite , the subcritical character of the bifurcation can be deduced from fig.11 of the paper by akhmediev and soto - crespo(1994 ) when using @xmath49 as control parameter and @xmath50 as order parameter , i.e. by rotating the figure .",
    "consequently no stable and weakly asymmetric solutions branches off the unstable symmetric soliton for @xmath33 slighty smaller than the onset of linear stability , although an unstable asymmetric solution branches off at values of @xmath33 slightly larger than the critical one .",
    "furthermore a branch of stable asymmetric solitons goes continuously from @xmath51 to a finite coupling , slightly larger than the value of linear instability of the symmetric soliton .",
    "the stable asymmetric soliton disappears by a saddle - node bifurcation for a value of the coupling that is , by a numerical coincidence , very close to but smaller than the onset of linear stability of the symmetric soliton . at this saddle - node bifurcation",
    "the unstable and stable a - symmetric solutions merge to disappear at smaller values of @xmath49 .    in the numerical investigations of this problem",
    "an interesting phenomenon comes into play , namely the radiation of energy at large distances of the solitons .",
    "the amount of radiation is stronger when the initial conditions are further away from a stable solution @xcite .",
    "this radiation happens in the far wings of the time dependent amplitude profiles ( @xmath52 ) , where the full equation reduces to its linear part .",
    "although very strongly dispersive this describes radiation by wave packets of ever increasing width , but carrying nevertheless energy and eventually other invariants to infinity .",
    "such a coupling between a localized system and the infinitely many degrees of freedom of a radiating field may lead to irreversible effects @xcite .",
    "it shows how subtle may be the distinction between ` dissipative ' and ` nondissipative ' systems as soon as one goes beyond the obvious .",
    "irreversible process due to radiation may not even require an infinitely extended physical space .",
    "they may also take place in the reciprocal ( or momentum ) space by cascade of energy toward smaller and smaller scales , a typically nonlinear phenomenon @xcite .",
    "we plan to come back to the issue of the effect of radiation on quantum phenomena in the present problem .",
    "we shall neglect this kind of effect in the following , since they can not be taken into account within our simple formalism .",
    "even though the radiative losses are present , it was shown by fadeev and korepin @xcite that they do not destroy the solitons in a single fiber , when they are included in the quantized version of the nls equation .    in the coming section",
    "we shall derive a reduced set of equations describing the propagation of soliton in coupled fibers .",
    "indeed this reduction from the original pde s to a set of coupled ode s can not be quantitatively exact .",
    "however with the same choice of trial functions as malomed et al.@xcite we obtain at least a reduced system with the right pattern of bifurcation at decreasing coupling .",
    "the fundamental interest of this reduction is that it allows us to quantize the dynamical system rather straightforwardly .",
    "because of the lack of analytical solution in general , we follow an idea used already by various authors , that allows to understand in a fairly detailed way the results of the direct numerical simulation by using an analytical approach . this follows the general method of research of extrema of functionals by trial functions : dynamics can be reduced to a minimization problem , then one restricts the function space where this minimization is done to a space of trial functions depending explicitly on a few parameters and one studies the dynamical properties in this reduced space . since we know the results of the direct numerical simulations it is in principle possible to check the quality of the approximation by comparing its predictions and the ` exact ' results",
    "this is necessary because the method of trial functions does not rely on a small or large parameter and so can not hope to be ` exact ' or close to exact in the usual mathematical meaning of the word .",
    "the papers by malomed et al .",
    "@xcite discuss in depth the choice of the trial functions .",
    "we shall not reproduce this discussion here where we take their set of ` optimized ' trial functions , following as much as possible their notations .",
    "the starting point is the writing of the action for the coupled nls equations : @xmath53 \\mathrm{. } \\label{eq : nlslagrdimcoupl}\\ ] ]    as it can be checked the action @xmath54 is proportional to @xmath55 whenever the functions @xmath21 and @xmath56 are stationary solutions ( with respect to the variable @xmath13 ) of the two coupled nls equations ( [ eq : coupled1 ] ) and ( [ eq : coupled2 ] ) or functions proportional to the same phase factor @xmath37 .",
    "the problem we consider now is how does the coupling change the propagation of solitons . for that purpose",
    "we reduce the dependence with respect to @xmath41 to an imposed form ( the trial function ) with arbitrary @xmath13-dependent coefficients , the trial parameters . putting this trial form into the action integral and performing the integration over the variable @xmath41 yields a functional of the parameters of the trial function that are themselves functions of @xmath13 .",
    "doing now the variation with respect to those functions , one finds at the end a set of ode s for functions of @xmath13 only .",
    "the choice of the trial functions is inspired by the soliton solution in a single fiber and it respects the symmetry between the two fibers . following uzunov et al.@xcite one takes : @xmath57 \\cos(\\theta(z))exp\\left[i\\left(\\phi(z ) + \\psi(z ) + q(z ) t^{2}\\right)\\right ] \\mathrm { , } \\label{eq : trialu}\\ ] ] and @xmath58 \\sin(\\theta(z))exp\\left[i\\left(\\phi(z ) - \\psi(z ) + q(z ) t^{2}\\right)\\right ] \\mathrm{. } \\label{eq : trialv}\\ ] ] in the case of a single fiber carrying a soliton of amplitude @xmath59 , the trial function @xmath21 becomes the exact one - soliton solution with @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 constant .",
    "it is important to notice here that the angle @xmath64 is for describing the balance between the two fibers , although the angles @xmath65 and @xmath63 have a physical meaning independent on the trial function , being related to the phase of the functions @xmath59 and @xmath66 .",
    "the angle @xmath64 could be replaced by another parameter in another trial function , not necessarily a circular function .",
    "inserting this trial form into the action @xmath54 and performing the integration over @xmath41 , which is possible because the dependence with respect to @xmath41 is fully explicit in the trial functions , one finds a reduced action that is itself the integral over @xmath13 of the lagrange function : @xmath67 up to obvious change in notations ( from our @xmath13 to @xmath68 , from @xmath69 to @xmath70 , etc . )",
    "this lagrange function is identical to the one written by uzunov et al .",
    "@xcite but for a misprint in their paper where the term @xmath71 in the last parentheses became @xmath72 without harming the rest of their calculation .",
    "the parameters of the trial function are five functions of @xmath13 : @xmath73 , @xmath64 , @xmath63 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the equations of motion for those five functions are derived by variation of the action , namely the integral over @xmath13 of @xmath76 .",
    "they read : @xmath77 derived by variation with respect to @xmath65 , and    @xmath78 \\label{eq:4eqsmalomed } \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    derived by variation with respect to @xmath79 , and @xmath74 respectively     versus the stationary values of @xmath80 . for large coupling , i.e. @xmath81 , the symmetric solution , @xmath82 , is the only one stable . ]",
    "the parameter @xmath83 can be absorbed in the redefinition of @xmath33 and will be set to @xmath84 below ( that corresponds to a mass @xmath85 ) .",
    "the soliton solutions are @xmath13-independent solutions of this set of equations .",
    "there are two classes of soliton solutions in this model , depending on the coupling parameter . for any coupling there",
    "exists a symmetric soliton , with equal intensity in both fibers , i.e. @xmath86 . at small coupling this symmetric solution is unstable against asymmetric soliton .",
    "such an asymmetric soliton is found by canceling the @xmath13-derivatives in equations ( [ eq:4eqsmalomed ] ) and choosing @xmath87 .",
    "this yields the relation between the coupling coefficient @xmath33 and the balance parameter for the intensity @xmath88",
    "@xmath89    which is illustrated in fig.1 . using the trial functions ,",
    "the bifurcation in the set of possible solutions is found to occur at the critical value , @xmath90 which is 11 per cent less than the exact value @xcite , @xmath91 .",
    "moreover the bifurcation is slightly subcritical , in good agreement with the nls results @xcite .",
    "close to the bifurcation point there is a small range of values of the coupling , @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) where there are three sets of solutions : the symmetric solution that is linearly stable , and two pairs of asymmetric solutions , one linearly stable and another linearly unstable .",
    "the branch of stable asymmetric solution does not merge smoothly with the symmetric solution , but disappear when it has still a finite amplitude .",
    "the main conclusion that we shall draw here is that this set of trial functions reproduces well the pattern of bifurcation of the exact model .",
    "this makes it a good candidate for studying the quantum tunneling .",
    "before to start this study , let us explain how we managed to define a quantity related to the usual potential energy of a mechanical system .",
    "although this is not strictly necessary it helps to draw various quantities relevant for analyzing the tunneling by making a connection , however loose it is , with the familiar notions of barrier and of barrier crossing .",
    "the ` potential energy ' is derived from the total energy associated to the dynamical system under consideration , namely the equations ( [ eq : equationa ] ) to ( [ eq:4eqsmalomed ] ) .",
    "an expression for this energy is given by uzunov et al .",
    "with @xmath94 it becomes : @xmath95 note that the lagrangian ( [ eq : triallagr ] ) includes terms linear with respect to first derivatives ( with respect to @xmath13 ) .",
    "it means that the two successive operations of choosing trial functions and averaging over the retarded time @xmath41 , lead from the lagrangian formalism to the hamiltonian one , with @xmath96 the first term in the r.h.s .",
    "of equation ( [ eq : lag ] ) will be the one responsible for the euclidian action derived in the next section . as already noticed by uzunov et al .",
    ", equations ( [ eq : equationa ] ) to ( [ eq:4eqsmalomed ] ) are the hamilton equations of a two - degrees of freedom system .",
    "the two pairs of conjugate variables are @xmath97 , and @xmath98 , i.e. the phase and amplitude differences , as well as the chirp and width , respectively .",
    "we are interested in the value of @xmath99 for steady states , that turns out to be a simple function of the coupling @xmath33 .",
    "that should give an idea of how the energy changes when the variables are different of their values in the steady state(s ) . in order to preserve the connection with a potential energy in the usual sense we impose that , at the equilibrium points , this `",
    "potential ' energy is at an extremum .",
    "this is realized ( probably not uniquely ) by plugging into @xmath99 the values of @xmath75 and @xmath63 at the various equilibria , that is @xmath100 and @xmath101 to cancel the conjugate momenta .",
    "this yields : @xmath102    ( a ) ) , ( a ) for @xmath103 , only the symmetric solution @xmath82 is stable , ( b)for @xmath104 which belongs to the subcritical domain in fig.1 where symmetric and a - symmetric solutions are stable , ( c ) for @xmath105 , only two asymmetric solutions are stable , title=\"fig : \" ] ( b ) ) , ( a ) for @xmath103 , only the symmetric solution @xmath82 is stable , ( b)for @xmath104 which belongs to the subcritical domain in fig.1 where symmetric and a - symmetric solutions are stable , ( c ) for @xmath105 , only two asymmetric solutions are stable , title=\"fig : \" ] ( c ) ) , ( a ) for @xmath103 , only the symmetric solution @xmath82 is stable , ( b)for @xmath104 which belongs to the subcritical domain in fig.1 where symmetric and a - symmetric solutions are stable , ( c ) for @xmath105 , only two asymmetric solutions are stable , title=\"fig : \" ]    this ` potential ' energy depends on two parameters , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , and it is plotted in fig .",

    "@xmath109 , to a more complex pattern , as the coupling decreases . in particular ,",
    "some sort of barrier is evident in fig .",
    "it separates the two deep minima of the potential lying each in the vicinity of @xmath111 .",
    "each minimum corresponds to one of the stable asymmetric soliton , although the unstable symmetric soliton at @xmath112 is a saddle point of the potential energy .",
    "the above picture illustrates the known results : classically there is no way for a soliton initially in a given fiber , to escape through the other fiber , at low coupling , because of the barrier . before to present the quantum version of this problem ,",
    "let us precise what is the low coupling range in terms of physical quantities .",
    "note first that the low - coupling range writes @xmath113 for an incident soliton of the form @xmath114 injected in one of the two fibers ( @xmath115 above ) .",
    "secondly let us define the scaling quantities in equations([eq : coupled1])-([eq : coupled2 ] ) , by using the soliton units , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the dispersion length , and @xmath121 are the slowly varying amplitudes of the electric field ( see appendix ) .",
    "the relation ( [ eq : seuil ] ) becomes    @xmath122    or , @xmath123 when introducing the switching length @xmath124 defined for the cw linear regime . using the relation ( [ eq : beta ] )",
    ", the low coupling range also writes    @xmath125",
    "before computing the quantum tunneling , let us recall the main differences between the classical solitonic solution and its quantized form . in quantum mechanics a state localized on one side or on the other only is not an eigenstate of the system , because of the possibility of tunneling .",
    "therefore if one starts at ` time ' zero with all the amplitude on one side ( meaning all the probability in one of the two possible asymmetric states ) , after the time of tunneling this will be transferred to the other side and eventually oscillate between the two sides .",
    "it is also possible to inject at the input of the dual core fiber , the quantum ground state , which is symmetrical , with equal amplitude in the two sides . to have a physical image of the process by which the transition occurs between the two asymmetric states ,",
    "one may recall that the number of photons is not fixed in the quantized soliton , so that it fluctuates in both fibers .",
    "therefore , the fluctuations may bring one fiber into the soliton state , although the other goes to the state without soliton , and the two states switch in the course of time , as studied below .",
    "let us now outline how to compute the quantum tunneling between the two fibers . because we have a classical field",
    ", the quantization of the coupled equations ( [ eq : coupled1 ] ) , ( [ eq : coupled2 ] ) for the two fibers belongs to the general problem of quantization of field theories .",
    "although this may be done formally , it requires a rather heavy machinery in any case .",
    "fortunately there are various possible short cuts in this derivation .",
    "the most obvious one is to reduce pde s system to a set of ode s , by using trial functions depending on a certain set of unknown parameters . by refining the choice of trial functions ad infinitum , namely by introducing trial function with more and more parameters",
    ", one should converge in principle toward the exact result .",
    "but we will merely use the above described trial functions .",
    "the euler ",
    "lagrange condition of stationarity of the action yields a set of dynamical ( in ` time ' @xmath13 ) equation , that can be formally quantized because it has a symplectic structure .",
    "this is what we are going to do , except for one point .",
    "it is possible to short cut all this explicit quantization in the wkb limit , where the wave function is expressed by means of the classical hamilton - jacobi action , @xmath126 .",
    "this is the well - known quasi ",
    "classical limit , that restricts oneself to situations where any action involved is typically much bigger than @xmath17 .",
    "this seems a reasonable limit , but it does not necessarily cover all possible situations - we shall come at the end to what seems to be ` the ' standard experimental situation in this respect .",
    "the wkb limit is especially convenient for treating tunneling problems , because it amounts to calculate the imaginary part of the action ( which is complex ) and to put at the end @xmath17 at the right place .",
    "indeed the tunneling factor is is given by @xmath127 , at leading order .",
    "here @xmath128 is the imaginary part of the action , which enters then in the modulus of the wave function as a real exponent ( instead of the usual imaginary exponent relevant for the classical limit of quantum mechanics ) .",
    "this imaginary part of the action is calculated by two steps",
    ". first one has to change the conjugate variables @xmath129 into @xmath130 in the classical hamilton - jacobi formulation of quantum mechanics , the hamiltonian @xmath131 becoming @xmath132 .",
    "secondly one is left with a problem of extremalization of a new action , the euclidean action , that is formally another problem of classical mechanics .",
    "for instance in the often presented problem of a particle of energy @xmath133 in a double well potential @xmath134 , with hamiltonian @xmath135 , the euclidean action is calculated with the abbreviated action @xcite    @xmath136}^{q[z_{f}]}pdq \\label{eq : action - red}\\ ] ]    .    derived from the hamiltonian @xmath137 but with the same energy as the one of the classical motion . for the potential this means that it gets rotated by 180 degrees , thus exhibiting two `` hills '' of maximal energy .",

    ", it could even happen that the wkb quasiclassical approximation is not valid anymore for computing the rate of transfer from one fiber to the other .",
    "usually the order of magnitude of the action involved in the soliton picture , even in a single fiber , is tacitly assumed to be far bigger than @xmath17 , which is an assumption distinct from the one of a soliton made of many photons .",
    "indeed the soliton picture addresses perturbations to this ` bound state ' of many photons that may be small enough to imply variations of the action of order of @xmath17 , and so require some sort of ( ` second ' ) quantization .",
    "we plan to come to this general question in future work , and outline here some of the estimated problems .",
    "a treatment using the trial function , but valid beyond the wkb approximation , is obviously more complicated than what we did here , and perhaps questionable .",
    "indeed it needs to consider both the trial functions and their parameters as operators .",
    "moreover it amounts to assume that the fluctuations in @xmath41 and @xmath13 are decoupled , and , last but not least , our result derived in the wkb approximation likely signals that the assumption behind the classical ( meaning non quantum ) theory for describing soliton in coupled fibers does not hold anymore and that the quantum picture has to be used from the start , which makes it theoretically challenging .",
    "we assumed that every phenomenon under study involved solitons seen as a coherent quantum objects .",
    "we argued that this requires that any typical time , the tunneling time in particular , is far shorter than the coherence time .",
    "this coherence time is of order of @xmath283 , with @xmath284 coherence time of a single photon in the soliton , i.e. its mean - free flight time without change in phase or frequency .",
    "because of the division by @xmath285 this may be a very short time . at times longer than the coherence time",
    "any physical effect related to the quantum coherence between states of solitons propagating in either fiber is washed out .",
    "the final state , as described in the density matrix formalism , is a state of equal probability of the soliton on either side without nondiagonal element .",
    "the experimental manifestation of this state will be a probability @xmath286 of observing a soliton in either fiber without any possible interference between the states on either side .",
    "somehow this will bring the system back to a fully classical state , except that this classical state has a probabilistic underpinning that is absent from the classical system : in the fully classical system the soliton remains always in the same fiber , although in the quantum one its final state has a probabilistic nature .",
    "looking at the other side of the coin one realizes that , because the soliton is a composite object , and if it remains coherent during a sufficiently long amount of time , its phase is the phase of a single photon multiplied by the number of photons .",
    "therefore any interference experiment between coherent soliton states will have much narrower interfringe than with a single photon or incoherent photons , this interfringe being the one for a single photon divided by the number of photons making the coherent soliton .",
    "this could be of interest for gyroscopes based on the sagnac effect @xcite .",
    "indeed a central issue concerning the observability of the tunneling effect we present in this communication is the one of the quantum coherence of the soliton , related itself to all dissipative effects that can break up this coherence , and that makes the main topic discussed in the present special issue .",
    "nevertheless , even if the coherence is limited , there is still tunneling , but at a reduced rate @xcite . in that case",
    "we suggest to use twin fibers with coupling coefficient @xmath33 periodically modulated in @xmath13 , in order to stimulate the switching process .",

    "this appendix is about the relationship between quantities measured in physical units for a standard fiber carrying solitons and the dimensionless quantities used in the bulk of our paper .",
    "we relate first the number of photons in a typical soliton to its time duration , a duration called @xmath249 that we shall use afterwards to give various order of magnitudes pertinent to our problem .",
    "we use the standard expression of the electric field in a fiber , written with the same notations as in the book by newell and moloney @xcite .",
    "the electric field of the em wave in the fiber is modelized by the wave - packet expression , @xmath287 which obeys in a first approximation maxwell s equations , when the duration of the pulse is not too short , @xmath288 being the transverse coordinate , and @xmath289 the dimensionless radial amplitude with @xmath290 as the core area .    taking @xmath291 as a small parameter , @xmath292 being the frequency width of the pulse ,",
    "one obtains the nls equation written in variables @xmath293 , the nonlinear and the dispersion term having opposite signs : @xmath294 note that we turned to the standard writing of the coefficients of the nls equation , @xmath204 being the modulus of the coefficient of the cubic kerr effect and @xmath295 the modulus of the second derivative of the wavenumber @xmath296 with respect to the the frequency of the em wave .            where @xmath301 is the optical intensity measured in watt per square meter , and @xmath302 is the poynting vector integrated across the fiber section , with a result expressed in watts : @xmath303 where @xmath304 is the unit vector in the direction of propagation .    the magnetic field in the wave ( supposing it is linearly polarized with the electric field in the @xmath227-direction ) is @xmath305 , n index of refraction . for a material with instantaneous response , after averaging over one period of the field oscillations , one finds                                      let us note that the nonlinear index of refraction @xmath204 may be several orders of magnitude larger , when using other materials .",
    "for example , in the experiment of wa et al .",
    "@xcite , the optical switch was studied in multiple quantum well wave - guides , with @xmath325 .",
    "+        the dominant contributions are proportional to the linear part of the refractive index , namely a term contained in the maxwell equation .",
    "the subdominant contributions @xmath328 and @xmath329 , correspond to the terms contained in the envelope equation , they are perturbations to the dominant effects calculated above . for two coupled fibers ,",
    "these perturbations result from balanced effects of dispersion , coupling and nonlinearity .",

    "this correction is the `` coherent '' part of the energy in the sense that it is proportional to the square of the intensity , or of the photon number .",
    "finally we are ready to express the physical value of the hamiltonian and action associated to a soliton whose temporal width is scaled to @xmath249 as it was assumed in sections 3 - 4 , by using the expression ( [ eq : w1 ] ) with            the quantum tunneling coefficient @xmath342 is expected to be experimentally observable when the physical action is not too large with respect to @xmath17 .",
    "when @xmath343 becomes of order @xmath17 , we can infer that we are in the `` pure quantum '' regime .",

    "<S> we investigate one possible realization of such a quantum tunneling with solitons as basic entities . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we consider a soliton propagating in two linearly coupled fibers that are assumed identical . </S>",
    "<S> it has been known for some time that , at small enough coupling , asymmetric solitons only can propagate and be stable . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of such asymmetric solitons is predominantly in either fiber and remains there forever classically . </S>",
    "<S> this makes , for a given energy , two possible steady states exactly symmetrical with respect to each other under permutation of the two fibers . in the quantum version of the same problem , </S>",
    "<S> the two solitons merge into a single quantum state sharing a quantum amplitude spread between the two fibers , because of the possibility of _ quantum _ tunneling from one fiber to the other . </S>",
    "<S> we study this problem thanks to a reduced set of equations derived from the full set of coupled nonlinear pde s by choosing convenient trial functions for the classical soliton dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to this choice , the bifurcation pattern of the soliton solution in the coupled fibers is well reproduced . because the trial set generates dynamical equations with a lagrange structure , this lagrangian system is relatively easy to quantize . to obtain the quantum amplitude of transmission by tunneling under the barrier , </S>",
    "<S> one replaces the original hamiltonian system by its euclidean counterpart . </S>",
    "<S> orders of magnitude relevant for a possible physical application are given . * </S>"
