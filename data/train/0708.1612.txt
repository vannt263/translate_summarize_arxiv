    "<S> we perform a global fits to charmless @xmath0 decays which independently constrain the @xmath1 vertex of the unitarity triangle . </S>",
    "<S> the fitted amplitudes and phase are used to predict the branching ratios and cp asymmetries of all decay modes , including those of the @xmath2 system . </S>",
    "<S> different schemes of su(3 ) breaking in decay amplitude sizes are analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of having a new physics contribution to @xmath3 decays is also discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> although charmless modes are rare processes , they are very sensitive to the smallest ckm matrix elements through decay amplitudes and mixing . with more modes being observed and measured at higher precisions , it becomes possible to use purely rare decays to provide a independent determination of the unitarity triangle vertex @xmath1 , expressed in terms of the wolfenstein parameters , without reference to the charmonium modes . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore interesting to see whether the charmless @xmath4 decay data alone also provide a ckm picture consistent with other constraints and to search for indication of new physics . </S>",
    "<S> there has been several global fits using flavor isospin , su(3 ) invariant matrix elements @xcite or flavor flow topological diagram@xcite . in this talk , we present an updated global @xmath5 fits to the available charmless @xmath6 decays using the flavor diagram approach @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fitting parameters include the wolfenstein parameters @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , magnitudes of different flavor amplitudes , and their associated strong phases . </S>",
    "<S> to take into account su(3 ) breaking , we also include breaking factors of amplitude sizes as our fitting parameters in some fits . in the present approximation , </S>",
    "<S> we consider five dominant types of independent amplitudes : a `` tree '' contribution @xmath10 ; a `` color - suppressed '' contribution @xmath11 ; a `` qcd penguin '' contribution @xmath12 ; a `` flavor - singlet '' contribution @xmath13 , and an `` electroweak ( ew ) penguin '' contribution @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the former four types are considered as the leading - order amplitudes , while the last one is higher order in weak interactions . </S>",
    "<S> there are also other types of amplitudes , such as the `` color - suppressed ew penguin '' diagram @xmath15 , `` exchange '' diagram @xmath16 , `` annihilation '' diagram @xmath7 , and `` penguin annihilation '' diagram @xmath17 . due to dynamical suppressions , </S>",
    "<S> these amplitudes are ignored in the analysis . </S>",
    "<S> this agrees with the recent observation of the @xmath18 decay .    to see the effects of su(3 ) symmetry breaking , we consider the following four fitting schemes in our analysis : 1 ) exact flavor su(3 ) symmetry for all amplitudes ; 2 ) including the factor @xmath19 for @xmath20 only ; 3 ) including the factor @xmath19 for both @xmath20 and @xmath21 ; and 4 ) including a universal su(3 ) breaking factor @xmath22 for all amplitudes on top of scheme  3 . to reduce the number of parameters , we assume exact flavor su(3 ) symmetry for the strong phases in these fits . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the observables in @xmath0 modes , we also include @xmath23 and @xmath24 as our fitting observables .    in the first step , </S>",
    "<S> we include only @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 modes . </S>",
    "<S> the four scheme gives @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the naive factorization motivated scheme 3 has the best goodness - of - fit . </S>",
    "<S> the best - fitted values of the parameters in their 1 @xmath30 ranges ( amplitudes in units of @xmath31ev ) are @xmath32    the results show a nontrivial strong phase @xmath33 as well as a large @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the fitted @xmath14 agrees with the sm expectation . </S>",
    "<S> however , the low @xmath35 observed by the experiment is not reproduced , which is the main source of the inconsistency of the fit . in this scheme the following results for the weak phases @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 are obtained @xmath39 the allowed range for @xmath40 is given in fig.1a , which shows an overall agreement with the other global fits@xcite . however </S>",
    "<S> , our results favor a slightly larger @xmath38 and the area of the ut .    </S>",
    "<S> we further carry out the analysis with the inclusion of modes with @xmath41 and @xmath42 in the final state . </S>",
    "<S> in all the schemes a large @xmath13 is found , in particular @xmath43 for scheme 3 , which is driven by large @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> other hadronic amplitudes remain almost unaffected . </S>",
    "<S> note that the fit results favor an even larger @xmath38 , which can be clearly seen from fig.1b and the following best fitted phase angles @xmath45 using the fitted parameter , we make predictions for all @xmath2 modes . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , we predict @xmath46 which on the lower side but still consistent with the latest cdf data @xmath47 . due to the large @xmath13 obtained from the fits </S>",

    "<S> it then is of interest to examine if other modes involving @xmath53 mesons follow the similar pattern . </S>",
    "<S> our result shows , however , that in this case the best fitted @xmath70 is compatible with zero . </S>",
    "<S> possible reasons for that are @xmath71 is closer to the sm value , and there is no @xmath26 cp puzzle in the @xmath72 modes . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> the best fitted ckm parameters @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath7 remain almost unchanged .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> our fits render an area of the @xmath1 vertex slightly deviated from but still consistent with that obtained from other constraints . </S>",
    "<S> we predict the branching ratios and cp asymmetries of all decays using flavor su(3 ) symmetry , including the @xmath2 system . </S>",
    "<S> the latter will be compared with data already or to be measured at the tevatron , large hadron collider ( lhc ) , and kekb upgraded for running at @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of having a new physics contribution to @xmath3 decays is examined from the data fitting point of view . </S>",
    "<S> although there is some hint of new physics in @xmath26 system in electroweak penguin sector , it remains to be confirmed from other @xmath6 modes . </S>",
    "<S> it would be interesting to see if the current puzzles in @xmath26 is correlated to other modes from the future precision experiments . </S>"
