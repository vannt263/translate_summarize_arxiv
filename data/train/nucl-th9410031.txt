    "one of the most interesting future directions in nuclear physics may be to study how nuclear matter properties change as the environment changes .",
    "forthcoming ultra - relativistic heavy - ion experiments are expected to give significant information on the strong interaction ( i.e. , qcd ) in matter , through the detection of changes in hadronic properties  @xcite . in particular , the variations in hadron masses in the nuclear medium have attracted wide interest because such changes could be a signal of the formation of hot hadronic and/or quark - gluon matter in the energetic nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "several authors have recently studied the vector - meson ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) masses using the vector dominance model  @xcite , qcd sum rules  @xcite and the walecka model ( qhd )  @xcite , and have reported that the mass decreases in the nuclear medium .",
    "there is also a proposal to look for such mass shifts at cebaf  @xcite .    in the approach based on qcd sum rules ,",
    "the reduction of the mass is mainly due to the four - quark condensates and one of the twist-2 condensates , @xmath3 .",
    "however , it has been suggested that there may be considerable , intrinsic uncertainty in the standard assumptions underlying the qcd sum - rule analyses  @xcite . on the other hand , in hadronic models like qhd  @xcite ,",
    "the main reason for the reduction in masses is the polarization of the dirac sea  @xcite , where the _ antinucleons _ in matter play a crucial role .",
    "however , from the point of view of the quark model , the strong excitation of _ nucleon - antinucleon pairs _ in medium is difficult to understand .",
    "it is clear that these two mechanisms are quite different .",
    "several years ago guichon  @xcite proposed an entirely different model for nuclear matter , based on a mean - field description in which quarks ( in nucleon bags ) interact self - consistently with @xmath4 and @xmath0 mesons .",
    "the model has been refined by fleck _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and the present authors .",
    "it provides a natural explanation of nuclear saturation and the right magnitude of the nuclear compressibility .",
    "we have used this model to investigate the nuclear structure functions  @xcite , the properties of both nuclear and neutron matter  @xcite and the okamoto - nolen - schiffer anomaly and isospin symmetry breaking in matter  @xcite .",
    "we argued that the response of the internal structure of the nucleon to its environment is vital to the understanding of , not only physics with momentum transfers of several gev ( eg .",
    ", deep - inelastic scattering ) , but also physics at scale of a few mev ( eg . , a violation of charge symmetry in nuclear medium ) . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the relationship between the guichon model ( alias the quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model in our papers ) and qhd has also been clarified . even though this model is extremely simple",
    ", the insights gained from it may help to reveal the essential physics  @xcite .",
    "here we use the guichon model to investigate variations of various hadronic properties , as well as the density dependence of the quark condensate in nuclear matter , as functions of the nuclear density up to four times normal nuclear density .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the qmc model is introduced and applied to calculate the modification of the properties of the nucleon in nuclear matter .",
    "the masses of the vector mesons ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) and the hyperons ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) in matter are studied in sec .",
    "we find that the change in the hadron masses can be described in terms of scalar mean - field values in medium .",
    "some relationships among the hadron masses are given .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "iv , we use this model to study the density dependence of the quark condensate , which may be linked to a diverse range of nuclear phenomena . the density dependence of the quark condensate can be well fitted by a linear function of the nuclear density . then , some connections among the hadron properties and the quark condensate in medium are discussed .",
    "v contains our conclusions .",
    "the qmc model treats nuclear matter as a collection of ( nucleon ) mit bags , self - consistently bound by the exchange of scalar ( @xmath4 ) and vector ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) mesons .",
    "we assume that nuclear matter with @xmath8 is uniformly distributed , and that the mesons can be treated in mean - field approximation ( mfa ) .",
    "let the mean - field values for the @xmath4 , @xmath0 ( the time component ) and @xmath1 ( the time component in the third direction of isospin ) fields be @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the quarks in a static spherical bag interact with those mean fields .",
    "the dirac equation for a quark field , @xmath12 , in a bag is then given by @xmath13 \\psi_q = 0 , \\label{eq : dirac}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , with the quark - meson coupling constants , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 . the bare quark mass is denoted by @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the third pauli matrix .",
    "the normalized , ground state for a quark is then given by @xmath22 { j_{0}(x_q r / r ) \\choose i\\beta_q { \\vec{\\sigma}}\\cdot\\hat{r}j_{1}(x_q r / r ) } { \\frac{\\chi_q}{\\sqrt{4\\pi } } } , \\label{eq : psiq}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 @xmath24/x_q^2 , \\label{eq : norm}\\ ] ] @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 the quark spinor .",
    "the effective quark mass , @xmath28 , is defined by @xmath29 for both _ u _ and _ d _ quarks . the linear boundary condition , @xmath30 , at the bag surface determines the eigenvalue , @xmath31 .    using the su(6 )",
    "spin - flavor wave function for the nucleon , the nucleon energy is given by @xmath32 for @xmath33 , where the bag energy is @xmath34 with @xmath35 the bag constant and @xmath36 a phenomenological parameter accounting for a multitude of corrections , including zero - point motion . here",
    "@xmath37 is the number of quarks in the nucleon . to correct for spurious c.m .",
    "motion in the bag  @xcite the mass of the nucleon at rest is taken to be @xmath38 the effective nucleon mass , @xmath39 , in nuclear matter is given by minimizing eq.([eq : cmc ] ) with respect to @xmath40 .    .@xmath41 and @xmath36 for some bag radii ( @xmath42 5 mev ) . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the values of the coupling constants are listed in table  [ coupc ] . in the last two columns ,",
    "the relative changes ( with respect to the values at zero density ) of the bag radius and the lowest eigenvalue are shown .",
    "the present model gives a good value for the nuclear compressibility ",
    "around 200 mev .",
    "if we take a heavier current - quark mass , the effective nucleon mass and the nuclear compressibility are , respectively , reduced and enhanced .",
    "the strength of the scalar mean - field , @xmath43 , in medium is shown in fig.[vsig ] . at small density",
    "it is well approximated by a linear function of the density ( see also eq.(40 ) in ref.@xcite ) : @xmath44    the dependence of the effective nucleon mass on the nuclear density is shown in fig.[efnms ] .",
    "it decreases as the density goes up , and it behaves like constant at large density .",
    "we find that the effective nucleon mass at small density is approximately given by @xmath45 which is identical to the model independent result derived using qcd sum - rules  @xcite .    in fig.[gastr ] the density dependence of",
    "the axial - vector coupling constant of the nucleon is illustrated .",
    "it decreases as the density increases .",
    "on the other hand , the magnetic moment of the proton in symmetric nuclear matter increases with density as shown in fig.[magmom ] .",
    "the calculation of these quantities is standard  @xcite ( c.m . and recoil corrections are not included  @xcite ) .",
    "it is rather easy to understand why @xmath46 and @xmath47 tend to decrease and increase , respectively , with density : in the bag model these quantities involve integrals over the upper and lower components of the quark wave function . because the attractive scalar potential effectively decreases the quark mass it makes the solution more relativistic ",
    "i.e. , the lower component of the wave function is enhanced .",
    "this fact leads , respectively , to the decrease and increase of @xmath46 and @xmath47 in medium .",
    "given the simplicity of this argument we find the conclusion that the magnetic moments of the other hadrons should increase quite compelling .    at small density , we can expand @xmath46 and @xmath47 in terms of @xmath48 .",
    "if we take the quark to be massless for simplicity , and ignore the dependence of @xmath46 and @xmath47 on the change of the bag radius in medium , they are expressed as @xmath49 and @xmath50 where @xmath51 = 2.04 , @xmath40 = 0.8 @xmath52 and eq.([eq : appv ] ) is used .",
    "these formulae can roughly reproduce both the ratios at small density .",
    "furthermore , we have calculated the charge radius of the proton in medium , and we find that the change is within a few per cent even at @xmath53 .    here",
    "we must add a caution that the contribution of meson exchange currents ( mec ) to @xmath46 , @xmath47 , etc . would be considerable in medium , and , hence",
    ", we should treat the whole problem including mec to get the final results for the changes in these quantites .",
    "this is obviously beyond the scope of the present work .    finally , we record that the variations of the above nucleon properties depend only very weakly on the proton fraction , @xmath54 , which is defined as @xmath55 , because the @xmath1 meson does not play a role in determining the nucleon structure in medium ( see eqs.([eq : qem ] )  @xmath56  ( [ eq : cmc ] ) ) .",
    "further investigations concerning the nucleon properties , the equation of state for matter , etc . can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "now we are in a position to present our main results .    in fig.[vecms ]",
    ", the ratio of the effective vector - meson mass , @xmath57 , to that in free space is shown as a function of the density .",
    "since the difference between the effective @xmath0- and @xmath1-meson masses at the same density is very small , we show only one curve for both mesons in the figure . as the density increases the vector - meson mass decreases ( as several authors have previously noticed  @xcite ) , and seems to become flat like the effective nucleon mass .",
    "the mass reduction can be well expressed by a linear form at small density : @xmath58 the reduction factor , 0.09 , is somewhat smaller than that predicted by the qcd sum rules  @xcite . in this model",
    "the reduction in the mass is basically caused by the attractive scalar mean - field in medium , and this origin is clearly different from that in qhd  @xcite , in which the essential mechanism is the vacuum polarization due to the excitation of _ nucleon - antinucleon pairs _ in medium .",
    "it is possible to calculate masses of other hadrons in this model . in particular",
    ", there is considerable interest in studying the properties of hyperons in medium  eg .",
    "@xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 . for the hyperons themselves",
    "we again use the mit bag model , including the c.m .",
    "corrections ( see eq.([eq : cmc ] ) ) .",
    "we assume that the strange quark does not couple to the @xmath4 meson in mfa , and that the addition of a single hyperon to nuclear matter of density @xmath48 does not alter the values of the scalar and vector mean - fields .",
    "the mass of the strange quark , @xmath59 , is determined so as to reproduce the mass splitting between the nucleon and the average of @xmath5 and @xmath6 hyperons , @xmath60 mev ) , in free space .",
    "we then find @xmath59 = 355.5 , 358.1 , 354.0 mev for @xmath61 = 0.6 , 0.8 , 1.0 @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "using these values of the strange - quark mass , we have calculated the average mass of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath62 , and the mass of @xmath7 , @xmath63 , in symmetric nuclear matter .    in fig.[lamsig ] , the average mass , @xmath62 , in medium is illustrated .",
    "the density dependence of @xmath62 is very similar to the cases of the vector meson and the nucleon .",
    "the ratio is again well described by a linear function at small density : @xmath64 note that the reduction factor in the mass formula is almost the same value as in eq.([eq : vmms ] ) .",
    "the effective @xmath7-hyperon mass in medium is shown in fig.[xi ] .",
    "the ratio again behaves like the case of @xmath62 , but an approximate form for @xmath65 at low density is given by @xmath66 where the reduction factor is about half of those in eqs.([eq : vmms ] ) and ( [ eq : avms ] ) .",
    "we summarize the effective masses of the hadrons in medium in fig.[all ] .",
    "as one can see from the figure , the reduction in both the vector - meson mass and the average mass of @xmath5 and @xmath6 are about twice that in the @xmath7-hyperon mass over a wide range of @xmath48 , while the reduction in the nucleon is about three times that in the @xmath7 .",
    "one can also see this fact from the reduction factors in eq.([eq : nms ] ) and eqs.([eq : vmms ] )  @xmath56  ( [ eq : xims ] ) .",
    "it is rather easy to understand why such a relationship holds among the hadron masses : the nucleon consists of three non - strange quarks , which couple to the scalar mean - field in medium , while the vector mesons , and the @xmath5 and @xmath6 hyperons , involve just two non - strange quarks .",
    "the @xmath7 hyperon consists of only one non - strange quark and two strange quarks .",
    "since the strange quark does not feel the scalar mean - field , its mass is not altered in medium .",
    "the change in the hadron mass is therefore roughly determined by the number of non - strange quarks , @xmath67 , and the strength of the scalar mean - field , @xmath43 .",
    "we can then find an approximate form of the hadron mass in symmetric nuclear matter : @xmath68 where const @xmath69 .",
    "note that this formula is not too sensitive to the bag radius , and that it can reproduce the hadron masses reasonably well over the range of @xmath48 up to about @xmath70 .",
    "from eq.([eq : appms ] ) we expect the following relations among the hadron masses : @xmath71 furthermore , using eqs.([eq : axst ] ) and ( [ eq : magst ] ) , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath57 at small density could be linked as @xmath72 finally , we record that the proton - fraction dependence of the effective masses we have studied in this section is again very weak .",
    "having shown that the qmc model provides an interesting description of the hadron mass in nuclear matter we now apply it to study the behavior of the quark condensates in medium .",
    "the quark condensates are very important parameters in the qcd sum rules , and it is believed that they are linked to a wide range of nuclear phenomena , including the effective hadron mass in medium  @xcite .    the difference of the quark condensate in matter , @xmath73 , and that in vacuum , @xmath74 , is given through the hellmann - feynman theorem  @xcite : @xmath75 where @xmath76 .",
    "using the scc , one finds @xmath77 @xmath78 and @xmath79 where @xmath80 or @xmath1 , and @xmath81 is the quark - scalar density in the vector meson given by eq.([eq : sd ] ) ( using the variables for the vector meson instead of those for the nculeon ) .",
    "then , using the parametrization for the derivative of the @xmath4-meson mass with respect to the quark mass  @xcite , @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the nucleon @xmath4 term  @xcite , and the gell - mann  oakes  renner relation , the ratio of the quark condensate in medium to that in vacuum is written by a rather lengthy formula : @xmath84 , \\label{eq : cond1}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 is the pion mass ( 138 mev ) , @xmath86 the pion decay constant ( 93 mev ) and the coefficients , @xmath87 , are given by @xmath88 @xmath89 and @xmath90 we use @xmath91 = 45 mev  @xcite .",
    "the derivatives of the scalar mean - field and the coupling constants with respect to the quark mass are calculated numerically  eg . , the coupling constants are approximately given by quadratic or linear functions of the quark mass : for @xmath61 = 0.8 @xmath52 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",
    "in fig.[cond ] we show the ratio of the quark condensate in medium to that in vacuum .",
    "as one can see , the density dependence of the quark condensate can be well fitted by a linear function of the density : @xmath95 where the reduction factors , @xmath96 , are for the proton fractions , @xmath97 , respectively .",
    "the value of 0.36 agrees with the model - independent prediction of cohen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "note that the ratio is not sensitive to the bag radius .",
    "if we take a heavier current quark mass ( eg .",
    ", @xmath98 = 10 mev ) , the reduction in the ratio becomes smaller ( about 1 % at @xmath99 ) than the present case .",
    "taking up the terms of @xmath100 in eq.([eq : cond ] ) to see the behavior at low density , the ratio is given by @xmath101 using eq.([eq : appv ] ) , @xmath102 260 and @xmath103 0.37 , eq.([eq : cond2 ] ) can reproduce eq.([eq : condapp ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , since the ratio of the hadron mass in medium to that in free space is roughly described by eq.([eq : appms ] ) , the ratio of the quark condensates could be linked to the ratio of the hadron masses at low density : @xmath104 this relation suggests that the ratio of the effective hadron mass to the free one does not always scale as @xmath105  @xcite . at small density",
    "we could expect eq.([eq : rela ] ) , ( [ eq : rela2 ] ) and @xmath106 rather than the naive @xmath107 scaling .",
    "we have applied the quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model to investigate the density dependence of the properties of hadrons and the quark condensates in dense nuclear matter ( up to four times the normal nuclear density ) .",
    "we have calculated not only the variations in the nucleon properties in medium but also those in the masses of the vector ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) mesons and the hyperons ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) .",
    "as several authors have suggested  @xcite , the hadron mass is reduced due to the change of the scalar mean - field in medium . in the present model",
    "the hadron mass can be related to the number of non - strange quarks and the strength of the scalar mean - field .",
    "the hadron masses are simply connected to one another , and the relationship among them is given by eq.([eq : rela ] ) , which is effective over a wide range of the nuclear density .",
    "furthermore , the ratio of the quark condensate in medium to that in vacuum can be related to the vector - meson mass and the nucleon properties  eg . ,",
    "@xmath46 and @xmath47  in medium .    finally , we would like to give a few caveats concerning the present calculation .",
    "the basic idea of the model is that the mesons are locally coupled to the quarks .",
    "this is certainly common for pions in models like the chiral or cloudy bag  @xcite , but may be less justified for heavier mesons like the vector mesons , which are obviously not collective states .",
    "the model also omits the effect of short - range correlations among the quarks . at very high density",
    "these would be expected to dominate .",
    "furthermore , the pionic cloud of the hadron  @xcite should be considered explicitly in any truly quantitative study of the hadron properties in medium .",
    "as we mentioned at the end of sec .",
    "ii , the contribution of meson exchange currents in medium is also important and should be considered in a consistent manner .",
    "finally , we note that subtleties such as scalar - vector mixing in medium and the splitting between longitudinal and transverse masses of the vector mesons  @xcite have been ignored in the present mean - field study .",
    "although the former appears to be quite small in qhd the latter will certainly be important in any attempt to actually measure the mass shift .",
