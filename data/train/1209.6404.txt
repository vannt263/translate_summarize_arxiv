    "quantum dots have been studied extensively as potential quantum network nodes @xcite , and upconversion of single photons from quantum dots has been demonstrated @xcite . however , generation of noise photons , as well as the absence of coherent control in those experiments , have limited the utility of the qfc technique for quantum networks with solid - state matter qubits where resonant excitation is required . in this paper , we report a low - noise downconversion quantum interface , in which 910-nm single photons from a quantum dot are downconverted to the 1.5-@xmath0 m lowest - loss telecom band , showing near - perfect preservation of antibunched photon statistics under coherent quantum dot spin control .",
    "these results represent a critical step towards a long - distance hybrid quantum network @xcite , in which subsystems operating at different wavelengths are connected through qfc devices and 1.5-@xmath0 m quantum channels .",
    "the development of a long - distance hybrid quantum network faces many challenges .",
    "perhaps foremost among them is an interface between coherently controlled matter qubits ( which typically have optical transitions in the visible or near - visible spectral range ) and low - loss photonic quantum channels based on transmission through optical fiber .",
    "quantum frequency conversion enables such an interface . in this work",
    "we demonstrate a qfc scheme whereby single photons emitted from a quantum dot , at a wavelength of 910 nm , are downconverted to the 1.5-@xmath0 m lowest - loss telecom band , while the emitted photons are temporally and spectrally shaped by the converter .",
    "qfc has enjoyed renewed interest since the development of upconversion - assisted single - photon detectors at 1.5 @xmath0 m : the use of periodically poled lithium niobate ( ppln ) waveguides with internal conversion efficiencies exceeding 99.99% ( with extraction efficiencies of @xmath390% limited by waveguide propagation losses ) for pump powers on the order of 100 mw @xcite .",
    "there has been recent work on extending qfc for use in downconversion , with experimental efforts focusing on various systems including quantum dots and color centers in diamond @xcite , as well as heralded single photons from spontaneous parametric downconversion , in which entanglement properties were shown to be preserved upon downconversion @xcite .",
    "our use of a pulsed pump to shape the single - photon wavepacket is a downconversion analog to the technique used in @xcite to demonstrate fast amplitude modulation of single - photons via upconversion , and in @xcite to achieve high - time - resolution upconversion - based detection . to the best of our knowledge",

    "a portion of the rotation laser power was picked off and combined with a strong 1565-nm laser to produce picosecond - pulsed 2.2-@xmath0 m radiation used as the pump for the downconversion process .",
    "single photons emitted via decay from @xmath5 to @xmath8 were collected and downconverted in the ppln waveguide with poling period @xmath9  @xmath0 m .",
    "the resulting 1560-nm downconverted photons were detected on a superconducting nanowire single - photon detector ( snspd ) . ]",
    "there are two telecom bands of interest for long - distance fiber - based quantum networks : the spectral regions near either 1.3 or 1.5 @xmath0 m , which have propagation losses of 0.34 or 0.19 db / km , respectively @xcite .",
    "while several qfc experiments have focused on the 1.3-@xmath0 m window @xcite , an interface to the 1.5-@xmath0 m band would enable nearly double the transmission distance of a 1.3-@xmath0 m interface .",
    "one difficulty with the construction of a 1.5-@xmath0 m interface is that to avoid large noise counts due to spontaneous scattering processes of the strong classical pump , the pump wavelength must be substantially longer than that of the converted signal @xcite .",

    "the pump and signal were combined into the interaction region containing the qpm grating using an integrated wdm coupler @xcite based on a directional coupler in which the pump radiation evanescently couples from one waveguide of the coupler to the other , while the signal ( due to its smaller mode size ) does not couple .",
    "following the interaction region , an additional smf-28 fiber was pigtailed to collect the generated radiation at @xmath18 .",

    "the peak internal conversion efficiency of the downconversion waveguide was estimated to be approximately 80% , limited by the waveguide propagation losses of approximately 0.2 db / cm , and occurred for peak powers ( in the input fiber ) of approximately 3 w. we note that the power for maximum conversion is higher than in previous qfc experiments using similar waveguides due to higher losses observed at @xmath17 : we observed a total loss of 7 db at @xmath17 , which includes both input coupling losses and an absorption loss of approximately 1 db / cm at 2.2-@xmath0 m .",
    "the absorption loss results from the tail of an oh@xmath19 vibration - libration resonance in linbo@xmath2 , which was enhanced due to the intentional proton doping to form the waveguide @xcite .      the quantum dot sample used in this work was similar to devices used previously for coherent manipulation and all - optical spin - echo experiments @xcite .",

    "we have not measured the @xmath32 autocorrelation of the generated radiation at the target wavelength because our low count rates would have entailed prohibitively long integration times .",
    "however , due to the very low noise involved in the conversion process and the observations of other authors @xcite , we are confident that the single - photon character of the quantum dot emission is preserved upon downconversion .        to demonstrate the compatibility of our downconversion interface with coherent control , we performed two rabi oscillation experiments .",
    "rabi oscillations indicate that one can perform coherent rotations on a qubit around a single axis .",
    "first , we rotated between @xmath25 and @xmath5 using the excitation laser , and second , we rotated between @xmath8 and @xmath25 using the spin - rotation laser @xcite .",
    "the optical - excitation rabi oscillations , observed directly at 910 nm , are shown as blue dots in fig .",

    "[ fig:4](a ) and ( b ) ) , shown on the same vertical scale as the 910-nm data .",
    "as is expected for rabi oscillations , we observe maxima ( minima ) in the detected photon counts as the state is rotated through odd ( even ) integer multiples of @xmath37 .",
    "detailed , quantitative understanding of the control dynamics of the spin system has been reported previously @xcite ; we indicate fits to the 910-nm data ( blue curves ) as a guide to the eye , in good qualitative agreement with the aforementioned models .",
    "we have demonstrated low - noise downconversion of single photons emitted from a coherently controlled quantum dot to the 1.5-@xmath0 m telecommunications band .",
    "the use of picosecond conversion pulses temporally shapes the downconverted emission from the quantum dot .",
    "the resulting time resolution has enabled the generation and verification of telecom - band spin - photon entanglement @xcite , which in the qd system requires time resolution well below 50 ps , which would be challenging using presently available single - photon detectors .",
    "due to the temporal mismatch between the spontaneous emission lifetime ( 600 ps ) and conversion window ( 610 ps ) , relatively few of the emitted photons were converted in this experiment .",
    "similar spectral and temporal shaping , with higher overall efficiency , could be accomplished through the use of a long chirped pump pulse , followed by pulse compression using standard techniques @xcite .",
    "specifically , the use of pump pulses with durations matched to the spontaneous emission lifetime would yield an approximately 60-fold improvement in the detected downconverted photon rate , to approximately @xmath38 . without the losses due to the temporal overlap factor",
    ", our external conversion efficiency would be approximately 24% ( including all losses due to the output filters ) or 40% ( excluding the filter losses ) .    in future work",
    ", the use of two frequency converters with two pump wavelengths would enable high - fidelity telecom - band interference of photons from quantum dots with different transition frequencies , without resort o temperature or electric - field tuning of the qd transition frequencies @xcite . by tuning the pump frequency ,",
