    "an impurity interacting strongly with a background gas is a paradigm of many - body physics @xcite .",
    "this problem has recently attracted great interest due to experimental advances where interactions , mass imbalance and even the dimensionality of the system can be controlled , thus allowing a clean platform to study various properties . up to now , a handful of states such as the _ polaron _",
    "@xcite , dressed dimer or _ dimeron _",
    "@xcite , and _ trimeron _ @xcite have been studied ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "they can be best understood as quasiparticles : few - body states dressed by particle - hole fluctuations of the fermi sea whose vacuum properties are qualitatively preserved in the gas .",
    "surprisingly , for the polaron , a simple variational calculation @xcite with only one particle - hole dressing gives very accurate results compared with more sophisticated monte carlo calculations @xcite and can be extended to study other possible states of the system . for example , away from the unitary regime and approaching the bec side ( fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) , the impurity binds one particle from the fermi sea and forms a dimeron ground state @xcite . the trimeron becomes the ground state if the ratio of the masses of the impurity to that of the fermi sea atoms is above a critical mass ratio @xcite .",
    "the polaron , dimeron and trimeron have well - defined vacuum limits when the density of the background gas tends to zero ( the bare impurity , dimer and trimer ) @xcite .",
    "therefore it is interesting to ask whether there are states which do not have a well - defined vacuum limit .",
    "a new such class would be bound states where holes play an essential role ( beyond being part of the particle - hole dressing ) .",
    "for example , a bound state of the impurity with a hole could not be interpreted as such in the low density limit but its excitonic - type physics would come into play at nonzero densities .",
    "it is interesting to study this possibility in this context ; excitonic states are , of course , well known already in charged systems , particularly in solid state @xcite .    in this paper , we study variationaly the simplest case of an impurity bound with a single hole ( an _ exciton _ ) within a two - channel model characterised by a scattering length and effective range in 3d and",
    "compare its energy with that of the polaron and dimeron ( see fig.[f1 ] ) .",
    "we find that the exciton is not the ground state and calculate its decay rates to the polaronic and dimeronic branches , finding that it is a long - lived quasiparticle .",
    "an important consequence is that the existence of the exciton gives rise to an exciton - particle continuum in inverse - rf measurements which overlaps with the already known dimeron - hole continuum ( @xcite ) as we see in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] . as a consequence ,",
    "it is likely that part of the spectral weight of the continuum measured in that experiment and identified as dimeron - hole was most likely of the exciton - particle type instead .    .",
    "we consider an atomic impurity of mass @xmath2 immersed in a spin polarized fermi gas of mass @xmath3 .",
    "the interaction between the impurity and the background atoms is tunable through an s - wave feshbach resonance described by a two - channel model and the interactions between the background atoms can be neglected at low temperatures .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the system is given by ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath4   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "+ \\frac{g}{\\sqrt{v}}\\sum_{\\mathbf{k , k'}}(\\hat{b}_{\\mathbf{k+k'}}^{\\dagger}\\hat{u}_{\\mathbf{k'}}\\hat{d}_{\\mathbf{k}}+\\rm{h.c.})\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where the coupling of the impurity and a background atom into the closed channel molecule is described by @xmath5 . here @xmath6 ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) creates a background atom ( an impurity and a closed channel molecule ) with wave vector @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath10 obey the usual fermionic anticommutation relations @xmath11 and the statistics of the impurity and the molecule are irrelevant since there is at most one impurity and one closed channel molecule in the system .",
    "we define @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the internal energy of the molecule . the bare parameters @xmath5 and @xmath15 of the hamiltonian are related to the physical parameters , scattering length @xmath16 and effective range of the resonance @xmath17 as @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the reduced mass .",
    "to describe the excitonic state of momentum @xmath20 of the impurity in the fermi sea , we use the grand canonical ensemble @xcite and consider the variational wave function with one particle - hole dressing , @xmath21 is the zero - temperature noninteracting fermi sea of background atoms with a fermi energy @xmath22 and wave vector @xmath23 . here , @xmath24 means that the summation of the hole momentum @xmath25 is restricted to @xmath26 while the particle momentum is restricted to @xmath27 .",
    "the equations that determine the polaron , dimeron and exciton energies are given in the large system limit by the minimisation of @xmath28 , @xmath29 being the total number operator for background atoms . setting the zero of the energy at that of the grand canonical energy of a gas of noninteracting atoms with the same @xmath30 , we get @xmath31 where the various quantities in the above equations are defined as @xmath32    @xmath33    and @xmath34 for polaron , exciton and dimeron respectively . note that the energy equation of polaron is algebraic while that for the exciton and dimeron are integral equations . from the above equations , we can extract the exciton , polaron and dimeron energies as a function of various parameters , like , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath35 ( see @xcite ) . in the next section we will consider the cases with @xmath36 .     with different mass @xmath35 and resonance parameter @xmath37 .",
    "panels ( a1)-(a3 ) show the energies when @xmath38 at three different masses @xmath39 where the binding energy @xmath40 has been subtracted for clarity .",
    "the dots mark the crossing points .",
    "panels ( b1)-(b3 ) show the energies when @xmath41 . ]",
    "in fig . [ f2 ] we present the energies of the exciton compared with that of the polaron and dimeron as a function of @xmath42 at different @xmath35 and @xmath43 .",
    "panel a(2 ) of fig.[f2 ] shows the calculations with equal mass ( @xmath44 ) and in the wide resonance limit ( @xmath45 ) , where the energies of the polaron and dimeron have been studied previously @xcite .",
    "the energies of the polaron and dimeron cross at @xmath46 while that of the exciton and polaron cross at @xmath47 . increasing the mass ratio @xmath35 , as in fig.[f2 ] ( a3 ) where @xmath48 , the critical values of @xmath49 for polaron - dimeron and exciton - polaron crossings both decrease , but the exciton energy is alway higher than that of the dimeron .",
    "the situation changes when the mass of the impurity is lighter than that of the atoms of the fermi sea , as in fig.[f2 ] ( a1 ) where @xmath50 and the exciton and dimeron energies cross at @xmath51 , though the polaron energy is lower than that of the exciton at this scale .",
    "[ f2 ] ( b1)-(b3 ) shows the energies of the three states when the resonance becomes narrow ( @xmath52 ) . in this case , the energy curves of the dimeron and exciton become essentially flat around unitarity and the exciton energy is alway higher than that of the dimeron for all three mass ratios of @xmath53 . from this",
    "we see that the exciton is never the ground state but is a resonance whose lifetime we discuss below .    because we are studying variationaly a quasiparticle which is not the lowest energy state ( as was the case of the repulsive polaron in @xcite )",
    ", we should check that ansatz ( [ excitoneq ] ) is indeed describing a new quasiparticle and not some trivial combination of other known ones which are also included in the hilbert space spanned by the ansatz .",
    "for example , it might describe a polaron plus a hole or ( if the first term in ( [ excitoneq ] ) were zero ) a dimeron plus two holes .",
    "the energy of the latter two states is approximately given by the sum of the energies of the quasiparticles ( e.g. polaron energy plus hole energy ) with the constraint of zero total momentum .",
    "we argue as follows : if we look at panels ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) of fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , we see that , in the first case , the exciton has lower energy than the dimeron for values smaller than @xmath54 .",
    "therefore its state for @xmath50 and for all @xmath55 is not trivial combination of the dimeron plus two holes which is of equal or higher energy . in the central panel",
    ", we can similarly argue that the exciton is lower in energy than the state of a polaron plus a hole for @xmath44 since its energy is lower than that of a polaron for @xmath56 .",
    "it follows then that , in the @xmath57 plane , the exciton eigenstate is not trivial combination of those two states everywhere by continuity .",
    "clearly , it will also not be trivial combination of other states that are included in the hilbert space spanned by ( [ excitoneq ] ) such as a  cooper pair \" ( dimer without dressing ) plus two holes or single impurity plus hole since these are higher in energy than the dimeron or polaron respectively . from this",
    "we conclude that the exciton is indeed a new quasiparticle .",
    "the variational approach is strictly speaking valid for eigenstates of the system , usually the ground state .",
    "the exciton however is not the ground state but a resonance so , while the variational method can be applied in a restricted hilbert space as we have argued , it might be useful to present its diagrammatic formulation .",
    "the resonance appears in the impurity - hole t - matrix at positive energy and total momentum @xmath58 as in ( [ excitoneq ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] we show the diagrams corresponding to ansatz ( [ excitoneq ] ) , i.e. including at most two particle - hole lines at any given time .",
    "we also see that intermediate states correspond to the repeated scattering of a polaron and a hole .",
    "these diagrams represent all possible intermediate states which span the two - particle hole hilbert space of the variational ansatz and are therefore equivalent to it .",
    "they also illustrate that the exciton is a true resonance , not just a combination of a polaron and a hole since it requires interaction between the two .",
    "a similar type of diagrams were considered in @xcite .",
    "however they were interested in the equal spin population case and did not consider the polaronic dressing of the impurity lines .    ) . ]    since the exciton is not the ground state of the system , the excitonic states can be a long lived quasiparticle at best since they can decay to a dimeron or polaron .",
    "if the lifetime is long enough , then we will be able to speak of a new quasiparticle , the exciton , opening a new regime of metastable physics ( similarly to the repulsive polaron which is also not the ground state but can still be observed experimentally due to its sufficiently long lifetime and has actually already been studied experimentally by several groups recently @xcite ) .",
    "thus the exciton is a resonance in the scattering of the impurity with a hole , which appears as a pole at the complex energy @xmath59 in the scattering amplitude .",
    "the real part of the pole corresponds approximately to the exciton energy calculated by the variational ansatz .",
    "the important question then becomes - what is the imaginary part of the pole , i.e. , what is the lifetime of the exciton ? as discussed above , these processes require a larger hilbert space than that of the variational ansatz .",
    "[ f2 ] shows that all three quasiparticles can decay into each other .",
    "the feynman diagrams for these processes are shown in fig .",
    "the decay rate @xmath60 ( decay from  @xmath61 \" to  @xmath62 \" ) is determined by the imaginary part of the corresponding self energy insertions @xmath63 ( the part of the diagram without external legs ) , i.e. , @xmath64 @xcite . while the decay rates between polaron and dimeron have been calculated at zero @xcite and finite momentum @xcite we will focus on the decay rates of the exciton to the dimeron and polaron . however , for completeness in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] we also show the diagrams for the decay between the polaron and dimeron .",
    "we first calculate the decay rates from exciton to dimeron , in which process a zero momentum exciton decays to a dimeron and two holes so that the decay rate involves a sum over the hole final momenta .",
    "the frequency sums in the two diagrams can be performed by contour integration which amounts to evaluating the frequencies at the on - shell energies @xcite . using a pole expansion of the dimeron and polaron propagator , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , with @xmath67 and @xmath68 the corresponding residues and effective masses , we find ( from the imaginary part of the two self - energy insertions @xcite ) , @xmath69 ^ 2\\nonumber \\\\ \\delta\\left(\\delta \\omega_d^e+\\xi_q^u+\\xi_{q'}^u-\\frac{(\\mathbf{q+q'})^2}{2m_d^*}\\right )   \\sim ( \\delta \\omega_d^e)^4 \\label{emdecay}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "it is interesting to note that without the matrix element term @xmath72 ^ 2 $ ] , the decay rate scales as @xmath73 , so the fermi antisymmetry when swapping the two hole momenta @xmath25 and @xmath74 gives an additional factor @xmath75 to the decay rate .",
    "this is very different from the case of decay rate between polaron and dimeron where the fermi antisymmetry only gives @xmath76 @xcite due to the absence of an additional particle from the fermi sea as a result of the decay . from a similar calculation for the decay of the dimeron to exciton , we find @xmath77 .",
    "we then proceed to the calculations of the decay rates from exciton to polaron , in which a zero momentum exciton decays into a polaron , a particle and two holes ( the energy threshold for decay into a polaron and hole is higher ) .",
    "the two diagrams in the second column of fig .",
    "[ f4 ] yield the following expression , @xmath78 ^ 2 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\hspace{-0.1cm}\\delta\\left(\\delta \\omega_p^e+\\xi_q^u+\\xi_{q'}^u-\\xi_{k}^u-\\frac{(\\mathbf{q+q'-k})^2}{2m_p^*}\\right )   \\sim ( \\delta \\omega_p^e)^{5.5 } \\label{epdecay}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "again , we find without the matrix element term the above expression would give a scaling @xmath82 , so the fermi antisymmetry when swapping the two hole momenta @xmath25 and @xmath74 also gives an additional factor @xmath75 to the decay rate",
    ". this may be a unique feature of the exciton physics in this setup .",
    "a similar analysis of the two diagrams of the polaron to exciton decay gives @xmath83 .",
    "the scalings of the decay rates among the three states are summarised in the last column of fig . .",
    "these scaling laws with high powers are interesting theoretical results on their own and imply very long quasiparticle lifetimes as compared with the usual quadratic scaling @xmath84 of the quasiparticle decay rates of a normal landau fermi liquid ( for the physics of low power laws , such as @xmath76 or even frequency independent decay rates , see @xcite ) , and will open a new regime of metastable physics in fermi gases for experimental explorations @xcite . relating our scaling laws to experiments , we can estimate the exciton lifetime , for example at the exciton - polaron crossing point @xmath85 of fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ( a2 ) . at the crossing point ,",
    "the decay of exciton to polaron will vanish , though the exciton can decay to dimeron with an energy difference of @xmath86 .",
    "using @xmath87 @xcite and assuming @xmath88 , we find the prefactor of the scaling law by doing the integral ( [ emdecay ] ) numerically , resulting in @xmath89 ( for a fermi energy of @xmath90 , the lifetime is @xmath91 ) , which is the typical scale of the repulsive polaron as measured in @xcite . relating this decay rate to the corresponding energy shift of the excitonic state ( @xmath92 ) , we find @xmath93 , which shows that the excitonic state exists as a well defined , metastable quasiparticle in this case .",
    "while the excitonic state is not the ground state at least for some parameter values , its long lifetime adds new ingredients to the metastable physics previously known ( e.g. , repulsive polaron ) .",
    "an interesting result obtained here is that the fermi antisymmetry when swapping the two hole momenta @xmath25 and @xmath74 gives an additional factor @xmath75 to the exciton decay rates in contrast with the previously studied decay rates between polaron and dimeron where only an additional factor @xmath94 was found .",
    "our study opens many interesting directions since it emphasises hole excitations as an integral part of few - body states in the gas .",
    "it naturally leads to questions about states with more than a single hole , and to analogies with solid state systems even though in the latter , the physics has qualitatively different aspects due to the quasiparticle charge .",
    "an interesting question is whether the exciton can be the ground state in closely related systems .",
    "for example , in 2d @xcite , integrals over hole momenta are more important ; also , one could think of other states such as p - wave polarons and dimerons @xcite or dipolar impurity systems @xcite and even impurities with spin - orbit couplings @xcite .",
    "further studies will also be needed to clarify how to couple the impurity with the excitonic states while having negligible coupling with the dimeronic or polaronic states by inverse rf ( radio - frequency ) process which will allow us to probe the excitonic states directly .",
