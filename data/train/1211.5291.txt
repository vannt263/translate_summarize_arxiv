    "the 10th magnitude star ae for ( cd -25 1273 ; hip 14568 ) was first classified by @xcite as a k4 dwarf . in the hipparcos catalogue",
    "@xcite it was listed as a new eclipsing variable of algol type with a period of 0.918235(8 )  d , and a parallax of 32.10@xmath01.78  mas .",
    "the latter was revised in 2007 to the presently adopted 31.8@xmath01.96  mas @xcite , corresponding to 31.5@xmath01.9  pc .",
    "@xcite found the star to be a double - lined binary with balmer lines in emission .",
    "emission in balmer and ca ii h & k lines was also observed by @xcite , who estimated the spectral type of ae for at k9 ve , and classified it as a very active system . a slightly earlier spectral type ( k7  ve ) was assigned to ae for by @xcite , who also noted its high activity . according to zasche , svoboda & uhl ( 2012 ; hereafter zsu ) , the system contains a brown dwarf with a minimal mass of @xmath647 @xmath7 on an eccentric orbit of @xmath67 years .    in the solar neighborhood about 7 per cent of detached eclipsing binaries are x - ray emitters @xcite . with its",
    "@xmath8  erg  s@xmath9 @xcite and @xmath10 @xcite , ae for is a prominent member of this group . in the catalogue of @xcite",
    "it is one of the closest x - ray active binaries , whose @xmath11 ratio reaches 0.01 @xcite .",
    "an x - ray flaring activity of the system was reported by @xcite .",
    "it is also a bright ir source , with 2mass magnitudes @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .    for about a decade it has been known that active dwarfs of k and m type tend to be larger and cooler than the theory predicts .",
    "while possible solutions of this problem have been proposed ( see e.g. morales , ribas & jordi 2008 and references therein ) , it is certainly worthwhile to enlarge the relevant observational databasis .",
    "the best opportunity for this is offered by detached binaries on the lower main sequence , which allow to determine masses and radii of their components with an accuracy better than 1 per cent .",
    "ae for is clearly one of such systems , however until very recently neither the light curve nor the velocity curve of this potentially interesting binary has been studied .",
    "a preliminary light - curve solution has been derived by zsu , who concluded that a spectroscopic analysis was needed to confirm the physical parameters of the components to a higher accuracy .    in the present paper",
    "we obtain and analyze the velocity curve of ae for , and refine the photometric solution of zsu based on additional observations .",
    "the photometric and spectroscopic data are described in sects . 2 and 3 .",
    "the analysis of the data is detailed in sect . 4 , and its results are discussed in sect .",
    "the observational material consists of our own @xmath15 data and @xmath16 data of zsu ( see table  [ tab : obsphot ] for details ) .",
    "our data were collected during 11 nights between 2009 dec 8/9 and dec 18/19 with the 1-m swope telescope at las campanas observatory ( lco ) , chile .",
    "all the nights were clear , with the seeing between 1.1 and 2.5  arcsec .",
    "ae for was monitored with the @xmath17  pixel site3 ccd camera at a scale of 0.435  arcsec / pixel .",
    "we collected 482 frames through the @xmath18 filter with exposure times 5 - 10  s ( depending on the seeing ) , and 160 frames in the @xmath19 filter with exposure times 8 - 25  s. all images were de - biased and flat - fielded within the iraf    for photometric measurements the daophot package @xcite was employed , and differential aperture photometry was extracted using two stars in the vicinity of ae  for . on every night ae  for was observed we also observed ngc 2204 . for six red clump stars of the latter we found the offset between instrumental magnitudes and the standard @xmath15 magnitudes determined by @xcite . using that offset together with the average extinction for lco ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ;",
    "see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and accounting for a 0.04 difference in air - mass between ae for and ngc 2204 , we transformed the instrumental light curves of the variable to the standard @xmath15 system .",
    "color terms of the transformation were accounted for .",
    "we estimate the error of this transformation at @xmath00.02  mag , its main source being the uncertainty of the zero - point for ngc 2204 .",
    "the formal error of the differential photometry is about ten times smaller ."
