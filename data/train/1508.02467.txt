    "the idea of a quantum simulator , where a complex many - body quantum system is emulated in a controlled analog quantum computer and the results of the simulation are read off of the computer by measuring different properties as a function of time , originates with work from richard feynman  @xcite in the early 1980s .",
    "cirac and zoller  @xcite showed how ion traps driven by a spin - dependent optical dipole force could realize quantum computers .",
    "porras and cirac  @xcite further described how one could perform quantum simulations in a penning trap .",
    "one of the issues with these quantum simulations is that the ions are not spaced uniformly . on the one hand , this leads to nonuniform effective spin - spin couplings between the ions , on the other hand , in one - dimensional linear paul traps , it leads to the linear to zig - zag transition , which limits the number of ions that can be held in the trap in a one - dimensional linear configuration .",
    "it was quickly realized that by adding an anharmonic potential , which pushes together the farther out ions preferentially when compared to the central ions , one can achieve a more uniform arrangement , and the precise potential for perfectly uniform trapping is known for the linear paul trap  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , one can achieve quite uniform crystals by just adding a quartic potential on top of the conventional quadratic trapping potential .",
    "this ideology has been extended to the penning trap by dubin  @xcite , where he also included a triangular - shaped rotating wall potential to reduce dislocation formation , which occurs in two - dimensional penning traps when the boundary potential does not have the same symmetry of the underlying ionic lattice .    in this paper , we extend the analysis of dubin to determine the behavior of different numbers of trapped ions , different wall potentials and different rotation rates , to determine the stability of these ionic crystals .",
    "we further calculate the axial phonon modes and from them the effective spin - spin interactions induced by a state - dependent optical dipole force .",
    "we end by discussing the feasibility of the triangular wall for quantum simulation with ionic crystals in the penning trap .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we describe the theoretical background for the calculations . in sec .",
    "iii , we present the numerical results for the calculations of the spin - spin couplings of the ions . in sec .",
    "iv , we present our conclusions .",
    "the penning trap confines ions by using an electrostatic potential that pushes the ions towards the plane with @xmath0 , and also pushes the ions outwards , radially . a large static magnetic field curves the radial motion into circles , which result in a trapped ion crystal ( after taking into account the coulomb repulsion of each ion ) .",
    "an additional rotating wall potential , with specified angular symmetry , is then applied to control the shape of the crystal and its rotation rate . while many different ions can be employed in a penning trap",
    ", we will focus on the realization with two hyperfine levels of @xmath1be@xmath2 ions , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , localized to a single plane .",
    "an extensive description of such a set - up can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "cold atoms condensing in such crystals are candidates for building quantum simulators , owing to the ease with which these systems can be prepared for large number of ions , and the precise quantum control of individual ions these systems afford  @xcite .    in actual experiments ,",
    "the ionic crystal often acquires an increasing number of impurities as a function of time , such as beh@xmath5 that form due to collisions of the beryllium ions with hydrogen molecules that are in the dilute background gas . while a theoretical treatment that includes the effect of these impurities is possible  @xcite",
    ", we consider only the clean limit here , where there are no impurities .",
    "this simplifies the analysis below . in addition",
    ", experimental protocols to purify the systems may make this effect less important  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical treatment of the equilibrium positions and normal modes of the penning trap requires a careful analysis employing standard classical mechanics and then an appropriate quantization scheme .",
    "details for how to do this have already appeared  @xcite . here , we provide a quick summary of that formalism to establish our notation and to show how the approach needs to be modified for the more uniform triangular crystals that can be generated in an extra anharmonic potential with a rotating triangular wall .",
    "we begin with the ion lagrangian in the laboratory reference frame which satisfies @xmath6 \\label{eq : lagrangian}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the total number of ions , @xmath8 is the ( positive ) unit charge of an electron and @xmath9 is the mass of a @xmath1be@xmath5 ion .",
    "the symbol @xmath10 is the position vector for the @xmath11th ion in cartesian coordinates , @xmath12 is the total scalar potential acting on the @xmath11th ion ( including the rotating wall potential ) , and @xmath13 is the vector potential in the symmetric gauge for the uniform axial magnetic field @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "the scalar potential @xmath16 includes the potentials that trap the ions and the mutual coulomb repulsion between the ions .",
    "it can be expressed as follows : @xmath17 + \\frac{1}{2 }   m\\omega_{eff}^{2}c_4\\rho_{j}^{4}\\nonumber \\\\ & + &   v_{w}\\rho_{j}^{3}\\cos[3(\\theta_{j}+\\omega t ) ] + \\frac{k_{e}e^2}{2}\\sum_{k\\not = j } \\frac{1}{r_{kj } } \\label{eq : scalar_potential}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the effective trapping frequency in the rotating frame of the crystal with @xmath19 ( see below ) , @xmath20 is the amplitude of the static quadratic potential from the penning trap electrodes , @xmath21 is the strength of the additional fourth - order anharmonic trapping potential ( also coming from the penning trap electrodes ) , @xmath22 is the amplitude of the triangular rotating wall potential , @xmath23 is the rotating wall angular frequency ( which rotates about the @xmath24-axis ) , and @xmath25 is the coulomb force constant . here , @xmath26 is the interparticle distance between the @xmath27th and @xmath11th ion and is given by @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the polar coordinate radius for the @xmath11th ion and is given by @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the polar angular coordinate for the @xmath11th ion which is given by @xmath32 .",
    "the rotating wall potential makes the potential @xmath33 time - dependent in the laboratory frame .",
    "the solution for the ion positions is simplified by transforming to the equivalent equilibrium problem in the rotating frame with angular speed @xmath34 ( where the effective trapping potential becomes time - independent ) . transforming to the rotating frame",
    ", we arrive at the following time - independent rotating - frame potential for the @xmath11th ion ( which is confined to the plane with @xmath35 : @xmath36 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & v_{w } [ ( x_{j}^{r } ) ^{3 } - 3 x_{j}^{r } ( y_{j}^{r})^2 ] + \\frac{k_ee^2}{2 } \\sum_{k\\not = j } \\frac{1}{r_{jk}^{r } } \\label{eq : potential_rot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the transformed set of coordinates for the rotating frame .",
    "the @xmath34-dependence of the effective trapping frequency is due to the way velocities transform for rotating frames , which now includes the effects of potential terms from the centrifugal and lorentz forces as well .    comparing eq .",
    "( [ eq : potential_rot ] ) with a similar expression appearing in ref .",
    ", we see the following differences : ( i ) there is an additional anharmonic , fourth - order term that causes the ions in the outer regions of the crystal to be pushed in more strongly , and hence counteracts some of the inhomogeneities that occur due to increasing interion distances as we move outwards ; ( ii ) the angular shape of the rotating wall term has now been adjusted to an @xmath38 angular harmonic as the crystal condenses into a triangular lattice and there is less frustration at the edges if the rotating wall has a symmetry that matches that of the underlying crystal facets  @xcite .",
    "we note that the additional / modified terms retain their form under a transformation from the laboratory frame to the rotating frame .",
    "we also remark that the unconventional choice of @xmath39 ( with the coefficient dependent on @xmath34 ) for the anharmonic term was made in anticipation of the simpler and rather standard form we get in eq .",
    "( [ eq : potential_rot ] ) .",
    "the ions in a penning trap crystal do not always crystallize in a two - dimensional plane .",
    "the following approximate criterion is usually required to be satisfied for a planar only configuration : @xmath40 which basically ensures that the restoring force in the axial direction is several orders of magnitude bigger than in the radial direction , and the crystal lies in the @xmath0 plane only .",
    "the triangular rotating wall also introduces an anisotropy in the radial potential , with deconfinement along certain directions which , if strong enough , can lead to particle loss . for the more familiar case of @xmath41 ,",
    "this is reflected in the increasing eccentricity of the elliptical equilibrium structures that suggests deconfinement along the `` weak '' axis .",
    "this is expressed in terms of an approximate criteria in ref .   for the simplest rotating wall . for @xmath38",
    ", this becomes difficult to express in terms of a single criterion and we resort to a numerical calculation to find the triangular `` separatrix '' , the contour lines of the radial part of the gradient of the potential function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : potential_rot ] ) , with the coulomb repulsion terms ignored .",
    "these are shown for varying ratios of strengths of the rotating wall term to the effective radial confinement strength , @xmath42 in fig .",
    "[ fig : separatrix ] .",
    "we notice that unlike the quadrupole rotating wall potential , deconfinement happens for the triangular wall at large enough distances for all wall amplitude strengths .",
    "we see that as the strength of the triangular rotating wall increases , the separatrix moves closer to the center of symmetry of the crystal , with apparent deconfinement centered along the @xmath43 and @xmath44 axes .",
    "this has a noticeable effect on the `` shape '' of the penning - trap crystals , which reduces the dislocations in the crystal and helps maintain the uniformity .",
    "of course , a full description of stability of these planar structures requires inclusion of the coulomb terms .",
    "the accurate quantitative description of stability requires solving for the equilibrium positions presupposing a planar arrangement of ions , and then showing that the eigenvalues of the normal modes of oscillation about these equilibrium positions are all positive ; that is , the phonon normal mode frequencies are all real .",
    "the full , transformed lagrangian for the rotating frame is @xmath45 \\label{eq : lagrangian_rot}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the @xmath34-dependent effective magnetic field in the rotating frame .",
    "the modification of the magnetic field is due to velocity dependent terms in the laboratory frame lagrangian .",
    "this affects the oscillating normal modes of the planar motion when the ions are far from their equilibrium positions .",
    "however , as we will see soon , this does not have an effect on the axial modes .",
    "this observation greatly simplifies the normal - mode analysis for the axial modes .    to find the stable spatial configuration of the ions , we minimize the effective potential energy in the rotating frame of reference .",
    "this is a challenging optimization problem to solve for in two ( and higher dimensions ) , especially since different configurations , separated by large potential barriers , can have local minima in the potential energy function with small energy differences to the global minimum .",
    "we follow the previous treatments of this problem , where the experimental indication of the fact that the ions condense in a triangular lattice in a single plane is used to construct the optimized solution that lies close to a perfect triangular lattice .",
    "we construct an initial , trial solution based on the  closed - shell \" approximation as in ref .  , but with the important difference that the overall  shape \" is triangular and not hexagonal , as it was in the previous solutions .",
    "this is to reflect the fact that the overall shape of the crystal is dictated by the equipotential lines of the rotating wall term , which in this case is triangular .",
    "we then proceed to calculate the collective normal mode excitations of the crystal .",
    "the ion lagrangian ( in the rotating frame , all @xmath47 superscripts are dropped for clarity ) is expanded via a taylor series about the previously calculated equilibrium positions of the ions up to quadratic order .",
    "the ion coordinates are , for the purpose of the expansion , written as @xmath48 , while for the ion velocities we write @xmath49 .",
    "because we are expanding about equilibrium , we can drop the linear terms in the coordinates , and we find @xmath50 ^ 2 \\mathcal{l}\\,\\ , \\right|_{0 } \\label{eq : lagrangian_quadratic}\\ ] ] where the @xmath51 is due to the equilibrium state and the quadratic terms are due to fluctuations away from equilibrium , which we henceforth call @xmath52 for the phonon lagrangian .",
    "the lorentz force due to the external magnetic field lies in the @xmath53 plane , and the potential energy @xmath33 is clearly seen to be separable in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "this means that the axial phonon lagrangian can be decoupled from the planar phonon lagrangian , and there is no harmonic coupling between the planar and axial degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , we can study the axial and planar modes independently @xmath54 and we can solve just the equations of motion for the axial or the planar modes independent of the other ) .",
    "we examine only the axial modes in this work .",
    "this is due to the fact that the planar modes have a complex structure owing to a coupling of the ion motion in the @xmath55 and @xmath56 directions , the appearance of velocity - dependent forces , as well as complexities introduced by rotation of the ion crystals as observed in the laboratory frame .",
    "the fact that there is no harmonic coupling between axial and planar directions of the crystal allows us to exclude the planar modes from our discussion henceforth . restricting to the axial modes only ,",
    "is further supported by the fact that the simplest form of quantum simulation works on driving the axial modes with a state - dependent optical dipole force .    the axial lagrangian is then given by @xmath57 where the spring constants satisfy @xmath58 the absence of cross terms in the velocity part of the lagrangian can be easily seen from the sum - of - squares structure of the kinetic energy along the @xmath24-direction and the fact that there are no velocity - dependent forces in the @xmath24-direction .",
    "an explicit calculation for the matrix elements of the @xmath59 gives the following : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the distance between ions located at their respective equilibrium positions in the rotating frame .",
    "we see that the axial stiffness matrix is hermitian and symmetric , and is independent of the anharmonic or wall potentials .    to solve for the axial ion normal modes , we apply the euler - lagrange equations to the axial phonon lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lagrangian_axial ] ) : @xmath62 which , on substitution of the eigenvector solution _ ansatz _ @xmath63 $ ] , gives @xmath64~b_{k}^{z\\nu } = 0 , \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\ , j,\\nu=1,2,\\ldots n\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the normal mode eigenfrequency and @xmath66 is the @xmath67th axial normal - mode eigenvector .",
    "the eigenvalue problem is quadratic , but we can easily map it onto a linear eigenvalue problem by setting the eigenvalue according to @xmath68 .",
    "we can then solve for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors numerically in matlab .",
    "the eigenvectors @xmath69 are real , n - tuples whose norm has been set to unity by convention .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath70 are positive for stable normal modes and negative for unstable normal modes .",
    "the quantization of the normal modes is completely standard : we first identify the positions @xmath71 and momenta @xmath72 associated with each phonon mode as canonically conjugate , and promote the relation given by the poisson bracket @xmath73 to the commutation relation for the operators @xmath74 and @xmath75 , @xmath76 = i\\hbar\\delta_{\\nu\\nu'}$ ] . to calculate the canonically conjugate variables for the phonon modes",
    ", we make the transformation @xmath77 where @xmath78 are the normal coordinates for each phonon mode @xmath67 .",
    "we see that the lagrangian assumes the following diagonal form : @xmath79 hence , we calculate the conjugate momenta as follows : @xmath80 the hamiltonian is then expressed as @xmath81 to quantize the normal modes , we identify that the hamiltonian @xmath82 is a sum of simple harmonic modes with frequencies @xmath65 .",
    "we now introduce creation and annihilation operators as follows :    @xmath83    and @xmath84    hence , the quantized hamiltonian operator can be expressed as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the number operator .",

    "we now need to calculate the effective spin - spin coupling between the ions , generated by the spin - dependent optical dipole force .",
    "this analysis has been done in detail elsewhere  @xcite , which we utilize here .",
    "the effective spin hamiltonian is dictated by a time - dependent ising spin hamiltonian , @xmath88 where the ising spin - spin coupling between sites @xmath11 and @xmath89 is given by @xmath90 .",

    "if we plot the locus of points where this function becomes zero for various values of @xmath128 , we see that we get three regions , each centered along the @xmath129 axes . for increasing strength of the rotating wall potential , they move closer to the origin and the radius of the separatrix ( the smallest distance to these unstable zones along any axis )",
    "is seen to decrease .",
    "hence , the deconfinement increases for very high values of the rotating wall potential , which is what we expect . in our analysis",
    ", we stay in regions where the extent of crystal is much smaller than the separatrix radius .    , for parameterized values of the strength of the rotating wall potential ( given by @xmath130 , 0.608 , or 0.908 ) .",

    "the separatrix radius is roughly the shortest distance to the contour , from the center of the graph and we see that the separatrix radius decreases as we increase the strength of the rotating wall term .",
    "[ fig : separatrix ] ]    we also need to exclude unstable equilibrium configurations ( which are indicated by the nonpositivity of the eigenvalues @xmath70 of the stiffness matrices of the axial vibrations ) .",
    "we examine this in detail below , when we discuss our results on the axial phonon modes .    to find the equilibrium configurations , we need to minimize the hamiltonian of the crystal in the rotating frame , which boils down to finding the best minimum of the transformed potential function of eq .",

    "we only concentrate on the solution we obtain starting from the closed - shell construction . in this case , we start with a seed lattice where we arrange ions in closed , triangular shells while also respecting the triangular lattice symmetry .",

    "we arrive at the minima guaranteed under such a consideration of the seed lattice using a trust - region algorithm of the matlab optimization toolbox .",
    "the minimization procedure requires us to specify a locally calculated gradient of the potential , which can be input analytically by taking derivatives of the potential .",

    "[ fig : equilib ] ) .",
    "we obtain structures that form a nearly perfect triangular lattice close to the center , and smoothly transition to the shape of the contour lines of the effective potential as we move radially outward to the edges .",
    "the edge effects cause the interionic distances to change as we move outwards .",
    "our strategy to counter these effects are two - fold , as discussed earlier : ( i ) we introduce a weak anharmonic term whose strength is characterized by @xmath135 and ( ii ) we match the symmetry of the rotating wall with that of the condensed crystal . the first effect has been incorporated and fixed at a particular value , as discussed earlier . however , we keep the strength of the rotating wall variable as it is only for a certain range of values of the strength of the rotating wall potential that the contour lines of the effective potential are triangular , and hence become least likely to cause edge distortions of the ionic crystal .",

    "[ fig : equilib ] , where we show the progression of these structures for different values of the effective radial trapping strength @xmath124 , for @xmath136 and @xmath120 . for the low - strength rotating wall ,",
    "the structures ( a)-(d ) are nearly triangular and uniform , whereas the higher value of the rotating wall strength corresponds to the more distorted structures of ( e)-(h ) . for a fixed number of ions and fixed @xmath21 , we see the destabilizing effect of the decrease in separatrix radius with increasing rotating wall strength clearly on these crystal structures .",
    "we note here that in the limit of vanishing wall strength or high effective radial trapping frequency , the structures become more isotropic , with uniformly decreasing nearest - neighbor distances as we move towards the edges .",
    "the other extreme ( very small radial trapping frequency or high strength of rotating wall ) , the equilibrium configuration we obtain from a closed - shell construction shows that the ions are reduced to ( three ) pockets of stability and the structure is no longer closed . a detailed normal - mode analysis ( see below ) shows that these structures are in unstable equilibrium , and hence we can discard them .",
    "another important observation is that a given progression of structures ( for differing values of the radial trapping strength and increasing values of @xmath22 ) displays similar structures to those found at smaller trapping strengths , for higher values of the rotating wall strength .",
    "this fact will be important to arrive at structures that show the maximum uniformity and also exhibit a stable equilibrium .",
    "note that in these calculations , we fix the wall potential and then vary @xmath124 . in doing so",
    ", we find that we are limited by how many ions we can hold in stable equilibrium . because the radial deconfinement decreases as the rotational frequency @xmath124 decreases , the effect of the rotating wall will become stronger if it also remains fixed .",
    "we have done this here to reduce the parameter space we explore .",
    "but , if one wants to examine larger crystals , then one needs to carefully tune the rotating wall strength as the rotational frequency is changed , as well as the strength of the quartic potential , to be able to continue to maintain stable equilibrium .",

    "this is an important observation , as the increasingly uniform nearest - neighbor distances for the triangular wall crystal would imply a more uniform spin - spin coupling strength only for detuning strength values that are moderately large . for intermediate values of @xmath162 , it is important to consider the nature of modes just below the center - of - mass mode to describe the spin - spin coupling strength between ions corresponding to that strength of detuning .",
    "in this work , we have examined the properties of a penning trap with an additional anharmonic and triangular rotating wall potential which provide a much more uniform ionic crystal for use in quantum simulation . by performing a detailed analysis of the equilibrium positions , the phonons , and the effective spin - spin interactions , we find that indeed one can generally obtain more uniform spin - spin coupling constants .",
    "as one might have predicted , the relationship between ionic spacing in the lattice and the uniformity of the spin - spin interactions is not directly one - to - one . for small @xmath161 values , it is the character of the phonon eigenmodes that lie close to the center - of - mass mode that determine the behavior of the spin - spin couplings more than the interparticle spacing .",
