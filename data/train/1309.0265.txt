    "measles , rubella , and hepatitis a and b are also biologically and technically feasible candidates for eradication @xcite . despite strong biological , technical and cost - benefit arguments for infectious - disease eradication , securing societal and political commitments is a substantial challenge @xcite .    with communities more connected than ever ,",
    "the control or eradication of an infectious disease requires coordinated efforts at many levels , from cities to nations . for vaccine - preventable diseases , public health authorities plan immunisation strategies across varying regions with limited resources . the world health organization ( who ) has helped to organise global immunisation efforts , leading to significant global reduction in polio and measles cases @xcite .",
    "one vaccination strategy that has been utilised in the global fight against polio and measles is mass immunisation , which may be regarded as a pulse vaccination @xcite .",
    "the complex logistics required for these mass - immunisation campaigns magnifies the need for research into the effectiveness and optimal deployment of pulse vaccination @xcite .",
    "pulse vaccination has been investigated in several mathematical models , often in disease models with seasonal transmission .",
    "many diseases show seasonal patterns in circulation ; thus inclusion of seasonality may be crucial .",
    "agur et al .",
    "( 1993 ) argued for pulse vaccination using a model of seasonal measles transmission , conjecturing that the pulses may antagonise the periodic disease dynamics and achieve control at a reduced cost of vaccination @xcite .",
    "shulgin et al . (",
    "1998 ) investigated the local stability of the disease - free periodic solution in a seasonally forced population model with three groups : susceptible ( s ) , infected ( i ) and recovered ( r ) .",
    "they considered pulse vaccination and explicitly found the threshold pulsing period @xcite .",
    "recently , onyango and mller considered optimal periodic vaccination strategies in the seasonally forced sir model and found that a well - timed pulse is optimal , but its effectiveness is often close to that of constant - rate vaccination @xcite .",
    "in addition to seasonality , spatial structure has been recognised as an important factor for disease dynamics and control @xcite .",
    "heterogeneity in the population movement , along with the patchy distribution of populations , suggests the use of metapopulation models describing disease transmission in patches or spatially structured populations or regions .",
    "mobility can be incorporated and tracked in these models in various forms .",
    "common models include linear constant fluxes representing long - term population motion ( e.g. migration @xcite ) and nonlinear mass - action representing short - term mobility @xcite .",
    "liu et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and burton et al .",
    "( 2012 ) considered epidemic models with both types of movement @xcite . a possible inherent advantage of pulse vaccination in a spatially structured setting , discussed by earn et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , is that the disease dynamics in coupled regions can become synchronised by pulse vaccination , thereby increasing the probability of global disease eradication @xcite .",
    "earn et al .",
    "presented simulations of patch synchronisation after simultaneous pulse vaccinations in a seasonal seir metapopulation model in which the patch population dynamics were initially out of phase . here an additional population class of exposed ( e ) was considered .",
    "coordinating simultaneous pulse vaccination campaigns in connected regions may be vital for successful employment of pulse - vaccination strategies .",
    "indeed , employing synchronised pulse vaccinations across large areas in the form of national immunisation days ( nids ) and , on an international scale , with simultaneous nids , has been successful in fighting polio @xcite .",
    "an example of large - scale coordination among nations is operation mecacar ( the coordinated poliomyelitis eradication efforts in mediterranean , caucasus and central asian republics ) , which were initiated in 1995 .",
    "the project was viewed as a success and an illustration of international coordination in disease control @xcite . however ,",
    "public health , including the control of infectious diseases and epidemics , has usually been managed on a national or regional scale , despite the potential impact of population movement @xcite .",
    "recently , pulse vaccination has been analysed in epidemic metapopulation models @xcite . terry ( 2010 )",
    "@xcite presented a sufficient condition for eradication in an sir patch model with periodic pulse vaccinations independently administered in each patch with linear migration rates , but left open the problem of finding a threshold quantity for eradication and evaluating the effect of pulse synchronisation and seasonality .",
    "yang and xiao ( 2010 ) @xcite conducted a global analysis of an sir patch model with synchronous periodic pulse vaccinations and linear migration rates ; however , they did not allow for the different patches to administer the pulses at distinct times and seasons .    a major poliovirus transmission route in africa and the middle east is fecal - to - oral transmission . in this indirect route , often facilitated by inadequate water management",
    ", water plays an analogous role to that of a reservoir , although such an environmental reservoir does not allow the pathogen to reproduce .",
    "nevertheless , its effect on the pathogen dispersal can dramatically modify epidemic patterns @xcite .",
    "the competition between the direct and indirect transmission routes was examined in the case of highly pathogenic avian influenza h5n1 @xcite , showing that indirect fecal - to - oral transmission could lead to a higher death toll than that associated with direct contact transmission .    in this article",
    ", we consider an sir metapopulation model with both short- and long - term mobility , direct and indirect ( environmental ) transmission , seasonality and independent periodic pulse vaccination in each patch .",
    "the primary objectives are to find the effective reproduction number , @xmath0 , prove that it provides a sharp eradication threshold and assess the optimal timing of pulse vaccinations in the sense of minimising @xmath0 .",
    "our mathematical model and analysis allow us to evaluate how pulse synchronisation across connected patches affects the efficacy of the overall pulse - vaccination strategy .",
    "we also determine how different movement scenarios affect the optimal deployment of vaccinations across the patches , along with considering how environmental transmission affects results .",
    "finally , we discuss how pulse vaccination and constant - rate vaccination strategies compare when considering the goal of poliomyelitis global eradication .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec2 ] ,",
    "we describe and give motivation for the mathematical model . in section [ sec3 ] ,",
    "we analyse the disease - free system , which is necessary to characterise the dynamics of the model . in section [ sec4 ] , @xmath0 is defined . in section [ sec5 ]",
    ", we prove that if @xmath1 , the disease dies out , and if @xmath2 , then it is uniformly persistent . in section [ sec6 ]",
    ", we consider a two - patch example , which provides insight into the optimal timing of pulse vaccinations , the effect of mobility and environmental transmission parameters on @xmath0 , and a comparison of pulse vaccination to constant - rate vaccination in this setting . in this section",
    ", we also prove that pulse synchronization is optimal for a special case of the model and provide numerical simulations to illustrate this result in more general settings .",
    "finally , in section [ sec7 ] , we provide a discussion of the implications of our results and future work to consider .",
    "we consider a variant of an sir metapopulation model with @xmath3 patches , each with populations of susceptible , infected and recovered denoted by @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 for each patch @xmath7 .",

    "infected individuals from patch @xmath8 are assumed to travel to patch @xmath9 , infect some susceptibles in patch @xmath9 and then return to patch @xmath8 on a shorter timescale than that of the disease dynamics .",
    "conversely , susceptibles from patch @xmath9 can travel to patch @xmath8 , become infected and return to patch @xmath9 on the shorter timescale .    in the model for poliomyelitis",
    "presented herein , both direct contact and indirect environmental routes are considered .",
    "the environmental contamination of the virus in each patch @xmath8 is described by a state variable , denoted by @xmath18 . infected individuals in patch @xmath8 ( @xmath5 )",
    "shed the virus into the environmental reservoir @xmath18 at the rate @xmath19 .",
    "the virus in the environmental reservoir can not reproduce outside of the host and decays at the rate @xmath20 .",
    "the virus in the environmental reservoir @xmath8 , @xmath18 , contributes to the infected population in patch @xmath21 through the mass - action term @xmath22 .",
    "direct transmission contributing to @xmath21 is represented by the mass - action term @xmath23 . due to possible seasonality of poliovirus circulation @xcite ,",
    "both direct and environmental transmission parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are assumed to be periodic with a period of one year .",

    "moreover , the non - negative quadrant @xmath44 is invariant and there exists @xmath50 such that @xmath51 for all @xmath52 .",
    "the existence , uniqueness , and regularity for non - impulse times come from results that can be found in @xcite . in order to show the invariance of @xmath44 , consider the set @xmath53 . on this set , @xmath54",

    "specifically , we rewrite @xmath0 for a general periodic vaccination strategy @xmath466 in a form that compares it to the constant - vaccination strategy of equal cost . first , as noted in @xcite , by integrating the @xmath476 equation over one period , the following can be obtained : @xmath477    define the average transmission rate as @xmath478 . for constant vaccination , @xmath479 , so we find that @xmath480 and the effective reproduction number is @xmath481 .",
    "for the periodic vaccination rate @xmath466 , we rewrite the effective reproduction number @xmath0 by comparing it to a constant - vaccination strategy of equal cost : @xmath482    if we normalise @xmath473 by letting @xmath483 and denote @xmath484 ( the reproduction number in the absence of vaccination ) , then the following is obtained : @xmath485    clearly , if @xmath467 is constant  i.e. , @xmath486  then all vaccination strategies are equivalent , in particular pulse- and constant - vaccination strategies , and @xmath487 .",
    "this observation provides justification as to why @xmath488 is an appropriate cost measure from an epidemiological point of view .",
    "when @xmath467 is not constant , then a different result is obtained .",
    "define @xmath489 and notice that @xmath490 .",
    "then @xmath491 acts as a weighting function and can be chosen to maximise @xmath492 , thereby minimising @xmath0 . intuitively , a susceptible profile @xmath491 that is minimal for the range of values where @xmath493 and maximal for @xmath494 would seem to work the best .",
    "the rigorous construction of the optimal vaccination strategy was carried out by onyango and mller @xcite .",
    "they found that a single , well - timed pulse is the optimal strategy ( assuming that the allotted cost can be exhausted by a single pulse ; otherwise , the optimal susceptible profile requires @xmath495 on @xmath496\\subset [ 0 , \\tau)$ ] and no vaccinations can occur in @xmath497 $ ] ) @xcite .",
    "for the pulse - vaccination strategy @xmath470 , we find that @xmath498 it can be inferred that the advantage of the optimal pulse vaccination over constant vaccination ( in terms of difference in @xmath0 ) increases with @xmath407 , @xmath408 ( when @xmath407 remains fixed ) , @xmath409 and the amplitude of @xmath499 .",
    "a natural question to ask is whether similar results can be obtained for the two - patch model .",
    "first , for the case of no seasonality , does the equivalence of vaccination strategies hold ?",
    "the cost can still be defined as number of vaccinations per period in each patch calculated at the disease - free periodic solution .",
    "the vaccination rate @xmath500 has two components . consider the diagonal matrix @xmath501 and the @xmath502 disease - free periodic solution vector @xmath473 .",
    "then @xmath503 ; here @xmath488 is a @xmath502 vector containing the cost in each patch .",
    "the effective reproduction number , @xmath0 , is defined in section [ sec4 ] , but can not be explicitly expressed for multiple patches . using notation from section [ sec4 ] , we note that the reproduction number , @xmath0 , for constant vaccination in the case of no seasonality ( i.e. , @xmath504 are independent of time ) is found to be @xmath505 , which agrees with the next - generation matrices for autonomous disease - compartmental models @xcite .    under the conditions of theorem [ r0theorem ]",
    " no cross - transmission and no migration of infected  the equivalence of vaccination strategies of equal cost holds for constant transmission rate by ( [ r0diag ] ) .",
    "numerical simulations showed that shifting the phase difference between the pulse vaccinations can alter the value of @xmath0 when there is cross transmission and no migration ( figure [ fig : cross ] ) , even though the cost @xmath488 remains constant .",
    "thus the equivalence of vaccination strategies of equal cost can not hold for the general constant transmission case in system ( [ 2patch ] ) . however , we performed simulations with many different parameters showing that the synchronised pulse vaccinations have values of @xmath0 very close ( within the range of numerical error ) or identical to the reproduction number for the constant - vaccination strategy of equal cost . for the case of no cross transmission ( but migration of _ both _ susceptible and infected ) , simulations produced identical or nearly identical reproduction numbers for constant and pulse vaccinations of equal cost , independent of the phase difference @xmath344 .",
    "this is not in contradiction with figure [ fig : mig ] , since shifting the phase difference @xmath344 in the migration model alters the cost of vaccination ; i.e. , synchronised pulses result in more vaccinations per period than desynchronised pulses in model ( [ 2patch ] ) when @xmath506 .",
    "one implication of the cases where pulse vaccination and constant vaccination of equal cost agree on the value of @xmath0 is that results obtained in prior work on the autonomous multi - patch model can carry over to the impulsive model .",
    "for example , an imbalance in migration rates has been shown to strongly affect @xmath0 in previous work on metapopulation models @xcite . the same result is found in the case of pulse vaccination , as shown in figure [ fig : optdeploy ] . for otherwise identical patches , an imbalance in migration rates @xmath507 causes the susceptibles and infected to concentrate more heavily in one patch , which increases the overall effective reproduction number .",
    "this affects how the vaccine should be optimally distributed among the two patches , as illustrated in figure [ fig : optdeploy ] .    as in the single - patch model , including seasonality induces an advantage of well - timed pulse vaccination over constant vaccination of equal cost . in figure",
    "[ fig : compare ] , we see that , as the amplitude of seasonality increases , synchronous pulse vaccinations applied the season before the high - transmission season can become more and more advantageous . simulations also show that the migration rate does not affect @xmath0 for the case of identical patches and simultaneous pulses .",
    "the advantage of pulse vaccination over constant vaccination depends on the parameters , as detailed previously . for the simulations in figure [ fig : compare ] ,",
    "pulse vaccination can offer a substantive advantage over constant vaccination .",
    "hence the inherent advantage of pulse vaccination in a seasonal model may provide motivation for its employment over constant vaccination , contrary to what is stated by onyango and mller @xcite .",
    "finally , we consider how environmental transmission affects the results . to begin this section ,",
    "we state a general theorem about the effective reproduction number for the autonomous ( unpulsed ) version of the general model ( [ mod ] ) with environmental transmission .",
    "the following theorem states that the effective reproduction number for the autonomous version of the general model ( [ mod ] ) with environmental transmission is identical to the effective reproduction number of the autonomous model ( [ mod ] ) without environmental transmission , but with the redefined direct transmission parameter @xmath508 .",
    "[ envr0 ] denote @xmath509 as the effective reproduction number of the autonomous version ( [ mod ] ) .",
    "let @xmath508 and @xmath510 denote the effective reproduction number of the autonomous version of the multi - patch sir sub - model ( no environmental transmission ) in ( [ mod ] ) with the direct transmission parameter as @xmath511",
    ". then @xmath512 .    to find the reproduction number , @xmath509 , for the autonomous version of ( [ mod ] )",
    ", we utilize the standard next - generation approach @xcite .",
    "then the infection component linearization at the disease - free equilibrium is @xmath513 , where the @xmath325 matrices @xmath267 and @xmath514 can be written in the block - triangular form : @xmath515 in which @xmath516 are @xmath240 matrices . here",
    "@xmath324 and @xmath97 are diagonal matrices with @xmath517 and @xmath518 ( @xmath519 ) as the respective diagonal entries .",
    "the entries of matrices @xmath520 , @xmath521 and @xmath104 are as follows : @xmath522 and @xmath523 , where @xmath524 is the kronecker delta function and @xmath525 is the disease - free equilibrium . then @xmath526 @xmath509 is the spectral radius of @xmath505 , so @xmath527",
    ". now define @xmath508 and consider the effective reproduction number , @xmath510 , of the autonomous version of ( [ mod ] ) with no environmental transmission , but with direct transmission rate @xmath511 .",
    "it is not hard to see that @xmath528 .",
    "thus @xmath512 , and the result is obtained .",
    "thus , for the autonomous case , the addition of environmental transmission to an sir metapopulation model , by considering the system ( [ mod ] ) , does not qualitatively affect the effective reproduction number .",
    "we should note that environmental transmission can result in a substantive delay in epidemic onset and its duration of first peak when compared to the analogous regime of direct transmission @xcite , so the nature of the transient dynamics is affected by environmental transmission .    for simulations ,",
    "we include the environmental parameters in the two - patch model ( [ 2patch ] ) and suppose the the patches are identical .",
    "then , using the notation from the previous identical patch case , we can write the infected - component equations as : @xmath529 where @xmath530 is the total transmission rate , @xmath531 , @xmath532 , @xmath533 is the fraction of environmental transmission , @xmath534 and @xmath535 is fraction of cross - transmission for direct and environmental transmission , respectively .",
    "then , by theorem [ envr0 ] , the effective reproduction number for the autonomous model with constant per capita vaccination rate of susceptibles , @xmath461 , is @xmath536 clearly , adding environmental transmission to the identical two - patch model ( [ 2patch ] ) does not alter the autonomous ( without pulse vaccination ) patch reproduction number @xmath509 if we re - define the transmission rate in ( [ r0hat ] ) to be @xmath537 .",
    "however , when pulse vaccination is introduced into the model , we find that the fraction of environmental transmission , @xmath538 , affects @xmath0 . in figure",
    "[ fig : enva ] , synchronous pulse vaccinations are compared to constant vaccination as @xmath538 is varied .",
    "the reproduction number , @xmath0 , under the pulse vaccination shows non - monotone behaviour with respect to @xmath538 , with a maximum occurring around @xmath539 and the minimum occurring at @xmath540 ( where all of the transmission is due to the environment ) .",
    "we remark that this graph looks the same for many different values that we utilised for the migration rate and cross transmission , in particular for the case of isolated patches .",
    "the other parameters are as in table [ table ] with @xmath541 days@xmath542 and @xmath543 .",
    "note that the parameter values for @xmath544 and @xmath203 are absorbed into @xmath538 through a rescaling .",
    "of course , we know from before that when @xmath545 , the vaccination strategies yield identical @xmath0 ( proven in the isolated patch case without seasonality ) .",
    "in contrast , even in the single patch case , environmental transmission can cause disagreement in the reproduction numbers for pulse- and constant - vaccination strategies of equal cost .",
    "this result can be viewed as an impulsive analogue to that showing that sinusoidal transmission alters the reproduction number for an seir model , but leaves the reproduction number for the sir model the same as with constant transmission @xcite .",
    "indeed , an seir model can be seen as a special case of the no - impulse environmental transmission model . in figure",
    "[ fig : envb ] , we vary the phase difference , @xmath344 , between the vaccination pulses for three different values of @xmath538 ( 0 , 0.2 and 1 ) , when @xmath546 .",
    "the remaining parameters are as in table [ table ] .",
    "we have studied pulse vaccination in metapopulations , using poliovirus vaccination as our focus . by allowing each patch to have distinct , periodic pulse - vaccination schedules connected with a common period  along with considering seasonality , environmental transmission and two types of mobility  we add more generality and complexity to prior models .",
    "the effective reproduction number , @xmath0 , is defined for the model , system ( [ mod ] ) , and found to be a global threshold .",
    "if @xmath1 , then the disease dies out ; on the other hand , when @xmath2 , the disease uniformly persists .    through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations , we were able to gain insights into optimising vaccination strategies in the metapopulation setting .",
    "theorem [ r0theorem ] and the supporting numerical simulations show that synchronising vaccination pulses among connected patches is key in minimising the effective reproduction number .",
    "an open problem is to analytically prove that synchronising the pulses minimises @xmath0 under more general conditions than are assumed in theorem [ r0theorem ] .",
    "evidence from the epidemiological data suggests that pulse synchronisation at different spatial scales influences the effectiveness of a vaccination campaign .",
    "based on field studies , the who recommends that the duration of the vaccination campaign , in the form of national immunisation days , be as short as possible ( 12 days ) @xcite .",
    "the importance of administering the vaccine across a whole country in 12 days , as opposed to taking a longer period of time , may be in part due to the higher levels of synchronisation for the shorter duration vaccination campaign .",
    "increased seroconversion rates also seem to play a role in the optimality of mass vaccinations with short duration @xcite . on an international scale , the effectiveness of operation mecacar @xcite and a study of the effect of migration on measles incidence after mass vaccination in burkina faso @xcite point to the importance of pulse synchronisation .",
    "our study highlights the critical role that the who and national governments can play in optimising disease control by synchronising mass vaccination campaigns among countries and regions .    another important problem is comparing the effectiveness of periodic mass ( pulse ) vaccination versus routine ( constant ) vaccination .",
    "disease - control authorities must consider certain logistical aspects , which may affect the cost of implementing a particular strategy . from a mathematical perspective , the fundamental starting point for comparison is to consider @xmath0 for strategies of equal vaccinations per period .",
    "for the case of no seasonality and environmental transmission , we find some cases where the strategies are equivalent in terms of @xmath0 .",
    "when seasonality is included , a well - timed pulse - vaccination strategy ( simultaneous pulses administered during the season before the high - transmission season ) is optimal ( assuming the patches have synchronous seasons ) , similar to results for the single - patch sir model @xcite .",
    "future work will consider comparing pulse vaccination and constant - vaccination strategies in a stochastic model , which yields some insights not seen in the deterministic setting .",
    "more work needs to be done in the case of environmental transmission . when indirect transmission was considered to be a major mode of transmission in other studies , a delay in epidemic onset and its extension when compared to the analogous regime of direct transmission",
    "were observed @xcite .",
    "this could be explained by the persistence of the virus in the environment leading to new infections generated over a longer duration than that of the direct contact .",
    "such a two - step mechanism , with a human - to - environment segment and an environment - to - human segment , could lead to delay and extension of the effective infectious period when compared to that of direct human - to - human transmission @xcite .",
    "interestingly , we found that varying the fraction of environmental transmission in the system alters the effective reproduction number @xmath0 under pulse vaccination , contrary to results for the case of constant - rate vaccination .",
    "further consideration of the interaction of environment - induced delay with the influence of seasonality on environmental transmission and pulse vaccination is the subject of our ongoing work .    finally , we mention the importance of incorporating mobility and spatial structure into disease models .",
    "in addition to our findings about the how mobility induces an advantage to synchronise pulse vaccination , population movement has other implications for disease control .",
    "as found in previous work on autonomous models @xcite , imbalance in migration rates among the patches can have a large effect on the overall reproduction number , which may alter the optimal vaccine distribution among patches or may influence disease - control strategies related to movement restriction .",
    "the combination of population movement with complexities of control strategies and disease transmission presents many problems for which mathematical modelling may yield valuable insight .",
