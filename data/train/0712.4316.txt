    "antiferromagnets subjected to an external magnetic field have attracted considerable attention over the years , largely owing to interesting features which they share with a rather broad class of quantum many - body systems situated on a lattice .",
    "the series of quantum phase transitions encountered as the field strength is varied may be viewed as a spin - analogue of the superfluid - mott insulator transitions observed in boson hubbard models@xcite , which model e.g. josephson junction arrays@xcite and optical lattices@xcite .",
    "magnetization plateaus emerging at simple fractions of the saturated magnetization are reminiscent of the quantum hall effects@xcite .",
    "recent developments reveal the subject to be interconnected with an even richer variety of issues such as the luttinger theorem@xcite , electric polarization in solids@xcite , and fractionalization of quantum numbers in dimensions greater than one@xcite .    in this article",
    "we revisit this problem from yet another perspective , i.e. that of geometric phases@xcite .",
    "the basis of our arguments rests only on rather general properties of berry connections , topological terms and boson - vortex duality , much of which are valid in any dimension .",
    "we aim to shed new light on the above body of interrelated phenomena , with particular emphasis on providing a workable format with which to pursue further exotica in quantum spin liquids , anticipated to emerge along this line of study .",
    "in view of the fairly technical nature of the presentation to follow , we wish to highlight in this section its main contents , placing them in context with previous work .",
    "section [ sec : lsm ] is devoted to a geometrical reinterpretation of the well - known @xmath1=1 result of oshikawa , yamanaka and affleck ( oya)@xcite , which yields a quantum - mechanical constraint on the possible values which the magnetization can assume at plateaus , i.e. in a spin - gapped regime .",
    "( in this article the notation @xmath1 is reserved to denote the spatial dimensionality . )",
    "the oya work ( reviewed in subsection [ subsec : lsm ] ) builds on arguments initiated by lieb , schulz and mattis@xcite ( lsm ) , wherein the central step consists of comparing the crystal momenta of the ground state and a candidate low - lying excited state , constructed from the ground state by applying a slow twist to the spins .",
    "( the resulting quantization rule agrees with that obtained by bosonization methods @xcite . )",
    "meanwhile there is a simple geometric formulation of the crystal momentum of a _ ferromagnetic _",
    "spin chain due to haldane@xcite , which incorporates the language of spin berry phases .",
    "we show that this framework can be adapted to our problem involving antiferromagnets , provided the spin moments are partially polarized due to the magnetic field .",
    "carrying out the lsm procedure in this geometric language then simply amounts to evaluating the difference between berry phases associated with untwisted and twisted spin configurations .",
    "we find that this indeed leads immediately to the celebrated oya rule .    in section [ sec : dual - vortex ]",
    "we show that a similar geometric structure underlies the magnetization properties of antiferromagnets in _ arbitrary _ spatial dimensions . here",
    "there are no obvious substitutes for the lsm scheme or the bosonization technique ( both of which are by design specific to @xmath1=1 ) , and the generalization of the oya result to spatial dimensions larger than unity@xcite is known to be a subtle problem .",
    "our strategy is to build instead on the semiclassical picture of the previous subsection and to derive a low - energy effective theory for partially polarized antiferromagnets . with the magnitude of the spin polarization essentially fixed by the magnetic field",
    ", the long wavelength physics mainly involves the orientational fluctuation of the residual _ planar _ staggered moment , lying in the plane perpendicular to the field .",
    "symmetry thus dictates that our effective action should be a variant of the quantum xy model .",
    "a careful derivation confirms this expectation ; we find however that the imaginary - time action for this xy model also contains a purely imaginary topological term ( proportional to the time - derivative of the phase variable ) whose coefficient is given by @xmath2 , with @xmath3 the spin quantum number and @xmath4 the magnetization per site .",
    "this perhaps is not surprising if one recalls that a complex - valued low energy action also arises out of the closely - related boson - hubbard model away from commensurate filling factors@xcite .",
    "the later half of section [ sec : dual - vortex ] thus explores the consequence of complexifying our action by the addition of such a term to the effective xy model .",
    "we know from earlier work on the hydrodynamical properties of superfluids and superconductors ( where actions of the same form appear ) that the topological term crucially influences the quantum dynamics of _ phase vortices _ by subjecting them to a magnus - type force @xcite . at the heart of this phenomenon",
    "is an aharonov - bohm ( ab)-like quantum phase interference which renders each vortex to act like a charged particle immersed in a fictitious magnetic field whose strength is fixed by the topological term .",
    "( the magnus force is then simply understood to be a pseudo - lorentz force . ) since vortex events ( point vortices in ( 1 + 1)d , vortex loops in ( 2 + 1)d , and vortex sheets in ( 3 + 1)d ) are the most relevant disordering agents of an xy model , it is clearly important to see how such an interference effect manifests itself in the present problem . for this purpose",
    "we incorporate simple duality techniques which enables us to visualize the physics directly in the language of vortices .",
    "( as later explained , the approaches taken here as well as in section [ sec : z2-gauge ] are intimately related to the recent work of balents et al@xcite who ( in a context slightly different from ours ) run a detailed projective symmetry group analysis to classify the possible ground states which the vortices of the xy model can assume . )",
    "we find that the pseudo - ab effect generates berry phase factors associated with the vortex events , which in turn governs ( given a specified valued of @xmath2 ) whether the condensation of these topological defects is allowed as a result of constructive interference , or alternatively , a destructive interference renders the vortex configurations irrelevant .",
    "( the former case will imply spin disordering and hence the formation of a magnetization plateau . )",
    "it is easy to recognize that the former can happen for @xmath5 , the condition under which _ all _ vortex berry phases become trivial",
    ". defects of arbitrary vorticity ( most importantly singly quantized vortices ) will then be able to condense .",
    "a more subtle situation arises when the value of @xmath2 is a rational number , in which case vortices must be _ multiply quantized _ in order to condense . with this physical picture ( which links berry phases to the magnetization behavior ) in hand ,",
    "it is also interesting to study the effect of dzyaloshinskii - moriya type perturbations which can modify the berry phase factors .",
    "a brief discussion on this issue is given at the end of this section .",
    "in section v we look into a particularly important class of problems where the quantity @xmath2 is a half - odd integer , i.e. @xmath6 . the central observation to make here is that the system can dynamically acquire a @xmath7 gauge symmetry .",
    "we thus come into contact with the work of sachdev and park@xcite who , in the course of their search for novel spin liquids in the _ absence _ of a magnetic field arrive at the same effective theory ( for easy - plane antiferromagnets ) - a lattice xy model coupled to an ising gauge theory with a @xmath8-valued berry phase term .",
    "this theory has a phase diagram which accommodates a fractionalized phase@xcite , and we discuss how this arises within our magnetization problem .",
    "interestingly , we find that this derivation generalizes to the case where @xmath2 is set at other simple rational numbers ; for instance when @xmath9 , we are lead to a similar effective theory coupled to a @xmath10 gauge field with a @xmath10-valued berry phase term . the results of this section thus illustrates the unexpectedly rich phase structure of square lattice antiferromagnets in a magnetic field , suggesting them to be a promising place to seek exotic spin liquid states .",
    "appendix [ appendix on oya ] supplements section [ sec : lsm ] while the details of the duality methods used in section [ sec : dual - vortex ] can be found in appendix [ appendix on duality ] .",
    "the lsm argument@xcite gives us an important insight into how low - lying excitations in one dimensional systems are constructed .",
    "let us consider a translationally invariant @xmath1=1 quantum system with a unique ground state @xmath11 .",
    "the key idea of lsm is that the following _ twisted _ state @xmath12 is made up of low - lying excited states ( provided that the crystal momentum satisfies a certain condition which will be fixed shortly ) , and",
    "should hence be a useful reference state for extracting information on the low energy spectrum of the system . to evaluate the momentum shift caused by @xmath13 ,",
    "it is convenient to consider the phase acquired in the process of executing a 1-site translation @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) . since @xmath16 one",
    "can readily see that @xmath13 shifts the crystal momentum @xmath17 by @xmath18 where we have introduced the magnetization ( density ) @xmath19 .",
    "the above expression implies that if @xmath20 the twisted state @xmath21 is orthogonal to the ground state @xmath11 , that is , the twisted state consists of excited states of the _ finite - size _ system .",
    "moreover , it is not difficult to show that for generic hamiltonians with short - range interactions the energy of the twisted state decreases like @xmath22 as the system size grows @xmath23 . thus we are lead to an interesting dichotomy ; if @xmath20 , the system in the thermodynamic limit either has gapless excitations over the unique ground state or has several degenerate ground states corresponding to a spontaneous breaking of ( translational ) symmetry .",
    "( the latter possibility becomes relevant when @xmath24 ( where integers @xmath25 and @xmath26 are coprime ) , as one easily sees by repeating the above twist operation @xmath26 times . )",
    "this , combined with a complimentary commensurability argument based on bosonization , yields the so - called _ quantization condition _ of magnetization plateaus@xcite : @xmath27 ( @xmath28 : period of the _ infinite - size _ ground state ) .    in a strict sense ,",
    "the above lsm argument alone tells us nothing about the presence / absence of plateaus as low - lying excitations created by the lsm twist do not change the total magnetization @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , although a similar conclusion has been reached@xcite in higher dimensions as well , it is not totally clear why the same sort of quantization condition exists regardless of dimensionality while the lsm argument is valid _ only _ in one dimension . in an attempt to clarify such issues , and to set the stage for unearthing further exotic properties",
    ", we will now reformulate the problem employing the language of berry phases . namely we will adopt a geometric approach to evaluating the crystal momenta of magnetic systems@xcite , and show that the momentum of eq.([eqn : lsm - shift ] ) , which was central to the lsm argument re - emerges as _ an additional berry phase _ which is generated upon application of the twist .",
    "an incarnation of this geometric effect will arise in the form of vortex berry phases in the low energy field theory described in section [ sec : dual - vortex ] , which can be constructed for arbitrary @xmath1 .",
    "we begin by quickly recalling how a spin berry phase typically arises .",
    "consider a spin-@xmath3 object represented by a spin coherent state@xcite @xmath30 , where the unit vector @xmath31 specifies ( in a semiclassical sense ) the spin s orientation .",
    "when the dynamics of the system is such that @xmath31 undergoes an adiabatic rotation , returning to its initial value at the end of the excursion , the wavefunction accumulates a net phase of @xmath32 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath33 is a berry connection defined by @xmath34 $ ] , @xmath35 is the loop on the unit sphere mapped out by the trajectory @xmath36 , and @xmath37 $ ] the solid angle enclosed by @xmath35 .",
    "one can conceive of situations where a similar phase accumulation is induced along a _",
    "( as opposed to temporal ) extent of a many - spin system by a gradual spatial change of @xmath38 .",
    "such an example was elaborated by haldane@xcite in his study of the crystal momenta of a ferromagnetic spin chain .",
    "here one is concerned with an instantaneous spin configuration written as a direct product of spin coherent states , @xmath39 as in the previous subsection , information on the crystal momentum @xmath17 is gained by inspecting how the generator of translation @xmath40 ( @xmath41 : lattice constant ) affects this configuration .",
    "however , we should keep in mind that the state ( [ eqn : coherent - state ] ) is in general not an eigenstate of @xmath14 , and we will in this semiclassical approach be evaluating the expectation value @xmath42 instead of the eigenvalue itself@xcite . since by definition @xmath43",
    ", ( we assume a periodic boundary condition ( pbc ) , where the @xmath44th site is identified with site 1 ) we find , in analogy to the familiar temporal berry phase , that in the continuum limit @xmath45}. \\label{haldane 's formula}\\ ] ] the solid angle @xmath46 $ ] is now associated with the loop traced out by the snapshot configuration @xmath47 . eq.([haldane s formula ] ) suggests that the crystal momenta of a @xmath1=1 ferromagnet is a topological quantity which is best described as a quantal phase defined modulo 2@xmath48 .    as illustrated in the previous subsection , evaluating the crystal momenta carried by the low - energy states is the central step in a lsm - type scheme@xcite .",
    "it is therefore tempting to derive the counterpart to eq.([haldane s formula ] ) for our present problem , since by introducing such a relation into the lsm program , we can expect to arrive at a geometrical picture underlying the magnetization properties of antiferromagnets .",
    "we show below that this is indeed possible . in doing so however , the follow points require clarification .",
    "( 1 ) the ground state of a quantum antiferromagnet is generally complicated , and can not be expressed in the form of a spin coherent state as in eq.([eqn : coherent - state ] ) .",
    "however , one can show @xcite that if we take the large-@xmath3 limit , the quantum ground state will generally approach a conventional collinear nel state .",
    "this is the basis of our use of a coherent state ansatz in the following semiclassical treatment .",
    "( we will explore in appendix [ appendix on oya ] what will happen when we relax this ansatz ; see the remark of the end of this section . )",
    "( 2 ) it is also pertinent to observe that eq.([haldane s formula ] ) is sensible only when the spin orientation @xmath49 is of a smoothly varying nature .",
    "meanwhile antiferromagnets in an external field would generally have components which vary on the lattice scale .",
    "for the berry phase framework to work , therefore , we must devise a way to represent our system in terms of a coherent state labeled by some slowly - varying field .",
    "let us start then from a canted configuration @xmath50 where the unit vectors @xmath51 represent the orientation of spins partially polarized by a magnetic field applied along the z - axis(see fig .",
    "[ angles figure ] ) .",
    "we can identify the unit vector @xmath52 as a slowly - varying ( unstaggered ) vector field for which the corresponding berry connection @xmath53 is a valid construction .    , and the magnetization per site @xmath4 .",
    "]    this motivates us to introduce the unitary operator @xmath54 $ ] which transforms @xmath55 into @xmath56 , i.e. @xmath57 . noting that @xmath58 { \\hat u}$ ] ( with pbc and @xmath59=even assumed ) , we find that @xmath60 where the last line is a large-@xmath3 result and is a consequence of the minimal uncertainty property of the spin coherent state@xcite",
    ". we may now incorporate haldane s formula , eq.([haldane s formula ] ) to obtain @xmath61}. \\label{main formula}\\ ] ] thus we have separated out the intrinsic part , where the berry phase appears , from a momentum offset arising from the staggered nature of the ground state .",
    "( we pause to observe that in the _ absence _ of the magnetic field , a similar attempt to extract a berry phase associated with smoothly varying components would run into difficulties , since that would involve , instead of a simple unitary transformation the simultaneous flipping of all three components of spins residing on every other site , i.e. time reversal operations . )",
    "the existence of this magnetization - dependent offset is also easily seen from the exact bethe - ansatz solution@xcite of the @xmath62 xxz chain .",
    "the next task is to compare eq.([main formula ] ) with the corresponding expectation value for a lsm - twisted state .",
    "the latter state is defined by @xmath63 , where @xmath64 .",
    "we note that @xmath65=0 $ ] .",

    "notice that the twist leaves the offset portion of the momentum unaffected .",
    "the right hand side expressions of eqs.([main formula ] ) and ( [ twisted formula ] ) will coincide if @xmath71=s\\omega[{\\bf n}(x)]+2\\pi n$ ] , where @xmath72 .",
    "following the usual logic of lsm - type arguments we may interpret this as the semiclassical expression of the necessary condition for the occurrence of a spin gap , i.e. a magnetization plateau .",

    "this is the berry - phase derivation of the lsm momentum shift ( [ eqn : lsm - shift ] ) .",
    "the aforementioned condition thus translates into the quantization rule @xmath75 .",
    "this argument is readily extended to the case where the unit cell consists of @xmath76 sites ; the relevant quantity then will be the expectation value of @xmath77 , leading to the spin - gap condition @xmath78=rs\\omega[{\\bf n}^{\\rm lsm}(x)]+2\\pi n ,   n\\in\\mathbb{z}$ ] , which in turn yields the oya quantization rule@xcite @xmath79 .",
    "finally a word on gauge independence is in order , as eq.([solid angle ] ) involves a particular gauge choice for the monopole vector potential @xmath80 ( the dirac string goes through the south pole ) .",
    "one finds that relocating the string to the north pole merely shifts the crystal momentum by @xmath81 , which is immaterial .",
    "likewise , other gauge choices consistent with the spherical geometry of the target manifold will leave the results unaltered .",
    "as noted above , we have assumed on semiclassical grounds that it suffices to deal with ground states ( and their twisted counterparts ) which can be expressed as a spin coherent state .",
    "one may wonder though whether we can extend the present argument to more generic ground states which are _ superpositions _ of coherent states .",
    "we show that this is indeed possible in appendix [ appendix on oya ] .",
    "the findings of the previous section tell us that for @xmath82 , a simple semiclassical picture involving partially polarized spin moments is capable of accounting for the results of oya , once we realize that certain quantum interference effects are at work .",
    "the latter are naturally described in terms of berry phase concepts .",
    "this prompts us to seek a generalization of such geometric interpretations to arbitrary @xmath1 .",
    "since the lsm approach is now unavailable , we will shift gears and carefully work out an effective low energy theory valid in arbitrary @xmath1 , invoking once more the semiclassical picture of canted spins .",
    "we will find that berry phase effects are again present , now manifesting themselves in the form of quantum interference among vortex configurations .",
    "these interferences can drastically alter the low energy properties of the system .",
    "( we will come full circle by later specializing to @xmath82 , and identifying a common root that this effect shares with the lsm - type argument presented in section [ sec : lsm ] . )",
    "we also discuss possible ways to perturb the system so that the berry phases ( and hence the magnetization properties ) are modified .",
    "we now substantiate the foresaid by deriving a low energy effective action for an antiferromagnet coupled to an external magnetic field . the effective theory , summarized in eq.([quantum - xy - action ] ) below , is valid irrespective of the dimensionality .    for the sake of concreteness",
    ", we will consider the following hamiltonian : @xmath83 on a @xmath1-dimensional hypercubic lattice .",
    "the first term corresponds to the usual heisenberg hamiltonian and the second to the single - ion anisotropy .",
    "the external field @xmath84 is applied in the @xmath85-direction .",
    "if we regard the phase of @xmath86 and the local magnetization @xmath87 respectively as the josephson angle @xmath88 and the boson density @xmath89 , it is easy to see the similarity to the josephson junction array : @xmath90 or , in more general terms , the boson hubbard ( bh ) model . in the large-@xmath3 limit of the model ( [ eqn : large - d - ham ] ) , spins assume a canted ( or , conical ) configuration with the xy components aligned in an anti - parallel ( antiferromagnetic ) manner : @xmath91 where @xmath92 .",
    "when either the field @xmath84 or the single - ion anisotropy @xmath93 is finite , a gap opens at @xmath94 and the only gapless mode ( a transverse spin wave ) appears at @xmath95 .    below we extract a low - energy effective theory from the model of eq.([eqn : large - d - ham ] ) , incorporating standard path - integral procedures@xcite .",
    "we illustrate this for the one - dimensional case .",

    "although the first term of @xmath110 is a total derivative , it can not be dropped from the effective action for a reason which will become clear below .",
    "following this intermediate step , we integrate out the @xmath105-field to obtain the effective action for the angular field @xmath106 : @xmath111    where the spin stiffness @xmath112 and the spinwave velocity @xmath113 are given by @xmath114 additional interactions will merely renormalize the values of @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "note that the @xmath106-field appearing in ( [ eqn : effective - action ] ) is defined on a universal covering space of a circle and the last term counts the winding number of the space - time history . in section [ sec : z2-gauge ]",

    "the former situation , in which a superfluid - to - insulator transition is generically possible , is therefore reminiscent of the @xmath75 case of the antiferromagnets .",
    "the reason behind this similarity can be traced to the behavior of the topological term present in the low energy action ; namely , both systems correspond to cases where this term ceases to be effective .",

    "hence the quantum phase transition which takes place along the integer-@xmath59 contour at this point is in the universality of the @xmath122 dimensional xy model , which is the same universality class relevant to the antiferromagnets with @xmath75 .",

    "this addition will obviously effect the vortex berry phases .",
    "for instance , while the ( 2 + 1)d expression in eq.([vortex bp factors ] ) basically counts the number of bosons residing within the shaded region of fig.2 , we must now correct for the migration due to the flow .",
    "( physically , this will cause a change in the quantum dynamics of each vortex .",
    "besides the magnus force ( perpendicular to the velocity of the vortex ) coming from the original topological term , vortices will suffer an additional  lorentz force \" which is perpendicular to the supercurrent . )",
    "this shifts the berry phase term by @xmath180 where @xmath181 and @xmath182 are each the area of the projected image of @xmath183 onto the @xmath184- and @xmath185 planes .",
    "a similar consideration leads to the following berry - phase shift in ( 1 + 1)-dimensions : @xmath186    now let us consider how the non - zero supercurrent @xmath187 ( or , non - zero dm interactions ) affects the magnetization process for the simplest ( 1 + 1)-dimensional case . in accordance with eq.([vortex - field - theory ] ) , the low - energy physics in the vicinity of @xmath188 may be described by the following sine - gordon model : @xmath189 = { \\cal s}_{\\rm kin}[\\widetilde{\\varphi } ] + y\\int d^{2}r\\cos[2\\pi ( \\delta m\\ , x + j_{x}\\tau ) + 2\\pi\\widetilde{\\varphi}]\\ ] ] where @xmath190 measures a small deviation from @xmath148 .    by a straightforward extension of the methods used in refs .",

    "in this appendix we discuss how the arguments of section [ sec : lsm ] are to be extended when one wishes to deal with a _ superposition _ of spin coherent states @xmath278 .",
    "while the case treated in the main text already captures the essential geometric properties inherent in the lsm approach , this generalization intends to fill in the gap between the treatment of the actual ground state of a heisenberg antiferromagnet ( which possesses rotational invariance ) with that given in the main text for a spin coherent state which is , in a semiclassical sense polarized in a particular orientation .",
    "let @xmath279 then be our ground state .",
    "we can generally expand this state in the ( overcomplete ) spin coherent states basis @xmath280 , where in accordance with the main text , the low energy physics is described in terms of the angular field @xmath281 specifying the in - plane orientation of the staggered spin component perpendicular to the magnetic field . @xmath282\\vert\\{\\phi(x)\\}\\rangle .",

    "we will adopt the action @xmath285 $ ] given in the text ( eq.([quantum - xy - action ] ) ) , though the arguments to follow apply to a wider variety of systems ( as long as the coefficient of the topological term remains the same ) .",
    "the hamiltonian derived from this action is @xmath286 where @xmath287 is canonically conjugate to @xmath281 .",
    "the appearance of the gauge field - like piece @xmath2 in the kinetic energy term has its origin in the topological term . in the superfluid analogy , it is simply the offset value of the superfluid density .",
    "the functional schrdinger equation reads @xmath288=e\\psi[\\phi(x)]$ ] .    as before we wish to compare the expectation values of the crystal momentum in the ground state and the lsm - twisted state .",
    "we recall that for the pure spin coherent state treated in section [ sec : lsm ] , it was for this purpose essential that the quantity @xmath289 pick a berry phase factor associated with a round trip experienced by the vector @xmath38 .",
    "it turns out however that here the corresponding expression , @xmath290\\psi[\\phi(x)]$ ] is _ not _ equipped with the anholonomy one expects to find when @xmath88 is sent on a round excursion .",
    "this can be traced to the single - valuedness of @xmath283 $ ] which implies that the wave functional be invariant under a @xmath125-shift of @xmath281 .",
    "hence as it stands one can not straightforwardly incorporate the berry phase effect , which we know from the main text to be crucial in obtaining the correct expression for the crystal momentum .",
    "the resolution comes from seeking an analogy to the quantum mechanical problem of a particle on a ring threaded by an aharonov - bohm ( ab ) flux@xcite to which our problem reduces when @xmath291 . as in the treatment of the latter , the ab - like anholonomy can encoded into the wavefunctional through a ( singular ) gauge transformation @xmath292=e^{-i\\int dx(s - m)\\phi(x)}\\psi[\\phi(x)],\\ ] ] which eliminates the ab - gauge field from the hamiltonian , i.e. @xmath293 at the price of introducing a twisted boundary condition for the transformed wavefunctional ( such that a phase change of @xmath294 is experienced as @xmath281 changes by @xmath125 ) .",
    "we thus deduce the appropriate generalization of @xmath289 to be @xmath295 { \\tilde \\psi}[\\phi(x ) ]   \\\\   & \\qquad = \\int{\\cal d}\\phi(x)e^{-i\\int dx(s - m)\\partial_{x}\\phi } \\psi^{\\ast}[\\phi(x - a)]\\psi[\\phi(x ) ] , \\label{generalized1 } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where we resorted to continuum notations in the final expression .",
    "notice that the phase factor in the second line reproduces the correct berry phase while the part @xmath296)^{*}\\psi[\\phi(x)]$ ] is single - valued .    introducing the unitary operator",
    "@xmath297 $ ] and using the relation @xmath298{\\hat t}$ ] , it is easy to see that the counterpart of eq.([generalized1 ] ) for the lsm - twisted state reads @xmath299{\\tilde \\psi}[\\phi(x ) ] \\\\ & \\qquad = \\int{\\cal d}\\phi(x ) \\psi^{\\ast}\\left[\\phi(x - a)-\\frac{2\\pi}{l}a \\right]\\psi[\\phi(x ) ] \\\\ & \\qquad { \\mbox{\\hspace*{15 mm } } } \\times   e^{i2\\pi(s - m)}e^{-i\\int dx ( s - m)\\partial_{x}\\phi } \\end{split}\\ ] ] due to its single - valued nature , @xmath283 $ ] basically factorizes into factors of the form @xmath300 coming from each point @xmath301 .",

    "here we provide the main steps leadings to the berry phases of eq.([vortex bp factors ] ) , which makes extensive use of the boson - vortex duality transformation ( performed at the first quantization level ) .",
    "though the technique is standard , we feel that it may be worthwhile to illustrate how the presence of a topological term brings about modifications and gives rise to vortex berry phases which ultimately dominate the physics at low energy .",
    "we also sketch how to retain this berry phase effect when one switches from the first to the second quantized description of the vortices .      for simplicity we work in the continuum formulation while being careful to take proper account of the berry phases ; carrying out a lattice duality transformation will of course produce the same results .",
    "we begin by introducing a hubbard - stratonovich auxiliary vector field @xmath306 and rewrite the imaginary - time lagrangian density of the effective theory @xmath307=\\int d\\tau d^d { \\bf r}{\\cal l}$ ] as @xmath308 this is followed by a decomposition of the phase field @xmath88 into components with and without vorticity , @xmath309 , where @xmath310 .",

    "\\(i ) @xmath1=1 : we define the density of spacetime vortices @xmath318 via @xmath319 , where @xmath320 is the spacetime coordinate of the @xmath139-th vortex event ( the notation @xmath138 which appeared in eq.([vortex bp factors ] ) in the main text corresponds here to @xmath321 . ) . after an integration by parts and a shifting of the @xmath106-field , @xmath322",
    ", we arrive at @xmath323 integrating over @xmath324 we obtain @xmath325 the first term on the right hand side is the intervortex coulombic interaction for which the kernel @xmath326 was defined in the main text .",
    "the second term represents the vortex berry phase terms , i.e. @xmath327 .",
    "\\(ii ) @xmath1=2 : we start by establishing some notations . the 3-vector @xmath316 in eq.([solution - of - constraint ] ) is often referred to as the vortex gauge field or the dual gauge field ( note the invariance of eq.([solution - of - constraint ] ) ( in ( 2 + 1)d ) with respect to the gauge transformation @xmath328 ) .",
    "dual electric / magnetic fields can be constructed from these gauge fields : @xmath329 they are related to the auxiliary field @xmath330 through @xmath331    upon introducing the vortex 3-current @xmath332 which couples to the dual gauge field , the lagrangian density can be rewritten as @xmath333 we then divide @xmath316 ( choosing a suitable gauge ) into two parts , viz .",
    "@xmath334 , where @xmath335 generates a background magnetic field @xmath336 while @xmath337 represents the deviation from this offset value , @xmath338 .",
    "the gauge is so chosen that @xmath335 does not modify the dual electric field @xmath339 ( a simple choice being @xmath340 ) .",
    "having set up the necessary notations , we can recast eq.([append-2d - lagrange1 ] ) as @xmath341    on integrating over @xmath337 we are left with @xmath342 where the first term on the right hand side is again the coulombic interaction ( now between segments of the spacetime vortex loops ) which is of the form @xmath343 .",
    "the second term assigns a berry phase to each spacetime vortex loop , as we will now see .",
    "since the vortex current field @xmath344 is nonvanishing only on such loops ( with a magnitude equal to the vorticity @xmath345 ) , we can convert the spacetime integration of this term into a sum of contour integrals along each vortex loop ( we use below a short - hand notation @xmath346 to denote a @xmath203-vector @xmath347 ) : @xmath348 the parameter @xmath349)$ ] is used to specify the distance along each loop contour @xmath183 .",

    "since each worldsheet is nothing but the spacetime trajectory of a vortex loop living in 3d space , @xmath365 can be regarded as a vortex loop current . as in the 2 + 1d case",
    "we make the decomposition @xmath366 with the background field satisfying   @xmath367 together with the condition that @xmath368 when one of the indices is @xmath369 .",
    "integrating out @xmath370 , we get @xmath371 the first term is the current - current interaction between worldsheets , while the second is the berry phase term , which contributes to the action a sum of surface integrals on each worldsheet .",
    "the latter converts , upon an application of the stokes - gauss theorem into 3-volume integrals of the flux @xmath372 . since the only nonzero flux component comes from eq.([3d - background - flux ] ) , we find that the vortex berry phase amounts to @xmath373 , where @xmath143 is the 3-volume of the interior of the @xmath139-th worldsheet projected onto the @xmath374-subspace .      the dual theories derived above can be used to obtain the vortex field theories of eq.([vortex - field - theory ] ) .",
    "we give a shortcut version of this procedure for the case of @xmath357 which , as mentioned in the main text , is interesting in view of its relation to the work of lee and shankar@xcite ( the steps for the cases @xmath82 and @xmath356 are essentially the same ) .",
    "we first make the following relabelling in eq.([append-2d - lagrange2 ] ) : @xmath375 , @xmath376 , and @xmath377 .",
