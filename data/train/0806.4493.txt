    "[ t1 ] we see that the temperature deviation of the first iterative solution , @xmath138 , will be suppressed if the temperature initials at pixels of hot source are set to be close to their true values to let @xmath139 .",
    "the initial @xmath140 of pixel @xmath1 can be taken as @xmath141 where @xmath23 means summing over the observations while the pixel @xmath1 is observed by the plus - horn and the pixel pointed by the minus - horn is out of mask , @xmath25 means summing over the observations while the pixel @xmath1 is observed by the minus - horn and the pixel pointed by the plus - horn is out of mask , @xmath142 is the total number of used observations . for the simulated differential data from the true temperatures shown in the upper panel of fig .  10 , we make 50 iterations with eq .",
    "[ mm - w ] starting from initials calculated by eq .  [ tj ] , the distortion structures are satisfactory suppressed in the resultant solution , as shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "we demonstrate in this paper that for existent cmb maps both the observation dependent noise and systematic error induced by foreground emission can not be neglected and both can produce large - scale anomalies and distort the angular power spectrum .",
    "these errors can not be completely excluded by performing noise suppressing or using foreground mask on temperature maps .",
    "we suggest to remake temperature maps from the original wmap time - order - data by a modified algorithm with applying foreground mask in map - making to exclude mask pixels from use in iterations for cmb dominated region ( or properly set temperature initials before iteration ) , and/or keeping used differential data uniform by giving up partial observation data for pixels of high exposure .",
    "new maps from modified map - making algorithm will help us to judge the origin of large scale anomalies detected in released wmap maps , e.g. the low @xmath38 power issues , the unexplained orientation of large - scale patterns in respect to the ecliptic frame , the north - south asymmetry of temperature fluctuation power and the large non - gaussian spots , and to see to what extent the statistical and systematical errors influence the angular power spectrum and the derived cosmological parameters .",
    "believable conclusions on cmb anisotropy anomalies and precise temperature angular power spectrum from differential measurement should be based on temperature maps with homogeneous sky exposure and should avoid foreground - induced distortion during map - making .",
    "this study is supported by the national natural science foundation of china and the cas project kjcx2-yw - t03 .",
    "the data analysis in this work made use of the wmap data archive and the healpix software package .",
