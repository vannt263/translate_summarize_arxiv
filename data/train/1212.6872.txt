    "whereas the present - day mass functions ( mfs ) of globular cluster ( gc ) systems , which are nearly universal among galaxies @xcite , are approximately log - normal with a peak mass @xmath3@xmath1@xmath4 , the mfs of the young massive star cluster ( ymc ) systems follow a simple power - law distribution ( * ? ? ?",

    "in particular , ( * ? ? ? * paper i hereafter ) surveyed a wide range of parameter space for the initial conditions of the milky way gcs , and considered virtually all internal / external processes : two - body relaxation , stellar evolution , binary heating , galactic tidal field , eccentric orbits and disc / bulge shocks .",
    "they found that the initial gc mf that best fits the observed gc mf of the milky way is a log - normal function with a peak at 4@xmath1@xmath5 and a dispersion of 0.33 , which is quite different from the typical mfs of ymcs .    using the outcome of @xmath6-body calculations , @xcite found that the aspect of mass loss in gcs varies with the tidal filling ratio @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the half - mass radius and @xmath9 is the jacobi radius .",
    "more specifically , the mass loss of gcs in the `` isolated regime '' ( @xmath10 ) is driven mostly by the two - body relaxation , which induces the formation of binaries in the core and causes gcs to expand . on the other hand ,",
    "the mass loss of gcs in the `` tidal regime '' ( @xmath11 ) is influenced by the galactic tides as well , which enables stars in the outer envelope to easily escape ( evaporation ) .",
    "thus , the cluster size ( @xmath8 ) is as important as the cluster mass ( @xmath12 ) and the galactocentric radius ( @xmath13 ) in determining the dynamical evolution of gcs .",
    "can ymcs tell us something about the typical initial size of the milky way gc system ?",
    "observations show that the projected half - light radius @xmath14 of ymcs ( ages up to 100 myr ) in the local group ranges between @xmath02 and @xmath030  pc with a mean value of @xmath08  pc @xcite , which is a few times larger than that of the present - day milky way gcs , @xmath15  pc .",
    "however , gcs could have formed in different environments and/or by different mechanisms from the ymcs .    perhaps the best way to estimate",
    "the typical size of the gcs is to trace them back to their initial state by calculating their dynamical evolution . in this paper",

    "our native gc candidates do not include six objects that belong to the sagittarius dwarf , seven objects whose origins remain unknown , two objects that have no size information , and fifteen objects that are thought to be the remnants of dwarf galaxies @xcite . the total number of our present - day galactic native gcs is 93 , and their observed properties , such as luminosity _",

    "the correlation between @xmath14 and @xmath13 is tighter than the other two correlations ( see figure [ obsgcs]@xmath21 )",
    ". this tight @xmath14@xmath13 correlation could be just a result of the initially tight correlation between @xmath14 and @xmath13 , or it could be due to the preferred disruption of large gcs near the galactic center @xcite .",
    "another possible cause is the expansion of initially small gcs up to @xmath22 , which is roughly proportional to @xmath23 for a given gc mass .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is to determine which of these possibilities is more feasible .",
    "previous studies on the evolution of the gc system assumed a certain constant mass - to - light ( _ m / l _ ) ratio , and converted the observed @xmath16 to @xmath12 when comparing their numerical values with observations .",
    "but the conversion of gc luminosity function ( lf ) to gc mf using a constant @xmath24 ratio may lead to mfs in error because low - mass stars , which have higher @xmath25 ratios than the high - mass stars , preferentially evaporate from the cluster and this causes the @xmath25 ratio of the cluster to evolve with time @xcite . for the same reason ,",
    "there is not a linear relationship between @xmath14 and @xmath8 among different gcs .",
    "thus , we transform @xmath12 to @xmath16 , instead of @xmath16 to @xmath12 , using the stellar mass  luminosity relation of the padova model @xcite with a metallicity of @xmath26=-1.16 $ ] , which is the mean value for the galactic native gcs .",
    "our fp calculations , which will be described later , show that the present - day gcs can have @xmath25 ratios ranging between 1.2 and 2.5 and @xmath27 ratios ranging between 1.0 and 2.5 .",

    "values of the two models agree well within @xmath32 during the entire cluster lifetimes . ]",
    "we adopt the anisotropic fp model used in paper i , which was originally developed by ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the model integrates the orbit - averaged fp equation of two ( energy - angular momentum ) dimensions and considers multiple stellar mass components , three - body and tidal - capture binary heating , stellar evolution , tidal fields , disk / bulge shocks , dynamical friction , and realistic ( eccentric ) cluster orbit ( see @xcite for the tidal binary heating and paper i for the detailed implementation of dynamical friction and realistic orbits ) .",
    "the model implements the alternating direction implicit ( adi ) method developed by @xcite for integrating the two - dimensional fp equation with better numerical stability .",
    "parameters for our fp survey are the following four initial cluster conditions : _ m _ , _ @xmath28 _ , apocenter distance of the cluster orbit _",
    "@xmath33 _ , and cluster orbit eccentricity _",
    "e_. we choose eight _ m _ values from @xmath34 to @xmath35 , six _",

    "we choose _ e _ = 0 , 0.25 , 0.5 , and 0.75 .",
    "we perform fp calculations for all possible combinations of these four parameters , thus the total number of cluster models considered in the present study amounts to 1152 .    for the initial stellar mass function ( imf ) within each cluster",
    ", we adopt the model developed by kroupa ( 2001 ) with a mass range of 0.0815  m@xmath40 , which is realized by 15 discrete mass components in our fp model .",
    "each mass component follows the stellar evolution recipe described by @xcite .",
    "the stellar density and velocity dispersion distributions within each cluster follow the king model @xcite with a concentration parameter @xmath41 and with neither initial velocity anisotropy nor initial mass segregation .",
    "we use only one value for @xmath42 , thus the tidal cut - off radius @xmath43 of the king profile is proportional to @xmath8 , while @xmath22 varies depending on @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the roche lobe filling ratio ( @xmath44 ) and @xmath45 of our fp models are functions of @xmath8 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "the aspects of mass and size evolution from our fp model are in a good agreement with those from @xmath6-body methods . a comparison of mass evolution between our fp calculations and the @xmath6-body simulations performed by @xcite for clusters on eccentric orbits with initial masses larger than @xmath46 shows good agreement of cluster lifetimes within @xmath025@xmath47 . for a comparison of size evolution ,",
    "we run a set of @xmath6-body simulations using nbody4 code @xcite with @xmath29 , @xmath30  kpc , and @xmath31  1 , 3 , and 5  pc ( these correspond to @xmath48  0.04 , 0.11 , and 0.18 ) , and find that the @xmath8 evolutions of the two models agree well within @xmath32 during the entire cluster lifetimes ( see figure  [ nbody ] ) .    due to the expulsion of the remnant gas from star formation in the pre - gas - expulsion cluster , some of the low - mass pre - gas expulsion clusters can quickly disrupt , and even the surviving low - mass pre - gas - expulsion clusters will lose a significant fraction of their mass within the first several myr and rapidly expand @xcite . since our fp model does not consider the effect of gas expulsion , our initial gc models are to be regarded as models at several myr after cluster formation .",
    "the three main drivers of gc size evolution are the two - body relaxation , the mass loss by stellar evolution , and the galactic tides . in this section ,",
    "we discuss the size evolution of individual gcs with a subset of our fp calculations .",
    "figure  [ fpresult ] shows the ratios between @xmath28 values at the present time ( 13 gyr ) and at the beginning from our fp calculations as a function of @xmath49 and @xmath50 for two different @xmath51 values ( subscripts 0 denote the initial value , hereafter ) .",
    "two - body relaxation causes gc core to collapse and the subsequent formation of dynamical binaries in the core makes the whole cluster expand . for gcs that have undergone core collapse in the early phase of evolution , the size of the post - core - collapse expansion follows a scaling relation @xmath52 @xcite , and thus for a given initial mass and epoch , @xmath53 is simply proportional to @xmath54 .",
    "figure  [ fpresult ] indeed shows that the size of the gcs with the same @xmath50 tend to converge to a single value ( @xmath55 ) , if the gcs have small @xmath56 ( @xmath57yr  @xmath58 ) .",
    "mass loss by stellar evolution causes gcs to adiabatically expand to maintain virialization , and the gc sizes evolve following @xmath59 when the stellar evolution is the main driver of the gc size evolution @xcite . the combination of kroupa imf and the stellar evolution recipe described by @xcite yields a mass loss of @xmath60 within 13  gyr .",
    "thus , gcs would expand by a factor of @xmath61 as a result of the stellar evolution , if two - body relaxation or the galactic tides are relatively less important in driving the size evolution .",
    "indeed , clusters with @xmath57yr  @xmath62 and @xmath63 have @xmath64 values between 1 and 2 .",
    "while stellar evolution and two - body relaxation cause clusters to expand , galactic tides make clusters shrink in general .",
    "a cluster extending farther than @xmath22 ( overfilling ; @xmath65 ) loses stars outside @xmath22 within a few dynamical timescales , and this naturally causes the mean size of the cluster to decrease . since @xmath66 where @xmath67 is an enclosed mass of the milky way in a given @xmath13 , the size decrease caused by the galactic tides takes place mostly while the cluster approaches @xmath68 .",
    "the cluster re - expands somewhat by two - body relaxation while approaching @xmath69 @xcite , but its size gradually decreases while repeating orbital motions . we find that clusters with @xmath70 can also shrink moderately as a result of the galactic tides even if it underfills , and clusters initially with @xmath71 ( or @xmath10 ; i.e. , `` isolated '' gcs ) can gradually move into the `` tidal '' regime as they lose mass or expand by stellar evolution or two - body relaxation .",
    "figure  [ fpresult ] shows that gcs with larger @xmath72 are smaller at 13  gyr for a given @xmath50 and @xmath51 , as expected .    among various initial gc parameters ,",
    "@xmath49 is the most important parameter in the size evolution caused by two - body relaxation ( @xmath73 ) and that resulting from galactic tides ( @xmath74 for a flat rotation curve ) .",
    "for this reason , initially small gcs generally expand ( by two - body relaxation ) , while initially large gcs generally shrink ( by the galactic tides ) as they evolve .",
    "the size evolution of intermediate gcs is determined by more than one dynamical effect , and some gcs can even maintain their initial size over their whole lifetime .",
    "as discussed in section 3 , we performed a total of 1152 fp calculations with different initial cluster conditions in four - dimensional parameter space , _ m _ , _ @xmath28 _ , _ @xmath33 _ , and _",
    "e_. the goal of the present study is to find the initial distribution of these variables that best describe the observed gcs . for the initial mf model",

    ", the @xmath13 of each fp model evolves by oscillating between @xmath68 and @xmath69 , and thus the model rd at 13 gyr constructed from our population synthesis may suffer from significant random noise . to reduce this noise ,",
    "we build a model rd by summing the probability distributions between @xmath68 and @xmath69 that are given by the orbital information at 13 gyr , and we call this a phase - mixed rd . hereafter , rds in this paper refer to the phase - mixed rd .    for initial sds , we use six distribution models ( see table  [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "models 1 , 2 , and 3 represent a gaussian distribution of @xmath8 , @xmath79 ( mean density within @xmath8 ) , and @xmath45 , respectively , implying that the initial gcs have the preferred initial @xmath8 , @xmath79 , and @xmath45 , with dispersions .",
    "the initial @xmath8 of model 1 does not correlate with the initial @xmath12 or @xmath13 , while models 2 and 3 have initial correlations of @xmath80 and @xmath81 . in models 4 , 5 , and 6 , the initial @xmath8",
    "is determined by powers of initial @xmath12 and/or @xmath13 .",

    "when finding the best set of parameters for each sd model , we minimize the sum of @xmath86 values from all of the @xmath16 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 histograms , which are constructed by using eight bins between @xmath87 and @xmath88 for @xmath16 , nine bins between @xmath38 and @xmath89  kpc for @xmath13 , and nine bins between @xmath90 and @xmath91  pc for @xmath17 , all equally spaced on a logarithmic scale .",
    "recall that we use dynamical ( theoretical ) properties @xmath12 and @xmath8 for setting the initial distributions , while observable quantities such as _ @xmath16 _ and @xmath14 are used for comparing the models and observations .",
    "the best - fit parameter sets that minimize the @xmath92 values between observations and our calculations are presented in table  [ tbl-2 ] for the six sd models .",
    "we examine the characteristics of our best initial mfs , rds and sds in turn .",
    "the best - fit @xmath93 values for all six sd models are quite low , ranging between 0.01 and 0.07 .",
    "the best - fit @xmath94m@xmath40 values for all six sd models are similar to each other , having values between 5.8 and 5.9 .",
    "note that schechter functions with such small @xmath93 values are similar to log - normal functions , while those of @xmath95 are closer to power - law functions .",
    "thus , our small @xmath93 values suggest that log - normal functions better describe the initial mf of the galactic gc system than power - law functions ( see figure  [ mfrdsd]@xmath96 ) , and this result is consistent with the result of paper i. one way to explain the log - normal - like initial mf is expulsion of the remnant gas due to star formation in the pre - gas - expulsion cluster , which can quickly alter a power - law mf into a log - normal - like mf @xcite .",
    "another possible mechanism resulting in a rapid change in the initial mf is the collisions of clusters with dense clouds or other clusters during the early phase of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "initial rds from the best - fit parameter sets for all six sd models have similar @xmath97 values ( 4.04.5 ) but a rather wide range of @xmath98 values ( 0.33.6  kpc ) , and this is consistent with the result of paper i ( @xmath99 and @xmath100  kpc ) .    figure  [ mfrdsd]@xmath21 shows that most of the gcs that disrupt before 13  gyr are located in the bulge regime ( @xmath101  kpc ) , and most of the gcs formed in the bulge do not survive until now .",
    "we find that only 0.18.4  % of the total gc mass initially inside 3  kpc remains in gcs at 13  gyr , and the total stellar mass that escaped from the gcs inside 3  kpc during the last 13  gyr amounts to @xmath102@xmath103 m@xmath40 , depending on the sd model .            ]",
    "the initial sds from our best - fit parameter sets are of larger dispersion than the present - day sds for all six sd models ( see figure  [ mfrdsd]@xmath104 ) . the initial sds evolve into the narrower present - day sds by two main effects : ( 1 ) expansion of gcs with small @xmath49 , which normally have small @xmath56 and/or small @xmath72 , due to two - body relaxation , and ( 2 ) shrinkage ( evaporation ) of large @xmath49 gcs , which normally have large @xmath56 and/or large @xmath72 , due to the galactic tides .",
    "figure  [ size ] shows that the sds of initially small gcs ( upper panels ) indeed shift to the larger @xmath8 region and those of initially large gcs ( lower panels ) shift to the smaller @xmath8 region after 13  gyr .",
    "three @xmath105-values ( significance levels ) for @xmath92 tests of lfs , rds , and sds are acceptably high , except for model 3 , which has relatively small @xmath92 @xmath105-values for rds and sds ( see table  [ tbl-2 ] ) . however",
    ", the high @xmath105-values from the @xmath92 tests do not necessarily guarantee that the models with the best - fit parameters restore the observed correlation between @xmath16 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 as well .",
    "thus , we implement student s @xmath106-tests to see if our models with the best - fit parameters agree with the observed @xmath13 dependence of sds ( the @xmath14@xmath13 correlation ) , the @xmath16 dependence of sds ( the @xmath14@xmath16 correlation ) , and @xmath13 dependence of lfs ( the @xmath16@xmath13 correlation ) . for the @xmath14@xmath13 correlation , we calculate @xmath92 for the difference of @xmath107 and @xmath108 between the model and the observation as follows : @xmath109 where subscripts @xmath110 and @xmath111 stand for the observation and the model , respectively , subscript @xmath112 represents the equal number @xmath13 bins , and @xmath113 denotes the averaged values .",
    "the same calculation is applied to @xmath14@xmath16 and @xmath16@xmath13 correlation as well .",
    "we find that models 36 have @xmath106-test @xmath105-values that are too small ( @xmath114 ) for at least one of the @xmath14@xmath13 , @xmath14@xmath16 , and @xmath16@xmath13 correlation .",
    "for this reason , we reject models 36 as being a plausible initial sd candidate .",
    "hereafter , we call sd models 1 and 2 `` the final best - fit sd models '' .    figures  [ model1 ] and [ model2 ] show our two remaining best - fit sd models , a gaussian distribution of @xmath8 ( model 1 ; @xmath115  pc , @xmath116  pc ) and a gaussian distribution of @xmath79 ( model 2 ; @xmath117 , @xmath118 ) . note that @xmath49 values are not correlated with the @xmath51 in either model .",
    "this implies that the @xmath49 of gcs probably does not depend on the strength of the galactic tides .",
    "therefore , we interpret the observed , present - day @xmath14@xmath13 correlation ( see figure  [ obsgcs]@xmath21 ) as an outcome of a preferential disruption of the larger gcs at smaller @xmath13 due to the galactic tides .",
    "the typical @xmath119 value from our final best - fit sd models ( models 1 and 2 ) is @xmath120  pc ( @xmath121  pc ) , and this is 1.8 times larger than that of the present - day gcs ( @xmath122  pc ) .",
    "this result is rather different from a recent argument by @xcite that most gcs were born compact with @xmath123  pc .",
    "our result implies that gcs initially have a rather wide sd , the typical value of which is similar to that of ymcs in parsec scale , and have evolved to have a narrower sd with a smaller mean value .",
    "we also find that gcs formation favors a `` tidal '' environment over an `` isolated '' environment .",
    "the number of tidal gcs ( @xmath85 ) at 0  gyr from our final best - fit sd models is approximately five times larger than that of isolated gcs ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "the ratio of tidal to isolated gcs , however , drastically decreases as gcs evolve because tidal gcs are more easily disrupted , and this ratio becomes @xmath124 at 13  gyr .",
    "figure  [ trace ] shows the initial sds of the gcs that survive until 13  gyr in models 1 and 2 .",
    "we find that these initial sds are broader ( @xmath125 and 2.5  pc , respectively ) and centered at higher values ( @xmath126 = 4.1 and 4.0  pc ) than the currently observed sd ( @xmath127  pc , @xmath128  pc ) .",
    "thus , the overall size of the gcs were larger at birth than now by a factor of @xmath129 even when only the surviving gcs are considered .",
    "the initial total masses in gcs ( @xmath130 ) of the final best - fit sd models are 2.8@xmath1@xmath131 ( model 1 ) and 5.3@xmath1@xmath131 ( model 2 ) , and the masses that have left the gcs during the lifetime of the galaxy ( @xmath132 ) are 2.5@xmath1@xmath131 ( model 1 ) and 5.0@xmath1@xmath131 ( model 2 ) .",
    "these give @xmath133 values of 0.89 and 0.94 for models 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "our @xmath132 values are several times larger than previous estimates made by @xcite , @xcite , and paper i ( 1.51.8@xmath134@xmath131 ) .",
    "our larger @xmath132 values are due to the facts that ( 1 ) we consider virtually all disruption mechanisms in the calculations for the dynamical evolution of individual gcs , and ( 2 ) we use more a flexible initial @xmath8 distribution , which can have a relatively larger fraction of gcs with a large @xmath8 ( larger gcs are more vulnerable to the galactic tide ) . note that @xmath132 will be larger if one considers the clusters that have been disrupted in the process of remnant gas expulsion .",
    "we note that contrary to the finding in the present paper , detailed dynamical modeling of individual clusters shows that at least some of the clusters must have started with a very small size .",
    "for example , monte carlo calculations by @xcite and @xcite find 0.58 pc , 0.40 pc , and 1.9 pc as best - fit initial @xmath8 values for the observed current states of m4 , ngc 6397 , and 47 tuc , respectively .",
    "these values are several times smaller than the typical initial @xmath8 found for the galactic gc system from our calculations , @xmath135  pc .",
    "however , we also note that the monte carlo models used for these three clusters all assume circular cluster orbits while m4 and ngc 6397 have moderate to high orbit eccentricities ( 0.82 and 0.34 , respectively ) .",
    "we have performed several fp calculations for these two clusters and find that consideration of appropriate eccentric orbits can increase the best - fit initial @xmath8 by a factor of 35 .",
    "we have calculated the dynamical evolution of galactic gcs using the most advanced and realistic fp model , and searched a wide parameter space for the best - fitting initial sd , mf , and rd models that evolve into the present - day distribution .",
    "we found the initial mf of the galactic gc system is similar to the log - normal function rather than the power - law function , and the rd of the gc system undergoes significant evolution inside @xmath136  kpc through the strong galactic tides .",
    "we also found that the initial sd of the gc system evolves to narrower present - day sds through two effects : shrinkage of large gcs by the galactic tides and expansion of small gcs by two - body relaxation .",
    "the typical initial projected half - mass radius from the final best - fit model , @xmath137  pc , is 1.8 times larger than that of the present - day value , @xmath138  pc .",
    "the ratio of `` tidal '' gcs to `` isolated '' gcs is @xmath139 at 0 gyr and decreases down to @xmath124 at 13 gyr .",
    "since tidal gcs are found to be dominant in the beginning , one might expect the initial size of the gcs to be correlated with the jacobi radius , i.e. , to be a function of the galactocentric radius",
    ". however , our final best - fit sd models ( models 1 and 2 ) do not seem connected to the galactocentric radius .",
    "this implies that the gc formation process favors a certain size and density , regardless of the tidal environment .",

    "<S> despite the importance of their size evolution in understanding the dynamical evolution of globular clusters ( gcs ) of the milky way , studies are rare that focus specifically on this issue . based on the advanced , realistic fokker  </S>",
    "<S> planck ( fp ) approach , we predict theoretically the initial size distribution ( sd ) of the galactic gcs along with their initial mass function and radial distribution . </S>",
    "<S> over one thousand fp calculations in a wide parameter space have pinpointed the best - fit initial conditions for the sd , mass function , and radial distribution . </S>",
    "<S> our best - fit model shows that the initial sd of the galactic gcs is of larger dispersion than today s sd , and that typical projected half - light radius of the initial gcs is @xmath04.6  pc , which is 1.8 times larger than that of the present - day gcs ( @xmath02.5  pc ) . </S>",
    "<S> their large size signifies greater susceptibility to the galactic tides : the total mass of destroyed gcs reaches 35@xmath1@xmath2 , several times larger than the previous estimates . </S>",
    "<S> our result challenges a recent view that the milky way gcs were born compact on the sub - pc scale , and rather implies that ( 1 ) the initial gcs are generally larger than the typical size of the present - day gcs , ( 2 ) the initially large gcs mostly shrink and/or disrupt as a result of the galactic tides , and ( 3 ) the initially small gcs expand by two - body relaxation , and later shrink by the galactic tides . </S>"
