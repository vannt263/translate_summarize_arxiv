    "if a massive galaxy lies along the line of sight to a background quasar , the galaxy may act as a gravitational lens , magnifying and forming multiple images of the quasar . beginning with the pioneering work of @xcite ,",
    "many authors have computed the number of lenses that should appear in well - defined samples of quasars , with particular attention given to the dependence of this statistic on the vacuum energy density @xcite .",
    "these calculations must take into account not only the probability that a massive galaxy will be aligned closely enough with a background quasar ( the lensing cross - section ) , but also the enhancement of the quasar flux due to lensing ( the magnification bias ) .",
    "this is because quasar samples are usually defined by observed flux in some wavelength band , and gravitational lensing boosts the observed flux , thereby sampling a fainter portion of the quasar luminosity function .",
    "for example , if intrinsically faint quasars are sufficiently more numerous than bright quasars , then a quasar with a given observed flux is more likely to be lensed than the cross - section alone would imply .",
    "more recently attention has turned toward the information about galaxy mass profiles that can be gleaned from lens statistics .",
    "these statistics include lensing rates ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the ratio of four - image to two - image lenses ( see , e.g. , * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "all of these applications of lens statistics require a good understanding of magnification bias .",
    "@xcite noted that quasar samples selected by both radio and optical flux measurements are subject to what they called a `` double magnification bias . ''",
    "if the radio and optical fluxes from a given quasar are nearly independent , then quasars bright in both bands are especially likely to be lensed . by assuming that gravitational lensing produces only one possible value of magnification , and using power - law luminosity functions for the optical and radio bands",
    ", @xcite showed that the resulting two - band magnification bias is the product of the bias factors computed separately for each band .",
    "it is timely to revisit the issue of multi - band magnification bias with a more general approach . with the advent of large - area sky surveys at many wavelengths ,",
    "it has become possible to define samples of thousands of quasars by their observed fluxes in x - ray , optical , infrared , and radio bands .",
    "quasars appear in large numbers in , for example , the rass ( rosat all - sky survey : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "a few lenses have already been discovered using multi - band selection criteria , at lensing rates that are larger than the 0.21% typical of single - band lens surveys .",
    "@xcite discovered the gravitational lens rx  j0911.4 + 0551 by matching rass sources with optical sources from schmidt plates .",
    "of the @xmath0 radio - quiet x - ray  luminous high - redshift quasars known , two are lensed @xcite .",
    "a search for very red quasars through the matching of first and 2mass has identified two gravitational lenses out of thirteen sources @xcite .",
    "none of these projects were designed explicitly to discover gravitational lenses , although this is a realistic possibility for the future .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the magnification bias for quasar samples defined by measurements in multiple wavelength bands . after presenting the basic formalism for @xmath1 bands (  [ sec : mbias ] )",
    ", we specialize to the case of two bands and consider some illustrative examples .",
    "we consider the cases in which the two fluxes are uncorrelated (  [ subsec : independent ] ) , perfectly correlated (  [ subsec : perfectly - correlated ] ) , and correlated with non - zero scatter (  [ subsec : correlated ] ) .",
    "we then use a realistic model of the optical luminosity function for quasars to demonstrate a few interesting properties of the multi - band magnification bias (  [ sec : examples ] ) ; in particular , the bias does not necessarily increase with flux in each band , and there is a profound difference between the case of a linear correlation and a non - linear correlation with flux in another band . finally , in  [ sec : discussion ] we summarize our results , and discuss possible applications of this formalism to real quasar samples .",
    "we begin by reviewing the case of single - band magnification bias @xcite . in a sample of quasars at redshift @xmath2 with ( apparent",
    "is the luminosity inferred from the observed flux and the luminosity distance , without taking into account the possible magnification due to lensing . ] ) luminosity @xmath3 , the fraction of multiple - image lensed quasars is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the cross - section for multiple imaging , and @xmath6 is the magnification bias . for @xmath7 and @xmath8 ,",
    "this reduces to the usual expression @xmath9 .",
    "the magnification bias is evaluated as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the quasar luminosity function , @xmath12 is the sum of the unsigned magnifications of the multiple images , and @xmath13 is the probability distribution for @xmath12 , taken for a singular isothermal sphere throughout the paper ( @xmath14 for @xmath15 ) .",
    "this expression can be understood as a likelihood ratio .",
    "the denominator is the likelihood that the quasar is drawn from the sample of unlensed quasars with luminosity @xmath3 ( within @xmath16 ) .",
    "the numerator is the likelihood that the quasar is drawn from the fainter sample of quasars with luminosity @xmath17 ( within @xmath18 ) , summed over all possible values of @xmath12",
    ".    understood this way , the generalization to @xmath1 bands is straightforward .",
    "we require knowledge of the multivariate luminosity function , @xmath19 . for a point source ,",
    "the magnification is the same for all bands , because gravitational lensing is achromatic .",
    "the multi - band magnification bias is therefore @xmath20    the dependence of @xmath21 on the apparent luminosities of the quasars depends on the correlations , if any , between the intrinsic luminosities of the quasars in those bands . to illustrate the interesting properties that can result , in the following sections we concentrate on the simplest non - trivial case , the two - band magnification bias .",
    "all of the results are easily generalized to @xmath1 bands .",
    "@xcite considered quasars observed at both optical and radio wavelengths , and assumed a power - law luminosity function for each band .",
    "they showed that if the fluxes in these bands are statistically independent , and if there is only one possible value of the lensing magnification , then the two - band magnification bias is equal to the product of the biases that would be computed separately for the optical and radio bands .",
    "this result is not true in general . as we show below",
    ", even if the two bands are independent , the result does not hold because real gravitational lenses produce a distribution of magnifications .",
    "first , we reproduce the result of @xcite using our formalism . for @xmath22 , eq .  ( [ eq : multi - band - mbias ] ) is @xmath23 if the bands are independent , then @xmath24 . the lens model used by @xcite",
    "can be described by @xmath25 , in which case @xmath26    this results fails for the more realistic case in which there is a range of possible magnifications , because @xmath13 appears once in the numerator of the multi - band magnification bias , but appears separately in each numerator in the product of the single - band biases .",
    "for example , following @xcite , suppose @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "if we adopt the magnification distribution appropriate for an isothermal sphere ( @xmath29 for all @xmath15 ) , then @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "analogous calculations of the single - band bias factors give @xmath32 which can be either larger or smaller than eq .",
    "( [ eq : two - band - mbias - power - law ] ) .",
    "if the two bands are perfectly correlated , with @xmath33 , one might expect that no new information is provided by the observation in the second band , and therefore that the two - band bias is equal to the single - band bias for either band . this is not quite true .",
    "gravitational magnification multiplies both fluxes by the same factor .",
    "if the unmagnified fluxes are linearly correlated , then the magnified fluxes also obey the correlation . however , if the correlation is non - linear , then the magnified fluxes do not obey the correlation , and the source must be gravitationally lensed . in the the appendix",
    ", we derive this result formally , by calculating the magnification bias for general correlations ( see the next section ) in the limit of zero scatter .      more generally ,",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath34 are correlated with some intrinsic scatter . on physical grounds",
    "we expect the magnitude of the scatter to scale with the luminosity [ i.e. @xmath35 , which makes it convenient to use logarithmic variables @xmath36 .",
    "suppose that the correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath34 is a power - law , @xmath37 , or @xmath38 .",
    "because of the correlation , it is convenient to express the luminosity function in terms of the new variables @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which describe the location parallel and perpendicular to the correlation , respectively ( see fig .

    "is @xmath41 .",
    "the luminosity function can also be written @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the luminosity function in the new variable @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the conditional probability of @xmath46 given @xmath44 . because we expect the scatter to be symmetric in reflection about the correlation and @xmath47 .",

    "furthermore , if @xmath58 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath44 , then we find that @xmath59 is an increasing function of both @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( since @xmath46 increases monotonically with both @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) .",
    "this example will be further explored in case 1 of  [ sec : examples ] .",
    "( [ transform_bias2 ] ) also demonstrates the behavior arising from non - linear correlations ( @xmath62 ) . here",
    "the exponential plays an important role ; it introduces an asymmetry in the bias across the correlation .",
    "if , for example , @xmath63 , then large biases can result from negative values of @xmath46 ( i.e. below the correlation ) , because the exponent becomes positive . on the other hand ,",
    "the exponent is negative for all @xmath64 , and hence the bias above the correlation is small .",
    "this example will be further explored in case 3 of  [ sec : examples ] .    in the following section ,",
    "we evaluate eq .",
    "[ transform_bias2 ] numerically , with more realistic assumptions , in order to illustrate these and other interesting and potentially observable properties of the multi - band magnification bias .",

    "magnification draws quasars from regions of lower intrinsic luminosity , where the probability density of quasars ( as given by @xmath80 ) is larger .",
    "this is especially true when the observed luminosities fall at some distance from the correlation , because the scatter in the correlation is larger at lower luminosities .",
    "+ the dependence of @xmath56 on @xmath34 , for fixed @xmath3 , is again shown by the thick dark dashed line .",
    "interestingly , the dependence is not monotonic . for small values of @xmath34",
    "the magnification bias is large",
    ". the bias decreases as @xmath34 rises through the expected intrinsic value , and then increases again .",
    "the bias along the path denoted by the thin dashed line demonstrates that the bias can become very large for sources below the correlation .",

    "[ fig : bias - non - linear - correlation ] , in the same format as the previous examples .",

    "this runs counter to the naive expectation that the brighter the quasar is ( regardless of band ) , the more likely it is to be lensed .",
    "the reason is that when @xmath34 is smaller than expected from the correlation , reducing both luminosities by the same factor @xmath12 ( along a line of unit slope , in the top left panel ) brings one to a region of much higher probability .",
    "@xmath90 , @xmath91 : an anti - correlation with constant scatter .",
    "this is a somewhat artificial example , but we might imagine there are two ways for a quasar with a fixed energy source to radiate its energy , and one of these ways can be blocked by a variable amount .",

    "the multi - band magnification bias is an _ a posteriori _ statistic .",

    "both fluxes must be used to perform this calculation .",
    "one must also have some knowledge of the intrinsic correlation ( if any ) of the fluxes , and the distribution of magnifications produced by lensing .",
    "one might expect that the multi - band bias is maximized when the bands are uncorrelated ( an example of which is shown for the radio - optical correlation of sdss early data release quasars in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , since in that case there is no redundant information in the flux measurements . upon further reflection , or using the mathematics developed in this paper , one realizes that this is not true ",
    "the relevant information is how discrepant the observed fluxes are from the correlation , and whether the discrepancy can be made smaller if the observed fluxes are all reduced by a constant factor .",
    "many of the illustrative examples presented in this paper approximate certain correlations that have been observed for real quasars .",
    "in particular , the multi - band magnification bias may result in very high lens fractions for certain quasar samples .",
