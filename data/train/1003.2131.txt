    "there abides a deep fascination with the subject of prime terms in naturally occurring integer sequences . the fanfare which accompanies the discovery of each new mersenne prime @xcite bears testimony , as does the search for factorizations of the fermat and fibonacci numbers @xcite .",

    "the first systematic study of elliptic divisibility sequences was given majestically by morgan ward in @xcite .",
    "recent times have witnessed a great deal of activity ( the following represents a sample ) because of their intrinsic interest @xcite as well as in applications to logic @xcite and cryptography @xcite .",
    "the chudnovsky brothers  @xcite first proposed studying primality in elliptic divisibility sequences arising from elliptic curves in weierstrass form .",
    "this was continued in @xcite with the following outcome : a heuristic argument , together with lots of computational evidence and proofs in some special cases , suggests that any elliptic divisibility sequence contains only finitely many prime terms .",
    "this has become known as the _ primality conjecture _ for elliptic curves in weierstrass form . in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.1 ) the same conjecture was proved for curves in homogeneous form .",
    "it is with such curves that our business lies in this paper .",

    "it is sometimes said that  @xmath1 is a twist of the fermat cubic .",
    "the set of rational ( or real ) points form a group under the chord and tangent method : the ( projective ) point at infinity with homogeneous coordinates @xmath4 is the identity , and inversion is given by reflection in the line @xmath5 . given a nontorsion point @xmath6 ,",
    "write , in lowest terms ,    @xmath7    the sequence @xmath8 is a ( strong ) divisibility sequence , see proposition  [ strongdivseq ] .",

    ". this will be explained in detail in subsection  [ cubefree ] .",
    "it is also probable that a uniform bound on the index  @xmath14 would follow from the hall - lang conjecture , as in recent work of mah  @xcite .",

    "this completes the proof of the claim , and of proposition  [ strongdivseq ] .",
    "we conclude with a remark justifying the assumption in both our theorems that  @xmath3 is cube - free .",
    "the key remark needed follows from proposition  [ strongdivseq ] : if @xmath211 then @xmath212 . from (",

    "if  @xmath220 denotes the resulting denominator then  @xmath221 is a prime power by the starting remark .",
    "therefore , by expanding  @xmath213 arbitrarily , we see that , at the cost only of multiplying  @xmath3 by a cube , we may produce elliptic divisibility sequences with arbitrarily large numbers of prime power terms .",
    "we will prove firstly that , for @xmath222 , the term @xmath66 in the denominator is not completely cancelled . from  (",
    "* theorem 2.3 ) , all terms  @xmath66 with  @xmath222 possess a primitive prime divisor  @xmath223 . then  @xmath224 , because  @xmath223 is a primitive prime divisor , so it follows that @xmath36 is a point of good reduction for  @xmath223 .",
    "thus all multiples of  @xmath36 , in particular  @xmath164 , are points of good reduction . however ,",
    "for primes dividing @xmath185 , the point on the reduced curve with @xmath166-coordinate zero is a point of bad reduction so it follows that @xmath225 .",

    "secondly , from  ( * ? ? ?",

    "it follows that the number of prime power terms @xmath9 is bounded by  @xmath231 , a uniform constant .",
