    "<S> after the fluctuating potential is withdrawn and the level returns to the resonant position , the stationary current will not recover its resonant value . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the stationary current heavily depends on the history of the fluctuating potential during the transient period , and thus provide an efficient way of controlling the ness without changing the temperatures and chemical potentials of the reservoirs .    </S>",
