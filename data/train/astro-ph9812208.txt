    "the x  ray properties of black hole x  ray binaries in the `` low state '' are strikingly similar to those of atoll sources ( accreting low magnetic field neutron stars ) in the `` island state '' ( van der klis 1994a , b ) .",
    "both emit x  ray spectra that are dominated by a hard power law component , @xmath1 , whose photon index @xmath2 increases ( i.e. whose spectra soften ) as the mass accretion rate , @xmath3 , increases ( tanaka & lewin 1995 ; barret & vedrenne 1994 , van paradijs & van der klis 1994 ) .",
    "the power density spectra of the x  ray flux variations of both types of sources are dominated by a broad - band component , which is flat below a break frequency , @xmath4 , and turns to a power law , @xmath5 above @xmath6 , with @xmath7 just above the break ( see van der klis 1995 ) .    as @xmath3 increases ,",
    "so does @xmath6 ; the observed values of @xmath6 are similar for the black hole and neutron star systems and cover the range 0.01 to 30 hz .",
    "as @xmath6 varies , the high  frequency part of the power density spectrum tends to remain the same ( belloni & hasinger 1990 ; miyamoto et al .",
    "1992 ) , although this relation is not always exact in detail .",
    "generally it is observed that the power level of the flat part of the power density spectrum is anti - correlated with @xmath6 ( and @xmath3 ) in black hole candidates ( & van der klis 1997 and references therein ) and in neutron stars ( yoshida et al .",
    "1983 , prins & van der klis 1997 , ford & van der klis 1998 , et al . 1998 ) .",
    "another characteristic of the low states of black hole x  ray binaries ( bhxb ) is the phase lag of high - energy photons with respect to low - energy photons ( `` hard lags '' ) in flux variations covering time scales between @xmath8 to @xmath9 s ( see miyamoto et al . 1992 ) .",
    "this phase lag is roughly constant over this range , at a level of order 0.1 radians , and does not vary much with @xmath6 ( i.e. @xmath3 ) for a given source or between sources .",
    "these phase lags have been interpreted ( eg . payne 1980 ) as travel time differences of photons in a hot compton scattering electron gas ( e.g. sunyaev & trmper 1979 ) , which is also the medium in which the power law photon spectrum is thought to be formed ( e.g. hua & titarchuk 1995 ; dove et al .",
    "in accreting neutron stars , lags have been measured in the kilohertz oscillation signals ( vaughan et al . 1997 ; 1998 ) .",
    "these very small lags put stringent constraints on the physical size of any cloud which might comptonize the photons in the fast signals .",
    "it is clearly of interest to know whether the similarities between island  state atoll sources and low  state bhxbs extends to their time lag properties .",
    "we present here the results of a time lag analysis of two atoll sources at frequencies below 100 hz and compare the results to an identical analysis of two bhxbs .    in section 2",
    "we describe the observations , and data analysis .",
    "the results of our analysis are presented in section 3 .",
    "they are discussed in the framework of the comptonization model in section 4 .",
    "we conclude that this model has fundamental problems .",
    "we have used data from the rossi x  ray timing explorer ( rxte ) proportional counter array ( pca ) obtained during the first three observing cycles ( see table  [ tbl : obs ] ) . we choose four sources : 1 and 339 , which are thought to contain black holes ( tanaka & lewin 1995 ) , and 0614 and 705 , which are atoll sources showing x  ray bursts and therefore contain neutron stars . in these observations",
    "the bhxbs are in the ` low ' state and the atoll sources are in the ` island ' state .",
    "they have similar fourier power spectra which can be fitted by a broken power law , with break frequencies of 0.18 , 0.07 , 1.8 , and 3.6 hz for 1 , 339 , 705 , and 0614 respectively , and rms fractions of 29% , 36% , 22% , and 31% ( 2 to 9 kev , 0.01 to 100 hz ) .",
    "the mean count rates are 4973 , 586 , 580 , and 228 counts s@xmath10 ( 2 to 9 kev , background subtracted for the whole pca ) , with small long term variability .    to quantify the difference in variability between two energy bands we use the cross spectrum defined as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 are the measured complex fourier coefficients for the two energy bands at a frequency @xmath13 ( van der klis et al .",
    "1987 ; for information on cross correlation analysis see vaughan et al . 1994 ; vaughan & nowak 1997 ; nowak et al .",
    "the phase lag , @xmath14 , between the signals in the two bands is given by the argument of @xmath15 ( its position angle in the complex plane ) .",
    "the corresponding time lag at fourier frequency , @xmath16 , is simply @xmath17 .",
    "we calculate an average cross  vector , @xmath15 , by averaging over multiple spectra and binning in frequency , and then find @xmath14 .",
    "we calculate the error in @xmath14 from the observed variance of the @xmath15 values in the real and imaginary directions .",
    "the resulting error is similar to , but slightly larger than , that derived from counting statistics ( vaughan et al .",
    "1994 ; cui et al .",
    "1997 ) , or ( equivalently ) from the coherence function uncorrected for counting statistics ( nowak et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "we calculate cross  spectra from data intervals of 256 sec and use a nyquist frequency of 2048 hz , which is high enough to avoid binning effects that dominate at frequencies above half the nyquist frequency ( crary et al .",
    "1998 ) . as",
    "the resulting @xmath14 depends somewhat on the choice of energy band , becoming larger for wider energy separations , we choose the energy bands to be closely similar .",
    "we choose two energy bands defined as effectively 2 to 9 kev and 9 to 33 kev .",
    "these bands correspond to pca channels 035 and 36127 for the 1 observations , and channels 025 and 2687 for the other data which were taken after a detector gain change in march 1996 .",
    "we correct for deadtime effects by subtracting from @xmath15 an average value obtained from 800 to 1024 hz where poisson noise dominates ( van der klis et al .",
    "this correction is close to negligible .",
    "a positive value of @xmath14 corresponds to a lag of the hard band relative to the soft band , a result we have confirmed by analyzing test signals and looking at data from the accreting millisecond x  ray pulsar saxj1808.43658 .",
    "the results of the phase delay analysis are summarized in figure  [ fig : pdel ] . in all four sources the hard photons",
    "lag the soft photons significantly . even in 0614 , where the statistics are the worst",
    ", the lag is detectable with a significance greater than 5@xmath18 in the 1 to 10 hz range .",
    "averaging over the 0.01 to 100 hz range , the @xmath14 values are @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 radians for 1 , 339 , 705 , and 0614 , respectively . in 705 and 0614 ,",
    "the lags are significant only above 1 hz ; over the range 0.011 hz @xmath14 is @xmath23 and @xmath24 radians respectively .",
    "the significance of the phase lags is a factor of 3 to 10 better for the bhxbs than for the atoll sources . in 1",
    "this is because of the high count rate . in 339",
    "it is a result of the high rms fraction of the noise and long integration time .",
    "we calculate the expected significances which are a function of the rate , rms fraction , observing time and coherence ( nowak et al .",
    "compared to 0614 , the significances should be better by factors of 13 , 14 , and 3 in 1 , 339 , and 705 , respectively , similar to what we have observed .",
    "there is structure visible for @xmath14 as a function of frequency in the bhxbs ( miyamoto et al .",
    "1992 ) , in particular @xmath14 increases somewhat with frequency .",
    "the lags are not , however , consistent with a constant time lag as shown by the dotted lines in figure  [ fig : pdel ] .",
    "in addition to the phase delay , we measure the coherence , defined by @xmath25 ( vaughan & nowak 1997 ) .",
    "the angle brackets represent averages over multiple cross  spectra and fourier frequencies . if the cross vectors have the same phase angles ,",
    "@xmath26 is unity ; if the phases are random , @xmath26 is zero .",
    "we corrected @xmath26 for the contribution from poisson noise ( see vaughan & nowak 1997 ) ; this correction significantly changes the calculated values .",
    "we calculate the error of the noise  corrected @xmath26 according to the prescription of vaughan & nowak ( 1997 ) in the high  coherence , high  variability regime applicable to our data below 100 hz .",
    "figure  [ fig : g2 ] shows the results .",
    "the coherence is consistent with unity for all sources .",
    "we have presented the first measurements of phase lags and coherence in the band limited noise below 100 hz in accreting neutron stars .",
    "we find that the phase lags of the atoll sources 705 and 0614 in the island state are very similar to those of bhxbs in the low state as reported here and by previous authors ( page et al .",
    "1981 ; miyamoto et al . 1988 ; miyamoto et al . 1992 ; nowak et al . 1998 ; pottschmidt et al . 1998 ) . in the noise at frequencies between 0.01 and 100 hz , hard x",
    " rays lag soft x  rays .",
    "the average phase delays that we measure in this frequency range are 0.09 and 0.07 radians for 705 and 0614 , and 0.08 and 0.09 radians for the low - state bhxbs 1 and 339 .",
    "the lags are not consistent with a constant time delay .",
    "we discuss our results within the framework of the idea that the x  ray photons in the power - law spectral component are the result of compton upscattering of low - energy seed photons , probably produced in the accretion disk , by a very hot electron gas .",
    "this implies that the energy emitted in x ",
    "rays first resides in energetic electrons , which subsequently lose part of their energy to low - energy photons in the scattering processes . in this comptonization model , a low energy photon on average gains energy in each scattering event .",
    "higher energy photons , on average , are the result of more scatterings . therefore the higher energy photons emerge later than the lower energy photons produced simultaneously , since the total path length they traverse is larger due to more scatterings .",
    "the measured unity coherence in all sources argues for such a model as opposed to scenarios where signals at different energies are produced in disconnected regions ( vaughan & nowak 1997 ) .    in simple versions of compton scattering in a uniform cloud ,",
    "one expects a constant time lag between photons in different energy bands independent of frequency ( wijers et al .",
    "1987 ) , i.e. the phase lag , @xmath14 , is expected to increase proportionally to the fourier frequency , @xmath16 , at least when the fourier period is larger than the typical time delay .",
    "this is inconsistent with the data as noted previously .",
    "the recent work of kazanas , hua & titarchuk ( 1997 ; kht97 ) and hua , kazanas & titarchuk ( 1997 ; hkt97 ) , however , shows that a scattering medium with a radial density gradient can produce phase lags roughly constant in frequency .",
    "we also note that in the atoll sources there are also quasi - periodic oscillation signals in excess of 1000 hz which are thought to originate very close to the neutron star .",
    "the upper limits to any hard phase lags in these signals is small ( vaughan et al . 1998 ) . for a medium which induces constant time delays ,",
    "the measured lags of these fast signals should have been large .",
    "the size of the comptonizing region is large .",
    "our measurements of a 0.02 sec lag at 1 hz for the neutron stars and 0.2 sec at 0.1 hz for the black holes correspond to a size of order @xmath27 km for moderate optical depths . even in the kht97 and hkt97 models with non  constant density",
    ", the scattering medium extends up to at least @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the schwarzschild radius . at the same time a large fraction of the total luminosity is released in hard x ",
    "rays which are apparently produced by the comptonizing medium .",
    "relative to the flux in the 0.1100 kev band , in our observations 1 emits 65% of its energy above 9 kev ; in 705 this fraction is 25% .",
    "the question then arises : how can a substantial fraction of the emitted x ",
    "ray luminosity , which must originate from the conversion of gravitational potential energy into heat close to the compact object , reside in hot electron gas at distances of order @xmath30 away from the compact object ?",
    "energy production around accreting neutron stars was considered early on ( zeldovich & shakura 1969 ) .",
    "the energy problem discussed above has been raised by recent authors ( e.g. stollman et al .",
    "1987 ) .    for the black hole systems one might argue that the energy budget in hot electron gas at distances of order @xmath31 cm _ is _ sufficient to account for a substantial part of the observed x  ray luminosity via compton upscattering .",
    "the required mass accretion rate then has to be of order @xmath32 m@xmath33 ,",
    "i.e. , several orders of magnitude above the value inferred from the observed x  ray luminosities of @xmath34 erg / s .",
    "the consequence of this is that the accretion flow within @xmath35 cm of the black hole must have a very low radiative efficiency , which suggests that it is advection - dominated ( see , e.g. , narayan & yi 1994 ) . in this picture",
    "it would be the advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) itself which provides the site for comptonization .",
    "( note that at @xmath31 cm the virial temperature is already @xmath36 kev , in principle sufficient for the formation of a hard power law ) .",
    "however , a similar adaf flow picture can not apply to the atoll sources .",
    "these sources can not have such a high accretion rate , since they have no way of hiding the corresponding photon luminosity liberated near the neutron star surface .",
    "the energetics is a problem for disk configurations where the losses from comptonization are expected to exceed the energy locally available from gravitational release or radiative heating ( shibazaki et al .",
    "kht97 suggest that the comptonizing region is a quasi - spherical flow preheated by radiation from a central region ( references in kht97 , zeldovich & shakura 1969 ) , perhaps a hot boundary region ( titarchuk , lapidus & muslimov 1998 ) . transporting a large fraction of energy to large radii",
    "may also be accomplished by a wind blown from the inner disk ( achterberg 1998 ) .",
    "magnetic fields offer another possibility for transporting energy from near the compact star to larger radial distances ( stone et al .",
    "1996 ) . to maintain the comptonizing region in the neutron star systems a large fraction ( at least 25% ) of the total accretion power must be efficiently transported from its point of release , within a few tens of km of the neutron star , out to distances of order @xmath37 cm .    to summarize , we have shown that the phase delays and coherences measured in neutron stars are the same in x - ray binaries which likely contain black holes .",
    "if these lags are from comptonization , the size of the scattering medium is large which may pose a problem for the energetics .",
    "delays generated by processes other than comptonization may have to be considered as has been done recently ( bottcher & liang 1998 ) .",
    "the correct model must describe both accretion onto black holes and neutron stars .",
