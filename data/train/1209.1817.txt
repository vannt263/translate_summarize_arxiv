    "<S> we present a next - to - leading logarithmic resummation for the jet - veto efficiency in higgs production . </S>",
    "<S> we then discuss how this prediction affects the theoretical uncertainties in the region of transverse momenta of interest for higgs searches at the lhc .    in searches of a standard model higgs boson decaying into a pair of @xmath0 bosons , it is customary to divide events with the requested signature into bins corresponding to different jet multiplicities  @xcite . in particular , we concentrate on the 0-jet cross section , obtained by requiring that there are no jets with transverse momentum @xmath1 larger than @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this 0-jet bin turns out to be less contaminated by @xmath0 s originated from top - antitop production .    </S>",
    "<S> the 0-jet cross section can be computed at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) thanks to the fully differential calculations for higgs production of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the question then arises on how to estimate the theoretical uncertainties of the 0-jet cross section . </S>",
    "<S> it was already observed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that simultaneous variation of renormalisation and factorisation scales leads to underestimating theoretical uncertainties , which even vanish for @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the authors of that paper propose a more sophisticated way to asses uncertainties based on those of the inclusive cross section . </S>",
    "<S> the authors of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite argued further that the small scale uncertainty in the 0-jet cross section was due to cancellations between two effects of different physical origin . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> while the inclusive cross section @xmath5 is affected by a large @xmath6-factor , the one for having more than one jet @xmath7 contains logarithmically enhanced contributions @xmath8 , with @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> since these two effects are uncorrelated , they propose to estimate the uncertainties on @xmath10 by just adding in quadrature the uncertainties on @xmath5 and @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> we elaborate further on this ideas and write the 0-jet cross section as the product of @xmath5 and the jet - veto efficiency @xmath12 , defined as the fraction of events such that all jets have a transverse momentum less than @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the knowledge of higher and higher orders for @xmath5 does not help in reducing the uncertainty in @xmath12 , which rather reflects our ignorance about logarithms @xmath8 of sudakov origin , arising from a veto condition on real radiation . in the following we then consider the uncertainties on @xmath14 and @xmath12 as uncorrelated and we concentrate on the efficiency only  @xcite .    at fixed order , </S>",
    "<S> the efficiency is defined in terms of the following cross sections : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are of relative order @xmath18 with respect to the born cross section @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> it is also useful to introduce the `` complementary '' cross sections @xmath20 as follows @xmath21 we remark that at the moment the perturbative expansion of these cross section is known up to relative order @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> we now identify three schemes that we believe cover the possibilities to construct a jet - veto efficiency starting from the above cross sections : @xmath23 we observe that all these prescriptions differ only at order @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> each of them has its own meaning . </S>",
    "<S> scheme  ( a ) is the naive definition of the efficiency as the ratio between the 0-jet cross section and the inclusive cross section . </S>",
    "<S> scheme  ( b ) can be motivated by the fact that the jet - veto efficiency can be seen as one minus the probability of having one jet with @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> this gives , at present accuracy , @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , scheme  ( c ) corresponds to the strict fixed order expansion of the efficiency .    in the following we use these three schemes as an extra handle , besides renormalisation and factorisation scale variations , to quantify the uncertainties on the jet - veto efficiency . indeed , if we compute @xmath12 for the three schemes , we obtain very different predictions . </S>",
    "<S> namely , including also independent variation of renormalisation and factorisation scale in the range @xmath27 with @xmath28 , in the region of interest for experimental studies ( @xmath29 for atlas and @xmath30 ) for cms , the spread in fixed - order predictions for the jet - veto efficiency is around 30%  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is not observed in z production , where all three schemes basically coincide .    since part of this bad convergence </S>",
    "<S> can be attributed to the presence of large logarithms of soft - collinear origin , it is useful to see how the uncertainty changes when performing an all - order resummation of such logarithms . at next - to - </S>",
    "<S> next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) accuracy , which amounts in controlling all terms @xmath31 in @xmath32 , this is possible with the automated resummation program caesar  @xcite . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> if jets are to be found everywhere in rapidity , caesar tells us that the jet - veto efficiency is resummable within nll accuracy , and has the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the gluon - gluon luminosity , evaluated at the factorisation scale @xmath13 , and @xmath35 is the sudakov exponent @xmath36\\,,\\quad \\beta_0= \\frac{11 c_a - 4 t_r n_f}{12 \\pi}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the physical coupling of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . while @xmath35 contains virtual corrections only , the function @xmath38 accounts for multiple soft - collinear real emissions . for a perfectly factorisable observable @xmath39 we have @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that , for small @xmath13 , if jets are defined with a @xmath41-algorithm ( anti-@xmath42 , cambridge - aachen , @xmath42 ) , for emissions widely separated in rapidity no recombination can occur . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is only the hardest gluon that contributes to the jet - veto efficiency , and therefore @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> a resummed prediction as the one in eq .   </S>",
    "<S> contains an extra source of theoretical uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> indeed one can decide to resum @xmath43 instead of @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is an arbitrary `` resummation '' scale we choose to vary in the range @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , to be able to present resummed predictions for the jet - veto efficiency , we have to match the efficiency in eq .   with its expression at order @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we introduce three matching schemes , defined in such a way that for @xmath47 the matched efficiency reduces to the expression in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:4 ] ) , whilst for @xmath48 , it approaches its fixed order expression in any of the three schemes introduced in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the matching scheme gives us then an extra handle to estimate theoretical uncertainties .     </S>",
    "<S> ( nnlo ) and matched to nll resummation ( nll+nnlo ) . </S>",
    "<S> right : nll+nnlo efficiency compared to powheg rescaled using hqt.,title=\"fig : \" ]   ( nnlo ) and matched to nll resummation ( nll+nnlo ) . </S>",
    "<S> right : nll+nnlo efficiency compared to powheg rescaled using hqt.,title=\"fig : \" ]    we now present results for the matched jet - veto efficiency , at the lhc with @xmath49 tev , with jets clustered using the anti-@xmath42 algorithm with @xmath50 , and for @xmath51 gev . </S>",
    "<S> i order to estimate theoretical uncertainties , we identify a `` central '' prediction , the efficiency computed with matching scheme  ( a ) and with all scales @xmath52 equal to @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> we then vary one scale at a time for scheme  ( a ) in the range @xmath54 $ ] , and vary the matching schemes using @xmath55 . in this way we believe we do not double count uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> the predictions corresponding to this choice are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : eps - nll ] . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that nll resummation helps reducing the uncertainties in the jet - veto efficency . indeed , for @xmath13 between 25 and 30 gev , they move from 20% ( pure nnlo ) down to 10% ( nll+nnlo ) . </S>",
    "<S> this improvement is not as huge , as is for lower values of @xmath13 , and reflects the fact that in this intermediate region @xmath56 is not large enough to guarantee that resummation effects dominate . </S>",
    "<S> we notice also that here the uncertainty is dominated by the difference between matching schemes . </S>",
    "<S> since this difference is formally nnnll , we do not expect that a nnll resummation could considerably help reducing the theoretical uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we compare our predictions with the monte carlo event generator that is currently used by cms and atlas to estimate the jet - veto efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> this is powheg  @xcite interfaced to pythia  @xcite , rescaled in such a way that it agrees with the higgs @xmath1 spectrum computed at nnll+nnlo accuracy with the program hqt  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainties in powheg+pythia are estimated by following the recommendation of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , i.e.  varying renormalisation and factorisation scales independently around @xmath53 and fixing the parameter ` hfact ` to @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe good agreement between our nll+nnlo and powheg+pythia in the region of @xmath13 of interest . </S>",
    "<S> however , at lower values of @xmath2 , we find that nll+nnlo predictions tend to give lower efficiency than that obtained with powheg+pythia . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that the same trend is observed when comparing nll+nllo to predictions obtained with other monte carlo event generators .    to conclude , </S>",
    "<S> we have investigated how a nll resummation for the jet - veto efficiency affects the theoretical uncertainty on this quantity . </S>",
    "<S> it would be very interesting to see how these findings change after a nnll resummation . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we have computed ( for @xmath58 ) the part of nnll resummation that depends on the jet radius . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining nnll contributions could be obtained by relating the jet - veto efficiency to the higgs @xmath1 spectrum ( see for instance  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we hope to complete this study soon .    * note added . * </S>",
    "<S> the nnll resummation for the jet - veto efficiency in higgs and drell - yan production has been recently completed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>"
