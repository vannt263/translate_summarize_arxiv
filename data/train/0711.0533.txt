    "the rare - earth nickel borocarbides ( rni@xmath0b@xmath7c where r is a rare - earth element ) have attracted considerable interest in the last decade because of their unique superconducting and/or magnetic properties ( see reviews @xcite ) .",
    "the crystal structure of rni@xmath0b@xmath7c is a body - centered tetragonal with space group @xmath8 @xcite , a layered structure in which ni@xmath7b@xmath7 layers are separated by r - c planes stacked along the @xmath3-axis .",
    "the r ions are situated at the corners and in the center of the crystal unit cell . conducting ( and superconducting ) properties",
    "are determined mainly by ni @xmath9 electrons , while magnetic properties are dictated by localized electrons in the r @xmath10-shell .",
    "long - range magnetic order is thought to result from the indirect rkky interaction , mediated through conducting electrons .",
    "this gives rise to different types of antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order of the @xmath10-ions at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "borocarbides with r = tm , er , ho , dy show coexistence of superconductivity and long - range magnetic order .",
    "although the borocarbides were studied quite intensively , certain important issues remain open .",
    "we report a torque magnetometry study of metamagnetic transitions at low temperature ( @xmath11 k ) in a single - crystal magnetic superconductor honi@xmath0b@xmath7c .",
    "torque magnetometry is sensitive only to the component of the magnetization normal to both the applied field and the torque and is thus useful in the study of magnetic anisotropy .",
    "the choice of the subject was determined by its interesting magnetic properties , which can not be considered as fully understood to date , and by the circumstance , that torque magnetometry was applied to the borocarbides so far only in limited cases @xcite .",
    "the magnetic properties of honi@xmath0b@xmath7c , a superconductor with critical temperature t@xmath12  k , are characterized by ( _ i _ ) large anisotropy and ( _ ii _ ) availability of different field - induced magnetic phases at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "three magnetic transitions occur in a narrow temperature interval , when moving from the paramagnetic state in low field below @xmath13 k. the first two transitions ( at 6.0 k and 5.5 k ) result in two incommensurate afm phases , described in detail in @xcite .",
    "below @xmath14  k , the transition to a commensurate afm phase occurs .",
    "this afm phase is a @xmath3-axis modulated magnetic structure consisting of ho - moments ferromagnetically aligned in the tetragonal basal @xmath15 planes along the [ 110 ] axis and stacked antiferromagnetically in the @xmath3-direction .",
    "the easy magnetic axis [ 110 ] was found experimentally and supported by theory @xcite . in a tetragonal lattice four equivalent easy directions @xmath16 are expected .",
    "the four @xmath17 axes are hard directions .",
    "no appreciable magnetization was found in the direction perpendicular to the @xmath4-planes ( along the @xmath3-axis ) in fields up to 6  t @xcite , so it is commonly assumed that the ho magnetic moments always lie in the @xmath4-planes roughly parallel to one of the @xmath16 axes .",
    "in the temperature range below @xmath1 4 k , several metamagnetic transitions ( of first order ) were found , depending on the magnitude of the magnetic field applied parallel to the @xmath4-planes and the angle @xmath2 between the field and the nearest easy axis @xmath16 . below a critical field @xmath18 ,",
    "the commensurate afm phase , characterized by alternating ferromagnetically ordered @xmath4-planes with the ho moments in neighboring planes in opposite directions , is stable .",
    "this phase can be symbolized by ( @xmath19 ) @xcite , which means that the ho moments are parallel to one of the easy directions ( say , [ 110 ] ) in one half of the @xmath4 planes and parallel to the opposite direction ( that is , to 110 ) in the other half .    with increasing field , at @xmath20 a transition to a collinear",
    "ferrimagnetic phase takes place .",
    "this phase can be symbolized as ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "spins in two thirds of the @xmath4-planes are parallel to one easy axis , while those in the remaining one third are antiparallel .",
    "it yields one third of the maximum possible magnetization that the ho ions can provide .",
    "the next metamagnetic transition at higher field @xmath22 results in the non - collinear phase ( @xmath23 ) @xcite .",
    "it was assumed in the existing theories @xcite in this case that two thirds of the spins are parallel to one of the easy axes ( as in the preceding ferrimagnetic phase ) , but the remaining one third is perpendicular to that axis . in this model",
    "the net magnetization is thus predicted to make an angle @xmath24 with the easy axis .",
    "the nature of this non - collinear phase turns out to be , however , not so simple @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the models @xcite assume a magnetic structure modulated along the @xmath3-axis ( @xmath25  @xmath26 ) ; whereas , neutron diffraction studies show that this phase is modulated along the @xmath27-axis ( @xmath28  @xmath29 ) @xcite .",
    "finally , at the field @xmath30 , a transition to the ( @xmath31 ) phase , the saturated paramagnetic state in which the spins are aligned ferromagnetically parallel to the @xmath16 axis nearest to the direction of the applied field , occurs . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , if the field is directed along or rather close to a @xmath16 axis , within the angular region @xmath32 , the ( @xmath19)(@xmath21)(@xmath31 ) sequence of transitions takes place . for larger @xmath2 ( outside this range , greater than @xmath33 and less than @xmath34 from the same @xmath16 axis ) the whole sequence of possible transitions [ ( @xmath19)(@xmath21)(@xmath23)(@xmath31 ) ]",
    "would be observed .",
    "the suggested @xmath35-@xmath2 diagram of metamagnetic transitions in honi@xmath0b@xmath7c at @xmath36  k based on longitudinal magnetization measurements @xcite is shown by the solid lines in fig .",
    "1 .    b@xmath7c at low temperature .",
    "symbols of different magnetic states are defined in the main text of the paper .",
    "the phase - boundary lines ( in the angular range between an easy @xmath16 and a hard @xmath37 axis ) indicated by the filled and empty squares , triangles and circles represent results of measurements at @xmath11  k ( lm and hm torque chips , respectively ) from this study .",
    "the lines a and b , formed by stars and crosses , are new boundaries of metamagnetic states revealed in this study .",
    "solid lines represent boundaries reported @xcite from longitudinal magnetization measurements at @xmath38  k. the dashed line represents the fit for data of this study to eq .",
    "( 3 ) with @xmath39 t at small @xmath2 .",
    "the data points @xmath40 is indicative of the extent of frustration in the ( @xmath41 ) ferrimagnetic state . ]",
    "since magnetic anisotropy tends to align the ho magnetic moments along the @xmath16 axis , it is clear that angular dependence of the critical fields ( @xmath18 , @xmath42 , and @xmath30 ) must be periodic with a period of @xmath43 if the four easy axes are equivalent .",
    "the angular dependences of the critical fields in the @xmath4-plane were previously studied mainly with a standard magnetometer @xcite which measures the magnetization along the applied field ( the longitudinal magnetization ) . for those studies ,",
    "the magnetic field was rotated away from an easy axis [ 110 ] in the plane perpendicular to the @xmath3-axis .",
    "measurements were taken mainly in the range @xmath44 .",
    "the results for the collinear phases [ ( @xmath19 ) , ( @xmath21 ) , ( @xmath31 ) ] were reasonably well explained by theoretical models @xcite which considered the interactions between moments in an @xmath4-plane to be only ferromagnetic .",
    "since neutron scattering @xcite shows that the non - collinear phase ( @xmath23 ) is , however , not modulated in the @xmath3-direction , that phase should be described by a much more complicated model .",
    "torque magnetometry has some distinct advantages as compared with longitudinal magnetometry in studies of magnetically anisotropic compounds like honi@xmath0b@xmath7c .",
    "a magnetometer of this type measures the torque @xmath45 , so that @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the angle between external magnetic field and magnetization .",
    "this allows precise determination of the direction of the net magnetization in each phase .",
    "when the magnetization in a material does not align with the applied magnetic field vector , the torque on the sample is actually a measure of the magnetic anisotropy energy .",
    "the torque is determined by both , magnitude and direction of the magnetization .",
    "thus , changes in magnetization direction ( or rotation of the magnetization ) at metamagnetic transitions are easily seen with torque magnetometry , but the standard longitudinal magnetometry is much less sensitive , particularly near the hard axis for this borocarbide .    three specific problems concerning low - temperature magnetic states of honi@xmath0b@xmath7c have been targeted in this study . first is the precise determination of the magnetization direction in the non - collinear phase and its dependence on magnitude of the field .",
    "the second is connected with the four possible equivalent easy direction @xmath16 axes . under these conditions , if a sample is cooled in zero field , some kind of frustrated or multidomain ( or , at least , two - domain ) state can be expected as has been pointed out in studies @xcite of the related magnetic borocarbide dyni@xmath0b@xmath7c .",
    "the third question is whether different easy @xmath16 axes are really equivalent in light of the magnetoelastic tetragonal - to - orthorhombic distortions where the unit cell is shortened about 0.19 % along the [ 110 ] direction , in which the long - range ordered ho moments are aligned @xcite as compared to its length in the perpendicular [ @xmath48 direction at low temperature ( 1.5 k ) .",
    "analysis of the torque behavior in a wide angular range of magnetic field directions can answer this question .",
    "results of this study reveal some important new features of the metamagnetic phases in honi@xmath0b@xmath7c and transitions between them , including two new phase boundaries .",
    "presentation and discussion of results proceed as follows : 1 ) the angular phase diagram of metamagnetic transitions reported here are compared with the only previous detailed study @xcite and with the main theoretical models @xcite ; 2 ) some new important peculiarities of these states and the transitions between them are discussed .",
    "the ppms model 550 torque magnetometer ( quantum design ) with piezoresistive cantilever was used in this study .",
    "the honi@xmath0b@xmath7c single crystal was grown by canfield @xcite .",
    "the crystal was carefully cut to provide a sample weighing in the range 0.10.15 mg in the form of a plate ( @xmath49 mm@xmath50 ) with the @xmath3-axis perpendicular to the plate surface and @xmath51 , @xmath52 axes parallel to the edges .",
    "the sample was mounted on the torque chip in a ppms rotator so that the torque measured was along the @xmath3-axis of the crystal . during rotation of the sample",
    "the @xmath3-axis was almost precisely perpendicular to the applied field at all times .",
    "this crystal was used previously in our studies of the magnetic phase diagram of honi@xmath0b@xmath0c @xcite .",
    "those measurements were reproduced on several different single crystals from canfield s lab .",
    "we also made torque measurements at representative fields and angles on another sample cut from a single crystal from a different batch of canfield s crystals and obtained similar results .",
    "thus , we expect that the results presented here are fully representative of canfield s crystals , which seem to set the standard for work on this family of compounds .",
    "two types of the ppms torque chips are used in this study : 1 ) low moment ( lm ) ( two - leg ) chip with rms torque noise level about @xmath53 nm and maximum allowable torque about @xmath54  nm ; and 2 ) high moment ( hm ) ( three - leg ) chip with rms torque noise level about @xmath55  nm and maximum allowable torque about @xmath56  nm .",
    "the maximal applied fields for lm and hm chips were limited to 2 t and 3.5 t , respectively , to reduce breakage .",
    "it is known @xcite ( but usually not taken into account ) that at large torque the orientation change of the sample due to twisting of the cantilever itself is no longer negligible .",
    "this can cause an error in angular position of the high - field metamagnetic transitions .",
    "the angular coefficient factor for a silicon piezoresistive cantilever of microscopic size ( about 0.2  mm in width ) can be about @xmath57 nm @xcite . for the hm chip of the ppms device this coefficient is about @xmath58 nm @xcite .",
    "thus , for higher torque ( @xmath59  nm ) the angular error for critical fields due to twisting of the cantilever can be several degrees .",
    "it is also evident that twisting of the cantilever can induce apparent angular asymmetry of metamagnetic transitions for high magnitudes of field and torque .",
    "we have observed this effect for the critical field @xmath30 , but this asymmetry appears to be rather small ( about @xmath60 ) even for the highest fields and torques in this study .",
    "in addition to the error due to twisting of the cantilever , another important contribution to total error is non - linearity , when the torque is rather close to the maximum allowable value .",
    "this can cause underestimation of the measured torque ( and magnetization ) and , thus , the magnitude of the critical field @xmath61 .",
    "this particular error should be higher for the lm chip in comparison to the hm chip . in this study",
    "both the lm and hm chips gave practically the same numerical results for the torque and angular dependence of the metamagnetic transitions below 1.5 t ( this field region includes the first two metamagnetic transitions for any angular position of the field , and the third transition to a saturated paramagnetic ( @xmath31 ) phase for angular positions not too far from the easy axis ) .",
    "for the higher field range ( 1.52.0 t ) , however , the hm chip gave systematically higher values of the measured torque than the lm chip .",
    "the difference increases with field , so that at @xmath62  t the ratio of the torque values measured by the hm and lm chips is about 1.5 .",
    "it is clear that above 1.5 t ( where the torque was close to or even larger than @xmath63  nm ) the hm chip measures more precisely than the lm one .",
    "in general , we believe that the results of this study obtained below 1.5 t can be considered as reliable with accuracy for the angle values for magnetic transitions being about @xmath64 . for higher field , @xmath65  t , where the torque of the sample was close to maximum allowable values , the precision is far less . for precise measurements in higher fields , a sample with smaller mass ( and dimensions ) should be used , but we were not able to prepare and orient a significantly smaller sample . although the sample studied was mounted carefully with the @xmath3-axis perpendicular to the applied field , some misalignment can not be excluded .",
    "it is estimated that this tilting is no more than @xmath66 , which would produce less than a 1 % error in the measured magnitudes of the critical fields of the metamagnetic transitions . for samples with smaller dimensions",
    "this error can be far larger .",
    "we have estimated demagnetization fields to be no more than 30 - 40 mt at the highest fields which would affect the accuracy of angular measurements of at most @xmath67 .",
    "torque measurements were made by changing the magnetic field for different constant angles and by sweeping the angle for different fixed values of magnetic field at one temperature @xmath1 1.9 k only .",
    "during discussion of the results obtained , the angular position of the applied magnetic field will be described by different but related angles shown in fig .",
    "the first is the angle , @xmath68 , the rotator position of the torque magnetometer .",
    "the second is the angle @xmath2 between the applied field and the nearest easy axis @xmath16 . in some cases it is more convenient to use the angle @xmath6 between the field and the nearest hard axis @xmath17 . finally , the angle @xmath47 between the external magnetic field and the magnetization ( which does not coincide with angle @xmath2 for some metamagnetic phases studied ) is also very important for understanding the torque results .",
    "the applied field @xmath69 lies along the @xmath37 crystal axis . the sample is rotated @xmath68 ( indicated by the ppms rotator ) with the field remaining fixed .",
    "the angle @xmath2 is between the nearest @xmath16 crystal axis ( easy axis ) and the applied field , and @xmath6 is the angle between the nearest @xmath70 crystal axis ( hard axis ) .",
    "the angle between @xmath71 and @xmath69 is @xmath47 . ]",
    "after the sample is mounted in the torque magnetometer , the easy axes @xmath16 ( or hard axes @xmath17 ) in terms of the angular position of the rotator , @xmath68 , are initially known only approximately ( within a few degrees ) .",
    "but their location is determined rather precisely from measured angular dependences of the torque , which are found to be periodic to a good approximation with a period of @xmath43 , as expected .",
    "the angles @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 correspond within one degree accuracy to the @xmath75 easy axes .",
    "similarly , @xmath76 , @xmath43 , and @xmath77 correspond to @xmath17 hard axes .",
    "the angular dependences of the critical fields for all metamagnetic transitions found in this study are summarized in fig .",
    "3 for the whole angular range studied .",
    "they represent results obtained from the field dependence of the torque recorded for different angles and angular dependence of the torque recorded for different fields ( see examples in figs .",
    "4 and 5 ) .",
    "the transitions manifest themselves as sharp changes or even jumps of the torque at the critical fields or angles . the critical fields ( @xmath18 , @xmath42 , and @xmath30 ) for a given angle are defined by the inflection point in the corresponding @xmath78 transition curves with increasing applied magnetic field ( fig .",
    "angles of the transitions for different applied fields are defined in a similar way ( fig .",
    "the first ( @xmath19)(@xmath21 ) ( afm  ferrimagnetic ) transition manifests itself clearly for all angles , as do other transitions ( see figs . 4 and 5 ) .",
    "for angles rather close to the easy @xmath16 or hard @xmath17 axes some of the metamagnetic transitions show specific unusual features outlined further below .",
    "the first transition has considerable hysteresis ( fig.4 ) . for the other two transitions ,",
    "the field hysteresis is small .",
    "some angular hysteresis is also observed when measuring for increasing and decreasing angle ( fig .",
    "5 ) . for the most part ,",
    "this hysteresis is not large ( 11.5 degree ) and is isotropic .",
    "we believe that it is mainly due to the backlash in the rotator . for the angular positions of the field near the hard axis we found an increased angular hysteresis ( up to @xmath79 ) . for this reason ,",
    "critical angles of the metamagnetic transitions recorded for fixed values of the magnetic field were determined for increasing angle . for some angles the transitions at @xmath42 , ( @xmath21)(@xmath23 ) , and at @xmath30 , ( @xmath23)(@xmath31 ) ,",
    "show a change of sign of the torque ( fig .",
    "4 ) , which clearly indicates a change of direction of the net magnetization from one side of the applied field to the other .",
    "the phase - boundary lines determined in this study are compared ( fig .",
    "1 ) with the phase diagram determined from longitudinal magnetization measurements @xcite .    in order to compare the first two transitions with previous measurements , they are presented in fig . 6 on an enlarged scale .",
    "the first ( @xmath19)(@xmath21 ) metamagnetic transition is described well by the angular relation @xmath80 [ with @xmath81  t ] , shown by the solid curve in fig .",
    "6 ( see also the corresponding straight phase - boundary line in fig",
    "this is consistent with that found from measurements of the longitudinal magnetization for increasing field @xcite , except that @xmath82  t in @xcite , which was fitted with theoretical models @xcite .",
    "a pronounced hysteresis is found for this transition ( fig .",
    "4 ) with @xmath18 obtained for decreasing field about 0.04  t below that for increasing field .",
    "this angular dependence ( 1 ) is understood in terms of the ho moments remaining aligned along the [ 110 ] axis when the magnetic field is rotated from it in the @xmath4-plane , as long as the angle of rotation does not exceed @xmath34 .",
    "thus , only the projection of the field on the [ 110 ] axis is important ( see the phase diagram in fig .  1 ) .",

    "this takes place approximately in the range @xmath154 .",
    "outside these regions , @xmath153 is approximately constant as expected for the ( @xmath21 ) phase .",

    "it is significant that deviation of torque behavior from that expected ( in line with models @xcite ) for the non - collinear phase begins well away from @xmath150 ( fig .",
    "so it appears that , in some substantial angular range around the hard axis , the metamagnetic state of the sample is different from the non - collinear phase described in models @xcite . due to the radical change in angular behavior of the torque at the angle",
    "@xmath162 we can consider this point as an indication of a new metamagnetic transition from the non - collinear ( @xmath23 ) phase to a different phase which we will call the intermediate state .",

    "1 which is parallel to the dashed straight line of the ( @xmath23)-(@xmath31 ) transition plotted according to models @xcite . therefore ,",
    "the critical field @xmath84 , defined by line a in fig . 1 , has the same @xmath168 angular dependence as that given by eq .",

    ". it can be suggested , therefore , that figure 12 shows the following sequence of transitions with increasing @xmath2 from 0 to @xmath34 : ( @xmath31)(@xmath23)(intermediate state)(border state ) . according to the phase diagram in fig .  1 , this sequence of transitions should take place for any field above @xmath175 t ( but , of course , with other critical angles )",
    "indeed , @xmath162 and @xmath163 can be seen in figs .  5 and 9 , too .",
    "the occurrence of the intermediate phase was found at first by means of examination of angular dependences of torque like those shown in figs . 5 , 9 and 12 . the resulting phase diagram ( fig .",
    "1 ) implies , however , that this phase should manifest itself in experimental @xmath176 curves as well for some rather narrow angular range which was estimated to be @xmath177 . within this range the following sequence of metamagnetic transitions",

    "both these cases are apparent in fig .",
    "8 . in the upper panel",
    ", @xmath105 is presented for angle @xmath179 ( which is equivalent to @xmath180 due to the angular symmetry ) .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath105 at a constant angle @xmath2 is equal to the normal component of the magnetization .",
    "it is seen that when transition with critical field @xmath121 is completed for high enough field , the magnetization is nearly constant for @xmath181 ; whereas , for @xmath112 , the magnetization first increases with increasing field and only for a higher field the magnetization appears to come to a saturated value .",
    "this is where the transition between the intermediate and the non - collinear phases is expected according to the line a in fig .",
    "1 . this transition manifests itself more clearly for higher angles @xmath2 ( not shown ) .",
    "we have defined the transition lines a and b in fig . 1 based on distinct features in the torque _ vs. _ @xmath2 curves at constant field , but there is uncertainty in the exact part of the feature that represents the transition .",
    "the experimental angular uncertainty is also more important in this small angular range .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath172 dependence for @xmath182 in figs . 1 and 3 is quite precise , though the `` actual '' transition could be shifted parallel to the hard axis slightly in fig .",
    "1 . based on the arguments used by canfield et al .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath172 dependence implies that the change in magnetization @xmath183 at these boundaries ( lines a and b ) is normal to the nearest hard axis from the field direction .",
    "thus @xmath184 where @xmath185 is the change in torque at the boundary a. with @xmath185 from torque _ vs. _ @xmath68 data at fixed @xmath186  t and 1.4  t ( not shown , but like that shown in fig . 9 for @xmath187 and 1.2 t and fig . 12 for @xmath139",

    ", this @xmath191 corresponds very roughly to flipping one ho@xmath192 moment in 6 of those aligned along the nearest easy axis to the applied field @xmath193 to the perpendicular easy axis in going from the non - collinear phase ( @xmath23 ) to the intermediate state .",
    "although the error is much larger since the b line can be intercepted only with @xmath193 less than @xmath194 from the hard axis , a similar estimate indicates very roughly that an additional 2 in 9 ho@xmath192 moments originally along the dominant easy axis are flipped @xmath43 in going from the intermediate state to the border state .    can the available neutron scattering data for honi@xmath0b@xmath7c @xcite clarify the new results of this torque study , concerning new phase boundaries revealed and `` frustration '' behavior near a hard axis ? data by detlefs , et al .",
    "@xcite at @xmath195 to the easy axis shows the @xmath28  @xmath29 modulation vector in the region of the ( @xmath23 ) phase in fig .  3 while that by campbell , et al .",
    "@xcite along the hard axis in the region of the border phase shows a @xmath196  @xmath29 modulation vector .",
    "measurements by schneider @xcite with increasing field along the hard axis ( in the @xmath197-direction ) at 2 k indicate the presence of a @xmath198  @xmath29 propagation vector in the ferrimagnetic phase which switches over to a 0.62  @xmath197 propagation vector ( parallel to the applied field ) in coexistence with a weaker 0.60 @xmath197 modulation in the region of our `` border '' phase .",
    "he suggests , based on the argument @xcite that the @xmath29 , @xmath197 modulations may only develop from non - collinear phases , that the 0.58  @xmath29 modulation in the ferrimagnetic phase region may be associated with the c6 non - collinear phase @xmath199 predicted by amici and thalmeier @xcite .",
    "we note that this phase with magnetization along the hard axis might possibly develop in the very narrow frustration region near the hard axis in the ferrimagnetic phase ( see fig .",
    "11 ) , but we did not see any evidence of a phase boundary in the entire ferrimagnetic region corresponding to that predicted for c6 @xcite , and the torque measurements outside of the frustration region were completely consistent with the ( @xmath23 ) phase , as were longitudinal magnetization measurements @xcite .",
    "we note that the boundary between our `` intermediate '' phase and the non - collinear phase is in the general vicinity of the f2 phase ( @xmath200 ) predicted by amici and thalmeier @xcite , but the field - angle dependence is quite different .",
    "we can only speculate that the @xmath197-modulations observed by schneider may be related to the `` border '' and `` intermediate '' phases observed here .",
    "it is also possible that the `` frustration '' behavior results from a two - domain state when two possible directions of orthorhombic distortions are realized simultaneously when the field is directed close enough to the hard axis ( so that there is some mixed state around the hard axis rather than a single phase ) .",
    "the magnetization that determines the torque is the total magnetization which , in that scenario , can lie close to @xmath150 , though the ho moments lie only along easy directions locally .",
    "we have found , that in these two new ( intermediate and border ) phases , the net magnetization appears to rotate in steps toward the hard axis as the applied field is rotated toward that direction , suggesting that they may both be states consisting of mixture of two or more phases in a ratio that changes with applied field .",
    "the discovery of `` frustration '' in the magnetic phases of honi@xmath0b@xmath7c for the field direction along the hard axis @xmath17 is an important new result of the present study .",
    "the new phenomena found in this study raises the question : why were they not revealed in the longitudinal magnetization measurements @xcite ?",
    "obvious reasons may be insensitivity to the component of @xmath71 normal to the field and the rather large error bars for orientation of the field in the @xmath4-plane of honi@xmath0b@xmath7c crystal lattice , which in ref .",
    "@xcite were about @xmath201 . in the present study",
    "this error is far less ( @xmath64 ) , but the main advantages of torque magnetometry are that the relative angular accuracy ( when rotating a sample consistently in only one direction ) is very high and that it is very sensitive to the normal component of @xmath71 which is subject to fluctuations near @xmath150 . the data obtained show quite consistent , not random changes in the torque magnitude for angle variations about 0.25@xmath202 or even less . as a result , the angular torque dependences consist of hundreds of points that allow detection of important features of the torque angular behavior .",
    "these torque measurements provide not only a check of the known results and refinement of the angular diagram for metamagnetic transitions in honi@xmath0b@xmath7c , but also clarify some important features of these metamagnetic states and , moreover , indicate new states .",
    "indications of a magnetically inhomogeneous state of the afm phase at low magnetic field , which is likely determined by a combined influence of multidomain magnetic structure and flux trapping in the superconducting state were found .",
    "the first precise determination of the magnetization direction in the ( @xmath23 ) phase was made .",
    "this direction varies with the magnitude of the applied field which does not agree with model predictions @xcite .",
    "two new phase boundaries parallel to the hard axis in the @xmath4-plane polar field plot ( fig .",
    "1 ) were indicated in a region previously ascribed to the non - collinear ( @xmath29 or @xmath197 modulated ) phase .",
    "`` frustration '' was observed when the direction of magnetic field is close to the hard axis @xmath70 ( @xmath32 ) and tentatively explained by a mixed ( two - domain ) state of the system with moments aligned along different equivalent easy axes .",
