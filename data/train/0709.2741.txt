    "the study of vacuum properties and decay is a fascinating subject , and it becomes even more interesting when its interplay with gravitation is considered . a natural context",
    "to study properties of vacuum is early universe cosmology , where vacuum energy density plays a dominant role .",
    "for this reason , early after the first studies of vacuum and vacuum decay @xcite , gravity entered the scene @xcite : in most models thin relativistic shells are used to describe the dynamics of vacuum bubbles .",
    "classical models already reveal interesting properties , but they tend to be affected by issues , in connection with stability and the presence of singularities . to avoid these problems , quantum models ( mostly semiclassical )",
    "have been developed @xcite : vacuum decay is then described in the wkb approximation as spacetime tunnelling driven by the thin shell . despite the earliest of these works date back to more than 30 years ago , issues left open in the original formulation @xcite have not yet been solved @xcite . here",
    "we review some of these issues from a general perspective .",
    "we also point out that , although the existing literature mostly focuses on applications relevant for early universe cosmology , the open problems are of a more general nature and can be recognized as a general difficulty in the semiclassical quantization of the ( general relativistic ) shell system . after a preliminary review of some background material in sec.@xmath0[sec : predef ] , we prove in sec.@xmath0[sec : genres ] a collection of general properties of shell dynamics in spherically symmetric , but otherwise arbitrary , configurations . then , in sec.@xmath0[sec : tunpro ] , we present in the perspective of these results some issues related with the wkb description of the tunnelling process ; a concluding discussion follows in sec.@xmath0[sec : dissec ] . apart from the included bibliography , additional references can be also found in @xcite .",
    "throughout the paper curvature conventions follow @xcite , with greek indices taking the values @xmath1 , lowercase latin indices taking the values @xmath2 , and uppercase latin indices the values @xmath3 .",
    "we consider two parts @xmath4 and @xmath5 of two spacetimes and assume that they have a common timelike part @xmath6 in their boundaries .",
    "various quantities related to the submanifolds @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are defined in the table below and in fig.@xmath0[fig : geoquadef ] , panel [ a ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in both diagrams , at @xmath7 in panel [ a ] and at @xmath8 in panel [ b ] , the normal to the shell become non - transverse to the constant @xmath9 surfaces . at these points",
    "the corresponding signs @xmath10 vanish and the momentum develops a discontinuity , as shown in panel [ c ] .",
    "it is non trivial to build the junction and we face again a double covering with inverted normal direction in the schwarzschild patch during the evolution of the initial slice ( i ) into the final one ( f ) .",
    "concerning the last two cases , we notice , as we did at the end of the proof of prop.@xmath0[prop : euceffmomdef ] , that , in view of the form of the effective momentum @xmath11 , it is certainly possible to choose appropriate branches of the inverse tangent functions to _ cure _ the discontinuity : nevertheless , this spoils the vanishing of the momentum at one of the turning points .",
    "it would , moreover , be interesting , to understand these possibilities in connection with the structure of the euclidean spacetime diagram .",
    "remembering the results presented in sec.@xmath0[sec : genres ] , we would like to point out that the problems discussed in the previous section under very specific settings , are in fact general ones . in our opinion",
    "this fact has not yet been properly recognized .",
    "we would also like to make clear that , although the problems with the effective momentum _ could _ be solved by arguing that it is the effective theory that has intrinsic limits , _ we think that this partial solution would be rather unsatisfactory_. the main point we are trying to make here is that the problems of the effective formulation are _ closely tied _ to the geometric properties of the euclidean solution to the junction condition and to the _ euclidean structure of the spacetime patches _ that participate in the junction .",
    "moreover , the difficulties described above _ can _ be absent , and _ when they are absent _ , perfectly consistent results are obtained . in this respect , it becomes even more suggestive to draw the following picture .",
    "the idea of bubbles / shells tunnelling has been originally developed to overcome some weak points in the description provided by purely classical models of vacuum bubbles using general relativistic shells : in particular , the problem of initial singularity , i.e. the fact that exponentially expanding solutions giving rise to a baby universe , classically , have a singularity in their past . tunnelling ( i.e. the use of quantum effects ) solves this issue :",
    "in fact , we can start with a solution regular in the past ( the bounded solution , which classically would never grow enough ) and have it tunnel into an infinitely expanding one ( the unbounded / bounce solution ) which has the late time behavior we are interested in , but can not exist at early times .",
    "we are , thus _ using quantum effects to circumvent the consequences of classical singularity theorems_. the same idea has been employed also in a logically opposite direction using different spacetimes to build up the junction : then the reversed tunnelling process can describe a collapsing shell of matter @xcite , which classically doomed to crash in a future singularity , is , instead , saved by quantum effects , again avoiding the fate prescribed by classical singularity theorems .",
    "another fact which has not yet been appreciated is that , in view of the simple but general results of sec.@xmath0[sec : genres ] , this kind of processes is affected by the same difficulties , again related to a hard to interpret behavior in the euclidean sector . in this sense the more general formulation of the problems shown in figs.@xmath0[fig : firtuncas ] and [ fig : sectuncas ] , that can be obtained in terms of the results of sec.@xmath0[sec : genres ] , shows that they are _ very general issues which appear when we try to use semiclassical quantum effects to circumvent the consequences of classical singularity theorems_. as we said , this issues are not restricted to applications to the cosmological ( baby - universes ) scenario , as it is often believed , but represent instead another manifestation of the intrinsic difficulty in the interplay between the properties of general relativity and those of quantum theory .",
    "it seems to us a great opportunity , given to us by the intuitive and beautiful geometric character of israel junction conditions , that these issues can appear at a technically rather simple level , offering us the possibility to concentrate our attention on their physical / geometric significance .",
    "this study is still work in progress , which at present is focused on finding general geometric criteria i ) to identify the appearance of the above issues in the junction tunnelling process and ii ) to characterize the difficulties in the euclidean sector in terms of intuitive properties of the effective theory .",
    "additional results will be reported ( hopefully soon ) elsewhere .",
    "the author would like to thank a. guth for some stimulating discussion on the subject of this work , which is partly supported by an invitation fellowship of the _ japan society for the promotion of science _ and has been partly supported by a grant of the _ fulbright commission_.    99 s. coleman , _ phys .",
