    "coherent structures in a turbulent convection at large rayleigh numbers have been observed in the atmospheric turbulent convection @xcite ( so - called  semi - organized structures  ) , in numerous laboratory experiments in the rayleigh - bnard apparatus @xcite ( so - called  wind  or  mean wind  ) and in direct numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "characteristic spatial and time scales of the coherent structures in a turbulent convection are larger than turbulent scales .    in spite of numerous theoretical , experimental and numerical studies of coherent structures in turbulent convection ,",
    "their origin is still a subject of numerous discussions .",
    "in particular , there are two points of view on the origin of coherent structures in turbulent convection @xcite . according to one point of view",
    ", the rolls which develop at low rayleigh numbers near the onset of convection continually increase their size as rayleigh number is increased and continue to exist in an average sense at even the highest rayleigh numbers reached in the experiments @xcite .",
    "another opinion consists in that coherent structures are genuine high rayleigh number effect @xcite .",
    "a new mean - field theory of formation of coherent structures in turbulent convection has been suggested in @xcite . according to this theory a redistribution of the turbulent heat flux due to non - uniform large - scale motions plays a crucial role in the formation of the large - scale coherent structures in turbulent convection .",
    "a convective - wind instability in the shear - free turbulent convection causes the large - scale motions in the form of cells . in the sheared convection ,",
    "the large - scale instability results in an excitation of convective - shear waves , and the dominant coherent structures in the sheared convection are rolls @xcite .",
    "it was suggested on the base of laboratory experiments and numerical simulations performed in @xcite that the coherent structures in the rayleigh - bnard turbulent convection are not driven by the turbulent reynolds stresses , associated with the tilting plumes at the upper and the lower horizontal walls .",
    "the numerical results in @xcite show that once the mean flow is established , the temperature of the fluid is larger at one side wall and smaller at the other side , and the mean flow is driven by the mean buoyant force at the side walls .",
    "this is also in agreement with the experimental studies in @xcite .",
    "there is an opinion that buoyancy plays a crucial role in production of turbulent convection .",
    "for example , in the mixing length theory of astrophysical turbulent convection the following estimate for the turbulent kinetic energy is often used @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the vertical turbulent flux of entropy , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are fluctuations of fluid velocity and entropy , @xmath8 is the acceleration of gravity , @xmath9 is the characteristic correlation time of turbulent velocity field and angular brackets denote ensemble averaging .",
    "equation  ( [ a1 ] ) implies that the vertical turbulent flux of entropy plays a role of a stirring force for the turbulent convection .",
    "however , this estimate can be valid only in the absence of large - scale coherent structures .",
    "measurements of the mean temperature distributions and heat fluxes in laboratory experiments in the rayleigh - bnard turbulent convection ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) show that a thermal structure inside the large - scale circulation is inhomogeneous and anisotropic .",
    "the hot thermal plumes accumulate at one side of the large - scale circulation , and cold plumes concentrate at the opposite side of the large - scale circulation .",
    "these measurements demonstrate that the vertical turbulent heat flux inside the large - scale circulation is very small in spite of large temperature difference @xmath10 between the bottom and the top walls of the chamber . on the other hand ,",
    "the horizontal turbulent heat flux inside the large - scale circulation is larger than the vertical turbulent heat flux in spite of the absence of the imposed temperature difference @xmath11 between the side walls of the chamber ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the mean velocity field inside the large - scale circulation is strongly non - uniform and turbulence can be also produced by mean velocity shear .",
    "therefore , one may ask the question about the origin of turbulence inside the coherent structures , i.e. , is it shear - produced turbulence or buoyancy - produced turbulence ?",
    "the goal of this study is to investigate experimentally an effect of large - scale coherent structures on global properties of turbulent convection . in particular , we address the following issues : ( i ) the origin of production in turbulent convection with large - scale coherent structures ( a shear - produced or buoyancy - produced turbulence ) ; ( ii ) the scalings of global parameters ( production and dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy , turbulent velocity and integral turbulent scale , the large - scale shear , etc . ) versus the temperature difference @xmath10 between the bottom and the top walls of the chamber ; ( iii ) the degree of inhomogeneity of the turbulent convection with large - scale coherent structures .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii describes the experimental set - up for a laboratory study of the coherent structures .",
    "the experimental results and their detailed analysis are presented in section iii .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in section iv .",
    "the experiments were conducted in two rectangular chambers with dimensions @xmath12 @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xmath13 .",
    "hereafter , we use the following system of coordinates : @xmath15 is the vertical axis , the @xmath16-axis is directed along the longest wall ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the side walls of the chambers are made of transparent perspex with the thickness of @xmath17 mm .",
    "a number of experiments have been conducted with different additional thermal insulation of the side walls of the chamber in order to study whether a heat flux through the side walls affects the turbulent convective pattern .",
    "first , the side walls of the chamber were insulated with styrofoam plates with low thermal conductivity ( @xmath18 w / mk ) and with the thickness of 30 mm .",
    "two of the side plates were removed for a short time when the images of the flow were recorded . in the next series of experiments we installed additional perspex plates with a thickness of 6 mm and with an air gap of 2 mm between these plates and the outside walls of the chamber . finally , we performed experiments where these two types of thermal insulation were used simultaneously .",
    "all these experiments have shown that the heat flux through the side walls does not affect the turbulent convective pattern .     experimental set - up : ( 1 ) - walls of the chamber ;",
    "( 2 ) - cooled top with a heat exchanger ; ( 3 ) - laser light sheets ; ( 4 ) - heated bottom with a heat exchanger ; ( 5 ) - two digital ccd cameras.,width=302 ]    a vertical mean temperature gradient in the turbulent air flow was formed by attaching two aluminium heat exchangers to the bottom and top walls of the test section ( a heated bottom and a cooled top wall of the chamber ) .",
    "the thickness of the aluminium plates is 2.5 cm .",
    "the top plate is a bottom wall of the tank with cooling water .",
    "temperature of water circulating through the tank and the chiller is kept constant within @xmath19 k. cold water is pumped into the chamber through two inlets and flows out through two outlets located at the side wall of the chamber .",
    "the bottom plate is attached to the electrical heater that provides constant and uniform heating .",
    "the voltage of a stable power supply applied to the heater varies up to 200 v. the power of the heater varies up to 300 w. the temperatures of the conducting plates were measured with four thermocouples attached at the surface of each plate .",
    "the temperature difference between the top and bottom plates , @xmath10 , varies in the range from 20 k to 80 k depending on the power of the heater ( i.e. , the global rayleigh number based on molecular transport coefficients , was changed within the range of @xmath20 for the aspect ratio of the chamber @xmath21 and @xmath22 for @xmath23 ) . here",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 are the sizes of the chamber along @xmath16-axis and @xmath15-axis , respectively .",
    "the temperature in the probed region was measured with a specially designed temperature probe with twelve sensitive thermocouples having the diameter 0.125 mm .",
    "this allows us to obtain the detailed mean temperature distributions inside the coherent structures .",
    "the velocity field was measured using a digital particle image velocimetry ( piv ) , see @xcite . in the experiments we used lavision flow master iii system .",
    "a double - pulsed light sheet was provided by a nd - yag laser ( continuum surelite @xmath26 mj ) .",
    "the light sheet optics includes spherical and cylindrical galilei telescopes with tuneable divergence and adjustable focus length .",
    "we used two progressive - scan 12 bit digital ccd cameras ( with pixel size @xmath27 m @xmath28 m and @xmath29 pixels ) with a dual - frame - technique for cross - correlation processing of captured images .",
    "a programmable timing unit ( pc interface card ) generated sequences of pulses to control the laser , camera and data acquisition rate .",
    "the software package lavision davis 7 was applied to control all hardware components and for 32 bit image acquisition and visualization .",
    "this software package comprises piv software for calculating the flow fields using cross - correlation analysis .",
    "the velocity field was measured in the two perpendicular planes ( in five @xmath30 planes and in ten @xmath31 planes , so that the distance between these planes is 5 cm , see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "an incense smoke with sub - micron particles as a tracer was used for the piv measurements .",
    "smoke was produced by high temperature sublimation of solid incense particles .",
    "analysis of smoke particles using a microscope ( nikon , epiphot with an amplification of 560 ) and a pm-300 portable laser particulate analyzer showed that these particles have an approximately spherical shape and that their mean diameter is of the order of @xmath32 m .",
    "the probability density function of the particle size measured with the pm300 particulate analyzer was independent of the location in the flow for incense particle size of @xmath33 m .",
    "series of 260 pairs of images acquired with a frequency of 1 hz were stored for calculating the velocity maps and for ensemble and spatial averaging of turbulence characteristics .",
    "the center of the probed flow region coincides with the center of the chamber .",
    "we measured the velocity field in different flow areas , e.g. , in the chamber with the aspect ratio @xmath34 , the probed flow area is @xmath35 mm@xmath36 with a spatial resolution of @xmath37 m  /  pixel in @xmath30 plane , and the probed flow area is @xmath38 mm@xmath36 with a spatial resolution of @xmath39 m  /  pixel in @xmath31 plane .",
    "similarly , in the chamber with the aspect ratio @xmath1 , the probed flow area is @xmath40 mm@xmath36 with a spatial resolution of @xmath41 m  /  pixel in @xmath30 plane , and the probed flow area is @xmath42 mm@xmath36 with a spatial resolution of @xmath43 m  /  pixel in @xmath31 plane .",
    "these regions were analyzed with interrogation window of @xmath44 pixels in the chamber with the aspect ratio @xmath34 and with interrogation window of @xmath45 pixels in the chamber with the aspect ratio @xmath1 .",
    "a velocity vector was determined in every interrogation window , allowing us to construct a velocity map comprising up to @xmath46 vectors .",
    "mean and r.m.s .",
    "velocities , two - point correlation functions and integral scales of turbulence were determined from the measured velocity fields . the mean and r.m.s .",
    "velocities for each point of the velocity map ( up to 3280 points ) were determined by averaging over 260 independent maps , and then over 3280 points .",
    "the two - point longitudinal correlation functions of the velocity field were determined for the central part of the velocity map by averaging over 260 independent velocity maps . in the experiments we evaluated the variability between the fist and the last 20 frames .",
    "since no variability was found , these tests showed that 260 image pairs contain enough data to obtain reliable statistical estimates .",
    "the characteristic turbulence time in the experiments @xmath47 seconds , while the characteristic time period for the large - scale circulatory flow is by one order of magnitude larger than @xmath48 .",
    "these two characteristic times are much smaller than the time during which the velocity fields are measured .    an integral scale @xmath49 of turbulence was determined from the two - point correlation functions of the velocity field .",
    "these measurements were repeated for various temperature differences between the bottom and the top walls of the chamber .",
    "the size of the probed region did not affect our results .",
    "similar experimental set - up and data processing procedure were used in experimental study of hysteresis phenomenon in turbulent convection in @xcite and in @xcite for investigating a new phenomenon of turbulent thermal diffusion @xcite .",
    "the maximum tracer particle displacement in the experiment was of the order of @xmath50 of the interrogation window .",
    "the average displacement of tracer particles was of the order of @xmath51 pixels .",
    "the average accuracy of the velocity measurements was of the order of @xmath52 for the accuracy of the correlation peak detection in the interrogation window of the order of @xmath19 pixels ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in order to measure the vertical turbulent heat flux @xmath53 , the velocity @xmath54 and temperature @xmath55 fluctuations",
    "are determined using the temperature measurements by a thermocouple simultaneously with the velocity measurements by the piv system .",
    "a time constant of the thermocouple was evaluated experimentally as @xmath56 ms that is close to the kolmogorov s time of turbulence .",
    "the temperature is acquired in a time interval between two laser pulses used for the acquisition of every velocity vector map . during this time interval",
    "we obtain the data set consisting of about 100 measured temperatures . in order to decrease a noise level we use the mean value of this data set .",
    "simultaneous temperature and velocity measurements should be conducted at the same point in order to determine the vertical turbulent heat flux @xmath57 .",
    "since the distance between the light sheet and the thermocouple is @xmath58 mm , we have to use a correction factor @xmath59 to a measured value of the heat flux .",
    "this correction factor is obtained using the measured two - point correlation function of the velocity field .",
    "indeed , the magnitude of the longitudinal correlation function of the velocity field at the distance @xmath58 mm , is 0.95 .",
    "our velocity measurements show that the observed large - scale coherent structures comprise the one - cell and two - cell flow patterns . for instance , in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] we show the mean flow patterns obtained in the experiments with turbulent convection in the chambers with @xmath34 and @xmath1 .",
    "the prevailing observed flow pattern in the experiments in the chamber with the aspect ratio @xmath0 is one - cell flow structure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , while the prevailing observed flow pattern in the experiments in the chamber with the aspect ratio @xmath60 is two - cell flow structure ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the prevailing observed flow pattern is the flow pattern which is observed in the largest range of the rayleigh numbers .",
    "this feature is in agreement with the theoretical predictions made in @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the threshold required for the excitation of the large - scale instability that causes formation of large - scale coherent structures , is minimum when the ratio of the horizontal size to the vertical size of the large - scale circulation is approximately 2 @xcite .",
    "this value corresponds to the one - cell flow pattern in the experiments with @xmath0 , and to the two - cell flow pattern in the experiments with @xmath60 .",
    "note also that depending on the temperature difference @xmath10 between the bottom and the top walls of the chamber , we observe in the chamber with @xmath1 the two - cell flow patterns with the downward ( for @xmath61 k ) or upward ( for @xmath62 k ) motions in the central region of the chamber between two cells ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "note that the large - scale circulations in a turbulent convection have been previously experimentally studied in @xcite in a rayleigh - bnard cell with the aspect ratio @xmath63 ( with sizes @xmath64 @xmath13 ) .",
    "experiments conducted in this cell filled with water ( with prandtl number pr@xmath65 ) and at a global rayleigh number ra@xmath66 ( corresponding to a temperature difference of @xmath67 k ) , revealed that the mean flow field measured with piv comprises two rolls . this result was confirmed in our experiments for the similar aspect ratio of the chamber @xmath68 , but in air flow ( with prandtl number pr@xmath69 ) and with different horizontal cross section of the cell : rectangle in our experiments and square in the experiments reported in @xcite .",

    "the value of the constant @xmath86 was obtained for the first time in @xcite based on the experimental study @xcite for @xmath87 .    in order to determine experimentally the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate @xmath88 , we take into account a small anisotropy of the turbulent velocity field . in particular , we determine @xmath88 as follows : @xmath89 where @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath54 are the components of the turbulent velocity field ( rms ) , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the integral turbulent length scales along @xmath95 , @xmath16 and @xmath15 axis , and @xmath86 . in our experiments",
    "we determine the turbulent length scales and three components of turbulent velocity fluctuations in the range of @xmath85 from 30 to 55 , and for the temperature difference range @xmath10 between the bottom and the top walls of the chamber from 19 k to 80 k. we measure components of turbulent velocity fluctuations field in 15 planes as indicated above , and for each velocity field we determined the average values of @xmath96 over the plane .",
    "for calculating integral turbulent length scales @xmath97 we determine the longitudinal correlation functions of the turbulent velocity field in each plane .",
    "these correlation functions are approximated by exponential function and integral scales are calculated by integration of these functions .",
    "it must be noted that the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate is different for various components of turbulent velocity fluctuations although the difference is not large .",
    "indeed , the contribution to @xmath88 of the @xmath16-component is 0.27 while contributions of the turbulent velocity components in the @xmath31 plane are 0.35 and 0.38 for @xmath95 and @xmath15 components , respectively .",
    "when turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate is calculated through a one - dimensional surrogate @xmath98 , as it is done in most experimental investigations , then the magnitude of the constant @xmath83 should be multiplied by a factor 1.23 which is the ratio of 1/3 and 0.27 .",
    "the magnitude of the renormalized constant @xmath83 is very close to that obtained in @xcite .",
    "it is conceivable to suggest that one of the reasons of the scatter in the measured value of the constant @xmath83 in the cited above studies is caused by anisotropy of the turbulent velocity field .    using the data obtained from the measured velocity field in many planes we determine the shear - induced production term @xmath99 of the turbulent kinetic energy .",
    "the main contributions to the production term are due the following terms : @xmath100 + \\nu_{_{tx } } \\ , ( \\nabla_x u_z)^2 \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\nu_{_{ty } } \\ , ( \\nabla_y u_z)^2 + ... \\ ; , \\label{a21}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath101 and similarly for @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "the production term is averaged over the planes .",
    "other contributions in the production term are small due to a small corresponding large - scale derivative of the mean velocity field or they vanish after integration over @xmath15 [ e.g. , @xmath104 if we take into account that the large - scale circulation is nearly anti - symmetric relative to its central line @xmath105 ( see figs .  [ fig2]-[fig3 ] ) , where @xmath106 is the vertical size of the large - scale circulation ] .",
    "our measurements of the turbulent heat flux inside the coherent structures show that in the regions outside the upward and downward large - scale motions the vertical component of the turbulent heat flux is very small .",
    "in particular , the measured vertical turbulent heat flux @xmath107 inside the upward and downward large - scale motions for @xmath108 k is @xmath109 k cm s@xmath110 , while outside the upward and downward large - scale motions it is smaller by at least one order of magnitude . for these conditions temperature fluctuations",
    "are of the order of @xmath111 k , the velocity fluctuations are @xmath112 cm s@xmath110 and the correlation coefficient is 0.6 .",
    "turbulence production by the vertical turbulent heat flux @xmath113 inside the upward and downward large - scale motions is of the order of @xmath114 @xmath115 s@xmath110 ( upper estimate ) .",
    "the area of the vertical flow is of the order of 20 % ( upper estimate ) of the area of heat exchangers , which implies that the contribution of the turbulent heat flux to the production turbulence is @xmath116 @xmath115 s@xmath110 .",
    "measured turbulent energy production due to flow shear , averaged over the central part of the flow , is @xmath117 @xmath115 s@xmath110 for @xmath118 k. since in the investigated temperature range the turbulent energy production due to flow shear @xmath119 is approximately proportional to @xmath10 , the magnitude of @xmath119 at @xmath108 k is of the order of @xmath120 @xmath115 s@xmath110 .",
    "consequently , the contribution of the turbulent heat flux to turbulent energy production can be estimated as 5 % ( upper estimate ) .",
    "this implies that the production of the turbulent kinetic energy in the turbulent convection in the regions outside the upward and downward large - scale motions is caused by shearing motions in the coherent structures . in the vicinity of the upward and downward large - scale motions",
    "the contribution to production of the turbulent kinetic energy is due to the shear - induced term , @xmath99 , and to the lesser extent by the buoyancy - induced term , @xmath121 .",

    "consider the @xmath95 component of * curl * of the momentum equation for the mean velocity @xmath77 . in a steady - state",
    "this equation yields the following estimate @xmath144 .",
    "therefore , the velocity shear can be estimated as @xmath145 , where @xmath146 , @xmath147 is the characteristic mean temperature inside the coherent structure and @xmath106 is the vertical size of the coherent structure .",
    "here we take into account that @xmath148 , the turbulent viscosity @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "on the other hand , our experiments demonstrate that @xmath151 const ( see , fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the turbulent velocity can be estimated as @xmath152 .    if we assume that @xmath153 and @xmath154 , we obtain the following scalings for the turbulent velocity field : @xmath155 and for the dissipation rate of the turbulent kinetic energy : @xmath156 in the latter estimate for @xmath88 we assumed that the turbulent length scales @xmath49 are nearly independent of the temperature difference @xmath10 between the bottom and the top walls of the chamber ( see fig .  [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "the assumption about the linear dependence @xmath154 of the horizontal temperature difference @xmath143 on the vertical temperature difference @xmath10 , is confirmed by our measurements ( see fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] where the dependence of the horizontal temperature difference @xmath141 inside one cell of the two - cell coherent structure versus the vertical temperature difference @xmath10 between the bottom and the top walls of the chamber with @xmath1 obtained in our experiments is shown ) .",
    "notably , our experiments also show that the shear - induced production of the turbulent kinetic energy scales as @xmath157 where @xmath158 for @xmath1 and @xmath159 for @xmath34 ( see fig .  [ fig11 ] ) .",
    "a small difference in the exponents in the above estimates and the experimental results might be caused by the weak dependence of the turbulent length scales on the temperature difference @xmath10 , and a small deviation from the linear dependence @xmath154 .    in this study we presented the dependencies of the turbulent flow parameters versus the temperature difference @xmath10 between the bottom and the top walls of the chamber rather than on global rayleigh number , ra = @xmath160 , because of the following reasons .",
    "our experiments among the others demonstrate that the life - time of large - scale circulations ( lsc ) is much larger than the characteristic turbulence time scale @xmath9 , and characteristic spatial scales of lsc are much larger than the characteristic turbulence spatial scales .",
    "the time of transport of a fluid particle through lsc is much larger than the time @xmath9 .",
    "this implies that lsc can be described in terms of a mean - field approach , i.e. , lsc is a mean - field object .",
    "therefore , turbulent viscosity and turbulent temperature diffusivity , which are much larger than molecular transport coefficients ( the kinematic viscosity , @xmath161 , and the temperature diffusivity , @xmath162 ) , become more important . consequently , the effective rayleigh number based on turbulent viscosity and turbulent temperature diffusivity , is an important parameter characterizing the properties of lsc .",
    "it is plausible to suggest also that when the global rayleigh number is much larger than the threshold value required for the excitation of convection , the properties of lsc are weakly dependent on the magnitude of the global rayleigh number .",
    "we show the dependencies of the turbulent flow parameters versus the temperature difference @xmath10 between the bottom and the top walls of the chamber with two aspect ratios @xmath34 and @xmath1 in the same figure . when the temperature difference @xmath10 is varied , the kinematic viscosity @xmath163 , the temperature diffusivity @xmath164 and the parameter @xmath165 which depend on the mean fluid temperature , are also changed .",
    "therefore , several variables @xmath166 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 ) in the expression for the global rayleigh number are changed when the temperature difference @xmath10 is varied .",
    "another reason for using the temperature difference @xmath10 rather than the global rayleigh number as independent variable is that we determined theoretically the scalings of the production rate @xmath119 and turbulent ( rms ) velocity @xmath6 with the temperature difference @xmath10 rather than on global rayleigh number , ra .",
    "however , for comparing our results with other studies we also presented some dependencies of the turbulent flow parameters versus global rayleigh number ( see fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] ) .",
    "dependencies of the vertical component @xmath54 of the measured turbulent velocity ( upper panel ) and the production rate @xmath119 ( lower panel ) versus the global rayleigh number @xmath167 ( in log - log scale ) obtained in the experiments with turbulent convection in the chamber with @xmath34 ( triangles for two - cell flow pattern and circles for one - cell flow pattern ) and @xmath1 ( squares for two - cell flow pattern ) .",
    "the list - square fit for the experimental results is shown by dashed line for @xmath34 and by dashed - dotted line for @xmath1 .",
    "the production rate @xmath119 is measured in cm@xmath36 s@xmath126 and the turbulent time is measured in cm s@xmath110.,width=302 ]",
    "we investigated the effect of large - scale coherent structures on global properties of turbulent convection in laboratory experiments .",
    "the turbulent convection for the rayleigh numbers varying from @xmath2 to @xmath3 , was studied in air flow in a rectangular chamber with aspect ratios @xmath34 and @xmath1 .",
    "the large - scale coherent structures comprise the one - cell and two - cell flow patterns .",
    "it was demonstrated that turbulent convection with large - scale coherent structures is a shear - produced turbulence .",
    "we determined the dependence of global parameters ( the production and dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy , the turbulent velocity and integral turbulent scale , the large - scale shear , etc . ) of turbulent convection on the temperature difference between the bottom and the top walls of the chamber .",
    "these dependencies are in an agreement with theoretical predictions .    equation  ( [ a1 ] ) that is valid for a a buoyancy - produced turbulence , yields much smaller values for the turbulent kinetic energy than those observed in our experiments .",
    "the production of the turbulent kinetic energy in turbulent convection , caused by the buoyancy flux , even in the upward and downward flow regions is much smaller than the production rate due to the shear motions inside the large - scale coherent structures . inside the coherent structures where the vertical heat flux is very small , the production of the turbulent kinetic energy , caused by the buoyancy flux , is by several orders of magnitude smaller than the production rate due to the shear motions .",
    "the large - scale coherent structures are formed due to large - scale instability caused by a redistribution of the turbulent heat flux due to non - uniform motions .",
    "as soon as the large - scale coherent structures are formed , there is a strong influence of the shear produced by the coherent structures . in particular , the main contribution to production of turbulence is due to shearing motions inside the large - scale coherent structures .",
    "the magnitude of the large - scale shear is determined by the horizontal mean temperature gradient inside the large - scale circulation .",
    "these features are different from those which are typical for the classical laminar convection ."
