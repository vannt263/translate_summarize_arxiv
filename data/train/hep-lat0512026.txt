    "in ref.@xcite we worked out the quark mass dependence of @xmath0 at the leading and next - to - leading one - loop level in manifestly covariant @xmath2 baryon chiral perturbation theory ( bchpt ) .",
    "we neglect isospin breaking effects and translate the functional dependence on the ( light ) quark mass into a pion mass dependence according to the gell - mann - oakes - renner relation .",
    "we evaluate all the relevant graphs using the so - called infrared regularization method @xcite which represents a variant of dimensional regularization able to treat one - loop integrals involving baryon propagators in a way consistent with chiral power counting , in a manifestly lorentz invariant framework .    in the numerical analysis",
    "we have estimated parameters not fixed by chiral symmetry by fitting the relevant formulae to a combined set of fully dynamical two - flavor lattice qcd data for @xmath0 versus @xmath4 obtained by the cp - pacs@xcite , jlqcd@xcite and qcdsf - ukqcd@xcite collaborations . in order to minimize artifacts from discretization and finite volume effects ,",
    "we have selected from the set of available simulations those with lattice spacing @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the spatial size of the lattice .",
    "we have not considered partial quenching effects , selecting lattice calculations with valence quark masses equal to sea quark masses .",
    "we assume that there is an overlap between the region of quark masses where @xmath2 bchpt is applicable and the range of quark masses presently accessible to full - qcd lattice calculations , and explore the consequences of this assumption .",
    "we have restricted ourselves to @xmath8 .    in fig.[figconv ]",
    "we plot the best - fit curve coming from the next - to - leading one - loop expression .",
    "we include the physical point as a constraint .",
    "the output parameters show high degree of consistency with information from low - energy @xmath9 and @xmath10 scattering @xcite .",
    "statistically compatible results have been obtained by fitting with the @xmath11 heavy baryon expression , which coincides with the @xmath11 expression in the covariant framework truncated at @xmath12 in the chiral expansion .",
    "this confirms the outcome of ref.@xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have taken into account finite ( spatial ) volume effects , and fitted to an enlarged set of lattice data ( @xmath13 ) @xcite using the @xmath11 expression worked out by the qcdsf - ukqcd collaboration @xcite .",
    "our results in the infinite volume are very nicely confirmed by those fits @xcite .",
    "fig.[figconv ] also shows that the difference between the leading and the next - to - leading one - loop result can be kept reasonably small over the whole range of @xmath4 that we analyze .",
    "the @xmath11 pion mass dependence of the pion - nucleon sigma term can be obtained by applying the feynman - hellmann theorem to the expression of @xmath14 at the next - to - leading one - loop order . according to the outcome of the corresponding fit for @xmath0",
    ", we obtain @xmath15 at the physical pion mass @xcite , in perfect agreement with the outcome of the analysis by gasser , leutwyler and sainio , @xmath16 @xcite .      in fig.[bands ] we show the statistical error band corresponding to the 68% joint confidence region for the fit parameters in @xmath14 at order @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the errors on the lattice pion masses have been taken into account as well .",
    "the inclusion of the physical nucleon mass is crucial to shrink the bands below about @xmath18 in pion mass . in order to extract information from present lattice data about the region of small quark masses within our systematic approach",
    ", we should either incorporate phenomenological input or perform simultaneous fits to several observables characterized by a common subset of low - energy parameters .    : global statistical error band associated with the 68% joint confidence region for the fit parameters at order @xmath17 .",
    "the physical point together with the data up to @xmath19 in @xmath4 have been included as input .",
    "the best - fit curve is also plotted.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      following the strategy outlined above we have analyzed @xmath14 in the context of an effective field theory which apart from nucleons and pseudo - goldstone bosons includes the @xmath20 as an explicit degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "the theoretical framework of our analysis is covariant @xmath2 bchpt with infrared regularization in the presence of spin-3/2 fields @xcite .",
    "the delta - nucleon mass splitting in the @xmath2 chiral limit is treated as a small parameter and included in the power counting according to the so - called small scale expansion ( sse)@xcite .",
    "fig.[deltamass ] shows the pion mass dependence of @xmath0 at leading - one - loop order in manifestly covariant sse @xcite , see refs.@xcite .",
    "the curve is again obtained by imposing the physical constraint and fitting to the available two - flavor fully dynamical lattice qcd data compatible with the cuts explained above , up to @xmath21 . as in the previous case ,",
    "the estimated parameters come out of natural size and compatible with available information from phenomenology @xcite . in fig.[deltamass ] the best - fit curve is plotted together with the 68% error band for the @xmath11 fit in the scheme with pion and nucleon as explicit degrees of freedom . treating the @xmath20 as a dynamical variable is not essential for a satisfactory description of the pion mass dependence of the nucleon mass .",
    "an equally successful interpolation can be obtained by `` freezing '' the delta effects into low - energy constants .     with explicit @xmath20 degrees of freedom",
    ": best - fit curve based on the leading - one - loop expression for @xmath14 in manifestly covariant small scale expansion .",
    "the 68% confidence level error band for the fit at order @xmath17 in covariant @xmath2 bchpt with @xmath9 degrees of freedom is shown as well.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "we have compared also for @xmath1 the chiral effective field theory schemes with and without explicit @xmath3 degrees of freedom , both in their non - relativistic @xcite and manifestly lorentz invariant form with infrared regularization @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "we have evaluated the contributions up to leading and next - to leading one - loop order in @xmath2 bchpt and used as input for the numerical analysis a set of ( quenched ) lattice data points provided by riken - bnl - columbia - kek collaboration @xcite .",
    "full - qcd simulations for @xmath22 are reported by the same collaboration to be fully consistent with the quenched results @xcite . in the scheme _ without _ explicit @xmath3 degrees of freedom , both at leading and next - to - leading one - loop level , it is impossible to get a successful intepolating curve between lattice data and the physical point with parameters in agreement with low - energy @xmath9 scattering analyses , cf . also the talk by ulf - g .",
    "meiner in this workshop and ref .",
    "@xcite . however , intermediate spin-3/2 resonance contributions are known to play a very important role in this context .",
    "recall , for example , the adler - weisberger sum rule @xcite which relates the deviation of @xmath1 from 1 to pion - nucleon dynamics and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking : @xmath23+\\,\\dots \\nonumber\\ ] ] where the integral of the difference of the @xmath24 and @xmath25 total cross - sections is taken over the pion momentum in the nucleon rest frame and @xmath26 denotes the pion energy in that frame .",
    "terms of order @xmath27 are neglected .",
    "the @xmath28-wave contributions from the nucleon and delta pole terms @xcite give total @xmath29 cross - sections which , according to the adler - weisberger sum rule , yield @xmath30 .",
    "if we take into account only the @xmath28-wave born terms for static nucleons , we get @xmath31 @xcite .        the best - fit curve including the physical constraint is shown in fig.[gauno ] .",
    "the axial-@xmath32-@xmath32 coupling @xmath33 is treated as a free parameter , while the value of axial-@xmath34-@xmath32 coupling is an input for the fit , cf .",
    "fig.[diag ] . for a choice of the latter according to the relativistic expression of the @xmath35 strong decay width",
    ", the fit prefers values of the former close to the @xmath36 quark model prediction @xmath37 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for an analysis of finite volume effects for @xmath1 in the same theoretical framework we use .",
    "see also the contribution by meinulf gckeler to this workshop .      in fig.[gauno ]",
    "we plot also the leading - one - loop ( dashed ) curve in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory , as extracted from the fit in sse , cf .",
    "clearly , it can not represent correctly the pion mass dependence of @xmath1 outside a region of extremely small pion masses , as already reported in @xcite .",
    "the `` chiral log '' in the leading - non - analytic term of the quark mass expansion of @xmath1 is only visible for pion masses well below the physical one @xcite .",
    "when we analyze the separate contributions to the best fit curve in sse ( the solid / dotted one in fig.[gauno ] ) corresponding to the different one - loop diagrams , it turns out that the graph with two delta propagators plays an important role at the pion masses presently manageable on the lattice , in order to counterbalance the trend shown by the graphs with no delta , see fig.[gadue ] . if the @xmath3 is thought to be too heavy to propagate , the @xmath38 graph starts contributing at order @xmath39 in the scheme restricted to pions and nucleons only , via a fifth order tadpole with an attached external axial field .",
    "therefore the contribution from this diagram starts at higher order with respect to our previous calculation in @xmath2 bchpt performed up to next - to - leading one - loop .",
    "fig.[gaextra ] shows a chiral extrapolation based on the leading - one - loop expression in sse .",
    "here we have analyzed very recent lattice data by the lhp collaboration @xcite , with two light and one heavier flavors , cf .",
    "the talk by wolfram schroers in this workshop .",
    "the physical point has not been included as input . in the fit",
    "an effective low - energy coupling has been constrained according to the analysis by fettes _",
    "et al . _ of @xmath40 scattering @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the solid and dashed curves correspond to the central , upper and lower value for the previously mentioned coupling , as determined in ref.@xcite .",
    "the axial-@xmath32-@xmath32 coupling comes out close to the @xmath36 quark model prediction .",
    "interestingly , the inclusion of a heavier quark in the simulations yields results that are statistically compatible with the two - flavor case @xcite .",
