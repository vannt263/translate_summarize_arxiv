    "laws of thermodynamics are universally valid .",
    "the first - law is about the ` _ _ conservation _ _ of energy ' whereas the second - law is about ` _ _ conversion _ _ of energy ' .",
    "engineers give equal weightage to both these laws , but unfortunately the second - law has largely been ignored by physicists .",
    "the second - law of thermodynamics which basically tells about the ` irreversibility ' of the energy ( heat and work ) conversion process , has far - reaching consequences [ 2 - 4 ] .",
    "second law of thermodynamics @xcite implies that ` although work can be fully converted to heat , but heat can - not be fully converted to work ' .",
    "efficiency of ` work to heat conversion ' could be @xmath0 , but efficiency of ` heat to work conversion ' must be @xmath1 .",
    "the second law of thermodynamics can be used as best criterion to judge whether a certain form of energy is work or is heat .",
    "judging from this angle , as it is mentioned @xcite and elaborated in this paper that : it is very unfortunate that there are some misnomer and misconceptions which exists & prevails specially for the heat , right from the very beginning till now in our understanding , in books and literature .",
    "though these misnomer and misconceptions do not make much difference from engineering point of view , re - defining ` heat ' and ` work ' in the right - perspective of second - law - of - thermodynamics is necessary to revise our understanding at fundamental level as it has far reaching consequences at deeper level in physics [ 2 - 4 ] .",
    "+   + it is further shown that : though heat is considered as a statistical ( bulk ) property / aspect , but thermodynamics - laws are equally applicable even for a single photon interaction such as photoelectric - effect and compton - effect .",
    "it is also found that widely differing fields of study ` thermodynamics ' and ` special - relativity ' are inter - supportive to each other [ 5 - 12 ] .",
    "in thermodynamic - processes ` heat ' and ` work ' are generally considered obvious , but there are some basic misconceptions too . the so - called ` heat of a hot - body ' , as per second law of thermodynamics , is in fact not ` heat ' but ` work ' as it is due to vibration / motion of atoms / molecules . in electronic and other processes where usually ` energy'- transfer / transition / conversion takes place ,",
    "recognition of heat & work is even more difficult .",
    "_ * what is energy ? is energy ` heat ' or ` work ' ? * _ identification of different types of energies either as work or as heat is discussed in the next paragraphs and represented in figure 1 .",
    "+   + first consider the potential - energy , it is the work - done against a force and is stored as potential energy ; so potential energy is ` work ' .",
    "it is well known that when a stone falls from height , the potential energy changes to kinetic - energy , hence kinetic energy too is ` work ' i.e. , energy of motion and vibration of molecules and atoms are work .",
    "stored energy of an electron in atom is sum of its potential energy and kinetic energy , is thus again the stored energy is ` work ' . with furthermore arguments , it can be shown that : all stored energies such as electrostatic energy , chemical energy , internal energy , nuclear energy / mass energy @xmath2 etc .",
    "are in - fact ` work ' . though all stored energies are ` work ' ; the energy with moving particle is ` work ' if the energy is kinetic - energy and it is ` heat ' if the energy is radiation - energy . in - fact",
    "_ * ` heat ' is the energy carried by mass - less particle such as photon , whereas all other form of energy carried by mass - ive material particle are ` work ' * _ ( figure 1 ) . in other words , messenger - particles bosons ( photons )",
    "carry the ` heat ' as radiation , whereas material - particles fermions ( or fermion - groups as atoms / molecules ) carry ` work ' as kinetic & stored energy in the particle / matter . to illustrate - which energy is ` work ' and which one is ` heat ' a ray - table",
    "is shown as follows ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the conclusion that  heat is carried by massless - particle ` _ _ photon _ _ ' reminds / revives the old caloric - concept [ 13 - 15 ] of heat as ` energy in transit ' by massless - fluid ` _ _ caloric _ _ ' .",
    "+   +        let us look at the question ` what is work ' from a different angle .",
    "work is the energy spent against a force , and this is either stored as potential - energy or delivered as kinetic - energy .",
    "kinetic - energy is a ` kinetic ' manifestation of the ` static ' potential - energy , and both are interchangeable to each other .",
    "next question may be ` what are the forces against which work could be done ' .",
    "there are four fundamental forces of nature : gravitational , electromagnetic and nuclear ( weak & strong ) .",
    "the other forces such as muscle - force , hammer - force , explosive - force etc .",
    "are all basically electromagnetic force .",
    "so , _ * all the energies , except radiation - energy , are ` work'*_. +   + now let us examine what we mean by ` heat of a hot body ' . the word ` heat ' here is a misnomer , ` _ _ heat _ _ of the hot body ' is due to motion and vibration of molecules and atoms and thus what we say as ` heat ' is actually due to kinetic and internal energy which are really in the category of ` work ' . +   + in thermodynamics",
    ", conventionally it is said that disordered motion is heat whereas ordered motion is work , this too is a misconception . both disordered and ordered motion energy",
    "are work , we may say it disordered work and ordered work .",
    "we can not distinguish energy of a crowd as heat and energy of a military - platoon as work ; similarly , we can not distinguish that energy of ordinary light as heat and energy of laser beam as work .",
    "the energy of crowd or platoon both are work , whereas energy of light or laser both are heat ; since in the former example energy is carried by mass - ive material body whereas in the later example energy is carried by mass - less particle ( photon ) .",
    "+   + now let us consider the conventionally called ` heat - transfer ' @xcite ; it is said that the transfer is through ( i ) conduction , ( ii ) convection and ( iii ) radiation .",
    "but a careful re - examination of the fact would reveal that the literally real ` heat - transfer ' is only through radiation only where the heat ( radiation energy ) is transferred from one place to the other . the transfer of energy in conduction and convection in in - fact the kinetic - energy transfer from one atom / molecule to the other , so it should be called ` work - transfer ' .",
    "thus in place of ` heat - transfer ' name , ` energy - transfer ' name would be a better name because this includes all the three modes of energy transfer through conduction , convection and radiation ; ` heat and mass transfer ' name is also acceptable because mass in itself implies energy too .",
    "+   + now let us consider how energy is emitted and is absorbed .",
    "energy emission can be viewed as the release of energy when say electron / atom / molecule goes from a higher energy level to a lower energy level , releasing full energy change @xmath3 ( work ) in full to heat @xmath4 . however",
    ", when heat @xmath4 falls on an opaque body , a part of it may be reflected from surface - atoms and the remaining is absorbed .",
    "this remaining energy goes to impart kinetic energy & internal energy to molecules & atoms ; only part of ` the absorbed part of heat ' converts into ` work ' , some energy must go as waste ( reflected / radiated from inside atoms ) .",
    "so , as per second law of thermodynamics even the blackest of black - body can not have @xmath5 absorptivity of heat i.e. , @xmath6 can - not be equal to 1 but must be very slightly less than 1 .",
    "+   + when it comes to the meaning of temperature of a hot body ; conventionally it is thought that it is a measure of the level of heat but truly speaking it is measure of level of energy ( work ) contained in it .",
    "also , we speak that internal energy is due to vibration of atoms / molecules viz . @xmath7 for solid @xcite , which means that temperature ( t ) is a measure of kinetic energy ( work ) .",
    "+   + energy - wise heat ( q ) and work ( w ) are equivalent by the joule s relationship @xmath8 . though w & q are equivalent by the above relation , but the transformation - processes of ` work to heat ' and ` heat to work ' are different ( efficiency - wise ) from the point of view of second law of thermodynamics .",
    "first law of thermodynamics ( energy conservation ) states _ equivalence of w _ & _ q energy - wise _ , whereas the second law of thermodynamics ( entropy increase ) implies the _ non - equivalence or irreversibility in its conversion_.",
    "conventionally , heat is considered to be an averaged quantity , so questions arise ` whether a single photon has heat property and that whether applying second - law - of - thermodynamics to single photon interaction such as photoelectric - effect and compton - effect are reasonable or not ? ' the authors answer both these questions as yes and yes , and firmly states that indeed it is reasonable because : ( i ) average of a single data is also a quantity i.e. , the data itself ; a photon of energy @xmath9 has its average energy too as @xmath4 , ( ii ) though from the very beginning ( much before the birth of photon - concept ) it has been considered ( in view of kinetic theory of gases ) that heat is statistical ( bulk ) property ; but no - one established this or no - law dictates that the second - law - of - thermodynamics can not be applied to a single photon interaction .",
    "this means that nothing forbids / prohibits and is therefore permissible ; in fact single photon interactions ( such as photoelectric and compton effects ) are neat examples of applicability of both the first and second law of thermodynamics , ( iii ) it is shown @xcite ( and will be reproduced again for clarity & completeness ) that not only the applicability holds good very well but also shows new light ( understanding ) i.e. , it leads to conclusion that the second - law - of - thermodynamics is in accordance with the basic idea of special - relativity , ( iv ) the theory of relativity is applicable well to single - particle therefore the second law of thermodynamics too should be applicable , since both are shown to be interlinked [ 5 - 12 ] .",
    "the photoelectric - effect @xcite equation for a single photon interaction @xmath10 is indeed in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics @xmath11 , which means that the work - function @xmath12 corresponding to @xmath13 can never be zero ( and that is true ) .",
    "the thermodynamic - efficiency of the process is therefore @xmath14 .",
    "the compton - effect @xcite equation for energy conversion ( first law of thermodynamics ) @xmath15 or more precisely ( with relativistic consideration ) +   + @xmath16 +   + is also in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics @xmath17 , which means that @xmath18 can never be zero ( and that is true ) .",
    "the thermodynamic - efficiency of the process is , similar to that of photoelectric effect , therefore @xmath19 .      for a rough estimate of temperature of a photon coming out from its source ,",
    "the photon s energy @xmath20 is equated to the internal energy 3kt of the source .",
    "this yields @xmath21 which is quite similar to the source - temperature estimate by wein s law @xcite @xmath22 .",
    "however , the single photon temperature is usually high , but its effect is not appreciably felt physically unless a large number of photons fall upon and absorbed fully .",
    "moreover , only a part of photon s energy is absorbed on the receiver body and that too further radiates - back as high - wavelength radiation .",
    "+   + assigning a temperature to photon(s ) is not something that is completely new : cosmologist often ascribe a temperature of @xmath23 to cosmic - microwave - background ( cmb ) radiation ( photons)[18 - 22 ] .",
    "usually a ` color ' is linked to ` temperature ' , and whole range of vibgyor spectrum are linked to its corresponding temperatures .",
    "+   + photon do has heat property ; heat of thermal - photon can be physically felt , it is the photons which heats the food in the microwave - oven or solar - cooker .",
    "our sensory - organs too are made of materials - atoms ( fermions ) , part of the photon s energy is first taken - up by the organ and the energy - transfer communicated to the brain - matter .",
    "even the instruments ( material ) absorb the energy and the expansion ( of say , hg material ) calibrated . though photon s heat is measured with the intervention of some material ( sensory organ or measuring - instrument ) , but it is true that photon do has heat property and has a temperature too .",
    "if we are unable to see something , that does nt mean that it does nt exist ; we do not see atoms but atoms do exist , and we have indirect evidences for its presence .",
    "ironically , everything which we see around us is visible only due to presence of apparently - invisible photon .",
    "presence of photon and its heat , however , can be sensed as solar - radiation , viewed as chemical - reaction taking place on photographic - plate or can be heard as radio - song and so on .",
    "even the absence - of - photon as shadow indicates its existence .",
    "photon is essential for photosynthesis , and it can be further argued that the essence of life is photon and its heat . _ whole range of electromagnetic radiation is heat ; though our - sensory organs ( hearing , seeing and feeling - heat ) may be more receptive only to certain range of frequencies_.",
    "consider the compton - effect again . `",
    "the outgoing photon ought to exist , i.e. , @xmath18 can never be zero ( which is in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics ) ' is re - studied further considering the two possibilities : +   + ( i ) if the incident photon @xmath24 strikes the electron in x - direction and if after collision the electron is deflected - away from x - direction , the changed - photon @xmath25 ought to come - out to balance the ` momentum of electron in y - direction ' .",
    "+   + ( ii ) if the incident photon @xmath24 strikes the electron in x - direction and if after collision the electron too moves in x - direction , the changed - photon @xmath26 after impact may come - out in x - direction . this possibility is further analyzed as follows .",
    "+   + the energy - equation of compton - effect can be re - written using @xmath27 as follows , +   + @xmath28 +   + and the conservation of momentum for possibility ( ii ) using @xmath29 yields , +   + @xmath30 +   + putting the value of @xmath31 from one equation into the other and after simplification , the following interesting result is found to emerge - out as +   + @xmath32 +   + which is well _ in - accordance _ with the basic concept of the theory of relativity .",
    "+   + this means that the result of second law of thermodynamics ( @xmath33 is never zero , ` heat to work ' conversion @xmath34 ) is compatible with the essence of special - relativity ( @xmath35 i.e. , no matter how energetic may be the incident photon , velocity of electron can not exceed velocity of light c , implying @xmath36 ) .",
    "it is amazing that how two quite different fields of study - ` thermodynamics @xmath37 ' and  relativity @xmath38 are inter - supportive and inter - linked to each other and appear to be the two faces of the same coin .",
    "the link of thermodynamics and relativity has been reported [ 5 - 12 ] earlier also .",
    "probably the root - cause of the confusion about heat & work arises due to the fact that both ( heat & work ) can give rise to a feel of temperature to our senses .",
    "but if we widen our thought - horizon to encompass both heat and work as ingredients ( as follows ) for temperature , the confusion about heat and work diminishes .",
    "the confusion / misconception however can not be removed completely in one go , it needs time for our mind - set to adopt for the change / revision .",
    "work and heat can be considered to be related to temperature ( of say , solid ) as follows : + now , let us re - view heat and work in the popular equation of first law of thermodynamics ( energy conservation ) : @xmath39 .",
    "each terms are discussed in some details for clarification , as follows .",
    "+   + * dq * : it is the input - energy ( heat ) to the system .",
    "it is usually the stored - energy ( work ) of the fuel which is released as heat @xmath40 after ignition and which is then transferred to atoms / molecules as kinetic - energy ( work ) ; part of this kinetic - energy @xmath41 goes as internal - energy ( du ) to the gas & the container - body and part of which is used up to produce work ( dw ) through piston - motion .",
    "some input energy goes as waste as radiation @xmath42 as a necessity dictated by the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "+   + * du * : it is the kinetic - energy @xmath41 of the atoms & molecules of the exhaust gas & the container body .",
    "it is also called as internal or thermal - energy . as discussed ( & tabulated ) earlier , the kinetic - energy is like work but it gives a feel of temperature , so usually misunderstood as heat .",
    "+   + * dw * : part of the kinetic - energy of the combustion gases produces useful work @xmath43 through piston motion .",
    "part of this work is used for useful work ( such as raising a load or moving a vehicle ) ; whereas part of it goes as waste against , say , friction - resistance and goes as thermal - energy @xmath44 and finally goes off as radiation heat . + for constant - volume process or for heating solid @xmath45 hence for it @xmath46,similar to the second - law - of - thermodynamics equation @xmath47 , indicating that du is like work . +   + * losses * : there are two types of losses viz . ,",
    "( 1 ) @xmath48 and ( 2 ) @xmath49 , re - explained as follows . +   + ( i ) @xmath48 is the loss from the total work produced ; the total work produced @xmath50 is equal to sum of useful work @xmath51 and loss due to friction etc . @xmath44 .",
    "thus as per _ ` first law ' _ of thermodynamics @xmath52 .",
    "+   + ( ii ) @xmath49 is the loss dictated by the _ ` second law ' _ of thermodynamics , some energy must go as waste radiation energy .",
    "+   + ( iii ) taking into , account both the _",
    "` first law ' _ and _ ` second law ' _ of thermodynamics , the final equation is as follows : @xmath53 .",
    "let us have another look ( figure 2 ) on the basic question - ` what is energy , is it heat or work ? '",
    ".        to reconcile with the prevailing / conventional concept of heat - transfer ; instead of categorizing energies into only heat and work , if we categorize ( as follows ( figure 2 ) ) energies into _ three _ categories namely - heat , work and therm ( the term for the internal or thermal energy ) , the whole confusion seems to fade away .",
    "it may , however , be seen that the complex inter - conversion among work , therm ( thermal - energy ) and heat occurs .",
    "for example , the fuel s chemical energy is first released as heat ( dq ) which converts to thermal - energy ( du ) and work ( dw ) plus losses ( figure 2 ) .",
    "+   + work ( dw ) is work and heat ( dq ) is heat , but the thermal energy ( du ) i.e. , therm ( though actually being manifestation of stored work ) is considered as heat ; since heat @xmath54 and thermal - energy @xmath41 both gives a feel of temperature t , as explained earlier .",
    "+   + so in the new light of work , therm , and heat ; the modes of heat transfer conduction and convection is through therm - transfer whereas radiation is due to photon - transfer .",
    "you feel the heat of a coke - oven at a distance through photon - transfer , but if you touch the hot - coke the feel of heat ( hotness ) is due to therm transfer .",
    "if we consider the ` therm and photon ' together as one word ` caloric ' , the confusion about heat transfer fades away in favor of caloric - transfer , but this reminds and revives the old ` caloric theory ' [ 13 - 15 ] of heat - transfer .",
    "` law(s ) of thermodynamics ' are not simply meant for engineers only .",
    "its great- ness goes much beyond @xcite .",
    "it is said @xcite ` that the four laws of thermody - namics ( zeroth , first , second and third ) drives the universe , and that not knowing ( appreciating ) the second - law of thermodynamics is like never having read a work of shakespeare ' !",
    "physicists have great respect for special - relativity and other physical - laws , but in - general ignore the importance of the second - law of thermodynamics .",
    "+   + the first law of thermodynamics tells about _ equivalence _ of work and heat , energy - wise , indicating energy - conservation .",
    "but the second law of thermodynamics tells about _ non - equivalence _ of work - to - heat and heat - to - work conversion - processes indicating irreversibility ( asymmetry ) ; this asymmetry in the second - law could be due to not - so - obvious but hidden asymmetry in special - relativity .",
    "+   + the second law of thermodynamics is not simply a law of thermodynamics dealing with engines and refrigerators .",
    "it has much more significance at fundamental level especially in physics as discussed in earlier - papers [ 2 - 4 ] .",
    "it is also seen as law of entropy - increase of the system .",
    "it also indicates and establish the fact of irreversibility .",
    "this thus points towards the thermodynamic arrow of time @xcite which differentiates past from future .",
    "the asymmetry hidden in it due to the irreversibility seems to be the cause of homo - chirality [ 27 - 31 ] in biological molecules .",
    "thus the key to life and our existence ( or anthropic - principle @xcite ) could be embedded in the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "if the second law of thermodynamics is so important fundamentally and that it differentiates between ` work to heat ' or ` heat to work ' conversion , it would be right - time to clearly elaborate and re - define heat and work in the right perspective to avoid / remove any misnomer / misconception unfortunately prevailing till now .",
    "heat and work both are energy , but it is not obvious what the different forms of energies are : work or heat . from the right - perspective of second - law - of - thermodynamics it is concluded that ` heat is carried by mass - less messenger particles photons , whereas work is carried by mass - ive material particles fermions ' . the prevailing misnomer / misconception about heat and heat - transfer is removed .",
    "studies on ` single photon interaction ' indicates that though in - general heat is a statistical - property but there exists heat property and temperature to single photon too . to reconcile with the present understanding of heat - transfer , a new term ` therm '",
    "is used for internal - energy , the ` therm and photon together ' reminds of the old concept of ` caloric ' .",
    "interestingly , the different fields of study ` thermodynamics ' and ` relativity ' are seen to be interlinked .",
