    "the nature of the sources responsible for ionising the neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) has been the subject of a long - standing debate .",
    "there are both observational and theoretical indications that some or perhaps all of this ionising background comes from stars and not hard sources , such as quasars . while it seems clear that quasars provide a significant contribution to the ionising background at low redshifts , @xmath14 , the steep drop in the abundance of bright quasars at earlier times brings into question whether they are capable of maintaining the ionised state of the igm at @xmath15 . in an earlier paper ( sokasian et al .",
    "2003 ) , we showed that the observed opacities in both h i and he ii indicate that quasars alone can not produce the required emissivity to match observations at @xmath16 .",
    "the situation is exacerbated at higher redshifts where observations by fan et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , becker et al . ( 2001 ) , and djorgovski et al . (",
    "2001 ) imply that the igm was highly ionised at @xmath7 even though the emissivity from bright quasars was likely unimportant . given this discrepancy",
    ", it appears that a substantial portion of the ultraviolet photons at @xmath17 were produced by an additional class of sources .",
    "it has been argued that star forming galaxies may yield the required ionising emissivities ( e.g. haehnelt et al .",
    "2001 , bianchi et al .",
    "2001 , steidel et al .",
    "2001 ) , although it is possible that harder low - luminosity active galactic nuclei ( agn ) may also make up the difference ( haiman & loeb 1998 ) . early star formation also provides a possible explanation for the widespread abundance of metals in the igm ( cowie et al . 1995 ) while reionisation by faint agns may provide a more plausible solution if the escape fraction for stellar radiation from galaxies is restrictively small ( schirber & bullock 2002 , wood & loeb 2000 ) .",
    "there have been numerous studies of cosmological reionisation using semi - analytical methods ( e.g. haardt & madau 1996 , madau et al .",
    "1999 , chiu & ostriker 2000 , valageas & silk 1999 ) . in these models",
    ", the impact of the uv background is treated using a spatially and directionally averaged radiative transfer equation which incorporates the mean luminosity function per unit volume for the source term and the statistical properties of absorbing clouds for the recombination term . inevitably though , to accurately address questions related to the time - dependent propagation of radiation fronts , especially during the early stages of the reionisation process where the radiation field is highly inhomogeneous , a detailed radiative transfer approach is required .",
    "this has proved to be an extremely challenging endeavour owing to the high dimensionality of the problem .",
    "a brief review of the problem and the various techniques which have been employed in recent years is presented in razoumov et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "one of the major challenges involved with such exercises is determining how to efficiently process the large number of sources that may be responsible for reionisation . in the case of bright quasars ,",
    "the associated number density is small enough that straightforward approaches can be employed ( e.g. sokasian et al .",
    "2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "the situation becomes much more difficult when galaxies are the primary sources . for typical cosmologies ,",
    "a @xmath18 mpc@xmath19 comoving volume can easily harbour @xmath20 star forming galaxies by @xmath21 .",
    "tracking the ionising flux from such a large pool of sources over many time steps inevitably requires the implementation of sophisticated algorithms designed to efficiently process the cumulative effects from each source . by combining a photon conserving algorithm with two independent hierarchies of trees , one for rays",
    "( abel & wandelt 2002 ) and one for the sources themselves , razoumov et al . (",
    "2002 ) were able to improve the efficiency of the calculations to study the inhomogeneous process of reionisation from star forming sources down to a redshift of @xmath22 .",
    "in particular , they were able to carefully follow time - dependent radiative transfer calculations on a uniform @xmath23 cartesian grid representing a volume with a comoving length of @xmath24 mpc on each side which stored the results of pre - computed hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation .",
    "as a result of their calculations , the authors were able to address a number of questions related to the morphological evolution of the reionisation process .",
    "in particular , they showed a picture of stellar reionisation in which photons initially do not travel far from ionising sources , in contrast to images from simulations by gnedin ( 2000 ) .",
    "more recently , ciardi et al . (",
    "2003b ) combined high - resolution n - body simulations and a semi - analytic model of galaxy formation with a monte carlo radiative transfer code to study reionisation in a volume with a comoving length of @xmath25 mpc . in their analysis",
    "they assessed the effect of the environment by performing a subsequent simulation on a smaller @xmath26 mpc comoving box centered on a cluster .",
    "they found that the environment where the radiation is produced modifies reionisation through the influence of the density dependence of the recombination rates .",
    "this conclusion raises the question of whether the exclusion of the copious number of dim low - mass sources which fall below the resolution limit of these simulations may play a more important role in determining the morphological evolution of the reionisation process .",
    "the fact that most models of galaxy formation predict that the bulk of the resultant ionising radiation is produced in relatively massive systems has provided some motivation for ignoring the low - mass sources altogether , especially in lieu of the high computational cost of radiative transfer calculations .",
    "however , since dim low - mass sources reside in relatively less clumpy environments compared to their brighter counterparts , their overall contribution to the ionising emissivity in the igm may be significant in spite of their intrinsic faintness .",
    "we examine the impact of low - mass sources by conducting very fast radiative transfer calculations capable of processing a large number of sources from high resolution hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "in particular , by supplementing our previous _",
    "one - step _ radiative transfer code ( see sokasian et al . 2001 ) with an adaptive ray tracing algorithm we are able to significantly speed up the calculations to the point where handling more than @xmath27 sources becomes technically feasible .",
    "our cosmological simulation is taken from a high resolution run in a series of calculations performed by springel & hernquist ( 2003a ) , and utilises @xmath28 particles in a box of comoving length @xmath29 mpc .",
    "radiative transfer calculations are then performed on a 200@xmath19 grid where we store the corresponding density fields at each redshift .",
    "this allows us to simulate reionisation with a source mass resolution that is about an order of magnitude below the limit of the ciardi et al .",
    "( 2003b ) simulations .",
    "furthermore , the use of a 200@xmath19 grid offers a factor of @xmath30 improvement in spatial resolution for the same box length .",
    "it is also important to point out that by using hydrodynamics to describe the gas physics , rather than an n - body simulation , we are able to estimate the clumping on unresolved scales in our grid by computing the spatial distribution of particles within a given cell ( see sokasian et al . 2001 ) .",
    "this represents an important advantage over the density interpolation schemes associated with n - body codes which smooth out density variations on sub - grid scales . as a result",
    "we expect to more properly account for the recombination rates in high density regions where clumping is important .    in the present paper , which is part of a series examining reionisation , we focus on the redshift interval @xmath31 to @xmath7 with specific interest in how the level of cosmic star formation predicted in the comprehensive set of hydrodynamic simulations conducted by springel & hernquist ( 2003a ) performs in the context of observational constraints on the opacity of the igm at @xmath7 .",
    "our method also treats the simultaneous reionisation of helium in the igm , allowing us to explore the plausibility of the scenario where agns are primarily responsible for reionisation .    here ,",
    "we restrict our attention to sources of radiation similar to normal , star - forming galaxies at the present day . in particular , we do not account for massive , population iii stars that may have been prevalent at @xmath32 .",
    "tentative measurements of polarisation in the cmb by the wmap satellite ( kogut et al .",
    "2003 ) suggest that much of the igm was ionised earlier than indicated by the sdss quasars ( e.g. , spergel et al .",
    "we explore the implications of this result in the context of our present model by allowing the escape fraction to evolve with redshift . in the future",
    ", we will explore the combined effect of reionisation by both population ii and population iii stars .    in the next section we review some of the technical aspects related to our method , including the approximations inherent to our radiative transfer calculations .",
    "we then follow with a description of the cosmological simulation that will be used in our analysis .",
    "next , we discuss our methodology for source selection and present an in - depth analysis regarding resolution effects and how to correct for them . finally , we discuss the results of our reionisation simulation and review the properties of the inhomogeneously ionised igm and make comparisons with observational constraints .",
    "in general , a description of the evolution of ionised regions around cosmological sources requires a full solution to the radiative transfer equation .",
    "such a solution would yield everywhere the monochromatic specific intensity of the radiation field in an expanding universe : @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a unit vector along the direction of the propagation of a ray with frequency @xmath35 . presently , it is computationally impractical to obtain a complete , multi - dimensional solution for @xmath36 at the high resolution required for cosmological simulations .",
    "our approach relies on an algorithm which approximates the full solution from ionising sources by semi - independently processing the net effect of each source separately ( see sokasian et al . 2001 ) .",
    "owing to the large number of sources and the fact that the order in which sources are processed is randomised at each step , the departure from the fully self - consistent solution is negligible .",
    "( we have verified this explicitly by running different cases in which the ordering of the sources varies and shown that our results are unaffected . ) by adopting this approximation , we are able to employ a simple jump condition to compute all radiative ionisations from a given source in a single step .",
    "this eliminates the need to repeatedly re - cast rays and calculate rates at every time step , thereby greatly speeding up the analysis .",
    "ionisation fractions within ionised regions are then computed by assuming photoionisation equilibrium .    to further speed up the calculations , the ray casting scheme used in sokasian et al .",
    "( 2001 ) has been modified to incorporate an adaptive scheme based on the method described by abel & wandelt ( 2002 ) .",
    "in particular , the transfer of direct source photons is computed on a uniform cartesian grid by casting a set of base rays which subsequently split hierarchically according to a local refinement criterion which involves keeping the ratio of the area of a cell to the area associated with the ray on a given hierarchical level above a fixed threshold value .",
    "this criterion ensures that a minimum number of rays pass through any given cell . the underlying pixelisation scheme that governs how rays are split has the property of exactly tiling a sphere with equal areas , ensuring equal photon flux per ray for isotropic sources .",
    "rays are propagated until they travel at most @xmath37 times the box length ( assuming periodic boundary conditions ) or the assigned number of photons is exhausted .",
    "once the ionisation level in the simulation box has reached significant levels , periodic boundary conditions are turned off and photons reaching the edges are added to a pool associated with the diffuse background . at the end of each interval , the effect of a diffuse ionising background is accounted for by casting rays of ionising radiation ( according to a detailed prescription ) inward from the sides of the simulation box .",
    "density fields , clumping factors and information regarding sources is specified from outputs at desired redshifts from the underlying cosmological simulation ( see sokasian et al .",
    "2001 for technical details ) .",
    "our approach entails a number of straightforward approximations to simplify the calculations ; we summarise them briefly here .",
    "first , our radiative transfer calculations are done on a uniform grid whose scale @xmath38 will always be much smaller than the horizon , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the speed of light and @xmath41 is the time dependent hubble constant .",
    "this eliminates the need to include doppler shifting of frequencies in line transfer calculations .",
    "additionally , if the light crossing time , @xmath42 , is much shorter than the ionisation timescale , the time dependence of the intensities drops out as well . in the volumes",
    "we simulate , this will certainly be true and so we make this approximation .",
    "next , we assume that the density field will experience negligible cosmological evolution during a single timestep",
    ". this assumption allows us to perform all our radiative calculations during a given timestep in a static density field , greatly reducing the complexity of the algorithm . in our analysis",
    "we find that a constant time step of @xmath43 yr satisfies the latter assumption and manages to capture the characteristic timescale over which source intensities change .",
    "moreover , we find that the chosen timestep allows us to reliably track the morphological evolution of the reionisation process during early epochs when the rate of sources switching on is relatively fast .    finally , we ignore the dynamical consequences of thermal feedback into the gas from radiative ionisation , enabling us to decouple our calculation of the radiation field from the hydrodynamical evolution of the gas .",
    "this allows us to use existing outputs from cosmological simulations to describe the evolving density field during the reionisation process . in reality",
    ", photoheating introduces extra thermal energy into the medium , and as ionisation fronts ( i - fronts ) move from small scales to large scales , there is a corresponding transfer of power from small to large scales through nonlinear evolution .",
    "this effect is somewhat accounted for in the underlying cosmological simulation used in this paper which includes a uniform ionising background capable of heating the gas .",
    "however , one also expects additional heating due to radiative transfer effects during the reionisation process , and such uniform backgrounds can not reproduce the observed increase in gas temperatures from the extra heating ( abel & haehnelt 1999 and references therein ) . as a result",
    ", we expect minor systematic errors to be present in our solutions .",
    "however , the main purpose of this paper is to describe the general morphological evolution of the reionisation process on large scales , which is insensitive to these systematic errors .",
    "in particular , recombination rates depend weakly on temperature and hence a proper accounting of photons is possible even if the temperatures are not computed precisely .",
    "one of the models we consider in this paper includes sources which are capable of ionising both hydrogen and helium simultaneously . in this case",
    ", it becomes necessary to couple the corresponding ionisation fractions during the radiative transfer calculations .",
    "exact solutions require taking into account the detailed frequency dependences of all the relevant processes and solving the multi - species chemical reaction flows in nonequilibrium ( e.g. anninos et al .",
    "owing to the large number of sources which need to be processed in our study , the implementation of a fully consistent nonequilibrium chemistry solver would require computations that are not presently feasible .",
    "fortunately , there are a number of simplifying approximations which we are able to employ that greatly speed up the calculations without compromising the main objectives of our study .",
    "our analysis of hydrogen and helium reionisation requires us to track three ionisation zones : h ii , he ii , and he iii . in order to simplify our calculations",
    ", we decouple the ionisation calculations by applying separate ray tracing calculations for each species . to properly account for the recombination rates implicit in the radiative transfer calculations , we are required to follow a particular ordering for the ray tracing .",
    "specifically , since he iii ionisation zones will always reside within h ii zones , we first apply ray tracing calculations for he ii reionisation which incorporate recombination rates based on electron densities that assume complete ionisation in both hydrogen and helium .",
    "although the equations for h i and he ii ionisation are , in principle , coupled , they can be separated to good accuracy using the fact that recombination processes from he iii to he ii are able to ionise h i. in particular , recombination emission from he ii l@xmath44 ( @xmath45 ev ) photons , which diffuse slowly owing to resonance scattering , and he ii balmer - continuum photons , which are concentrated close to the h i ionisation threshold , will tend to ionise h i within the he iii zone . for near cosmic abundances",
    ", these two processes are just about sufficient to balance h ii recombination within this zone ( e.g. osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "an additional source of h i ionising radiation produced in this zone is he ii two - photon continuum emission for which @xmath46 ev ( the spectrum peaks at 20.4 ev ) .",
    "most of these photons are able to escape out of the he iii zone and should , in principle , be added to to the pool of photons which will be responsible for ionising the h i zone . in order to access the maximal contribution from this process relative to the contribution already present from the stellar radiation field , we examine the hypothetical scenario where the igm is completely doubly ionised in helium by @xmath47 . assuming a gas temperature of @xmath48 k and a gas clumping factor of 30 , we estimate that the total contribution of ionising photons from he ii two - photon emission will comprise only 1% of the total number of photons produced directly from star - forming galaxies at the same redshift . given the fact that the uncertainties associated with intrinsic source intensities are larger , we ignore this additional component to simplify the calculations .",
    "once the he iii zone has been determined , the next step involves calculating the associated h ii and he ii zones around the same source .",
    "here we note that the stellar radiation field responsible for ionising the latter two species can only arise from the hottest ob stars in the galaxies .",
    "this assumption is based on the fact that only these stars have strong enough stellar winds capable of producing _ escape routes _ through the host galaxy for their ionising radiation . since the intrinsic spectra of ob stars yield a large fraction of photons with @xmath49 ev , the outer boundaries of the ionisation zones for h ii and he ii coincide , thereby allowing the tracking of both zones via a single ray tracing calculation . the approximation here will be to track h ii ionisations explicitly via ray tracing while implicitly assuming that he ii is ionised to the same degree and extent . since the relative cosmic abundance of helium is small ( @xmath50% by number density ) , the inaccuracies introduced by this approximation should be negligible .",
    "note that in carrying out the radiative transfer calculations for the ionisation of h i , we are careful to ignore h ii recombinations within the he iii regions for the reasons presented earlier .",
    "after the ionisation zones have been determined , ionisation fractions for he iii and h ii are calculated by applying the following equilibrium condition for each case , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the volume averaged gas clumping factor within the cell , @xmath53 is the temperature dependent case a recombination coefficient , and @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 are the ionised , neutral , and electron number densities , respectively . in this paper",
    ", we assume a constant temperature of @xmath57 k for all regions which have undergone ionisation to he iii and @xmath58 k for regions having undergone ionisation to h ii and he ii only , ( see abel and haehnelt 1999 ) .",
    "this allows us to simplify our calculations by using constant recombination coefficients . from the fitting formulae given in hui & gnedin ( 1997 )",
    ", we compute the relevant coefficients to be @xmath59 cm@xmath19 s@xmath61 and @xmath62 cm@xmath19 s@xmath61 for @xmath63 k and @xmath64",
    "cm@xmath19 s@xmath61 for @xmath65 k. the photoionisation rate in an ionised cell for a given species will be approximated by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the mean cross section for photoionisation , @xmath68 is the number of relevant ionising photons released per second from the source , and @xmath69 is the distance from the source to the cell in question . assuming that the sources have intrinsic spectral energy distributions of the form @xmath70 in the relevant frequency range of interest and that @xmath71 beyond the ionisation edge , we can approximate the mean photoionisation cross sections according to @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the cross section at the ionisation frequency . for stellar sources we choose @xmath74 ( up to 4 ryd ) based on the extrapolated far - uv synthetic spectrum for starburst galaxies derived in haehnelt et al .",
    "interestingly , this value is also consistent with estimates for the average quasar spectral index ( see the relevant discussion in sokasian et al .",
    "2002 ) , simplifying our analysis involving reionisation by harder sources such as agns ( see  5.4 ) . in this paper",
    "we adopt @xmath75 @xmath76 and @xmath77 @xmath76 from osterbrock ( 1989 ) .    to further simplify our calculations , we remove the coupling between the ionisation fractions of the two species by approximating separate expressions for the electron densities in each ionisation zone .",
    "specifically , ionisation fractions for he iii are computed first by approximating the medium within the he iii as fully ionised in he ii and h i , thus giving @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 represent the total hydrogen and helium particle densities , and @xmath81 is the ionisation fraction for he iii .",
    "ionisation fractions for h ii are then computed using @xmath82 where we have approximated @xmath83 based on our earlier assumptions related to the nature of the sources responsible for ionising hydrogen and singly ionising helium . again , since the helium abundance is small the latter approximation should be relatively accurate .",
    "although our procedure for calculating ionisation fractions is not fully consistent , the resultant inaccuracies are relatively small and certainly fall within the broader uncertainties associated with the simulation as a whole .",
    "the approximations listed above offer computational benefits that allow us to process a large number of sources easily . since they do not compromise the main objective of this paper , which is to study the morphological evolution of reionisation , we feel justified in adopting them .",
    "the cosmological simulation we will use in our analysis is based on a sph treatment of a @xmath84cdm model with parameters @xmath85 , @xmath86 , hubble constant @xmath87 km s@xmath61 mpc@xmath61 with @xmath88 , baryon density @xmath89 , and a scale - invariant primordial power spectrum with index n=1 , normalised to the abundance of rich galaxy clusters at the present day ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "these choices are in good agreement with those inferred from the wmap observations ( bennett et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the simulation uses @xmath91 sph particles and @xmath91 dark matter particles in a @xmath92 mpc comoving box , resulting in mass resolutions of @xmath93 m@xmath1 and @xmath94 m@xmath1 in the dark matter and gas components , respectively .",
    "this particular simulation represents one of the high - resolution runs ( simulation q5 ) in the series of calculations performed by springel & hernquist ( 2003a ) .",
    "these authors used a large set of high - resolution simulations on interlocking scales and at interlocking redshifts to infer the evolution of cosmic star formation from high redshift to the present .",
    "these simulations included a novel description for star formation and feedback processes within the interstellar medium and a treatment of galactic outflows ( springel & hernquist , 2003b ) , and employed a conservative formulation of sph based on following the specific entropy as independent thermodynamic variable ( springel & hernquist , 2002).the broad range of scales encompassed by their set of simulations , together with extensive convergence tests , enabled them to obtain a converged prediction for the cosmic star formation rate , @xmath95 , within the adopted model for galaxy formation .    in the following section we will discuss the motivation behind our particular choice for the simulation scale .",
    "we will also describe our methodology for selecting sources and assigning intensities in the context of the converged prediction for @xmath95 from springel & hernquist ( 2003a ) .",
    "to accurately simulate the reionisation process due to stellar sources , one requires the cosmological volume to be sufficiently large to properly sample a representative range of halo masses . at the same time , one is inhibited from adopting an excessively large volume which can compromise the technical feasibility of the simulation owing to the large number of sources which would need to be processed .",
    "furthermore , one requires sufficient mass resolution within the simulated volume in order to reliably measure star formation rates in galaxies .",
    "this is especially true at high redshifts , where the bulk of the star formation occurs in objects of relatively low mass , as expected for hierarchical growth of structure , making it important to resolve low - mass objects . from the set of simulation runs presented in springel & hernquist ( 2003a ) , we find that their q5 run provides the most appropriate compromise ( @xmath92 mpc box length ) , capable of capturing a representative sample of the halo population while maintaining a level of mass resolution that reliably matches the converged star formation rate .",
    "our approach for defining sources relies on identifying virialised halos as sites of star formation . as in springel & hernquist ( 2003a ) ,",
    "halos are located by employing a `` friends - of - friends '' ( fof ) group finder algorithm to the dark matter particles .",
    "the algorithm is restricted to dark matter particles only to avoid complications associated with tracking baryonic particles whose number and type can vary with time .",
    "the two main parameters which govern the group - finding algorithm are the comoving linking length and the minimum number of particles required for a group . for the former ,",
    "we choose a fixed value equal to 0.2 times the mean interparticle spacing of dark mater particles , corresponding to a group overdensity of roughly 200 .",
    "the choice for the minimum number of particles which can define a group is somewhat more arbitrary .",
    "this is due to the fact that this parameter is invariably related to the question as to what exactly constitutes a group .",
    "a reasonable definition may be that given a specific overdensity , a group is considered to be _ real _ if it can be reliablely tracked over time .",
    "more specifically , this would correspond to being able to find a given halo in a subsequent time step . below a certain threshold",
    ", one might start to identify _ transient _ groups , that dissolve away in subsequent time steps .",
    "our statistics on halo tracking indicate that this threshold is around 100 dark matter particles , with associated uncertainty growing progressively towards lower particle numbers ; i.e. below about 100 particles one starts to occasionally pick up transient halos that are probably flukes , and the fraction of these slowly grows towards smaller groups .",
    "however , as we shall show in the following section , a significant portion of the total star formation rate is predicted to come from low - mass halos with fewer than 100 dark matter particles .",
    "these objects essentially represent the star - forming mini - halos of the universe . in order to account for these sources ,",
    "we adopt an aggressively low minimum value of 16 particles for our definition of a group .",
    "this will inevitably raise the level of uncertainty regarding the reality of some of the low - mass halos and their corresponding star formation rates .",
    "however , this approach provides us with a list of low - mass objects whose number density and spatial locations are statistically consistent with results from simulations conducted with higher resolution .",
    "the star formation rates in these objects can then be systematically corrected so that the total contribution from all objects matches the converged result presented in springel & hernquist ( 2003a ) .",
    "our prescription for assigning star formation rates to the groups relies first on associating each gas or star particle with its nearest dark matter particle , and the fof - group this particle resides in .",
    "we then take the total mass of each group as a `` viral '' mass , and the sum of star formation rates in all of a group s sph particles as the total star formation rate in the halo .",
    "our working assumption will then be that every halo hosts a single galaxy which will act as a source . in reality , however , there may be more than one galaxy per halo .",
    "the difference , however , is negligible in the context of the spatial resolution of the radiative transfer calculations .",
    "more specifically , in the redshift range of interest , even the most massive halos have virial radii which are less than or comparable to the width of a single cell .    in figure 1",
    ", we plot various statistical quantities related to the star formation rate from the resultant source list as a function of halo mass for redshifts z = 14.7 , 10.4 , and 7.2 . at each redshift",
    "we have binned the halos by mass in logarithmic intervals of dlog@xmath96 = 0.1 and computed the associated star formation rate density , number density , fractional star formation contribution , and cumulative star formation contribution below a given mass . from the first two rows of plots ,",
    "it is evident that while the relative amplitude in the star formation rate becomes smaller towards the lower mass scales , the number of halos rises dramatically .",
    "note also the overall rise of the star formation rate with decreasing redshift . in hernquist & springel ( 2003 )",
    ", the authors used simple analytic reasoning to identify the physical processes that govern this evolution . as part of their conclusions",
    ", they find that at early times ( @xmath97 ) , densities are sufficiently high and cooling times are sufficiently short that abundant star - forming gas exists in all dark matter halos with @xmath98 that can cool by atomic line cooling .",
    "consequently , the evolution of the star formation rate is dominated by gravitationally driven growth of the halo mass function , as is seen here . the relative contribution to the total cosmic star formation rate density as a function of halo mass",
    "is shown in the bottom two rows of figure 1 . here",
    "we see that intermediate mass scales provide the largest contribution to the overall total , with a progressively larger contribution from higher mass scales at decreasing redshifts .",
    "owing to the finite dynamic range of the cosmological simulation , we can not expect to resolve _ all _ the star forming halos that contribute to the ionising emissivity .",
    "this becomes progressively problematic at high redshifts where most of the star formation takes place in low - mass galaxies which form in abundant numbers as progenitors of more massive systems .",
    "furthermore , near the resolution limit of identifiable halos , the corresponding star formation rate becomes less reliable owing to the relatively small number of sph particles associated with the halo .",
    "the resultant star formation missed by our simulation due to these resolution effects is shown in figure 2 for the redshift range of interest . in the top panel",
    "we plot the total star formation rate from all the halos identified in our simulation ( dashed line ) and compare it to the physically motivated analytic fit to numerical converged results presented in springel & hernquist ( 2003a ) .",
    "the analytic fit , obtained from the analysis of hernquist & springel ( 2003 ) , takes the form of @xmath99 where , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 m@xmath1 yr@xmath61 mpc@xmath61 define the fitting parameters .",
    "the above fitting function was motivated by the bimodal behaviour in the evolution of the cosmic star formation rate . at low redshifts ,",
    "the efficiency of gas cooling processes is diminished owing to the expansion of the universe and hence manifests itself through a scaling that is related to the expansion rate as quantified by the hubble constant . at high redshifts , the steep rise towards lower redshifts is related to the growth of the halo mass function which exhibits an exponential cut - off for large masses . to access the significance of the discrepancy between the numerical and the theoretical results in the context of the reionisation of the universe , we find it convenient to relate star formation rates in terms of the cumulative number of ionising photons released as a function of look - back time . in the bottom panel of figure 2",

    "the discrepancy described above does not pose a serious obstacle in the context of our present goals ; we find that we can easily correct for the missing star formation rate through a simple algorithm by adjusting the rates in the low - mass halos .",

    "the net effect from both these sets of sources is to cause a deficit in the total cosmic star formation rate relative to the theoretical expectation .",

    "we plot the comoving number densities and the star formation rates as a function of redshift for all the sources in the simulation . in the context of the deficit in the cosmic star formation rate",

    "it is evident from the plots that the corrections to the low - mass sources do not appear to be drastic and we are confident that the uncertainties related to these adjustments can not significantly affect our results .",
    "having adjusted star formation rates in the low - mass sources we can now estimate the magnitude of the discrepancies in the total star formation rate had we been limited to poorer mass resolutions . in figure 4",
    "( _ left panel _ )",
    "we plot this discrepancy in terms of the fraction of the total star formation contributed from sources with halo masses above a certain mass .",
    "the total star formation rate is based on all halos above the resolution limit in our simulation ( @xmath113 m@xmath1 ) . in the same figure ( _ right panel _ )",
    "we also plot source number densities as a function of redshift for the same mass ranges , with the total source density from the simulation also shown ( _ solid line _ ) . as in figure 1 , it is evident that the subsequent fraction of star formation contributed by relatively low - mass objects rises rapidly with redshift .",
    "the labeled mass inequalities were chosen to roughly match the source mass resolutions associated with recent numerical attempts to simulate igm reionisation by stellar sources ( see ciardi et al .",
    "2003b and razoumov et al .",
    "interestingly , we find that in the context of our corrected source list , the quoted mass limits continue to significantly underestimate the relative contribution to the total star formation rate from low - mass objects even at intermediate redshifts when the ionising emissivity in the igm is expected to have reached appreciable levels .",
    "in particular , at @xmath114 the cases with @xmath115 m@xmath1 and @xmath116 m@xmath1 , which are close to the mass resolution of sources in the m3 and s3 simulations described by ciardi et al .",
    "( 2003b ) , appear to account for only @xmath117 and @xmath118 of the total star formation rate , respectively , relative to our complete source list .",
    "it is of course possible to renormalise the star formation rates in the massive ( resolved ) sources so that the total star formation rate is corrected to agree with our converged results .",
    "however , such a simple correction fails to address the potentially significant impact the environments around sources can have on the amount of ionising radiation that can escape into the igm . in particular , by concentrating the ionising flux away from low mass system which are more likely to reside in less clumpy environments than their more massive counterparts , one runs the risk of systematically overestimating recombination rates .",
    "we will explore the ramifications from such corrections in context of our own results in  5.1 .      given the redshift range of interest , @xmath119 , and our time step for updating source lists , @xmath120 yrs , the total number of sources which require processing reaches nearly @xmath121 .",
    "since our radiative transfer calculations are performed on a cartesian grid with a limiting resolution , it is logical to group together sources within cells as a method of reducing the number of sources .",
    "owing to the high resolution of our grid ( @xmath122 ) , the overall number of sources is reduced only by @xmath123 .",
    "such a marginal reduction in sources assures us that the resolution of our grid provides excellent resolving power in regards to the spatial distribution of the sources .",
    "in our analysis , we carefully follow the reionisation process from a set of models parameterised by the escape fraction . in this context , the escape fraction is defined to be the fraction of ionising photons intrinsic to each source that escape and enter into the radiative transfer calculations .",
    "it must be noted here that this parameter inevitably also carries with it any uncertainties associated with the underlying amplitude of the star formation rates computed for the sources .",
    "nevertheless , our approach allows us to predict the epoch of reionisation as a function of this parameter . by comparing these predictions with recent observational constraints on the escape fractions and neutral densities near @xmath3 ,",
    "we are able to test the overall consistency of the theoretical predictions of the computed star formation rates . along the way we are also able to make general statements regarding the morphological aspects of reionisation .",
    "the evolution of the global ionisation fraction in the simulation volume provides a useful way of characterising the overall ionisation state of the universe as a function of redshift . in figures 5a and",
    "5b we show how the ionised mass - weighted and volume - weighted fraction , respectively , evolve with redshift .",
    "the rate of the evolution to a completely ionised state is quite similar for all the models , although there is a subtle trend towards a swallower rise of ionisation fractions with decreasing escape fractions .",
    "nevertheless , in all cases the reionisation epoch , which we define as the redshift when the global volume - weighted ionisation fraction reaches @xmath124 , occurs by @xmath125 . later in this section we show how a more detailed analysis involving statistical comparisons between simulated spectra and observational results for flux transmission at @xmath7 can lead to more rigid constraints as to how early reionisation could have taken place .",
    "figures 5a and 5b also show that the ionised mass - weighted fraction is consistently larger than the volume - weighted fraction at redshifts before reionisation .",
    "this result is seen more clearly in figure 5c where we have plotted the corresponding ratio of the two fractions .",
    "the larger values for the ionised mass - weighted fraction at early redshifts is consistent with the general picture of the pre - overlap epoch where sources are preferentially ionising their relatively dense surroundings before affecting the more tenuous igm .",
    "the fact that the inequality between the mass and volume fraction is amplified with decreasing escape fraction highlights an interesting morphological feature related to the number and intensity of the sources responsible for reionisation .",
    "namely , when escape fractions are low , a relatively larger number of sources are directly involved in the process of ionising a neutral density field .",
    "since the ionisation zones associated with these sources are also smaller , the net effect is that massive regions are more likely to be ionised from the ionising radiation emanating from within rather than radiation that has first traversed the less dense igm .",
    "this predilection naturally manifests itself in relatively larger ratios for the mass - to - volume ionisation fractions during the early stages of reionisation in these cases .",
    "eventually , intervening patches of neutral material become ionised and there is a sharp rise in the intensity of the ionising background as contributions from different sources combine . as this diffuse component comes to dominate the radiation field ,",
    "all regions become uniformly ionised and the ratio of mass - to - volume ionisation fraction converges to unity .",
    "a visual illustration of the reionisation process is shown in figure 6 where we plot a series of projected slices through the simulation volume . in each panel , a @xmath126mpc slice from the @xmath127 run is projected in both density and ionisation fraction .",
    "source locations in each slice are denoted by white crosses making it easier to follow how the ionised regions ( _ blue _ ) percolate to turn a neutral igm ( _ yellow _ ) into one that is highly ionised ( _ red _ ) .",
    "compared with earlier studies of reionisation , figure 6 shows that morphologically the ionised regions in our analysis trace the large scale distribution of sources . in particular , we do not find that reionisation occurs mainly from low- to high - density regions , as would be the case if photons escaped preferentially into the igm before ionising the high density regions near the sources .",
    "the panels in figure 6 graphically illustrate the large number of sources that are involved in the highly inhomogeneous reionisation process . a more dramatic illustration of this point is shown in figure 7 where we have plotted a 3d image of the same simulation showing iso - surfaces around the ionised regions at @xmath128 .",
    "this highly inhomogeneous morphology represents a departure from the general picture of reionisation proposed by gnedin ( 2000 ) where only a handful of bright sources are responsible for reionising the universe . in the following section",
    "we discuss how the morphology of the reionisation process can affect the number of ionising photons required to achieve full reionisation .",
    "the number of ionising photons per hydrogen atom required for the ionised regions around sources to completely overlap has developed into an interesting topic that is commonly addressed in studies of this kind ( ciardi et al .",
    "2003b , razoumov et al .",
    "2002 , haiman et al .",
    "2001 , miralda - escud et al .",
    "2000 , gnedin 2000 ) . to reliably estimate this quantity with simulations requires a high level of resolution capable of properly estimating gas clumping factors which govern the overall recombination rate .",
    "this requirement is especially important in light of the results presented in haiman et al .",
    "( 2001 ) which show that mini - halos with temperatures below @xmath129k can dominate the average clumping in the early stages of reionisation and significantly increase the required photon budget necessary to achieve complete overlap .",
    "given the high resolution inherent to our hydrodynamic simulations and the corresponding radiative transfer grids , coupled with our ability to probe clumping factors on sub - cell scales based on the underlying distribution of sph particles , we are able for the first time to probe the scales needed to account for recombination effects arising from such low - mass objects .",
    "this represents a significant improvement upon previous attempts which have relied on conservative assumptions related to the escape fraction to accommodate unresolved clumping .    in figure 8",
    ", we plot the cumulative number of escaping ionising photons per hydrogen atom as a function of redshift .",
    "the diamond symbol on each curve corresponding to different values for @xmath130 represents the point at which the volume ionisation fraction exceeds @xmath124 . for @xmath131 , between 2 and 3 ionising photons",
    "are required to reionise the universe while 4 - 5 ionising photons are needed in the case where @xmath132 .",
    "the difference in the number of required ionising photons resulting from variations in the escape fraction arises from the interesting interplay between the evolution of clumping factors and the mean density of the universe .",
    "in particular , the rapid evolution of the mean density plays a slightly more important role than the evolution of clumping factors in the redshift range of interest .",
    "therefore , a delay in reionisation to lower redshifts requires fewer ionising photons since the decline in gas densities outweighs the corresponding increase in clumping factors , resulting in comparatively fewer recombinations occurring than at higher redshifts .",
    "environmental factors influence the number of photons required to produce reionisation .",
    "a related issue is whether the distribution of ionising intensities among the sources themselves can also have an important impact on this process . in particular , given the same amplitude and evolution of the cosmic star formation rate , it is interesting to explore how a redistribution of the ionising flux from dim low - mass sources to more massive sources would affect reionisation . in figure 9 , we examine this scenario by way of comparisons involving the volume - weighted ionisation fraction and the cumulative number of ionising photons that are released .",
    "specifically , we examine two situations : 1 ) the case where we have retained the full source list which includes sources down to our resolution limit of @xmath133 m@xmath1 , and 2 ) the case where we have systematically transferred ionising fluxes from sources with @xmath134 m@xmath1 to the nearest neighbouring sources with masses above this limit .",
    "the figure shows that the affect can be significant , namely that reionisation takes place later and requires more photons ( by roughly @xmath135 ) for the same escape fraction ( @xmath11 ) when low - mass sources are excluded .",
    "this result stems from the fact that low - mass sources preferentially reside in less clumpy environments than their massive counterparts .",
    "consequently , the net effect of transferring ionising flux from these sources to more massive systems amounts to increasing the overall ionising intensity in regions with higher recombination rates .",
    "this leads to recombinations playing a more dominant role and thus delaying the onset of reionisation .",
    "this finding therefore supports the requirement that dim low - mass sources be properly resolved and included in future simulations of this kind . in particular , inaccuracies related to the inability to resolve low - mass sources and their corresponding contribution to the cosmic star formation rate may be amplified due to their preferential location in less clumpy environments .",

    "such an early reionisation epoch for helium by high redshift sources such as agns should be testable in the coming decade with the next generation space telescope .",

    "where sources with harder spectra such as agns are responsible for hydrogen reionisation , we have analysed a model in which the spectrum of sources is allowed to extend beyond 4 ryd . as a result , sources are able to reionise he ii simultaneously with h i. our analysis shows that helium reionisation occurs near @xmath182 when the spectrum is normalised to deliver the same number of h i ionising photons below 4 ryd as predicted from soft sources with @xmath11 . in a hypothetical case where these hard sources abruptly turn off before the onset of quasars below @xmath156 , we find that an early reionisation of the helium component is not necessarily in conflict with observational constraints of he ii opacities obtained at @xmath9 .",
    "this is due to the fact that by @xmath9 , enough he iii recombinations haven taken place to cause ionisation levels to converge to the values governed by quasar emissivities alone .    in this paper , we have focused on reionisation by stellar sources similar to those seen in local galaxies ; i.e. population ii type stars .",
    "our results show that the star - formation history inferred by springel & hernquist ( 2003a ) based on detailed hydrodynamic simulations can account for the properties of the igm measured from quasars at @xmath183 . to the extent that these comparisons are confirmed by future theoretical and observational studies ,",

    "cen ( 2002 ) has proposed a scenario in which the universe was reionised early by population iii stars , but then much of the igm recombined once these stars were no longer able to form , and the universe was reionised a second time by the next generation of stars .",

    "in an effort to study how this difference could be reconciled in the context of population ii type stars , we employed models with evolving escape fractions and found that if @xmath130 were to rise from @xmath11 near @xmath7 to @xmath12 near @xmath13 , the wmap and sdss constraints can both be satisfied . in this picture",
