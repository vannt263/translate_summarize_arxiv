    "neutrino mass and lepton mixing differs markedly from that of quarks in several ways .",
    "the extreme smallness of neutrino mass , together with large lepton mixing provide fascinating clues in the search for a theory of flavour .",
    "one idea is that lepton mixing may be governed by a discrete family symmetry group @xmath7 which controls the majorana neutrino and charged lepton mass matrices leading to lepton mixing predictions @xcite .",
    "the three possible implementations of flavour symmetries are known as `` direct '' , `` semi - direct '' and `` indirect ''  @xcite .    according to the `` direct '' approach , the klein symmetry @xmath8 of the majorana neutrino mass matrix and the symmetry @xmath9 which fixes the form of the lepton mass matrix are both subgroups of @xmath10 , resulting in a prediction for all the lepton mixing angles and dirac phase .",
    "the advantage of the direct approach is that the prediction arises purely from symmetry and does not require any detailed knowledge of the model .",
    "however , the direct approach requires a rather large group  @xcite , and the only viable mixing pattern is the trimaximal mixing , with @xmath4 being either zero or @xmath6 .    in the `` semi - direct '' approach ,",
    "the symmetry of the neutrino mass matrix is typically reduced to @xmath11 for majorana neutrinos , which constrains only the second column of the pmns matrix to be @xmath12 , or the first column to be @xmath13 ( up to phases ) , and the reactor angle @xmath14 can be accommodated with a small discrete group such as @xmath15 . in the `` indirect '' approach ,",
    "the flavour symmetry is completely broken such that the observed neutrino flavour symmetry emerges indirectly as an accidental symmetry , and the predictions are model dependent ( for a recent review see @xcite ) .",
    "the above direct and semi - direct approaches usually assume three non - degenerate majorana neutrino masses .",
    "there has recently been some discussion of how this picture changes if one of the majorana neutrino masses is zero @xcite . in this case",
    "the phase of the massless neutrino field is undetermined resulting in one of the @xmath11 factors being replaced by @xmath16 , with the consequence that the determinant of the family symmetry @xmath10 need not be @xmath17 , _ i.e. _  it is a subgroup of @xmath18 rather than @xmath19 .",
    "although this opens up the possibility that a new type of viable direct model being found , in fact only a no - go theorem results from such searches up to order 511 @xcite .    in the present paper we extend the reach of such searches for direct models with one massless neutrino up to order 1535 , but without phenomenological success .",
    "on the other hand we also perform a new type of search for semi - direct models up to order 1535 , and find a successful example of this kind , based on the group , @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the quaternion group of order 8 and the group is therefore of order @xmath22 .",
    "we denote this group as @xmath0 .",
    "this leads to a successful prediction for the first column of the pmns matrix , @xmath23 corresponding to a normal neutrino mass hierarchy with @xmath2 and sum rules for the mixing angles and phase which are characterised by the solar angle being on the low side @xmath3 and the dirac ( oscillation ) cp phase @xmath4 either about @xmath5 or @xmath6 ( e.g. the recent hint of @xmath24 is not allowed ) .",
    "before we outline the details of our analysis , we would like to briefly comment on dynamical settings enforcing @xmath2 .",
    "the most prominent scenarios of this kind are type - i seesaw models with two right - handed neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "such models necessarily imply the mass of the lightest neutrino to vanish , independent of any imposed flavour symmetries . in the same way , the discrete residual symmetries discussed in this paper lead to @xmath2 independent of the number of right - handed neutrino fields . therefore ,",
    "although not directly connected , the two approaches can easily be combined .",
    "for example if the three left - handed lepton doublets @xmath25 transform under a triplet representation  @xmath26 of the flavour group @xmath7 and three higgs - doublets ( or alternatively three flavons ) @xmath27 also transform under a triplet representation @xmath28 of @xmath7 , and the tensor product @xmath29 contains one or two - dimensional representations , a dirac yukawa coupling @xmath30 to two right - handed neutrinos is compatible with @xmath7 .    the remainder of the paper is laid out as follows . in section 2",
    "we review residual symmetries with a massless majorana neutrino and describe our strategy and results of group searches for direct and indirect models , for groups up to order 1535 . in section 3",
    "we present the results of a numerical phenomenological analysis , and show that while the direct models are excluded by current data , there is a unique group ( up to this order ) which yields acceptable results in the semi - direct approach , leading to mixing sum rules and phenomenological predictions .",
    "section 4 concludes the paper .",
    "the main question around which the framework of residual symmetries in the fermion mass matrices  @xcite has been constructed is the question : _ when do symmetries of a @xmath31-matrix ( partly ) fix the matrix which diagonalises it ? _    the answer to this question is fairly simple .",
    "consider unitary matrices @xmath32 and @xmath33 which leave a complex symmetric matrix @xmath34 or a hermitian matrix @xmath35 invariant , and @xmath36 . ]",
    "_ i.e. _    @xmath37    the set of all matrices @xmath32 forms a group @xmath38 of unitary @xmath31-matrices . in the same way , also the matrices @xmath33 form a unitary group @xmath39 . if the matrices @xmath34 and @xmath35 have non - degenerate singular values will be identified with the charged - lepton masses squared and the singular values of @xmath34 will be identified with the three light - neutrino masses . ] the groups @xmath38 and @xmath39 must be _",
    "abelian_. for this case one can show that the matrices @xmath40 and @xmath41 which ( simultaneously ) bring all @xmath32 and @xmath33 to diagonal form , _ i.e. _",
    "@xmath42    also diagonalise @xmath35 and @xmath34 via . from equation  ( [ diag_m ] ) we have @xmath43 ( no summation over @xmath44 ) for the columns",
    "@xmath45 of @xmath40 , _",
    "i.e. _  the @xmath45 are singular vectors of @xmath34 with singular values @xmath46 . from equation  ( [ symmetries_nu ] ) we then have @xmath47 since the singular values @xmath48 are assumed to be non - degenerate , the corresponding singular vectors are unique up to multiplication with a constant , _",
    "i.e. _  @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath45 are simultaneous eigenvectors to all @xmath32 , which implies equation  ( [ diag_s ] ) . ]",

    "_ the set of symmetries @xmath32 of a matrix @xmath34 fixes its diagonalising matrix @xmath40 .",
    "_ the same statement holds for @xmath33 and @xmath35 .",
    "let us now apply these mathematical considerations to the case of residual symmetries in the lepton sector .",
    "the assumption of residual symmetries is that there is a flavour symmetry group @xmath7 ( acting on the lepton fields ) which is spontaneously broken to a symmetry group @xmath51 in the neutrino sector , @xmath52 and a symmetry group @xmath9 in the charged - lepton sector , @xmath53 identifying @xmath54 and @xmath36 in the above discussion , we immediately find @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , the symmetry groups @xmath9 and @xmath51 potentially ( but not necessarily ) impose constraints on the matrices @xmath57 and @xmath58 , which diagonalise @xmath59 and @xmath60 via @xmath61 and consequently also on the mixing matrix @xmath62 .    in order to know how @xmath51 and @xmath9 constrain @xmath57 and @xmath58 we have to understand to which degree",

    "only one element of @xmath68 would be fixed . due to its low predictive power , this scenario is usually not studied , and also we will not study it here .",

    "we have found 22 groups of order smaller than 1536 fulfilling the minimal criteria .",
    "they are shown in equation  ( [ groups - massless ] ) in appendix  [ appa ] .",
    "let us now investigate the requirements for direct models enforcing a massless neutrino .",
    "the requirement for the charged - lepton sector is the usual one : any group @xmath9 which uniquely determines the diagonalising matrix @xmath58 is sufficient .",
    "the same also holds for semidirect models of type  b1 . in the neutrino sector",
    ", we require a residual symmetry group @xmath51 which completely fixes @xmath57 ( as always up to rephasing and reordering of the columns ) and which enforces one neutrino mass to vanish .",
    "the requirement of a vanishing neutrino mass implies that @xmath51 is a subgroup of @xmath80 instead of @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , there exists a basis in which all elements of @xmath51 have the form @xmath82 with @xmath83 , @xmath84 . moreover , in order to enforce a vanishing neutrino mass , for at least one element of @xmath51 we must have @xmath85 .",
    "this element may be of four forms : @xmath86 every group @xmath51 capable of fixing the complete matrix @xmath57 and enforcing a massless neutrino contains at least one element of the form @xmath87 or @xmath88 .",
    "namely , if it did not contain such an element , in order to fulfill all requirements it would have to contain at least one element of the form @xmath89 and one further element with non - degenerate 22 and 33 elements , _ _",
    "i.e.__@xmath90 however , the product of the matrices of equations  ( [ seq1 ] ) and  ( [ seq2 ] ) is of the form @xmath87 or @xmath88 , which proves that @xmath51 always contains an element of this form .",
    "the matrices @xmath87 and @xmath88 , since they have non - degenerate eigenvalues , on their own already fix the complete matrix @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , we can restrict the analysis to groups @xmath91 generated by @xmath87 ( or @xmath92 generated by @xmath88 . )",
    "means `` generated by @xmath93 '' . ]",
    "thus , the requirement on @xmath7 is :    * @xmath7 has a faithful three - dimensional irreducible representation which has at least one element with one eigenvalue @xmath94 , one eigenvalue @xmath95 and one eigenvalue @xmath96 .",
    "this element generates the residual symmetry group @xmath97 ( @xmath79 even ) and determines @xmath57 up to rephasing and reordering of the columns .",
    "thus , among the groups of equation  ( [ groups - massless ] ) we search for those which have a faithful three - dimensional irreducible representation * * ( defining a matrix group @xmath98 isomorphic to @xmath7 ) fulfilling the following criteria :    * @xmath98 contains a matrix @xmath99 with eigenvalues @xmath100 , @xmath94 .",
    "this is a basis independent property and may easily be checked by testing @xmath101 , @xmath102 .",

    "* moreover , the groups @xmath104 and @xmath103 must together generate the whole matrix group @xmath98 .",

    "if @xmath107 is reducible , the mixing matrix has two vanishing mixing angles and is therefore not compatible with experiment .",
    "performing a group search with gap , we find that only seven groups of order smaller than 1536 fulfill all these criteria : @xmath108 , [ 324 , 111 ] , [ 432 , 239 ] , [ 648 , 533 ] , [ 864 , 675 ] , [ 972 , 411 ] , [ 1296 , 1995 ] .\\ ] ]      the requirements for semidirect models of type  ( b1 ) are identical with only two differences :    * the requirement on @xmath99 now becomes : @xmath98 contains a matrix @xmath99 with eigenvalues @xmath109 , @xmath94 , respectively ( _ i.e. _  two degenerate eigenvalues in each case ) .",
    "this ensures that one mass is set to zero , but only one column of @xmath57 is fixed . *",
    "the argument used to prove that none of the generators of @xmath9 must commute with the generator @xmath99 of @xmath51see appendix  [ appb]does not hold for semidirect models .",
    "thus , one of the generators of @xmath104 is allowed to commute with @xmath99 .",
    "also for the semidirect case the groups @xmath104 and @xmath103 have to generate the full group @xmath98 . however , the argument for this is different to the case of direct models . again ,",
    "if @xmath107 is irreducible , we may replace @xmath7 by @xmath107 .",
    "if @xmath107 is reducible one can ( by the same argument as used in appendix  [ appa ] to show that @xmath98 must be irreducible ) show that a reducible @xmath107 leads to predictions incompatible with experiment .",
    "doing a group search with gap , one finds that there is only one single group of order smaller than 1536 which meets all requirements for a semidirect model .",
    "this group has the identification number @xmath110 $ ] in the smallgroups library .",
    "in order to test the seven candidate groups for direct models with a massless neutrino , we computed all faithful three - dimensional irreducible representations of the groups , computed all abelian subgroups and listed all possible combinations @xmath111 . for each of these combinations ,",
    "the possible mixing matrices have been computed ",
    "see  @xcite for a detailed description of this procedure . in order to compare the predictions for the mixing matrix with experiment we fitted the three mixing angles to the global fit data of  @xcite . as @xmath112-function we used @xmath113 which has three degrees of freedom . for the errors",
    "@xmath114 we used the values given in  @xcite ( in case of an asymmetric error distribution we used the larger error ) .",

    "it has six faithful three - dimensional irreducible representations , each of which can predict ( the same ) 19 different patterns for a column of the mixing matrix .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to study only one of the faithful three - dimensional irreducible representations constructed with gap , _",
    "i.e. _  we pick one of them and use it to define the group @xmath110 $ ] as a matrix group . in this representation",
