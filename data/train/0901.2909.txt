    "one of the major goals of ultrarelativistic nuclear collision studies is to obtain information on the qcd phase diagram @xcite .",
    "a promising approach is the investigation of hadron production .",
    "hadron yields measured in central heavy ion collisions from ags up to rhic energies can be described very well @xcite within a hadro - chemical equilibrium model . in our approach",
    "@xcite the only parameters are the chemical freeze - out temperature @xmath3 and the baryo - chemical potential @xmath4 ( and the fireball volume @xmath5 , in case yields rather than ratios of yields are fitted ) ; for a review see @xcite .",
    "the main result of these investigations was that the extracted temperature values rise rather sharply from low energies on towards @xmath610 gev and reach afterwards constant values near @xmath3=160 mev , while the baryochemical potential decreases smoothly as a function of energy .",
    "the limiting temperature @xcite behavior suggests a connection to the phase boundary and it was , indeed , argued @xcite that the quark - hadron phase transition drives the equilibration dynamically , at least for sps energies and above .",
    "considering also the results obtained for elementary collisions , where similar analyses of hadron multiplicities , albeit with several additional , non - statistical parameters ( see @xcite and refs . therein ) , yield also temperature values in the range of 160 mev , alternative interpretations were put forward .",
    "these include conjectures that the thermodynamical state is not reached by dynamical equilibration among constituents but rather is a generic fingerprint of hadronization @xcite , or is a feature of the excited qcd vacuum @xcite .",
    "the results presented below lend further support to the interpretation that the phase boundary is reflected in features of the hadron yields .    while in general all hadron yields are described rather quantitatively , a notable exception was up - to - now the energy dependence of the @xmath2 ratio which exhibits a rather marked maximum , `` the horn '' @xcite , near @xmath6 10 gev @xcite",
    ". predicted first within a model of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation @xcite , the existence of such a maximum was also predicted @xcite within the framework of the statistical model , but the observed rather sharp structure could not be reproduced @xcite .",
    "other attempts to describe the energy dependence of the @xmath2 ratio within the thermal model @xcite were also not successful , except when an energy - dependent light quark fugacity was used as an additional parameter @xcite .",
    "furthermore , all attempts to reproduce this structure within the framework of hadronic cascade models also failed , as is discussed in detail in @xcite . as a consequence , the horn structure is taken in @xcite as experimental evidence for the onset of deconfinement and qgp formation , and as support for the predictions of @xcite .",
    "we have recently shown @xcite that , employing an improved hadronic mass spectrum , in which the @xmath1 meson @xcite and many higher - lying resonances are included , leads to an increase of about 16% for the calculated pion yields .",
    "this increase levels off near the point where the temperature reaches its limiting value , thereby sharpening the structure in the @xmath2 ratio , as will be shown below . for the @xmath7 hyperons ,",
    "the new high mass resonances lead to an increase in the calculated production of about 22% .",
    "an increase of up to 6% is observed for protons , while for kaons this increase is about 7% .",
    "we employ the above parametrizations of @xmath3 and @xmath4 to investigate the energy dependence of the production yields of various hadrons relative to pions , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_k2pi ] .",
    "in particular , the @xmath2 ratio shows a rather pronounced maximum at a beam energy of 30 agev @xcite , and the data are well reproduced by the model calculations . in the thermal model",
    "this maximum occurs naturally at @xmath68 gev @xcite .",
    "it is due to the counteracting effects of the steep rise and saturation of @xmath3 and the strong monotonous decrease in @xmath4 .",
    "the competing effects are most prominently reflected in the energy dependence of the @xmath7 hyperon to pion ratio ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_k2pi ] ) , which shows a pronounced maximum at @xmath65 gev .",
    "this is reflected in the @xmath2 ratio somewhat less directly ; it appears mainly as a consequence of strangeness neutrality , assumed in our calculations .",
    "the model describes the @xmath2 data very well over the full energy range , as a consequence of the inclusion in the code of the high - mass resonances and of the @xmath1 meson , while our earlier calculations @xcite were overpredicting the sps data . at rhic energies ,",
    "the quality of the present fits is essentially unchanged compared to @xcite , as also the data have changed somewhat .",
    "the model also describes accurately the @xmath8 measurements as well as those for other hyperons .",
    "we note that the maxima in the various production ratios are located at different energies @xcite .",
    "the model calculations reproduce this feature in detail .",
    "the calculated @xmath2 ratio is likely to decrease further at energies beyond the maximum and the peak is likely to sharpen somewhat @xcite if our presumably still incomplete knowledge of the hadronic spectrum for masses larger than 2 gev would improve .",
    "the uncertainty of the calculations due to the mass and width of the @xmath1 meson are at the percent level only .",
    "another few percent uncertainty , which is difficult to assess quantitatively , arises from the unknown branching ratios of the high - mass resonances .    in summary , our results",
    "@xcite demonstrate that by inclusion of the @xmath1 meson and many higher mass resonances into the resonance spectrum employed in the statistical model calculations an improved description is obtained of hadron production in central nucleus - nucleus collisions at ultra - relativistic energies .",
    "a dramatic improvement is visible for the @xmath2 ratio , which is now well described at all energies .",
    "the `` horn '' finds herewith a natural explanation which is , however , deeply rooted in and connected to detailed features of the hadronic mass spectrum which leads to a limiting temperature and contains the qcd phase transition @xcite .",
    "our results strongly imply that hadronic observables near and above the horn structure at a beam energy of 30 agev provide a link to the qcd phase transition .",
    "open questions are whether the chemical freeze - out curve below the horn energy actually traces the qcd phase boundary at large values of chemical potential or whether chemical freeze - out in this energy range is influenced by exotic new phases such as have been predicted in @xcite . in any case",
    "these are exciting prospects for new physics to be explored at rhic low energy runs and , in particular , at the high luminosity fair facility . at the high energy frontier",
    ", the measurements at lhc will be a crucial test of the present picture .",
