    "in this paper we discuss the measurement of the w mass from direct reconstruction of the invariant mass of the decay products in the channels ww@xmath3qqqq ( 4q ) and ww@xmath4qq .",
    "preliminary results are presented for data collected in aleph@xcite during 1998 with an integrated luminosity of 174.2@xmath5 at 188.63gev .",
    "events are preselected to remove radiative returns to the z and clustered into four jets using the ` durham - pe ` algorithm , defining @xmath6 .",
    "events are vetoed if a charged track in a jet carries more than 90% of the jet energy or if there is more than 95% of electromagnetic energy in a @xmath7 cone around any particle .",
    "a neural network with fourteen input variables ( nn14 ) is used to perform the final selection .",
    "training is performed with an independent sample of the standard monte - carlo ( ` koralw`@xcite hadronised with ` jetset`@xcite ) and comparable samples of qq@xmath8 and zz events , both generated using ` pythia`@xcite , to simulate the background .",
    "events with nn@xmath9 are used to extract the w mass@xcite .",
    "the total charged energy and multiplicity are used to preselect events with a further cut on the total longitudinal momentum and visible energy to remove radiative returns to the z. the lepton candidates are chosen to be more energetic and isolated than the other charged tracks and are identified as an electron or muon in the detector .",
    "the energy of electron candidates are corrected for possible bremsstrahlung photons detected in the electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "the ` durham - pe ` algorithm is used to force two jets from objects not used to reconstruct the lepton defining @xmath12 .",
    "a probability for an event to come from a signal process is determined from monte carlo reference samples using the lepton energy and isolation and the event total transverse momentum .",
    "selected events are required to have a probability greater than 0.4 .",
    "a similar preselection to that used for electron and muon events is applied with additional constraints to remove events with i ) energy around the beam line , ii ) isolated , energetic photons and iii ) those already selected as electron or muon candidate events .",
    "a tau jet is constructed from one or three charged tracks and two other jets are forced using the ` jade ` algorithm .",
    "the tau jet must be that jet most anti - parallel to the missing momentum vector and isolated from the other jets . as with electron and muon candidate events , a probability is calculated and the same cut applied .",
    "to improve the invariant mass resolution a four constraint kinematic fit is applied to the four jets to conserve energy ( as provided by lep ) and momention .",
    "corrections are applied to the jets to take into account particle losses in the detector .",
    "the masses from the three combinations of di - jets formed from the fitted jets are rescaled according to @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the measured jet energies .",
    "a pairing algorithm is applied to the di - jet combinations to select that which most closely corresponds to a ww pair .",
    "the combination with the smallest mass difference between rescaled masses is chosen provided one mass lies in the window 60 to 86 gev/@xmath2 and the other 74 to 86 gev/@xmath2 .",
    "a binned monte - carlo reweighting procedure is employed to find the value of @xmath0 which best fits the mass distributions .",
    "events from a ` koralw`@xcite sample with equivalent background are reweighted with a cc03 matrix element to provide a two - dimensional probability density function for the minimisation using a single parameter , @xmath0 .",
    "variable binning controlled by the density of monte - carlo is employed optimised to produce a stable result .",
    "the w - width is allowed to vary with @xmath0 according to the standard model .    in order to check that the procedure does not introduce any biases ,",
    "monte carlo samples are generated with @xmath0 in the range 79.35 and 81.35 gev/@xmath2 . treating these samples as data , no significant offsets in the masses measured are found .",
    "a two constraint fit@xcite is applied to each event by minimising a @xmath18 constructed from the deviations of selected parameters of the jets and leptons from their true values and demanding that the hadron and lepton invariant masses are equal .",
    "the single fitted mass obtained for each event must lie in the window 74 to 94.5 gev/@xmath2 .    a reweighting procedure similar to that employed in the four quark channel is used to fit the mass distribution .",
    "fixed binning is used for the electron and muon channels and variable binning is retained for the tau channel .",

    "uncertainties due to the detector are determined using data taken at the z at intervals during the high energy running .",
    "particles not seen by the detector cause discrepancies in the jet finding , the effect is estimated by matching jets built from monte carlo tracks before and after passing them through the detector simulation .",
    "the error due to parton fragmentation effects is measured by determining the mass shift when ` herwig`@xcite rather than ` jetset ` is used for hadronisation .",
