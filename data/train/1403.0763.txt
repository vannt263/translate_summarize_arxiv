    "the neutron stars are believed to have surface magnetic field as large as @xmath2 g ( magnetar model ) @xcite and hence their interior field ( @xmath3 ) could even be a few orders of magnitude higher , say @xmath4 g @xcite , where the density is also higher . on the other hand , for white dwarfs with typical radius ( @xmath5 km ) , the maximum @xmath3 could be restricted to @xmath6 g from the scalar virial theorem . however , for the recently proposed high density white dwarfs having highly tangled / fluctuating magnetic field with radius , e.g. , @xmath7 km , @xmath8 g @xcite . such smaller white dwarfs central density ( @xmath9 ) is @xmath10gm / cc and hence quite above the non - magnetic threshold density of neutronization .",
    "all the above facts motivate us to formulate the present work and to study the effect of ( high ) magnetic field on neutronization and neutron drip for the degenerate fermions at high densities",
    ". this will be helpful to interpret the detailed spectra of cooling neutron stars , radio emission and @xmath11ray burst from neutron stars . at such high density regions of neutron stars and white dwarfs , the mean fermi energy and the cyclotron energy of an electron",
    "exceed its rest - mass energy ; for the latter condition to hold , the magnetic field needs to be sufficiently high , making the electrons relativistic .",
    "we know that inverse @xmath12decay can occur when the energy of electrons becomes higher than the difference between the rest mass energies of neutron and proton .",
    "such a condition is expected to be modified in the presence of magnetic field which we plan to explore here at zero temperature .",
    "effects of magnetic field to the neutron star matter were investigated earlier in different contexts .",
    "for example , the enhancement of electron and neutron densities in the inner and outer crusts of neutron stars was discussed in the presence of high magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the authors adopted the thomas fermi model for their calculations and one of the motivations was to understand the transport phenomena within magnetars .",
    "based on fully self - consistent covariant density functional theory , the influence of strong magnetic fields on nuclear structure has been studied in the context of magnetars @xcite .",
    "these authors showed that a field strength @xmath1 g , which presumably corresponds to the central / crust field of magnetars , appreciably modifies the nuclear ground state .",
    "hence , the composition of the magnetar crust might be radically different from that of normal neutron stars which might have significant implications to various related properties , such as pulsar glitches , cooling etc .",
    "other authors investigated numerically the variations of composition and pressure at the onset of neutron drip with the magnetic field @xcite , which we will recall in  3 again for comparison with the present work .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following .",
    "in the next section , we discuss the neutronization density in a neutron - proton - electron ( @xmath13 ) gas .",
    "subsequently , in  3 we derive the neutron drip density in a system with heavier ions .",
    "finally , we end with a summary in  4 .",
    "the system is neutral in charge and , hence , the number densities of electrons and protons are same .",
    "the generic condition for the initiation of inverse @xmath12decay and hence neutronization is chemical equilibrium given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 are the fermi energies for electron , proton and neutron respectively given by @xmath16 and @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the masses of electron , proton and neutron respectively , @xmath19 are the magnetic fields in the units of respective critical fields @xmath20 g and @xmath21 g , for electrons and protons respectively , @xmath22 are the occupied landau levels in the respective energies , @xmath23 is the fermi momentum of electrons and protons , @xmath24 is the fermi momentum of neutrons and @xmath25 is the speed of light .",
    "the neutronization density for this system was investigated by previous authors @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , here we discuss the results categorically .",
    "let us consider three possible cases , some of them may turn out to be absurd .    [",
    "[ case - i - pf2c2delta_ep ] ] case i : @xmath26 : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    this happens when both protons and electrons are highly relativistic . at the beginning of formation of neutrons ( and",
    "hence the corresponding momentum is zero ) , from eqn .",
    "( [ chem ] ) we obtain @xmath27 which however violates initial choice as @xmath28 .",
    "hence , this situation is unphysical to reveal the neutronization .    [ [ case - ii - pf2c2simdelta_pdelta_e ] ]",
    "case ii : @xmath29 : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    this happens when electrons are highly relativistic but protons are just becoming relativistic . from eqn .",
    "( [ chem ] ) the initiation of neutronization occurs at @xmath30 which , however , turns out to be negative unless @xmath31 .",
    "however , this corresponds to @xmath32 which can not reveal relativistic protons .",
    "hence , this case is unphysical .",
    "[ [ case - iii - pf2c2simdelta_edelta_p ] ] case iii : @xmath33 : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    this corresponds to relativistic electrons but nonrelativistic protons , which reads eqn .",
    "( [ chem ] ) as @xmath34 at the neutronization , revealing further @xmath35 when the fermi energy and magnetic field of the system are such that the electrons lie in the ground landau level only ( with @xmath36 ) and the protons are not affected by the magnetic field ( with @xmath37 ) , the neutronization density @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the charge of electrons and @xmath40 the planck s constant",
    "( [ rel11 ] ) implies that the neutronization density increases linearly with the magnetic field and for the increment to be at least an order of magnitude compared to the nonmagnetic case , the magnetic field @xmath41 has to be @xmath2 g .",
    "however , beyond neutronization , the chemical equilibrium eqn .",
    "( [ chem ] ) gives @xmath42 where we have assumed that all the electrons reside in the ground landau level and for this to be true , @xmath43 ( see @xcite ) , and the protons are not affected by the chosen value of magnetic field .",
    "+ therefore , the density beyond neutronization is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45.\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath46 is the number density of electrons ( which is also the number density of protons ) , @xmath47 is the energy density of neutrons , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the compton wavelengths of the electron and neutron respectively and @xmath50 . now",
    ". expresses @xmath23 in terms of @xmath24 .",
    "hence @xmath51 varies as a function of @xmath52 for a given @xmath53 , as shown in fig .",
    "the results of this section are mostly applicable for neutron stars and maybe for white dwarfs with heavier ion(s ) .",
    "we adopt the harrison - wheeler formalism @xcite in describing the equilibrium composition of nuclear matter .",
    "we do not include the shell effects in the model , as they have a negligible effect on the density of the system .",
    "here we intend to determine the variation in the density at the onset of drip with the variation in magnetic field .",
    "hence , the lattice energy effects can be neglected , as they have a significant influence only on the composition of the system and an even lesser influence on the pressure .",
    "they do not alter the density of the mixture @xcite .",
    "moreover , the harrison - wheeler model has the added advantage of allowing one to obtain a purely analytical relation between the drip density and the field strength , as we shall show below .",
    "previous authors obtained a relation between the field and drip pressure ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , however purely in numerical computations .",
    "their results have the disadvantage that the drip pressure versus magnetic field relation is obtained numerically at discreet values of the field with reasonably large intervals .",
    "this kills an important physics revealing oscillations of the drip density at the lower values of field , which we address below in detail in our analysis .",
    "moreover , they considered only a limited range of fields while studying the drip pressure variation . whereas we investigate the density for a wide range of field strengths so as to understand the regimes where there is a significant change in the drip density .",
    "we assume that given enough time , following nuclear burning , cold catalyzed material will achieve complete thermodynamic equilibrium . the matter composition and equation of state",
    "will then be determined by the lowest possible energy state of the matter .",
    "the constituents of the matter are assumed to be ions , free electrons and free neutrons and the drip density is obtained by finding the density of the equilibrium composition , when the neutron number density is zero ( neutrons just start appearing ) .",
    "we further assume the strong magnetic field present in the matter is constant throughout .",
    "we then obtain the equilibrium density by minimizing the energy density of the mixture with respect to the number densities of the ions , electrons and neutrons .",
    "due to the presence of the magnetic field , the electrons are landau quantized but the field of present interest ( say , upto the value which a neutron star core could plausibly have ) is small enough so that it does not affect the ions .",
    "now we proceed to establish our results .",
    "note that for the convenience of the readers , we follow the well - known textbook by shapiro & teukolsky @xcite in developing our results , which discusses the non - magnetic results in detail .",
    "the total energy density of the system can be written as @xmath54 here @xmath55 is the energy of a single ion @xmath56 , including the rest mass energy , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are atomic mass and atomic number respectively .",
    "it is conventional to include the rest mass energy of the electrons in the energy of the ions ( see , e.g. , @xcite for details of non - magnetic results ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath59 is the energy density of the electrons after subtracting @xmath60 from the total energy density @xmath61 and @xmath47 is the total energy density of neutrons .",
    "the system is neutral in charge .",
    "the number densities @xmath62 , @xmath46 and @xmath63 , of ions , electrons and neutrons respectively , and the total baryon number density @xmath64 are related as @xmath65 these can be written in terms of mean numbers per baryon as @xmath66 where @xmath67 .",
    "hence at @xmath68 , we can write @xmath69 as a function of either @xmath70 or @xmath71 .",
    "the equilibrium composition is obtained by minimizing @xmath69 with respect to @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath72 for a constant @xmath64 .",
    "we use the semi - empirical mass formula of green @xcite based on the liquid drop nuclear model @xmath73,\\ ] ] where @xmath74 and @xmath75gm ( 1 amu ) .",
    "hence eqn . becomes @xmath76 moreover , @xmath77 now we approximate @xmath57 and @xmath58 as continuous variables and equations for equilibrium compositions can be found from eqns . and",
    "as @xmath78 @xmath79 and finally @xmath80    now combining eqns . and , we obtain @xmath81 eqns . and also give @xmath82m_uc^2&=&e^f_e - m_ec^2\\label{electron},\\label{elec}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath83m_uc^2&=&e^f_n , \\label{neutron}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 , and at the onset of neutron drip , @xmath85 when the number density of neutron is just zero .",
    "therefore , at the onset of drip , eqn .",
    "can be written as @xmath86 solving eqns . and",
    ", we obtain @xmath87 for the onset of drip . using these values for @xmath57 and @xmath58",
    ", we can obtain the electron fermi energy at the drip from eqn .",
    "as @xmath88 figure [ fermi - a ] shows , combining eqns .",
    "( [ equation1 ] ) and ( [ elec ] ) , that beyond drip , @xmath89 first increases with the increase of @xmath57 and subsequently saturates to a value @xmath90 at a large @xmath57",
    ". however , a large @xmath57 at a high magnetic field corresponds to a value of @xmath89 and then density well within the maximum possible central density of a neutron star .",
    "for example , at @xmath91 ( and hence the magnetic field @xmath92 g ) , @xmath93 corresponds to a density @xmath94gm / cc , whereas the corresponding nonmagnetic @xmath95gm / cc .",
    "this clearly indicates the huge effects of magnetic field in the matter .",
    "higher values of @xmath96 and @xmath97 , at the same magnetic field , correspond to @xmath98gm / cc and @xmath99gm / cc respectively  all are within the typical nuclear matter density @xmath100gm / cc .",
    "hence , highly magnetized neutron stars may exhibit atomic structures with large @xmath57 .",
    "the fermi energy of a landau quantized electron with magnetic field strength @xmath41 confined in @xmath101 levels can be rewritten as @xmath102^{1/2 } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath103 is @xmath104-component of the fermi momentum of the electron .",
    "therefore , from eqn .",
    "let us now determine the number of states occupied by the landau quantized electrons @xcite .",
    "this is given by @xmath106 where @xmath107 the degeneracy factor which is @xmath108 .",
    "the upper limit @xmath109 in the summation is obtained from the condition that @xmath110 , which gives @xmath111    the electron energy density at zero temperature is then @xcite @xmath112 where @xmath113 the density of the mixture of ions and electrons at the onset of drip is therefore @xmath114 now eqn . gives @xmath115 as a function of @xmath116 .",
    "therefore , the above equation gives us a relationship between @xmath117 and @xmath116 .",
    "note that for @xmath118 , @xmath36 and hence @xmath115 becomes independent of @xmath41 , which renders @xmath46 to be linear in @xmath116 in eqn .",
    "( [ nee ] ) .",
    "indeed , fig .",
    "[ ionfig ] shows that for @xmath119 g , drip density increases linearly with magnetic field .",
    "this linearity arises due to the fact that beyond a certain @xmath116 , the landau quantized electrons reside in the ground state energy level .",
    "we also notice that before the onset of linearity , the drip density oscillates about the non - magnetic result , with small amplitudes .",
    "a significant change in the drip density arises only in the linear regime .",
    "for instance , the drip density increases by an order , compared to that of the nonmagnetic gas , for a field @xmath120 g .    for completeness",
    ", we also provide in fig .",
    "[ eos ] the equation of states ( eoss ) of magnetized nuclear matter for different values of ( fixed ) magnetic field and compare them with the nonmagnetic eos .",
    "all the eoss are plotted starting from the density corresponding to @xmath121 . however , for a very high @xmath41 ( here @xmath91 ) , the corresponding density increases noticeably compared to that of a lower @xmath41 and hence the corresponding eos begins from a larger density , as shown in fig .",
    "we have studied the effects of magnetic field on the onsets of neutronization for @xmath13 and neutron drip for ion - electron gas systems .",
    "we have found that beyond a certain value of magnetic field , the neutronization / drip density of either of the systems increases , compared to the nonmagnetic cases , linearly with the magnetic field .",
    "this value of field for the former is @xmath122 and for the latter @xmath123 .",
    "the significant change in the drip density arises only in the linear regime .",
    "for instance , the drip density for the ionic system increases by an order , compared to that of the nonmagnetic gas , for a field @xmath120 g .    apart from the various applications to neutron stars , the present findings may have interesting consequences to the recently proposed high density ( @xmath124gm / cc ) , high magnetic field ( @xmath0 g ) white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the inner region of white dwarfs , in particular for @xmath8 g , would have been neutronized if the drip density had not been changed with the field .",
    "note that some authors have questioned the existence of such white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "for example , the authors have argued that for the white dwarfs to be stable against neutronization , the magnetic field at the center should be less than few times @xmath125 g for typical matter compositions .",
    "however , as discussed in detail in @xcite ( also see @xcite ) , for the central field @xmath126 g , the mass of the said highly magnetized white dwarfs already becomes significantly super - chandrasekhar with the value @xmath127 solar mass .",
    "therefore , such super - chandrasekhar white dwarfs remain stable according to the neutronization limit given by the same authors only .",
    "even if the white dwarfs with very large field consist of central region with density larger than the modified drip density , the present finding will help in putting a constraint on such models of white dwarfs with pure electron degenerate matter .",
