    "the investigation of single - photon properties has experienced an increasing interest over the last years @xcite .",
    "one of the reasons has to be sought in the escalating request , in many quantum information and cryptography protocols @xcite , for highly accurate manipulations of spatial and polarization single - photon properties .",
    "the most appropriate description of single - photon observables is the subject of an ongoing debate .",
    "photon position , in particular , has been considered a controversial concept since t.d .",
    "newton and e.p .",
    "wigner first stated @xcite that no position operator can be defined in the usual sense for particles with mass @xmath1 .",
    "later , a.s .",
    "wightman @xcite extended the search for a notion of photon localization based on a projection - valued measure ( pvm ) , again obtaining a negative result .",
    "this evidence suggested k. kraus to define the single - photon position observable as a positive- operator valued measure ( povm ) @xcite .",
    "after the appearance of k. kraus seminal work , several authors proposed alternative definitions of the photon position povm relying on the theory of quantum estimate @xcite or on explicit models describing actual measurements performed in photocounting experiments @xcite .    despite such remarkable achievements ,",
    "the most appropriate single - photon description remains controversial , since the above approaches were conceived to solve the specific problem of photon localization , and do not appear amenable of an immediate generalization to all other single - photon observables .",
    "in particular , the photon spin is another notoriously delicate topic@xcite , often ignored in favor of the more familiar notions of helicity and polarization .",
    "a renewed interest , due to recent experimental developments especially concerning quantum cryptography protocols @xcite , for the spin of single photons nevertheless calls for an appropriate and manageable description of such observable , in a common picture with that of position .    in the present work ,",
    "we generalize k. kraus construction of the single - photon position observable , given within g. ludwig s axiomatic formulation of quantum mechanics @xcite , to a formalism in which _ all _ the fundamental single - photon observables are given in a unified way in terms of povms @xcite . following the construction of the single - photon hilbert space given by k. kraus and h. moses @xcite , based on the representation theory of the poincar group for mass @xmath1 and spin @xmath2 particles , given by e. p. wigner @xcite",
    ", we interpret the notorious suppression of @xmath0-helicity photon states as a projection from an extended hilbert space onto the single - photon hilbert space .    extending k. kraus construction of the single - photon position observable",
    ", we show that all single - photon observables are described by povms obtained by applying this projection to pvms defined on the extended hilbert space and mutuated from the well - established quantum description of relativistic massive particles .",
    "we provide explicit expressions for the povms describing the joint measurement of spin and momentum , and of spin and position .",
    "the results show that momentum and helicity are described by pvms , while spin and position by povms .",
    "such difference naturally reflects the well - known@xcite circumstance that povms describe _ unsharp _ observables reflecting either practical limits in the precision of measurements ( in which case povms typically correspond to coarse - grained version of pvms ) or inherent difficulties in realizing a preparation in which the value of an observable is perfectly defined @xcite .",
    "in particular , the intrinsic unsharpness of position and spin results from the coupling between momentum and spin introduced by the suppression of @xmath0-helicity states , a specific consequence of the mass @xmath1 and spin @xmath2 of the photon .",
    "we finally apply this formalism to assess the increase of the statistical character of single - photon observables naturally brought along by the intrinsic _ unsharpness _ of povms @xcite . for this purpose",
    "we investigate preparation uncertainty relations for position and momentum , as well as the spin probability distribution .",
    "these quantities are analytically calculated for a broad class of physically meaningful single - photon states , namely gaussian states with definite polarization and projections of gaussian states with definite spin .",
    "the reasons behind the choice of gaussian states range from their great theoretical and experimental relevance to the fact that , in the non - relativistic context , they saturate the notorious inequality @xmath3 , identifying themselves as the most suitable candidate to investigate the increment of the statistical character of quantum theory brought into stage by the povms .",
    "our results show that the emergence of povms systematically increases the randomness of the outcomes@xcite .",
    "in particular , the inequality @xmath3 is saturated only in the limiting case of infinitely sharp states in the momentum space ; for any finite gaussian width , we observe instead an increase in the product @xmath4 , of which we give a fully analytic estimate .",
    "we observe a similar increase of randomness in the spin probability distribution .",
    "such increment appears to be a manifestation of the unsharpness of position and spin , and of the inherent impossibility of sharply localizing a single photon in a bounded space region @xcite , and of preparing it with definite spin along a spatial direction independent on its momentum @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : formalism ] the quantum mechanical description of a single free photon is reviewed ; in section [ sec : uncertainty ] the procedure for constructing single - photon observables is delineated and the povms and probability densities of such observables are explicitly given .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : results ] , a detailed study of the preparation uncertainty relations for position and momentum and of the spin probability distributions of gaussian states is presented , and conclusions are drawn in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in the present section , a detailed review of the single - photon formalism given by k. kraus in @xcite will be given .",
    "particular attention will be devoted to the representation theory of the poincar group @xcite and on the introduction of an isomorphism based on the representation of the @xmath5 group for spin @xmath2 particles @xcite .",
    "all these elements will provide a framework for the discussion in section [ sec : uncertainty ] , where all the single - photon observables observables , including spin , will be defined as povms through a unified picture generalizing k. kraus treatment of the position observable @xcite .",
    "it is worth reminding that the term _ photon _ does not correspond to a unique notion in literature @xcite : photons are either treated as spin @xmath2 and mass @xmath1 irreducible representations of the poincar group @xcite , or as occupations of electromagnetic field modes . in the present work we will rely on the first approach , which naturally brings to the introduction of povms .",
    "wigner s seminal work @xcite on the representation of theory of the poincar group , revealed the existence of a deep connection between the symmetries underlying galilean or special relativity and the measurable quantities of an elementary particle .",
    "concretely , the mathematical description of a quantum particle existing in space - time should reflect its galilei or poincar invariance , and consequently the state space of such particle should carry an irreducible representation , characterized by its spin and mass , of either the galilei or the poincar group @xcite . with the purpose of introducing the single - photon formalism ,",
    "let us start by considering the quantum mechanical description of a _ non - relativistic _ particle with spin @xmath2 , which takes place in the hilbert space : @xmath6 here @xmath7 is meant to be the momentum space , elements of @xmath8 are square - integrable @xmath9-component functions : @xmath10 and @xmath8 is equipped with the inner product : @xmath11 the roto - translation group admits the familiar @xcite unitary representation @xmath12 on @xmath8 : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the matrix associated to the rotation of an angle @xmath15 around the axis @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the vector associated to a spatial translation , and @xmath18 denotes the vector of @xmath19 pauli matrices : @xmath20 it is a well - known fact that a projective irreducible representation of the galilei group can be obtained by introducing the non - relativistic position operator @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the photon anyway is a purely relativistic particle and thus the formalism given above can not suit the purpose of describing it . in order to accomplish such task ,",
    "let us observe that the matrices @xmath14 and @xmath18 are related to each other by @xcite @xmath22 where the unitary matrix @xmath23 reads @xcite @xmath24 the key relation is a peculiar prerogative of the spin @xmath2 case and suggests to introduce the following unitary transformation : @xmath25 on @xmath8 .",
    "it is immediately noticed that wavefunctions @xmath26 in @xmath27 transform as a vector field under roto - translations @xmath28 @xmath29 it is worth of notice that the difference between and consists in the replacements @xmath30 , @xmath31 and correspondingly @xmath32 . the simple change of basis operated by the matrix @xmath23 indicates to generalize the formalism outlined above by means of the following procedure :    * endowing wavefunctions in @xmath27 with a fourth component , @xmath33 , this way promoting them to four - component functions : @xmath34 of the four - momentum @xmath35 satisfying the mass - shell condition @xmath36 where @xmath37 and einstein s convention is assumed .",
    "the functions lie in the vector space : @xmath38 * equipping @xmath39 with the following sesquilinear form : @xmath40 in which the poincar invariant measure @xmath41 replaces the non - relativistic roto - translationally invariant lebesgue measure @xmath42 . *",

    "@xmath39 , @xcite which is a direct consequence of the non - positivity of the minkowski inner product @xmath47 , prevents the possibility of giving a probabilistic interpretation to this formalism .",
    "nevertheless , such obstacle can be overcome in the special case of massless particles such as photons .",
    "in fact , the massless condition naturally identifies a subspace @xmath48 @xmath49 which is invariant under poincar transformations , since : @xmath50 whence @xmath51 for all poincar transformations .",
    "moreover , the restriction of results to be non - negative . to prove this result , it is convenient to expand the spatial part of a function @xmath52 on the _ intrinsic frame _ @xmath53 given by : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is an arbitrary unit vector @xcite independent on @xmath56",

    "following @xcite we interpret these components as irrelevant degrees of freedom , this fact being precursive of the gauge symmetry of the electromagnetic theory@xcite .",
    "this interpretation is confirmed if the action of poincar transformations on functions in @xmath60 is taken in consideration .",
    "in fact , it is immediate to show that that @xmath66 has components @xmath67 which depend only on @xmath68 through the relation : @xmath69 where @xmath70 indicates the spatial part of @xmath71 .",
    "these arguments lead immediately to the construction of the single - photon hilbert space : equation defines a seminorm on @xmath60 , and we can construct a normed space out of @xmath60 taking the quotient @xmath72 of @xmath73 by the equivalence relation : @xmath74 where @xmath75 denotes the seminorm induced by on @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "@xmath72 is equipped with the scalar product , which is now manifestly positive - definite , and carries an irreducible representation of the poincar group defined by .",
    "each wavefunction in @xmath76 is an equivalence class of functions ins @xmath60 , parametrized by a pair : @xmath77 of complex - valued square - integrable functions , thus making @xmath72 isomorphic to @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "each and every equivalence class in @xmath72 has a representative with the following _ transversal form _ : @xmath79 all other elements of the equivalence class are related to the transversal representative by the addition of an unphysical component @xmath80 .",
    "this fact shows that the single - photon hlbert space is also isomorphic to the space of square - integrable transverse wavefunctions : @xmath81 retrieving the result given by k. kraus in equations ( 2),(3 ) of @xcite .",
    "the construction outlined above has lead in a very natural way to the introduction of the single - photon state space @xmath76 by just considering the conditions of mass @xmath1 and spin @xmath82 , and requiring that @xmath76 carries an irreducible representation of the poincar group .",
    "the concrete realization of the single - photon hilbert space @xmath76 has the advantage of providing a one - to - one correspondence between states and transverse vector functions .    the physically relevant photon states with linear and circular polarization are elements of @xmath76 of the form : @xmath83 and : @xmath84 finally , one might wish to relate such construction of the single - photon state space to the familiar one based on the requirement of helicity @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "the equivalence of the two approaches is readily proved by recalling the isomorphism @xmath23 , introduced to identify the spin as generator of rotations in .",
    "in fact , it can be explicitly shown that the images of the intrisic frame vectors under the action of the matrix @xmath23 are closely related to the eigenstates of the helicity operator : @xmath86 in particular @xmath87 is the eigenstate relative to the eigenvalue @xmath88 , while @xmath89 are the eigenstates relative to eigenvalues @xmath85 respectively .",
    "in the present section single - photon observables will be introduced as povms , generalizing the treatment of position given by k. kraus in @xcite . with such purpose",
    ", the single - photon hilbert space @xmath76 introduced in the previous section has to be regarded as a subspace of the extended hilbert space @xmath90 whose elements have the form : @xmath91 and thus differ from elements of @xmath76 by the addition of a longitudinal component @xmath92 . in equation , and in the remainder of the present work , we express states as functions of @xmath56 rather than @xmath93 with harmless abuse of notation .",
    "@xmath76 is obtained from @xmath94 by means of the projection operator : @xmath95 with @xmath96 the projector eliminates the longitudinal component of the triple @xmath97 and can thus be interpreted as an analogue of the helmholtz projection used for decomposing the electric and magnetic field of classical electrodynamics into a longitudinal and a transverse component . under roto - translations , states in @xmath98 must transform as vector fields : @xmath99 in order to retrieve .",
    "the introduction of the spin and helicity observables , nevertheless , requires a transformation law under roto - translations involving the vector of pauli matrices , as in , instead of the rotation matrix , as in .",

    "the change of basis operated by the matrix @xmath23 not only elucidates the equivalence between the conditions of transversality and non - zero helicity but , as in the case of non - relativistic particles , leads to an irreducible representation of the roto - translation group that involves the vector @xmath18 of spin matrices .",

    "<S> we propose a procedure for defining all single - photon observables in terms of positive - operator valued measures ( povms ) , in particular spin and position . </S>",
    "<S> we identify the suppression of @xmath0-helicity photon states as a projection from an extended hilbert space onto the physical single - photon hilbert space . </S>",
    "<S> we show that all single - photon observables are in general described by povms , obtained by applying this projection to opportune projection - valued measures ( pvms ) , defined on the extended hilbert space . </S>",
    "<S> the povms associated to momentum and helicity reduce to pvms , unlike those associated to position and spin , this fact reflecting the intrinsic unsharpness of these observables . </S>",
    "<S> we finally extensively study the preparation uncertainty relations for position and momentum and the probability distribution of spin , exploring single photon gaussian states for several choices of spin and polarization . </S>"
