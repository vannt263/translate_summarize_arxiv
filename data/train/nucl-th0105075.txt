    "a theoretical description of nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) scattering is a fundamental ingredient for the understanding of nuclear structure and scattering of few- and many - body nuclear systems @xcite .",
    "this was and still is a paradigm of nuclear physics .",
    "however , this scope widens with the intellectual challenge to go beyond the physics of a single hadron and understand essential aspects of nuclear physics from first principles as the qcd @xcite .",
    "a recent review of key issues of hadronic physics comprises the many branches of current fundamental nuclear research @xcite .",
    "as the qcd lagrangian may be considered known , it is generally agreed that the nonlinear dynamics of qcd make it difficult to understand nuclear physics fully from first principles .",
    "thus , being less ambitious , it is believed that the majority of nuclear physics phenomena can be understood in terms of appropriate effective degrees of freedom .",
    "it is the deductive branch of nuclear epistemology which builds models , suggests methods to determine these degrees of freedom and finds interpretations for them . being an enthusiast , this approach may lead to emerging new phenomena and thus to a widened nuclear physics realm .",
    "all phenomena are associated with scales and the nuclear - hadronic scale dependence can be broken into three regions : nuclear structure at scales @xmath2mev , the hadronic and dibaryonic substructure scales @xmath3gev and the partonic region scales @xmath4gev .",
    "the nuclear energy scale , @xmath2mev , is very small when the natural energy scale of qcd is of the order of @xmath3gev .",
    "does this difference arise from cancellations of strongly attractive and repulsive terms in the nuclear interaction or is there some deeper reason for this scale change responsible ?",
    "quark - gluon confinement opens a route to a convincing answer of this question .",
    "the large separation between the hadronic energy scale and the nuclear binding scale renders it difficult to apply nonlinear qcd directly to understand the physics of nuclei .",
    "however , quantitative calculations based on effective quantum field theory ( eqf ) techniques that arise from chiral symmetry provide an alternative approach .",
    "this method has been applied to pion physics in the context of chiral perturbation theory .",
    "currently , it is being extended to address few- and many - nucleon interactions . when combined with first principle calculations of the low energy constants from qcd",
    ", these eqf may have the potential to provide a consistent qualitative understanding of low energy properties of nuclei and emergent nuclear structure .",
    "in addition to understanding the structure of nuclei from a qcd point of view , it is also of interest to understand the behavior of nucleons within nuclei .",
    "well known are modified nn interactions in the form of _ off - shell t- or g - matrices_. they render useful for nuclear matter densities in stable nuclei but this description is incomplete as deep inelastic scattering experiments by the emc collaboration suggested that also the quark distribution in a nucleon , immersed in nuclear matter , differs from that in free space . within the key issues of hadronic physics one of the interesting issues in nuclear physics",
    "is whether there is a transition region between meson - nucleon and quark - gluon degrees of freedom in the nn interaction .",
    "this question is relevant for pairs of free nucleons as well as for nucleon pairs immersed in nuclear matter .",
    "in sect.2 we report about our efforts using inverse scattering theory to scan recent nn phase shift analysis to 3 gev @xcite with the purpose to find precursor phenomena and transitions from the meson - nucleon sector into the quark - gluon sector ( qcd dominated sector ) . to differentiate between reaction mechanism in medium energy nn scattering we devised and generated nn optical models for @xmath5 gev and calculated quantities which could reveal intrinsic hadronic excitations @xmath6 as well as fusion and fission of dibaryonic intermediate states .",
    "a dibaryonic scale of 1 gev is deduced as nn soft core potential strengths , for nn relative distances of @xmath0 fm .",
    "this topic is very interesting in connection with questions of hadronization of the quark - gluon plasma .    in sect.3",
    "we discuss results of medium energy nucleon - nucleus ( na ) elastic scattering .",
    "these calculations use the nn optical model potentials to generate nn t- and g - matrices in folding na optical models .",
    "the calculations are based upon a relativistically corrected full - folding optical model in momentum space that is an extension of a nonrelativistic predecessor @xcite .",
    "the motivation for these calculations comes from two opposite directions .",
    "the first attempts a fundamental understanding of the structure of nuclei from a qcd point of view and the interest to understand the behavior of nucleons within nuclei .",
    "the other direction is given from applied nuclear technology where large amounts of nuclear reaction data , including fission cross sections at intermediate energies are required for accelerator transmutation of waste ( atw ) , for elimination of long - lived radioactive wastes with a spallation source , accelerator - based conversion ( abc ) aimed to complete the destruction of weapon plutonium , accelerator - driven energy production ( adep ) which proposes to derive fission energy from thorium with concurrent destruction of the long - lived waste and without the production of nuclear weapon material , and for accelerator production of tritium ( apt ) @xcite .",
    "the results are preliminary and comprise angular distributions , total and reaction cross sections for elastic nucleon scattering from the targets @xmath7o , @xmath8ca , @xmath9zr and @xmath10pb in an energy domain @xmath11gev .",
    "the na optical model is the best quantitative and microscopic nuclear model , based on a profound understanding of the nuclear many body dynamics and nn potentials in terms of structureless nucleons ( protons and neutrons ) for @xmath12mev @xcite .",
    "of the spectrum , low energy nn scattering traditionally is described in terms of few degrees of freedom of which spin and isospin symmetries play the predominant role . at medium energies , production processes and inelasticities become important and several elementary systems composed of nucleons and mesons contribute to nn scattering .",
    "while these nucleons and mesons are emergent structures from qcd , at present there is no quantitative description of nn scattering above the inelastic threshold either in terms of qcd or of the emergent nucleons and mesons .",
    "the experimental nn data and its parameterization in terms of amplitudes and phase shifts , are very smooth with energy to 3 gev @xcite ; a feature which supports use of the _ classic _ approach using a free nn interaction potential also above 300 mev . a high quality fit of on - shell t - matrices by a potential model is very desirable also as it facilitates t- and g - matrix extension into the off - shell domain ; properties which are needed in few and many body calculations . in particular ,",
    "microscopic optical model potentials for elastic nucleon - nucleus scattering that give quantitative results , require a careful and exact treatment of the on- and off - shell nn t - matrices @xcite .",
    "furthermore , calculations of such entities have shown that it is crucial to have on - shell values of the t - matrices in best possible agreement with nn data at all energies .",
    "there are many studies of few and many body problems in the low energy regime @xmath13mev and the results have consequences for any model extension above threshold .",
    "we note in this context that significant off - shell differences in t - matrices are known to exist between the theoretically well motivated boson exchange models of nn scattering in this regime .",
    "it remains difficult to attribute with certainty any particular dynamical or kinematical feature with those differences .",
    "non - locality , explicit energy dependence and features associated with relativistic kinematics are some possibilities .",
    "in contrast , there is the quantum inverse scattering approach by which any on - shell t - matrix can be continued into the off - shell domain .",
    "a specific method is the gelfand  levitan  marchenko inversion algorithm for sturm ",
    "liouville equations .",
    "this approach to specify t - matrices off - shell is appropriate when the physical s - matrix is unitary and the equation of motion is of the sturm  liouville type .",
    "such is valid without modification for nn t - matrices in the energy regime to 300 mev and for the unitary part of the s - matrix above this energy .    in the spirit of general inverse problems",
    ", we extended the gelfand  levitan  marchenko method by additional potential terms which are determined by a demand to reproduce perfectly the experimental data ( here the partial wave phase shift analysis ) . by",
    "that means nn optical models , separately for each partial wave , were generated .",
    "the algorithm we have developed allows studies of complex local and/or separable potentials in combination with any background potential @xcite .",
    "we limited the reference potential to the well known real r - space potentials from paris @xcite , nijmegen @xcite , argonne @xcite , and from gelfand  levitan  marchenko quantum inversion @xcite .",
    "to them we add channel dependent complex separable potentials with energy dependent strengths . for given input data",
    "result unique full optical model potentials that are defined within a given potential class .",
    "nn scattering formally is given by the bethe ",
    "salpeter equation @xmath14 where @xmath15 are invariant amplitudes that are based upon all connected two particle irreducible diagrams .",
    "this equation serves generally as an ansatz for approximations . of those ,",
    "the three dimensional reductions are of great use which allow the definition of a potential . in particular , the blankenbecler ",
    "sugar reduction gives an equation @xmath16 using the substitutions @xmath17 a simplified form of the t - matrix is obtained .",
    "it is the familiar lippmann ",
    "schwinger equation @xmath18 the equivalence between the lippmann ",

    ".      a particular solution of potentials @xmath24 is @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "such potential is able to reproduce the real phase shifts and may be generated with inversion techniques .",
    "there are two equivalent inversion algorithms for the sturm  liouville equation , which one identifies as the marchenko and the gelfand  levitan inversion .",
    "both yield principally the same solution and numerically they are complementary .",
    "the salient features are outlined for the case of uncoupled marchenko inversion .    in the marchenko inversion",
    "the experimental information enters via the s - matrix , @xmath27 , with which an input kernel is defined in the form of a fourier - hankel transform @xmath28 h^+_\\ell(tk ) dk,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 are riccati - hankel functions .",
    "this input kernel when used in the marchenko equation , @xmath30 specifies the translation kernel @xmath31 .",
    "the potential is a boundary condition for that translational kernel , @xmath32    such inversion potentials , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath33 , have been made also to follow closely the gwu / sp00 real phase shifts to 3 gev @xcite .",
    "the phase shifts are shown in fig.[figure_n1 ] , and potentials are displayed in fig.[figure_n2 ] .",
    "they possess a long range yukawa tail , a medium range attraction @xmath341 - 2 fm and a strong short range repulsion with an onset at 1 fm .",
    "these potentials are energy independent so that the long and medium range potential properties diminish in importance for kinetic energies above 500 mev . for projectiles with @xmath35gev essentially",
    "only the repulsive core of these potentials remains of significance for scattering .",
    "thus inversion potentials have also been obtained with the gwu / sp00 real phase shifts optimally fitted to 3 gev @xcite using weighted data , @xmath36 for @xmath37gev and @xmath38 for higher energies , to emphasize the high energy data and fix more stringently the short range ( @xmath39 fm ) character of the deduced interaction .",
    "the short range properties of these inversion potentials so found are displayed in fig.[figure_n3 ] and more details are described and shown in @xcite .",
    "the key features are constrained to low partial waves @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( the @xmath42 @xmath43 _ np _ channel , is limited to @xmath44gev ) for @xmath45gev .",
    "this energy region was also fitted with a simple gaussian potential to filter and emphasize the short range region .",
    "the higher partial waves are shielded by the centripetal barrier and they require higher energies to yield essential fusion / fission contributions .",
    "the gaussian potential ansatz restricts eqs.([eqn_ii.678 ] ) to @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 we have fitted the potential strengths and ranges , using phase shifts at many energies within intervals @xmath50 mev , and use @xmath51 in eq.([eqn_ii.678 ] ) .",
    "it is important to notice that the real strength has a robust value @xmath52gev and that the real gaussian potentials follow closely the energy independent gelfand ",
    "marchenko inversion potentials .",
    "this result is shown in fig.[figure_n3 ] and fig.[figure_n4 ] .    in fig.[figure_n4 ]",

    "the fits imply a robust @xmath53fm , @xmath54fm and @xmath55fm with an imaginary absorptive potential which is 25% stronger in the p- than in the s - channel .",
    "the imaginary potentials account for _ flux - loss _ from the elastic scattering channel and this effect is displayed in the right column of sub - figures in fig.[figure_n5 ] .",
    "the flux - loss was calculated with normalized radial wave functions and the imaginary part of the optical model potentials @xmath56.\\ ] ]    the left sub - column in fig.[figure_n5 ] contains the results of @xcite that use as full optical model , a reference ( invs ) plus separable optical model potential .",
    "we confirm with the gaussian optical model the previously noticed decoupling of the real and imaginary potentials and the independence of the flux - loss picture calculated with either a separable ( left column ) or a local ( right column ) potential . the radial scale of real potential and absorption is significantly smaller than the scale of nucleon charge form factors or a convolution of two nucleons in a folding approach .",
    "a reaction scheme for this sequence is shown in fig.[figure_n6 ] .",

    "is implied a reference to a gaussian charge form factor of the nucleons .",
    "the overlap of charge form factors of two nucleons is shown in fig.[figure_n8 ] .",
    "this calculation helps to visualize an intermediate fusion into a combined elementary particle ( dibaryon ) with a similar size as a nucleon .",
    "in particular notice the overlap of 80% for the @xmath70fm and 60% for the @xmath71fm channels .",
    "a folding approach uses @xmath72 with a quark density in a nucleon @xmath73 and an effective interaction @xmath74 which acts between the continuously distributed quark density components .",
    "this double folding expression may be formulated with nonrelativistic / relativistic quark models and gluon exchange as well as qcd based dynamical models with effective quark masses and goldstone boson exchanges .",
    "however , all this goes beyond what we have done so far but links to current approaches @xcite . for us , it is beyond any doubt and appears urgent to find a microscopic interpretation of the strengths and ranges observed with the phenomenological or inversion optical model potentials .    in summary , from this analysis",
    "we draw the conclusion that the gwu phase shift analyses ( understood as representative for experimental data ) @xcite yield consistent optical model potentials with fluxloss at short distances  interpreted as dibaryonic fusion / fission mechanism  and a real soft core potential with a strength @xmath59gev .",
    "this value requires a deeper fundamental understanding , in particular and not the least , since the core potential value coincides with the proton and neutron masses .",
    "the formation of an intermediate dibaryon is favoured for the @xmath40 and less favoured for the @xmath41 channels . for higher partial waves the intermediate individual excitations of the participating nucleons into @xmath75,n@xmath76",
    "is prevailing , see medium and high energy reaction schemes , figs . 9 and 10 in @xcite .",
    "in fig.[figure_a1 ] we show a reaction scheme which underlies all microscopic optical model approaches .",
    "the na optical model is defined as a folding optical model in which the _ in - medium _ two particle effective interaction is convoluted with the correlated target structure .",
    "principally , the free nn interaction is used to generate any part of effective _ in - medium _ interaction such as two particle t- and g - matrices . for energies above the meson production threshold nn scattering",
    "becomes a three and many body problem which prohibits a consistent treatment solely with two nucleons .",
    "instead of incorporating at such high energies meson channels we continued , _ in the past _ , by neglecting this effect instead of using a nucleon - nucleon optical model .",
    "now we used an nn optical model with the effect that the imaginary part of the t- and g - matrix has a twofold origin .",
    "these are the contributions from the greens function pole and the complex nn optical potential .",
    "we assume that off - shell t- and g - matrices are also consistently described with the nn optical model .    over the past three decades several efforts have succeeded in providing a detailed first - order description of intermediate energy nucleon - nucleus ( na ) scattering @xcite .",
    "the explicit and accurate treatment of the effective nn interaction on- and off - shell is undisputed and in accordance with the full - folding optical model ( ff - omp ) . in the past , emphasis has been placed on retaining a one boson exchange ( obep ) real nn interaction to calculate off - shell t- and g - matrices .",
    "this restricted na optical model studies to projectile energies @xmath77mev .",
    "recently , inversion potentials , calculated to fit elastic nn phase - shift data up to 1.3 gev in the laboratory frame , have been used in ff - omp calculations for projectile energies @xmath78mev @xcite .",
    "although this extension gave a better description of na scattering relative to previous ones , they still neglected nn absorption and an adequate treatment of relativistic kinematics in the folding procedure and effects of isobar excitations .",
    "thus , the primary aim of this work is to extend the range of the nonrelativistic ff - omp into a relativistically corrected version which can be used for na scattering at energies @xmath79gev .    to this purpose one of the interesting issues",
    "is whether there is evidence of a transition region between meson - nucleon and quark - gluon degrees of freedom , which we conjecture in the free nn interaction for @xmath80gev , for nucleon pairs immersed in nuclear matter .",
    "answers to this issue are still pending but work is in progress and some results are shown .",
    "since the lorentz contraction scales as the ratio of projectile energy to mass , and na scattering at projectile energies @xmath81mev have noticeable contraction effects , it is necessary to include kinematical and dynamical corrections at all stages of the ff - omp .",
    "some relativistic effects are _ effectively _ included in the nn t- and g - matrix calculations whereas the projectile - nucleus relativistic corrections are readily included in manners which have been developed and verified in the past @xcite .",
    "thus , the study of na scattering with relativistic models is not new and several successful approaches are known @xcite .",
    "consistent models , of the t@xmath69 impulse approximation , treat kinematical and dynamical relativistic effects within one framework . it was shown for optical models in general , that use of the best possible target structure in combination with a first order approximation of the dynamical corrections of na scattering , yield a high quality microscopic omp @xcite .",
    "the purpose and result of this work is to show that , with relativistic kinematic corrections in the ff - omp , high quality na scattering results for energies @xmath11gev are obtained .    in the nonrelativistic ff - omp",
    "the coupling between projectile and mixed ground state density of target nucleons is given by an effective nn interaction and , in the projectile - nucleus cm frame , the optical potential is defined by @xmath82 @xmath83 represents target single - particle wave functions of energy @xmath84 , and @xmath85 indicates it limitation below the fermi energy @xmath86 .",
    "the nn @xmath87 is calculated as t- or g - matrix at starting energies @xmath88 in the na cm frame ( subscript a+n ) @xcite . in the absence of medium modifications or at high energies ,",
    "the g - matrix is approximated by the t - matrix . since",
    "medium modifications have been shown to be important only for energies @xmath89mev we will make our relativistic corrections as if the effective interaction @xmath87 is a t - matrix .",
    "the optical potential eq.([eqn_iii.1 ] ) requires the nn t - matrix in the projectile - nucleus cm frame .",
    "generally , the t - matrices are calculated in the nn cm system with a lippmann  schwinger equation and a two nucleon potential ; the practical problem is how to translate the t - matrix into the proper reference frame .",
    "this problem is not new and has been discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "they use simply a lorentz boost for the kinematic variables between the reference frames .    in impulse approximation ,",
    "the transformation of the t - matrix from the nn to the na cm frame can be done sequentially .",
    "first , all four momenta in the na cm system need to be transformed to the nn cm system .",
    "second , as lorentz invariance of the flux is assumed , the mller flux factor transforms the nn t - matrices .",
    "third , a spin rotation between the reference systems requires a wigner rotation @xcite .",
    "guided from fig.[figure_a1 ] , the nn interaction in eq.([eqn_iii.1 ] ) involves incoming and outgoing four - momenta @xmath90 of the projectile and struck - nucleon @xmath91 respectively .",
    "the effective nn interaction is translated by @xmath92 with the mller factor @xmath93      an assessement of the sensitivity of the full - folding optical potential to the inclusion of relativistic kinematics over a wide energy range can be made by studying reaction and total cross sections for neutron elastic scattering . in figs .",
    "[ figure_n9 ] and [ figure_n10 ] we show the measured @xcite and calculated reaction and total cross sections for neutron elastic scattering from @xmath7o , @xmath8ca , @xmath9zr and @xmath10pb at projectile energies from 100 mev up to 1.5 gev .",
    "these cross sections are obtained by solving the scattering problem using full - folding optical potentials calculated as in @xcite , with the kinematics discussed in the most recent work @xcite .    as a very important comparison ,",

    "it is not unexpected but important to know that the choice of reference potential has some effect but the differences between av18 and invs are visible in fig .",
    "[ figure_n9 ] .",
    "this confirms the importance and need of on - shell equivalent potentials and careful inclusion of off - shell g- and t - matrices at any stage of a folding calculation @xcite .",
    "the calculated results also show a nearly constant cross section as function of energy above 1 gev .",
    "we are not aware of data above 1 gev to confirm that part of our calculations .",

    "again we observe hardly differences between the g- and t - matrix approaches at energies above 700 mev but the differences become pronounced at lower energies .",
    "a few remarks are noteworthy regarding the full - folding applications made here as compared with calculations made in the context of the nonrelativistic impulse approximation t@xmath69 based on the kerman , mcmanus and thaler formalism @xcite .",
    "the calculation of optical potentials within the full - folding approach presented here are made without assumptions neither about the local structure of the nn effective interaction nor the final structure of the na coupling .",
    "in fact , these potentials are treated as non - local potential operators obtained from a detailed account of the nn effective interaction off - shell .",
    "in contrast , the momentum space optical potentials in the nonrelativistic impulse approximation are often assumed as being local and in calculations only on - shell g- and t - matrix elements of the nn effective interaction enter .",
    "important differences have been observed between these two approaches when applied to intermediate energy ( 200 - 400 mev ) na scattering @xcite .",
    "both full - folding and t@xmath69 approximation calculations were made using the free t - matrix with giebink relativistic kinematics .",
    "differences between these two approaches become noticeable for momentum transfers @xmath100@xmath101 and the importance of off - shell effects are obvious .",
    "the extent of this sensitivity is comparable to contributions from short - range correlations .",
    "the most significant difference between results of the past and the ones presented here are coming from the nn optical model potential used .",
    "medium effects due to pauli blocking and mean field effects are small for energies above 700 mev .",
    "a definitive signal of nn dibaryonic formation in na scattering could not be identified as yet .",
