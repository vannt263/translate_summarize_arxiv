    "the speed of light plays an important role for the lorentz - group and the physics of special relativity ( sr ) .",
    "it is the only speed that remains invariant under a change of reference frame , and it determines the causal structure of space - time .",
    "most importantly , the speed of light is the asymptotic limit of the speed of accelerated massive bodies , and information can not be transmitted any faster .",
    "the derivation of these properties from the symmetries of minkowski - space is straight - forward and sr has been experimentally confirmed to high precision .",
    "however , lorentz - symmetry might not be respected by the yet - to - be found theory of quantum gravity , and in fact deviations from lorentz - symmetry are the so far most promising route to make contact between theoretical approaches to quantize gravity and observation @xcite .",
    "the maybe most obvious way that deviations from lorentz - invariance can make themselves noticeable is a breaking of lorentz - invariance by the existence of a preferred frame .",
    "the preferred frame defines a timelike vector field , and one expects this field to couple to other fields of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "such a breaking of lorentz - invariance in extensions of the sm is very strongly constrained already @xcite .",
    "the introduction of a fundamental preferred frame also leaves open the question why , if not exact , lorentz - symmetry is still approximately exact to high precision , in the sense that relevant operators and operators of dimension 5 that couple to the timelike vector field are so strongly suppressed . therefore , lorentz - invariance violating operators in the sm face both experimental and theoretical challenges .",
    "an alternative to the introduction of a preferred frame is to make different values of the speed of light compatible with observer - independence by modifying the action of the poincar - group .",
    "this enables the observer - invariance of an energy - dependent speed of light , and has been developed in an approach known as `` deformed special relativity '' ( dsr ) @xcite .",
    "such deformations of special relativity are intimately related to non - commutative geometry , an idea that dates back to snyder in 1947 @xcite , and that has received a lot of attention since it was shown to arise by quantum deformations of poincar symmetry @xcite .",
    "the relation to dsr was made in @xcite and has given rise to many related works that have entered the literature under the names of modified commutation relations , minimal length deformed quantum mechanics , or generalized uncertainty .",
    "these frameworks all explicitly or implicitly make use of deformations of special relativity .",
    "dsr has been motivated by loop quantum gravity , though no rigorous derivation exists to date .",
    "there are however non - rigorous arguments that dsr may emerge from a semiclassical limit of quantum gravity theories in the form of an effective field theory with an energy dependent metric @xcite , or that dsr ( in form of the @xmath0-poincar algebra ) may result from a version of path integral quantization @xcite .",
    "in addition it has been shown that in 2 + 1 dimensional gravity coupled to matter , the gravitational degrees of freedom can be integrated out , leaving an effective field theory for the matter which is a quantum field theory on @xmath0-minkowski space - time , realizing a particular version of dsr @xcite .",
    "recently , it has also been suggested that dsr could arise via loop quantum cosmology @xcite .",
    "originally formulated in momentum space , it has however proven difficult to extend the formalism of dsr to position space , and the so - far pursued attempts lead to macroscopic non - localities . the interpretation and relevance of these non - localities is subject of an ongoing discussion .",
    "( more on this in section [ causality ] ) .",
    "it has been proposed @xcite that dsr is a classical relic of the quantum gravitational regime in the following sense . to modify the structure of momentum space and the action of the lorentz - group on it",
    ", one needs a constant of dimension mass that one can identify with the planck mass , @xmath1 .",
    "one does not however need a constant of dimension length .",
    "it now happens to be the case that in four dimensions one can send both newton s constant @xmath2 and @xmath3 to zero , while keeping the ratio @xmath4 fixed .",
    "this corresponds to a limit with @xmath1 finite and @xmath5 that , while not actually being quantum gravitational , may still capture deviations from sr that originated in planck scale effects .",
    "we will look here into an entirely different approach to modified lorentz - invariance ; an approach that circumvents both the bounds on lorentz - invariance violations and the difficulties with locality , and therefore offers an intriguing new solution to these open problems .",
    "knowing that deformations as classical relics of quantum gravitational effects have been difficult to reconcile with local field theory , we will consider instead a modification that is a pure quantum effect . and instead of introducing a fundamental preferred frame on the level of the action , we introduce a preferred frame only through the process of measurement . the @xmath3 is thus instrumental but , at least for the purpose of this paper , we will not aim to describe gravitational effects and restrict ourselves to flat space .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the basic idea and its formalism , and in section [ inter ] lay out the physics of interactions .",
    "section [ causality ] is dedicated to locality and causality , and in section [ cons ] we discuss some phenomenological consequences , though the details shall be left for a future work .",
    "we discuss assumptions made and questions left open in section [ disc ] before concluding in [ conc ] .    in the following we use the unit convention @xmath6 .",
    "small greek indices run from @xmath7 to @xmath8 , and an arrow indicates the spatial component of a four - vector , e.g. @xmath9 .",
    "the signature of the metric is @xmath10 .",
    "the constant @xmath11 denotes the usual speed of light .",
    "let space - time be a four dimensional manifold @xmath12 with lorentzian signature . we equip it with quantum properties by a metric that , instead of being a tensor valued function on @xmath12 , is an operator @xmath13 that acts on a wavefunction @xmath14 which describes the background spacetime .",
    "in the general case this operator could have many eigenvalues and -functions , but for our purpose we focus on a special case : the case in which space - time is flat but the speed of light , @xmath15 , takes on different values .",
    "then the metric can be in a superposition of eigenfunctions to different @xmath15 s , described by the corresponding minkowski metric @xmath16 .",
    "these eigenfunctions fulfill the equation | * * _ ( c ) = _ ( c ) | _ ( c )  ,   | * g * = dc  ( c ) |_(c )  , with _ ( c)|_(c ) = _",
    "cc    dc   ( c)^ * ( c ) = 1  , where the asterisk denotes complex conjugation .",
    "the existence of these superpositions of metrics is natural if one considers them as different lapse functions over the same manifold .",
    "the sum ( or integral ) should actually be taken for all components of the tensor , but since we are interested only in different values of the speed of light , we can rewrite it into a sum over @xmath15 .",
    "for the sake of readability , we will in the following restrict ourselves to the case where @xmath15 has a discrete spectrum and the eigenvalues are being summed over .",
    "here and in the following an index in round brackets , @xmath17 , indicates dependence on the speed of light . its position does not matter , and we will thus place this index where it is typographically most convenient .    since @xmath15 is a dimensionful quantity , one can make a coordinate transformation that rescales the spacelike coordinates and changes the @xmath18 to some other value .",
    "but there is no one coordinate transformation that will bring all values of the @xmath19 s to agree .",
    "one should keep in mind though that physically relevant is not the actual value of one @xmath19 but just the ratio between two with different @xmath15 s .",
    "usually , if @xmath15 s are not set equal to one to begin with , they are rarely put into the metric .",
    "we chose this convention here because it has the merit that all other quantities obtain their physical units , i.e. @xmath20 has the dimension of a time , @xmath21 has the dimension of an energy and @xmath22 has the dimension of a momentum .",
    "we are concerned here with the case in which space - time is homogeneous so that the states @xmath23 are constant , a condition that is an approximation for the case in which gravitational effects are negligible .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath24 we name @xmath25 .",
    "it is the speed of light which we have experimentally measured and the standard deviation should be small .",
    "exactly how small is a question of constraints from available data .",
    "the spectrum of the operator @xmath26 should actually be derived from a theory of quantum gravity . in the absence of such a theory ,",
    "we treat it as input for the model that will be described here .",
    "our aim is to parameterize the possible effects .",
    "of course the restriction to flat space is a very special case , but it is a good starting point to develop the idea .    to every @xmath19 there is a lorentz - group with transformations @xmath27 that keep @xmath19 invariant .",
    "the operator @xmath13 is invariant under the appropriate application of the corresponding @xmath27 to the subspace spanned by the eigenvector @xmath19 .",
    "that is , the action of a unitary representation @xmath28 of a lorentz transformation @xmath29 , specified by its group parameters , is given via the eigenfunctions as ",
    "| _(c ) = u ( ) | _ ( c ) = _",
    "( c)^t _ ( c ) _ ( c ) | _ ( c) = _ ( c ) | _ ( c)  .",
    "thus , @xmath30 for each eigenvector , and the background in a superposition state remains invariant @xmath31 .",
    "the above equality is fulfilled even if the generators are different for different values of @xmath15 .",
    "this means that in principle we can perform a different lorentz - transformation on each subspace . for one distinct transformation",
    ", we have to match the generators for different subspaces suitably together .",
    "we do this by choosing the same generators of rotations for each subspace , and for the boosts we rescale the velocity so that , in the subspace belonging to @xmath15 , the velocity @xmath32 that parameterizes the boost is related to the velocity @xmath33 in the @xmath11-subspace by @xmath34 . in other words ,",
    "we match the transformations so that the commonly used quantities @xmath35 and @xmath36 remain the same in all subspaces .    the transformations @xmath27 for different values of @xmath15 are equivalent representations of the lorentz - group , i.e. there exists a matrix @xmath37 that fulfills s _ ( c ) s^-1 = _ ( c ) for each @xmath38 .",
    "the matrix @xmath37 is diag@xmath39 .",
    "the lorentz - symmetry that we invoke here thus is not new in the sense that we use only the well - known representations and actions of the lorentz - group .",
    "normally however , the parameter @xmath15 is considered fixed by experiment to one particular value , and the other , equivalent , lorentz - transformations are not regarded as physically interesting . the novel idea here is to relax this restriction on the value of @xmath15 and consider the whole set of transformations .",
    "while this symmetry transformation combines the symmetries of all the subspaces , it is not particularly useful for maintaining a space - time picture . that is because with these transformations a change of coordinates is performed differently in each @xmath15-subspace so that one obtains a whole set of coordinates .",
    "if we chose the coordinates to be the same for each @xmath15-subspace in one frame @xmath40 , then a transformation to a frame @xmath41 , moving with some relative velocity , would have different results depending on @xmath15 .",
    "keeping in mind that the coordinates are the ones constructed with einstein s synchronization procedure ( sending light signals back and forth ) , this is what one expects : the coordinates no longer agree after a boost because different subspaces use different speeds of light for synchronization . and",
    "while this transformation behavior is what one gets if one has an observer for every @xmath15 , each of which has a different notion of simultaneity , we want instead to restrict ourselves to observers in the @xmath11-subspace and transform coordinates according to his , i.e. our normal , @xmath11-transformations .",
    "the consequence is then that the transformation behavior of the elements of the other subspaces , and functions defined on these , has to be adjusted .    to see how this works ,",
    "let us leave aside quantum mechanics for a moment , and consider a classical particle with ( constant ) momentum @xmath42 moving on a trajectory @xmath43 with tangential vector @xmath44 .",
    "we endow the particle with a modified transformation behavior by requiring that @xmath45 is fulfilled in all reference frames and @xmath46 transforms like a scalar function from @xmath40 to @xmath41 , so that @xmath47 .",
    "the momentum @xmath48 in addition be lightlike with respect to @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath49 in all frames .",
    "the momentum of the particle then transforms under @xmath27 and @xmath50 under its inverse .",
    "the interpretation of this is clear so long as we are talking about a curve : it is just a curve with an unusual transformation behavior .",
    "but now instead of a curve let us consider a scalar field whose value we want to know for different @xmath51 , where @xmath51 are our usual coordinates transformed with @xmath52 .",
    "then we have to adjust the transformation behavior of the defining equation , such that @xmath53 . in @xmath41",
    "is then correctly @xmath54 .",
    "the additional factor in the transformation of the scalar function ensures that the contraction of the vector @xmath55 that transforms differently than @xmath42 remains invariant .",
    "now , to return to quantum mechanics , if @xmath56 is a state of a scalar field , then @xmath57 is a scalar function which has to obey the same transformation behavior .    at this point , it is useful to note that the partial derivative @xmath58 of @xmath59 transforms under @xmath27 , i.e. it transforms like the momentum .",
    "if one wants to evaluate a @xmath15-momentum in the @xmath11-background , one takes @xmath60 . since this contraction , while well - defined , is not invariant , the location of the indices matters .",
    "we take the contravariant momentum vector because otherwise the momentum would not be parallel to the tangential vector of the curve @xmath61 , which does not make physical sense . a lightlike @xmath15-momentum in the",
    "@xmath11-background then appears spacelike iff @xmath62 and timelike iff @xmath63 , as one expects .",
    "we usually do not measure @xmath64 , except possibly for gravitational waves , which however so far have not been directly detected .",
    "instead , we measure the speed of particles in some spacetime background .",
    "we are therefore interested in a composite system |= | g ,  , where @xmath65 is the complete wavefunction including the background and @xmath66 describes a particle in that background . if the particle is characterized by quantum numbers collectively called @xmath67 with eigenstates @xmath68 , its expansion is | & = & _ c dq   ( c ) | _ ( c ) | q , c  . in a more general case , @xmath69 could be a function also of @xmath70 , but for now we will not consider this dependence .",
    "we will come back to this possibility in the discussion .    to address the question of the invariance of the speed of light , we want to describe the propagation of the wavefunction . to that end , we start with the klein - gordon equation for a massless particle in the position representation , such that the quantum numbers @xmath70 are the particle s three momenta @xmath71 .",
    "we generalize the box operator so that it takes into account that the metric is now also an operator = _ _ g^  .",
    "it is then |&= & _ c",
    "d^3p   ( c ) _ _ g^ | _ ( c ) | p , c + & = & _ c d^3p   ( c ) _ _ _ ( c)^ | _ ( c ) | p , c  .",
    "this expansion will fulfill the klein - gordon equation when |p , c= : v_p , c ( x ) = e^- i ( et - p x )    ( e - p c )  , [ sols ] where @xmath72 . for momentum eigenstates ,",
    "this is the usual solution , but every momentum now corresponds to a superposition of different energies , depending on the value of @xmath15 .",
    "this becomes clearer if we pick one momentum eigenstate @xmath73 : @xmath74 , in which case the background spacetime is in an eigenstate to @xmath11 and we can deal with just the field @xmath75 in that background , where it fulfills the usual klein - gordon equation .",
    "the eigenmodes are lorentz - invariant in the way discussed above for the scalar function .",
    "we could either render @xmath76 lorentz - invariant by making the transformations on @xmath77 @xmath15-dependent , then we would get @xmath78 and @xmath79 and @xmath15 remains invariant .",
    "but , as previously discussed , that is not useful because the meaning of these coordinates is ambiguous .",
    "instead , we want to keep coordinates that transform all as @xmath80 , and then we transform the eigenmodes as @xmath81 .    to give a mass to the scalar field , one uses the operator @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the ( measured ) mass of the particle in the @xmath11-background and @xmath84 may return any dimensionless function of @xmath15 and @xmath83 as eigenvalues to eigenvectors @xmath85 . while @xmath86 suggests itself , there is a priori no obvious relation between the masses in the different @xmath15-subspaces , because , for what the symmetry is concerned , not only @xmath87 is invariant and of the proper dimensionality , but so is its product with any dimensionless function of @xmath15 .",
    "thus , without more insights into the mechanism of mass generation , we have to treat the particle s mass in another @xmath15-subspace as a parameter of the model . in the following , to slim down notation",
    ", we will write @xmath88 and keep in mind that @xmath89 is an operator and its value in some @xmath15-subspace not necessarily the measured mass of the particle .    one proceeds similarly for spinors .",
    "first , one generalizes the @xmath90-matrices to @xmath91 where quantities with capital latin indices have the speed of light normalized to one , i.e. @xmath92 , and @xmath93 then , in the dirac equation , one replaces the @xmath94 with @xmath95 that has eigenstates with the property @xmath96 to obtain @xmath97 as in the scalar case , the solution to this equation is a superposition of the solutions to the dirac - equation for the subspaces of the eigenvectors , i.e. different values of @xmath15 .",
    "one can use the @xmath98 to convert the transformation behavior of tensors ( similar to the way one uses the vierbein to convert from coordinate transformation to a local transformation behavior ) .",
    "if @xmath99 transforms under @xmath27 , then @xmath100 transforms under @xmath27 .",
    "one can use this to define a new momentum for the @xmath15-particles @xmath101 that transforms like a normal lorentz - vector .",
    "however , one then gets a factor @xmath102 in the phase of wavefunctions , and the wave - velocity is not given by @xmath103 .",
    "this redefinition thus is not very physical and we will not use it , though one could work instead with this quantity and carry around the factors .",
    "so far , we have considered only the evolution of the quantum state , now we will look at the measurement .",
    "we will assume that the process of measurement produces an observable that henceforth transforms under the @xmath11-representations .",
    "the process of measurement also picks out one particular restframe that plays the rle of a preferred frame once the measurement has been made .",
    "one may add this additional rle of the measurement as an axiom to the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics , but it comes about naturally if the collapse is replaced by environmentally induced decoherence , where the environment selects the frame .",
    "we will thus assume that a measurement of observable @xmath104 , represented by a hermitian operator , performed in a frame @xmath40 collapses the state to @xmath105 is an eigenstate of @xmath104 and the index @xmath40 means it is expressed in the measurement s frame .",
    "if decoherence is induced by entanglement with a thermal bath , as it is typically assumed , then the frame is the restframe of the bath .",
    "the probability for the measurement outcome is as usual .",
    "the additional assumption here is that the measurement outcome @xmath106 is a classical quantity ( a number on an lcd screen ) that transforms under the lorentz group @xmath107 .",
    "this means that the measurement reduces the extended lorentz - symmetry with the additional parameter @xmath15 to the usual one along with the transition from quantum to classical .",
    "the expectation value of the momentum operator @xmath108 is @xmath109 which is indeed the momentum of the momentum eigenstate .",
    "if one prefers to use the @xmath110 , one uses the operator @xmath111 for the energy @xmath112 one has similarly @xmath113 if we do the transformation into a different restframe @xmath41 with relative velocity @xmath32 before measurement , we obtain according to the above for each energy value in the sum e_* & = & ( e _ * - v p _ * ) + & = & e _ *  , [ red ] which is just the usual relativistic doppler redshift ! in particular it does not depend on @xmath15 and can be pulled out of the sum .",
    "since @xmath15 is invariant , this means in that case it does not matter in which reference frame one calculates the expectation value , and one can omit the index @xmath40 since it transforms under the usual sr transformation anyway .",
    "but note that even for @xmath114 the eigenvalue of a single measurement , if @xmath115 , does no longer transform the same way before and after measurement .",
    "consider we have measured the specific value @xmath116 with probability @xmath117 .",
    "then , a lorentz - transformation after measurement gives @xmath118 whereas a lorentz - transformation before measurement would have resulted in ( [ red ] ) .",
    "in particular , the velocity @xmath116 itself transforms after measurement under the usual addition law and is no longer invariant .    to summarize this section ,",
    "we have seen that we can extend lorentz - symmetry so that it accommodates different invariant speeds of light , so long as the state is in a quantum superposition .",
    "we assumed that the process of measurement does not only reduce the superposition to an eigenstate , but does at the same time reduce the symmetry to the normal lorentz - symmetry . as a result",
    "the probability distribution over different values of the speed of light is invariant , but the outcome of any one measurement no longer is .",
    "with these prerequisites from quantum mechanics , we can now look at the 2nd quantization .",
    "we expand the field as @xmath119 where the @xmath120 are the solutions ( [ sols ] ) to the free particle wave equation , and @xmath121 and repeated action of creation operators produce multi - particle states in the @xmath15-background . for a scalar field",
    "the annihilation and creation operators fulfill the commutation relation @xmath122 = \\delta_{cc ' } \\delta(\\vec p - \\vec p ' ) ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for spinor fields , one takes the appropriate spinor coefficient functions and anticommutation relations .",
    "to proceed , we now have to investigate which products of fields we can construct invariantly in order to find out which interaction terms are allowed . for the gauge fields , @xmath123 , we use the lagrangian @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the field strength tensor as usual , @xmath126 is the coupling constant , and the @xmath15-value of the fields is determined by the @xmath15-subspace of @xmath13 .",
    "this means that four - boson vertices in the non - abelian case can not mix different @xmath15-values .    in the lagrangian for fermions @xmath127 the @xmath15-value of the fermion",
    "is determined by the @xmath15-subspace of @xmath128 .",
    "the interaction term takes the form @xmath129 with the transition matrix @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "@xmath132 is not necessarily diagonal because the @xmath15-subspace of the fermions does not need to be the same as that of the gauge field .",
    "this is because , as noted earlier , we can put in a factor @xmath133 to adjust the transformation behavior of the @xmath90 s ( that are contracted with the partial derivative acting on the @xmath15-spinor and produce a @xmath15-momentum ) to that of the @xmath123 . or , in other words , the relevant property characterizing the symmetry of the gauge field is the transformation of the phase and not the transformation of the polarization vector .",
    "@xmath132 is a matrix that , when projected on the @xmath15-eigenspaces , encodes the coupling between different @xmath15-sectors .",
    "these vertices then mix different @xmath15-values of fermions and gauge bosons .    if one inserts the field expansion in such a lagrangian , the feynman rules in momentum space are then the normal ones with the following additions :    * every vertex obtains a factor @xmath134 , one @xmath15 for the fermions , one for the gauge boson . *",
    "the external ingoing lines belong to the same @xmath15-subspace .",
    "external outgoing lines also belong to the same @xmath15-subspace , but not necessarily the same as the ingoing ones .",
    "* vertex indices must be matched to the coupling particles transformation behavior .",
    "* sum over all @xmath15 s of virtual particles .    and , as laid out in the previous section , the momenta transform under the respective @xmath27 until measurement , after which they become a @xmath11 four vector .    the amplitudes then have as usual a @xmath135-function for conservation of the four - momentum .",
    "note that the argument of this @xmath135-function @xmath136 from one frame to the next .",
    "it does not differ by a coordinate transformation , it is actually a different argument .",
    "it is only the measurement that one selects one .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , the outcome depends on the frame of the measurement and disagreements are unobservable .",
    "locality can become a problematic concept in theories in which the speed of light can take different values but still observer independence should be fulfilled .",
    "the reason is that with the requirement that different values of speeds remain invariant , space - time points have no well - defined transformation behavior : the location of a point after a change of reference frame depends on which speed is kept invariant . in particular , a point defined in one reference frame by different means though intersecting curves can , after a change of reference frame , split up into various points . for the case of dsr",
    "this has been shown in @xcite .",
    "recent suggestions for how to address the problem have built up to a new ` principle of relative locality ' @xcite .",
    "this approach accepts the arising nonlocality and aims to show it is not problematic after all .",
    "( for some discussion , see also @xcite . )",
    "we too encountered in the previous section the need to transform coordinates depending on the value of @xmath15 , reflected in the set of transformations @xmath27 .",
    "but our approach offers an entirely new solution for the problem .",
    "the observer - independence of the speed of light is now a fundamental property of the evolution of a quantum state , but each single measurement outcome depends on the restframe in which the measurement was made . in particular , a speed of photons different from the average value @xmath11 will after measurement no longer be an invariant of the transformation , but transform under normal lorentz - transformations @xmath52 .",
    "thus , disagreements in different observers definitions of a point due to different invariant speeds are never reflected in actual observables .",
    "the ` box - problem ' discussed in reference @xcite is circumvented because observers never disagree on the outcome of the measurement . in dsr",
    "the particle s worldline transforms under a non - standard lorentz - transformation that is energy - dependent . as a consequence ,",
    "the statement whether three lines meet or do not meet in one point depends on the reference frame , and ( to some precision ) the question whether they meet is a requirement for local interactions to take place . in the scenario discussed here , in contrast , making the measurement in one frame fixes the eigenvalue of the speed and a different observer would interpret the speed to be the _ normal _ lorentz transformation of the speed measured .",
    "the measurement is either made in the laboratory frame , in which case the bomb blows up and the observer in the satellite agrees , or it is made in the satellite frame , in which case the bomb does not blow up and the observer in the lab agrees . the situation is entirely symmetric as long as both frames represent identical measuring processes with some relative velocity .",
    "solving the problem with locality does however not solve the problems with causality that superluminal information exchange creates .",
    "indeed , it seems one has to give one up for the other .",
    "one creates a problem with locality if there exist curves with different transformation behaviors because their intersections can be used to define points .",
    "if one does not accept these non - localities , the need to reproduce sr in the limit of non - quantum objects means that everything that we can plausibly refer to as an observer transforms under normal lorentz - transformations . but a normal lorentz - transformation can turn a superluminal curve into one going backwards in time . in dsr on the other hand ,",
    "the modified transformation behavior of the speed - of - light allows it to remain in the upper , @xmath137 , part of _ each _ reference frame .    to be more precise , the problem with causality is not that a curve that in one reference frame is superluminal seems to be going backwards in time in another frame , because the curve itself does not have a direction . both observers could interpret the particle as moving forward in time but into opposite spatial directions . closed curves in flat minkowski - space",
    "then are not a problem fundamentally ; one just has to demand consistency .",
    "this means if a particle at some time @xmath138 could affect its own earlier curve at @xmath139 , this would have been taken into account at the time @xmath138 already .    as an example , consider the closed curve in figure [ 4 ] , top , and interpret each corner as a scattering event .",
    "one could read this curve as a particle that propagates freely from @xmath140 to @xmath141 , scatters in @xmath141 and produces a particle with superluminal momentum that then moves towards @xmath142 which , in the chosen reference frame is earlier in time than @xmath141 . in @xmath142 and in @xmath143",
    "the particle scatters again , produces an outgoing particle that then intersects with the original particle s previous curve in @xmath140 .",
    "now on the level of elementary particles , this would just mean that the state of the particle at @xmath141 would have had to take into account event @xmath140 already , because it was always there .",
    "we can also read the curve the other way round which ( in the chosen example ) would correspond to some particle going from @xmath142 to @xmath143 , scattering twice and creating to superluminal particles going to @xmath140 and @xmath142 respectively .",
    "however , this does no longer work once we take into account that , for better or worse , our world is evidently not time - reversal invariant and we do have an arrow of time that points somewhere we can for lack of a better word call ` forward . '",
    "problems with causality can no longer simply be solved by demanding consistency in this simple form when we consider macroscopic objects that display an arrow of time because it becomes possible to create paradoxa ( that have been extensively used and abused in the science - fiction literature ) .    to see the difference , consider in @xmath140 you fill out a lottery ticket . on the way to @xmath141",
    "you learn that you did nt win but write down the winning numbers and send them to your friend at @xmath142 .",
    "your friend then , at @xmath143 , sends the numbers back to your earlier self at @xmath140 .",
    "consistency would now demand that you already knew the numbers all the time , in which case you would have won the lottery already and still there was no avoiding that you will send the numbers to your friend . alternatively",
    ", your friend is not able to send you the numbers , or you will not be able to receive them . but apart from that being what consistency demands , it is difficult to see exactly what cosmic conspiracy would prevent you or your friend from sending the numbers back and forth and creating a paradox .",
    "the difference to the case of elementary particles is that this story has a direction of information flow and a notion of ` learning ' .",
    "the process of ` sending ' is different to the process of ` receiving ' because the sender previously knew of the information whereas the receiver does not .",
    "if we time - reverse this process it looks very different .",
    "( one does not untype an email when one receives it . ) for macroscopic objects thus the curve would have to be endowed with arrows indicating a direction , depicted in fig . [ 4 ] , 2nd from top , that inevitably have to run backwards in time somewhere ( in any reference frame ) .",
    "that is what creates the problem .",
    "but this analysis of the problem also contains the seed for its resolution .",
    "since there is no point denying the existence of an arrow of time , we have to take it into account consistently .",
    "recall that in our framework it is only after measurement that the curve of a superluminal particle is subject to sr transformations .",
    "all we have to do is to endow the process of measurement with an arrow of time which comes naturally through the framework of environmentally induced decoherence .",
    "thus , there is an environment that creates an arrow of time , which is a vector field timelike in the @xmath11 frame , that tells us which end of a curve is the emission and which is the detection .",
    "it is then impossible to send information backwards in time in the environment s restframe , and while it is still possible to send it backwards in time in some other frame , it is no longer possible to send information in a closed curve .",
    "instead , the arrows of information flow all have to point forward in some frame , resulting in the situation depicted in fig . [ 4 ] , two bottom figures ( depending on how the depicted @xmath144 relates to the arrow of time ) . concretely",
    ", this means you in @xmath141 can not prepare a state that your friend can measures in @xmath142 , or your friend in @xmath143 can not prepare a state that you measure in @xmath140 .",
    "this of course does introduce a preferred frame .",
    "but note that this preferred frame , one we know exists , arises through interaction with the environment in the measurement processes and is not present through a liv term in the lagrangian .",
    "circumventing of timelike closed curves by requiring consistency of history has become known as `` novikov s self - consistency principle '' @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the simple way that timelike closed loops are prevented here is possible only because we are still dealing with a flat , topologically trivial , background .",
    "the timelike closed curves that occur here can not be geodetic and still intersect with themselves ; they necessitate a change of direction , and thus an interaction , in at least three points .",
    "the reader might be familiar with the self - consistency principle from the general relativistic case , where the issue of timelike closed loops is much more involved , and a solution like the one discussed above is in general not possible , or at least not physically justified .",
    "for some discussion see also @xcite .",
    "it may be of interest to the reader that geroch @xcite has argued on very general grounds that the existence of different causal cones is possible without being in conflict with sr . in geroch s work it was",
    "however not investigated the transformation behavior of these cones and their invariance in particular .",
    "the standard model , and quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) in particular , are extremely well tested theories .",
    "this raises the question how tightly existing experiments constrain the possibility discussed here .",
    "while we will leave details of the phenomenology to be studied in a future work , here we want to discuss some general properties .",
    "since we have never noticed a photon moving with anything else than @xmath11 ( to some precision ) we should expect the probability for photons to propagate in other @xmath15-subspaces to be small , @xmath145 .",
    "let us consider a very simplified case , that in which there is only one other value @xmath146 in addition to @xmath11 . with the convention that @xmath147 ( if not , the factor can be absorbed in the coupling constant ) , we have two remaining free parameters : @xmath148 and @xmath149 in addition to the masses of the @xmath146-fermions which , as we noted earlier , stand in no obvious relation to their masses in the @xmath11-subspace",
    ".    there can be no modification to compton scattering , because both photons and fermions are in the ingoing state .",
    "the amplitude for bhabha scattering between @xmath11-electrons obtains an additional contribution of order @xmath150 and the amplitude for @xmath146-electrons in the outgoing state has a factor @xmath151 .",
    "note however that the same factor comes in again through the amplitude for the detection cross - section .",
    "that is to say , if the particles are difficult to produce , they are also difficult to detect .    a not detected @xmath146-photon or electron would result in missing energy and momentum that does not fulfill the condition @xmath152 .",
    "instead , it would appear to have an apparent mass @xmath153 of @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the ( square of the ) three - momentum in the measurement frame . note that this apparent mass can be imaginary if @xmath156 .",
    "this apparent mass is the mass that we would assign to the particle within special relativity .",
    "the particle s actual mass , which appears in the lagrangian , remains positive and real valued .",
    "however , the best experimental tests of qed come from virtual processes that will yield constraints on the parameters of this model .",
    "the question is whether parameters that fulfill the constraints render the model uninteresting already , which will require further study .",
    "let us summarize the assumptions made here and discuss their relevance .",
    "first , we have assumed that @xmath15 takes on discrete values .",
    "while the formalism presented here can easily be extended to continuous @xmath15-values , it seems more plausible that , if there exist indeed superpositions of different @xmath15 s , the values are discrete , at least in the vicinity of @xmath11 .",
    "if they are not , one would expect the probability to be smooth in the vicinity of @xmath11 .",
    "then , in the absence of a gap in the spectrum , one loses the rationale to use only one particular @xmath15-value , namely @xmath11 for the measurement outcome .",
    "we have further , in section [ setup ] , considered a product state between the particle in some background and the background .",
    "the more general case would be that @xmath69 is a function also of the quantum numbers of the particle @xmath157 .",
    "for one , this would be the outcome of some scattering process in which case @xmath69 would generically depend on all the momenta of scattering particles .",
    "but one may also consider the possibility that @xmath157 is an intrinsic property of the particle .    if @xmath157 is an invariant and intrinsic property of the particle",
    ", then it may be a function of the momentum .",
    "this allows us to relate the here proposed model to dsr . for a photon ,",
    "the only way to obtain a non - trivial ( on shell ) momentum - dependence that is also lorentz - invariant is to use a modified version of transformations in momentum space .",
    "then , the speed of light obtained from the expectation values of energy and momentum may become a function of the particle s energy that in the low energy limit reproduces normal lorentz - symmetry , thereby connecting the here proposed model to dsr .",
    "however , in this case @xmath15 would need to have a continuous spectrum ( since the energy can be continuously redshifted ) .",
    "such a version of the model would still be different from dsr in that the different speeds of light can exist only in superpositions .",
    "we have shown here that , next to lorentz - invariance breaking and deformations of special relativity , there exists a novel third way how departures from lorentz - invariance that may arise in quantum gravitational effects can make themselves noticeable .",
    "the departure from lorentz - invariance proposed here arises from superpositions of different metrics on the same background manifold , so that for each of the metrics the maximally possible and invariant speed of massless particles takes on a different value .",
    "the process of measurement produces observables that obey the laws of special relativity . to preserve causality ,",
    "we have assumed that the measurement does introduce a preferred frame .",
    "this modification of lorentz - invariance makes it unnecessary to introducing lorentz - invariance violating operators , and does not create problems with locality or causality ; at least in flat space .",
    "the here proposed model has phenomenological consequences for particle physics that need to be further explored to find out how tightly the parameters of the model are constrained by available data already .",
