    "it is fairly well established that quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , and in particular quenched qed , breaks chiral symmetry for sufficiently large couplings . this phenomenon has been observed both in lattice simulations  @xcite as well as various studies based on the use of dyson - schwinger equations  @xcite .",
    "these latter calculations have generally relied on the use of a cut - off in euclidean momentum in order to regulate divergent integrals , a procedure which breaks the gauge invariance of the theory .    on the other hand , continuation of gauge theories to @xmath0 dimensions",
    "has long been used as an efficient way to regularize perturbation theory without violating gauge invariance . in nonperturbative calculations , however , the use of this method of regularization is rarely used  @xcite . within the context of the dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) only a few publications  @xcite",
    "have employed dimensional regularization instead of the usual momentum cut - off .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to study dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and the chiral limit within dimensionally regularized quenched qed . we are motivated to do this by the wish to avoid some gauge ambiguities occurring in cut - off based work , which we discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec_motivation ] . in that section",
    "we also outline some general results which one expects to be valid for @xmath0 , independently of the particular vertex which one uses as an input to the dses .",
    "having done this we proceed , in section  [ sec : rainbow ] , with a study of chiral symmetry breaking in the popular , but gauge non - covariant , rainbow approximation .",
    "just as in cut - off regularized work , the rainbow approximation provides a very good qualitative guide to what to expect for more realistic vertices and has the considerable advantage that , with certain additional approximations , one may obtain analytical results .",
    "we check numerically that the additional approximations made are in fact quite justified .",
    "indeed , it is very fortunate that it is possible to obtain this analytic insight into the pattern of chiral symmetry breaking in @xmath3 dimensions as it provides us with a well defined procedure for extracting the critical coupling of the 4 dimensional theory with more complicated vertices .",
    "we proceed to the curtis - pennington ( cp ) vertex in section  [ sec : cp ] . there",
    "we derive , for solutions which do not break chiral symmetry , an integral representation for the exact wavefunction renormalization function @xmath4 in @xmath3 dimensions .",
    "we also provide an approximate , but explicit , expression for this quantity .",
    "the latter is quite useful , in the ultraviolet region , even if dynamical chiral symmetry breaking takes place as it provides a welcome check for the numerical investigation of chiral symmetry breaking with the cp vertex with which we conclude that section .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusion ] , we summarize our results and conclude .",
    "although chiral symmetry breaking appears to be universally observed independently of the precise nature of the vertex used in dse studies , it has also been recognized for a long time that the critical couplings with almost all of these vertices show a gauge dependence which should not be present for a physical quantity . with a bare vertex",
    "this is not surprising as this vertex ansatz breaks the ward - takahashi identity .",
    "however , even with the curtis - pennington ( cp ) vertex , which does not violate this identity and additionally is constrained by the requirement of perturbative multiplicative renormalizability , a residual gauge dependence remains  @xcite .",
    "apart from possible deficiencies of the vertex , which we do not investigate in this paper , the use of cut - off regularization explicitly breaks the gauge symmetry even as the cut - off is taken to infinity .",
    "this is well known in perturbation theory ( see , for example , the discussion of the axial anomaly in sect .",
    "19.2 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) and was pointed out by roberts and collaborators  @xcite in the present context .",
    "the latter authors proposed a prescription for dealing with this ambiguity which ensures that the regularization does not violate the ward - takahashi identity .    as may be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : cut - off alpha_cr ] , this ambiguity has a strong effect on the value of the critical coupling of the theory .",
    "the two curves in that figure correspond to the critical coupling @xmath5 of ref .",
    "@xcite as well as the coupling @xmath6 one obtains by following the prescription of roberts et al .",
    "it is straightforward to show , following the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , that these couplings are related through @xmath7 also plotted in this figure are previously published numerical results  @xcite obtained with both of the above prescriptions .",
    "note that , curiously , the critical couplings obtained with the prescription of ref .",
    "@xcite ( i.e. the calculation which restores the ward - takahashi identity ) exhibits a stronger gauge dependence , at least for the range of gauge parameters shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : cut - off alpha_cr ] .",
    "gauge ambiguities such as the one outlined above are absent if one does not break the gauge invariance of the theory through the regularization procedure .",
    "hence , we now turn to dimensionally regularized ( quenched ) qed .",
    "the minkowski space fermion propagator @xmath8 is defined in the usual way through the dimensionless wavefunction renormalization function @xmath9 and the dimensionful mass function @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath11 the dependence of @xmath4 and @xmath12 on the dimensionality of the space is not explicitly indicated here .",
    "furthermore , note that to a large extent we shall be dealing only with the regularized theory without imposing a renormalization procedure , as renormalization  @xcite is inessential to our discussion .",
    "in addition to the above , we shall consider the theory without explicit chiral symmetry breaking ( i.e. zero bare mass ) .",
    "this theory would not contain a mass scale were it not for the usual arbitrary scale ( which we denote by @xmath13 ) introduced in @xmath14 dimensions which provides the connection between the _ dimensionful _ coupling @xmath15 and the usual _ dimensionless _ coupling constant @xmath16 : @xmath17 as @xmath13 is _ the only _ mass scale in the problem , and as the coupling always appears in the above combination with this scale , on dimensional grounds alone the mass function must be of the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a dimensionless function and in particular @xmath20 moreover , as @xmath21 goes to zero the @xmath13 dependence on the right hand side must disappear and hence the dynamical mass @xmath22 is either zero ( i.e. no symmetry breaking ) or goes to infinity in this limit . this situation is analogous to what happens in cut - off regularized theory , where the scale parameter is the cut - off itself and the mass is proportional it .",
    "note that @xmath23 is not dependent on @xmath24 .",
    "this implies immediately that there can be no non - zero critical coupling in @xmath25 dimensions : if @xmath22 is non - zero for some coupling @xmath24 then it must be non - zero for all couplings .    given these general considerations ( which are of course independent of the particular ansatz for the vertex ) it behooves one to ask how this situation can be reconciled with a critical coupling @xmath5 of order 1 in four dimensions .",
    "in order to see how this might arise , we shall extract a convenient numerical factor out of @xmath19 and suggestively re - write the dynamical mass as @xmath26 at present there is no difference in content between eq .",

    "notwithstanding this , as one knows from cut - off based work that there actually is a non - zero critical coupling for @xmath33 , one can at this stage already come to the conclusion that @xmath31 exists and hence that quenched qed in @xmath0 dimensions has a chiral symmetry breaking solution for all couplings .    in summary ,",

    "the solid line corresponds to the assumption that the leading term in @xmath163 has the same form as what we found in the rainbow approximation , i.e.    @xmath164    with this form the fit parameters @xmath5 and @xmath165 are found to be @xmath166    indeed , the critical coupling is similar to what is found in cut - off based work ( see sec .",

    "however , it is not clear that the functional form suggested by the rainbow approximation should be taken quite this seriously . the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : logmass_vs_inv_epsilon ] corresponds to a fit where the power of @xmath21 of the subleading term has been left free , i.e. @xmath173 the optimum fit assuming this form for @xmath155 yields a power quite different to @xmath174 and a very much smaller @xmath5 : @xmath175    to conclude this section , let us discuss why it is that the functional form of the subleading term @xmath161 appears to be rather important even if @xmath21 is already rather small .",
    "the reason for this is two - fold : most importantly , although the leading @xmath21 dependence of @xmath155 is indeed @xmath156 , the coefficient of this term ( leaving out the trivial @xmath24 dependence ) is @xmath176 . as @xmath5 is rather close to 1 one",
    "therefore obtains a strong suppression of this leading term , increasing the relative importance of the subleading terms .",
    "in addition , it appears as if the numerical results favour a subleading term which is not as strongly suppressed ( as a function of @xmath21 ) as suggested by the rainbow approximation ( i.e. the power of @xmath156 of the subleading term appears to be closer to @xmath177 rather than @xmath174 ) .",
    "this again increases the importance of the subleading terms .",
    "the primary purpose of this paper was to explore the phenomenon of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking through the use of dyson - schwinger equations with a regularization scheme which does not break the gauge covariance of the theory , namely dimensional regularization .",
    "it is necessary to do this as the cut - off based work leads to ambiguous results for the critical coupling of the theory precisely because of the lack of gauge covariance in those calculations . in particular , this should be kept in mind when using the expected gauge invariance of the critical coupling as a criterion for judging the suitability of a particular vertex .    to begin with ,",
    "we have shown on dimensional grounds alone and for an arbitrary vertex , that in @xmath32 dimensions either a symmetry breaking solution does not exist at all ( in which case , however , it would also not exist in @xmath33 dimensions ) or it exists for all non zero values of the coupling ( in which case a chiral symmetry breaking solution exists in @xmath33 for @xmath178 ) . for dyson - schwinger analyses employing the rainbow and cp vertices we have shown that it is the second of these possibilities which is realized .",
    "for these symmetry breaking solutions the limit to @xmath179 is necessarily discontinuous and so the extraction of the critical coupling of the theory ( in 4 dimensions ) is not as simple as in cut - off regularized work .",
    "we next turned to an examination of symmetry breaking in the rainbow approximation in landau gauge , both analytically and numerically . indeed , for this vertex one could rewrite the ( linearized ) dyson - schwinger equation as a schrdinger equation in 4 dimensions and appeal to standard results from elementary quantum mechanics to explicitly show that the theory always breaks chiral symmetry if @xmath180 .",
    "we also showed how the usual critical coupling @xmath181 may be extracted from the dimensionally regularized work .",
    "we concluded this work with an examination of the cp vertex . by making use of the gauge covariance of the theory we derived an exact integral expression for the wavefunction renormalization function @xmath9 of the chirally symmetric solution .",
    "furthermore we obtained a compact expression for this quantity which is an excellent approximation to the true @xmath9 even for solutions which break the chiral symmetry .",
    "finally , we extracted the critical coupling corresponding to this vertex and found that , within errors , it agrees with the standard cut - off results .    in the future",
    ", we plan to increase the numerical precision with which we can extract this critical coupling for the cp vertex by an order of magnitude or so .",
    "the factor limiting the precision at present is that when solving the propagator s dyson - schwinger equation with the cp vertex by iteration the rate of convergence decreases dramatically as @xmath21 is decreased below @xmath182 .",
    "if this increase in precision can be attained it will enable one to make a meaningful comparison with the cut - off based results shown in fig .",

    "for @xmath221 the potential is attractive and for @xmath222 it is always larger than the kinetic energy , so for this case we get dynamical symmetry breaking for any value of @xmath24 .",
    "for example , for @xmath195 , one obtains @xmath223 which coincides precisely with the ground - state energy of the hydrogen atom ( not surprisingly , as we have used the ground - state hydrogen wave function as our trial function ) . in this case",
