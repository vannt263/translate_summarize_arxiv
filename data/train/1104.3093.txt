    "physical and numerical experiments have typically access to , at least , two kinds of observables of the state of a turbulent newtonian fluid .",
    "these observables are , on the one hand , eulerian or lagrangian statistical indicators such as universal scaling properties of correlation and structure functions . on the other hand ,",
    "geometrical indicators like shapes formed by configurations privileged by the dynamics of lagrangian or inertial particles can be observed .",
    "a series of remarkable results ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) have in recent years started to unveil the nature of the link between statistical indicators and geometrical properties .",
    "in particular , @xcite gave clear evidence that tracer particles advected by the @xmath0 navier  stokes velocity field spend anomalously long times in degenerate geometries characterized by strong clustering and that the phenomenon has a quantitative counterpart in the existence of special functions of particle configurations which are on average preserved by flow .",
    "furthermore , it was shown in @xcite for densities transported by compressible turbulent velocity fields that statistical conservation laws determine , at least for integer values of the mass , the multifractal spectrum of the attractor towards which lagrangian trajectories converge . on",
    "the background of these results was the discovery of anomalous scaling @xcite in a stylized model of passive advection , the kraichnan model @xcite .",
    "there it was possible to show in a mathematically controlled fashion @xcite , that the universal statistical properties of the model in the inertial and , under additional hypotheses @xcite , decay ranges are determined by statistical conservation laws of the lagrangian dynamics ( referred to as zero modes ) .",
    "zero modes have subsequently become the object of extensive investigations and analytical , mostly perturbative , and numerical expressions of their scaling exponents have been derived for the kraichnan model and its generalizations ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . to the best of my knowledge , however , quantitative expressions of the scaling exponents explicitly relating them to geometrical properties of lagrangian particle configurations appeared only recently in @xcite .",
    "the scope of the present contribution is to illustrate the new method of calculation introduced in @xcite in the slightly more general case of the compressible kraichnan model @xcite .",
    "the main result of the paper , derived in sections  [ sec : mg ] and [ sec : csd ] , is the classification of zero modes , irreducible and reducible , in terms of gelfand - zetlin patterns ( see e.g. @xcite ) associated to quadratic casimir operators of classical groups",
    ". it must be clearly stated that this classification is perturbative but it has nevertheless the merit to establish an explicit link to lagrangian particle geometry which is discussed in more details for four point correlations in section  [ sec : duality ] .",
    "sections  [ sec : model ] and [ sec : hopf ] recall respectively the defining properties of the kraichnan model and basic facts about the structure of the solution of the hopf equations . in the conclusions",
    "i discuss the use of the new method and make some speculations on its significance for the navier  stokes equation as well as for other statistical field theories .",
    "passive turbulent advection by a _",
    "compressible _ velocity field in @xmath1 encompasses ( see e.g. @xcite ) the density evolution equation @xmath2 ( describing e.g. the distribution of particles floating on the surface of the fluid in the limit of vanishing stokes number ) and the tracer evolution equation @xmath3 ( describing e.g. the fluid temperature ) . at finite molecular viscosity @xmath4 ,",
    "the lagrangian dynamics underlying ( [ model : density ] ) and ( [ model : tracer ] ) are distinct , respectively forward and backward in time . in the _ inviscid limit _ and in the case of advection by a turbulent field stylized by a stationary , time - decorrelated gaussian ensemble they become formally adjoint @xcite and can be discussed in parallel .",
    "these are the working hypotheses of the paper .",
    "in particular , the velocity field in ( [ model : density ] ) , ( [ model : tracer ] ) is modeled by the realizations of kraichnan s zero average gaussian compressible ensemble :    @xmath5    @xmath6    where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 $ ] is the roughness degree of the velocity field , @xmath10 $ ] is the degree of compressibility and @xmath11 some non - universal infra - red cut - off function normalized to the unity for vanishing inverse integral scale @xmath12 .",
    "the force fields @xmath13 , @xmath14 ( gaussian , zero - average and decorrelated in time ) compensate the dissipation , in the inviscid limit only due to the eddy diffusivity generated by the velocity field , in order to let the system attain a galilean invariant steady state .",
    "consistence with hydrodynamics imposes to interpret ( [ model : density ] ) , ( [ model : tracer ] ) advected by the kraichnan ensemble as stochastic partial differential equations in the sense of stratonovich .",
    "the role of the eddy diffusivity appears upon converting ( [ model : density ] ) , ( [ model : tracer ] ) into ito form @xcite .",
    "this latter is for the density @xmath15 and for the tracer @xmath16 the eddy diffusivity in the above equations is specified by @xmath17 which means that taylor s formula @xcite becomes exact in the kraichnan model .",
    "a straightforward application of ito calculus to ( [ model : tracer ] ) shows that the equal time correlation @xmath18 of @xmath19 tracer fields in @xmath1 satisfies the hopf equation ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 an effective forcing term fully specified by the correlation of @xmath14 and by correlation functions @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "the operator @xmath25 can be also regarded as the generator of a multiplicative diffusion process the transition probability @xmath26 whereof obeys    @xmath27    @xmath28    the lagrangian interpretation of @xmath26 is that it is the probability density to find a cluster of @xmath19 inertial particles in @xmath29 at time @xmath30 conditioned upon the event that they reach @xmath31 at a later time @xmath32 .",
    "analogously , the equal time @xmath19-point correlation of the density field satisfies an hopf equation formally adjoint to ( [ hopf : hopf ] ) .",
    "in such a case @xmath26 can be regarded as the solution of the fokker - planck equation @xmath33 with @xmath34 @xmath26 acquires the interpretation of the probability density for a cluster of @xmath19 inertial particle to _ arrive _ in @xmath29 at time @xmath32 conditioned upon the event that they are in @xmath31 at time @xmath35 . the different interpretations of ( [ hopf : tracer ] ) and ( [ hopf : density ] ) stem from the distinct lagrangian dynamics underlying ( [ model : density ] ) , ( [ model : tracer ] ) at finite molecular viscosity @xcite .",
    "whenever the kernel @xmath26 acts on translational invariant functions , the arithmetic average of the lagrangian particle positions is integrated out .",
    "the reduction defines a @xmath36-dimensional subspace of @xmath37 , the translational invariant sector of the theory .",

    "in other words , they are martingales of the wiener process @xcite . * the time integral @xmath73 defines for @xmath61 equal zero only _ local _ martingales ( i.e. harmonic functions ) .",
    "the singularity for @xmath74 , obstructs ( [ hopf : local ] ) absolute integrability and therefore the martingale property .",
    "this fact has important consequences for perturbative investigation of anomalous scaling in the decay range ( scales larger than the integral scale of the forcing for infinite integral scale of the velocity field @xcite ) .",
    "the term martingales @xcite denotes functions of a markov process the shape of which , on average , is preserved by the time evolution : @xmath75 the kernel @xmath76 in ( [ mg : def ] ) is a probability density for @xmath77 at time @xmath78 conditioned upon the occurrence of @xmath79 at time @xmath80 . for forward",

    "is played by stationary pseudo - measure @xmath84 satisfying @xmath85 the relevance of these considerations for the kraichnan model @xcite is that the expansion ( [ hopf : expansion ] ) generically comprises constant martingales @xmath86and stationary pseudo - measures @xmath87 .",

    "scaling prediction for time - dependent martingales can be then read from the prefactor of the logarithmic counter - terms needed to compensate the the @xmath184 dependence in ( [ duality : time ] ) .",
    "the technique illustrated is strongly reminiscent of the operator product expansion @xcite previously also used to perform systematic calculations in the kraichnan model ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the differences are that the role of momentum cut - off s is played by the time and that instead of bases of abstract operator valued fields ( composite operators ) it makes use of a basis of harmonic polynomials or shapes @xmath169 complete on the @xmath185 hypersphere .",
    "these objects have a direct geometrical meaning and can be used in numerical simulations close to controlled or phenomenological gaussian limits to test scaling properties as it was done in @xcite .",
    "a final observation is that , at least in principle , the technique does not require linearity of the statistical field theory in order to be applicable .",
    "the reason is the following . in the thermodynamic formalism of field theory @xcite , connected @xmath19-point correlation functions @xmath186",
    "are reconstructed by solving hopf - like equations of the form @xmath187 where @xmath188 stands for the set of _ proper vertices _ of order two acting on @xmath19-point connected correlation functions .",
    "the functionals @xmath22 s in ( [ end : legendre ] ) are specified by functional derivatives of the legendre transform connecting the free energy @xmath189",
    "( i.e. the generating function of connected correlations ) to the thermodynamic potential ( i.e. the generating function of proper vertices ) .",
    "thus the @xmath22 s depend upon all proper vertices of order less or equal to @xmath19 .",
    "once these latter ones are given , ( [ end : legendre ] ) defines a solvable hierarchy for the connected correlations .",
    "thinking of the @xmath190 s as pseudo - differential operators , the generalization of the method presented in this paper consists in probing the scaling of `` martingales '' associated to the generalized propagators @xmath191 acting on @xmath19-particle functions .",
    "it must be , however , emphasized that deriving expressions of proper vertices is in general a very non - trivial task that can be most often carried out only when perturbative methods are applicable .",
    "discussions with j. bec and a. mazzino are gratefully acknowledged .",
    "this work was supported by the center of excellence `` analysis and dynamics '' of the academy of finland .",
    "a convenient method to remove cut - offs from integrals associated to feynman - diagram is to take the mellin transform with respect to the cut - off ( see e.g. @xcite ) . for the velocity correlation this means @xmath192 with @xmath193 and @xmath194 all non - universal information of the cut - off function",
    "is stored in the residues of the function @xmath195 for @xmath196 .",
    "these residues are , however , of no relevance for universal properties of the system and further description of them is needed .",
    "the scope of this appendix is to apply the mellin transform to the evaluation of the logarithmic asymptotics of the integrals introduced in the main text .",
    "the interested reader is referred to @xcite for more details on this technique .      after taking the mellin",
    "transform with respect to the two cut - off scales @xmath12 and @xmath64 ( [ sa : v0 ] ) becomes @xmath197 the momentum integral can be performed for @xmath198 the asymptotics for @xmath199 corresponds to a shift to the left of the contour of the inverse mellin transform in @xmath200 . in order to extricate the leading order of the asymptotics",
    "it is sufficient to approximate the inverse transform with the residue of the first pole which is encountered for @xmath201 ( @xmath202 ) : @xmath203 finally the limit of vanishing @xmath12 requires shifting the contour of the inverse mellin transform in @xmath204 towards positive values of @xmath205 .",
    "the result is @xmath206      proceeding as above ( [ st : v20 ] ) becomes @xmath208 the momentum integral exists for @xmath209 the asymptotic expression of the logarithmic part of the vertex in the limit ( [ integrals : asympt ] ) is obtained by approximating the inverse mellin transform in @xmath200 with the residues of the poles for @xmath210 and @xmath201 .",
    "the resulting pole in @xmath204 is double with residue @xmath211 with @xmath212 note that whenever acting on translational invariant functions @xmath213",
