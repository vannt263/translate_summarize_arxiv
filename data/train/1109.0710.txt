    "the investigation of black holes is one of the most intriguing subjects in science and black holes have been a subject of investigation for over two centuries . in the last few decades investigations of black holes ranging in mass from sub - atomic masses ( quantum black holes ) to galactic masses",
    "( super massive black holes ; smbhs ) have been carried out ( for more details see the review of * ? ? ? * in this issue and references therein ) .",
    "we are concerned here with smbhs .",
    "we would like to know how these enigmatic objects have grown over cosmic time to the sizes they have today .",
    "it is now recognized that massive galaxies grow through mergers and since it is well established that at least every massive galaxy harbors a supermassive black hole , one can expect the formation of super - massive binary black holes ( smbs ) in the center of galaxies that have undergone major mergers @xcite .",
    "the evolution of smbs following the merger of their parent galaxies was first described by @xcite , and the standard picture of smb evolution is that the smbs separation decreases , first through dynamical friction due to distant stellar encounters , then through gravitational slingshot interactions in which nearby stars are ejected at velocities comparable to the smb orbital velocity when the orbital speed is comparable to the stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "finally , the orbit decays through the emission of gravitational radiation , ultimately leading to coalescence of the binary ( see * ? ? ?",
    "smbs are expected to be among the primary sources of low - frequency gravitational waves detectable by the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these waves will be useful to constraint cosmological parameters and to test general relativity    the gaseous accretion flow which forms around the smbs ( before the coalescence phase ) can be a source of electromagnetic radiation ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the timescale , during which detectable electromagnetic radiation , rises to its maximum is governed by viscous diffusion of gas close to the remnant and ranges from several years to hundreds of decades in the case of smbs .    on the other hand",
    ", the expulsion can take place under special conditions when two smbs merge ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the newly formed smbh created after the merging process can then shoot out of the center of the system at high speed ( so called recoiling bh , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "over the last few years various predictions have been made about the speed at which the hole would be slung away ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the speed has been estimated to be from an order of 100s km s@xmath1 @xcite to several 1000s km s@xmath1 @xcite . in principle",
    ", the speed of the smbh mainly depends on the spin of the coalescencing black holes before merging .",
    "the case where the initial smbh spins lie in the orbital plane is a configuration that leads to the so - called superkick and velocities can be significantly higher .",
    "for example , @xcite found several configurations where the kick - off velocity exceeds @xmath2 15000 km s@xmath1 .",
    "such smbhs would be recoiling in gas - rich galaxy merger remnants , and it has been claimed that one might expect some gas to accrete and produce electromagnetic emission .    putative smb systems ( or kicked - off smbhs ) have been used in explanation of a variety of observations , such as : a ) stellar dynamical models of formation of cores in elliptical galaxies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "so far only one study has considered the possibility that the line intensity ratio may be used as an indicator of an smb s presence .",
    "@xcite investigated the spectral properties of the blr in one smbh that is a member of a sub - parsec smb .",

    "* ) .    in the first case , it is not hard to see ( from eq .",
    "1 ) that the motion of ecs will be affected only if the distances between the two bhs are small and only if the ecs are close to the both of the objects .",
    "smbs with very low mass ratios ( e.g. , @xmath34 ) can not form in mergers of galaxies , since the dynamical friction time - scale is too long for the smaller smbh to sink into the galactic center within a hubble time @xcite .",
    "line shifts ( see eq .",
    "3 ) can be seen only with the @xmath28 object , but there is major problem with whether such small mass object can still have an emitting line region . in general",
    "the more massive bh picks up almost all gas infalling into the center . on the other hand ,",
    "the emission that is coming from the smaller bh is unlikely to be intense enough to be comparable with emission of the regions around @xmath27 .",
    "it will therefore only make a very small ( negligible ) contribution to the emission of the more massive bh .",
    "we do not expect that smbs with @xmath34 will have a noticeable affect on line profiles .    in the second case ,",
    "where the mass ratio is closer to unity , the geometry ( or motion ecs ) might be affected by the complex gravitational potential , and there can be various situations which depend on the angle of view of an observer and the distances between super - massive black holes .    in the case @xmath32 the distance between the bhs plays a significant role .",
    "there can be following situations : ( i ) the black holes are far away ( on kpc scale for the nlr and pc , or even sub - pc scale for the blr ) so that each of them has an undisturbed agn structure ( i.e. , each of smbhs has the accretion disk and blr / nlr ) , ( ii ) there are so called `` semi - detached '' systems ( see fig .",
    "[ f - bh ] ) in this scenario the emission - line gas circulates from one bh to another , but the inner accretion disks ( emitting in the soft x - ray region ) are still un - disturbed .",
    "( iii ) the distances are so small that there are binary smbhs surrounded by a common envelope @xcite . in the case ( iii )",
    "we might expect a high spectral ( quasi - periodical ) variability , especially the x - ray band ( see in more details * ? ? ?",
    "* and reference therein ) .",
    "it seems that two cases are perspective to be detected by agn emission lines , the case i ) and ii ) , but also it depends on the so called phase ( the position of the two emitting regions with regard to the observer sight of view ) of a binary system and inclination of the orbit .",
    "the influence of the phase on the line profile for case i ) has been considered in a toy model given by @xcite and depending of the mass ratio and the phase of a binary system the broad profiles can be different , from two - peaked ( if there is no eclipsing between the objects ) to the asymmetrical line profiles .",
    "this also depends on the velocity of the smbhs and their periods ( see in more details * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "note here that small eccentricity of the orbits could not significantly change the estimated parameters .      due to the gravitational interactions , an emission region may be destroyed or deformed , as , e.g. , if the distance between smbhs is of the order of magnitude or closer than dimensions of the emission region . in this case , the emission in lines can be complex , but here we will not consider this case . here",
    "we will discuss only if line emitting regions are present in both or only in one smbh ( associated with one smbh of smbs or with recoiling smbh ) .",
    "let us first estimate the minimal distances between smbhs for which the emission regions could still exist .",
    "considering that gravitational interaction decreases with distances as @xmath35 , there is necessarily that distances between smbhs are significantly larger than sizes of the emitting regions .",
    "consequently , the distances between the smbhs in the system should be at least two order of magnitude larger than the size of the emission region .    to give some estimates of the characteristic distances",
    ", we took into account the estimated sizes of the line emitting regions in agns : the fe k@xmath0 line is coming from the innermost region ( several to several 100s gravitational radii ) , and dimensions are of the order of @xmath36 pc @xcite .",
    "the broad line region is more extensive , at least an order of magnitude and we assumed dimensions of @xmath37 pc @xcite and at the end , the nlr can be significantly extensive ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) from several pc ( we took 10 pc ) to several kpc ( we took 1kpc ) .",
    "taking different scales , one can expect that different emission region will be affected in smbs and consequently different effects will be present in the line profiles .",
    "beside mentioned emitting regions , according to the standard unification model of agn , it is expected that the material feeding the agn ( in the case of a single smbh ) is in the form of a torus ( see * ? ? ?",
    "expected dimensions of the torus are several pc ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , therefore , in the sub - pc scale smbs one can not expect a classical torus .",
    "however , the surrounding gas formed in the interaction of smbhs can play a role ( similar as a torus ) in feeding the agn , i.e. provide material for accrete onto each of the smb components ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .    in table [ t01 ]",
    "we give three characteristic interval of distances between smbhs with respect to the dimension of the fe k@xmath0 , broad and narrow line emitting regions .",
    "also in the table [ t01 ] we give estimates for the maximal radial velocities of components and their orbiting periods for characteristic distances .",
    "the estimates are given for the smb system with the same mass of @xmath38 .",
    "it is interesting to compare the typical fwhm of lines from three emitting regions with the corresponding maximal radial velocity .",
    "as it can be seen , the maximal radial velocities ( orbits are edge - on ) are in principle smaller than fwhm .",
    "it seems that is very unlikely to see clearly split lines , rather one can expect asymmetry or peaks in the line profile . as an illustration in fig .",
    "[ f - sp ] we simulate the composite broad h@xmath9 line ( one agn j00063 + 2012 ) , taking that the same spectra are coming from a binary blr with velocities of 250 km s@xmath1 each ( or estimated distance between them around 3.6 pc if orbit is edge - on oriented ) and 600 km s@xmath1 ( distance between components is around 0.625 pc for the edge - on oriented orbit ) ; as it can be seen from the figure , in the first case we can not see any influence of smbs on line shapes , and in the second case , only two peaks can be registered in the line profile .",
    "on the other hand , due to periodical orbiting of the binary , the periodical ( or rather quasi - periodical ) spectral oscillations may be present in the fe k@xmath0 line ( from several hours to several days ) and also in the broad lines ( order from several days to several hundred of years ) .",
    "moreover , the gas can periodically transfer from the circumbinary disk to the black holes when the binary is on an eccentric orbit and produce periodical oscillations in the electromagnetic spectra ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "consequently , variability in the line profile due to different position and radial velocity of the smb components , and periodical transfer of gas is expected to be observed .",
    "considering a smb system , one should take into account possibility that one ( or both of the two smbhs ) in the system has a gaseous blr that emits the broad , permitted lines , typical for quasar spectra .",
    "the orbital motion of the smb causes the lines to shift periodically making the spectrum analogous to that of a single- or double - lined spectroscopic binary star @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that close supermassive binary black holes could be detected through their effect on the broad line profiles . in the first instance , displaced broad line peaks could be a consequence of the orbital motions of close binary black holes ( see figs .",
    "[ f001 ] and [ f002 ] ) .",
    "one of the first candidate for the smb system was 3c390.3 @xcite .",
    "moreover , an observed systematic drift of the blue - shifted , broad h@xmath9 peak in the spectrum of 3c 390.3 between 1968 and 1988 was consistent with the smb hypothesis @xcite .",
    "but reverberation mapping of 3c 390.3 , however , showed that on a light - crossing timescale the red and blue peaks varied near simultaneously ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and the other effects seen in the line profiles indicated disc origin ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this strongly rules out binary black holes as the cause of the displaced peaks in this object .",
    "it is likely that disk emission is present in the double peaked ( and strongly asymmetric ) emitters ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the line profiles were fitted by a disk model by @xcite and they found that additional emission is present ; there is a central blue and central peak in addition to the disk emission ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - g ] ) .",
    "moreover , @xcite found from new vla imaging at 8.5 ghz , two faint sources and they found that the double may be energized here by the candidate 0.1 pc smb system or the radio emission may arise from a binary system of quasars with a projected separation of 5.1 kpc , and the two quasars may produce the two observed broad - line emission systems . also , @xcite presented the pc - scale radio imaging ( with european vlbi network ) of sdss j1536 + 0441 . at 5 ghz , with the resolution of @xmath210 mas ( @xmath250 pc ) .",

    "as we mentioned above , the mass ratio is very important in the dynamics of the smbs , and the investigation performed by @xcite showed that ( 1.5%@xmath450.6% ) of the total number of nearby agns for the equal - mass ratio and ( 1.3%@xmath450.5% ) for the one - to - ten mass ratio have close binary massive black holes with an orbital period of less than 10 yr .",
    "note here that such objects may be detectable with ongoing highly sensitive x - ray ( see table [ t01 ] and discussion further in the text ) .",
    "it is interesting if all smbs have the equal - mass ratio then one can expect that about 10% of agns with black - hole masses of 10@xmath56 have close binaries @xcite .",
    "this provides a good chance to detect such systems .    concerning recoiling smbhs",

    "@xcite found an upper limits on the incidence of recoiling black holes in qsos of only 0.2% for kicks with velocities greater than 800 km s@xmath1 , and significantly smaller for higher velocities ( e.g. , 0.08% for kicks",
    "greater than 2000 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "the probability to observe blr from smbs derived from observations of broad emission lines are significantly lower .",
    "e.g. , @xcite presented the results of a systematic search for massive black hole binaries in the sdss spectroscopic database , taking some constraints ( see * ? ? ? * ) and for a sample of 54586 quasars and 3929 galaxies at redshifts @xmath57 only nine possible candidates for smbs are selected .",
    "some better score of 14 candidates was find in @xcite .",
    "this give an experimental result of an order of 0.02% candidates from the sdss datebase .",
    "such difference between predictions and discovered smb candidates may be explained with the fact that the broad emission line profiles ( emitted from binary smbhs ) are mostly asymmetric and with a small radial velocity drift ( see fig .",

    "this may indicate that we observe a number of binary smbhs supposing that they are ordinary agns .",

    "they did not find any double cores , this does not substantially support the idea that agns with double - peaked optical emission lines contain binary black holes .",
    "there are processes which can result in double peaked narrow lines ( as e.g. , outflow , or systematic motion of gas , etc .",

    "let us discuss the possibility to detect a recoiling smbh and sub - parsec smb using nels .",
    "in the case of a recoiling smbh , the accretion disk , formed around kicked off smbh , is illuminating the gas @xcite in its former host galaxy from the outside .",
    "the narrow emission lines arise from gas predominantly orbiting in the potential of the host galaxy and will not follow the recoiling smbh @xcite .",
    "the recoiling smbh may also ionize the gas from host galaxy , producing narrow emission lines , and forming an nlr different from one emitted by the nlr of host galaxy .",
    "in this case one should expect complex line ratios and widths , and split between in the narrow lines .    on the other hand ,",
    "if a smb system is embedded by the low density gas , the gas ( nlr ) will be illuminated by two sources , and a high anisotropy in the nlr is expected .",
    "this can lead to different line ratios than in the case where gas is illuminated by only one source .",
    "additionally , perturbation in the gas inside the nlr ( where orbiting of the binary is expected ) may affect the kinematics of the outher part of the nlr , i.e. , a complex velocity field in the nlr may be present , and consequently it would result in the complex narrow line shapes . note here the case of mrk 553 , where vlti radio observations of the central part recognized overall s - shaped pattern that ( beside of compact radio jet in the center ) might be a black hole merger @xcite .",

    "<S> it is now agreed that mergers play an essential role in the evolution of galaxies and therefore that mergers of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) must have been common . </S>",
    "<S> we see the consequences of past supermassive binary black holes ( smbs ) in the light profiles of so - called ` core ellipticals ' and a small number of smbs have been detected . </S>",
    "<S> however , the evolution of smbs is poorly understood . </S>",
    "<S> theory predicts that smbs should spend a substantial amount of time orbiting at velocities of a few thousand kilometers per second . </S>",
    "<S> if the smbs are surrounded by gas observational effects might be expected from accretion onto one or both of the smbhs . </S>",
    "<S> this could result in a binary active galactic nucleus ( agn ) system . like a single agn , such </S>",
    "<S> a system would emit a broad band electromagnetic spectrum and broad and narrow emission lines .    </S>",
    "<S> the broad emission spectral lines emitted from agns are our main probe of the geometry and physics of the broad line region ( blr ) close to the smbh . </S>",
    "<S> there is a group of agns that emit very broad and complex line profiles , showing two displaced peaks , one blueshifted and one redshifted from the systemic velocity defined by the narrow lines , or a single such peak . </S>",
    "<S> it has been proposed that such line shapes could indicate an smb system . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss here how the presence of an smb will affect the blrs of agns and what the observational consequences might be .    </S>",
    "<S> we review previous claims of smbs based on broad line profiles and find that they may have non - smb explanations as a consequence of a complex blr structure . because of these effects it is very hard to put limits on the number of smbs from broad line profiles . </S>",
    "<S> it is still possible , however , that unusual broad line profiles in combination with other observational effects ( line ratios , quasi - periodical oscillations , spectropolarimetry , etc . ) </S>",
    "<S> could be used for smbs detection .    </S>",
    "<S> some narrow lines ( e.g. , [ oiii ] ) in some agns show a double - peaked profile . </S>",
    "<S> such profiles can be caused by streams in the narrow line region ( nlr ) , but may also indicate the presence of a kilo - parsec scale mergers . </S>",
    "<S> a few objects indicated as double - peaked narrow line emitters are confirmed as kpc - scale margers , but double - peaked narrow line profiles are mostly caused by the complex nlr geometry .    </S>",
    "<S> we briefly discuss the expected line profile of broad fe k@xmath0 that probably originated in the accretion disk(s ) around smbs . </S>",
    "<S> this line may also be very complex and indicate the complex disk geometry or / and an smb presence .    </S>",
    "<S> finally we consider rare configurations where a smb system might be gravitationally lensed by a foreground galaxy , and discuss the expected line profiles in these systems .    </S>",
