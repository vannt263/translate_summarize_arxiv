    "dynamical systems are used to study phenomena from diverse disciplines of science such as laser physics , population ecology , socio - economic studies and many more .",
    "the corresponding mathematical models have often the form of balance equations , in which the time evolution of the state variables is determined by gain and loss terms .",
    "depending on the processes that are taken into account , a single state variable can be effected by several gains and losses . in the modeling process",
    "the modeler usually decides first which processes are important and need to be included in the model .",
    "these processes determine the structure of the model . in the second step",
    "each of the terms is described by a specific mathematical function , which can be based on theoretical reasoning or empirical evidence . in this way",
    "a _ specific model _ for the phenomenon under consideration is constructed .",
    "the investigation of specific models is a powerful approach , that has , in many cases , revealed interesting insights .",
    "however , the specific mathematical functions on which these models are based depend critically on the modelers knowledge of the system . while the modeler may have much information about certain processes , others may be known or believed to exist which are very difficult to quantify .",
    "specific models are therefore often based on a large number of assumptions .",
    "this can be illustrated very well by considering an example from ecology : the so - called holling type - ii function is regularly used to describe the predator - prey interaction in food webs and food chains@xcite .",
    "this function takes major biological effects into account .",
    "but , it can not possibly capture all the subtle biological details that exist in nature .",
    "such details may involve the formation of swarms to confuse predators , adaptation of the prey to high predator densities , density dependent changes in the predator s foraging strategy to name a few . in models such details are often omitted on purpose since the modeler is interested in general insights that do not depend on specific properties of the system under consideration .",
    "but on the other hand , certain details may have a strong impact on the qualitative behavior of the system .",
    "for instance , it has been shown that even minor variations in the functional form of the predator - prey interaction can have a strong impact on the system s stability @xcite .",
    "in contrast to specific functional forms , the basic structure of the system is much easier to determine .",
    "for instance in our ecological example it is easier to say that the predation depends on the population density of predator and prey than to derive the exact functional form that quantifies this dependence .",
    "it can therefore be useful to consider _ generalized models _ which describe the structure of a system in terms of gains and losses but do not restrict these processes to specific functional forms .",
    "if a system is considered in which some processes are known with a high degree of certainty while others remain uncertain it can be useful to study partially generalized models in which some processes are described by specific functional forms , while others remain general .",
    "in other cases fully generalized models in which all processes are modeled by generalized functions can be advantageous .",
    "generalized models describe systems with a higher generality than specific models .",
    "they depend on less assumptions and enable the researcher to consider the system from an abstract point of view .    despite the generality of generalized models",
    ", it is possible to compute the stability of a steady state in these models analytically .",
    "this reveals the exact relationship between the qualitative features of functional forms and the local bifurcations of steady states @xcite . in this way",
    "the application of generalized models enables us to investigate the local stability of systems with a high degree of generality .",
    "moreover , we can draw certain conclusions on the global dynamics of the system under consideration .",
    "for instance , the presence of chaotic or quasiperiodic dynamics as well as the existence of homoclinic bifurcations can be deduced form certain local bifurcations of higher codimension . in this way",
    "the presence of chaotic dynamics can be shown for a whole class of model systems @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a universal approach to the investigation of generalized models based on balance equations .",
    "we illustrate this approach using three models from three different fields of science : socio - economics , laser physics and population dynamics .",
    "these examples demonstrate that the proposed approach can be used to study a wide range of systems .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "we introduce our approach by considering a simple socio - economic model in sec .",
    "[ secsocial ] .",
    "the underlying principles of the normalization procedure are discussed in more detail while we study a coupled laser system in sec .",

    "chinese history is characterised by repeated transitions from despotism to anarchy and back @xcite .",
    "this periodic behavior is known as the dynastic cycle . as a young dynasty rises from anarchy",
    "a period of order and prosperity begins . as a result the population grows . at some point",
    "the aging dynasty can not control the growing population any longer .",
    "the results are poverty , crime and civil war which lead back to a period of anarchy .",
    "by contrast , european dynasties exhibit stable behavior for extended periods of time .    it has been shown in @xcite that the existence of dynastic cycles as well as steady state behavior ( e.g. stable dynasties ) can be predicted by a simple three - variable model that describes the evolution of a society of farmers @xmath0 , bandits @xmath1 and rulers @xmath2 .",
    "the dynamics of this model have been investigated in @xcite . in these investigations",
    "a specific model was used in which the interactions between the different social groups were described by specific functions . in the following we study a generalized version of this model in which the interactions are described by general functions .      in the model",
    "the growth of the population of farmers is described by a function @xmath3 .",
    "this function represents agricultural production , but also losses because of natural mortality including diseases .",
    "the population of farmers is reduced by crime @xmath4 and taxes @xmath5 .",
    "since the bandits profit from the crime their number is assumed to increase proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "in addition crime increases the willingness of the farmers to support rulers",
    ". therefore the number of rulers also grows proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "the rulers fight crime by reducing the number of bandits .",
    "this effect of the rulers on the bandit population is described by a function @xmath6 . finally , we take into account that the numbers of rulers and bandits decrease because of retirement and natural mortality .",
    "this loss is denoted by @xmath7 for the bandits and @xmath8 for the rulers .",
    "taking all these factors into account one obtains differential equations of the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are constant factors .",
    "so far we have formulated a generalized version of the model proposed in @xcite .",
    "in general the investigation of such a model would start with the computation of steady states .",

    "this assumption is in general valid in a large parameter range .",
    "we denote the population densities in this steady state by @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively .",
    "let us now consider the local asymptotic stability of the steady state under consideration . in a system of autonomous ordinary differential equations ( odes ) , such as eq .",

    "but , we know that the steady state under consideration is located at @xmath32 in the normalized model .",
    "one could argue that the normalization procedure is merely a transformation of difficulties : in order to perform the normalization we had to introduce the scale parameters that again depend on the unknown steady state .",
    "however , in the following we show that the scale parameters can be easily interpreted in the context of the model .",
    "that means , the values of the scale parameters can be determined by measurements or theoretical reasoning rather than explicit computation . in this way",

    "the parameter @xmath28 is defined as the per - capita growth rate of the bandits . at the same time it has to be the per - capita rate at which bandits disappear ( to prison , retirement or death ) .",
    "consequently , we could write @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the typical length of a bandits career . in the same way @xmath25 is related to the typical length of a rulers career .    the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 quantify the relative importance of certain processes .",
    "we have defined @xmath29 as the per - capita loss rate of farmers because of crime divided by the total per - capita loss rate .",

    "for instance in the specific model studied by @xcite the natural mortality rate of the bandits is modeled by the function @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a constant parameter . according to our normalization procedure ( see eq .",
    "( [ eqsocialfunc ] ) ) the corresponding normalized function is simply @xmath40 therefore the exponent parameter is @xmath41 regardless of the value of @xmath39 . in a similar way it can be shown that any specific function of the form @xmath42 corresponds to an exponent parameter @xmath43 since we have normalized all functions in the same way , this does not only hold for the mortality term @xmath7 but for all functions in the model . for all processes that can be modeled with monomial expressions the exponent parameters are therefore identical to the exponent of the mononomial .",
    "if a process is not described by a mononomial then the corresponding exponent parameter still measures the nonlinearity of the process in the steady state .",
    "consider for instance the specific function @xmath44 that is employed in @xcite to describe crime .",
    "in this case our normalization procedure yields the exponent parameter @xmath45 that means the parameter is almost one for @xmath46 where @xmath47 is almost linear in @xmath12 .",
    "but , it vanishes for @xmath48 where @xmath47 is almost constant in @xmath12 . for more examples of exponent parameters for specific functional forms",
    "see @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will not assume that @xmath4 or @xmath7 have any specific functional form .",
    "but , we will use the insights gained from the consideration of specific funtional forms to interpret the exponent parameters .",
    "this interpretation reveals realistic ranges and values for these parameters .",
    "for instance , the parameter @xmath49 measures the nonlinearity of the total production rate as a function of the number of farmers . in a country",
    "in which empty land of sufficient quality is available we can assume that the productivity increases linearly with the number of farmers .",
    "in this case we have @xmath50 .",
    "however , if the production is not limited by the number of farmers , but by the lack of usable land then the production is a constant function of the number of farmers .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath51 .",
    "we can therefore interpret @xmath49 as an indicator for the availability of usable land in the steady state .",
    "using the scale and exponent parameters the jacobian of the system can be written as @xmath52 one of the parameters @xmath53 can always be set to one by means of timescale normalization .",
    "this leaves us with 13 parameters . for comparison",
    "the specific model proposed in @xcite contains 11 parameters .",
    "the jacobian which we have obtained in the previous section enables us to compute the stability of the steady states . in general the stability properties of dynamical systems",
    "change abruptly at critical parameter values which are known bifurcation points@xcite .",
    "let us focus on the bifurcations that are encountered as one parameter is changed . of these local codimension-1 bifurcations only two types exist . the first type is characterised by the presence of a single zero eigenvalue of the jacobian . in this paper",
    "we refer to these bifurcations collectively as _ bifurcations of saddle - node type_. these bifurcations generally correspond to the emergence or destruction of equilibiria or the exchange of stability properties between two equilibria .",
    "some examples of this type of bifurction are the saddle - node bifurcation , the transcritical bifurcation or the pitchfork bifurcation .",
    "the bifurcations of saddle - node type can be found analytically by demanding that the determinant of the jacobian vanishes .",
    "the other type of local codimension-1 bifurcation is the hopf bifurcation .",
    "a hopf bifurcation point is characterised by the presence of two purely imaginary eigenvalues of the jacobian in the steady state . in this bifurcation",
    "the steady state becomes unstable as a limit cycle emerges or vanishes . in order to compute this bifurcation",
    "we use the method of resultants @xcite .",
    "although this method yields explicit analytical results the corresponding formulas are too lengthy to be presented here . instead , the bifurcations are shown in a three - parameter bifurcation diagram in fig .",
    "[ figsocial ] .",
    "is increased the stability is lost as a hopf bifurcation ( dark surface ) or a bifurcation of saddle - node type ( light surface ) is crossed .",
    "the hopf bifurcation gives rise to oscillatory behavior that is known as the dynastic cycle .",
    "the fraction of farmer s losses that occur because of crime @xmath29 and the fraction of the bandits that get eventually caught @xmath30 have only a weak effect on the stability of the dynasty .",
    "[ figsocial],width=302,height=226 ]    in the figure the steady state under consideration is stable in the top - most volume of the parameter space .",
    "the stability of the steady state is lost in a hopf bifurcation or in a bifurcation of saddle - node type .",
    "since these bifurcations are of codimension one , the corresponding bifurcation points form hyper - surfaces in the parameter space . for the model under consideration",
    "the hopf bifurcation surface is of particular interest . as this bifurcation surface",
    "is crossed the steady state becomes unstable while a limit cycle emerges .",
    "this gives rise to the dynastic cycle that is observed in simulations .",
    "the fact that the bifurcation surface lies almost perpendicular to the direction of @xmath49 indicates that this parameter is of greater importance for the stability of the system than @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "although such insights should be confirmed in a more careful mathematical investigation , they illustrate that bifurcation analysis of generalized models can be used to identify important parameters in a system .",
    "the scale and exponent parameters which we have defined above capture only the local behavior of the generalized model . the bifurcation analysis which we can perform",
    "is therefore limited to the investigation of local bifurcations .",
    "nevertheless , this analysis enables us to draw certain conclusions on the global dynamics of the generalized model .",
    "for example in fig .",
    "[ figsocial ] there is a line in which the hopf bifurcation surface intersects the bifurcation surface of saddle - node type .",
    "the points on such a line are codimension-2 gavrilov - guckenheimer bifurcation points .",
    "the existence of these points implies that a region of complex ( chaotic or quasiperiodic ) dynamics exists generically in the model @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is shown in @xcite that chaotic dynamics appear in a specific version of the generalized model considered here .",
    "in summary we can say that the investigation of generalized models allows us to generalize insights from specific models .",
    "in particular , generalized models can be used to investigate the local dynamics ( e.g. emergence of dynastic cycle from a hopf bifurcation ) , to identify important parameters ( e.g. availability of land @xmath49 ) and to draw certain conclusions on the global dynamics ( e.g. the existence of complex dynamics ) .",
    "in the previous section we have shown that the local bifurcations of generalized models can be computed efficiently if the model is normalized in a certain way .",
    "this approach can be summarized in form of the following algorithm :    1 .   formulation of a generalized model 2 .",
    "normalization * define normalized variables and functions * rewrite model in terms of the normalized quantities * identify scale parameters 3 .",
    "computation of the jacobian * define exponent parameters * interpret the exponent parameters * compute the entries of the jacobian matrix 4 .",
    "bifurcation analysis , ",
    "we argue that essentially the same procedure can be applied to a large variety of different systems which can be described in the form of balance equations . in order to demonstrate this point we consider a system of coupled lasers .",
    "although the scientific background is entirely different , it turns out that the laser model can be treated in the same way as the socio - economic model . for the analysis presented here the most striking difference between the physical and the socio - economic model",
    "is the amount of available information . in the socio - economic model",
    "all processes are difficult to quantify and are therefore candidates for generalization .",
    "by contrast , the underlying quantum mechanical foundations of laser physics are well understood .",
    "many of the processes in the model can therefore be quantified with a high degree of certainty .",
    "nevertheless , it can be useful to generalize certain processes which can be in principle quantified , but depend on many details of the specific system under consideration . in the following",
    "we show that the algorithm outlined above can be applied in such a partially generalized system .",
    "models from laser physics are among the classical applications of the theory of dynamical systems @xcite . in particular coupled lasers are known to exhibit interesting dynamics .",
    "the investigation presented here is inspired by the theoretical and experimental results reported in @xcite . in this work",

    "the term @xmath64 represents spontaneous emission into the laser mode .",
    "the final term @xmath65 corresponds to stimulated emission .",
    "the quantities @xmath62 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 that appear in these equations are assumed to be constants .",
    "spontaneous or stimulated emission of photons into the laser mode of laser @xmath56 increases the intensity @xmath57 .",
    "this is described by the first two terms in the intensity equations .",
    "the third terms in these equations models the optical coupling of the lasers .",
    "the specific functional form of these terms as well as the equation that governs the evolution of the phase difference are results of stratonovich calculus @xcite . in these equations",
    "the constant @xmath69 describes the strength of the coupling .",
    "the parameter @xmath70 is the cavity round trip time and @xmath71 is the difference of the phase velocity of the lasers without coupling .",
    "the only general function that appears in the model equations is @xmath72 .",
    "this function is used to describe the loss of laser intensity .",
    "photons can be lost from the laser mode because of the absorbtion in the medium or because of escape from the resonator .",
    "nonlinear optical effects like multi - photon absorbtion introduce nonlinearities in the intensity dependence of absorbtion inside the resonator @xcite .",
    "other nonlinear effects , like for instance temperature dependence or intensity dependence of the refractive index can effect the goodness of the resonator . as a consequence",
    "the losses of intensity can depend nonlinearly on the intensity .",
    "while all of these effects can be quantified for a specific laser medium , this would yield a complicated model that describes only one very specific type of laser . in many models studied in literature",
    "it is instead assumed that the losses depend linearly on the intensity of the laser .",
    "let us now normalize the generalized model formulated above .",
    "we start by assuming that there is at least one steady state .",

    "we could argue that @xmath59 is already an easily observable and interpretable variable , therefore the steady state value @xmath74 can be treated as a scale parameter .",

    "while these analyses have provided many interesting results it has often been argued that not all of the randomly created matrices are biologically reasonable @xcite .",
    "the jacobian of a generalized food web of given size can be studied in a similar way . by choosing the scale and exponent parameters",
    "randomly from suitable distributions one can create a set of random but realistic jacobians .",
    "these jacobians can then be studied by the numerical computation of eigenvalues .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that random matrices with certain ecological properties can be created . in this way one can for instance investigate the impact of ecological effects like intraspecific competition or cannibalism on the stability of the system .",
    "although these investigations are certainly promising they require a much more detailed analysis and are therefore beyond the scope of the current paper .",
    "in this paper we propose an approach to the investigation of generalized models which can be formulated in form of balance equations . in these equations gain and loss terms determine the time evolution of the state variables of the system under consideration .",
    "the proposed normalization procedure enables the researcher to consider a system from an abstract point of view .",
    "this abstractness is caused by the way in which variables and functions are normalized .",
    "the normalization procedure separates the necessary information about the steady state ( the scale parameters ) from the information about the nonlinearities in the model ( the exponent parameters ) . in this way it becomes possible to study the effect of the nonlinearities independently from the location of the steady state .",
    "apart from enabling us to investigate generalized models , this separation of scale and exponent variables has other advantages .",
    "for instance the elements of the jacobians that are derived in this way are generally relatively simple .",
    "more importantly , it is in almost all models possible to identify the parameters in such a way that they are easily interpretable in the context of the model . in many cases the general parameters are more directly accessible to measurements than the specific parameters that are normally used in modeling . in @xcite",
    "it has been shown that the identification of the general parameters can in itself provide new insights .    the basic idea behind the proposed approach is to consider the bifurcations as functions of a new set of parameters which only encode as much information as is needed to construct the jacobian . in this way we avoid the computation of steady states , which is in many cases more complicated than the computation of bifurcations once the jacobian is known .",
    "this enables us to compute the local bifurcation surfaces analytically ( using computer algebra systems ) as a function of the scale and exponent parameters . as a result",
    "one is able to investigate the role of the nonlinearities in the gain and loss terms independently from the magnitude of these terms . in other words , one can study , with a high degree of generality , which functional forms of the gain and loss terms yields which dynamical behavior .",
    "thus , this approach provides a bridge between modeling and stability analysis in dynamical systems theory .",
    "the focus of the bifurcation analysis is the computation of local codimension-1 bifurcation of the normalized steady state .",
    "but , as a byproduct of this analysis we obtain the local bifurcations of higher codimension , which can reveal many insights about the dynamics in the neighborhood of these bifurcations .",
    "for instance the presence of a codimension-2 double hopf bifurcation is an indicator for chaotic dynamics .",
    "although our analysis is purely local , it can therefore reveal insights on the global dynamics of the system .",
    "in particular it can indicate regions in parameter space where complex dynamics can be expected .",
    "this insight can be used to prove the generic existence of chaotic parameter regions in generalized models or to locate interesting regions for subsequent numerical investigation .    at present",
    "there are only few results on the implications of local bifurcations of codimension larger than two .",
    "however , the opinion has often been expressed that this line of mathematical research would benefit from more examples from physical applications @xcite .",
    "the approach proposed here provides physicist with a tool for finding these examples . in return",
    ", new mathematical results on the implications of bifurcations of higher codimension can be applied directly to the investigation of generalized models of physical systems . in this way",
    ", the investigation of generalized models may lead to more efficient transport of mathematical discoveries into physical applications and back .",
    "our approach to the investigation of generalized models is purely determistic .",
    "noise and stochastic environmental fluctuations can not be accomodated adequately in the models considered here .",
    "however , the aim of the proposed approach is not to predict the time evolution of a given system , but rather to gain a general understanding of the functioning of a class of models . for systems with a low or moderate level of noise",
    ", the investigation of deterministic generalized models can still be useful , since it is unlikely that the presense of noise alters the local bifurcation structure qualitatively in this case .",
    "the abstract nature of the proposed analysis becomes apparent if one considers that we did not have to specify which steady state we consider . in a system",
    "in which multiple steady states exist the derived bifurcation diagram does therefore describe all of these steady states simulateously .",
    "this insight can for instance be used to prove general statements of the type : `` there can not be a stable steady state with  '' .    in this paper ,",
    "the main tool for the investigation of the derived jacobians was bifurcation analysis .",
    "however , we have already remarked in our final example that the jacobians can also be used in other ways . in particular large systems may contain too many parameters to be analysed efficiently with bifurcation diagrams . for these systems",
    "our method can be used in the random - matrix - like context , which is described in sec .",
    "[ secfoodweb ] . in this light ,",
    "the proposed method can be seen as a link between the very general random matrix approach and specific models .",
    "finally , let us remark that the approach presented here is not restricted to systems of ordinary differential equations .",
    "the algorithm which we have outlined in sec .  [ seclasers ] can be applied in the same way to compute the bifurcations of discrete time maps .",
    "moreover , it can be used in certain systems of partial differential equations to compute local bifurcations of homogenous solutions including turing bifurcations @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank wolfgang ebenhh who inspired this line of research by proposing a simple generalized food chain model .",
    "this work was supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( fe 359/6 ) .",
    "in this appendix we present the explicit comptation of the jacobian of the food web model .",
