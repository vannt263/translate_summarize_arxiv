    "magnetic fields are important constituents in the interstellar medium ( ism ) and are theoretically shown to control many physical processes including formation and fragmentation of molecular clouds ( e.g. , ) , and regulation of the process of star formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "observational studies , on the other hand , are essential to provide constraints on the existing numerical models . however , magnetic field observations require state - of - the art instruments and intricate observing and data reduction techniques .",
    "submillimeter polarimetry is one of the best tools for characterizing interstellar magnetic fields , because in most environments commonly observed aspherical dust grains are aligned with their principle axis of major inertia along the magnetic field lines .",
    "the physics of grain alignment is extremely rich and complex ; @xcite and ( with emphasis on cold clouds ) @xcite review the underlying theory . for decades dissipation of rotational energy in paramagnetic grains @xcite , set into suprathermal rotation by various torques @xcite , was considered the dominant process . towards the end of the 90s",
    "it became clear that anisotropic radiative torques do not only spin up the grains @xcite , but also align them efficiently with respect to the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this alignment mechanism works for larger grains with effective radii @xmath4 m , while smaller grains are at most weakly aligned @xcite .",
    "more recent work on radiative torques is reviewed by @xcite with further references therein .",
    "we also note that dust grains exposed to sub- or super - sonic gas flows are expected to be mechanically aligned with their long axis perpendicularly to the magnetic field @xcite . in summary , for molecular clouds the thermal emission of dust is linearly polarized orthogonally to the field lines , and a polarization map will reveal the direction of the plane - of - sky component of the magnetic field . for equipartition between magnetic pressure and turbulent and thermal presure ,",
    "its strength can be determined by means of the chandrasekhar - fermi method @xcite .",
    "this technique was originally applied to estimate the magnetic field strength in galactic spiral arms .",
    "chandrasekhar and fermi used the dispersion of polarization vectors with respect to the large - scale magnetic field , known , from the dichroic absorption of starlight @xcite , to be generally aligned with the galactic plane . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have developed the cf - method further , accounting for the distortion of the magnetic field by turbulence ; their analysis does not need to assume any model for the large - scale field .",
    "mhd simulations have shown ( @xcite ) that modified cf - methods are astonishingly robust , and that order - of - magnitude estimates are possible even in regions that are not dominated by hydromagnetic turbulence .",
    "this work deals exclusively with linear polarization . while in the nir",
    "a substantial fractional circular polarization can be expected for light scattered by aligned dust grains ( @xmath5% have been observed in the bn object in omc1 , @xcite ) or in the feature of water ice ( e.g. , @xcite for a summary of detections and further references ) , at sub - millimeter wavelengths we expect at most a weak signal .  in practice , the polarimetry of dust emission is completed by analyzing the circular and linear polarization of suitable spectral lines ( zeeman and goldreich - kylafis effects , for a review see e.g. , ) .",
    "sub - millimeter imaging polarimetry is not limited to dust polarization , but also useful to study the synchrotron emission from e.g. , plerion - type supernova remnants . while polarimetry reveals the magnetic field structure , observations into the far - infrared allow to determine the break in the spectral energy distribution and therefore the strength of the magnetic field @xcite , and to trace the production of dust by the progenitor star @xcite .",
    "as the theory and analytical methods evolved , technological progress has been made in submillimeter imaging and polarimetry . since low - mass protostars in nearby ( @xmath6  pc ) star forming regions and protoclusters in regions where massive stars form ( @xmath7  kpc )",
    "extend over scales corresponding to the limited field - of - view of ( sub)millimeter interferometers ( at most a few minutes of arc ) , remarkable results have been achieved thanks to their dual - polarization capabilities and powerful digital cross - correlators ( e.g. , @xcite ) . on larger scales ,",
    "inaccessible to interferometers , the imaging surveys done with the herschel space observatory ( e.g. , a survey of the gould belt in which low - mass stars form , , and the hobys survey for regions forming massive stars , ) , revealed filamentary structures across large areas on the sky .",
    "while the formation of these filaments out of the warm , neutral phase of the interstellar medium has motivated the aforementioned and other theoretical studies ( e.g. , ) , the large - scale magnetic field and therefore its dynamical role are still poorly constrained by observations . in the past decades , several wide - field bolometer cameras at various submillimeter observatories",
    "have therefore been equipped with polarimeters .",
    "table  [ tab : polarimeters ] summarizes their main features along with published first - light observations .",
    "submillimeter interferometers are not considered because they are blind to the large spatial scales addressed by this paper .",
    "likewise , spectro - polarimeters are omitted because they are designed for different , yet often complementary studies ( e.g. , correlation polarimeters such as xpol , @xcite ) .",

    "the modulator can be either a classical waveplate operating in transmission or a tunable , reflecting polarizer ( see table  [ tab : polarimeters ] ) .    in both methods the measurements of the stokes parameters received from a given position in the sky are not strictly simultaneous .",

    "the suppression of the 1/f noise in stokes i , measured simultaneously with stokes q and u , still requires fast scanning .",
    "we will come back to this topic in section  [ sec : reduction ] .",
    "this work describes polka , the polarimeter for the atacama pathfinder experiment ( apex , ) .",
    "polka , as a fast reflection - type polarization modulator , belongs to the second type of polarimeters .",
    "it is used with laboca , the large apex bolometer camera .",
    "laboca operates at and consists of 295 semiconductor bolometers , detecting the temperature rise due to the absorption of radiation .",
    "the bolometers are arranged in an hexagonal grid with two beam spacing , providing an instantaneous field - of - view of @xmath27 . for the polka observations , 230 pixels",
    "offer an acceptable noise level .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : section [ sec : hardware ] describes the hardware of the rotating half - waveplate , its working principle , the measurement equation and the characterization and calibration of the device .",
    "section [ sec : reduction ] provides a detailed description of the data reduction methods such as correlated - noise and bandpass filtering .",
    "we also introduce novel techniques to demodulate the signals by a generalized synchronous demodulation and to remove instrumental artifacts .",
    "these techniques are indispensable for imaging polarimetry and were specifically created for polka .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] presents the first observational results from polka with a reliable polarization angle calibration .",
    "we conclude the paper with section  [ sec : conclusions ] and refer the reader interested in the relevant mathematical methods to the appendix .",
    "polarization transforming reflectors were devised already more than two decades ago @xcite , but in ( sub-)millimeter astronomy they have been used only twice .",
    "several designations for devices of this kind exist in literature , for the purpose of this paper we refer to them as reflecting polarization modulator ( hereafter rpm ) .",
    "@xcite and describe , respectively , the systems installed at the nro 45 m ( for spectral line polarimetry ) and the smto 10 m ( with a 19-channel bolometer array operating at ) telescopes .",
    "modulators of this kind have the double advantage that their reflectivity is excellent ( closer to 100% than the transmission of classical waveplates ) and that they can be tuned within a wide wavelength range ( only limited by the design of the grids ) .",
    "rpms are simple yet efficient optical equivalents to birefringent materials ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] ) : in a parallel assembly of a grid and a mirror , mounted at an adjustable distance , the component of the incident radiation that is polarized parallel to the wires can excite an electromagnetic mode and is reflected off , while the component polarized perpendicular to the wires is transmitted and then reflected into the outgoing ray where it is superposed to the other ray , with a delay - induced phase difference . in a birefringent material , these two components correspond to the `` fast '' and the `` slow '' rays , respectively . if the device is tuned such that the phase difference between the two rays is @xmath28 , the overall effect is that of a classical half - waveplate , i.e. , transmitting both polarized and unpolarized radiation , but rotating the plane of polarization by the double position angle of the grid . when a linearly polarized incident signal is measured with a polarization - sensitive bolometer element ( or through an analyzer grid , for elements insensitive to polarization ) , a rotation of the waveplate therefore modulates the received power . the amplitude and the phase of the modulation ( which for a constant rotation speed is sinusoidal ) then yields the linear polarization and its polarization angle , respectively .",
    "the cassegrain focal plane of the apex telescope is reimaged to the bolometer array of laboca with three concave mirrors , two flat mirrors and a lens .",
    "the aperture ratio of the cassegrain focus , @xmath29 , is reduced to @xmath30 in the focus of laboca .",
    "we stress that the accomodation of a polarimeter was in the design specifications of the tertiary optics right from the beginning . in 2009 , when polka was permanently installed , it simply replaced one of the two flat mirrors and a filterwheel with two analyzer grids was added .",
    "the modulator of polka ( fig .",
    "[ fig : polka ] ) was designed and manufactured by the _ fraunhofer institute for applied optics and precision engineering _",
    "( fraunhofer iof , jena , germany ) .",
    "the grid for the modulator was made in the division for submillimeter technologies at mpifr , has an aperture of 246  mm and is made of @xmath31 m thick tungsten wires @xcite . for the analyzer , two identical grids were contributed by rwth university aachen ( germany ) , each of 146  mm aperture and made of gold - coated tungsten wires .",
    "the two analyzer grids are mounted at different position angles in order to suppress systematic effects , an equipment feature to which we will come back in section [ sec : ip ] . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : polka ] ( right panel ) , the analyzer grid is used only in transmission .",
    "the smooth rotation of the grid - mirror unit is ensured by an air bearing .",
    "it consists of a rotor ( pale orange in fig .",
    "[ fig : polka ] ) and a stator ( shown in orange ) .",
    "the compressed air enters through a channel machined into the stator and flows from the center of the bearing to the outside .",
    "the surface of the bearing is made of two hemispheres .",
    "this ensures that the bearing works in any orientation , which for a cassegrain cabin is evidently an indispensable feature .",
    "we operate the air bearing at a pressure of 4  bar , which is appropriate given the altitude of the observatory ( 5105  m ) .",
    "the position angles are read by an encoder ; in practice , a time stamp is written for each crossing of a well defined reference position .",
    "interpolations between two successive reference crossings then provide the position angles for each record in the bolometer data stream , sampled at a speed of 1  khz .",
    "the whole dataset ( bolometer total power counts , and the speed and position angle of the waveplate ) are then downsampled to a frequency in the range from 25 to 50  hz and written to raw data files ( in multi - beam fits format , ) , which are subsequently analyzed by the data processing software described in section  [ sec : reduction ] .",
    "the measurement equation accounts for the multiple reflections by defining a suitable coordinate frame for the description of linear polarizations and therefore stokes @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the rotations and inversions of the coordinate system in the path of the beam are then described by successive similarity transformations of the coherency matrix @xcite .",
    "this algebraic formulation of polarimetry owes its power to the capacity to represent both mixed polarization states ( like mller matrices ) and phase information ( like complex jones vectors ) . for details ,",
    "we refer to appendix [ app : coherency ] . here",
    "we present the result of the calculation , which is provided in full length in appendix  [ app : measurementequation ] .",
    "we define the coordinate system in the focal plane , located between the vertex of the telescope and its tertiary mirror , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : focalplane ] . in the following",
    ", we will refer to this frame as `` cassegrain coordinate system '' with stokes parameters @xmath32 defined such that the polarization angle @xmath33 is measured counter - clockwise from the positive x - axis ( ieee definition ) , as viewed from the tertiary to the secondary mirror .",
    "the resulting measurement equation reads @xmath34      -\\frac{u_{\\rm c}}{2}\\sin{(4\\varphi-2\\delta\\theta)}(1-\\cos{\\phi } ) \\ } \\label{eq : measurement}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] with the stokes parameters @xmath24 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the signs of the terms for stokes @xmath37 and @xmath26 are opposite to the sign of the stokes @xmath25 term because polka is a reflecting polarimeter .",
    "@xmath38 is the position angle of the grid but projected onto a plane normal to the incoming ray , measured counter - clockwise from the plane of incidence .",
    "it is related to the position angle @xmath39 of the wires of the grid ( as read out by the encoder ) by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the angle of incidence defined in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] .",
    "because of the relatively small angle of incidence in our setup ( @xmath42 ) , the difference between @xmath38 and @xmath39 is at most @xmath43 , so that the sampling of position angles is not too distorted and remains reasonably regular .",
    "@xmath44 is the phase difference created by the delay between the reflected and transmitted ( thus , orthogonal ) polarization .",
    "the angle @xmath45 accounts for the rotation of the @xmath46 plane in fig .",
    "[ fig : focalplane ] that occurs when the beam is downfolded , and for the orientation of the analyzer grid .",
    "more precisely , the rotation angle @xmath45 is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the rotation of the beam occurring between the rpm and the analyzer grid ( measured with respect to its wires ) .",
    "@xmath49 describes the beam rotation between the cassegrain focal plane and polka , measured counter - clockwise with respect to the x - axis in the focal plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig : focalplane ] ) .",
    "we deliberately show the measurement equation ( [ eq : measurement ] ) in full generality because it allows to estimate the precision needed to tune the rpm , and to evaluate the bandwidth smearing that will be addressed below .",
    "we also keep stokes @xmath37 in equation  ( [ eq : measurement ] ) , although in view of the aforesaid it can be expected to be small in most applications .",
    "incidentally , it may still be produced by the spurious conversion of stokes @xmath24 into stokes @xmath37 arising when a grid is mounted in a divergent beam with its wires parallel to the plane of incidence ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "obviously , this occurs in every other modulation cycle .",
    "however , even if this instrumental conversion was a first - order effect , its impact on the measured modulation would be of second order , owing to the half - waveplate tuning and to the relatively small phase error introduced by an imperfect tuning and/or the bandwidth effect discussed below .",
    "we finally note here that a fast polarization modulation may also be generated by periodically varying the delay - induced phase difference @xmath44 .",
    "as shown by @xcite and @xcite , a sinusoidal modulation can then be achieved by adding a second polarization transforming reflector , rotated by @xmath50 with respect to the first one ( cf .",
    "table  [ tab : polarimeters ] ) .",
    "in such a design , known as a dual _ variable - delay polarization modulator _ ( dual vpm ) , the system can be kept free from unwanted oscillations by using piezo - electric actuators ( the _ translational polarization rotator _ introduced by @xcite is a further development ) .",
    "it seems fair to say that in both approaches the stability requirement makes the system more complex , either by adding a second vpm , or , as in our case , an air - bearing .",
    "a way to enable an even faster modulation without moving parts is the faraday rotation modulator @xcite using a ferrite dielectric waveguide .",
    "this kind of magneto - optical devices has a promising performance in the polarimetry of the cosmic microwave background and of diffuse , large - scale galactic dust emission at frequencies up to 150  ghz @xcite .",
    "however , to implement this technology for large detector arrays at higher frequencies is very challenging .",
    "we now rewrite the measurement equation ( [ eq : measurement ] ) for a vanishing stokes @xmath37 , but introduce efficiency factors @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 describing the optical transmission , and the bandpass- and time - smearing , respectively : @xmath54\\ } \\tts\\tts \\label{eq : measurement2}\\ ] ] the efficiency factors will be quantified in the next section .",
    "a rotation of the analyzer grid by @xmath23 obviously inverts the signs of @xmath35 and @xmath36 . by adding the signals from measurements with orthogonal analyzer orientations it is in principle possible to separate stokes @xmath24 from stokes @xmath25 and @xmath26",
    "this requires a _ strict _ synchronization between the slew motion of the telescope and the waveplate rotation when observing in on - the - fly mode . in practice such",
    "a synchronization is difficult to achieve and its failure leads to a substantial loss of usable data .",
    "at best , such an approach may work for fast on - off observations of compact sources , an application not considered in this paper .",
    "for the extended sources we focus on here , scanning the sky in the on - the - fly mode and thereby obtaining a nyquist - critical sampling , is the observing method of choice for which a fault - tolerant system ( yet accurately tracing actual values ) proves to be more efficient .",
    "we will show in section  [ sec : reduction ] that the stokes parameters can be separated by a dedicated time series analysis .",
    "notwithstanding , using two analyzer grids at different orientations may suppress a part of the instrumental polarization , which we will characterize below .    in order to obtain , for a given point of the mapped area , a stationary stokes @xmath25 and @xmath26 , we transform @xmath55 to the equatorial reference frame . from the transformation of the left - handed cassegrain coordinates @xmath46 to offsets @xmath56 in the right - handed system of the tangential plane , @xmath57 with @xmath58 the parallactic angle",
    ", we can readily derive the corresponding transformation of stokes @xmath55 to @xmath59 , leading in equations ( [ eq : measurement ] ) and ( [ eq : measurement2 ] ) to the substitution @xmath60 . in the iau definition , which differs from the ieee definition",
    ", the polarization angle is measured counter - clockwise from north and is now given by @xmath61\\,.\\ ] ] it should be kept in mind that @xmath35 and @xmath36 consist of an intrinsic signal and a polarization of instrumental origin , arising mainly in the tertiary optics .",
    "the fractional linear polarization @xmath62 used throughout the rest of this paper is given by @xmath63 stokes @xmath64 and @xmath65 are fraught with systematic and random errors .",
    "the former will be removed in the correction for instrumental polarization ( see section [ sec : ip ] ) , but random errors still lead to a bias and therefore an overestimate of @xmath66 ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , it can be shown , both with a monte - carlo simulation and analytically , that if the most likely values of @xmath64 and @xmath65 are used ( in general median values ) , no such corrections need to be done ( for details see section  [ sec : reduction ] ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath62 and @xmath67 are calculated only at the last data reduction stage .",
    "the modulation efficiency can be decomposed into the three factors @xmath68 and @xmath51 . from equation  ( [ eq : measurement2 ] )",
    "one can see that only the third factor affects all stokes parameters , while the other two factors only affect stokes parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 .    the first factor , @xmath52 accounts for the fact that an optimal tuning can only be achieved at a nominal frequency , while the bandpass of laboca , defined by a set of cold filters at the liquid nitrogen and helium-4 stages , extends over 60  ghz ( fig .  5 in ) .",
    "even if the grid and mirrors had a 100% efficiency , the modulation would suffer from a loss because the optimal half - wave phase shift ( @xmath69 ) can only be achieved at a fixed frequency .",
    "three micrometer screws allow to fine - tune the distance between the mirror and the grid , @xmath70 . at the passband - weighted center frequency of 344  ghz ( @xmath71 m ) and for our angle of incidence , @xmath72 ,",
    "@xmath73 the tuning distance is @xmath74 m to account for the finite thickness of the tungsten wires .",
    "the zero position of the micrometer screws has been confirmed by the disappearance of the moir pattern arising for a finite mirror - grid distance . at a wavelength",
    "offset @xmath75 from @xmath76 , the phase is shifted from its optimum value @xmath69 to @xmath77 equation  ( [ eq : measurement ] ) is then used to calculate the modulation across the spectral bandpass .",
    "the latter may be modified by the atmospheric transmission , but for acceptable observing conditions , the loss of modulation efficiency does not strongly depend on the weather . for a water vapor column of 0.7  mm , @xmath78 elevation , and 553  hpa ambient pressure",
    "the resulting modulation efficiency is @xmath79% . because @xmath80  rad , the bandpass smearing is a second order effect which explains why it affects the polarization efficiency only weakly .    the second factor , @xmath53 , results from the time smearing , i.e. , the dilution of the modulation due to the elementary integration time step @xmath81 , given by the sinc function @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the angular speed of the waveplate rotation . in practice , we use @xmath84  hz and for integration intervals of @xmath85 or 40  msec the dilution factors are 97 and 90% , respectively . the third factor , @xmath51 , can be calculated numerically from the optical properties of the polarizer ( i.e. , the grid labeled @xmath86 in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] ) , namely its reflectance , @xmath87 and transmission , @xmath88 for the radiation power polarized parallel , respectively perpendicular , to the wire grids ( @xcite , further references therein ) . in the limiting case",
    "where @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 ( where @xmath92 is the spacing between successive wires and @xmath93 their diameter ) one can calculate @xmath87 and @xmath88 from @xcite @xmath94 for polka , @xmath95 m ( the error has been determined from measurements under a microscope ) and @xmath96 m . therefore , the filling factor @xmath97 does not obey the last of the three conditions above .",
    "@xcite used a green function method to semi - analytically derive the transmission of wire grids . using their results @xcite for our filling factor of @xmath98 and the spacing of @xmath99  @xmath11 m",
    ", we find @xmath100 for normal incidence , for our case of a slightly oblique incidence the resulting @xmath101 would decrease even more .",
    "we note ( 1 ) that the application of the approximative eq .",
    "[ eq : transmission ] yields a value for @xmath101 well within the errors due to the measured variance of @xmath92 , and ( 2 ) that the impact of the latter is small due to the low ratio of @xmath102 ( cf .",
    "13 of @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite showed with terahertz time domain spectroscopy that the theoretical predictions from green s function describe the actual measurements of tungsten wire grids similar to ours fairly well .",
    "this discussion also strongly suggests that the polarization efficiency @xmath103 in eq .",
    "[ eq : measurement2 ] is dominated by the time smearing factor @xmath53 .",
    "we are therefore confident that @xmath51 is close to 0.99 ( the waveplate mirror is of optical quality and therefore leads to no loss of efficiency ) .",
    "its measurement by means of primary calibrators is notoriously difficult .",
    "when polka started its operation in december 2011 the flatfielding was done on mars without the modulator and analyzer grids .",
    "folding the fluxes predicted by the model of @xcite ( and calculated with the online tool provided by @xcite ) into the bandpass of laboca yields a calibration factor of 4.74  jy/@xmath11v . the model by @xcite yields marginally ( @xmath104% at 300  ghz ) higher continuum fluxes .",
    "after insertion of the modulator grid calibration maps on mars , taken without the analyzer grid , showed no significant flux loss : during the two - week campaign , we measured daily the flux rise of mars ( the planet approached its march 2012 opposition ) .",
    "the uncertainty of the relative flux scale is typically 2% . comparing the model with the measured fluxes yields a flux calibration factor of 4.63  jy/@xmath11v .",
    "the accuracy is limited by the uncertainty of the model flux , estimated to @xmath105% . ",
    "19 uranus maps , made to characterize the instrumental polarization ( see section [ sec : ip ] ) , yield a calibration factor of 4.75  jy/@xmath11v , using the uranus model esa-4 ( @xcite , estimated to be accurate to @xmath106% ) and assuming that the analyzer grid has a transmission of 100% in one polarization and no cross polarization .",
    "the calibration factors agree within 5% with respect to the mean value , 4.7  jy/@xmath11v .",
    "we stress that the observations of uranus , unlike those of mars , were done in polarimetry mode , which involves a more intricate data reduction ( section [ sec : reduction ] ) , while the flux scale is preserved . the good agreement between the calibrations done without grids , with the modulator grid , and then with the analyzer grids sets a lower limit of 95% to the transmission @xmath107 of polka .",
    "our calibration factor falls 27% below the value determined by .",
    "one reason for this discrepancy is the determination of the opacity correction .",
    "we obtain it from the precipitable water vapor ( @xmath108 ) measured once per minute with the apex 183  ghz radiometer and converted to a bandpass - weighted zenith opacity .",
    "a consistent and reproducible calibration is also important in view of the processing of polarization data obtained under varying weather conditions ( see section [ sec : reduction ] ) .",
    "we use the _ am _ transmission model , predicting a zenith opacity of @xmath109 , where the coefficients @xmath110 and @xmath111 parameterize the `` wet '' and `` dry '' atmosphere and depend on frequency and outside pressure .",
    "an accurate comparison of our calibration with that of other polarimeters is difficult .",
    "different bolometer arrays have different spectral bandpasses , therefore flux measurements in sources with strong spectral indices and substantial contributions from spectral lines vary from instrument to instrument , e.g. for omc1 ( section [ subsec : omc1 ] ) where spectral lines in the scuba bandpass contribute up to 50% to the observed flux @xcite . for tau",
    "a ( the crab nebula , section [ subsec : crab ] ) , whose flux is dominated by synchrotron emission with a relatively flat spectral index ( @xmath112 ) , our peak flux , applying the calibration factors derived from mars and uranus , differs , after correcting for the slightly different beam sizes , by only 3.6% from that of @xcite , measured with scuba at .      as stated in section  [ sec : intro ] , the most important quantity for the analysis of magnetic fields by means of polarimetry of dust or synchrotron emission is the polarization angle .",
    "its accuracy depends on the instrumental conversion between stokes @xmath24 on the one hand and stokes @xmath25 and @xmath26 on the other hand , and between stokes @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the first conversion can be corrected by means of an unpolarized calibrator ( we used uranus , see section [ sec : ip ] ) , while the second one arises in the tertiary optics and can be measured with an additional polarizer . in march 2013",
    "we performed a series of calibrations with a high - quality grid mounted in the focal plane of the telescope ( fig .",

    "the main contributions to ip arise from the tertiary optics in the receiver cabin ( see also @xcite and further references therein ) , and ignoring them may lead to a severe misinterpretation of polarization data . in order to quantify and correct the ip , one ideally observes an unpolarized , unresolved source , e.g. , a gas planet like uranus . in principle , mars and mercury may also be useful .",

    "we expect sign changes of the instrumental stokes",

    "these numbers demonstrate that the instrumental stokes @xmath25 and @xmath26 beams are wider than the stokes @xmath24 beam , leading to a larger ip at off - source positions . they also show that using an analyzer grid at different orientations can help to decrease the ip level .",
    "a further reduction occurs because the ip pattern , whose polarization vectors are fixed in the cassegrain coordinate system , is smeared out on the sky thanks to the parallactic rotation .",
    "however , the above numbers substantiate that the removal of ip with a dedicated correction algorithm is essential . in appendix",
    "[ app : ipcorr ] we present such a procedure that accounts for the detailed coupling of instrumental stokes @xmath25 and @xmath26 beam patterns to the brightness distribution on the sky .",

    "what extent this residual ip affects the accuracy of the measured polarization is difficult to say without deeper observations , each at several parallactic angles .",
    "it seems fair to say that only sensitive observations of weak polarizations ( @xmath129  mjy ) are concerned when a strong source ( stokes  @xmath130  jy ) is located in the error beam .",
    "thanks to the large field of view of laboca , polka is a polarimeter of choice for imaging the magnetic field structure of extended objects .",
    "so far fields as large as @xmath131 have been observed ; larger areas require mosaics .",
    "the observing methods are the same as for non - polarimetric maps , i.e. , a nyquist - critical sampling is achieved by slew motions along spiral or linear patterns . in this mode ,",
    "the noise - equivalent flux density per pixel is 55  mjy@xmath132 ( sensitivity weighted mean value of all usable pixels after skynoise filtering , ) .",
    "however , owing to the modulation of the signal , the data reduction methods are more involved .",
    "polka is usually operated at a spinning frequency of @xmath84  hz , or a modulation frequency of @xmath133  hz , so as to obtain four data records of 40  msec per modulation cycle .",
    "this frequency also allows to separate the modulation of the polarized flux from atmospheric fluctuations which remain below @xmath134  hz , as demonstrated by the spectral power density ( i.e. , the fourier transform of the autocorrelation function of the time series ) shown in fig .",

    "a typical time series of polka data is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : datareduction ] and demonstrates the data reduction steps that will be discussed in the following .",
    "the signal can be decomposed into three contributions , namely into ( 1 ) a periodic , deterministic signal of instrumental origin , ( 2 ) a piecewise periodic , deterministic signal ( the polarization received from the observed source ) , and ( 3 ) a non - deterministic signal ( the 1/f noise from the atmosphere , the detector noise and the high - frequency noise from the readout electronics ) .      before we present the further data reduction methods , a few words about speed considerations seem appropriate here .",
    "the lowest frequencies of the atmospheric fluctuations in fig .",
    "[ fig : freqspectrum ] can be suppressed by choosing an adequate mapping speed . in the logarithmic spiral mode",
    ", a single subscan takes 36  s. atmospheric fluctuations on longer timescales are therefore avoided . to what extent faster fluctuations",
    "degrade the image quality depends both on the source structure and on how it is sampled in the on - the - fly observing mode , scanning the source with a linear or spiral stroke pattern .",
    "the latter is used with a constant angular speed of @xmath135 , i.e. , a filamentary source , repeatedly appearing in the time series of a scan , has fourier components at a frequency of 0.25  hz and its harmonics .",
    "the removal of atmospheric fluctations is therefore mandatory and will be discussed in section  [ sec : filter ] .",
    "on the other hand , for a speed of @xmath136 ( the largest speed occurring in the spiral stroke pattern ) , the main lobe of the diffraction pattern of a point - like source has a width of 8.8  hz ( fwhm ) in frequency domain , which implies that the largest power is at frequencies above those of the fluctuations .",
    "these considerations hold for stokes  @xmath24 . assuming a constant fractional polarization across the source",
    ", its modulation appears in frequency domain as a scaled version of the stokes  @xmath24 spectrum but now centered at the modulation frequency @xmath137 , i.e. , well above the atmospheric fluctuations , which explains why they affect the polarization far less than stokes  @xmath24 .",
    "the consequences for the demodulation will be treated in section  [ sec : demodulation ] .      a closer inspection of the time series shows a spurious signal on top of the expected output ( fig .",
    "[ fig : datareduction]a ) . the spectral energy distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : freqspectrum ] ) confirms that it is a harmonic total power beating , starting at the fundamental frequency @xmath138 of the mechanical modulator rotation and visible in all the harmonics up to the nyquist frequency .",
    "the spurious signal is not due to a gain variation and therefore independent from the total power received from the sky .",
    "its origin can be manifold .",
    "it is common wisdom that a modulator housed in the cold part of the optics provides intrinsically more stable signals , but instability is not an issue here ( the beating is a deterministic signal ) .",
    "the resonances that can occur in reflecting polarizers @xcite are also unlikely to be of concern here ( the characteristics of the grid as described in section  [ sec : transmission ] are optimal ) .",
    "imaging the beating across the full array and as a function of time , i.e. , record by record , reveals a bar - like , asymmetric total power distribution , rotating about the center of the array with the frequency @xmath138 .",
    "the strength of this rotating feature is modulated with the frequency @xmath139 of the second harmonic . in the time series of the total power beating the combination of these spatial and temporal variations leads , for a given bolometer channel , to the observed profile .",
    "we also note here that the sampling frequency of 25  hz is not an exact multiple of @xmath138 and that the spikes of the beating are not fully resolved in time ; in the fourier spectrum this leads to a further redistribution of spectral power among the harmonics .",
    "this discussion may suggest that the beating is due to the differential emissivity of the grid and the mirror of the modulator , so that the higher emissivity of the mirror leads to a net polarization perpendicular to the wires of the modulator grid .",
    "however , we can not corroborate such a conclusion .",
    "the mirror is made from an aluminium alloy whose conductivity falls short of that of pure aluminium but can be exptected to be of the order of @xmath140  s / m , while that of tungsten is @xmath141  s / m . from the hagen - rubens law for the spectral emissivity , @xmath142 , and kirchhoff s law we can then determine the expected emission .",
    "assuming for the modulator a typical temperature of 283  k , we obtain a polarized signal with a rayleigh - jeans temperature of @xmath143  mk , accounting for the filling factor of the grid .",
    "the strength of the total power beating is comparable to that of our orion  kl data , i.e. , a @xmath144  jy source observed with an atmospheric transmission of 55 to 72% . with an aperture efficiency of 0.6 , this converts to an antenna temperature of 1.4 to 1.8  k which is an order of magnitude above our estimate of the beating expected from a differential emissivity of mirror and grid .",
    "more dedicated measurements will be needed to clarify the origin of the beating and to further improve the system .    in practice",
    ", the total power beating dominates the signal but is strictly harmonic . in the raw data from a single scan and pixel ,",
    "the modulation of the signal due to its polarization is still negligible ; with the aforementioned noise - equivalent flux density , the noise in a 40  msec dump amounts to 275  mjy . in the fourier transform of the time series",
    "the beating can be easily distinguished from the spectrum of white noise ( which has a constant amplitude but a random phase ) and is removed from the time series pixel - wise and scan by scan ( fig .",
    "[ fig : datareduction]b ) , by eliminating the narrow spikes in the fourier spectrum of the adequately apodized time series , and interpolating between the real and imaginary parts next to them . in practice",
    ", this correction leads to an insignificant distortion of the observed polarization , because the latter is only piecewise periodic .",
    "its spectral power is distributed across a much wider frequency range determined by the window function ( unity when a pixel crosses the source , and zero elsewhere ) , especially if a filamentary structure is observed perpendicular to its long axis .",
    "another reason for the widened fourier spectrum of the modulation centered at @xmath145 is that the polarization vectors on the sky , while the source is scanned , either rotate with , or counter - rotate against , the motion of the waveplate .",
    "tests with simulated sources have shown that the removal of the beating does not significantly affect the measurement of the intrinsic linear polarization .",
    "one of these test sources , a @xmath146 wide model consisting of three gaussians , whose power is as weak as 0.5% of that of the simulated beating ( 100  jy ) , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .",
    "after removal of the beating and of the simulated atmospheric total power fluctuations , the intrinsic polarization of @xmath147% ( modeled as the projection of a dipole field onto the plane of the sky ) could be restored . towards zones with a strong curvature of the field lines",
    "the @xmath148 wide beam ( fwhm ) leads to depolarization , while an excess of the fractional polarization is observed where the stokes @xmath24 emission is weak ; this is due to the difficulties to conserve the largest spatial scales in the reconstruction of the data . in summary",
    ", the removal of the total power beating by the software filter described in this section shows that mounting a polarimeter in the warm part of the optics , making it more prone to resonances of this kind , can be compensated for by an adequate data reduction algorithm .",
    "the overlap of the near - field beam patterns of the individual pixels leads to a strong correlation between the signals received by a pair of pixels , because they `` see '' the same atmospheric fluctuations ( `` 1/f noise '' ) . for each data record",
    "the median signal across the array provides a good measure for the dominating contribution of the atmosphere to the received total power .",
    "however , the gains of the individual bolometer pixels , as determined from observations of mars , uranus or neptune , are not appropriate because , unlike these primary calibrators , the atmospheric emission fills the entire forward - beam power pattern of each pixel .",
    "the strong correlation among the signals allows us to re - calculate and to apply the gains for the reception of the atmospheric total power .",
    "then for each record the median signal across the array is calculated and removed from the time series , and the resulting signal is scaled to the correct far - field gain for each pixel .    while the 1/f noise is efficiently suppressed by means of this correlated - noise filter , the power at the highest frequencies ( @xmath149  hz ) originates from the readout electronics and is suppressed by means of a wavelet filter .",
    "we refer the reader interested in wavelet filtering to appendix [ app : wavelet ] .",
    "both the correlated - noise and wavelet filtere may not be used for the modulated ( i.e. , polarized ) part of the signal . depending on the polarization structure of the observed source",
    ", the modulation leads to a partial correlation of the signals and would be distorted by the removal of correlated noise .",
    "fortunately , such a step is not necessary here : as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : freqspectrum ] , the atmospheric fluctuations hardly leak into the modulation of the polarized fraction of the total power .",
    "we note , however , that although it is not modulated stokes @xmath24 contaminates the polarization , due to the scanning motion .",
    "this happens , e.g. , for a point source scanned at maximum speed , leading to an 8.8  hz wide ( fwhm ) fourier spectrum ( the most extreme case demonstrated in section  [ sec : speed ] ) .",
    "the correction for this contribution in the demodulation of the polarization will be described in section  [ sec : demodulation ] . for the modulated , i.e. , polarized fraction of the signal a frequency filter of the form @xmath150",
    "is applied to the fourier transform of suitably apodized segments of data ( typically individual scans ) , with @xmath151  hz and @xmath152  hz .      depending on the polarization structure of the source , the phase and amplitude of the modulation changes rapidly when the telescope sweeps across the sky .",
    "therefore , the demodulation of the data and the map - making must be performed by the same data reduction step , to retrieve stokes @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the map - making , i.e. , the gridding of stokes @xmath24 to a regular grid , follows the usual procedure to construct a regularly sampled image from a critically , but irregularly sampled stream of data : for each pixel of the output image , only data within a cutoff radius around this pixel will be considered , and the flux assigned to this pixel is an average of this data , weighted with a convolution kernel ( here a gaussian is used ) . for stokes",
    "@xmath64 and @xmath65 , the approach is different due to the modulation : first , the set of data located within the cutoff radius is binned into discrete waveplate position angle intervals , then this binned data is demodulated . in the logarithmic spiral mode , laboca scans the sky at a varying speed ( at constant angular velocity ) .",
    "therefore the sampling of waveplate angles is no longer strictly synchronized with the spatial sampling of the area to be mapped , and the demodulation scheme needs to be generalized .",
    "we will show now that this generalization is straightforward .",
    "the measurement process can be represented via equation  ( [ eq : measurement ] ) as a time series , whose elements correspond to discrete time steps and therefore different waveplate angles and celestial positions .",
    "we write this time series as a vector @xmath153 . since the polarization angle changes when the telescope sweeps the source , for the demodulation process we have to consider a subset of the data , @xmath154 , whose distance from a given pixel of the output map is within the cutoff radius of the convolution kernel used in the map - making .",
    "as already mentioned , @xmath155 may still contain a residual of the unmodulated signal , i.e. , stokes @xmath24 .",
    "this residual is removed from @xmath155 by a baseline subtraction , and we are left with the modulated , i.e. , polarized , signal fraction only , @xmath156 . the aim of generalized synchronous demodulation is to construct weight vectors @xmath157 , @xmath158 , such that stokes @xmath25 and @xmath26 are obtained through the scalar products @xmath159 in the following we assume that polka is at its nominal @xmath160 tuning , and denote the corresponding sine and cosine time series as vectors with elements @xmath161 where @xmath162 .",
    "the sensitivity of stokes @xmath25 and @xmath26 can then be derived from the radiometric noise @xmath163 in the time series @xmath153 with @xmath164 because the sampling is in general irregular , we can not expect that @xmath165 ( which was the prerequisite for the demodulation scheme in ) .",
    "however , generalized synchronous demodulation offers many possibilities for the construction of the weight vectors @xmath157 , @xmath158 , also for other than sinusoidal modulations . in our case",
    "an obvious choice consists of using @xmath166 and @xmath167 as basis functions , @xmath168 and to determine the coefficients @xmath11 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 such that equations  ( [ eq : demodulation ] ) are fulfilled .",
    "this yields @xmath172 thanks to the cauchy - schwarz inequality the denominator of these coefficients is positive , and zero only in the case that @xmath173 and @xmath174 are linearly dependent , i.e. , for @xmath175 or @xmath176 for all @xmath177 .",
    "the separation of stokes @xmath25 from stokes @xmath26 in a technique applying a sinusoidal modulation is then impossible , but this situation is unlikely to occur , not least due to the parallactic rotation .",
    "the lunar continuum radiation from radio to far infrared wavelengths is dominated by the thermal emission from the regolith covering the surface , originating from a frequency dependent depth of 10  m at 3  ghz ( the typical thickness of the regolith layer , @xcite ) to a few centimeters at 37  ghz @xcite .",
    "the fresnel coefficients for the last refraction between the regolith and the vacuum are different for polarizations perpendicular and parallel to the plane of incidence .",

    "to date it is impossible to say whether this difference is intrinsic or due to a bias introduced by the measurements and their analysis .",

    "we find a fractional polarization that is significantly higher , by a factor of 3 to 4 , compared to the bn / kl and south peaks .",
    "it traces a magnetic field of which the sky - plane projection is actually along the bar , in disagreement with the suggestion by @xcite .",
    "it is uncertain whether this result confirms the conjecture of @xcite that the dust temperature is lower in the bar than in bn / kl . from their co excitation modeling ,",
    "infer gas temperatures in excess of 350  k and 250  k towards bn / kl and the bar , respectively , corroborating the h@xmath212 excitation study of @xcite .",
    "an in - depth discussion of these findings is beyond the scope of the work at hand and will be followed up in a forthcoming study .",
    "in this work we demonstrated that polka , a reflection - type polarimeter installed in the warm optics of the bolometer camera laboca , can provide reliable measurements of the polarization of cosmic dust and synchrotron emission at submillimeter wavelengths , across fields as large as @xmath010@xmath213 .",
    "similar to a classical waveplate polarimeter , the polarized fraction of the received power is detected by virtue of its modulation when the plane of polarization is continuously rotated by the waveplate .",
    "standing waves in such a design are difficult to suppress , especially if space limitations in the receiver cabin are an issue .",
    "however , we could show that a total power beating adding a deterministic , strictly harmonic signal to the modulation can be efficiently filtered out , preserving both the amplitude and phase of the modulation , and therefore the information about the intrinsic polarization .",
    "a prerequesite for this filter to work is to observe the source in the on - the - fly mode .",
    "this observing mode , with either a linear or spiral stroke pattern , is the preferred method to obtain a critically sampled map with the bolometer array whose pixels are separated by two full half - power widths . in order to demodulate the signals and to obtain maps of the stokes parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 we introduced a dedicated algorithm , generalized synchronous demodulation .",
    "moreover , a strategy to remove the spurious instrumental conversion of stokes @xmath24 into stokes @xmath25 and @xmath26 has been proposed and successfully applied to the observations .    our results obtained for tau  a and omc1 agree reasonably well with previously published data , while we uncover the polarization structure of the dust emission in the orion bar , a prototypical photon - dominated region .",
    "this finding suggests that the projection of the magnetic field onto the plane of the sky is oriented along the bar .",
    "the physical implications of such a pseudo-2d configuration will be discussed in a forthcoming publication . towards the bn / kl region the polarization angles at and are comparable and rule out a wavelength - dependent rotation of the linear polarization .",
    "the polarization structure of the synchroton emission from the supernova remnant tau  a confirms that its synchrotron nebula is magnetically controlled .",
    "meanwhile polka has been used to observe the polarization of molecular clouds and the star - forming regions they harbor , down to flux densities of a few 100  mjy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these data demonstrate that the high sensitivity of laboca allows for a @xmath214 detection of a fractional linear polarization of 10% in a @xmath131 wide field after 2 hours on source , under decent ( 0.7  mm of water vapor ) yet frequent weather conditions .",

    "the description of ensembles in quantum theory lends itself to the introduction of the stokes parameters as coefficients appearing in the expansion of the coherency matrix by the identity matrix and the three pauli spin matrices @xcite : in quantum - electrodynamics there are two probabilities to consider , namely , the probability for a photon to be in a given polarization state , and the probability for this polarization state to be represented in an ensemble of photons .",

    "the basic idea of the correction procedure is that the response functions @xmath241 and @xmath242 can be measured on a spatially unresolved , unpolarized calibrator , e.g. , uranus , mars or mercury ( the latter two are intrinsically weakly linearly polarized but the radial orientation of polarization vectors leads to a mutual cancellation within the telescope s main beam ; mercury should be observed at full phase ) .",

    "we note that while the correction is done at a reduced spatial resolution , it is possible to recover the original resolution by dividing by @xmath256 up to a reasonable cutoff of spatial frequencies , and transforming the resulting @xmath251 back to the sky plane .",
    "this means that we can only correct for the effects of instrumental polarization down to spatial scales which are a factor @xmath257 larger than the original resolution .",

    "[ fig : model ] and also with xpol data from the 30 m telescope . as expected ,",
    "the correction is largest at the edges of sources with a nearby strong emission peak , because the stokes beams @xmath259 ( @xmath260 ) are usually wider than the antenna power beam pattern @xmath243 , resulting in an increase of the fractional instrumental polarization .",
    "this is often a direct consequence of the fact that the design of telescopes and their tertiary optics is optimized for stokes @xmath24 but not for the other stokes parameters .",
    "the properties of the discrete wavelet transformation ( hereafter dwt , see e.g. , @xcite ) has properties that are similar to those of the fast fourier transform , e.g. , the basis functions of both linear transformations are localized in frequency space .",
    "the basis functions of the dwt , however , are also localized in the time domain .",
    "here we use the dwt to filter out the high - frequency noise in the time series of signals measured by a bolometer pixel , applying daubechies wavelet functions with up to 12 coefficients @xcite .",
    "we perform the dwt , identify the contribution of the high - frequency noise ( contained in the high wavelet numbers ) , set it to zero , and transform back to the time domain .",
