    "cooperative phenomena in coupled dynamical systems are of significant interest in the field of physical science , biological science , and engineering applications @xcite .",
    "the prominent cooperative behaviors that occur in periodic and chaotic oscillating systems are synchronization @xcite , amplitude death@xcite , phase - flip transition@xcite , etc .",
    "_ amplitude death _ ( ad ) is one of the fascinating and important emergent phenomena in which quenching of amplitude or cessation of oscillation to the steady state occurs in coupled dynamical systems under some proper parametric conditions .",
    "studies on ad has been attracting the attention of the researchers for more than two decades owing to its importance in the field of physical science , biology , oceanography , etc@xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of ad has first been reported by @xcite ; later the same has been studied in detail by @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "recently , an extensive review on ad has been reported in ref . that discussed several aspects of ad , and a thorough literature review .",
    "to induce ad in coupled oscillators , several coupling schemes have been proposed ( see ref . and references therein ) ; a few of them are linear diffusive coupling@xcite , dynamic coupling @xcite , environmental coupling @xcite , etc . in most of the coupling schemes , to induce ad , it is necessary that the systems are mismatched . in a seminal paper by @xcite , for the first time , it has been shown that a _",
    "coupling time - delay _ can induce ad even in identical limit cycle oscillators ( i.e. , oscillators without parameter mismatch ) .",
    "this paper leads to a whole lot of research activity in inducing ad , e.g. , in electronic circuit@xcite , in an assembly of delay coupled oscillator@xcite , distributed delay oupled oscillator @xcite , ring of delay coupled limit cycle oscillator@xcite , delay coupled chaotic oscillator@xcite , and delay coupled nonidentical oscillators@xcite , to name a few .",
    "later , the constraints of having either parameter missmatch or coupling time - delay to induce ad have been removed with dynamic coupling , conjugate coupling @xcite , and linear augmentation @xcite coupling , where ad occurs in identical systems with instantaneous coupling .",
    "recently , another interesting process of inducing ad in _ identical _ systems has been reported by @xcite that considers _ mean - field _ ( mf ) diffusive coupling .",
    "earlier , ad through mf coupling has been reported in ref . and ref .",
    "with coupling time - delay , and distributed frequencies or parameter mismatches , respectively",
    ".    another important topic of study in the context of ad is the _ transition scenarios leading to ad_. in delay coupled periodic and chaotic oscillators ( without intrinsic time - delay ) , several transition scenarios have been reported ; the most prominent are , ( a ) phase - flip transition@xcite , and ( b ) transitions from chaotic to ad state via quasiperiodic and periodic states@xcite , @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "that phase - flip transition , i.e. , the abrupt change from in - phase synchronized dynamics to antiphase synchronized dynamics , is caused by the time - delay in the _ coupling path _ ; the same is true for the latter transition , also . in the non - delayed coupling case , _ coupling strength _ is the defining parameter ; depending upon coupling strength , transition from unsynchronized states to ad via in - phase ( anti - phase ) synchronized states has been reported in ref .",
    "( environmental coupling ) and ref .",
    "( mean - field couling ) .",
    "but , the effect of _ intrinsic time - delay _ on the transition scenario is yet to be explored .",
    "surprisingly , in all the above mentioned works on ad , the coupled dynamical systems are considered to be periodic or chaotic oscillators with no _ intrinsic time - delay _ ; in these studies , when present , time - delay appears only in the coupling path .",
    "the systems with intrinsic time - delay are infinite dimensional and very complex@xcite .",
    "recent ongoing interest in intrinsic time - delay systems originates from the fact that in real world often we have to encounter with the systems having _ intrinsic time - delay _ ; examples include , blood production in patients with leukemia ( mackey - glass model ) @xcite , dynamics of optical systems ( e.g. ikeda system ) @xcite , population dynamics @xcite , el nio / southern oscillation ( enso ) @xcite , etc .",
    "due to infinite - dimensionality of the time - delay systems , studies on their collective behaviors like synchronization and ad are much more involved , and need special attention @xcite . in this context ,",
    "synchronization of chaos and hyperchaos in intrinsic time - delay systems is a well explored topic and extensive research has already been devoted@xcite but the same is not true for ad .",
    "contrary to the phenomenon of ad in low dimensional systems with _ coupling time - delay _ , amplitude death in systems with _ intrinsic time - delay _ is a less explored topic .",
    "the first observation of ad in _ intrinsic time - delayed oscillators _",
    "( i.e. , oscillator with _ intrinsic time - delay _ ) has been reported by @xcite in which dynamic and delayed couplings were studied .",
    "ad in networks of delay - coupled delay oscillators has been studied analytically in ref .. ref .",
    "reports ad in intrinsic time - delayed oscillators coupled via multiple delay connections .",
    "recently , an important technique of inducing ad has been proposed in ref .  , which employ time - delayed open - plus - closed - loop coupling . in all of these works ( except the case of dynamic coupling ) , ad is mediated by the presence of moderate or very long time - delay in the coupling path .",
    "the presence of time - delay in coupling path makes the dynamics of the coupled systems more complex , and at the same time much difficult for analysis and practical implementation .    in this paper ,",
    "our aim is to study amplitude death and the corresponding synchronization transitions leading to ad in coupled _ intrinsic time - delayed _ hyperchaotic oscillators interacting through mean - field diffusive coupling .",
    "that is , the time - delay we are dealing with is the _ intrinsic time - delay _ associated with the individual systems , not the _ coupling time - delay_. we identify a _ novel _ synchronization transition scenario that leads to ad , namely the transitions among ad , _ generalized anticipatory synchronization _ ( gas ) , complete synchronization ( cs ) , and _ generalized lag synchronization _ ( gls ) ; this transition occurs for the variation of the difference of _ intrinsic time - delays _ , @xmath0 ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the intrinsic time - delays associated with two coupled systems ) .",
    "we show the occurrence of gas for @xmath3 , cs for @xmath4 , and gls for @xmath5 . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", this type of transition has not been reported in the literature yet ; also , it has no counterpart in oscillators with no intrinsic time - delay ( with or without couping time - delay ) .",
    "contrary to the transitions in oscillators with coupling time - delay ( see senthilkumar and lakshmanan of ref .",
    "28 that deals with the interplay of intrinsic and coupling delay ) , the transition reported here is related to the _ intrinsic time - delay _ associated with the individual systems .",
    "by definition@xcite , in the gas , cs , and gls conditions , there exists a smooth function @xmath6 such that @xmath7 , @xmath8 ; for gas , @xmath9 , and for gls , @xmath10 ; for conventional as and ls states @xmath6 is an identity function , i.e. , @xmath11 , and as usual , for a cs state , @xmath12 .",
    "earlier , it has been shown that mismatch in intrinsic time - delay in linearly coupled time - delay systems gives rise to generalized synchronization ( gs ) @xcite . in non - delayed systems , to observe gls and gas , appropriate controller has to be designed ; ref . reported two such controller design techniques to induce gls and gas in low dimensional systems under _ drive - response _ coupling . experimental confirmation of gls",
    "has been reported in ref . which consider rssler systems .",
    "unlike non - delayed systems , in our present case no controller is required but only variations of the intrinsic time - delay give rise to gas and gls .",
    "further , at present , there exists no general theory or confirmatory quantitative measures of gas and gls . in this paper",
    "we derive a general stability analysis ( under some constraints ) for the gas and gls states using krasovskii  lyapunov theory . also , we use error function and a modified form of the similarity function to provide the quantitative support to the occurrence of gas and gls .",
    "we further study the effect of coupling parameter for equal intrinsic time - delays .",
    "it is shown that depending upon the coupling strength and mean - field parameters , the coupled systems show a transition from the unsynchronized state to ad state via in - phase and complete synchronized states .",
    "the occurrence of cs and ad is predicted analytically using krasovskii ",
    "lyapunov theory and linear stability analysis , respectively .    to exemplify our study",
    ", we consider a prototype hyperchaotic system with intrinsic time - delay , recently proposed in ref . .",
    "we compute the lyapunov exponent ( le ) spectrum of the coupled systems , correlation of probability of recurrence , cross correlation functions , and eigenvalue spectrum to identify the synchronized states and ad state in the parameter space . finally , we set an electronic circuit experiment to demonstrate all the transition scenarios .",
    "experimental waveforms and phase - plane plots are used to visualize the transitions .",
    "we show that analytical and numerical results agree well with the experimental observations .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized in the following way : the next section describes the mathematical model of the time - delay systems under mean - field coupling . stability analysis is reported in section [ sec : stab ] .",
    "numerical simulation results are described in section [ sec : num ] .",
    "section [ sec : expt ] reports the experimental implementation of the coupled system and experimental demonstration of amplitude death .",
    "finally , we summarize the main observations of our study in section [ con ] .",
    "we consider @xmath13 number of first - order time - delay dynamical systems interacting through mean - field diffusive coupling ; mathematical model of the coupled system is given by @xmath14 with @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the mean - field of the coupled system .",

    "now , eq . becomes @xmath38 according to the krasovskii ",
    "lyapunov theory @xcite , a stable synchronization implies the stability of the origin of .",
    "the sufficient condition for the stability of synchronization requires the definition of a positive definite functional , @xmath39 , given by @xmath40 here @xmath41 is an arbitrary positive parameter .",
    "the stability of the origin of requires that the time derivative of @xmath39 be negative .",
    "now , @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",

    "now , we find the minimum value @xmath52 by setting @xmath53 . that gives @xmath54 . with this value of @xmath51 ,",

    "coupled via mean - field diffusion .      for the gas , gls cases we consider the following error function : @xmath59 , where @xmath60 . using this",
    "we can express three different synchronization phenomena , namely , generalized ( anticipatory , lag ) , and complete synchronization .",

    "it can be noted that for @xmath33 , i.e. complete synchronization , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 ; thus eq .",
    "reduces to eq . , and",

    "using the krasovskii  lyapunov theory and the same arguments of the previous subsections",
    "we arrive at the following stability condition for the generalized ( anticipatory , lag ) synchronization : @xmath78      next , to find out the condition of amplitude death we analyze the stability of synchronization by considering the deviations from the synchronized state . the same for the low - dimensional systems ( without intrinsic time - delay ) has been reported in ref . and",
