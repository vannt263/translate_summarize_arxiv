    "in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions , the roughness of a surface that grows on a one dimensional substrate of length @xmath0 can be expressed by the interface width @xmath1 at time @xmath2 @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the height of the column at site @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the average height .",
    "the angular brackets denote the average over many configurations and the bar over a symbol denotes the average over @xmath0 sites .",
    "the self - affined roughness of the interface manifests itself by the presence of the family - vicsek ( fv ) scaling @xcite : @xmath7 where the scaling function @xmath8 describes two regimes of the width evolution : @xmath9 the dynamic exponent @xmath10 gives the evolution of the lateral correlation length @xmath11 .",
    "when @xmath12 exceeds the system size @xmath0 the width saturates . at saturation , for @xmath13 , the width scales as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the roughness exponent .",
    "the growth phase is the initial phase for @xmath16 before the cross - over time @xmath17 to saturation .",
    "the growth phase is characterized by the single growth exponent @xmath18 .",
    "the roughness , growth and dynamic exponents are universal .",
    "their values depend only on the underlying mechanism that generates the correlations and scaling .",
    "a simple continuum model of nonequilibrium growth that leads to the scaling of a noise - driven interface is provided by the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation @xcite . in the co - moving frame , the kpz equation is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the height field ( subscripts denote partial derivatives ) .",
    "coefficients @xmath21 and @xmath22 give the strength of the linear damping and the coupling with nonlinear growth , respectively .",

    "( [ kpz ] ) , the growth belongs to the rd universality class , characterized by @xmath33 and the lack of saturation .",
    "the rd interface is not self - affined .    the theory behind kinetic roughening and the origins of scale invariance are well understood @xcite , but there are numerous instances of growth processes that neither follow one power law nor exhibit a clear - cut universality as it is expressed by the fv scaling .",
    "one group of examples is the anomalous roughening in epitaxial growth models @xcite , fractures @xcite and in models with subdiffusive behavior or quenched disorder @xcite .",
    "these systems exhibit different dynamic scaling on local and global scales , characterized by different values of roughness exponents .",
    "the super - rough dynamics of tumor growth @xcite is the first experimental observation of anomalous scaling in ( 1 + 1 ) dimension .",
    "another issue is the clear experimental observation of the kpz universality and the role of quenched noise in the asymptotic kpz scaling @xcite .",
    "for one dimensional kpz growth , by applying a weak noise canonical phase - space method , it has been shown recently that the kpz dynamic exponent is associated with the soliton dispersion law @xcite . however , at saturation all kpz correlations are exactly the same as would result from the linear ew equation @xcite . the fact that the ew equation is sort of  embedded \" in the kpz equation may give rise to ambiguous values of scaling exponents for growth mechanisms ( or models ) that interpolate between the weak and the strong nonlinear coupling regimes .",
    "even when the nonlinear coupling is strong the discrete models require sufficiently large length and time scales to show clear kpz scaling @xcite .",
    "likewise , large scales are essential in simulation studies of roughening in the two - component growth models that combine one process governed by linear ew dynamics with another process governed by nonlinear kpz dynamics @xcite .",
    "recently , chame and reis @xcite simulated in ( 1 + 1 ) dimension a mixed growth where particles aggregated either by ballistic deposition ( with probability @xmath34 ) or by random deposition with surface relaxation ( with probability @xmath35 ) .",
    "they show that for small @xmath34 and sufficiently large @xmath0 , the interface width has three well - defined evolution stages .",
    "the first stage , for early times , is the ew growth .",
    "the second stage , for intermediate times before saturation , is the kpz growth .",
    "the third stage is the saturation .",
    "two distinct growth phases were also observed in experiments with interfacial roughening in hele - shaw flows @xcite , in simulations of electrophoretic deposition of polymer chains @xcite and in numerical studies of one dimensional restricted solid - on - solid models with two growth components , each of which being a mechanism ruled by dynamics that belongs to a distinct universality class @xcite .",
    "the latter examples suggest that the two - phase growth may be an effect of mixing the universalities . in support of this hypothesis",
    "comes a two - component model considered by da silva and moreira @xcite , where the kim - kosterlitz @xcite deposition occurs with probability @xmath34 and ballistic deposition occurs with probability @xmath36 .",
    "both of these growth mechanisms are governed by the kpz dynamics , except that their corresponding continuum equations differ in the sign of the coupling @xmath22 . in this case ,",
    "large scale simulations in ( 1 + 1 ) dimension produce only one growth phase with the growth exponent @xmath37 parametrized by @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the purpose of roughening studies presented in this article is to uncover the dynamics of desynchronization in a conservative parallel discrete - event simulations ( pdes ) .",
    "the pdes are a technical tool to uncover the dynamics of information - driven complex stochastic systems .",
    "their wide range of applications in contemporary sciences and technology @xcite has made them an active area of research in recent years .",
    "parallel and distributed simulation systems constitute a complex system of their own , whose properties can be uncovered with the well - established tools of statistical physics .    in pdes physical processes",
    "are mapped to logical processes ( assigned to processors ) that manage state - updates of assigned physical subsystems .",
    "the main challenge arises because logical processes are not synchronized by a global clock .",
    "consequently , to preserve causality in pdes the algorithms should incorporate the so - called local causality constraint @xcite . depending on the way the local causality constraint",
    "is implemented , there are two broadly defined classes of update protocols @xcite : conservative algorithms @xcite and optimistic algorithms @xcite .",
    "important efficiency considerations of these algorithms involve the utilization of the parallel processing environment ( as measured by a fraction of processors working simultaneously at a time ) and the memory per processor required by state savings .",
    "the latter is closely related to the statistical spread in the processors local times , i.e. , to desynchronization .",
    "recent applications of conservative pdes to modeling complex physics systems include ballistic deposition @xcite , ising spins @xcite and dynamic phase transition @xcite . in an application to simulating ising spins , an onset of self - organized critical behavior in optimistic pdes",
    "has been recently reported @xcite .    since the introduction by korniss _",
    "@xcite an idea of utilizing nonequilibrium surface growth methods @xcite in evaluating the scalability of algorithms for conservative pdes , there have been a number of advances using such efforts . the main concept behind this idea is the virtual time horizon ( vth ) of the algorithm .",
    "the vth is a ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional nonequilibrium surface .",
    "its time evolution can be simulated by applying a deposition rule that is defined by a parallel - update protocol based on the algorithm .",
    "several properties of the algorithm can be deduced from analyzing its corresponding simulated vth .",
    "one of them is the utilization @xcite .",
    "another one is the desynchronization of processors in the system as the pdes evolves in time .",
    "the width of the simulated vth provides a measure of this desynchronization .",
    "it has been demonstrated that an asymptotic lack of synchronization @xcite can be avoided in new generations of algorithms @xcite .",
    "the focus of past studies was on the worst - case performance scenario when each parallel process consisted of only one computational object ( or computational volume ) . despite being informative ( e.g. , providing the evidence of",
    "a lower bound on the utilization ) such studies are of little practical value since taking full advantage of parallelization implies many computational objects per processor .",
    "past simulation studies have demonstrated that when the load per processor is increased the utilization increases significantly @xcite , and a mean - field - like method to estimate the utilization in this general case has been developed @xcite .",
    "the missing element thus far has been a detailed investigation of the dynamic scaling properties of the simulated vth for the general case of many computational objects per processor .",
    "this is the main theme of this article .",
    "we simulate three growth mechanisms for the vth that correspond to three implementations of a conservative update algorithm in a ring communication topology , where each processor communicates only with its immediate neighbors .",
    "the models are variations of poisson - random depositions .",
    "two of these rules are realizations of the worst - case scenarios and present a situation when the system of @xmath0 processors can be mapped onto a closed chain of @xmath0 spins .",
    "the third model corresponds to the general case when each processor carries @xmath38 computational volumes and it combines the second model with random deposition ( rd ) . in this work , we do not attempt to obtain exact values of scaling exponents that characterize these growth processes .",
    "our primary interests are in the scaling functions for the interface width and in the universal properties of the vth interfaces",
    ".    simulation studies of the vth interface in the worst - case scenario showed that for very large @xmath0 this interface belongs to the kpz universality class @xcite .",
    "however , for small @xmath0 or for early times , before the kpz growth is attained , the width does not scale .",
    "this suggests the strong sensitivity of the evolution to the initial condition . when the model is generalized to accommodate many computational volumes per processor , the evolution of the vth width changes .",
    "now there are two distinct phases in the growth regime .",
    "the early phase evolves in the rd fashion and the later phase has signatures of the kpz scaling . in this work",
    "we investigate the above issues in large - scale simulations .",

    "[ summary ] .",
    "in simulations a system of @xmath0 processors is represented as a set of equally spaced lattice points @xmath5 , @xmath41 .",
    "each processor performs a number of operations and enters a communication phase to exchange information with its immediate neighbors .",
    "this communication phase , called an update attempt , takes no time in our simulations . in this sense",
    "we simulate an ideal system of processors ( the relation to pdes is discussed in sec .",
    "[ application ] ) .",
    "an update attempt is assigned an integer index @xmath2 that has the meaning of a wall - clock time ( in arbitrary units ) .",
    "the local virtual time @xmath4 at the @xmath5th processor site represents the cumulative local time of all operations on the @xmath5th processor from the beginning at @xmath42 to time @xmath2 .",
    "these local processor times are not synchronized by a global clock .",
    "the ring communication topology among processors is mapped onto a lattice arrangement with periodic boundary conditions , @xmath43 .",
    "the set of local virtual times @xmath4 forms the vth at @xmath2 .",
    "the growth of the vth is simulated by a deposition rule , where local height increments @xmath44 are sampled from the poisson distribution of unit mean .",
    "the form of the deposition rule depends on the processor load , as explained below .    a general principle that governs the conservative update protocol requires a processor to idle if at the update attempt @xmath2 the local causality constraint may be violated .",
    "this happens when at @xmath2 the @xmath5th processor does not receive the information from its neighboring processor ( or processors ) if such information is required to proceed in its computation .",
    "this corresponds to a situation when the local virtual time @xmath4 of the @xmath5th processor is ahead of either one of the local virtual times @xmath45 or @xmath46 of its left and right neighbors , respectively . in this unsuccessful update attempt",
    "the local virtual time @xmath4 is not incremented , i.e. , the @xmath5th processor waits : @xmath47 . in another case , for example",
    ", when at @xmath2 the @xmath5th processor does not need information from its neighbors it performs an update regardless of the relation between its local virtual time and the local virtual times on neighboring processors .",
    "one example of computations that follow the above model is a dynamic monte carlo simulation for ising spins . in a parallel environment ,",
    "a spin lattice is spatially distributed among @xmath0 processors in such a way that each processor carries an equal load of one contiguous sublattice that consists of @xmath38 spin sites ( i.e. , each processor has a load of @xmath38 volumes ) .",
    "some of these @xmath38 spin - lattice sites belong to border slices , i.e. , at least one of their immediate neighbors resides on the sublattice of a neighboring processor .",
    "processors perform concurrent spin - flip operations ( i.e. , increment their local virtual times ) as long as a randomly selected spin - site is not a border site .",
    "if a border spin - site is selected , to perform a state update that is consistent with and faithful to the underlying physical spin dynamics , a processor needs to know the current spin - state of the corresponding border slice of its neighbor .",
    "if this information is not available at the @xmath2 update attempt ( because the neighbor s local time is behind ) , by the conservative update rule the processor waits until this information becomes available , i.e. , until the neighbor s local virtual time catches up with or passes its own local virtual time .",
    "the least favorable parallelization is when each processor carries one computational volume , @xmath48 .",
    "computationally , this system can be identified with a closed spin chain where each processor carries one spin - site . at each update attempt each processor must compare its local virtual time with the local times on both of its neighbors .",
    "the second least favorable arrangement is when processors have a computational volume @xmath49 .",
    "as before , the system can be mapped onto a closed spin chain where each processor carries two spin - sites , each of which is a border site . at each update attempt every processor must compare its local time with the local time of one of its neighbors .    in general , when @xmath50 , at update attempt @xmath2 , the comparison of the local virtual times between neighbors is required only if the randomly selected volume site is from a border slice . in all cases , we start the simulation from a flat substrate at @xmath42 , @xmath51 .    at every successful update attempt , the simulated local virtual time at the @xmath5th site",
    "is incremented for the next update attempt : @xmath52 , where @xmath53 , and @xmath54 $ ] is a uniform random deviate .",
    "the three cases described above are realized in simulations by the following three deposition rules .",
    "+ * rule 1 @xmath55 : * the update attempt at @xmath2 is successful iff @xmath56 * rule 2 @xmath57 : * at any site @xmath5 where the update attempt was successful at @xmath58 , at @xmath2 we first randomly select a neighbor ( left or right ) .",
    "this is equivalent to selecting either the left or the right border slice on the @xmath5th processor .",
    "the update attempt is successful iff @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the randomly selected neighbor ( @xmath61 for the left , @xmath62 for the right ) . at any site @xmath5 where the update attempt was not successful at @xmath58 , at @xmath2 we keep the last @xmath60 value . +",

    "the selected site can be either from the border sites ( either @xmath65 or @xmath66 ) or from the interior .",
    "the attempt is successful if the selected site is the interior site . when the border site is selected , the attempt is successful if condition  ( [ rule2 ] ) is satisfied . as in rule @xmath67 , at any site @xmath5 where the update attempt was not successful at @xmath58 , at @xmath2 we keep the last @xmath64 value .",
    "rule @xmath68 is essentially different from rules @xmath69 and @xmath67 in that it is a mixture of rule @xmath67 and rd . at each @xmath2 , depending on the selected @xmath64 , the local update ( deposition ) at site @xmath5 either follows rule @xmath67 that requires checking with a neighbor or follows rd that just simply deposits a random positive real number @xmath44 .",
    "the probability @xmath36 that the rule @xmath68 takes the form of rd is parametrized by @xmath38 . at each @xmath2 ,",
    "the complementary probability @xmath34 that rule @xmath68 takes the form of rule @xmath67 can be obtained by a direct count of lattice sites that have the assigned value either @xmath65 or @xmath66 , and subsequently taking the configurational mean of this count .",
    "the mean density of these sites can be interpreted as the probability @xmath70 that at @xmath2 a randomly selected site followed rule @xmath67 . in steady - state simulations ( defined in sec .",
    "[ flat ] ) this density does not depend on @xmath2 and is found to be approximately @xmath71 .",
    "this is because in simulating conservative pdes the random selection of volume site @xmath64 is not performed at every @xmath2 for all lattice sites @xmath5 .",
    "if at some @xmath2 the update condition  ( [ rule2 ] ) is not satisfied , the selection of @xmath64 must be postponed until some later time @xmath72 when condition  ( [ rule2 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "explicitly , in the spirit of conservative pdes , if relation  ( [ rule2 ] ) does not hold then the old @xmath64 is kept for as many update steps as required until it finally holds at later @xmath72 . note , if the draw of @xmath64 were performed at each @xmath2 for all @xmath5 the probability of selecting a border site would have been @xmath73 , i.e. , smaller than @xmath34 .",
    "we define the utilization @xmath74 as the configurational average of the fraction of sites that performed an update at @xmath2 . when @xmath48 , @xmath74 is simply the mean density of local minima of the interface . when @xmath75 , @xmath74 is the mean density of update sites .",
    "the velocity @xmath76 of the interface is defined as @xmath77 .",
    "one distinction between the deposition models studied here and other restricted solid - on - solid models is that in the former the deposited random height increment @xmath78 is a positive real number that can take on any value from an assigned real interval , while the latter usually consider integer height increments .",
    "although in the context of applications to pdes this is the poisson distribution with mean @xmath79 and unit variance that models the waiting times , represented here by @xmath78 , we also consider two other alternative depositions .",

    "the first phase is the processing of the assigned set of discrete events ( e.g. , spin flipping on the assigned sublattice ) .",
    "this phase is followed by a messaging phase that closes the cycle , when a processor broadcasts its findings to other processors .",
    "but the messages broadcasted by other processors may arrive any time during the cycle .",

    "we model an ideal system of processors .",
    "the local virtual time of a cycle represents only the time that logical processes require to complete the first phase of a cycle .",
    "therefore , the spread in local virtual times represents only the desynchronisation that arises due to the conservative algorithm alone .",
    "the measure of this desynchronization is provided by @xmath225 . since in pdes",
    "the memory request per processor , required for past - state savings , is determined by the extent to which processors get desynchronized , @xmath225 can be considered as an indirect approximate measure of this memory request .",

    "the characteristic time scale @xmath164 from the first step to the steady - state simulations can be estimated by monitoring the utilization for the minimal processor load ( to determine @xmath102 ) and , subsequently , scaling this time with @xmath38 .",
    "similarly , the characteristic time scale to @xmath326 , when the desynchronization reaches its steady state , can be scaled with the processor load to determine an approximate number of simulation steps to the point when the mean memory request does not grow anymore .    during the steady state simulations the utilization @xmath221 is given by the approximate eq .",
    "( [ steadyu ] ) , where @xmath219 . the smallest utilization @xmath327 for any processor load",

    "this nonzero lower bound on the utilization and the finite upper bound for the memory request for finite @xmath0 show that conservative pdes are generally scalable with the number of computing processors when performed in the ring communication topology .",
    "the extension of this conclusion to other communication topologies requires a separate study .",
    "we considered a two - component growth in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "one of the components is rd that takes place with probability @xmath36 .",
    "the other component , which takes place with probability @xmath34 , is a deposition process that generates correlations typical of kpz dynamics .",
    "the growth is simulated from an initially flat substrate .",
    "we show that the flat - substrate initial condition is responsible for the existence of the initial non - scaling regime in simulations .",
    "the length of this initial phase is a nonuniversal parameter ( it depends on the type of depositions and on the particulars of the model ) .",
    "however , its presence is a universal phenomenon .    during the initial phase the simulations relax to a steady state . for the models considered in this work , the transition time to the steady state",
    "can be defined as the time when the mean interface velocity attains a constant value .",
    "we showed that for these models the mean interface velocity is a multiple of the mean utilization .    during the steady state",
    "the interface width satisfies fv scaling .",
    "we derived the universal scaling function for the width and showed that the rd admixture acts as a dilatation mechanism to the time and height scales , but leaves the kpz correlations intact .",
    "this conclusion has been generalized to two - component models that mix rd with depositions that classify within the ew universality class .",
    "in particular , we showed that the rd admixture is responsible for the @xmath34 dependent affine change of scales ( @xmath338 and @xmath339 ) that is superimposed on the usual scaling and leaves the dynamics invariant .",
    "the models , studied in this work , that give rise to the kpz correlations are the poisson- , the gauss- , and the uniform - random depositions either to local interface minima or to local minima and randomly selected local slopes . despite that the simulated interfaces belong to the kpz universality class , the precise value of their roughness exponent depends on the deposition type .",
    "this observation suggests that such noisy deposition mechanisms may produce relatively long - scale temporal correlations .",
    "secondly , this small departure from the exact value is nonuniversal .",
    "further studies are required to investigate this issue .    in application to conservative pdes",
    ", we showed that the memory request per processor , required for state savings , does not grow without limit for a finite number of processors and a finite load per processor but varies as the pdes evolve .",
    "the important consequence of the derived scaling is the existence of the upper bound for the desynchronization , thus , for this memory request . also , the utilization of the parallel processing environment has a non - zero lower bound as the number of processors increases infinitely .",
