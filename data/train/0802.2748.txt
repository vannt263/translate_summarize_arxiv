    "to understand the inner workings of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) central engines , it is necessary to constrain their true energy release . if a redshift is known , the isotropic energy release in gamma - rays , @xmath4 , is a readily measurable quantity .",
    "the `` energy crisis '' brought on by implied energy releases of @xmath5 erg ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was resolved when it was realized that grb blast waves are collimated with opening angles @xmath6 of 2 - 30@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "thus the beaming - corrected gamma - ray energy release , @xmath8 , is smaller than @xmath9 by a factor @xmath10 .",
    "whatever energy is not released in the prompt emission powers a relativistic blast wave that plows into the circumburst medium ( cbm ) .",
    "measuring the kinetic energy of this outflow , @xmath11 , is challenging because only a fraction of this energy is radiated .",
    "several methods have been used in this endeavor ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the simplest method , using only the x - ray afterglow light curve ,",
    "was suggested by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "provided that the x - rays are predominately synchrotron and the electrons radiate in the cooling regime , this method yields the energy per unit solid angle and the fraction of the shock energy carried by electrons @xmath12 . for those afterglows with high quality multiwavelength data sets , a fit of the data can be made using models that describe the dynamics of jet / circumburst interaction and that calculate the expected synchrotron and inverse compton emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . finally , for bright , long - lived afterglows , @xmath11 can be measured more robustly using the late - time radio light curve",
    ". months or in some cases years after the burst , the blast wave becomes sub - relativistic ( i.e. sedov self - similar evolution ) and the outflow is expected to be quasi - spherical ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "early studies , based on these methods , suggested that the energy release of long - duration grbs lies within a narrow range with a mean of @xmath13 erg ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "there are several problems with this simple picture , however , and the true situation is likely more complicated .",
    "for example , energy input into the blast wave now appears to extend beyond the prompt emission and into the afterglow phase .",
    "this could be due either to a long - lived central engine or slow - moving ejecta that take a long time to reach the shock front @xcite .",
    "the simple pictures of collimated explosions has been challenged by _ swift _  detected grbs .",
    "kocevski & butler ( 2007 ) give an excellent summary of the difficulties and their implications for collimation - corrected energy release @xmath14 .",
    "if ( for whatever reason ) the _ swift _  sample of bursts has no jet breaks then we are faced with a growing number of grbs that ( by virtue of inferred isotropic energy release ) are hyper - energetic i.e.  well in excess of the canonical 10@xmath15 erg ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "these modulations are likely due to scintillation caused by interstellar propagation effects .",
    "we obtained long - duration observations of the afterglow of grb070125 at 8.5 ghz on three separate occasions : february 7 ( 5.5 hour duration ) , february 8 ( 4 hour duration ) , and february 14 ( 8 hour duration ) .",
    "the data were split into 20minute blocks and imaged in order to extract information on the fast variability of the source .",
    "grb070125 exhibits flux density variations with a significance exceeding 99.8% on each of the three epochs ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : scint ] ) .",
    "the reduced @xmath73 values for the hypothesis of no variability are 2.31 ( with 17 degrees of freedom ) , 4.42 ( 10 d.o.f . ) and 2.84 ( 23 d.o.f . ) for the three dates , respectively .",
    "we used intensity structure functions to determine the variability timescale on each date . while the short baseline hindered a definitive determination",
    ", we tentatively identify breaks with @xmath74% accuracy at @xmath75 and @xmath76 s , in the three structure functions .",
    "the breaks are marginally significant in the data from 7 february and 8 february , but not so prominent in the 14 february images .",
    "this can be explained by quenching of the scintillation as the source expands at late times .",
    "these measurements are congruent with the timescales of the peaks and troughs apparent in the corresponding centimeter - wavelength lightcurves ( fig .",

    "strong chromatic scintillations is possible only for sources smaller than @xmath79 .",
    "these lead to the following two conditions @xcite :    @xmath80    @xmath81    where sm is the scattering measure and @xmath82 is the effective distance to the scattering material , which is essentially the galactic ionized medium @xcite . to determine this",

    "however , given the paucity of our knowledge of the distribution of scattering material off the galactic plane , these estimates should be taken with caution .",
    "strong scintillation can be diffractive as well refractive in nature .",
    "diffractive scintillation of a point - like source is characterized by variations with a modulation index ( @xmath87 ) close to unity , where the modulation index is a measure of how much the modulated flux varies around its intrinsic flux density level .",

    "the timescale of diffractive scintillation can be expressed as : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the speed of the scattering material transverse to the line of sight .",
    "the decorrelation bandwidth ( @xmath95 ) for diffractive scintillation is then @xcite : @xmath96    using the variability timescale of @xmath97s measured on 8 february , along with @xmath98kms@xmath99 , we infer a scattering measure of @xmath100 . in eq .",

    "variability due to refractive scintillation is expected at late stages , even after the source has expanded sufficiently .",
    "refractive scintillations are expected to be broadband in nature and start dominating once diffractive scintillations are quenched .",
    "the source exhibited refractive scintillation during the two months subsequent to 2007 february 8 , as can be seen from the first 70days of the 8.46ghz data plotted in figure  [ fig : refscint ] .    in a standard grb afterglow model ,",

    "earlier we confine our discussion to the ism model . here",

    "ic scattering delays the cooling time by a fraction @xmath184 @xcite , i.e. the cooling time in presence of the ic effect is @xmath185d .",

    "the figure clearly shows that ic scattering flattens the light curve and delays the jet break to later time .",
    "what happens after day @xmath207 is unknown due to the lack of x - ray detection of the afterglow .",
    "while we have strong evidence that ic effects delay the x - ray jet break in grb070125 , we would like to know if this effect could be seen in other grbs as well . in the pre-_swift _  era , the x - ray data were not sufficiently well sampled to search for jet breaks , and so collimation corrections were almost exclusively calculated in the optical bands . in the _ swift _  era , with a plethora of well - sampled xrt light curves , we may be missing the jet break due to ic effects in many grbs .",
    "the radio afterglow is not useful in determining the jet break , since grbs most likely scintillate in radio bands at such early times .",

    "@xcite have shown that the late time flattening in the x - ray light curve of xrf050406 can be explained as an effect of ic scattering . for inverse compton scattering to play an important role , the electron energy density fraction ( @xmath12 )",
    "must be larger than the magnetic energy density fraction ( @xmath209 ) .",
    "recently , @xcite has discussed chromatic breaks occurring due to scattering of the forward - shock synchrotron emission by a relativistic outflow located behind the leading blast - wave .",
    "this model may have x - ray jet breaks showing up at later times than the optical breaks .",
    "however , this model requires a long - lived central engine , which may not be the case with most of the grbs .      with grb070125 ,",
    "we now have found three _ swift _  events with total energy release in excess of @xmath121erg : grb050904 @xcite and grb050820a @xcite .",
    "while both grb050904 and grb050820a appear to have exploded in an dense circum - burst medium , the lack of a bright radio afterglow from grb050820a indicates a more typical environment .",
    "moreover , with the exception of the total energy release , other parameters derived from broadband modeling are in line with previous studies of less energetic grbs @xcite .",
    "it seems likely , therefore , that some factor intrinsic to the progenitor system is responsible for the large energy release .    at first blush",
    ", it seems surprising that _ swift _  has detected three of the most energetic grbs ever . with its increase high - energy sensitivity , _",
    "swift_should preferentially select grbs at the low end of the fluence distribution .",
    "we note , however , that a strong selection bias exists . as first noted by @xcite , in many _ swift _",
    "x - ray light curves , the last xrt measurement is not sufficient to rule out a collimation - corrected prompt energy release of @xmath13erg . similarly , in the optical bandpass , @xcite have shown that at least some jet breaks occur at late times beyond the sensitivity of medium aperture facilities .    while a detailed discussion of the relative rates of hyper - energetic events is still premature , it is clear at this point that , at the very least , the prompt @xmath0-ray energy distribution is significantly broader than previously believed @xcite . coupled with the recent controversy surrounding the validity of the many high - energy correlations ( e.g.  @xcite ) , we believe the future utility of grbs as cosmological probes is significantly lessened .",
    "even more importantly , however , hyper - energetic grbs have important consequences for progenitor models .",
    "sustained engine activity has been seen now in many grbs @xcite .",
    "this poses a problem for the collapsar model , as the duration of the central engine should not significantly exceed the accretion time scale onto the remnant black hole @xcite .",
    "late - time engine activity is naturally accommodates by models in which the central object is a magnetar @xcite .",
    "the existence of hyper - energetic grbs , however , is a direct and severe challenge to the magnetar model .    with the current rate of hyper - energetic events ( @xmath211yr@xmath99 ) , coupled with the difficulty in measuring late jet breaks for more typical _ swift_events , future prospects look grim .",
    "however , the impending launch of _ glast _ offers a new hope in the study of grb energetics .",
    "much like blazars , those grbs capable of producing gev photons detectable by the large area telescope should be the most energetic and narrowly beamed events . together , synergistic _",
    "glast _ and _ swift _  observations in the coming years should be able to shed light on the opening angles and energy release of a large sample of grbs .",
    "our observations presented here , particularly the bright , self - absorbed radio afterglow , indicate grb070125 exploded in a dense circum - burst medium . in a separate work , however , @xcite have reported spectroscopic observations indicating an environment almost completely devoid of absorbing material .",
    "@xcite furthermore find no evidence of an underlying host galaxy to deep ( @xmath212mag ) limits .",
    "we briefly reiterate here the resolution of this apparent paradox .",
    "the key to understanding the environment of grb070125 is to note that the broadband afterglow emission and the super - posed spectroscopic absorption features derive from distinct physical regions .",
    "afterglow emission is caused by electrons in the circum - burst medium accelerated by the outgoing blastwave ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "these electrons reside relatively close to the explosion center , typically at radii @xmath213pc .",
    "we have strong evidence , however , that the absorption features seen super - posed on grb afterglow spectra derive from material at significantly larger distances from the explosion site : @xmath214kpc , or within the host galaxy ism . evidence in support of this large distance comes primarily from two lines of argument .",
    "first , the presence of indicates a large distance from the explosion site , as the first ionization energy of mg falls below 1 ryd , and thus any mg near the grb would be ionized to at least @xcite .",
    "second , @xcite have reported the detection of variability in the fine structure levels of from uv pumping for grb060418 . by modeling the variability over time , they were able to measure the grb - absorber distance : @xmath215kpc .    while this explains the apparent density paradox , we are still left to explain how a dense circum - burst medium could be embedded in such a tenuous ism .",
    "taking a clue from the lack of an underlying host detection , we suggested grb070125 may have exploded in a dense stellar cluster enriched by galaxy interactions .",
    "star formation in such extreme environments can be seen in the local universe ( e.g.  tadpole galaxy ; @xcite ) , and under our hierarchical picture of galaxy formation , such interactions should have occurred more frequently at @xmath216 .",
    "the report of the detection of a faint source at the afterglow location at late times @xcite may call this interpretation into question , although it is unclear whether this emission is attributable to the fading afterglow or an underlying host ( or some combination thereof ) .",
    "regardless , future high - resolution imaging ( i.e.  _ hst _ ) seems worthwhile to pin down the environment of this truly unique event .",
    "grb 070125  was not detected at @xmath217 d with the wsrt , and then was detected by both the vla and the wsrt around day 5 .",
    "it remained below detection level for the next 15 days , before rebrightening on day 22 .",
    "we explore the possibility that the flux from the grb at @xmath218d could be emission from a reverse shock .",
    "we first consider the possibility that the non - detection was caused by modulations due to scintillation .",
    "the modulation in flux density due to the refractive scintillation can decrease the flux density at the most up to @xmath219jy . to check for this possibility , we combined all the eight observations taken during the 15 day non - detection phase .",
    "this vastly improved the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the flux density we obtained at the grb position is @xmath220 @xmath55jy , much lower than scintillation can explain .    according to the internal - external shock model for grbs , the prompt emission",
    "is produced by internal shocks within a relativistic outflow , while the afterglow is produced by external shocks with the interstellar medium .",
    "the reverse shock has a much lower temperature than that of the forward shock so it radiates at considerably lower frequencies . in this scenario using the ism model , the reverse shock emission peaks in the optical band at @xcite : @xmath221 for grb 070125 we calculate @xmath222 sec .",
    "this corresponds to the time of peak in the radio band to be : @xmath223 here @xmath224 is the synchrotron self - absorption frequency , which can be written as @xcite : @xmath225^{2/(p+4)}.\\ ] ] for values obtained from our multiwavelength analysis , we calculate @xmath226 hz and @xmath227 2.25 days . hence , the reverse shock emission peaks in the radio bands around @xmath228d .",
    "we now estimate the peak radio flux density for the reverse shock . this can be written as : @xmath229 where @xmath230 is the peak optical flux density expressed as @xcite : @xmath231 for our best fit parameters , this value is @xmath211 mjy , which a gives the peak radio flux density to be @xmath232jy , which is two orders on magnitude than the observed one .",
    "this shows that a reverse shock is not strong enough to explain the detection on day 5 .",
    "we can not explain this strange behavior .",
    "one of the major concerns for grb 070125  is the difference between the isotropic @xmath0-ray energy obtained from the high - energy fluence and the isotropic - equivalent blastwave energy obtained from our best fit model on the day when @xmath169 .",
    "the isotropic - equivalent kinetic energy is an order of magnitude smaller than the isotropic @xmath0-ray energy ( @xmath233 erg ,  [ sec : energetics ] ) .",
    "however , at very early times , the afterglow is in the fast cooling regime , where it undergoes significant loss of the energy because it is highly radiative .",

    "from @xcite we find : @xmath234 for the ism model and @xmath235 for the wind model .",

    "however , the wind model requires an electron energy density fraction close to 1 , which is very unlikely .",
    "the best fit parameters in the wind model are rather unphysical , with less constrained boundaries . however , fixing the electron energy fraction to be 0.4 also gives reasonable fits .",
    "evidence favoring the ism model comes from the fireball size estimation from the scintillation data .",
    "however , the uncertainties in the diffraction scintillation time estimates may bring large uncertainties in the size estimates .",
    "based on the energetics arguments stated above , the ism model is favored over the wind model , but we can by no means definitely dismiss the latter .",

    "simultaneous fitting to optical and x - ray data favors a jet break at day 3.78 than the single powerlaw model .",
    "the evidence for the jet break is indisputable in the optical @xmath41 and @xmath240 bands with pre - break and post - break slopes being 1.73 and 2.49 respectively .",
    "however , the jet break is not very prominent in the x - ray band .",
    "when we do the independent fit to optical and x - ray bands , the optical best fit is consistent with our joint fit .",

    "we show that the inverse compton effects will dominate throughout our observations with pronounced effects in x - ray frequencies .",
    "these effects delay the jet break in the x - ray band .",
    "we had long observations of the grb at three epochs in the 8 ghz band .",
    "these data gave evidence for diffractive scintillations , which gave an upper limit on the size of the fireball after the jet break , until the sedov - taylor phase started .",
    "this estimate of the fireball size is consistent with the one obtained from the broadband modeling in a constant density medium .",
    "we obtained synchrotron self absorption frequency estimates at various epochs from the vla radio data .",
    "the evolution of the synchrotron self absorption frequency is @xmath242 , which is consistent with the one expected ( @xmath243 ) in the standard afterglow model .",

    "the radiative efficiency of the grb is very high ( @xmath244 ) .",
    "we suggest that ic scattering is a potential candidate in flattening the light curve and delay the jet break in other _ swift _  events and explain the absence of a jet break in x - ray light curves of some of the _ swift _  bursts .",

    "frequent radio measurements are necessary to measure the circumburst density of the medium .",

    "<S> we present a comprehensive multiwavelength analysis of the bright , long duration gamma - ray burst grb 070125 , comprised of observations in @xmath0-ray , x - ray , optical , millimeter and centimeter wavebands . </S>",
    "<S> simultaneous fits to the optical and x - ray light curves favor a break on day 3.78 , which we interpret as the jet break from a collimated outflow . </S>",
    "<S> independent fits to optical and x - ray bands give similar results in the optical bands but shift the jet break to around day 10 in the x - ray light curve . </S>",
    "<S> we show that for the physical parameters derived for grb 070125 , inverse compton scattering effects are important throughout the afterglow evolution . </S>",
    "<S> while inverse compton scattering does not affect radio and optical bands , it may be a promising candidate to delay the jet break in the x - ray band . </S>",
    "<S> radio light curves show rapid flux variations , which are interpreted as due to interstellar scintillation , and are used to derive an upper limit of @xmath1 cm on the radius of the fireball in the lateral expansion phase of the jet . </S>",
    "<S> radio light curves and spectra suggest a high synchrotron self absorption frequency indicative of the afterglow shock wave moving in a dense medium . </S>",
    "<S> our broadband modeling favors a constant density profile for the circumburst medium over a wind - like profile ( @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , keeping in mind the uncertainty of the parameters , it is difficult to unambiguously distinguish between the two density profiles . </S>",
    "<S> our broadband fits suggest that grb 070125   is a burst with high radiative efficiency ( @xmath3 ) . </S>"
