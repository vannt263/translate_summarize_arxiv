    "this could imply that the h layer for sn 2013df may have been more substantial ( larger mass , larger radius ) at explosion , as suggested as well by the post - breakout light - curve behavior of sn  2013df , relative to sn 1993j .",

    "the timescale for the transition redward for massive stars across the hr diagram is comparatively fast , and the stars will subsequently sit at the rsg locus for the majority of their post - main - sequence evolution . in a binary model , mass transfer will truncate the outer radius of the donor star , resulting in a hotter photosphere ; however , the core nuclear - burning luminosity will be relatively unaffected .",

    "the sn 2013df progenitor would have had to be cooler and also potentially more luminous .",
    "however , to be cooler would require the extinction to be even lower than the small amount that we have estimated .",
    "additionally , the somewhat larger bolometric correction with the lower temperature would be offset by the smaller extinction correction , leading , ultimately , to very little change in the estimated luminosity . at the least , we can say that the sn 2013df and sn 1993j progenitor stars appear to have been relatively comparable in nature .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that sn  2013df in ngc 4414 is a sn  iib , based on early - time photometry and spectroscopy , and that its properties are most similar to those of sn  1993j . however , the mass of @xmath0ni synthesized in the explosion likely differed from that in sne  1993j , 2008ax , and 2011dh . furthermore , the light curves of sn  2013df  specifically , the late cooling from post - shock - breakout maximum",
    " indicate that its progenitor must have been more extended in radius than that of sn 1993j . using archival pre - sn , high spatial resolution _",
    "images , together with _",
    "hst _ images of sn  2013df ,",
    "we have identified a star that we consider to be the likely sn progenitor ; it had @xmath89 k and @xmath90 .",
    "ultimately , verification of this identification of the sn  2013df progenitor should occur when the sn itself has greatly faded , as has been done for the sne  iib 1993j @xcite and 2011dh @xcite .",
    "this can be accomplished with high - quality images obtained with _",
    "deep , very late - time _",
    "imaging in the blue or ultraviolet could reveal a putative blue binary companion star at the sn location , although the fact that sn 2013df is at least a factor of two more distant than both sne 2011dh and 1993j could make such a detection a more challenging prospect .",
