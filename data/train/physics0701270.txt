    "the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) is poised to start operation soon and ramp up to a luminosity of 10@xmath0 @xmath1s@xmath2 . to be able to cope with the high levels of radiation expected in the inner tracking devices a new technology has been developed : the so called `` n - on - n '' silicon micropattern detectors have replaced the conventional `` p - on - n '' used for decades in si microstrip devices . in this approach , the charge signal collecting electrodes are implemented with @xmath3 implants on an @xmath4-type substrate , while the @xmath5 implant extends throughout the back plane of the device .",
    "one of the reasons underlying this choice is the discovery of `` type - inversion '' @xcite .",
    "radiation damage introduces electrically active defects in the band gap that change several sensor properties , in particular they alter the effective doping concentration @xmath6 .",
    "the study of the @xmath6 evolution lead to the discovery of the phenomenon of `` charge inversion '' , naively defined as a change in the @xmath6 sign ( transformation into a `` p - type '' equivalent substrate ) .",
    "this effective doping concentration is described with the equation @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the initial doping concentration , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are empirical parameters accounting for the donor removal and the acceptor - like defect addition rates as a function of the radiation dose @xmath11 .",
    "this is an effective parametrization ; studies have shown that a `` double - junction '' model @xcite , where the main junction is at the @xmath3-bulk interface , provides a better description of the device properties after high radiation doses .",
    "after type inversion , `` n - on - n '' device achieve much better charge collection efficiency that conventional devices .",
    "thus atlas @xcite , cms @xcite , and lhcb@xcite use this technology for their tracking subsystems exposed to the largest radiation doses .",
    "an upgrade of lhc ( slhc ) is planned to achieve a luminosity of the order of 10@xmath12 @xmath13s@xmath2 , a factor of 10 higher than the lhc design luminosity .",
    "a corresponding increase in the expected radiation doses is a natural consequence .",
    "thus new technologies are being studied to be used in the hottest detector regions .",
    "one of the drawbacks of the `` n - on - n '' technology is the high field at the backplane junction in the early stages of operation of the detectors , prior to radiation damage .",
    "because of this , `` n - on - n '' detectors are produced with a double - sided technology : implants in the back side include complex guard ring structures that have the goal of providing a controlled drop of the voltage from the biasing implant to the edge of the device .",
    "moreover , the high field region produces a quickest charge collection and thus it is desirable to have it always close to the signal collection electrode .",
    "although many devices have been produced with the `` n - on - n '' technology , options that could overcome these limitations have been sought .",
    "high resistivity , detector grade p - type substrates provide a very promising solution to satisfy the radiation resistance requirements in a very cost effective manner .",
    "one of the main technological challenges in the fabrication of `` n - in - p '' devices is the achievement of a good inter - electrode isolation .",
    "this is because the positive charge in the sio@xmath14 oxide induces an electron accumulation layer at the oxide - si interface that would electrically connect all the sensing elements if no isolation mechanism were introduced .",
    "this is an old problem , addressed for the first time when double - sided si microstrip devices were introduced @xcite , but it is still challenging the ingenuity of device designers and foundries .",
    "the charge density in the accumulation layer increases with the radiation dose , up to a level known as the `` oxide saturation charge '' .",
    "interstrip isolation must guarantee a high inter - electrode resistance throughout the sensor lifetime , without adversely affecting the electrical performance of the device .",
    "three approaches commonly used are known as p - stop , p - spray , and moderated p - spray .",
    "the p - stop method is based on p - type implants surrounding the n@xmath15 collection electrode .",
    "`` n - in - p '' sensors with p - stop interstrip isolation have been shown to feature higher radiation resistance than sensors of equal geometry implemented with `` n - in - n '' technology @xcite .",
    "however p - stop implants require an additional mask , and they suffer from pre - breakdown micro - discharges that deteriorate the noise performance of the sensors implemented with this interstrip insulation .",
    "a commonly used alternative is the `` p - spray '' technique , where a uniform p - type blanket is implanted throughout the active surface of the device .",
    "the n@xmath15 implants have sufficient dose to overcompensate this p - type layer in the regions where charge collection electrodes are planned . thus the additional mask is no longer needed . on the other hand , in this case",
    "it is necessary to ensure that early breakdowns do not occur , and that an acceptable inter - electrode insulation is maintained throughout the detector lifetime .",
    "thus a careful tuning of the p@xmath15 implant is necessary . a hybrid solution that aims at bridging the advantages of the two methods , the so - called `` moderated p - spray '' is sometimes used .",
    "this solution requires an additional mask , but may ease the conflicting constraints of avoiding early breakdowns and maintaining high interstrip resistance at all the radiation levels .",
    "note that due to the lower hole mobility , the depletion voltage is three times higher for p - type substrates than n - type substrates of a given resistivity .",
    "the high energy physics community has decades of experience with detector grade n - type substrates , while the p - type option is relatively new .",
    "however , several groups are studying this technology .",
    "both the cern rd50 collaboration@xcite and the infn funded smarts collaboration @xcite have devoted considerable resources towards a comprehensive study of the properties of a variety of sensors implemented with this technology .",
    "sensors have been produced at research laboratories such as cnm - imb @xcite , or itc - irst @xcite , as well as at industrial foundries such as micron @xcite , and hamamatsu @xcite .",
    "thus a thorough understanding of the properties of these devices at different level of radiation is emerging .",
    "both diffusion oxygenated float zone ( dofz ) , and magnetic czochralski ( mcz ) si wafers have been used , with a wide resistivity range and wafer thicknesses typically between 200 @xmath16 m and 300 @xmath16 m .",
    "different isolation techniques have been used .",
    "the vast majority of the efforts has been concentrated on blanket p - spray , but different p - stop topologies , including field plate modifications @xcite , and moderated p - spray have been implemented .",
    "earlier wafers contained a large number of test structures , such as multi - guard ring diodes , mos capacitors , and gated diodes , and a smaller number of strip or pixel detectors .",
    "now the effort is progressing towards implementation of larger scale devices .",
    "for example , the rd50 collaboration has a set of devices being manufactured at micron on 6 inch wafers that include strip and pixel detectors suitable for lhcb , atlas , and cms upgrades .",
    "in addition , full size velo sensors on high resistivity p - type substrates have been produced , that have been assembled into fully instrumented modules by the university of liverpool group .",
    "there is a vast array of studies on the performance before and after irradiation of the detectors implemented on p - type substrates .",
    "some examples illustrating the achievements and challenges in this process will be discussed .",
    "blanket p - spray isolation with lower implant dose @xcite has been shown to fail to provide adequate interstrip resistance at a dose of about 50 mrad , which is the total dose expected in the middle region of the future upgrade of the atlas detector at super - lhc .",
    "a kek group @xcite reported similar findings for lower dose p - spray and p - stop implants .",
    "this group is investigating alternative isolation techniques to achieve the optimum interstrip resistance , including the use of field plates over the blocking implant .",
    "other operational aspects that need to be studied as a function of the radiation dose are the current versus voltage characteristic and the charge collection efficiency .",
    "it has been argued effectively @xcite that the latter parameter is a much better predictor of the longevity of any given detector technology than the full depletion voltage @xmath17 extracted from a capacitance versus voltage measurement . while @xmath17 may be not practically achievable because it would induce thermal runaway in radiation damaged sensors , adequate charge collection efficiency at lower voltages may be still be achieved .",
    "figure  [ lhcb : cc ] shows an example of the charge collection efficiency obtained in a 1x1 @xmath13 280 @xmath16 m thick microstrip detector produced by cnm - imb using masks designed at the university of liverpool .",
    "the charge collection measurement has been performed using a @xmath18ru source , that has an energy deposition comparable to a minimum ionizing particles .",
    "thus the study provides an absolute charge collection efficiency .",
    "as the noise has been shown not to depend upon the irradiation level , the signal to noise ratio scales with the charge signal , and , although it is deteriorating as a function of the radiation dose , may still be acceptable at the highest levels of radiation considered .",
    "p@xmath1 is a standard p - type substrate , while the others are oxygen enriched .",
    "the measurements @xcite have been performed at a temperature of -20/25@xmath19c.[lhcb : cc],width=377 ]    -4 cm    other radiation studies have been reported @xcite .",
    "one of the most recent is based on the measurements by a group at ific , valencia , @xcite of 4 microstrip detectors manufactured by cnm - imb and irradiated with neutrons at the triga mark ii reactor in ljubljana to different fluences ranging from 10@xmath20 to 10@xmath21 n/@xmath13 .",
    "figure  [ fig : iv ] shows the current versus voltage characteristic of irradiated sensors maintained at a temperature of -30@xmath19 c ; a non irradiated sensor is included for reference .",
    "earlier micro - discharges appear at lower irradiation doses .",
    "this group investigated the charge collection properties by measuring the charged signal induced by a pulsed infrared laser ( 1060 nm ) . at the higher fluences the charge collection efficiency",
    "does not reach the plateau corresponding to full depletion , and microdischarges onset was observed .",
    "c. [ fig : iv],width=453 ]    -6 cm    first examples of the feasibility of these detectors in real scale devices have been accomplished .",
    "for example , 6x6 @xmath13 silicon strip devices designed with atlas strip detector geometry implemented with n@xmath15 strips implanted on different substrates have been constructed and tested @xcite .",
    "the lhcb - velo group has produced full scale sensors on 300 @xmath16 m thickness high resistivity p - type substrates : the depletion voltage is of the order of 100 v , while breakdown is observed at a voltage exceeding 200 v. a fully instrumented velo module was tested in the laboratory both at the university of liverpool and cern , and was used in a recent test beam run including 10 velo modules .",
    "another large scale production of large microstrip and pixel modules on 6 \" wafers is under way at micron , with masks developed by the rd50 collaboration .",
    "the velo beam test data and laboratory and test beam characterization of the rd50 devices , before and after irradiation , will further our understanding of the operational and system properties of detectors built with this technology .",
    "the examples shown in this paper give some snapshots of the vibrant r&d effort to optimize processes based on p - type substrates to implement micropattern detectors .",
    "the ongoing research is making significant strides towards the development of a cost effective technology suitable for the highest radiation doses expected at slhc .",
