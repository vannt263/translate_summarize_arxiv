    "( hartman et al . 1999 ) is one of a number of `` unidentified '' egret sources at low galactic latitude , @xmath10 , for which a pulsar origin is the hypothesis favored by many authors ( e.g. , halpern & ruderman 1993 ; kaaret & cottam 1996 ; yadigaroglu & romani 1997 ) . emission attributed to this source was also detected by comptel ( iyudin et al .",
    "1997 ) , and probably by _ cos b _ ( wills et al . 1980 ) .",
    "we recently presented an x - ray , radio , and optical study of the error circle of  that revealed only one plausible candidate , a highly polarized , flat - spectrum radio shell superposed on a compact , non - thermal x - ray source with power - law photon index @xmath11 and with no obvious optical counterpart ( halpern et al .",
    "2001 , hereafter paper  i ) .",
    "we concluded that the most likely interpretation was a young pulsar and associated wind nebula ( pwn ) .",
    "the distance was estimated as 3  kpc from the x - ray absorption column density of @xmath12  @xmath13 . at that distance , the spin - down luminosity required to power the x - ray and @xmath9-ray luminosities of @xmath14 and @xmath15 ergs  s@xmath1 , respectively , would be similar to that of the younger known egret pulsars . in this letter ,",
    "we report follow - up observations that confirm a pulsar origin for .",
    "we observed the x - ray source  for 17,728  s on 2001 february 14 with the _ chandra _ imaging ccd array acis ",
    "the target was offset by @xmath16 from the default acis ",
    "i pointing position in each direction in order to avoid the inter - ccd gaps .",
    "a point source was clearly detected , surrounded by diffuse emission with a centrally peaked morphology ( figure  1 ) .",
    "there is evidently an arc of emission that resembles similar structures in the vela nebula ( helfand , gotthelf , & halpern 2001 ) , surrounded by fainter diffuse emission that is largely confined within the boundaries of the radio shell , which has a radius of @xmath17 .",
    "the radial profile of the x - ray flux is shown in figure  2 .",
    "the central point source accounts for @xmath18 of the total flux within @xmath19 .",
    "the total 210  kev flux is @xmath20  ergs  @xmath13  s@xmath1 , only slightly smaller than the value of @xmath21  ergs  @xmath13  s@xmath1 that we found in paper  i using .",
    "it is possible that the  gis , with its large point - spread function , encompassed some extended diffuse emission that is not easily recovered in this short _ chandra _ observation . in combination with the non - thermal spectrum of the x - ray nebula",
    ", the morphology indicates a `` composite '' supernova remnant ( to which    we assign the name g106.6 + 2.9 ) , although the radio shell is probably a shock between the pwn and the surrounding medium rather than a supernova blast wave ( see  6 ) .",
    "no thermal emission has yet been detected from this remnant at x - ray or optical wavelengths .",
    "there are eight x - ray sources in the acis image that can be immediately identified by inspection with bright stars on the palomar observatory sky survey .",
    "two of these are present on our optical ccd images of the field that were discussed in paper  i. we used them to derive a correction of @xmath22 to the x - ray aspect solution , obtaining the precise position for the point source listed in table  1 , with an estimated uncertainty radius of @xmath23 .",
    "the position of  was observed with the 76 m lovell radio telescope at jodrell bank on 2001 february 27 and 28 for 1.5 and 2.4hr , respectively .",
    "the observations used a cryogenic receiver at a central frequency of 1412mhz and a filter bank spectrometer with 64 channels , each 1mhz wide , for each of two orthogonal polarizations .",
    "after square - law detection and summing of complementary polarizations , the total - power levels in each of 64 channels were integrated every 1ms , 1-bit digitized , and written to tape for off - line analysis .",
    "standard search algorithms detected an unmistakable pulsed signal at a barycenter - corrected period @xmath24  ms and dispersion measure dm @xmath25 @xmath26  pc with signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of 13.9 and 18.6 on february 27 and 28 , respectively .",
    "these s / n values are consistent with each other after scaling for the relative integration times , suggesting that the pulsar does not scintillate markedly . based on this and the known telescope sensitivity",
    ", we estimate that the period - averaged flux density of the pulsar at this frequency is 0.25mjy , with @xmath27 uncertainty .",
    "this is a rather low value , fully consistent with its non - detection in previous `` all - sky '' surveys , and with the median rms of 0.12mjy reported for the vla image in paper  i. the radio pulse profile ( figure 3 ) consists of one featureless peak with full - width at half - maximum of @xmath28 cycles .",
    "we began regular timing observations of this source , and a phase - connected solution to times - of - arrival spanning 11 days in 2001 march yields the period listed in table  1 , and @xmath29 s  s@xmath1 .",
    "the more accurate @xmath3    listed in table  1 is derived from a fit to this period in 2001 march and the period subsequently found in the x - ray data obtained 1.6 yr earlier (  4 ) . thus far",
    ", our data do not meaningfully constrain the amount of timing noise or glitch activity that may be present in .",
    "if we assume a distance of 3  kpc as estimated from the x - ray spectrum in paper  i , the free electron / distance model of taylor & cordes  ( 1993 ) would predict dm @xmath30 @xmath26  pc , significantly less than the observed dm @xmath31 .",
    "conversely , for the observed dm the model predicts a distance of 12  kpc .",
    "it is known that for individual objects the model distances / dms can be wrong by a factor of a few , and this may be the case for .",
    "in fact , the rule of thumb of 0.1 free electrons per hydrogen atom , combined with the measured dm , yields a predicted @xmath32@xmath13 , in exact agreement with the x - ray measured value from the  spectrum . while the conversion from column density to distance is itself uncertain , we tentatively retain the previous `` x - ray '' estimate of @xmath33  kpc , while acknowledging that considerable uncertainty remains .",
    "following the radio pulsar discovery in 2001 february , we searched the 113,700 s of  gis data obtained on 1999 august 47 for pulsations at periods slightly shorter than the radio , incorporating in the folding the @xmath3 that would be necessary to connect to the radio period obtained 1.6  yr later . using the @xmath34 test ( buccheri et al . 1983 ) to gain sensitivity to @xmath35 harmonics of the fundamental period , we found an unambiguous signal with @xmath36 at @xmath37  ms ( mjd 51394.365 ) , requiring @xmath38  s  s@xmath1 to connect to the radio ephemeris .",
    "the @xmath34 statistic is distributed as @xmath39 with @xmath40 degrees of freedom .",
    "the probability of a spurious detection is @xmath41 per trial , while only @xmath42 independent trial periods were searched .",
    "figure 4 shows the folded light curve in the 0.810 kev band , extracted from a region of radius @xmath43 around the source .",
    "there are evidently two pulses approximately @xmath44 apart in phase , although they are not symmetric .",
    "the rise time of the higher pulse is unresolved ; the bin size in figure  4 ( 2.55  ms ) is comparable to the instrumental time resolution .",
    "( approximately half the data were obtained with 0.5  ms resolution , and half with 3.9  ms resolution . )",
    "since most of the extracted flux is diffuse , it is not possible to measure the true pulsed fraction accurately . after subtracting background from an annulus surrounding the nebula",
    ", the  gis light curve has a pulsed fraction of 22% , but since the _ chandra _ image indicates that only 29% of these photons are from the pulsar , the true pulsed fraction must be at least 75% .",
    "optical images of the location of  from the mdm 2.4 m telescope were shown in figure  3 of paper  i. the precise _ chandra _ position of is now seen to fall only @xmath22 north of the @xmath45 star marked a in that figure , and a similar distance south of a fainter star of @xmath46 . given the uncertainty of only @xmath23 , the x - ray position is inconsistent with either of these stars . star a is , in fact , a highly reddened a star as we determined using the kpno 2.1 m telescope and goldam    spectrograph . the proximity to this bright star will make any further optical search for the pulsar difficult from the ground . although our images reach a limiting magnitude of @xmath47 in good seeing , a more conservative limit of @xmath48 probably applies at the location of the pulsar in the wings of the bright star .",
    "applying the standard magnetic dipole model for rotation powered pulsars , we can use the measured @xmath2 and @xmath3 of  to derive the spin - down power @xmath49 ergs  s@xmath1 , the magnetic field @xmath50  g , and the characteristic age @xmath51  yr .",
    "compared to known @xmath9-ray pulsars  is second only to the crab in spin - down power , and it is significantly more luminous than the vela pulsar ( psr b083345 ) , which has @xmath52 erg  s@xmath1 . for a distance of 3  kpc estimated from x - ray absorption and radio pulse dispersion ,",
    "the ratio of total 210 kev x - ray luminosity to spin - down power is @xmath7 , smaller than that of most pulsars , but similar to vela ( helfand et al .",
    "if  is the counterpart of , then its luminosity above 100  mev is @xmath53 ergs  s@xmath1 , and its efficiency of gamma - ray production , if isotropic , is @xmath8 . for vela",
    ", the same analysis gives a @xmath9-ray efficiency of @xmath54 .    among the pulsars that are",
    "either reliably or probably identified with egret sources , there is a trend ( thompson et al .",
    "1997 , 1999 ) in which the efficiency of @xmath55  mev @xmath9-ray production increases with decreasing spin - down power ( @xmath56 ) , or equivalently , open field line voltage ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "their efficiencies range from 0.002 for the crab , to of order unity for the middle - aged pulsars geminga and psr  b105552 . as the source of",
    ",  would have an efficiency in accord with the established pattern if its distance were close to our estimate of 3  kpc .",
    "if , on the other hand , the distance were as large as the dm estimate of 12 kpc ,  would have to be more efficient than either the crab or vela , but not so much more as to rule it out as the source of . while  is apparently similar to the vela pulsar in @xmath9-ray luminosity , its @xmath9-ray spectrum is characterized as a power - law of photon index @xmath58 ( hartman et al .",
    "this is steep compared to vela and all other egret pulsars except the crab , for which @xmath59 .",
    "the x - ray pulse profile of  is also reminiscent of that of the crab , with its two unequal peaks .",
    "iyudin et al .",
    "( 1997 ) reported the detection of a source in the 0.753  mev band with comptel , coincident with  but with a much larger error box .",
    "this detection is consistent in flux with an extrapolation of the egret spectrum , but it would exceed an extrapolation of the 210 kev spectrum of  to 1  mev .",
    "the soft gamma - ray emission in this region therefore deserves more detailed study",
    ".  may be one of the brightest pulsars at 1  mev .",
    "as a supernova remnant , g106.6 + 2.9 still has the peculiar property in the radio of shell morphology , but with an extremely flat radio spectrum ( @xmath60 , paper  i ) . since the x - ray emission appears to be largely confined within the radio shell , and since the shell is too small to be the blast wave of a @xmath61 year old supernova remnant , we conclude as was proposed in paper  i that the radio emission comes from a shock driven into the surrounding medium either by the motion of the pulsar or by the expansion of the pwn . in the bow - shock interpretation",
    ", we can relate the now known spin - down power , @xmath62 ergs  s@xmath1 assumed to be carried almost entirely by the pwn , to the velocity of the pulsar @xmath63 , the ambient density @xmath64 , and the radius of the shock @xmath65 via @xmath66 .",
    "thus @xmath67 we measured @xmath68 for @xmath65 , and we assume a relatively low - density medium , as might be appropriate at a @xmath69-height of 150  pc or in a cavity previously evacuated by a supernova explosion .",
    "however , the production of the particle energy spectrum needed to explain the flat radio spectrum is still not understood theoretically .",
    "we have discovered the likely source of the @xmath9-rays from , a young and energetic 51.6  ms pulsar that has properties in accord with those of known @xmath9-ray pulsars .",
    "it may be possible to prove the association by finding the corresponding pulsed signal in the egret @xmath9-ray photons .",
    "it is unlikely , however , that the ephemeris of such a young pulsar is stable enough to extrapolate back with phase coherence to the several epochs of egret exposure on this source .",
    "while we have ongoing radio and x - ray observations scheduled to assist in this analysis , considerable searching of parameter space will undoubtedly be necessary .",
    "future observations with _",
    "glast _ can definitively test the identification , and can provide an excellent pulse profile for comparison with the x - ray and radio .",
    "even so , it is important to realize that since , as described in paper  i , we have already made a sensitive search of the entire error circle of  without finding any plausible alternative x - ray counterpart to much fainter limits , it is more conservative to accept the identification with  than to doubt it .",
    "the only other object that we are aware has been considered for identification with is a be star / x - ray binary with an unknown rotation period ( sax  j2239.3 + 6116 = 4u  2238 + 60 , in t zand et al .",
    "2000 ) , but since that x - ray source is @xmath70 from the @xmath9-ray centroid , or 3 times the 95% error radius , it is an unlikely candidate .",
    "meanwhile , /g106.6 + 2.9 is sure to become a well - observed example of a young pwn , more of which are needed to study the poorly understood processes of particle acceleration in pulsars , spin - down evolution , mhd flows in pwne , and interaction with the surrounding medium .",
