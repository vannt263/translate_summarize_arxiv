    "ternary compounds whose structures include a regular sublattice of magnetic moments are attractive objects for studying the influence of magnetism on superconductivity . among these materials ,",
    "the most famous are pbmo@xmath18s@xmath19-type `` chevrel phases '' and ternary rare - earth rhodium borides @xcite .",
    "the physical properties of quadruple compounds dy@xmath20y@xmath21rh@xmath6b@xmath6 having a body - centered tetragonal luru@xmath6b@xmath6-type crystal structure deserve special attention due to a great number of interesting features of these materials . for instance",
    ", it was found @xcite that the magnetic ordering of dy atoms may occur at the temperature @xmath22 higher than the superconducting transition temperature @xmath23 and coexist with superconductivity down to very low temperatures .",
    "it was established in @xcite that dy@xmath20y@xmath21rh@xmath6b@xmath6 belongs to materials with intrinsic ferrimagnetism , and the transition temperature @xmath22 strongly depends on the concentration of non - magnetic yttrium : it falls with increasing y concentration from 37 k in dyrh@xmath6b@xmath6 down to 7 k in dy@xmath24y@xmath25rh@xmath6b@xmath6 . on the contrary",
    ", @xmath23 increases with the y concentration from 4.7 k for dyrh@xmath6b@xmath6 to 10.5 k in yrh@xmath6b@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "measurements of the specific heat of dy@xmath25y@xmath24rh@xmath6b@xmath6 ( @xmath26 k , @xmath27 k ) indicate emergence of another magnetic phase transition below 2.7 k @xcite .",
    "recently , anomalies of some physical quantities , unusual for systems with conventional superconductivity , were discovered in dy@xmath20y@xmath21rh@xmath6b@xmath6 : the paramagnetic meissner effect @xcite and non - monotonic temperature dependencies of the upper critical magnetic field @xmath1 and the superconducting gap @xcite .",
    "another specific feature of this class of magnetic superconductors is the change of the type of magnetic interactions in the dy subsystem under partial replacement of rhodium by ruthenium .",
    "as shown in @xcite , antiferromagnetic ordering in dy(rh@xmath28ru@xmath29)@xmath6b@xmath6 holds for @xmath30 and changes to a ferromagnetic one for @xmath31 .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature also varies with the ru concentration @xcite .",
    "thus , the study of physical properties of the borides family dy@xmath20y@xmath21(rh , ru)@xmath6b@xmath6 with various content of dysprosium ( responsible for the magnetic interactions ) and of ruthenium and rhodium ( responsible for both the magnetic interactions and superconductivity ) is of great interest to explore the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism and the possibility of appearance of unconventional superconductivity . for this purpose",
    ", we studied in this paper the behavior of the electric resistance in the vicinity of the superconducting transition and the upper critical field in the compound dy@xmath2y@xmath3rh@xmath4ru@xmath5b@xmath6 at different orientations of external magnetic field with respect to the direction of measuring electric current .",
    "the dy@xmath2y@xmath3rh@xmath4ru@xmath5b@xmath6 compound has been prepared by the argon arc melting of initial components , followed by annealing within a few days .",
    "the resulting single - phase polycrystalline ingot had a luru@xmath6b@xmath6-type crystal structure ( space group i4/mmm ) testified by the x - ray phase and structural analyses . at this concentration of ruthenium , it is possible to synthesize samples with such structure at the normal pressure , in contrast to the quadruple compounds dy@xmath20y@xmath21rh@xmath6b@xmath6 , which gain the required structure only during the synthesis under a pressure of 8 gpa .",
    "the samples were cut from the ingot in the form of parallelepipeds whose lengths were about 6 mm and the cross - sectional area was @xmath32 mm .",
    "the measurements of the electrical resistance @xmath8 of the samples were performed on a quantum design ppms-9 automatic system using a standard four - probe circuit with an alternating current ( @xmath33 ma , @xmath34 hz ) in the temperature range @xmath35 k and magnetic fields up to 36 koe produced by a superconducting solenoid .",
    "the sample holder was equipped with a system for automatic rotation of the substrate with the sample by a stepping motor of high resolution which allowed the measurement of @xmath8 for different angles @xmath7 of inclination of the external magnetic field @xmath36 to the direction of the current .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature measured in the middle of the resistive transition in zero magnetic field was @xmath37 k.    fig.[fig1 ] presents the temperature dependencies of the sample resistance in different magnetic fields of three orientations : @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath12 ( panels ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively ) .",
    "for the angles @xmath11 and @xmath39 , the experiments were made in magnetic fields @xmath40 koe and for @xmath41  at @xmath42 koe .",
    "the shape of @xmath8 in the range of fields @xmath43 koe is typical for the superconducting transition : a sharp fall of the resistance below a certain temperature followed by its disappearance at lower temperatures .",
    "another type of the behavior of @xmath8 was observed at @xmath14 in the fields larger than 6 koe . in this case , the resistance decreases only down to a certain finite value @xmath44 ( @xmath45 is the sample resistance of in the normal state ) , and then , as the temperature is lowered further , @xmath8 rapidly increases . with further increase of the field , the observed minimum of @xmath8 shifts to lower temperatures and reduces in its depth up to @xmath46 . thus it can be argued that the destruction of superconductivity at the magnetic field orientation @xmath14 ( fig.[fig1]b ) begins in the fields much smaller than at the orientations @xmath38 and @xmath12 .",
    "such strong anisotropy of @xmath8 is apparently due to the presence of the texture ( preferred orientation of individual crystallites ) in a polycrystalline sample and the coexistence of the magnetic and superconducting orderings . along this line of reasonings",
    ", the minimum in @xmath8 for @xmath14 can be attributed to stronger ( compared to other orientations ) enhancement of an uncompensated magnetic moment with increasing magnetic field .",
    "this excess magnetism leads to significant suppression of the superconducting state in the fields @xmath47 koe at @xmath14 , while for other orientations , superconductivity holds up to several tens of koe .",
    "= 8.5 cm    = 8.5 cm    we note that a minimum of @xmath8 in magnetic fields has been earlier observed in other magnetic superconductors such as ndrh@xmath6b@xmath6 @xcite and dy@xmath48mo@xmath18s@xmath19 @xcite .",
    "it has been attributed to the induction of the magnetic ordering of nd and dy ions by an external magnetic field at the transition temperature @xmath49 , which leads to destruction of the superconducting state ( reentrant superconductivity ) . however , in our case , the superconductivity and the magnetic order , which emerges at @xmath50 , coexist below @xmath23 , and the minimum in @xmath8 can be explained as the result of changes in the existing magnetic structure caused by the magnetic field of specific orientation .    using the data of fig.[fig1 ] and accepting for @xmath9 the values of the external magnetic field and the temperature , at which @xmath51 , we plotted the experimental temperature dependencies of the upper critical field depicted by circles and squares in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "in contrast to the previous andreev spectroscopy data @xcite , we did not found any non - monotony in the behavior of @xmath9 that possibly reflects certain ambiguity in the interpretation of the results of the point - contact measurements in nonhomogeneous samples ; a certain role in this difference may be also played by the admixture of ruthenium in our samples . dashed curves in fig.[fig1 ]",
    "show the dependencies @xmath9 calculated from the equation of the werthamer - gelfand - hohenberg ( whh ) theory @xcite : @xmath52 here @xmath53 is the digamma function , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 are the reduced temperature and critical magnetic field , respectively . in our calculations",
    ", we use the fitting values of the maki parameter @xmath10 which describes relative contribution of the spin - paramagnetic effect and the parameter @xmath56 of the spin - orbit scattering . the best fit for @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    "gives @xmath57 , i.e. , only the orbital effect is responsible for the suppression of superconductivity , whereas at @xmath14 we obtain a rather large value of @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) which indicates essential contribution of the spin - paramagnetic effect .",
    "figure 2 shows that for @xmath60 , the experimental values of @xmath9 at the temperatures below @xmath61 slightly exceed the maximum possible calculated ones .",
    "this could be explained either by the effect of anisotropy ( may lead to increase in @xmath1 by @xmath62 @xcite ) or by the presence of strong coupling in the superconducting condensate ( can enhance @xmath1 by @xmath63 times @xcite ) , which are beyond the frameworks of the whh theory .",
    "the possibility of the strong coupling in this material follows from the results of the andreev spectroscopy of the superconducting gap @xmath64 @xcite , according to which the ratio @xmath65 can reach 4 or even higher values , larger than the value 3.52 for conventional superconductors with the weak coupling .",
    "the orbital critical field at @xmath66 can be calculated by using the formula of the whh theory for the dirty limit @xcite , @xmath67 while the upper critical field can be estimated as @xcite @xmath68 as is obvious from fig.[fig2 ] , initial slopes of @xmath9 near @xmath23 are approximately equal for all orientations of the magnetic field . according to , this results in a universal ( angle - independent ) value of @xmath69 koe . since at @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    "the fitting value of the maki parameter is close to zero , we conclude that the orbital field at these orientations fully determines the magnitude @xmath70 of the upper critical field at zero temperature .",
    "the estimate of a small paramagnetic contribution can be obtained from the relation @xmath71 for the chandrasekhar - clogston limit @xcite ( @xmath72 is the bohr s magneton ) which gives the critical paramagnetic field @xmath73 koe .",
    "then , using the equation @xcite @xmath74 we found a rather small value @xmath75 for the maki parameter which explains unobservability of the spin effects at the experimental dependencies @xmath9 at @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "as noted above , at @xmath14 , the large value of the maki parameter @xmath15 implies that the spin - paramagnetic effect plays the main role in the suppression of superconductivity . in this case",
    ", equation gives @xmath76 koe , i.e. , by 4.3 times smaller than its value for the orientations @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "correspondingly , the magnitude of the critical paramagnetic field @xmath77 koe found from appears to be much smaller than at @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "these results give additional arguments in the benefit of our assumption about rearrangement of the magnetic structure and formation of an excess magnetic moment induced by the external magnetic field .",
    "this considerably enhances the effective magnetic field acting on the electron spins which causes destruction of the cooper pairs .",
    "= 8.5 cm    in order to obtain additional information about the effect of the magnetic field inclination on the suppression of superconductivity , we measured the angle dependencies of the sample resistance within the range @xmath78 ( see fig.[fig3 ] ) at the temperature @xmath79 k which corresponds to the middle of the superconducting transition at @xmath80 in the field of 8 koe . figure [ fig3 ] shows that with an increase in the angle , the resistance first grows to a maximum value @xmath45 at @xmath14 , then begins to drop with a minimum at @xmath81 .",
    "all highs in @xmath82 repeat themselves through @xmath12 , and lows  through @xmath83 ( the magnitude of minimum ohmic losses for @xmath11 and @xmath83 is smaller than that at @xmath81 and @xmath84 ) .",
    "thus , the superconductivity is most strongly suppressed in the magnetic fields directed at the angles @xmath39 plus multiple of @xmath12 relative to the longitudinal sample axis .",
    "the fields inclined at the angles by multiple of @xmath12 have the weakest impact on the superconducting state .",
    "the dashed line in fig.[fig3 ] indicates the experimental data obtained at @xmath85 k in the field of 8 koe and demonstrates independence of the sample resistance of the field direction in the normal state .",
    "we have measured the resistance @xmath0 and the upper critical magnetic field @xmath1 of the magnetic superconductor dy@xmath86y@xmath3rh@xmath4ru@xmath5b@xmath6 at different angles @xmath7 of inclination of the magnetic field relative to the longitudinal sample axis .",
    "the temperature dependencies @xmath8 and @xmath9 are strongly anisotropic in the superconducting state , whereas the rotation of the magnetic field in the normal state has no effect on its resistive properties . suppression of superconductivity is most pronounced at @xmath87 plus multiple of @xmath12 ( @xmath76 koe ) , while at the angles @xmath60 and @xmath12 the effect of the magnetic field on the superconducting state is weakest , and the calculated magnitude of @xmath16 reaches 38 koe .",
    "a minimum in @xmath8 in large enough fields was observed at @xmath87 which resembles reentrance effects in some magnetic superconductors near the point of transition to the magnetically ordered state .",
    "however , in our case , this minimum most likely occurs due to restructuring of already existed magnetic ordering .",
    "analysis of the behavior of @xmath9 within the framework of the whh theory shows that for @xmath11 and @xmath12 the maki parameter @xmath10 and the parameter @xmath56 of the spin - orbit scattering are close to zero , i.e. , only the orbital effect is responsible for the suppression of superconductivity .",
    "this is confirmed by the estimate of @xmath10 obtained from the calculated paramagnetic limit . on the contrary , at @xmath14 ,",
    "the maki parameter was found to be large ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) which manifests the dominating role of the spin - paramagnetic depairing mechanism .",
    "we suggest that the above mentioned features of the behavior of superconducting parameters may be associated with the growth of a spontaneous magnetic moment of the dysprosium subsystem induced by an external magnetic field of specified orientation . at the same time",
    ", one can not exclude the existence of an unconventional pairing mechanism , such as a triplet pairing , in this material .",
