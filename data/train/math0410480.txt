    "self - similar sets are often constructed as the invariant set of iterated function systems @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "many other examples , such as the inflation rule of the penrose tilings , show that a graph directed generalization of iterated function systems is also interesting and has been developed as mauldin - williams graphs @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "since we can regard graph directed iterated function systems as dynamical systems , we expect that there exist fruitful connections between mauldin - williams graphs and @xmath2-algebras .    in @xcite",
    "the first - named author defined a @xmath2-correspondence @xmath5 for a mauldin - williams graph @xmath0 and showed that the cuntz - pimsner algebra @xmath6 ( see @xcite , @xcite ) is isomorphic to the cuntz - krieger algebra @xmath7 ( @xcite ) associated with the underlying graph @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , if the mauldin - williams graph has one vertex and @xmath8 edges , the cuntz - pimsner algebra @xmath6 is isomorphic to the cuntz algebra @xmath9 ( @xcite ) , which recovers a result in @xcite .",
    "the construction is useful because it gives many examples of different non - self - adjoint algebras which are not completely isometrically isomorphic , but have the same @xmath2-envelope ( @xcite ) as shown by the first - named author in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , kajiwara and the second - named author introduced @xmath2-algebras associated with rational functions in @xcite including the singular points ( i.e. branched points ) .",
    "they developed the idea to associate @xmath2-algebras with self - similar sets considering the singular points in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we associate another @xmath2-algebra @xmath3 with a mauldin - williams graph @xmath0 and its invariant set @xmath1 putting emphasis on the singular points as above .",
    "we show that the associated @xmath2-algebra @xmath3 is not isomorphic to the cuntz - krieger algebra @xmath7 for the underlying graph @xmath4 in general .",
    "this comes from the fact that the singular points cause the failure of the injectivity of the coding by the markov shift for @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that the underlying graph g has no sinks and no sources .",
    "we show that the associated @xmath2-algebra @xmath3 is simple and purely infinite if @xmath0 satisfies the open set condition in @xmath1 and if @xmath4 is irreducible and is not a cyclic permutation .",
    "we calculate the @xmath1-groups for some examples including the inflation rule of the penrose tilings .",
    "the @xmath2-algebras associated with tilings were first studied by connes in @xcite and also discussed by mingo @xcite and anderson - putnam @xcite .",
    "but we do not know the exact relatition between their constructions and ours .    our construction has a common flavor with several topological generalizations of graph @xmath2-algebras @xcite by brenken @xcite , katsura @xcite , muhly and solel @xcite and muhly and tomforde @xcite .",
    "since graph directed iterated function systems are sometimes obtained as continuous cross sections of expanding maps , @xmath2-algebras associated with interval maps introduced by deaconu and shultz in @xcite are closely related with our construction . in a different point of view , bratteli and jorgensen studied a relation between iterated function systems and representation of cuntz algebras in @xcite .",
