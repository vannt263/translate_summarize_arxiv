    "additive manufacturing , or 3d printing , refers to a class of technology for the direct fabrication of physical products from 3d computer - aided design ( cad ) models .",
    "in contrast to material removal processes in traditional machining , the printing process adds material layer by layer .",
    "this enables direct printing of geometrically complex products without affecting building efficiency .",
    "no extra effort is necessary for molding construction or fixture tooling design , making 3d printing a promising manufacturing technique [ @xcite ] . despite these promising features , accurate control of a product s printed dimensions",
    "remains a major bottleneck .",
    "material solidification during layer formation leads to product deformation , or shrinkage [ @xcite ] , which reduces the utility of printed products . shrinkage control is crucial to overcome the accuracy barrier in 3d printing .",
    "to control detailed features along the boundary of a printed product , @xcite and @xcite used polynomial regression models to first analyze shrinkage in different directions separately , and then compensate for product deformation by changing the original cad accordingly .",
    "unfortunately , their predictions are independent of the product s geometry , which is not consistent with the physical manufacturing process . @xcite built on this work , establishing a generic , physically consistent approach to model and",
    "predict product deformations , and to derive compensation plans .",
    "the essence of this new modeling approach is to transform in - plane geometric errors from the cartesian coordinate system into a functional profile defined on the polar coordinate system .",
    "this representation decouples the geometric shape complexity from the deformation modeling , and a generic formulation of shape deformation can thus be achieved .",
    "the approach was developed for a stereolithography process , and in experiments achieved an improvement of one order of magnitude in reduction of deformation for cylinder products .",
    "however , an important issue not yet addressed in the previously cited work on deformation control for 3d printing is how the application of compensation to one section of a product will affect the deformation of its neighbors .",
    "compensation plans are always discretized according to the tolerance of the 3d printer , in the sense that sections of the cad are altered by single amounts , for example , as in figure  [ compensationexample ] . furthermore ,",
    "when planning an experiment to assess the effect of compensation on product deformation , it is natural to discretize the quantitative `` compensation '' factor into a finite number of levels , which also leads to a product having a more complex boundary",
    ". ultimately , such changes may introduce interference between different sections of the printed product , which is defined to occur when one section s deformation depends not only on its assigned compensation , but also on compensations assigned to its neighbors [ @xcite ] .",
    "for example , in figure  [ compensationexample ] , the deformation for points near the boundary of two neighboring sections should depend on compensations applied to both . by the same logic , interference becomes a practical issue when printing products with complex geometry .",
    "therefore , to improve quality control in 3d printing , it is important to formally investigate complications introduced by the interference that results from discretization in compensation plans .",
    "we take the first step with an experiment involving a discretized compensation plan for a simple shape .",
    "we begin in section  [ sec2 ] with a review of interference , models for product deformation , and the effect of compensation .",
    "adoption of the rubin causal model [ rcm , @xcite ] is a significant and novel feature of our investigation , and facilitates the study of interference .",
    "section  [ secnocompensationfit ] summarizes the basic model and analysis for deformation of cylinders given by @xcite .",
    "our analyses are in sections  [ secexperimentaldesign][secrefinedmodelinterference ] : we first describe an experiment hypothesized to generate interference , then proceed with posterior predictive checks to demonstrate the existence of interference , and finally conclude with a model that captures interference . a statistically substantial idea in section  [ secassessinginterference ]",
    "is that , in experiments with distinct units of analysis and units of interpretation [ @xcite , pages 1819 ] , the posterior distribution of model parameters , based on `` benchmark '' data , yields a simple assessment and inference for interference in the experiment , similar to that suggested by @xcite and @xcite",
    ". analyses in sections  [ secsimplemodelinterference][secrefinedmodelinterference ] demonstrate how discretized compensation plans complicate quality control through the of interference .",
    "this illustrates the fact that in complex manufacturing processes , a proper definition of experimental units and understanding of interference are critical to quality control .",
    "we use the generalframework for product deformation given by @xcite [ ( @xcite ) , pages 36 ] . suppose a product has intended shape @xmath0 and observed shape @xmath1 under a 3d printing process .",
    "deformation is informally described as the difference between @xmath1 and @xmath0 , where we can represent both either in the cartesian coordinate system @xmath2 or cylindrical coordinate system @xmath3 .",
    "cylindrical coordinates facilitate deformation modeling and are used throughout .    for illustrative purposes ,",
    "we define terms for two - dimensional products ( notation for three dimensions follows immediately ) .",
    "quality control requires an understanding of deformation in different regions of the product that receive different amounts of compensation .",
    "we therefore define a finite number @xmath4 of points on the boundary of the product , corresponding to specific angles @xmath5 , as the experimental units .",
    "the desired boundary from the cad model is defined by the function @xmath6 , denoting the nominal radius at angle @xmath7 .",
    "we consider only one ( quantitative ) treatment factor , compensation to the cad , defined as a change in the nominal radius of the cad by @xmath8 units at @xmath9 for @xmath10 .",
    "compensation is not restricted to be nonnegative .",
    "the potential radius for @xmath9 under compensation @xmath11 to @xmath5 is a function of @xmath9 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "the difference between the potential and nominal radius at @xmath9 defines deformation , and so @xmath15 is defined as our potential outcome for @xmath9 .",
    "potential outcomes are viewed as fixed numbers , with randomness introduced in section  [ secmodeling ] in our general model for the potential outcomes .",
    "this definition of the potential outcome is convenient for visualizing shrinkage .",
    "for example , suppose the desired shape of the product is the solid line , and the manufactured product when @xmath16 is the dashed line , in figure  [ deformationcurve](a ) .",
    "plotting the deformation at each angle yields a visualization amenable to analysis [ figure  [ deformationcurve](b ) ] .",
    "orientation is fixed : we match the coordinate axes of the printed product with those of the cad model .",
    "a unit @xmath9 is said to be affected by interference if @xmath17 for at least one pair of distinct treatment vectors @xmath18 with @xmath19 [ @xcite ] .",
    "if there is no interference , then @xmath20 is a function of @xmath13 only via the component @xmath8 . as the experimental units reside on a connected boundary",
    ", the deformation of one unit may depend on compensations assigned to its neighbors when the compensation plan is discretized .",
    "perhaps less plausible , but equally serious , is the possible leakage of assigned compensations across units .",
    "these considerations explain the presence of the vector @xmath13 , containing compensations for all units , in the potential outcome notation ( [ eqpotentialoutcomes ] ) .",
    "practically , accommodations made for interference should reduce bias in compensation plans for complex products and improve quality control .      following @xcite [ ( @xcite ) , pages 68 ] , our potential outcome model under compensation plan @xmath21 is decomposed into three components : @xmath22 function @xmath23 represents average deformation of a given nominal shape @xmath12 independent of location @xmath9 , and @xmath24 is the additional location - dependent deformation , geometrically and physically related to the cad model .",
    "we can also interpret @xmath25 as a low - order component and @xmath26 as a high - order component of deformation .",
    "the @xmath27 are random variables representing high - frequency components that add on to the main trend , with expectation @xmath28 and @xmath29 for all @xmath10 .    figure  [ deformationcurve ] demonstrates model ( [ eqdecomp1 ] ) . in this example , @xmath30 , so @xmath25 is a function of @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "decomposition of deformation into lower and higher order terms yields @xmath33 where @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are coefficients of a fourier series expansion of @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath37 terms with large @xmath38 represent the product s surface roughness , which is not of primary interest .      under the polar coordinate system",
    ", a compensation of @xmath8 units at @xmath9 can be thought of as an extension of the product s radius by @xmath8 units in that direction .",
    "bearing this in mind , we first follow @xcite [ ( @xcite ) , page 8 ] to extend ( [ eqdecomp1 ] ) to accommodate compensations , and then build upon this to give an extension that can help capture interference resulting from discretized compensation plans .",
    "let @xmath39 denote the potential radius for @xmath9 under compensation of @xmath8 units to all points .",
    "compensation @xmath40 is equivalent , in terms of the final manufactured product , as if a cad model with nominal radius @xmath41 and compensation @xmath42 was initially submitted to the 3d printer .",
    "then @xmath43 \\\\[-8pt ] \\nonumber & = & \\delta r\\bigl(\\theta_i , r_0(\\cdot ) + x_i , \\mathbf{0}\\bigr),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 follows the same form as ( [ eqdecomp1 ] ) , abbreviated as @xmath45 consequently , the potential outcome for @xmath9 is @xmath46 \\\\[-8pt ] & = & \\delta r\\bigl(\\theta_i , r_0(\\cdot ) + x_i , \\mathbf{0}\\bigr ) + x_i \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\mathbb{e } \\bigl\\ { \\delta r\\bigl(\\theta_i , r_0 ( \\cdot ) + x_i , \\mathbf{0}\\bigr ) \\bigr\\ } + x_i + \\varepsilon_i.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last two steps follow from ( [ eqintstep1 ] ) and ( [ eqintstep2 ] ) , respectively .",
    "if @xmath8 is small relative to @xmath47 , then ( [ eqmodelcomp2 ] ) can be approximated using the first and second terms of the taylor expansion of @xmath48 at @xmath47 : @xmath49_{x = 0 } + x_i + \\varepsilon _ { i } \\\\ & = & \\delta r\\bigl(\\theta_i , r_0(\\cdot),\\mathbf{0}\\bigr ) + \\bigl\\ { 1 + h\\bigl(\\theta_i , r_0(\\cdot ) , \\mathbf{0 } \\bigr)\\bigr\\ } x_i , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50_{x = 0}$ ] . under a specified parametric model for the potential outcomes ,",
    "this taylor expansion is performed conditional on the model parameters . when there is no interference , @xmath51 for any @xmath52 , and so ( [ eqcomptaylor ] ) is a model for compensation effects in this case .",
    "we can generalize this model to incorporate interference in a simple manner for a compensation plan @xmath13 with different units assigned different compensations .",
    "as all units are connected on the boundary of the product , unit @xmath9 s treatment effect will change due to interference from its neighbors , so that @xmath9 will deform not just according to its assigned compensation @xmath8 , but instead according to a compensation @xmath53 .",
    "thus , we generalize ( [ eqcomptaylor ] ) to @xmath54 where the _ effective treatment _ @xmath53 is a function of @xmath8 and assigned compensations for neighbors of @xmath9 ( with the definition of neighboring units naturally dependent on the specific product ) , hence potentially a function of the entire vector @xmath55 . allowing the treatment effect for @xmath9 to depend on treatments assigned to its neighboring units",
    "effectively incorporates interference in a meaningful manner , as will be seen in the analysis of our experiment .",
    "huang et  al . [ ( @xcite ) , page 12 ] constructed four cylinders with @xmath56 , and @xmath57 inches , and used @xmath58 , and @xmath59 equally - spaced units from each . based on the logic in section  [ secmodeling ] , they fitted @xmath60 to the data , with @xmath61 independently , and parameters @xmath62 , and @xmath63 independent of @xmath31 .",
    "specifically , for the cylinder , the location - independent term is thought to be proportional to @xmath31 , so that with overexposure of @xmath64 units it would be of the form @xmath65",
    ". furthermore , the location - dependent term is thought to be a harmonic function of @xmath9 , and also proportional to @xmath31 , of the form @xmath66 with overexposure .",
    "independent errors are used throughout because the focus is on a correct specification of the mean trend in deformation ( appendix  [ seccorrelation ] contains a discussion on this point ) .",
    "@xcite specified @xmath67 and placed flat priors on @xmath68 , and @xmath69 , with all parameters independent a priori .",
    "posterior draws of the parameters were obtained by hamiltonian monte carlo [ hmc , @xcite ] and are summarized in table  [ posteriorpredictivetable ] , with convergence diagnostics discussed in appendix  [ secdiagnostics ] .",
    "a simple comparison of the posterior predictive distribution of product deformation to the observed data [ @xcite , page 19 ] demonstrates the good fit , and so we proceed with this specification and parameter inferences to design and analyze an experiment for interference .",

    "we expect interference for angles near neighboring sections .",
    "interference should be substantial for a large difference in neighboring compensations , and negligible otherwise .",
    "this reasoning led to the following restricted latin square design to study interference .",
    "we apply compensations to four cylinders of radius @xmath84 , and @xmath57 inches , with each cylinder divided into @xmath85 equal - sized sections of @xmath86 radians .",
    "one unit of compensation is @xmath87 , and @xmath88 inch for each respective cylinder , and there are only four possible levels of compensation , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 units .",
    "two blocking factors are considered .",
    "the first is the quadrant and the second is the `` symmetry group '' consisting of @xmath86-radian sections that are reflections about the coordinate axes from each other .",
    "symmetric sections form a meaningful block : if compensation @xmath91 is applied to all units , then we have from ( [ eqmodelcompcylinder ] ) that for @xmath92 , @xmath93 suggesting a need to control for this symmetry in the experiment .",
    "thus , for each product , we conceive of the @xmath85 sections as a @xmath94 table , with symmetry groups forming the column blocking factor and quadrants the row blocking factor .",
    "based on prior concerns about the possible severity of interference and resulting scope of inference from our model ( [ eqcomptaylor ] ) , the set of possible designs was restricted to latin squares ( each compensation level occurs only once in any quadrant and symmetry group ) , where the absolute difference in assigned treatments between two neighboring sections does not exceed two levels of compensation . each product",
    "was randomly assigned one design from this set , with no further restriction that all the products have the same design .",
    "our restricted latin square design forms a discretized compensation plan that blocks on two factors suggested by the previous deformation model , and remains model - robust to a certain extent .",
    "the chosen experimental designs are in figure  [ design ] , and observed deformations for the manufactured products are in figure  [ experimentaldata ] .",
    "there are @xmath95 , and @xmath96 equally spaced angles considered for the four cylinders .              our first task is to assess which units have negligible interference in the experiment .",
    "to do so , we use the suggestions of @xcite and @xcite , who describe when interest exists in comparing a treatment assignment @xmath13 to a baseline .",
    "we have in section  [ secnocompensationfit ] data on cylinders that receive no compensation ( denoted by @xmath97 ) and a model ( [ eqnocompmodel ] ) that provides a good fit .",
    "furthermore , we have a hypothesized model ( [ eqmodelcompcylinder ] ) for compensation effects when interference is negligible , which is a function of parameters in ( [ eqnocompmodel ] ) .",
    "if the manufacturing process is in control , posterior inferences based on @xmath98 then yield , by ( [ eqmodelcompcylinder ] ) , predictions for the experiment . in the absence of any other information , units in the experiment with observed deformations deviating strongly from their predictions can be argued to have substantial interference .",
    "after all , if @xmath9 has negligible interference under assignment @xmath11 , then @xmath99 this suggests the following procedure to assess interference :    calculate the posterior distribution of the parameters conditional on @xmath97 , denoted by @xmath100 .    for every angle in the four cylinders , form the posterior predictive distribution of the potential outcome corresponding to the observed treatment assignment ( figure  [ design ] ) using model ( [ eqmodelcompcylinder ] ) and @xmath101 .",
    "compare the posterior predictive distributions to the observed deformations in the experiment .    *",
    "if a unit s observed outcome falls within the @xmath102 central posterior predictive interval and follows the posterior predictive mean trend , it is deemed to have negligible interference .",
    "* otherwise , we conclude that the unit has substantial interference .",
    "this procedure is similar to the construction of control charts [ @xcite ] .",
    "when an observed outcome lies outside the @xmath102 central posterior predictive interval , we suspect existence of a special cause . as the entire product is manufactured simultaneously , we believe that the only reasonable assignable cause is interference .",
    "we implemented this procedure and observed that approximately 70%80% of units , primarily in the central regions of sections , have negligible interference ( appendix  [ secposteriorpredictivecheck ] ) .",
    "this is clearly seen with another graph that assesses effective treatments , which we proceed to describe .",
    "taking expectations in ( [ eqmodelcompcylinder ] ) , the treatment effectively received by @xmath9 is @xmath103 we gauge @xmath53 by plugging observed data from the experiment and posterior draws of the parameters based on @xmath104 into ( [ eqtreatmentinterference ] ) .",
    "these discrepancy measure [ @xcite ] calculations , summarized in figure  [ posteriorpredictivetreatment ] , again suggest that central angles in each section have negligible interference : estimates of their effective treatments correspond to their assigned treatments .",
    "there is a slight discrepancy between assigned treatments and inferred effective treatments for some central angles , but this is likely due to different parameter values for the two data sets . of more importance",
    "is the observation that the effective treatment of a boundary angle @xmath9 is a weighted average of the treatment assigned to its section , @xmath105 , and its nearest neighboring section , @xmath106 , with the weights a function of the distances ( in radians ) between @xmath9 and the midpoint angle of its section , @xmath107 , and the midpoint angle of its nearest neighboring section , @xmath108 .",
    "all these observations correspond to the intuition that interference should be substantial near section boundaries .",
    "using ( [ eqtreatmentinterference ] ) .",
    "four horizontal lines in each subfigure denote the possible compensations , and dots denote estimates of treatments that units effectively received in the experiment . ]",
    "we first alter ( [ eqmodelcompcylinder ] ) to @xmath109 where @xmath110 \\\\[-8pt ] \\nonumber & & { } + \\bigl\\ { 1 + \\exp \\bigl ( \\lambda_{r_0 } |",

    "effective treatment @xmath53 is a weighted average of the unit s assigned treatment @xmath114 and the treatment @xmath106 assigned to its nearest neighboring section .",
    "although the form of the weights is chosen for computational convenience , we recognize that ( [ eqweightedtreatment ] ) belongs to a class of models agreeing with prior subject - matter knowledge that interference may be negligible if the implemented compensation plan is sufficiently `` continuous , '' in the sense that the theoretical compensation plan is a continuous function of @xmath7 and the tolerance of the 3d printer is sufficiently fine so that discretization of compensation is negligible ( appendix  [ secnote ] ) .",

    "the final ingredient is the explicit distinction between units of analysis and units of interpretation in our design , which provides the means to assess and model interference in the experiment .",
    "comparing observed outcomes from the experiment to posterior predictions allows one to infer the structure of interference , which can be validated by further experimentation .",
    "these considerations suggest that our methodology can be generalized and applied to other experimental situations with units residing on connected surfaces . in general , when experimenting with units on a connected surface , a principled and step - by - step analysis using the three ingredients above , as illustrated in this paper , can ultimately shed more light on the substantive question of interest .",
    "to manufacture 3d printed products satisfying dimensional accuracy demands , it is important to address the problem of interference in a principled manner .",
    "@xcite recognized that continuous compensation plans implemented on printers with a sufficiently fine tolerance can effectively control a product s printed dimensions without inducing additional complications through interference .",
    "their models for product deformation motivated our experiment that introduces interference through the application of a discretized compensation plan to the boundary of a cylinder . combining this experiment s data with inferences based on data for which every unit received no compensation led to an assessment of interference in terms of how units effective treatments differed from that physically assigned .",
    "further analyses effectively modeled interference in the experiment .",
    "it is important to note that the refined interference model s location and scale terms ( [ eqdeltafourierexpansion ] ) , ( [ eqlambdarefined ] ) are a function of the compensation plan .",
    "for example , reflecting the assigned compensations across the y axis would accordingly change the location shifts .",
    "the implication of this and all our previous observations for manufacturing is that severely discretized compensation plans introduce interference , and , if this fact is ignored , then quality control of 3d printed products will be hindered , especially for geometrically complex products relevant in real - life manufacturing .",
    "many research challenges and opportunities for both statistics and additive manufacturing remain to be addressed .",
    "perhaps the most important is experimental design in the presence of interference .",
    "for example , when focus is on the construction of specific classes of products ( e.g. , complicated gear structures ) , optimum designs can lead to precise estimates of model parameters , hence improved compensation plans and control of deformation .",
    "an important and subtle statistical issue that then arises is how the structure of interference changes as a function of the compensation plan derived from the experimental design .",
    "instead of being a weighted average of the treatment applied to its section and nearest neighboring section , the derived compensation plan may cause a unit s effective treatment to be a weighted average of treatments applied to other sections as well , with weights depending on the absolute difference in applied compensations .",
    "knowledge of the relationship between compensation plans derived from specific experimental designs and interference is necessary to improve quality control in general , and therefore is an important issue to address for 3d printing .",
    "in all our analyses , we assumed the @xmath151 were independent . as pointed out by a referee ,",
    "when units reside on a constrained boundary , independence of error terms is generally unrealistic .",
    "however , we believe that our specific context helps justify this simplifying assumption for several reasons .    first , the major objective driving our work on 3d printing is compensation for product deformation . to derive compensation plans ,",
    "it is important to accurately specify the mean trend in deformation .",
    "although incorporating correlation may change parameter estimates that govern the mean trend , we do not believe that modeling the correlation in errors will substantially help us compensate for printed product deformations .",
    "this is something we intend to address further in our future work .    . here",
    ", the residual is defined as the difference between the observed deformation and the posterior mean of deformation for each angle @xmath9 . ]    [ figresiduals ]    second , there is a factor that may further confound the potential benefits of including correlated errors in our model : the resolution of the cad model . to illustrate , consider the model fit in section  [ secnocompensationfit ] .",
    "we display the residual plots in figure  [ figresiduals ] .",
    "all residuals are ( in absolute value ) less than @xmath152 of the nominal radius for @xmath153 inch and at most approximately @xmath154 of the nominal radius for @xmath155 inches , supporting our claim that we have accurately modeled the mean trend in deformation for these products .",
    "however , we note that for @xmath155 inches , there is substantial negative correlation in residuals between adjacent units , with the residuals following a high - frequency harmonic trend .",
    "there is a simple explanation for this phenomenon .",
    "our first manufactured products were @xmath155 inches , and the cad models for these products had low resolution .",
    "low resolution in the cad model yields the high - frequency pattern in the residual plots .",
    "the next product we constructed was @xmath153 inch , and its cad model had higher resolution than that previously used , which helped to remove this high - frequency pattern .",
    "minor trends appear to exist in this particular plot , and an acf plot formally reveals significant autocorrelations .",
    "accordingly , we observe that the correlation in residuals is a function of the resolution of the initial cad model . in consideration of our current data and our primary objective to accurately capture the mean trend in deformation , we use independent @xmath151 throughout .",
    "we intend to pursue this issue further in our future work , for example , in the direction of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as pointed out by the associate editor , correlations in residuals for more complicated products may be accounted for by modeling the interference between units , which is precisely the focus of this manuscript .",
    "convergence of our mcmc algorithms was gauged by analysis of acf and trace plots , and effective sample size ( ess ) and @xcite [ ( @xcite ) , gr ] statistics , which were calculated using @xmath115 independent chains of @xmath117 draws after a burn - in of @xmath118 . in sections  [ secnocompensationfit ] and [ secsimplemodelinterference ] , the ess were all above @xmath156 ( the maximum is @xmath157 ) , and the gr statistics were all @xmath129 .",
    "the results of the first procedure described in section  [ secassessinginterference ] are displayed in figure  [ posteriorpredictiveexperiment ] : bold lines represent posterior means , dashed lines quantiles forming the 99% central posterior intervals , and dots the observed outcomes in the experiment , with separate figures for each nominal radius and compensation .",
    "for example , the graph in the first row and column of figure  [ posteriorpredictiveexperiment ] contains the observed data for angles in the @xmath128 inch radius cylinder that received @xmath1581 compensation .",
    "this figure also contains the posterior predictive mean and 99% intervals for all angles under the assumption that @xmath1581 compensation was applied uniformly to the cylinder .",
    "although only four sections of the cylinder received this compensation in the experiment , forming this distribution makes the posterior predictive mean trend transparent , and so helps identify when a unit s observed outcome deviates strongly from its prediction .    , and @xmath1592 compensation . ]    [ posteriorpredictiveexperiment ]",
    "compensation is applied in practice by discretizing the plan at a finite number of points , according to some tolerance specified by the size ( in radians ) for each section or , alternatively , the maximum value of @xmath160 .",
    "suppose compensation plan @xmath161 is a continuous function of @xmath7 , and define @xmath162 with @xmath163 a monotonically decreasing continuous function , and @xmath164 then for the cylinders considered in our experiment , @xmath165 as @xmath166 .",
    "this is because @xmath167 as @xmath168 , and @xmath169",
