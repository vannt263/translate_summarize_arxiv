    "nonequilibrium dynamics has been a topic of intensive research over the last few decades .",
    "the fact that models displaying identical equilibrium behaviour can be differentiated on the basis of critical relaxation , coarsening and persistence behaviour , has enhanced the interest in this field . traditionally critical and off critical",
    "dynamical behaviour were studied for magnetic systems with different dynamical rules and constraints @xcite .",
    "more recently , physicists have been able to construct dynamical models in problems which are interdisciplinary in nature , where one can investigate how such models can be classified into different dynamical classes .",
    "one very popular interdisciplinary topic is opinion dynamics , where a number of models @xcite have been proposed and studied by physicists , many of which can also be regarded as spin models .",
    "the dynamical rules in all the well studied opinion dynamics models with binary opinions ( @xmath0 ) in one dimension lead to the consensus state .",
    "the question whether the intrinsic dynamics for ordering are equivalent has been asked in context of the generalised @xmath1 state voter model @xcite , generalised glauber models @xcite and sznajd models @xcite .",
    "one of the quantities which is computed to resolve this important question is the exit probability ( ep ) which denotes the probability @xmath2 that one ends up in a configuration with all opinions equal to 1 starting from @xmath3 fraction of opinions equal to 1 .",
    "ep has been shown to be identical @xcite in the generalised glauber model and the sznajd model ; the latter was originally claimed to have a different dynamical scenario . in the voter model ( or ising glauber model ) in one dimension , @xmath2 is simply equal to @xmath3 , corresponding to the conservation in the dynamics @xcite . in the nonlinear voter model , long ranged sznajd model and long ranged glauber model ,",
    "it is a nonlinear continuous function of @xmath3 @xcite . in all these cases ,",
    "the results are also independent of finite system sizes indicating there is no scaling behaviour .",
    "the claim that the exit probability for sznajd model is a continuous function has been however questioned in @xcite .",
    "but analytical and numerical study of @xmath1 state nonlinear voter model ( sznajd model corresponds to nonlinear voter model with @xmath4 ) show that ep is a continuous function of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the mean field result was shown to be exact in the nonlinear @xmath1 voter model which includes the sznajd model and independent of the range @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in two dimensions or on networks , the exit probability shows a step function behaviour in many models which has been interpreted as a phase transition .",
    "@xmath2 also shows finite size dependence in that case @xcite .",
    "however , strictly speaking , one should interpret this as the existence of a separatrix between two different regions of basin of attraction - where the attractors are the states with all opinions equal to @xmath5 or @xmath6 .    in this paper",
    ", we have proposed a model ( the weighted influence model , wi model hereafter ) which shows completely different behaviour as the ep has a step function behaviour even in one dimension .",
    "the result also shows clear deviation from mean field theory , although the latter provides a reasonable first order estimate .",
    "the model includes one parameter which allows one to obtain a relevant `` phase diagram '' and also show the presence of universal behaviour .",
    "apart from studying the exit probability , we also investigate the dynamical behaviour of the wi model by studying the density of domain walls @xmath7 and persistence probability @xmath8 as functions of time @xmath9 starting from an initial disordered state .",
    "the latter is the probability that a spin has not flipped till time @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "it is known that in conventional coarsening processes , @xmath10 and @xmath8 shows a scaling behaviour @xmath11 in many systems @xcite where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the dynamic ( growth ) and persistence exponents respectively . by calculating @xmath12 and @xmath13 ,",
    "the dynamical class of the model can be identified and compared to models for which these exponents are known , for example , for the zero temperature ising model in one dimension , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are exactly known results .",
    "the rest of the paper is arranged as follows : sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] describes the model .",
    "[ sec3 ] discusses the mean field theory in the context of the present work .",
    "numerical results obtained from extensive simulations are presented in sec .",
    "dynamical properties of the model are given in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] and finally in sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] , concluding remarks are made .",
    "the wi model is a stochastic model with opinions taking values @xmath16 , and there is a bias towards one type of opinion controlled by a relative weight factor .",
    "it can not be true that an initial majority always wins ( in that case the same candidate / party will go on winning elections every time ) @xcite and a huge majority of people may give up to an initial minority view @xcite .",
    "the relative weight factor included in the model takes care of this idea .",
    "this weight factor represents the relative strength that may arise due to monetary factors , local factors , muscle power , larger accountability , traditional , religious or cultural influence , recent incidents which has a great impact on the population etc .",
    "the model is described in the following way .",
    "let there be two groups of people with opposing opinion in the immediate spatial neighbourhood of an individual . under the influence of these two groups ,",
    "she / he will be under pressure to follow one group .",
    "the pressure is proportional to the size of the group . denoting the two neighbouring opposing group sizes",
    "as @xmath17 and @xmath18 for opinion = @xmath0 respectively , an individual takes up opinion @xmath5 with probability @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the relative influencing ability of the two groups and can vary from zero to @xmath21 .",
    "probability to take opinion value @xmath6 is @xmath22 the model is considered in one dimension . in case",
    "an individual with opinion @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) has both nearest neighbours with opinion @xmath6 ( @xmath23 ) , her opinion will change deterministically .",
    "the unweighted model corresponds to @xmath24 @xcite .    in this model ,",
    "the dynamics is completely stochastic .",
    "a quasi - deterministic model in which the neighbouring domain sizes determine the state of a spin had been proposed earlier ( bs model hereafter ) @xcite .",
    "the bs model takes into consideration the sizes of neighbouring domains in the dynamics and the larger neighbouring domain always dictates the opinion , irrespective of its size . only in the case when the neighbouring domains are of equal size ( which occurs rarely ) is the dynamical rule stochastic . in the bs model , @xmath25 and @xmath26 (",
    "both the exponents are different from the ising model ) .",
    "we find some interesting effects of the nature of the stochasticity in the wi model , especially regarding the persistence behaviour , which is revealed when compared to the bs model and ising model dynamical results .    regarding the binary opinion values as ising spin states ( up / down ) , the absorbing states are the all up / all down states in the wi model .",
    "probability of attaining these consensus states however depends on the value of @xmath20 instead of being simply 1/2 ( as in the ising or voter model ) even when one starts from a completely random initial configuration ( @xmath27 ) . in the limit @xmath28",
    ", all spins will be up as @xmath29 for any initial value of @xmath3 while for @xmath30 , the final state will be all down for any value of @xmath31 .",
    "thus the threshold values @xmath32 for which the final state will be all up is zero for @xmath28 and 1 for @xmath30 .",
    "the exit probability is trivially a step function in these extreme limits .",
    "the question is what happens for other values of @xmath20 , including @xmath24 .",
    "the dynamics can be studied in terms of the motion of domain walls as only the spins adjacent to domain walls can flip . in a glauber like process",
    ", one considers the flipping of a random spin in time @xmath33 with the time unit being such that @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the total number of spins .",
    "initially , there will be many domains of size one , but they will quickly vanish as it is a deterministic process . assuming no domain of size one remains in the system and using a mean field approximation , one can write down a microscopic equation for the ( average ) fraction of up spins at time @xmath36 given that there was a fraction @xmath3 at @xmath9 . it may be noted that in this approximation , the fluctuations in the flipping probabilities @xmath37 and @xmath38 can be ignored and they can be taken to be site - independent .",
    "the equation for @xmath39 is then given by @xmath40 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + r(t ) [ ( x(t)+1/l)p_1 +   x(t)p_{-1 } ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & + ( 1 - 2r(t ) ) x(t).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath41 is the density of domain walls , @xmath42 when domains have length at least 2 .",
    "@xmath43 are also in general time dependent .",
    "the first two terms on the right hand side correspond to cases where the up and down spin at the boundary are chosen for flipping respectively while the last term is for the case when a spin within a domain is selected ( @xmath3 remains same in the last case obviously ) .",
    "thus one gets @xmath44 . \\label{fixed}\\ ] ] this equation can not be solved without knowing the dynamical equation for @xmath41 which is again expected to involve @xmath45 in a complicated manner .",
    "however , the fixed points of the equation , in which we are actually interested , are easily obtained ; a trivial fixed point @xmath46 and the other one is @xmath47 = 0 $ ] . for the ising or voter model",
    ", @xmath48 is equal to @xmath38 which corresponds to the result that @xmath49 independent of @xmath3 .",
    "this leads to the known result that the exit probability is simply equal to @xmath3 .",

    "gets a single fixed point @xmath32 from eq .",
    "( [ fixed ] ) , it will indicate the existence of the step function like behaviour associated with the exit probability .",
    "the mean field approximation of course neglects all correlations and fluctuations . in the wi model , @xmath38 and @xmath48 in mean field approximation",
    "can be estimated by taking @xmath50 and @xmath18 proportional to @xmath3 and @xmath51 respectively ( at the fixed point ) in eq .",
    "( [ prob1 ] ) .",
    "there is no reason to take the constant of proportionality to be different ( i.e. there is no bias to either type of domain ) such that @xmath52 $ ] and we get @xmath53    although the mean field result involves many assumptions it is tempting to accept this result as it coincides with the limiting results that @xmath54 for @xmath55 , @xmath56 for @xmath30 .",
    "the mean field result also predicts @xmath57 for @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath58 corresponds to the model with unweighted influence , and here if one starts with @xmath27 the system will go to @xmath23 state with @xmath59 probability ( by the argument of symmetry ) .",
    "if there is any initial bias ( @xmath60 ) in the system then it will win at the end .",
    "ep will be zero for @xmath61 and equal to 1 for @xmath62 .",
    "hence one expects that at @xmath58 , @xmath63 as given by ( [ eq - mf ] ) .",
    "having obtained the evidence of a single value of @xmath32 from mean field approximation , our next job is to find out numerically whether there exists a separatrix and and whether finite size effects exist .",
    "also , the deviation from mean field theory , if any , will be investigated in the following section .",
    "we calculate the exit probability @xmath64 for system sizes ranging from @xmath65 to @xmath66 and repeat the simulations for over at least @xmath67 configurations for each system size .",
    "@xmath64 against initial concentration @xmath3 is shown in fig .",
    "[ epvsups ] for two values of @xmath20 .",
    "it indeed shows a sharp rise close to a value of @xmath68 , henceforth called the separatrix point .",
    "the shape of the exit probability @xmath64 plotted against @xmath3 immediately shows that it is nonlinear , moreover , @xmath2 curves show strong system size dependence and intersect at a single point @xmath32 for different values of @xmath35 .",
    "the behaviour of ep indicates that it shows a step function behaviour in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "finite size scaling analysis can be made using the scaling form ( when @xmath20 is constant ) : @xmath69 where @xmath70 for @xmath71 and equal to 1 for @xmath72 ( i.e. , a step function in the thermodynamic limit ) .",
    "@xmath73 gives the the value of ep at the separatrix point .",
    "the data collapse , shown in fig .",
    "[ epvsups ] , takes place with @xmath74 for all values of @xmath20 .    for fixed @xmath3",
    ", the finite size scaling form for exit probability can be written as : @xmath75 where @xmath76 for @xmath72 , equal to 1 for @xmath71 .",
    "both the scaling forms ( eqs ( [ epscaling ] ) and ( [ delscaling ] ) ) give @xmath77 independent of the exact location of the separatrix point .",
    "@xmath32 as a function of @xmath20 denotes the trajectory of the separatrix point as @xmath20 is varied and for convenience we call it the `` phase boundary '' .",
    "so one can conclude that universal behaviour exists along the entire phase boundary .",
    "estimating @xmath32 for different values of @xmath20 , we plot the phase boundary in fig .",
    "[ delvsep ] .",
    "the phase boundary is not exactly given by the mean field estimate ( [ eq - mf ] ) but shows systematic deviation from this equation ( except at @xmath78 and @xmath30 ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ meanfield ] .",
    "there is a systematic difference from the mean field results away from @xmath79 which vanishes at @xmath80 and also as @xmath30 .",
    "however , the difference is mostly less than ten percent for other values of @xmath20 and therefore the mean field result can be taken as a first order estimate . in principle",
    ", one may consider an expression of @xmath32 given by a polynomial in @xmath81 as obviously it deviates from a simple linear form .",
    "however , introducing only a second order term is not sufficient and we therefore attempt to fit the numerically obtained values of @xmath32 accurately by a single correction term , the form of which is conjectured by the known values of @xmath32 at @xmath82 and @xmath30 .",
    "we assume the following form for @xmath32 : @xmath83 here @xmath84 in the correction term ( second term on right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eqcorec ] ) ) takes care that the term vanishes for @xmath85 .",
    "if one compares the numerical data with the mean field result ( fig .",
    "[ meanfield ] ) , the former gives larger values of @xmath32 for @xmath86 ( and lower values of @xmath32 for @xmath87 ) .",
    "so @xmath88 will be there in the correction term instead of @xmath89 .",
    "one also needs a factor proportional to a power of @xmath20 in the denominator of the correction term which should be nonzero for @xmath28 and make the term vanish in the limit @xmath30 .",
    "such a term is chosen as @xmath90 where @xmath91 should be greater than @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "we indeed find that eq .",
    "( [ eqcorec ] ) fits the curve quite nicely with @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "we also investigate the behaviour of @xmath73 @xmath96 @xmath97 as a function of @xmath20 ; although a monotonic increase is found , no obvious functional form appears to fit the data .",
    "next we consider the dynamical behaviour by studying the density of domain walls @xmath7 and persistence probability @xmath8 as functions of time @xmath9 . in this context ,",
    "comparison with the zero temperature dynamics in the ising model and the bs model @xcite will be interesting .",
    "coarsening study for @xmath98 : we start with a completely disordered state where @xmath24 is the estimated separatrix point .",
    "the scaling behaviour of @xmath7 is compatible with a value of @xmath99 at @xmath58 .",
    "as @xmath20 deviates from @xmath5 , the coarsening process becomes very fast : obviously , in the extreme limit @xmath28 or @xmath21 , the system goes to the all up / down configuration almost instantaneously .",
    "in fact for any value of @xmath100 , the power law behaviour for @xmath7 is no longer valid .",
    "this is not surprising , it is known that power law scalings are valid only on the transition point ( e.g. , in the ising model , the order parameter shows exponential decay to its equilibrium value away from the critical temperature ) .",
    "the growth exponent @xmath12 in coarsening phenomena in spin systems can be found out by studying several quantities apart from the domain density @xmath7 which varies as @xmath101 .",
    "these include the variations of the absolute magnetisation with time , total time to reach equilibrium as a function of system size and the fraction of spin flips again as a function of time @xmath9 .",
    "the last quantity , @xmath102 , is expected to follow the same behaviour as @xmath7 since spins at the domain boundary can flip only ( it will be less than @xmath7 in magnitude though ) .",
    "this is true for all models . for @xmath103 and @xmath24 , in the wi model @xmath102",
    "thus varies with time as @xmath104 with @xmath25 .",
    "we have shown in fig .",
    "[ flip ] the scaling behaviour of the flipping probability as this quantity is useful in understanding the persistence behaviour .",
    "the following dynamical scaling form for the persistence probability is used @xcite to obtain both @xmath12 and @xmath13 . @xmath105 the persistence probability saturates at a value @xmath106 at large times in finite systems where",
    "@xmath107 is related to the spatial correlation of the persistent spins at @xmath108 .",
    "so the scaling function @xmath109 with @xmath110 for @xmath111 and @xmath112 constant at large @xmath113 .",
    "we have estimated the exponents @xmath13 and @xmath12 from the above scaling relation for @xmath79 , giving @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "the raw data as well as the scaled data are shown in fig .",
    "[ colper ] .    these exponents are universal in the sense that if one starts at any point on the phase boundary ( i.e. , with the initial fraction of up spins equal to @xmath116 ) , one gets the same values .    in the wi model , @xmath25 as in the bs model but the persistence exponent is different ( by more than ten percent numerically ) .",
    "in fact , @xmath117 obtained here is less than the bs model value ( @xmath118 ) , which is a bit counter - intuitive as the wi model is completely stochastic while the bs model is not . in the bs model",
    ", there is a ballistic motion of the surviving domain walls , which in the course of their motion will flip all the spins that appear on one of their boundaries . with high probability",
    ", these spins will flip once only so that if any flipping occurs it is more likely to affect the persistence probability . in the wi model",
    ", there will be motion of the domain walls in both directions ( though less in comparison to the ising model where pure random walk is executed before the domain walls are annihilated ) , such that the same spin may flip more than once with higher probability and obviously persistence will not be affected when a spin flips more than once . to check this ,",
    "we have computed the distribution @xmath119 of the number ( @xmath120 ) of times a spin flips in both the models .",
    "the results , shown in fig .",
    "[ probdistri ] , exhibit indeed that in the bs model , @xmath121 is much higher compared to the wi model while probability that a spin flips a large number of times ( @xmath122 ) is much less .",
    "( roughly , for @xmath123 , @xmath124 for the bs model and @xmath125 for the wi model with @xmath79 . )",
    "we have already seen that the probability of flipping @xmath102 shows the same scaling behaviour in the two models and this shows why the persistence decays in a slower manner in the present model .    in comparison , in the ising model",
    ", the persistence probability decays fastest although the domain walls perform pure random walk . here",
    ", @xmath126 implies that domains survive much longer and as a result a larger number of spins are flipping at every step .",
    "so although @xmath119 has a much slower decay the persistence probability decays much faster showing that the effect of the slower decay in the number of domain walls is more important than the unbiased random walk motion of each .",
    "stochasticity in the bs model has been introduced in several ways earlier by incorporating a parameter in the model @xcite .",
    "in fact in @xcite , the domain sizes had been considered in the dynamics in a different manner . however",
    ", even such stochasticity in the bs model could not lead to any new dynamical behaviour ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 were found to be equal to @xmath127 and @xmath118 respectively ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the stochastic model considered here shows a different result for @xmath13 even for the unweighted model ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "we have presented a stochastic binary opinion dynamics model with one parameter where the exit probability has a step function like behaviour even in one dimension , in contrast to other familiar models .",
    "one obtains a separatrix which is similar to that appearing in magnetic systems at zero field , separating regions of positive and negative magnetisation although in the latter one considers strictly the equilibrium behaviour .",
    "the results show finite size scaling where the scaling argument is @xmath128 indicating that the width of the region where @xmath64 is not equal to unity or zero decreases as @xmath129 .",
    "the unique behaviour of the exit probability may be present due to the effective long range interactions in the wi model .",
    "however it has been shown previously for the generalised voter and sznajd models that the exit probability does not change its nature even if one makes the range of interaction infinite @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the dynamical rule of wi model which handles the range of interaction in a subtly different manner could be responsible for the behaviour of the exit probability .",
    "a thorough study of similar models with domain size dependent dynamics is in progress to check this @xcite .",
    "one may also attempt to check the dependence of @xmath130 when the problem is considered in higher dimensions .",
    "it is also observed that there is a deviation from the mean field result unlike other models in one dimension .",
    "this deviation is attributed to the fact that the fluctuations which have been ignored ( e.g. , by taking @xmath43 independent of location and replacing all domain sizes by an average value ) are indeed relevant . however , the deviation from mean field estimates is still small such that the mean field result can be considered as a first order calculation .",
    "the other important and interesting result is that the persistence exponent of wi model is not only different but lowest among the well known models , including those where domain size dependent dynamics have been used .",
    "thus the wi model is claimed to belong to a unique dynamical class in opinion dynamics models .",
