    "in 2012 a new boson has been discovered by cms and atlas experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite , whose properties are remarkably similar to the standard model ( sm ) higgs  @xcite .",
    "for example , its mass is @xmath10 gev by atlas collaboration  @xcite or @xmath11 gev by cms collaboration  @xcite , where the first error stands for the statistic error and the second one stands for the systematic error .",
    "if the sm higgs has a mass around @xmath12 gev , then its decay width shall be dominated by @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , many efforts have been made on studying the higgs decays into a bottom pair  @xcite . as a reference , the pure qcd corrections at the two - loop or the three - loop level have been reported in refs .",
    "@xcite , and the explicit expressions up to @xmath13 have been given by ref .",
    "in addition , the higgs decay channel @xmath1 also plays a crucial role in studying the properties of higgs boson .",
    "the coupling of higgs to a pair of gluons , which is mediated at one loop by virtual massive quarks ( essentially generated by the top quark alone ) and becomes independent of the top - quark mass @xmath14 in the limit @xmath15 .",
    "an important feature of @xmath1 is its affinity to the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism for higgs production .",
    "the effective coupling @xmath16 eventually may provide a way to count the number of heavy quarks beyond sm  @xcite .",
    "its next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections are quite large and amount to about @xmath17 in comparison to the leading order contribution  @xcite . later on ,",
    "the qcd corrections for @xmath1 up to three - loop level have been calculated in the limit of an infinitely heavy top quark mass  @xcite .",
    "those great improvements on loop calculations provide us chances for deriving more accurate estimation on higgs properties .",
    "the physical predictions of the theory , calculated up to all orders , are surely independent of the choice of renormalization scale and renormalization scheme due to the renormalization group invariance  @xcite .",
    "whereas , as is well - known , there is renormalization scale and renormalization scheme ambiguities at any finite order .",
    "it is helpful to find an optimal scale setting so that there is no ( or greatly suppressed ) scale or scheme ambiguity at any fixed order and can achieve the most accurate estimation based on the known perturbative calculations .    as an estimation of the physical observable",
    ", one can first take an arbitrary initial renormalization scale @xmath18 and apply some scale setting method to improve the pqcd estimation .",
    "for the conventional scale setting , once the renormalization scale is setting to be an initial value , it will always be fixed during the whole analysis .",
    "that is , for the processes involving higgs , in the literature , one usually take @xmath19 as the central value , which eliminates the large logs in a form as @xmath20 .",
    "because there is no strong reasons for such a choice , as a compensation , one will vary the scale within a certain region , e.g. @xmath21 $ ] , to ascertain the scale uncertainty .",
    "it is often argued that by setting and varying the scale in such a way , one can estimate contributions from higher order terms ; i.e. changing in scale will affect how much of a result comes from feynman diagrams without loops , and how much it comes from the leftover finite parts of loop diagrams . and",
    "because of its perturbative nature , it is a common belief that those scale uncertainties can be reduced after finishing a higher - and - higher order calculation .",
    "however , this _ ad hoc _ assignment of scale and its range usually constitutes an important systematic error in theoretical and experimental analysis .",
    "more explicitly , the conventional scale setting can not answer the questions : why it is @xmath22 and not @xmath23 or others that provides the central estimation ; when there are several typical energy scales for the process , then which one provides the central value ?",
    "several scale setting methods have been suggested , e.g. the renormalization group improved effective coupling method ( fac )  @xcite , the principle of minimum sensitivity ( pms )  @xcite , the brodsky - lepage - mackenzie method ( blm )  @xcite and its underlying principle of maximum conformality ( pmc )  @xcite .",
    "the fac is to improve the perturbative series by requiring all higher - order terms vanish and the pms is to force the fixed - order series to satisfy the renormalization group invariance at the renormalization point .",
    "the blm improves the perturbative series by requiring the @xmath24-terms of at each perturbative order vanish .",
    "the pmc provides the principle underlying the blm , and it suggests a principle to set the optimal renormalization scales up to all orders , they are equivalent to each other through the pmc - blm correspondence principle  @xcite . those methods , being designed to eliminate the scale ambiguity , have quite different consequences and may or may not achieve their goals .",
    "a detailed introduction and comparison of these methods can be found in a recent review  @xcite . in the present paper , we adopt pmc for analyzing the higgs decays .",
    "the main idea of pmc lies in that the pmc scales at each perturbative order are formed by absorbing all non - conformal terms that governs the running behavior of the coupling constant into the coupling constant . at each perturbative order ,",
    "new types of @xmath2-terms will occur , so the pmc scale for each perturbative order is generally different .",
    "even though , one can choose any value to be @xmath25 , the optimal pmc scales and the resulting finite - order pmc prediction are both to high accuracy independent of such arbitrariness .",
    "after pmc scale setting , the divergent renormalon series does not appear and the convergence of the pqcd series can be greatly improved . because of these advantages , the pmc method can be widely applied to high energy physics processes , some examples of which can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    because the pmc provides the underlying principle for blm , the previous features or properties derived by using blm",
    "can also be understood by using pmc . before applying pmc or blm to high - energy processes",
    ", one needs to use the expression with full initial renormalization scale dependence .",
    "that is , those terms that have been eliminated by setting the renormalization scale to be equal to the factorization scale or by setting the initial renormalization to be the typical momentum transfer should be retrieved back .",
    "so , the previous scale dependence analysis or conclusions drawn under the blm should be adopted with great care , since there is misuse of blm in the literature .",
    "it is interesting to show whether the pmc can work well for the inclusive higgs decays and whether the accuracy of the estimations can be improved . in present paper , we show the newly suggested pmc procedure , the so called @xmath9-scheme  @xcite , with much more detail . a comparison with some other suggestions to extend the blm scale setting up to any perturbative orders",
    "shall also be presented .",
    "the remaining parts of the paper are organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we present the calculation technology for applying pmc to higgs decay processes @xmath26 and @xmath27 up to four - loop level . in sec.iii",
    ", we present the numerical results and discussions .",
    "the final section is reserved for a summary .",
    "in this section , we present an improved analysis for the higgs decay channels @xmath26 and @xmath27 by using the pmc @xmath9-scheme . for the purpose ,",
    "* we shall first rearrange the four - loop expressions  @xcite that have been derived under the conventional scale setting in a more general form .",
    "that is , the @xmath24-terms in those expressions that are coming from the light - quark loops and are responsible for controlling the running behavior of the coupling constant shall be transformed into @xmath2-series .",
    "those @xmath2-series via the renormalization group equation rightly control the running behavior of the strong coupling constant .",
    "every process has its own @xmath2-series and its own optimal ( pmc ) scales .",
    "thus , after absorbing all those @xmath2-series into the strong coupling constant via an order - by - order way , we can obtain the optimal running coupling constant for the specific process . * as stated in the introduction , before applying the pmc scale setting , we need to obtain the expressions with full ( initial ) renormalization scale dependence .",
    "for the purpose , at present , we need to transform the four - loop results of @xmath6 or the three - loop results of @xmath28 derived under the conventional assumption of @xmath29 to a more general form that explicitly contains the initial renormalization scale @xmath25 , which may or may not equal to @xmath30 .",
    "this can be achieved by using the strong coupling constant s scale transformation equation up to four - loop level , i.e. + @xmath31 a^{3}_{s}(q ) + \\nonumber\\\\       & & \\left[-\\beta^3_{0 } \\ln^3 \\left(\\frac{q^{*2}}{q^2}\\right ) + \\frac{5}{2 } \\beta_{0}\\beta_{1 } \\ln^2\\left(\\frac{q^{*2}}{q^2}\\right ) -\\beta_{2 } \\ln\\left(\\frac{q^{*2}}{q^2}\\right)\\right ] a^{4}_{s}(q ) + { \\cal o}(a^{5}_{s } ) , \\label{alphasrun }       \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] + where @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are two arbitrary renormalization scales .",
    "* we shall set the pmc scales in an order - by - order manner according to @xmath9-scheme . by doing the loop calculations , the @xmath35-quark mass is treated as massless , cf .",
    "the review on higgs properties  @xcite , there is only an overall @xmath36-factor in the decay width .",
    "since its value is irrelevant to the pmc procedures and should be kept separate during the pmc scale - setting , either the choice of @xmath7-running mass or the pole mass is reasonable . in the formulae , we fix its value to be @xmath37 within the @xmath7-scheme .",
    "a detailed discussion on this point is in preparation , which shows by applying pmc properly , either the choice of pole mass or @xmath7-running mass can get consistent estimation .",
    "recently , a discussion on @xmath38 presents such an example  @xcite .    in the following , we sequently present the results before and after pmc scale setting for the two channels @xmath6 and @xmath28 .      by taking the initial renormalization scale @xmath39 , the analytic decay width with explicit @xmath24 dependence for the channel @xmath0 can be formally written as    @xmath40 \\label{hbbnf } \\\\ & = & \\frac{3g_{f}m_{h } m_{b}^{2}(m_{h } ) } { 4\\sqrt{2}\\pi } \\left[1 + 1.804\\ ; \\alpha_{s}(m_{h})+2.953\\ ; \\alpha_{s}^{2}(m_{h } ) + 1.347\\ ; \\alpha_{s}^{3}(m_{h } ) - 8.475\\ ; \\alpha_{s}^{4}(m_{h } ) + { \\cal o}(\\alpha_s^5)\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath41 is the fermi constant and @xmath42 is the @xmath7 running mass at the scale @xmath30 . for convenience , in the third line , we present the values for the coefficients over the @xmath43-expansion by setting @xmath44 , which explicitly show the relative importance of the perturbative series . the coefficients @xmath45 up to four - loop levels are  @xcite @xmath46    the @xmath9-scheme  @xcite not only illuminates the @xmath2-pattern of the process but also exposes a special degeneracy of the coefficients at different perturbative orders .",

    "moreover , it is noted that such situation could be softened to a certain degree by using the commensurate scale relation  @xcite , or one may solve it by using proper running behavior of the coupling constant in lower scale region  @xcite . * as another subtle point , even if one can eliminate the scale dependence at lower perturbative order as nlo , it may necessary to know the higher - order conformal contributions if we want to achieve even higher precision .",
    "taking the case of @xmath6 as an example , its n@xmath109lo terms improves the nlo estimation by about @xmath110 and the n@xmath111lo terms improves the n@xmath109lo estimation by about @xmath112 .",

    "a choice of @xmath114 is better than the choice of @xmath115 for the conventional scale setting . in fact , under such choice , one can also obtain a more convergent pqcd series for the conventional scale setting .",
    "* as a minor point , taking @xmath6 as an example , we point out a wrong way of estimating the conventional scale error . the correct way is to set an initial scale @xmath25 and get the full @xmath25-dependent expression ( [ hbbbt ] ) , e.g. those terms proportional to @xmath116 are kept , and then by varying @xmath117 $ ] to discuss its scale error . in this way , we have shown that the conventional scale error up to four - loop level is almost eliminated , as shown in fig.([plot : hbb ] ) .",

    "<S> the principle of maximum conformality ( pmc ) has been suggested to eliminate the renormalization scheme and renormalization scale uncertainties , which are unavoidable for the conventional scale setting and are usually important errors for theoretical estimations . in this paper , by applying pmc scale setting , we analyze two important inclusive standard model higgs decay channels , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , up to four - loop and three - loop levels accordingly . </S>",
    "<S> after pmc scale setting , it is found that the conventional scale uncertainty for these two channels can be eliminated to a high degree . </S>",
    "<S> there is small residual initial scale dependence for the higgs decay widths due to unknown higher - order @xmath2-terms . </S>",
    "<S> up to four - loop level , we obtain @xmath3 mev and up to three - loop level , we obtain @xmath4 mev , where the first error is caused by varying @xmath5 gev and the second error for @xmath6 is caused by varying the @xmath7-running mass @xmath8 gev . </S>",
    "<S> taking @xmath6 as an example , we present a comparison of three blm - based scale setting approaches , e.g. the pmc - i approach based on the pmc - blm correspondence , the @xmath9-scheme and the seblm approach , all of which are designed to provide effective ways to identify non - conformal @xmath2-series at each perturbative order . at four - loop level , all those approaches lead to good pqcd convergence , they have almost the same pqcd series , and their predictions are almost independent on the initial renormalization scale . in this sense , those approaches are equivalent to each other . </S>",
