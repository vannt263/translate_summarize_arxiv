    "detailed abundances of stars in globular clusters ( gcs ) are essential for two primary goals : 1 ) understanding the nature of gc formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) and 2 ) tracing the properties of field star populations in distant , unresolved galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) . for most elements ,",
    "the abundances of gc stars trace those of the field stars in their birth environment @xcite , providing probes of a galaxy s star formation history , abundance gradients , chemical evolution , and assembly history .",
    "however , for a handful of other elements , from light elements like c , n , o , and na to heavy neutron capture elements like ba and eu , milky way ( mw ) gcs host star - to - star variations that are unique to gcs and are not seen in most field stars ( detections of field stars with these abundance variations are thought to be accreted from dissolved gcs ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "similar variations have also been observed in classical , old gcs in dwarf galaxies , including the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ; @xcite ) .",
    "these variations seem to be present in m31 gcs as well , and do affect the integrated abundances from distant , unresolved gcs ( @xcite , @xcite ) . despite the prevalence of gc multiple populations , the cause of these abundance variations is not yet well - understood .",
    "observations of gcs outside of the mw , particularly ones that are unlike standard mw gcs , are necessary to understand gc formation . without a more complete understanding of the multiple populations in gcs , interpreting integrated abundances of unresolved clusters",
    "remains difficult .",
    "one cluster that is particularly intriguing for detailed abundance studies is the intermediate - age lmc cluster ngc  1718 . _",
    "hubble space telescope _",
    "photometry has revealed that the cluster is of intermediate age and moderately high metallicity , with an age @xmath2 gyr and @xmath0\\sim-0.4 $ ] @xcite .",
    "calcium triplet spectroscopy of three cluster stars suggests a slightly lower value of @xmath0\\sim-0.8 $ ] @xcite , while comparisons with other lmc clusters of a similar age suggest that ngc  1718 should have a metallicity of @xmath0\\sim-0.42 $ ] @xcite .",
    "ngc  1718 is far too massive @xcite to be an open cluster ",
    "it is therefore distinctly different from the classical , metal - rich mw gcs , which are all older than 10 gyr .",
    "intermediate - age gcs like ngc  1718 are therefore excellent targets for studying the nature of gc multiple populations and for examining relatively recent star formation in the lmc .",
    "the first detailed abundances for ngc  1718 were derived by @xcite from integrated light ( il ) spectroscopy , where a single spectrum is obtained from the entire stellar population . with a spectrum that only covered @xmath3% of the cluster , they found ngc  1718 to be a moderate - metallicity ( @xmath0 = -0.7 $ ] ) , intermediate - age ( 1.25 - 2 gyr ) , solar [ ca / fe ] cluster with a very low mg abundance ( @xmath4 = -0.9 $ ] ) . while mg is not always expected to trace the heavier @xmath1-elements like ca and ti in a low mass galaxy , it is difficult to explain such a low mg abundance through canonical chemical evolution scenarios .",
    "colucci et al . suggested that ngc  1718 s low integrated mg abundance indicated that the cluster was enriched solely through ejecta from a type ia supernova , a scenario which would increase fe significantly without appreciably changing mg @xcite .",
    "however , similarly low-[mg / fe ] field stars have not been found in the lmc @xcite , as would be expected if ngc  1718 formed in a environment enriched only by a type ia supernova .    because of its age and mass , ngc  1718 is also interesting as a gc .",
    "the source of multiple populations within gcs continues to be debated ; a particularly contentious point is whether the multiple populations are actually multiple _ generations _ with a very small ( @xmath5 myr ) age spread . under many multiple population formation scenarios , the ratios of `` primordial , '' first generation stars ( with normal abundance ratios ) to `` extreme '' second generation stars ( with enhanced [ na / fe ] and deficient [ o / fe ] ) requires a significant amount of mass loss from the first generation prior to the formation of the second generation . convincing age spreads",
    "have not yet been detected in any of the younger lmc gcs , including ngc  1718 .",
    "( despite its broad main sequence , which suggests that the cluster hosts an age spread , its red clump implies that ngc 1718 does host a population with a single age ; @xcite . )",
    "however , although multiple populations have been spectroscopically confirmed in lmc and small magellanic cloud gcs older than @xmath6 gyr @xcite _ there is not yet any convincing evidence for the existence of multiple populations in gcs younger than @xmath6 gyr _ @xcite .",
    "this difference implies that the lmc gcs that formed more recently may be fundamentally different from the old gcs that formed early in the universe .",
    "the intermediate - age and young lmc gcs are therefore important targets for understanding the nature of multiple populations within gcs .",
    "this paper presents the first abundance analyses of individual stars in ngc  1718 , from high resolution spectroscopy of two cluster members .",
    "these abundances are calculated differentially with respect to the well studied giant arcturus , and therefore have relatively low systematic errors .",
    "the detailed abundances of the two stars are then examined in light of ngc  1718 s context as a young gc and as a member of the lmc .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      it is notable that the systematic uncertainty on [ fe@xmath7/h ] in table  [ table : finalerrors ] is quite small ; this is apparently due to the covariance between the effects of t@xmath8 and @xmath9 on [ fe@xmath7/h ] : for the fe@xmath7 and ii lines in these cool stars an increase in temperature results in a slightly lower fe@xmath7 abundance ( due to excitation ) ; however , this change in the fe@xmath7 abundance is compensated - for by the corresponding change in @xmath10 . the same temperature change results in a relatively large decrease in the derived fe@xmath7 abundance , presumably due to an increase in fe ionization .",
    "table  [ table : finalerrors ] also shows that for most abundance ratios [ x / fe@xmath7 ] exhibits smaller systematic uncertainty than [ x / fe@xmath7 ] , even for ionized metals and [ o@xmath7 ] lines ; thus , the [ x / fe@xmath7 ] abundance ratios provide the most reliable estimate .",
    "note that the implied systematic errors in abundance ratios are only as good as the input variances , co - variances and abundance sensitivity to atmosphere parameters . for an element ratio where the actual systematic abundance sensitivity is small , small errors in the adopted inputs to equation  [ eqn : a1 ] can result in a negative computed variance , implying unrealistic , or imaginary , 1@xmath12 uncertainties , when they are simply close to zero ; in this case , the uncertainty in the ratio is dominated by the random error component .",
