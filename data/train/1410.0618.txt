    "the kirchhoff law of voltage is a simple yet powerful rule that is presented in virtually all electromagnetism books .",
    "this law is a direct application of the energy conservation , yet there are other assumptions that are not normally discussed .",
    "most of the literature argue that the typical size of circuit must be much smaller than the wavelength of the emitted radiation  @xcite , as a condition for the validity of this law but some other assumptions have to be taken into account .",
    "one of them is based on faraday s law that states that the electromotive force , defined as the line integral of the electric field vector around the circuit closed loop , is proportional to the time rate of change of the magnetic flux through the loop , and can be written as the following : @xmath1 and if the current varies in the time the electromotive force is not zero , leading to an additional term in the kirchhoff law .",
    "this can be circumvented by assuming the area of the circuit , as well as the variation of the magnetic field , are small enough or by assuming that the current is slowly varying  @xcite .",
    "the second assumption , not normally stated but related to the first one , assumes that the energy radiated by the circuit is negligible when compared with other energy scales involved in the problem .    in this work",
    "we intend to overcome these hypotheses and present a simple model that hopefully clarifies the situation to some extent .",
    "we consider a simple @xmath2 circuit .",
    "if we assume ideal capacitor , inductor and wires in the classical description , one obtains a perpetually oscillating current .",
    "however , intuitively we known that this result is not very realistic . if we consider a circular ( or a square ) mesh [ see fig .",
    "( [ fig : circular_mesh ] ) ] , on the other hand , we could add into the recipe a term related to the magnetic and electric dipole radiation , given by the larmor formula  @xcite . in doing so , we obtain an effective resistance , which depends basically of the geometry of the mesh , of its natural frequency and the inductor geometry . the overall electric effective resistance is related to all sort of loss of energy , by the mechanical work done over the current carrying electrons and by the energy that flows out in an irreversible way in the form of radiation , as stated by the poynting s theorem .",
    "we have analysed elsewhere  @xcite the problem of the two capacitors , the discharge of a capacitor associated with an identical and initially discharged , where the equilibrium state as well as the energy dissipated in the process are always the same , regardless the presence of a resistor in the system .",
    "we have made clear how this system reaches equilibrium , and we have discussed the dissipation mechanisms and the role played by both the joule effect and radiation . in this sense",
    "the present paper generalize the former and goes beyond in order to complement the kirchhoff s circuit law .    what motivate us to write",
    "this article is the fact that most of the students do not well understand the fact that when the electric circuit radiates the traditional equation of the rlc circuit is no longer valid and must undergo correction .",
    "here we try to give a direction of how to understand the problem and how to approach it , giving a support for students and teachers in this subject that can be quite tricky  @xcite .",
    "composed by a @xmath0 circuit showing the capacitor radiating as electric dipole .",
    "the loop and the inductor also radiate ( not shown ) as magnetic dipole . ]",
    "the kirchhoff s circuit law states that for a structure such as a mesh or a circuit loop , starting from a point and adding voltages difference across the circuit elements , after describing a complete loop the same potential as that of the starting point is obtained , and its mathematical formulation is written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the potential difference between the terminals of an element in the circuit , and @xmath5 the number of elements .    this result can be derived from the general energy balance .",
    "we can think in terms of the poynting s theorem , related to the conservation of energy in the system formed by the electromagnetic field and matter . in its integral form",
    "this theorem can be written as  @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the current density vector , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , as stated before , the electric and magnetic fields , @xmath10 is the poynting s vector , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are , respectively , the electric displacement and the auxiliar magnetic field vector .",
    "this equation states that the time variation of electromagnetic energy in the field , the right hand side , is due to the work carried out on the charges , represented here by the joule effect and by the work done over the charges by the battery , the first term in the left - hand side of equation ( [ teoremapoynting ] ) , and the energy that flows to the outside , represented by the surface integral of the poynting vector , that represents the energy radiated by the circuit .",
    "this last term is normally neglected in order to calculate the current flowing in the circuit , as an approximation .    for an @xmath0 circuit forced by a battery , for example , with the assumption that the system does not radiate",
    ", the poynting theorem can be cast in the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the power supplied by the battery , @xmath15 is the magnetic energy stored in the inductor , @xmath16 is the electric energy stored in the capacitor and @xmath17 is the power dissipated in the resistor .",
    "using the definition of current @xmath18 we get the standard circuit law @xmath19    in the derivation of the above equations the hypothesis that the system does not radiate is implicit , and there is only one mechanism of energy dissipation due to the joule effect .",
    "this assumption is not so bad when the electrical resistance is large enough , that is , much greater than the radiation loss from the circuit , but when we are dealing with a circuit without electric resistance such as an @xmath2 circuit , we are induced to think that the current never stops , even without a battery source .    in order to clarify this discussion",
    "we could remember a curious fact about superconducting ( i.e. , with no joule dissipation at all ) current carrying wires , which is somewhat related to the issues discussed in this work .",
    "a steady electric current flowing in a superconducting circular loop does not radiate , thus maintaining this current eternal .",
    "one could believe that due to the presence of accelerated charges this system would radiate , but the fact is that stationary currents do not radiate ( for a detailed proof for the case of a superconducting circular loop see , for instance , reference @xcite ) .",
    "however , for the case of an @xmath2 circuit formed by superconducting wires we find that the current @xmath20 slowly decays as the time passes , and therefore is not stationary .",
    "even more , we find a slowly decaying oscillating current , in a similar way as one can see in an @xmath0 circuit with small electrical resistance .",
    "as we will see later , this current leads to oscillating magnetic and electric dipoles . as a consequence",
    ", even an ideal @xmath2 circuit radiates , which means that the current eventually vanishes .",
    "the main question to be addressed here is what sort of changes we have to make in the kirchhoff law in order to include radiation from the circuit , and derive a differential equation that allows us to solve and get the circuit current as a function of time .",
    "there are some different mechanisms for dissipation that could be included in an @xmath0 circuit aside the joule effect , like the magnetic and electric dipole radiation",
    ". the electric dipole radiation would be due to the oscillating charge in capacitor , and the magnetic counterpart would be due to the geometry of the mesh and to the inductor , both behaving like an oscillating magnetic dipole .",
    "these terms are very similar , as we will see on the next subsections .",
    "the first contribution that we could take into account is due to the joule effect . as stated by the law that bears the same name , when an electric current @xmath21 passes through a conductor , there is an irreversible energy transfer from the conductor to the medium in which it is embedded , whose power is given by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the electric resistance of the conductor .",
    "this contribution is well understood and established , and leads , in the case of an @xmath0 circuit , to an electric current that decays exponentially .",
    "here we go into another well understood dissipation mechanism , although not frequently included in circuit analysis . considering the accumulated charge on the capacitor plates",
    ", we have an electric dipole which is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the distance between the plates of the capacitor ( we consider a simple capacitor of parallel plates ) . as the current varies the electric dipole @xmath26",
    "is also modified , and we could include a dissipated power due to this electric dipole for the radiation zone ( @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the radius of the rlc mesh ) , which is given by the larmor formula .",
    "the total radiated power is given by @xcite @xmath29^{2 } .",
    "\\label{electric_dipole_contribution}\\ ] ] since @xmath30 varies harmonically , this quantity can be easy calculated ..      for the magnetic dipole radiation , there are two different sources .",
    "first , we can consider that the circular loop constitutes a magnetic dipole @xmath31 , which intensity is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the area of the circular loop .",
    "but there is also a magnetic dipole due to the inductor , that would be given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the number of turns of the inductor and @xmath36 is the area of each one of the turns .",
    "depending on the ratio between @xmath37 and @xmath38 , one of the terms could be more important than the other .",
    "however , for both of them , we can calculate the emitted radiation power by using larmor formula , given in this case by @xcite @xmath39^{2 } \\ ; . \\label{magnetic_dipole_contributions}\\ ] ]    with equations ( [ electric_dipole_contribution ] ) and ( [ magnetic_dipole_contributions ] ) we can extend the kirchhoff law of voltage , which is derived in the next section .",
    "as previously discussed , the usual @xmath0 circuit leads to an exponentially decaying current . if , in the other hand , we consider an @xmath2 circuit , one obtains a perpetual oscillating current .",
    "however , this last result is somewhat artificial . in order to clarify this question , as pointed previously",
    ", one could consider a circular loop of radius @xmath28 ( and a corresponding area @xmath33 ) .",
    "related to this circuit , the rate of energy dissipation , due to the electric and magnetic dipole radiation , is given by equations ( [ electric_dipole_contribution ] ) and ( [ magnetic_dipole_contributions ] ) ( this latter has two terms , see eq . ( [ magnetic_dipole_mesh ] ) and eq . ( [ magnetic_dipole_inductor ] ) ) , @xmath40^{2 }   + \\frac{\\mu_{0}}{6\\pi c^{3 } }   \\big[\\ddot{\\vec{m}}_{m}(t)\\big]^{2 } + \\frac{\\mu_{0}}{6\\pi c } \\big[\\ddot{\\vec{p}}(t)\\big]^{2 } \\ ; ,   \\label{radiaton_terms}\\ ] ] in si units .",
    "if we require energy conservation again , by adding this time the power formula given by eq .",
    "( [ radiaton_terms ] ) we obtain @xmath41 it is important to remark that we are neglecting retardation effect of the emitted field over the electric current dynamics in the circuit .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption since the circuit is much greater than the emitted wavelength , as stated before .",
    "if we assume that the current in the circuit still oscillate in the form @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the frequency of the external electromotive force , and @xmath44 is the damping term , all terms in eq .",
    "( [ radiaton_terms ] ) leads to @xmath45^{2 } \\propto i^2 .",
    "\\label{eq : radiation_resistance}\\ ] ]    this means that both , the electric and magnetic terms are responsible for the circuit s radiation , and are very similar to the typical dissipated power due to an electric resistance . with this in mind , albeit the radiative terms appear to be much more complicated , from the form of the radiative power , we again obtain an exponentially decaying current , and we can put all types of dissipation together in just one term in the differential equation .    indeed , in antenna theory , this is very well known subject , since antennas are designed to radiate @xcite .",
    "usually , for an efficient antenna , the radiation resistance is the most significant contribution to the overall resistance .",
    "therefore , in order to correctly describe the radiating circuits , we also need to modify the kirchhoff voltage law , so that we have a consistent theory .    in the next section",
    "we perform a comparison between the contributions of each of these terms . for now , all we can say is , although we have followed the same steps normally used on the derivation of the kirchhoff law of voltage , if one includes the radiation terms the perpetually oscillating current no longer holds , giving rise to an exponential decaying current .",
    "to perform a comparison between each of radiative terms and the joule effect contribution itself , first we need to obtain an expression for the effective resistance due to the radiation terms .",
    "so , we need to write the dissipated power in terms of @xmath46 .",
    "the @xmath47 constant would be the effective resistance .    for the eq .",

    "this leads to the following effective electric radiation resistance , @xmath50    similarly , the eq .",
    "( [ magnetic_dipole_contributions ] ) gives @xmath51 \\ ; .",
    "\\label{effective_resistance_mag}\\ ] ]    as previously stated , the relative relevance of the two terms of the magnetic dipole radiation depends of the ratio between @xmath52 and @xmath38 .",
    "the ratio between @xmath53 and @xmath54 is given by @xmath55    we can perform some estimations for the parameters that appears in eqs .",
    "( [ effective_resistance_elec ] ) and ( [ effective_resistance_mag ] ) .",
    "using s.i .",
    "units we can also compare their contributions with typical values for the electric resistance @xmath23 , since all of then would be measured in ohms . under the following values",
    "( @xmath56 @xmath57 , @xmath58 @xmath59 , @xmath60 @xmath61 , @xmath62 @xmath63 , @xmath64 @xmath65 , @xmath66 @xmath67 and @xmath68 @xmath69 ) one finds @xmath70    as expected , both effective radiating resistances are small when compared to typical values of electric resistance .",
    "however , appropriate choices for the parameters would make then comparable , enabling one to observe experimentally a decaying current contribution due to radiation in a superconducting circuit , or even in a  real \" suitable circuit .",
    "this is in fact what happens in an efficient antenna .",
    "the radiation resistance are designed to be much greater than the ohmic resistance @xcite .",
    "an antenna has a more complicated geometry and the electric current is not uniform , although the radiation mechanism is essentially the same .",
    "given that the system heats and radiates it is interesting to know the spectrum associated with these losses , that is , we would like to calculate the total power dissipated by joule effect and radiation in a given frequency range .",
    "the power spectrum , or the dissipated power per unit frequency is given by the expression  @xcite @xmath71 =    re\\left [ ( z(\\omega)i(\\omega))^ { * } i(\\omega)\\right ] =   r_{t } i(\\omega ) i(-\\omega ) \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is the total resistance present in the circuit .    a particular solution of equation ( [ rlc ] )",
    "can be obtained by fourier transform method . setting the battery voltage source as @xmath73 we get the following power spectrum @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the amplitude of battery voltage",
    "[ see fig .",
    "( [ fig : p_x_w ] ) ] .",
    "it is interesting to compare this spectrum for different loss mechanisms , when the joule effect is more important , and when the radiation is preponderant .",
    "the width of the distribution is determined by the resistance @xmath76 that is present in the circuit , and it becomes very narrow when the electrical resistance is zero , in this case the width of the spectral line is entirely defined by the radiation resistance , as can be seen in fig .",
    "( [ fig : p_x_w ] ) .",
    "in this work we have made a modification in the kirchhoff law of voltage , by including the larmor power formula for both electric and magnetic dipole radiation in the energy conservation law , that gives rise to a differential equation for the current , which takes into account both joule and radiative dissipation effects .",
    "it is interesting to note the similarity in the expressions associated with the joule dissipation , and the dipole radiation given by the larmor formula , both proportional to the square of the current .",
    "it is precisely this similarity that allows for a simple unified analysis for dissipation .",
    "it is also important to have some awareness of how one can go beyond simple small antennas to compute the radiation resistance for circuits of arbitrary complexity .",
    "if we have used another radiation system , other than a dipole that emits just in one frequency , we would have a different equation for the current , and its solution would be not so simple , but in any case the presented change in the kirchhoff s voltage law would still be valid .",
    "this is a challenge that we try to confront in the next future .",
