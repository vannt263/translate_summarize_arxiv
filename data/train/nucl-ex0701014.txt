    "relativistic heavy - ion collisions at incident energies ranging from @xmath2 to @xmath4  @xmath3  gevprovide a unique opportunity to study the behavior of nuclear matter at high densities .",
    "these studies are important challenges for testing the present understanding of nuclear matter .",
    "in addition , they are of relevance for astrophysics , as the modelling of neutron stars or of supernovae depends on the properties of nuclear matter under these extreme conditions  @xcite .    in central collisions at the incident energies under investigation densities of 2  3 times normal nuclear matter density can be reached @xcite .",
    "a sensitive probe to test these conditions is the production of strange mesons at or below the production thresholds of these particles in free nn collisions .",
    "the rest mass of charged kaons is 0.454 gev . for the k@xmath0production",
    "the threshold in nn collisions is 1.58 gev ( in the laboratory system ) as defined by the associate production @xmath12 and it is 2.5 gev for the k@xmath1production via pair creation @xmath13 .",
    "the key mechanism for the k@xmath0production in heavy - ion reactions at these incident energies is the accumulation of the necessary energy by multiple collisions of particles inside the reaction zone .",
    "higher densities increase the number of these collisions and especially second generation collisions like @xmath14 with sufficiently high relative momentum to create a k@xmath0occur most frequently during the high - density phase of the reaction .",
    "the density reached in the reaction zone depends on the stiffness of nuclear matter .",
    "because of their specific production mechanism and because of their rather long mean free path ( @xmath15  fm at normal nuclear density ) k@xmath0mesons are ideal probes to explore the high - density phase of a heavy - ion reaction and to study the stiffness of the nuclear equation of state ( eos )  @xcite .    in contrast , the behavior of k@xmath1mesons in a dense nuclear medium is expected to be very different from the one of the k@xmath0mesons due to two distinct properties :    \\(i ) the interaction with nuclear matter : the k@xmath0are hardly absorbed in nuclear matter due to strangeness conservation .",
    "it is very unlikely that a rare k@xmath0(containing an @xmath16 quark ) encounters an equally rare hyperon y ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) containing an @xmath19 quark .",
    "the k@xmath1on the contrary , can easily be absorbed on a nucleon converting it into a hyperon and a pion .",
    "consequently , the mean free path of the k@xmath1is significantly shorter than the one of the k@xmath0 .",
    "the strangeness - exchange reaction @xmath20 has a large cross section and is therefore responsible for the appearance and disappearance of k@xmath1mesons .",
    "this channel has been suggested to be the dominant production mechanism in nucleus - nucleus collisions  @xcite and this has been demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) the influence of kn potentials : according to various theoretical approaches the kn interaction is governed by the superposition of a scalar and a vector potential @xcite . while the scalar potential acts attractively on both kaon species , the vector potential repels k@xmath0and attracts k@xmath1 . for k@xmath0these",
    "two contributions almost cancel leading to a small repulsive @xmath21 interaction . for the k@xmath1the addition of both attractive interactions results in a strongly attractive potential .",
    "attempts to observe these effects in the respective production cross sections are under discussion  @xcite .",
    "these potentials are predicted to have a sizeable effect on the azimuthal emission patterns of k@xmath0and of k@xmath1(elliptic flow ) @xcite which has been observed at the kaon spectrometer @xcite .",
    "this paper intends to give a comprehensive overview on the cross sections and on the emission patterns of the k@xmath0and of the k@xmath1production in mass - symmetric heavy - ion reactions in the incident energy range from @xmath2 to @xmath9  @xmath3  gev .",

    "the short distance of @xmath24 - @xmath25  m from the target to the focal plane minimizes the number of kaon decays in flight .",
    "the loss of kaons by decay and due to the geometrical acceptance is accounted for by corrections which are determined by monte - carlo simulations using the code geant  @xcite .",

    "the latter allows for a second time - of - flight measurement for background rejection and for the determination of the collision centrality using the number of measured charged particles .",
    "the trajectory reconstruction is based on three large - area multi - wire proportional counters ( mwpc 1 - 3 )  @xcite , one between the quadrupole and the dipole and two behind the dipole magnet , each of them measuring two spatial coordinates .",
    "the efficiencies for kaon detection are larger than 95% for each of these detectors .",
    "the beam intensity is monitored using two scintillator telescopes positioned at backward angles ( @xmath29 ) , measuring the flux of charged particles produced in the target which is proportional to the beam intensity .",
    "the absolute normalization is obtained in separate measurements at low beam intensities using a plastic scintillation detector directly in the beam line .",

    "[ angdis_data_calc ] this observable is hardly sensitive to the choice of the kn in - medium interaction .    the differences in the inverse slope parameters and in the polar angle distributions of the k@xmath0and of the k@xmath1mesons may as well be influenced by different emission times of the two particle species .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ iqmd_time ] showing the results of iqmd calculations .",
    "the upper panel shows the density @xmath111 reached in the collision zone normalized to normal nuclear matter density @xmath112 as a function of time .",
    "the lower panel shows the rate of emitted k@xmath0and k@xmath1mesons as a function of their creation time .",
    "it can clearly be seen that according to this transport - model calculation those k@xmath1leaving the reaction zone are created at a rather late stage of the reaction , significantly later than the k@xmath0which are mainly created during the high - density phase .",
    "this difference in emission times is caused by the strangeness - exchange reaction reabsorbing most of the k@xmath1produced during the high - density phase . according to iqmd",
    "the primary production of both , k@xmath0and k@xmath1mesons , is isotropic . as will be discussed in detail in  @xcite the polar angle anisotropy of the k@xmath0is mainly caused by rescattering .",
    "the k@xmath1on the contrary are emitted at a late stage of the reaction when the spectator matter has moved away and can not cause a significant anisotropy .",
    "positively charged kaons are expected to carry information on the high density - phase of the heavy - ion collision due to two reasons :    \\i ) the k@xmath0production occurs via multiple collisions e.g.  via processes like @xmath113 followed by a subsequent interaction of the @xmath114 resonance like @xmath115 .",
    "these multi - step processes occur predominantly at higher densities  @xcite .",
    "\\ii ) the rather large mean free path of the k@xmath0(@xmath15  fm at normal nuclear density @xmath112 ) reduces the probability of further inelastic interactions prior to their emission .",
    "as a result of the k@xmath0production mechanism their yields are sensitive to the density reached in the collision which is related to the stiffness of the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) as parameterized by the compression modulus @xmath116 defined as @xmath117 which quantifies the curvature of @xmath118 at normal nuclear density @xmath119 .    figure  [ k_sigma_energy ] in sect .",

    "the multiplicities per @xmath3 are the higher the heavier the collision system is .",
    "this reflects that the k@xmath0mesons are predominantly produced in multiple collisions which are more likely to occur the higher the density is in the reaction .",
    "early transport - model calculations predicted that the k@xmath0yield in collisions would be enhanced by a factor of about 2 if a soft rather than a hard nuclear equation of state is assumed @xcite .",
    "recent calculations take into account modifications of the kaon properties in the dense nuclear medium leading to a repulsive @xmath121 potential which depends on the baryonic density @xcite and which leads to a reduction of the calculated k@xmath0yields . to disentangle these two competing effects we use the ratio of two k@xmath0excitation functions  @xcite , one from and one from .",
    "the maximum baryonic density reached in reactions is about 2  3 times normal nuclear matter density while the increase in density in collisions is significantly less pronounced .",
    "moreover , the maximum baryonic density reached in reactions depends on the compression modulus of nuclear matter @xmath122 @xcite whereas in collisions this dependence is rather weak @xcite .",
    "hence , the ratio of the k@xmath0multiplicity per nucleon @xmath123 in to the one in is expected to be sensitive to the compression modulus @xmath122 .",
    "furthermore , it provides the advantage that systematic uncertainties within the experimental data are partly cancelled .",
    "this ratio in addition has turned out to be hardly affected by input quantities of the transport - model calculations which are less well known , like cross sections of individual reaction channels , the strength of the kn potentials , or the lifetime of the @xmath114 resonance , as has been systematically studied in  @xcite .",

    "this is observed for all collision systems and for all centralities . * the polar angle distributions",
    "exhibit a forward - backward rise which is more pronounced for k@xmath0than for k@xmath1mesons .",
    "k@xmath1mesons produced in central collisions are emitted almost isotropically .    from the systematics of these experimental results and from detailed comparisons to transport model calculations the following conclusions on the properties of dense nuclear matter as created in heavy - ion collisions and on the production mechanisms of k@xmath0and of k@xmath1mesons can be drawn :    * _ the k@xmath1and the k@xmath0yields are coupled by strangeness exchange : _ despite their significantly different thresholds in binary nn collisions the multiplicities of k@xmath0and of k@xmath1mesons show the same dependence on the collision centrality .",
    "they are even similar for different collision systems .",
    "this can be explained by the k@xmath1being predominantly produced via strangeness exchange from hyperons which on the other hand are created together with the k@xmath0mesons .",
    "strangeness exchange is predicted to be the main contribution to the k@xmath1production in heavy - ion collisions at sis energies by transport model calculations as well . * _ k@xmath0and k@xmath1mesons exhibit different freeze - out conditions : _ transport - model calculations predict different emission times for k@xmath0and for k@xmath1mesons as a consequence of the strangeness - exchange reaction .",
    "the k@xmath1are continuously produced and re - absorbed and finally leave the reaction zone much later than the k@xmath0mesons .",
    "this and the kinematics of the strangeness - exchange process manifests itself in an isotropic emission of the k@xmath1 in central collisions and by systematically lower inverse slope parameters of the k@xmath1energy distributions compared to k@xmath0 .",
    "* _ the nuclear equation of state is soft : _ the increase of @xmath137 with the size of the collision system @xmath3 points towards a dependence of the k@xmath0production on the density reached in the collision .",
    "the ratio of the k@xmath0multiplicities in and as a function of the incident energy allows to extract the compression modulus @xmath122 of nuclear matter by comparing to transport - model calculations .",
    "only calculations using a soft nuclear equation - of - state ( @xmath138  mev ) can describe the data .",
    "this conclusion is rather insensitive to the various input parameters of such calculations . a soft nuclear equation of state is further supported by comparing the centrality dependence of the k@xmath0multiplicities in collisions to transport model calculations .",
    "our results demonstrate the importance of the strangeness - exchange reaction for the production and propagation of negatively charged kaons in heavy - ion collisions at incident energies from @xmath2 to @xmath9  @xmath3  gev , on the one hand coupling their yield to the k@xmath0-production , on the other hand causing a rather late emission of the k@xmath1 . the production of positively charged kaons itself is strongly linked to the high - density phase of a heavy - ion collision allowing to determine that the equation - of - state of nuclear matter is soft within the density regime explored by heavy - ion collisions between @xmath2 and @xmath4  @xmath3  gev .",
