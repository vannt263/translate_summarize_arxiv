    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the brightest phenomena in the universe , releasing as much electromagnetic energy in tens of seconds as the entire milky way galaxy does in a few years @xcite .",
    "they typically reach energies of around 5 x 10@xmath0 ergs when beaming is accounted for @xcite .",
    "their temporal distribution shows a bimodality @xcite which separates them into ` long ' or ` short ' grbs ( lgrb and sgrb respectively ) depending on a parameter known as t@xmath1 ; the time in which 90% of the gamma - ray fluence is detected .",
    "nominally , long bursts have t@xmath2 seconds , and short ones have t@xmath3 seconds , but in reality the distinction is far more blurred for a significant number of cases ( eg @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "both classes have been observed to be distributed isotropically across the sky @xcite .",
    "the most popular theory for sgrbs is that they are caused by mergers of compact objects , such as double neutron star ( ns  ns ) binaries , ns  black hole ( bh ) mergers , white dwarf ( wd )  ns mergers , wd  bh mergers or possibly even wd  wd mergers @xcite .",
    "lgrbs are perhaps the better understood of the two classes , and are believed to be the product of massive star collapse @xcite since , in cases where it would be observable , they are always accompanied by type ib / c supernovae @xcite .",
    "sgrbs are in fact not necessarily short .",
    "@xcite found that 1/3 of their sample of sgrbs exhibit extended emission ( ee ) in their light curves , and an even greater fraction were found to be extended in the batse catalogue .",
    "ee is the term given to a rebrightening in the light curve after the initial emission spike .",
    "it happens at early times , usually beginning at @xmath4 10 s , and typically has lower peak flux but much longer duration than the initial spike , resulting in comparable total fluences between the two @xcite .",
    "those bursts that were believed to exhibit ee were catalogued by @xcite .",
    "these bursts present a challenge to the standard merger scenario , since they require an injection of energy arising seconds after the trigger , then naturally switching off at later times , around 100 s after trigger in the rest frame .",
    "one central engine with the potential to provide such an energy supply is a rapidly spinning , highly magnetized neutron star , known as a magnetar @xcite . whether by collapse or merger , this magnetar may be formed with sufficient rotational energy to avoid collapsing into a bh @xcite .",
    "grbs require a rapidly rotating central engine with a strong , large scale magnetic field of around @xmath5 g or higher @xcite , and a magnetar with such a field and an initial spin period @xmath6 ms has enough rotational energy to power a @xmath7 erg grb .",
    "magnetar spin down has been often discussed as a source of grbs , both long @xcite and short @xcite , in the literature , and has also been suggested as the origin of ee @xcite along with a variety of other mechanisms .",
    "alternatives include a two - jet solution @xcite , fallback accretion @xcite , r - process heating of the accretion disc @xcite and magnetic reconnection and turbulence @xcite .",
    "a major motivation for a common central engine can be seen in figure 1 ; when all bursts are overlaid , a striking similarity can be seen in the evolution of the bursts , both temporally and energetically .",
    "conformity like this is highly suggestive of a shared origin .",
    "+    this paper is structured as follows : section 2 contains the sample selection and data reduction process while section 3 details the motivation for finding a common central engine for ee grbs .",
    "the magnetar model is introduced in section 4 , the results are discussed in section 5 , and the main conclusions are summarised in section 6 .",
    ".selected sample of ee grbs . bracketed values for redshift , @xmath8 ,",
    "indicate no published value was available . in these cases",
    "the mean value of the ee sample where @xmath8 is known was used . a - upper limit . 1 - @xcite ; 2 - @xcite ; 3 - @xcite ; 4 - @xcite ; 5 - @xcite ; 6 - @xcite ; 7 - @xcite ; 8 - @xcite [ cols=\"<,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the calculated spin periods for the birth of the magnetar lie comfortably within allowed parameter space ( figure 3 ) and are consistent with values predicted in the literature @xcite .",
    "bursts that do not have a set redshift may vary on the energy scale , with an error of @xmath9 in @xmath8 roughly corresponding to an order of magnitude in the luminosity scale .",
    "@xcite discussed the effect of varying redshift on the results for @xmath10 and @xmath11 in their work , and the argument is well illustrated by figure 9(b ) in @xcite .",
    "the general result is that a higher @xmath8 corresponds to a lower rotation period ( ie faster spin ) and lower magnetic field .",
    "a good example is the change in results if the sample average redshift @xmath12 is used for grb 051227 ; fitting the magnetic dipole spin - down model then gives a magnetic field @xmath13 g and a spin period of @xmath14 ms .",
    "the light curve is also far less luminous .",
    "the ee energy release is just @xmath15 ergs , which translates into @xmath16 ms .",
    "figure 4 shows where the values found for @xmath10 and @xmath17 place the ee bursts relative to other sgrb and lgrb populations taken from figure 9(a ) of @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that the ee bursts show properties that most closely resemble the unstable magnetar population of sgrbs .",
    "since both magnetic field and spin period are very similar between these two groups , the difference must lie in some other property , perhaps mass or formation mechanism .",
    "this key difference must prevent the ee sample bursts from collapsing into bhs , and enable , perhaps even cause , the release of ee energy .",
    "@xcite showed that accretion discs and fallback accretion exhibit a much wider spread of behaviours when the compact objects involved in the merger have different masses . in their work , a ns ",
    "ns binary showed fairly homogeneous behaviour , whilst a ns ",
    "bh merger produced a much broader spread of fallback activity .",
    "a magnetar can not be formed from a bh , but the same principle of unequal masses can be achieved by a system involving a ns  wd merger , or , with the discovery of increasingly @xcite , possibly a more exotic ns  ns system .",
    "ee grb light curves show a remarkable uniformity when plotted alongside each other , particularly amongst the bursts where redshift is known .",
    "this consistency in plateau luminosity and turnover times suggests ee grbs share a common progenitor mechanism which distinguishes them from ordinary sgrbs .    we have fitted the magnetic dipole spin - down model of @xcite to the late - time data of the light curves of 9 grbs under the assumption that the central engine is a highly magnetized neutron star .",
    "these fits have yielded values for the magnetic field strength and late - time spin period .",
    "we have also performed calculations of the energy contained in the ee region of bursts in this sample . assuming this energy release is due to the spin - down of the central magnetar , and assuming a constant magnetic field",
    ", we infer the spin period these magnetars possessed at birth .",
    "the spin periods found are in good agreement with published values for the birth of a magnetar ( eg @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these results are consistent with the idea that ee grbs could be powered by a spinning - down magnetar .",
