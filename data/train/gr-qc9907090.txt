    "black hole entropy is given by a mysterious formula called the bekenstein - hawking formula  @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is area of the horizon .",
    "there have been many attempts to understand the statistical origin of the black - hole entropy .",
    "entanglement entropy  @xcite is one of the strongest candidates of the origin of black hole entropy .",
    "it is originated from a direct - sum structure of a hilbert space of a quantum system : for an element @xmath2 of the hilbert space @xmath3 of the form @xmath4 the entanglement entropy @xmath5 is defined by @xmath6,\\nonumber\\\\   \\rho_i   & = & { \\bf tr}_{ii}|\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi|.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath7 denotes a tensor product followed by a suitable completion and @xmath8 denotes a partial trace over @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "on the other hand , there is another strong candidate for the origin of black hole entropy : the brick wall model introduced by thooft  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "thermal atmosphere in equilibrium with a black hole is considered . in this situation ,",
    "we encounter with two kinds of divergences in physical quantities .",
    "the first is due to infinite volume of the system and the second is due to infinite blue shift near the horizon .",
    "we are not interested in the first since it represents contribution from matter in the far distance .",
    "hence we introduce an outer boundary in order to make our system finite .",
    "it is the second divergence that we would like to associate with black hole entropy .",
    "namely , it can be shown by introducing a planck scale cutoff that entropy of the thermal atmosphere near the horizon is proportional to the area of the horizon in planck units .    in this paper , we show that the brick wall model seeks the maximal value of the entanglement entropy .",
    "for simplicity , we consider a minimally coupled , real scalar field described by the action @xmath10,\\ ] ] in the spherically symmetric , static black - hole spacetime @xmath11 we denote the area radius of the horizon by @xmath12 and the surface gravity by @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) : @xmath15 we quantize the system of the scalar field with respect to the killing time @xmath16 in a kruskal - like extension of the black hole spacetime .",
    "the corresponding ground state is called the boulware state and its energy density is known to diverge near the horizon .",
    "although we shall only consider states with bounded energy density , it is convenient to express these states as excited states above the boulware ground state for technical reasons . hence , we would like to introduce an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath17 with dimension of length to control the divergence .",
    "the cutoff parameter @xmath17 is implemented so that we only consider two regions satisfying @xmath18 ( shaded regions @xmath19 and @xmath20 in _ figure _  [ fig : kruskal ] ) , where @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) is determined by @xmath23 [ evidently , the limit @xmath24 corresponds to the limit @xmath25 .",
    "thus , in this limit , the whole region in which @xmath26 is timelike is considered . ] strictly speaking , we also have to introduce outer boundaries , say at @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , to control the infinite volume of the constant-@xmath16 surface .",
    "however , even if there are outer boundaries , the following arguments still hold .    [",
    "fig : kruskal ]    in this situation , there is a natural choice for division of the system of the scalar field : let @xmath29 be the space of mode functions with supports in the region @xmath19 and @xmath30 be the space of mode functions with supports in the region @xmath20 .",
    "thence , the space @xmath3 of all states are of the form ( [ eqn : f = f1*f2 ] ) , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are defined as symmetric fock spaces constructed from @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively : @xmath33 here @xmath34 denotes the symmetrization .",
    "let us investigate what kind of condition should be imposed for our arguments to be self - consistent .",
    "a clear condition is that the backreaction of the scalar field to the background geometry should be finite . for the brick wall model",
    "this condition is satisfied .",
    "namely , in ref .  , it was shown that the total mass of the thermal atmosphere of quantum fields is actually bounded .",
    "thus , also for our system , we would like to impose the condition that the contribution @xmath35 of the subsystem @xmath31 to the mass of the background geometry should be bounded in the limit @xmath24 .",
    "it is easily shown that @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the hamiltonian of the subsystem @xmath31 with respect to the killing time @xmath16 .",
    "hence , the expectation value of @xmath35 with respect to a state @xmath2 of the scalar field is decomposed into the contribution of excitations and the contribution from the zero - point energy : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is entanglement energy defined by @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the zero - point energy of the boulware state . here",
    ", the colons denote the usual normal ordering .",
    "[ this definition of entanglement energy corresponds to @xmath42 in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xmath43 in ref .",
    "@xcite . ]",
    "since the boulware energy @xmath41 diverges as @xmath44 in the limit @xmath24  , we should impose the condition @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the area of the horizon , @xmath47 is the hawking temperature .",
    "we would like to call this condition _ the small backreaction condition ( sbc)_. note that the right hand side of sbc ( [ eqn : sbc ] ) is independent of the state @xmath2 .",
    "now , we shall show that the hartle - hawking state is a maximum of the entanglement entropy in the space of quantum states satisfying sbc . for this purpose , we prove a more general statement for a quantum system with a state - space of the form ( [ eqn : f = f1*f2 ] ) : _ a state of the form @xmath48 is a maximum of the entanglement entropy in the space of states with fixed expectation value of the operator @xmath49 defined by @xmath50 provided that the real constant @xmath51 is determined so that the expectation value of @xmath52 is actually the fixed value . here ,",
    "@xmath53 and @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) are bases of the subspaces @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively , and @xmath56 are assumed to be real and non - negative .",
    "_ note that this statement is almost the same as the following statement in statistical mechanics : a canonical state is a maximum of statistical entropy in the space of states with fixed energy , provided that the temperature of the canonical state is determined so that the energy is actually the fixed value .",
    "note that the expectation value of @xmath52 is equal to the entanglement energy ( [ eqn : eent ] ) , providing that @xmath57 and @xmath56 are an eigenstate and an eigenvalue of the normal - ordered hamiltonian @xmath58 of the subsystem @xmath31 .",
    "hence , for the system of the scalar field , the above general statement insists that the state ( [ eqn : hh - state ] ) is a maximum of the entanglement entropy in the space of states satisfying sbc , which corresponds to fixing the entanglement entropy .",
    "off course , in this case , the constant @xmath51 should be determined so that sbc ( [ eqn : sbc ] ) is satisfied .",
    "returning to the subject , let us prove the general statement .",
    "( the following proof is the almost same as that given in the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite for a slightly different statement .",
    "however , for completeness , we shall give the proof . )",
    "first , we decompose an element @xmath2 of @xmath3 as @xmath59 where the coefficients @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) are complex numbers satisfying @xmath62 and can be considered as matrix elements of a matrix @xmath63 . since @xmath64 is a non - negative hermitian matrix , it can be diagonalized as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) and @xmath69 is a unitary matrix . for this decomposition and diagonalization ,",
    "the entanglement entropy and the expectation value of the operator @xmath52 are written as follows .",
    "@xmath70 where @xmath71 is matrix elements of @xmath69 .",
    "the constraints @xmath62 and @xmath72 are equivalent to @xmath73    next , we shall show that these expressions are equivalent to those appearing in statistical mechanics in @xmath31 .",
    "let us consider a density operator @xmath74 on @xmath75 : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a non - negative hermitian matrix with unit trace . by diagonalizing the matrix @xmath78 as @xmath79",
    "we obtain the following expressions for entropy @xmath80 and an expectation value @xmath81 of the operator @xmath82 .",
    "@xmath83 where @xmath84 is the diagonal elements of @xmath85 . the constraints @xmath86 and @xmath87 are restated as @xmath88    from these and those expressions , the following correspondence is easily seen : @xmath89 hence , a maximum of @xmath80 in the space of statistical states with a fixed value of @xmath81 gives a set of maxima of @xmath5 in the space of quantum states with a fixed value of @xmath39 .",
    "( all of them are related by unitary transformations in the subspace @xmath32 . )",
    "thus , since the thermal state @xmath90 is a maximum of @xmath80 in the space of statistical states with a fixed value of @xmath81 , @xmath91 is a maximum of @xmath5 in the space of quantum states with a fixed value of @xmath39 . here",
    "the temperature ( or the constant ) @xmath51 should be determined so that @xmath81 ( or @xmath39 ) has the fixed value .",
    "this completes the proof of the general statement .",
    "therefore , for the system of the scalar field , a state of the form ( [ eqn : hh - state ] ) is a maximum of the entanglement entropy in the space of quantum states satisfying sbc , provided that the constant @xmath51 is determined so that sbc is satisfied .",
    "the value of @xmath51 is easily determined as @xmath92 by using the well - known fact that the negative divergence in the boulware energy density can be canceled by thermal excitations if and only if temperature with respect to the time @xmath16 is equal to the hawking temperature .",
    "finally , we obtain the statement that the hartle - hawking state   is a maximum of entanglement entropy in the space of quantum states satisfying sbc since the hartle - hawking state is actually of the form ( [ eqn : hh - state ] ) with @xmath92  @xcite . [ strictly speaking , in order to obtain the hartle - hawking state , we have to take the limit @xmath24 ( and @xmath93 ) .",
    "however , the following arguments still hold for a finite value of @xmath17 ( and @xmath94 ) . ]",
    "the corresponding reduced density matrix is the thermal state with temperature equal to the hawking temperature .",
    "therefore , the maximal entanglement entropy is equal to the thermal entropy with the hawking temperature , which is sought in the brick wall model .",
    "in summary the brick wall model seeks the maximal value of entanglement entropy .",
    "in other words , the entanglement approach reduces to the brick wall model when we seek the maximal entanglement entropy .",
    "our arguments suggests strong connection among three kinds of thermodynamics : black hole thermodynamics , statistical mechanics , and entanglement thermodynamics  @xcite",
