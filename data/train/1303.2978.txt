    "since the discovery of fe - based high-@xmath0 superconductors @xcite , the symmetry and the gap structure of the superconducting ( sc ) state have been studied very intensively .",
    "it had been established experimentally that @xmath1-wave ( @xmath8 symmetry ) sc state is realized in usual fe - based superconductors .",
    "the gap structure in many optimally - doped high-@xmath0 compounds is nearly isotropic and fully - gapped @xcite , although some compounds show accidental nodal gap structure . in the phase diagram , the sc phase is realized next to the orthorhombic structure transition at @xmath9 , and the magnetic order is also realized at @xmath10 . below @xmath9 , the orbital polarization @xmath11",
    "is realized @xcite , and sizable softening of shear modulus @xmath12 @xcite indicates the development of orbital fluctuations near the orthorhombic phase .",
    "strong spin fluctuations are also observed near the magnetic ordered phase .",
    "these observed orbital and spin quantum criticalities have been intensively studied theoretically , since they would be closely connected to the pairing mechanism . within the random - phase - approximation ( rpa ) ,",
    "strong spin fluctuations develop in the multiorbital hubbard models for fe - based superconductors .",

    "also , orbital - fluctuation - mediated @xmath1-wave state without sign reversal ( @xmath13-wave state ) is realized by introducing the quadrupole interaction @xmath14 due to fe - ion oscillations @xcite . even for @xmath15 ,",
    "strong orbital fluctuations are obtained by improving the rpa by including the vertex correction ( vc ) for the susceptibility that is dropped in the rpa @xcite : since spin and orbital fluctuations mutually develop in the self - consistent vc method , both @xmath16-wave and @xmath13-wave states can be obtained by solving the multiorbital hubbard model .    to distinguish between these two sc gap states ,",
    "various phase - sensitive experiments had been performed @xcite .",

    "another important finding in fig .",
    "[ fig : r - tmat ] ( a ) is that the value of @xmath209 in the five - orbital model is approximately independent of the impurity potential strength ( in both born and unitary regimes ) , for all the impurity models studied here .",
    "this fact means that the  constant @xmath27-model can be applicable only for born impurities , as we will discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : senga - dis ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : r - tmat ] ( a ) , the values of @xmath138 for @xmath47- and @xmath150-models apparently deviate from the @xmath210 line .",
    "this fact originates from the large contribution from the cvc , which becomes important when the impurity potential has finite scattering cross section , since the forward impurity scattering is correctly subtracted by taking the cvc into account .",
    "in fact , as shown in fig . [",
    "fig : r - tmat ] ( b ) , the relation @xmath211 is apparently improved by neglecting the cvc .",
    "therefore , we should take the cvc into account to obtain quantitatively reliable value of @xmath138 , especially for wide - range impurity potentials .",
    "in the previous section , we calculated the impurity effect on the @xmath2-wave state for various non - local impurity models .",

    "moreover , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : r - v1 ] ( a ) , @xmath138 is strongly enlarged by introducing the no - site potential @xmath46 , which should be much larger than @xmath47 in magnitude in real impurities .    by introducing @xmath47 the electron number at the nn site of the impurity center is changed by @xmath215 for @xmath216 , according to the analysis of the present five - orbital tight - binding model . however , according to the first principle study @xcite , @xmath217 would be at most @xmath218 , meaning that @xmath162 due to the strong screening effect in real compounds . therefore , the effect of @xmath47 would be negligible in the study of the impurity effect in fe - based superconductors .",
    "we have shown in fig . [",
    "fig : r - tmat ] that the relation @xmath219 holds in some non - local impurity potentials .",
    "to understand the reason , we consider a orbital - less square lattice model for simplicity . in the born approximation ,",
    "the @xmath52-matrix for the @xmath47-model is given as @xmath220 where @xmath221 is the green function in real space at @xmath222 .",
    "the cosine terms in eq .",

    "( [ eqn : t - kp ] ) gives @xmath227 .",
    "therefore , the relation @xmath219 would be possible when @xmath228 .      in this paper , we analyzed the impurity effect based on the realistic five - orbital model with non - local impurity potentials .",

    ", we discuss both the usefulness and limitations of the latter model , in which the impurity potential in the band - basis ( @xmath187 , @xmath229 ) is given as @xmath230 . if we assume @xmath28 and @xmath29 are constant , then we obtain @xmath231 where @xmath232 ( @xmath233 ) is inter - band ( intra - band ) @xmath52-matrix . here ,",
    "@xmath234 , and @xmath235 is the density - of - states for each band . in the born regime @xmath236 , then @xmath237 holds , and therefore the @xmath16-wave state is fragile against impurities except when @xmath238 .    in the unitary regime @xmath239 , the @xmath16-wave state is robust against impurities unless @xmath240 since eq .",
    "( [ eqn : r - constanti ] ) decreases in proportion to @xmath241 .",
