    "<S> much is known in the cases when @xmath6 and @xmath7 are of the same sign@xcite , corresponding to the ferromagnetic potts model ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) and the antiferromagnetic potts model ( @xmath10 , @xmath11)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> much less is known in the mixed interaction case , @xmath8 and @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> this will be the object of this letter .    </S>",
    "<S> there have been a number of attempts to study the mixed interaction model , particularly for the case @xmath1@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> kinzel , selke and wu@xcite obtained a candidate critical line by applying a one step migdal - kadanoff procedure , thereby mapping the model onto the ferromagnetic potts model for which the exact expression for the critical line is known . </S>",
    "<S> this gave the critical line as @xmath12 spurred on by the fact that this line is exact for the exactly known @xmath13 case , it was suggested that perhaps this equation may remain exact for other values of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> they also gave numerical results from monte carlo simulations which suggest a transition line at lower temperatures than given by . </S>",
    "<S> the transition line was estimated , however , by extrapolating the inverse correlation lengths by hand to zero for lattice sizes less than about 60 .    </S>",
    "<S> the possibility that may correspond to an exact result was refuted by the observation that , except for @xmath13 , this line does not remain invariant under the symmetries of the model@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetries of the model may be used to construct a symmetry group@xcite . the critical line must remain invariant under the action of these symmetries . using the group of symmetries of the model , </S>",
    "<S> truong@xcite constructed extended duality relations which he used to look for candidate critical lines . for the 3-state potts model this gave : @xmath14 interestingly , this line has the same functional form as the ferromagnetic transition line but with @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> this line is indeed invariant under all the symmetries of the model , but does not seem to correspond to the transition line when compared with numerical results of kinzel @xcite , yasumura@xcite and of the present work . </S>",
    "<S> this leaves the interesting question : does this very special line have a corresponding physical meaning ? </S>",
    "<S> this question remains open .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been conjectured that the transition for @xmath1 is of kosterlitz - thouless type . </S>",
    "<S> this conjecture is based on the free - fermion approximation applied to a related clock - model@xcite , and supported by numerical results on a related one dimensional quantum potts model@xcite . in this letter we present convincing evidence that the transition for @xmath1 is indeed of the kosterlitz - thouless type . </S>",
    "<S> the critical exponent @xmath16 is given as a function of @xmath0 and shown to diverge at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the critical temperatures are also given , as a function of @xmath0 , for the case @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> no transition is found for @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this work provides a more accurate estimate of the critical line for @xmath1 , which is substantially lower than previous estimates@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results were obtained using the numerical transfer matrix method coupled with phenomenological renormalisation@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the method consists of expressing the partition function of an infinite strip of finite width @xmath18 in terms of a matrix product . </S>",
    "<S> imposing periodic boundary conditions in the transfer direction ( along the direction taken to be infinite ) , the partition function for the strip may be written @xmath19 the thermodynamic limit corresponds to the limit @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> for integer values of @xmath21 it is possible to write the transfer matrices directly in terms of spins . </S>",
    "<S> full details are given in foster , grard and puha@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for non - integer values of @xmath0 it is necessary to use the kasteleyn - fortuin mapping@xcite , which gives the potts model in terms of bond - clusters on the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> full details on the construction of the transfer matrices for this case are given in blte and nightingale@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it may be shown that the correlation length in the transfer direction is given by @xmath22 assuming scale invariance at the critical point , finite size estimates of the critical temperature may be identified with solutions of the equation @xmath23 the critical exponent @xmath16 may be estimated at the fixed points , solutions of , by @xmath24     for a transfer direction along ( a ) the @xmath25-direction and ( b ) the @xmath26-direction . </S>",

    "<S> on the other hand , @xmath27 increases with @xmath18 in the second . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates a value of @xmath0 , @xmath28 , such that there exists a critical phase transition for @xmath29 , but not for @xmath30 . </S>",
