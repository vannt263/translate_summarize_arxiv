    "given two @xmath0 point sets in the plane , it is an open question as to whether a compatible triangulation exists between them .",
    "this problem was first posed by aichholzer et al.@xcite in 2002 and in a slightly different version by saalfeld @xcite in 1987 .",
    "aronov , seidel , and souvaine @xcite studied the related problem of compatibly triangulating simple polygons and showed that @xmath1 steiner points were necessary in some cases .",
    "an immediate corollary of euler s theorem states that the number of triangles in any triangulation of a set @xmath2 with @xmath0 points is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the convex hull of @xmath2 .",
    "trivially , two triangulations must have the same number of triangles to be compatible so it is a necessary condition for a compatible triangulation that the point sets have the same number of extreme points .",
    "aichholzer et al .",
    "conjecture that this condition is also sufficient .",
    "they also show that compatible triangulations , for sets obeying these necessary conditions , are always possible if one is allowed to add extra points , called _ steiner _",
    "points , to the sets . the number of steiner points required by aichholzer et al .  is equal to the number of interior points of the set minus three .    in this paper ,",
    "an improved method is given for obtaining compatible triangulations using steiner points .",
    "this method requires the use of a number of steiner points approximately equal to half the number of points in the set .",
    "though finding compatible triangulations requires the number of convex hull points to be the same in each set , this technique makes no assumptions about the convex hulls of the point sets .",
    "the added points increase the radii of the point sets by a constant factor .",
    "the method also allows for great control over the structure of the steiner point triangulation .",
    "furthermore , the question of finding @xmath5-way compatible triangulations is introduced and explored .",
    "this natural generalization of the problem asks how @xmath5 distinct triangulations can be triangulated so that the resulting triangulations are pairwise compatible .",
    "we show that for @xmath6 , there are exist @xmath5 sets of @xmath0 points which _ require _ steiner points in order to yield a compatible triangulation .",
    "the steiner point method for the @xmath7 case extends for @xmath8 , producing a technique for @xmath5-way compatible triangulation using a number of added points which is surprisingly independent of @xmath5 .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    a _ triangulation _ of a set @xmath2 of points in the plane @xmath9 , denoted by @xmath10 , is a maximal set of line segments between the points such that any pair of segments intersect at one endpoint or not at all .",

    ", where no three points of @xmath2 are collinear .",

    "the points of @xmath2 that lie on the boundary of the convex hull are the _ extreme points _ , and the remaining points of @xmath2 are called _ interior points_.    [ d : comp1 ] given two point sets @xmath2 and @xmath11 with @xmath12 , along with triangulations @xmath10 and @xmath13 , we say @xmath10 and @xmath13 are _ compatible _ if there exists a bijection @xmath14 such that @xmath15 is a clockwise - oriented triangle of @xmath10 if and only if @xmath16 is a clockwise - oriented triangle of @xmath13 .",
    "the term _ joint triangulation _ is also used in the literature to describe the same object .",
    "there are variants of this definition which omit the requirement regarding orientation , requiring only that the bijection maps empty triangles to empty triangles .",
    "we have chosen the above definition because it is more useful for applications in computer graphics and cartography .",
    "it is important to note that none of these definitions require only the underlying graph structures of the triangulations to be isomorphic .",

    "one might try methods of compatible triangulation using exterior steiner points , that is , additional points added outside of the convex hull of the original point set .",
    "we show a method of doing this that uses a number of steiner points independent of the size of the point sets to be triangulated .",

    "the preceding theorem demonstrates the power of adding exterior steiner points .",

    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    in order to construct compatible steiner point triangulations , it is helpful to break the problem into smaller pieces . one way is to lay down the steiner points so that a triangulation of the steiner points alone divides the original point sets into smaller point sets in each triangle",
    "this only works if the triangulations on the steiner points are compatible and the same number of points fall in corresponding triangles . in this section",
    "we show this is always possible .",
    "recall that definition  [ d : comp2 ] states that compatibility is just a convex hull preserving isomorphism .",
    "therefore , in order to add steiner points that can be compatibly triangulated , we view these triangulations as two embeddings of the same graph in which the same vertices map to the convex hull in the same orientation .",
    "the graphs used to perform this desired partition all have a common structure .",
