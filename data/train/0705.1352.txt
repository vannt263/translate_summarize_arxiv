    "<S> we study the evolution and saturation of the gluon distribution function in the quark - gluon plasma as probed by a propagating parton and its effect on the computation of jet quenching or transport parameter @xmath0 . for thermal partons , </S>",
    "<S> the saturation scale @xmath1 is found to be proportional to the debye screening mass @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> for hard probes , evolution at small @xmath3 leads to jet energy dependence of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we study this dependence for both a conformal gauge theory in weak and strong coupling limit and for ( pure gluon ) qcd . the energy dependence can be used to extract the shear viscosity @xmath4 of the medium since @xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> can be related to the transport parameter for thermal partons in a transport description . </S>",
    "<S> we also derive upper bounds on the transport parameter for both energetic and thermal partons . </S>",
    "<S> the latter leads to a lower bound on shear viscosity - to - entropy density ratio which is consistent with the conjectured lower bound @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the implications on the study of jet quenching at the bnl relativistic heavy ion collider and the cern large hadron collider and the bulk properties of the dense matter . </S>"
