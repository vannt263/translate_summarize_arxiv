    "qcd simulations @xcite , which are very reliable at @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath5 greater than top sps energies , the dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath4 appears very close to the qcd critical line . at larger @xmath4 ( lower energies ) , both boundaries become distinguishable @xcite . in this region ,",
    "lattice qcd simulations suffer from serious numerical difficulties ( the so - called sign problem ) .",
    "thus , we are left with effective models such as statistical - thermal models and qcd - like approaches including linear - sigma and nambu - jona - lasinio models .",
    "so far , there are various phenomenological proposals suggesting universal conditions describing the chemical freezeout boundary . for a recent review ,",
    "the readers are kindly advised to consult ref .",
    "recently , the possible interrelations among the various freezeout conditions have been derived @xcite .    while the region of the high temperature and low baryonic density at the qcd phase - diagram are explored by the experiments of the rhic and the lhc , the region of relatively low and intermediate energy",

    "the convincing agreement between urqmd simulated and experimental parameters encourages us to extend the study to the other beam energies through urqmd simulations lower down to @xmath12 gev , in which the baryon density likely reaches its maximum and shall be covered by nica and fair future facilities .",
    "it is obvious that hrg is an effective statistical model which is only applicable to the produced particles in their final stages of the temporal and spatial evolution of the high - energy collision .",

    "as mentioned , different numerical methods and algorithms seems to fail while trying to reproduce even the well - identified particles ( low - lying states , such as pions , kaons and protons ) at very low beam energies or equivalently very large baryon chemical potentials . in this energy limit ,",
    "some particle species ca nt be accessed .",
    "this becomes illustrated in section [ results ] , especially fig .",
    "[ fig : firstorder ] . in general , the hrg model is a very powerful statistical approach . in spite of its simplicity , it finds so - far a wide range of implications , especially in describing various aspects of the lattice qcd thermodynamics and the particle production in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the latter are limited to the final state , post the chemical freezeout era .",
    "all prior eras of the relativistic collision are not accessible by the hrg model .",
    "these would be subject to transport approaches .",
    "the urqmd characterizes almost the entire evolution of the colliding system from very early stages up to the particle production , including hydrodynamical evolution and particlization .",
    "this _ transport _ approach will be elaborated in the section that follows .",
    "the urqmd event - generator @xcite is a well - known simulation approach enabling the characterization of high - energy collisions .",
    "it simulates the phase space of such collisions and implements a large set of monte carlo solutions for a large number of paired partial - differential equations describing the evolution of phase space densities .",
    "the urqmd model simulates the development of the colliding system from a possibly very early stage ( depending on the chosen configuration ) up to the final state of the particle production .",
    "its large number of unknown parameters could be fixed from experimental results and by theoretical assumptions . in the present calculations , we use hybrid urqmd  v.@xmath36",
    "@xcite which has been tested and give reasonable results in the energy range from @xmath37agev in standard parameter calculations .",
    "furthermore , hybrid urqmd v@xmath1 provides the possibility to use two types of the phase transition ; first order and crossover .",
    "this allows us the study of the possible effects of the hadronization processes on the final - state particle production .     in hybrid urqmd @xmath1 , for case the of crossover",
    ", the equation of state ( eos ) for the fluid dynamical evolution is borrowed from the su(@xmath12 ) parity doublet model in which quark degrees - of - freedom besides the thermal contribution of the polyakov loop are included @xcite .",
    "this eos qualitatively agrees with the lattice qcd results at vanishing baryon chemical potential and - most importantly - is conjectured to be applicable at finite baryon chemical potentials , as well . for first - order phase transition , an eos from su(@xmath38 )",
    "bag model is to be included . by the end of the hydrodynamical evolution , the active eos",
    "is changed to the one characterizing the hadron gas .",
    "accordingly , it is assured that the active degrees - of - freedom on both sides of the transition hypersurface are exactly equivalent @xcite .",
    "for the first order phase transition in urqmd  v.@xmath39 is used the approach proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the nuclear matter is described by a @xmath40-type model for the hadron matter phase and by the mit bag model for the quark - gluon plasma , with a first order phase transition between both phases .    for the sake of completeness",
    ", we emphasize that two differences between crossover and first - order phase transitions are the latent heat and the degrees of freedom . in first - order phase transition both",
    "are larger than that in crossover .",
    "furthermore , the crossover takes place smoothly , i.e. , a relative wide range of temperatures is needed to convert the qcd matter from pure hadron to parton matter or vice versa , while there is a prompt jump in case of first - order phase transition , i.e. , the critical temperature becomes very sharp @xcite .    as a limitation ,",
    "there is some influence of a mere technical aspect of urqmd to its physical outcome . when the program switches from the hydrodynamical treatment of the high - density stage of the hadronic medium back to the _",
    "`` normal '' _ particle - based transport code , there might occur some bias to the resulting particle statistics @xcite .",
    "because we selected the same particlization procedure in both cases , the differences of particle ratios between first order and crossover phase might appear smaller than implied by the physical model .",
    "particles ratios in this work are studied at the energies @xmath41 and @xmath13gev . the energies @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath13gev are the part of the star bes program and for these energies exist also comparable measurements from experiments of the superproton synchrotron ( sps ) , such as na49 , na44 , and na57 @xcite .",

    "so , influence of this criterion will be the subject for the next investigations .",
    "when we determine the freezeout parameters from the statistical fits of the hrg calculations to the _ measured _ particle ratios and when we compare them with the fits to urqmd , we observe that the first ones are relatively higher .",
    "this might be due to the assumptions that the constituents of the hrg model are point - like , i.e. , no excluded - volume corrections were taken into account , and the quark occupation factors are unity , i.e. , light and strange quarks equilibrium , i.e. , @xmath86 factors , where @xmath87 runs over the quark flavors , which are multiplied by the quark occupation parameters @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ grindeq2 ] ) . at equilibrium , they are omitted as their values are unity . in nonequilibrium , the quark occupation factors should be stated .",
    "ten particle ratios are generated from the hybrid urqmd v.@xmath1 at different nucleon - nucleon center - of - mass energies .",
    "two types of the quark - hadron phase - transition ; crossover and first - order , are taken into consideration .",
    "the energy - dependence of the resulting particle ratios is compared with the hrg calculations and different measured results from the star experiments and from the urqmd model . within the energy - range considered in this study , a good agreement",
    "is observed , at least qualitatively .",
    "we observe that almost all particle ratios from both types of phase transition are nearly indistinguishable , especially at lower energies ( larger baryon chemical potentials ) , which might be interpreted in such a way that the chemical freezeout , at which the particle number should be fixed , apparently takes place immediately after the hadronization process and accordingly the particle production at this chemical equilibrium stage does not differ with respect to its origin .",
    "concretely , we find that for some particle ratios , the simulations with crossover phase transition result in slightly higher temperatures if crossover phase transition is considered than the ones in first - order and vice versa in other ratios .",
    "all particle - to - antiparticle ratios are regularly resulting in slightly higher temperatures for crossover phase transition .",
    "for these ratios , the agreement between urqmd or hrg calculations and their measurements is fairly good .    from the energy dependence of the urqmd particle ratios and",
    "the conclusion that the hrg model qualitatively reproduces them and the star measurements , as well , we have deduced both freezeout parameters . in doing this , we assume that the urqmd simulations are experimental inputs .",
    "the corresponding uncertainty is determined by statistical errors .",
    "we have determined the freezeout parameters at star bes ; @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath13gev , whose particle ratios are found compatible with the urqmd simulations with the crossover phase transition .",
    "the resulting freezeout parameters agree well with the ones determined from the statistical - thermal fits of star particle ratios at these given energies .",
    "it is found that the resulting freezeout parameters from hybrid urqmd agree well with the hrg calculations , in which higher - order moments of the net - proton multiplicity are utilized .",
    "furthermore , the freezeout temperatures deduced from the su(@xmath12 ) plsm are slightly lower that the ones from both of them .",
    "we conclude that the resulting freezeout parameters are not influenced by the order of the quark - hadron phase transition  or that the aforementioned particlization bias has a possible small influence .",
    "the hrg freezeout parameters determined from the statistical fit of the _ measured _ particle ratios are relatively higher .",
    "this might be understood due to the assumption of point - like constituents and equilibrium light- and strange - quarks occupation factors assumed in the hrg model .",
    "furthermore , the parton - hadron - string dynamics ( phsd ) @xcite and the three - fluid hydrodynamics ( 3fh ) @xcite are conjectured as alternatives to perform much better than urqmd at low energies , towards the nica energy range . in a future study , we plan to compare between all these approaches at nica energies .",
