    "although very few magnetic systems can be solved exactly in three dimensions , there is a reasonable understanding of the physics of simple systems without competing interactions .",
    "numerical estimates for physical quantities exist to at least the accuracy that experiments currently attain .",
    "many systems do exhibit competing interactions however , that is interactions that do not all favour the same ordered state . sufficiently strong competition can lead to new physics which is manifested by the appearance of non - collinear ordering , novel critical exponents , rich phase diagrams , or an absence of long range order at low temperatures .",
    "there are several ways in which frustration can arise . in this article attention",
    "is limited to geometric frustration arising from triangular arrangements of magnetic moments with each pair coupled antiferromagnetically .",
    "figure  1a shows such a situation with three atoms forming an equilateral triangle .",
    "atoms 1 and 2 form a state of lowest energy when their moments are aligned antiparallel , but then atom 3 can not align itself simultaneously antiparallel to the moment on both atoms 1 and 2 , so it is frustrated .",
    "this frustration is most severe for an ising system where spins can align only in one direction . for classical vector spins confined to the plane of the paper ( xy interactions )",
    "there are two degenerate solutions for the lowest energy of the system for a given spin vector at atom  1 .",
    "these are shown in figures  1b and 1c .",
    "both have the three spin vectors at @xmath0 to each other , and the degeneracy corresponds to two different chiral states .",
    "the overall degeneracy of the ground state involves the product of this state and orientation of spin  1 in the plane ; this corresponds to the group @xmath1 . for three dimensional vector spins and isotropic heisenberg interactions",
    "the degeneracy is greater still since the spin on atom 1 can be in any direction and then the spins on atoms 2 and 3 can be in any plane which contains the direction of spin 1.this degeneracy corresponds to the group so(3 ) .",
    "if the hamiltonian has easy axis anisotropy , the plane of the three spins will contain the z axis and the angle between the three spin vectors will no longer be 120@xmath2 .",
    "a general feature of these frustrated systems is that the ground state has extra degeneracy over and above that found in the analogous non - frustrated systems .",
    "this is what gives rises to the possibility of new physics .",
    "there are several ways that triangles of antiferromagnetic interactions can be built into a crystal lattice . in this article",
    "we limit consideration to the effects of frustration in the stacked triangular lattice .",
    "this is a lattice containing two - dimensional triangular sheets coupled by antiferromagnetic interactions @xmath3 , with the sheets stacked perpendicular to the plane with coupling @xmath4 between neighbouring atoms in different planes .",
    "almost all the work on this lattice involves one of two crystal structures , one with composition abx@xmath5 where a is an alkali metal , b is a transition metal , and x is a halogen atom , and the other with composition bx@xmath6 .",
    "the crystal structure of these materials is shown in figure 2 . .",
    "in abx@xmath5 compounds there are chains of magnetic b atoms along the z direction coupled by superexchange interactions through three equivalent anions x. there is no direct superexchange coupling between atoms on neighbouring chains .",
    "the magnitude of the interplanar interactions @xmath4 is typically two to three orders of magnitude greater than intraplanar interactions @xmath3 , so that at high temperatures the magnetic properties become quasi one dimensional . in bx@xmath6 compounds",
    "the strong superexchange coupling is intraplanar and the ratio of the magnitude of the interactions is reversed . at high temperatures the magnetic properties are quasi two dimensional . in a third known type of triangular antiferromagnets , abo@xmath6 compounds , the stacking of two - dimensional triangular sheets along the z direction is different from abx@xmath5 and bx@xmath6 compounds , the stacking sequence is rhombohedral of abcabcabc ... type .",
    "the crystal structure dictates strong two dimensional character of magnetic system in abo@xmath6 compounds : the exchange path of the interplane interaction @xmath3 , b ",
    "o  a  o  b , is much longer than that of the intraplane interaction @xmath4 , b  b and b  o  b . at low temperatures",
    "almost all mentioned above materials form three - dimensional ordered magnetic structures that indicate the presence of magnetic frustration in the triangular lattice . in many ,",
    "though not all , cases the low temperature structure is built from one of the structures shown in figure  1 .",
    "kawamura @xcite predicted that the extra degeneracy in the ground state of triangular antiferromagnets leads to new physics , which can be described in terms of universality classes based on the symmetry of the order parameter .",
    "monte carlo work  @xcite supports kawamura s prediction for heisenberg symmetry as does 4-@xmath7 renormalization group calculations @xcite .",
    "however the non - linear @xmath8 model in 2+@xmath7 dimensions@xcite indicates non - universal behavior , likely with mean - field tricritical exponents , and 3d renormalization group calculations with a resummation technique show a first - order phase transition  @xcite .",
    "the situation is no less clear for xy symmetry .",
    "experimentally stacked triangular antiferromagnets are found to have critical phase transitions with critical exponents that do not correspond to any of the standard universality classes for both heisenberg @xcite and xy @xcite symmetry .",
    "in fact the critical points are found to be tetracritical in character @xcite so that they clearly can not belong in the same universality class as unfrustrated systems .",
    "this shows that the physics of magnetic systems can be changed by frustration .",
    "both experiment and theory indicate that the ordered states found at low temperatures in frustrated systems have reduced ordered moments .",
    "any detailed theory must therefore include quantum effects in determining the ground state , and classical theory may be substantially in error .    in fact much of the physics of the stacked triangular lattice is similar to that predicted for the two - dimensional triangular lattice  @xcite and the presence of the third dimension is not an essential ingredient of most of the ideas that are used in the field .",
    "however , for all well - characterized materials which have triangular magnetic lattices , the long - range order at low temperatures is three - dimensional in nature . for nearest-heis.texneighbour ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic interactions , there is no extra frustration involved by going to three dimensions , and the main influence of the presence of the third dimension is that the two - dimensional ordering process is stabilized .    in this article",
    "we describe in some detail the magnetic properties of materials with stacked triangular lattices , paying special attention to cases where there are novel physical phenomena absent in the unfrustrated case .",
    "emphasis is placed on the experimental results , though where possible the discussion is put in the appropriate theoretical context .",

    "the stacked triangular magnetic lattice is shown in figure  3 .",
    "its magnetic properties for heisenberg - type antiferromagnetism with single - ion anisotropy can be descibed on the basis of the following hamiltonian : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a spin of the magnetic ion , @xmath4 is the exchange integral along the @xmath11 axis of the crystal , @xmath3 is the exchange integral in the perpendicular direction , @xmath12 is the anisotropy constant , whose sign determines the orientation of the spin plane relative to the crystal axes .",
    "the first sum describes the exchange energy along the chain , the second sum describes the exchange energy in the basal plane , and the third and fourth sums represent the single - ion anisotropy energy and the zeeman energy of the spins in a external magnetic field @xmath13 respectively .",

    "all real triangular magnets have non zero @xmath12 , but if @xmath15 is small compared with both @xmath16 and @xmath17 the magnetic properties will be close to those of heisenberg systems except at very low temperatures @xmath18 or very close to the critical point .",
    "if @xmath19 the ground state in zero field has spins confined to the @xmath20 plane and in the critical region the fluctuations will only diverge for spin components within the @xmath20 plane .",
    "if @xmath21 the anisotropy energy will be minimised for spins aligned perpendicular to the @xmath20 plane . this term will compete with the antiferromagnetic @xmath3 exchange term and lead to additional frustration .",

    "there are two phase transitions , a critical transition at 16.3  k and a first - order transition at 14.4  k @xcite .",
    "vcl@xmath6 has weak easy - axis anisotropy as is shown by the data in table  [ heis_parameters ] and also by the splitting of the critical point from the single tetracritical point of the frustrated heisenberg hamiltonian into two ordinary critical transitions at @xmath27  k and at @xmath28  k in zero field @xcite .",
    "this splitting of about one part in 450 will give rise to crossover behaviour in the critical region @xcite .",
    "for reduced temperatures @xmath29 of magnitude more than about 1/450 above @xmath30 or below @xmath31 the critical behaviour will be that of the frustrated heisenberg system .",
    "nearer to @xmath30 or @xmath31 the critical behaviour will reflect the fact that the correlation length only diverges along the @xmath32 direction , not in the xy plane , and will be different .",
    "thus it is possible in principle to measure three sets of critical exponents in vcl@xmath6 , though in practice only the heisenberg exponents for @xmath33 have been measured . in vbr@xmath6",

    "on the other hand , absence of splitting of @xmath25 and of anisotropy in the susceptibility above @xmath25 demonstrate that magnetic anisotropy @xmath12 is much smaller than exchange interactions @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",

    "the ratio @xmath45 could also be estimated from susceptibility measurements since it is proportional to the @xmath46=5% ratio ( note the difference between licro@xmath6 and vx@xmath6 compounds : in licro@xmath6 @xmath47 ) .",
    "the optical and esr measurements were mostly devoted to the problem of finding of the characteristic point - defects known as @xmath48 vortices , predicted theoretically by kawamura and miyashita  @xcite .",

    "an interesting issue is a magnetic moment reduction at low temperature .",
    "there are three general reasons which effect the value of magnetic moments in abx@xmath5 and vx@xmath6 compounds : 1 ) covalency reduction , 2 ) effect of frustration and 3 ) quantum fluctuations enhanced by low - dimensionality of the magnetic system . according to high temperature susceptibility measurements @xcite , the moment of v@xmath52",
    "can be estimated as 3.96 , 4.07 and 4.07  @xmath53 for vcl@xmath6 , vbr@xmath6 and vi@xmath6 respectively , suggesting small covalency reduction . from the low - temperature neutron diffraction data an average moment in vcl@xmath6 is @xmath54 @xcite , and in vbr@xmath6 @xmath55 or @xmath56 depending upon magnetic structure assumed @xcite .",
    "the relatively small reduction of the magnetic moment in the two - dimensional systems in comparison with almost 50% reduction in some abx@xmath5 one - dimensional systems ( see next section ) indicates dimensionality ( quasi - two - dimensional rather than quasi - one - dimensional ) and quantum fluctuations are the major influences on the moment reduction in the stacked triangular lattice .",
    "note , that in theory an average magnetic moment of two - dimensional magnetic system is nonzero , while in one - dimensional system @xmath57 .",
    "in this section we describe materials with a hamiltonian ( equation [ h_h ] ) that has an exchange term and a single - ion anisotropy with @xmath21 .",
    "this negative value of @xmath12 makes it energetically favourable for the moments to align perpendicular to the @xmath58 plane .",
    "this breaks the isotropic symmetry of the heisenberg hamiltonian and leads to changes in the physics .",
    "there are five materials with this hamiltonian , all of composition abx@xmath5 , with space group @xmath59 and a stacked triangular lattice of spins .",
    "these are csnicl@xmath5 , rbnicl@xmath5 , csnibr@xmath5 , rbnibr@xmath5 and csmni@xmath5 .",
    "all exhibit the quasi - one - dimensional behaviour typical of this crystal structure with the value of the exchange interaction , @xmath4 , along @xmath11 more than an order of magnitude greater than the intra - planar exchange interaction , @xmath60 , and with the magnitude of @xmath12 of the same order as that of @xmath60 .",
    "experimental values of @xmath4 , @xmath60 and @xmath12 were given in table [ heis_parameters ] .",
    "in all cases the exchange interaction is antiferromagnetic . in some cases there",
    "are major discrepancies between experimental results ; we will look at this later in this section .",
    "all five materials have a magnetic phase diagram as shown in figure  4 . at low temperatures and magnetic fields the magnetic structure",
    "is observed to be the triangular structure with the @xmath11 axis in the plane of the triangle .",
    "the anisotropy favours alignment of spins perpendicular to the basal plane resulting in structures where the angle @xmath61 in the figure is less than 60@xmath62 .",
    "each @xmath58 plane has a net moment perpendicular to it which can be observed by neutron diffraction .",
    "however the planes are stacked antiferromagnetically because of the large antiferromagnet exchange interaction , @xmath4 , along the chains .",
    "this results in the whole crystal being an antiferromagnet . for a classical system @xmath63 at @xmath64",
    "the triangular structure collapses into a collinear structure with two spins along @xmath65 and one spin along @xmath66 .",
    "the anisotropy is not large enough for this to happen in any of the materials considered in this section .",
    "chapter  [ ising ] describes collapsed cases .    at a temperature @xmath31",
    "there is a critical phase transition to the colinear structure as shown in figure  4 .",
    "thus for classical spins , as @xmath67 increases to 3@xmath3 , @xmath31 decreases to zero . at a higher temperature , @xmath68",
    ", there is a second critical phase transition , this time to the paramagnetic state .",
    "the difference @xmath69 is a measure of the relative strength of the anisotropy , @xmath12 , and the exchange , @xmath3 .",
    "the colinear structure has energy independent of applied field , while for all the competing structures the energy decreases as the field increases .",
    "thus it becomes less stable as the field increases .    as a field",
    "is applied along the @xmath11 axis at low temperature the angle @xmath61 changes in different directions for successive planes ; in the plane shown in figure  4 the angle @xmath61 increases on application of a field along @xmath32 . at a field @xmath70",
    "there is a first - order phase transition to the canted structure shown in figure  4 . in this structure",
    "the @xmath20 component of the moments form an equilateral triangle , while the @xmath32 components are aligned ferromagnetically along the field direction . for a classical system with @xmath4 large compared with @xmath3 or @xmath67 , tanaka _ et al . _ @xcite show that @xmath71 at @xmath72 .",
    "it should be noted that the expression given by tanaka _",
    "_ differs from that given above by a factor of 2 because they define @xmath4 to be half of our @xmath4 .",
    "there is a multicritical point at @xmath73 , @xmath74 where all four phases meet .",
    "alternatively , this point can be described as the intersection of three lines of critical phase transitions and one line of first - order phase transitions .",
    "the experimentally - determined parameters of the phase diagram , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath73 , @xmath70 , @xmath74 and @xmath61 are given in table  [ hea_tab ] .",
    "there is reasonable agreement between different experimental measurements here , in contrast to the descrepancies noted between some of the measurements of the parameters of the hamiltonian ( table  [ heis_parameters ] ) .",
    "now that we have given an overview of the properties of materials with easy - axis anisotropy , we go back to examining the experimental values of the parameters in the hamiltonian , and to checking consistency with phase - diagram parameters .",
    "one reason for inconsistency is that it is believed that the neutron scattering values of -13.0  ghz for csnicl@xmath5 and -0.5 for csmni@xmath5 are in error because of incorrect branch assignments .",
    "a second problem is that the resonance experiments actually measure @xmath70 and then derive @xmath12 from equation [ hc ] and known values of @xmath4 .",
    "unfortunately the equation may not hold for @xmath75 .",
    "the difficulty arises from the need to incorporate quantum fluctuations into the theory .",
    "a well - established technique for taking these into account involves an expansion in powers of @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "zhitomirsky and zaliznyak @xcite show that inclusion of this term in equation [ hc ] yields a negative value for @xmath77 .",
    "although this is non - physical , the result serves notice that equation [ hc ] is not good for values of @xmath78 as small as 1 .",
    "furthermore the first term in the quantum correction for @xmath75 renormalizes @xmath4 by 18@xmath79 and @xmath12 by -50@xmath79 .",
    "most experiments will measure the renormalized values , not the bare values .",
    "a further difficulty with the nickel compounds is that because of their quasi - one - dimensional properties , there may be vestiges of the haldane effect in their low - temperature properties .",
    "of course a full quantum treatment will take this into account , but it may not be apparent in the first term of a @xmath76 expansion .",
    "several neutron scattering experiments claim to see haldane - gap effects in the three - dimensional ordered phase @xcite and conventional spin - wave theory ( i.e. spin - wave theory without quantum corrections ) does not fit the measured dispersion relations . without further theoretical guidance",
    "there must be some doubts about the reported values of @xmath4 , @xmath3 and @xmath12 for the nickel compounds even in cases where the experimental data is irreproachable .",
    "affleck@xcite has argued haldane correlations will still be effective in the three - dimensionally ordered phase .",
    "his treatment shows much better qualitative agreement with experiment than linear spin - wave theory and provides a theoretical underpinning for the claims that the experiments constitute solid confirmation of the existence of the haldane gap . in large fields , @xmath80 and @xmath73 , the quantum fluctuations are reduced!@xcite and the interpretational difficulties are less severe .    in csmni@xmath5",
    "the quantum corrections are smaller ; in leading order by a factor of 2.5 so that they are of the same order as the experimental uncertainties .",
    "the spin wave dispersion relations follow conventional spin wave theory @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath4 , @xmath3 and @xmath12 quoted in the table are the directly measured values without application of any quantum corrections .",
    "it is interesting to consider the effects of increasing departures of the hamiltonian from the heisenberg form in easy - axis systems .",
    "this is equivalent to increasing @xmath15 while keeping the exchange parameters @xmath4 and @xmath3 fixed .",
    "even small values of @xmath15 break the symmetry by aligning the moments triangles in a plane that contains the @xmath81 axis and splitting the critical point into two critical points at @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath31 decreases until it becomes zero at @xmath82 .",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath73 increase as @xmath15 increases , as can be seen for instance by comparing csnicl@xmath5 with csnibr@xmath5 where @xmath4 and @xmath3 are similar but the values of @xmath12 differ by an order of magnitude .",
    "@xmath70 increases as @xmath83 and experiment seems to indicate that @xmath84 .",
    "we now discuss the phase diagram and critical properties of the easy - axis magnets .",
    "the theory is constructed assuming that the parameters of the system are such as to give a phase diagram of the type shown in figure  4 with the magnetic structures that we have described .",

    "csnibr@xmath5 @xcite and csmni@xmath5 @xcite suggests that the second prediction is also good .",
    "the experiments all clearly show that the two lines of phase transitions to paramagnetism come in parallel to the line of first - order phase transitions and give clear indications that there is curvature in the line of phase transitions through @xmath31 close to the multicritical point such as to make the predicted effect likely .",
    "table [ hea_crit ] lists the experimental determinations of the critical exponents @xmath35 , @xmath37 , @xmath36 and @xmath38 and compares the results with predictions for various universality classes . as well as the critical exponents ,",

    "the measured indices do not fall within any standard universality class , but they do seem to be the same at the two transitions as predicted . the neutron data could be described numerically by chiral heisenberg critical exponents , suggesting that the crossover from the multicritical point takes place slowly , but the specific heat data and theoretical prediction number 6 both argue against this possibility .",

    "_ @xcite indicate that there is also a small component of ordered moment in the xy plane , but this has not been reported in the work on rbcobr@xmath5 or cscocl@xmath5 .",
    "if confirmed , such ordering would arise from the term involving the parameter @xmath7 in equation ( [ h_i ] ) and indicates departure from the ising form .",
    "second , a perhaps surprising experimental result is that , although the specific heat has a clear anomaly at @xmath30 , there is no feature corresponding to the transitions at @xmath31 and @xmath174 @xcite .",
    "theory has concentrated on the solution to the true ising system on the basis of the hamiltonian given in equation ( [ h_i ] ) with @xmath175 .",
    "there has also been work with next - nearest - neighbour interactions in the basal plane included , so as to reduce the ground state degeneracy .",
    "the ground state in the landau - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) model is case  c ) of figure  [ ising_spin_arr ]  @xcite .",
    "there is a transition at temperature @xmath31 to a second ordered state corresponding to case  a ) of figure  [ ising_spin_arr ] where one sublattice has a zero mean value of @xmath165 .",
    "plumer , caill and hood @xcite show that , if the lgw treatment is expanded to higher orderin the spin density , the phase transition can split into two transitions at @xmath31 and @xmath174 , although the splitting , @xmath176 is small , of order 1% .",
    "the specific heat effects are of opposite sign and tend to cancel , agreeing with the experimental findings .    as discussed earlier , experiments @xcite at low temperatures indicates the presence of an ordered state that corresponds to case b ) of figure  [ ising_spin_arr ] in contradiction to the predictions of the lgw model .",
    "kurata and kawamura @xcite have recently shown that an extension of mean - field theory to include correlation effects in the xy plane can give the observed ferrimagnetic ground state .    even after this difficulty is taken care of , however , the lgw treatment still has shortcomings as it does not give the correct low temperature state , which coppersmith @xcite has shown involves some disorder on every site .",
    "the various experiments refered to above report similar values of the ordered moment at low temperature with a mean of 3.2(2 )  @xmath177 .",
    "there is no appreciable difference between the predicted maximum ordered moment of @xmath178 @xcite and the measured moment , so the amount of the disorder is not large .",
    "however recent nmr work of kohmoto _ et al . _",
    "@xcite shows direct evidence of the presence of disorder at low temperatures as predicted .",
    "another approach to the solution of the frustrated ising model is to use monte - carlo methods .",
    "@xmath180 @xcite have shown that this gives the ferrimagnetic phase at low temperatures and two other ordered phases at higher temperatures , in good agreement with experiment .",
    "the high - temperature ordered phase , between @xmath30 and @xmath31 , is a randomly modulated phase ( rmp ) .",
    "although the long - range order persists on a @xmath169 by @xmath169 cell , there is a random modulation of @xmath165 on all three sites .",
    "the order parameter is the magnetic structure factor , @xmath181 with @xmath182 .",
    "the low - temperature structure , with t@xmath183 , also has @xmath184 as the order parameter , but with @xmath185 .",

    "the structure is complex with the characteristics of the rmp phase present . but with an anomalous temperature dependence of the order parameter @xmath186 .",
    "neutron scattering is a direct technique for characterizing the phase transitions at @xmath30 and at @xmath174 because it can measure the scattering around @xmath173 and ( 001 ) directly .",
    "it is an unanswered question whether there is a true phase transition at @xmath31 , though there clearly is a region just above @xmath174 where the magnetic order has unusual temperature dependence .",
    "there is qualitative agreement between the neutron - scattering data and the monte carlo work both with regard to the temperature dependence of the magnetic structure factors and to the ratio of @xmath30 to @xmath31 and to @xmath174 .",

    "the nature of the phase transition at @xmath30 has received much attention , both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "@xcite used renormalisation group arguments to predict that the transition is in the same universality class as the order - disorder phase transition in the three - dimensional xy model .",
    "early monte carlo work on the phase transition was done by matsubara and inawashiro @xcite and by hienonen and petschek @xcite but the most accurate analysis comes from the work of bunker _",

    "the experimental value for @xmath38 claims higher accuracy than any of the theoretical values but again no definitive conclusions can be made .",
    "the monte carlo simulations of plumer _ et al . _ @xcite indicate that the critical region at @xmath30 is smaller than usual due to the proximity of another ordered phase that is would be stabilized by next - nearest - neighbour interactions of order 10% of @xmath60 . the recent neutron scattering work of rogge @xcite on cscobr@xmath5 shows results incompatible with a normal critical phase transition , in that the critical fluctuations can not be described in terms of a model with a single length scale",
    "this whole situation is unclear and more work is needed to resolve it .    because of the ising nature of the hamiltonian and the quasi - one - dimensional nature of the magnetic interactions , the excitations in these compounds are predominantly of the soliton type .",
    "solitons have been observed in both cscocl@xmath5 @xcite and cscobr@xmath5 @xcite and the results used to determine the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath7 in the hamiltonian ( equation ( [ h_i ] ) ) .",

    "this result is not in accord with the idea of a randomly modulated phase @xcite from monte carlo simulations .",
    "since all the monte carlo work has been carried out for much - less - one - dimensional hamiltonians ( smaller values of @xmath187 ) than is found in actual abx@xmath5 compounds , and since the soliton ideas are products of the one dimensionality , the soliton measurements @xcite raise questions about whether the monte carlo simulations map on to the real materials , particularly as the excitations are fundamentally different .",

    "the magnetic structure corresponds to an easy - plane antiferromagnet with no distortions at low temperatures . as usual the interactions are much stronger along @xmath11 than within the @xmath58 plane , giving rise to quasi - one - dimensional properties above @xmath25 .",

    "a similar phase transition occurs in this case , but the critical field , @xmath70 is 8 to 25 times larger than when @xmath102 is applied in the basal plane @xcite .",
    "the critical properties of csnif@xmath5 are not simple .",

    "it is apparent from previous chapters ( or at least authors hope it is apparent ) that there is a plenty of triangular magnets , physical properties of which depend on type and relative strength of exchange and anisotropic interactions .",
    "those properties are not totally established yet .",
    "even less understanding of properties of diluted and mixed triangular magnets is currently achieved ",
    "they found to be sophisticated as much again .",
    "nevertheless , some interesting results and ideas have been found in the process of their investigation .",
    "it is useful to draw the analogy here between the triangular antiferromagnets and another example of frustrated magnetic system , xy square - lattice antiferromagnet dominated by second - neighbor antiferromagnetic exchange . in the latter case dilution acts against thermal and quantum fluctuations , producing an effect known as `` ordering due to disorder ''  @xcite .",
    "present chapter summarises briefly characteristics of diluted and mixed magnets on triangular lattice .",
    "the obvious method to `` disturb '' magnetic system is to introduce small amount of nonmagnetic impurities .",
    "the presence of an impurity results either in mechanical distortion of the structure of the original crystal or in disruption of some part of the interaction between the magnetic atoms , which is reflected in the collective behaviour of the spin system .",
    "random field effect due to non - magnetic impurities on spin correlation was studied by elastic neutron scattering and magnetic susceptibility measurements in ising antiferromagnet , cscocl@xmath5 , doped by mg or zn @xcite and by measurements of diffuse scattering in cscocl@xmath5 doped by mg @xcite .",
    "the reduction of the upper magnetic transition temperature , @xmath30 , has been found in samples with impurities : @xmath300  k ,",
    "@xmath301  k and @xmath302  k for the pure crystal , crystal with 0.58% of mg and crystal with 1.7% of mg respectively @xcite , while temperature of the lower magnetic transition , @xmath31 , could not be found down to 1.6  k @xcite .",
    "the mg concentration was determined by a chemical analysis .    on the other hand , detailed esr and magnetization measurements of heisenberg triangular antiferromagnet , rbnicl@xmath5 , doped with 1% of mg showed that the neel temperature remained unchanged from pure crystal , in which @xmath303  k @xcite .",
    "however , the influence of the impurity at low temperature is still well pronounced : 1 ) the spin - flop region became much broader , 2 ) the gap @xmath304 of one of the resonance branches has increased from 55  ghz to 61  ghz , 3 ) the gap of another resonance branch has found to be 20  ghz , while in the pure crystal it has not been observed and the estimated value for pure crystal is 0.2  ghz .",
    "such a dramatic changing of the resonance spectrum was successfully described by introducing a two - ion anisotropy of the form @xmath305 into the spin hamiltonian  ( [ h_h ] ) .",
    "it has been postulated that an impurity which does not occupy a site in the crystal lattice strongly distorts the electrical interactions within the crystal , altering the character of the anisotropic interactions .",
    "in contrast to the case of doped cscocl@xmath5 , where mg concentration was different in different crystals , a @xmath36  activation analysis reviled approximately the same concentration ( about 1% ) of mg in all investigated crystals of rbnicl@xmath5 .    very unusual result has been reported recently by yamazaki _",

    "temperature - dependence of the magnetic susceptibility for a sample with @xmath308=0.026 suggests that the ordering temperature is about 35  k , while in a pure sample @xmath309  k  @xcite .",
    "such a dramatic increase of the ordering temperature obviously has to be confirmed by some other techniques .",
    "the influence of diamagnetic dilution on the magnetic ordering process of the induced - moment antiferromagnet rbfecl@xmath5 was studied in ref .",

    "samples showed transitions from paramagnetic to the ic@xmath143 phase at the same temperature , @xmath231  k ( see fig .  [ rbfecl3_phd ] ) , then transitions to the ic@xmath6 and c phases at temperatures that decreased sharply with @xmath308 .",
    "the @xmath308=0.05 sample also shows a transition to the ic@xmath143 phase at @xmath231  k , but no further transitions down to the lowest temperature of 1.38  k. an additional elastic diffuse magnetic scattering component centred at the vector @xmath42 has been found to persist to temperatures well above @xmath25 in all samples .",
    "another method of investigation of the magnetic system consists of introducing small amount of magnetic impurities .",
    "a substitution of magnetic ions can modify the amplitude , or even sign , of the effective single - ion anisotropy .",
    "for example , in pure rbnicl@xmath5 the splitting between @xmath30 and @xmath31 is very small , 0.14  t @xcite , while addition of only 5% of co results in as much as 9  k between @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "magnetic phase diagrams of heisenberg triangular antiferromagnet , csni@xmath310cl@xmath5 ( @xmath311=co , fe , mg ) have been determined by heat capacity @xcite and ultrasonic velocity @xcite measurements .",

    "magnetic phase diagrams of csni@xmath310cl@xmath5 for @xmath314 is shown on fig .",
    "[ deluted ] .",
    "apart from addition of small amount of impurities into antiferromagnet on triangular lattice , some investigations had been done on mixed systems , where the impurity concentration is not small . in ref .",
    "@xcite the magnetic phase diagram of rb@xmath306k@xmath307nicl@xmath5 has been studied by susceptibility and torque measurements .",
    "pure rbnicl@xmath5 is a heisenberg antiferromagnet with easy - axis type anisotropy , while knicl@xmath5 demonstrates large easy - plane type anisotropy , see chapter  [ heis ] .",
    "the transition between two different types of anisotropy has been found at @xmath315 .",
    "the interpretation of the observed phase diagram at large @xmath308 is quite complicated due to crystal structure distortions of pure knicl@xmath5 .",
    "a.harrison and coauthors @xcite had investigated magnetic ordering effects in the mixed singlet - groud - state magnets afex@xmath5 , where a is a mixture of cs and rb or x is the mixture of cl and br .",
    "as it was shown in the chapter  [ sgs ] csfecl@xmath5 has `` truly '' nonmagnetic ground state , while in rbfecl@xmath5 sufficiently strong exchange interaction causes magnetic ordering at @xmath316  k. therefore , the replacement of rb in rbfecl@xmath5 by cs should decrease neel temperature or even suppress magnetic ordering .",
    "indeed , it was found experimentaly @xcite , that as low as 5% of cs is sufficient to destroy long - range magnetic ordering . in rbfecl@xmath317br@xmath307",
    "there is an obvious competition between ferro and antiferromagnetic sign of the intrachain interactions : in rbfecl@xmath5 the exchange along @xmath11-axis is ferromagnetic , while in rbfebr@xmath5 it is antiferromagnetic ( see chapter  [ sgs ] ) .",
    "again , low concentrations of either type of dopant , @xmath318 , destroys the magnetic long - range order @xcite .",
    "note , that at intermediate compositions a singlet ground - state phase has been observed , rather than expected a spin - glass phase .",
    "as it was mentioned in the introduction , there are several ways that triangles of antiferromagnetic interactions can be built into a crystal lattice .",
    "the distinguished feature of the majority of antiferromagnets on a stacked triangular lattice , described in this article , is the appearance at sufficiently low temperature of the three - dimensional long - range magnetic ordering , despite the frustration of the exchange interaction .",
    "the transition temperature of this sort of antiferromagnets is typically an order of magnitude lower than the curie - weiss temperature , but such a big reduction of the transition temperature usually arises from a combination of two effects , frustration and the low - dimensionality of actual stacked - triangular materials ( they have quasi 1d or 2d character ) .",
    "the influence of the frustration on magnetic properties of other triangular antiferromagnets , which have more complicated structures , is apparently more substantial .",
    "for example , in kagome - lattice antiferromagnet srcr@xmath319ga@xmath320o@xmath321 , with @xmath322  @xcite , the low - temperature ground state is a spin glass . in gadolinium",
    "gallium garnet , gd@xmath5ga@xmath323o@xmath324 , where the magnetic gd ions are on two interpenetrating corner - sharing triangular sublattices , long range magnetic order has been found only in the applied magnetic field around 1  t  @xcite , while in a lower field magnetization is different for a field cooling and zero field cooling  @xcite , which is typical for a spin glass .",
    "many pyrochlores with the chemical formula a@xmath6b@xmath6o@xmath325 also undergo a phase transition to a spin glass state  @xcite .",
    "because triangular antiferromagnets on a stacked triangular lattice still can be described at low temperature in terms of neel - type ordering , rather than spin - glass or a short - range order , they form a good basis for the study of the effects of frustration on magnetic systems .",
    "frustration leads to new physics with novel phase diagrams and critical properties .",
    "zero - point fluctuations are found in ising systems ; these become large in @xmath20 and heisenberg systems .",
    "theory and experiment seem to be in good accord in describing the ground state and the excitations of the triangular antiferromagnets except in the case of s=1 quasi - one - dimensional nickel materials where spin - wave theory seems to be inadequate .",
    "correction terms for ground - state fluctuations are larger than can be dealt with confidently and vestiges of the one - dimensional haldane effect are believed to be present .",
    "theoretical predictions of the nature of the phase diagram as a function of @xmath102 and @xmath326 are in accord with experiment , but the critical properties at phase transitions are often not described satisfactorily . for materials with the heisenberg hamiltonian ,",
    "the theoretical consensus favours kawamura s so(3 ) chiral universality class , but experiments show significant discrepancies . for the @xmath20 hamiltonian",
    "the theoretical situation is controversial with three contending scenarios , chiral @xmath20 properties , tricritical properties and a weak first - order phase transition .",
    "experiment , which is largely confined to one material , csmnbr@xmath5 , shows a critical phase transition with exponents that can be taken to be in agreement with either the chiral @xmath20 model or tricritical exponents ; the two theories give quite similar predictions for the exponents . there is a need for measurements of critical exponents of weak ( @xmath119 ) easy - plane materials and for strong easy - plane materials in a field .    for easy - axis materials the experimental values and the theoretical predictions for the critical indices @xmath35 , @xmath37 and @xmath36 at both of the two zero - field phase transitions are irreconcilable .",
    "the experimental values are not in accord with the scaling laws and a confirmation of the single report of values of @xmath37 and @xmath36 would be desirable .    a number of cobalt quasi - one - dimensional triangular antiferromagnets have hamiltonians that are close to the ising hamiltonian .",
    "the zero - field properties of these materials is not simple with three phase transitions .",
    "only the upper one of these shows a specific - heat anomaly .",
    "most theoretical works have predicted critical exponents at the upper critical temperature that follow the three - dimensional unfrustrated @xmath20 model , and most experiments agree with these predictions .",
    "one recent monte - carlo study suggested slightly different exponents , but unfortunately the experiments are not sufficiently accurate to distinguish .",
    "one group has recently reported experimental determinations of @xmath35 that are significantly lower than those given in other reports , and that are not in accord with any theoretical predictions .",
    "it has long been a puzzle why one triangular antiferromagnet , rbmnbr@xmath5 shows an incommensurate magnetic structure .",
    "recently we and our coworkers have shown this to arise from small structural distortions of the lattice along planes perpendicular to the basal plane .",
    "these distortions , which map on to the row model of zhang , saslow and gabay , allow relatively small changes in exchange parameters , arising from the distortions , to destroy the simple triangular magnetic structure .",
