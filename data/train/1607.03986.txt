    "during stellar burning , reactions involving different seed nuclei assume importance at different temperature and burning zones .",
    "the seeds in the concerned mass range a=40 - 54 are mainly produced during hydrostatic carbon burning and explosive oxygen burning .",
    "these then take part in synthesizing more massive elements via various reactions occurring in later phases of evolution  @xcite .",
    "the principle energy generating processes in stars i.e the pp - cycle , cno cycle , hcno cycle , _ rp _ process etc are reactions which require continuous addition of protons against the coulomb barrier . certain astrophysical sites , such as x - ray bursters , involve high flux of protons at temperature @xmath1 several gk and matter density @xmath1 @xmath2 g / cc that initiate a rapid proton capture process which ultimately results in a thermal burst of very short duration , peaked in x ray regime .",
    "knowledge of the cross sections , and equivalently , the rates of the reactions occurring in these sites are required to study complete nucleosynthesis via a network calculation .",
    "however , it is difficult to measure all the essential rates in terrestrial laboratories due to unavailability and instability of required targets .",
    "reaction rates calculated in a theoretical approach may provide necessary information to this context after proper validation of theory with the experimental data . for abundance calculation in explosive astrophysical environment",
    ", the concerned network must have to take various quantities like temperature , pressure , proton mass fraction along with forward and reverse reaction rates into account .",
    "so , we need to take care about the proper tuning of the interaction potential .",
    "many works have been devoted so far to study the theoretical capture cross sections by constructing different nucleon - nucleus potentials .",
    "@xcite have calculated reaction rates in a global approach and suggested that statistical model calculation can be made improved using locally tuned nuclear properties like optical potential .",
    "reaction rates from phenomenological approach i.e , with phenomenological global optical potentials or even with semimicroscopic optical potential with phenomenological densities give rise to uncertainty and the reaction rates have to be varied by large factors to study their effects .",
    "prediction of rates , as has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite , gave rise to uncertainties away from the stability valley .",
    "phenomenological global optical potential should not be expected to provide an adequate description of nucleon - nucleus interaction as differences in nuclear structure among adjacent nuclei do not allow simple and smooth z- and a- dependence of the woods - saxon parameters .",
    "microscopic optical potentials obtained by folding with appropriate microscopic densities are expected to be more accurate and do not require frequent variation of the reaction rates . on the other hand , calculation of reaction rates in a microscopic or semimicroscopic with microscopic density prescription approach is far more free from these uncertainties .",
    "recently , the semimicroscopic optical potential obtained in a folding model prescription has proved to be highly successful in explaining various nuclear phenomena .",
    "for example , bauge _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have constructed a lane - consistent semimicroscopic optical potential to study elastic scattering and differential and total cross sections for nuclei over a broad mass range .",
    "the theoretical cross section calculation requires a complete knowledge of various ingredients such as transmission coefficients , i.e. , transition probabilities ( averaged over resonances of the compound nucleus formed upon radiative proton captures ) between various states which in turn depend on the level schemes , lifetimes of the states , level densities , @xmath3 ray strength functions , nuclear masses , giant dipole resonance parameters , etc .",
    "application of statistical model requires sufficiently high nuclear level density in the compound nuclear state .",
    "the theoretical reactions are generally derived in hauser - feshabach ( hf ) formalism which assumes presence of sufficiently large number of resonances at relevant energies .",
    "the cross sections are in general sum of contribution from different reaction mechanisms depending on projectile energies . at higher energies ,",
    "presence of many close and overlapping resonances allow one to calculate an average cross sections using hf approach .",
    "sometimes there are interference effects between single resonance and direct capture .",
    "the nonresonant reaction cross sections are mainly determined by the direct capture transitions to the ground states and low excited states . in light nuclei and low energy regime , level densities",
    "are generally low , especially for targets near closed shells with widely spaced nuclear levels and close to drip lines with low particle separation energies and q - values .",
    "hence , application of statistical model to these nuclei at astrophysical temperatures is somewhat problematic and requires careful study .",
    "optical potential is a very important ingredient in hf statistical model calculation . here",
    ", we have constructed an optical potential by folding the density dependent m3y ( ddm3y ) interaction with the densities of the target .",
    "the ddm3y interaction has proved to be successful in explaining various nuclear properties .",
    "for example , folded ddm3y nucleon - nucleus interaction potential has been successfully used to study the incompressibility of infinite nuclear matter @xcite and radioactivity lifetimes of spherical proton rich nuclei @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we have presented the framework of our calculation . in section iii",
    "we discuss the results and in the last section we summarize .",
    "proton capture reactions for nuclei a @xmath4 40 have q - values @xmath4 5 mev which increase with increasing number of neutrons .",
    "we have studied proton capture reactions in several nuclei in the mass range @xmath5 in semimicroscopic hf formalism and compared our results with experiments .",
    "all these nuclei have q values for proton capture at ground states within @xmath1 5 mev to 10 mev .",
    "we have calculated the reaction cross sections in hf approach using the folding model formalism with the talys1.6 code  @xcite .",
    "the code talys incorporates much more physics than the other codes available previously .",
    "it takes care of preequlibrium emission , detailed competition between all open channels , detailed width fluctuation correction , coherent inclusion of fission channel , coupled channel calculaion for deformed nuclei , multiparticle emission etc .",
    "details can be found in talys1.6 manual . along with these advantages of the code , the code can be used with fully microscopic inputs , and hence is suitable for determination of unknown rates , a feature utilized in present calculation .",
    "the present approach scores out the phenomenological method of goriely _ et .",
    "@xcite with the same code .",
    "the hf formalism generally considers the formation of a compound nuclear state .",
    "the present method has been adopted in a number of our recent works  @xcite .",
    "radial densities have been obtained from relativistic mean field ( rmf ) approach using the fsugold lagrangian density  @xcite .",
    "details of which are given in ref  @xcite .",
    "the target is assumed to be spherical and calculations are done in coordinate space . considering finite size of the proton , charge densities are obtained by convoluting the point proton density with a standard gaussian form factor @xmath6  @xcite ,    @xmath7    where @xmath8 here we have @xmath9=@xmath10@xmath11 , with @xmath11=0.80 fm being the root mean square ( rms ) charge radius of proton .",
    "the effect of centre of mass correction is neglected while calculating the charge density or radius as it goes as a@xmath12 as given in ref  @xcite .",
    "the ddm3y interaction is folded with the radial densities of targets obtained from rmf approach .",
    "this interaction potential is then incorporated into the reaction code .",
    "the interaction , in mev , at a distance @xmath13 ( in @xmath14)is given by @xcite , @xmath15 with the m3y interaction ( including a zero range pseudo potential ) given by @xcite , @xmath16 e is the energy in mev in the center of mass frame of the projectile and @xmath17 being the nuclear density .",

    "@xmath19\\ ] ] the constants c and @xmath20 are assigned values 2.07 and 1.624 @xmath21 , respectively , obtained from nuclear matter calculation  @xcite .",
    "we have further included a spin - orbit term coupled with phenomenological energy dependent potential depths according to sheerbaum prescription  @xcite as @xmath22 where , @xmath23 @xmath24    ddm3y interaction potential provides only the real part and the imaginary part of the optical model potential has been taken to be identical with the real part .",
    "the folded potential is then renormalized to obtain the reasonable agreement with experimental data .",
    "we have used the same renormalization factor , 0.9 , for the entire mass region and have used the same potential for the real and the imaginary parts of the potential .",
    "the advantage of same renormalization factor for entire mass region ensures that the present method can be extended to nuclei where experimental data are not available .",
    "nuclear level densities are important ingredients of the calculation  @xcite .",
    "we have used goriely s microscopic results for level density  @xcite and hartree - fock - bogoliubov model for e1 @xmath3 ray strength function  @xcite .",
    "these choices were used in some of our previous calculations also .",
    "we always try to avoid too much variation of the theory or input parameters to have easy extrapolation of the rate parameters in future use .",
    "hence , we decided to keep the nuclear level density model same as in our previous publications in the mass range 55 - 80  @xcite .",
    "we have checked that this choice works well in the mass region a=@xmath25 .",
    "width fluctuation correction , which is due to the retention of some memory of the initial channel , is also important . though it assumes significance mainly in elastic scattering , it is also important near threshold energies , where competition cusps arise due to the existence of different channel strengths .",
    "density profile figure     +    [ cols=\"^,>,>,>,>,^,>,>,>,>,^ , > , > , > , > \" , ]     nuclear masses , if experimental values are not available , are taken from ref .",

    "thirty discrete levels both for target and residual nuclei have been taken into consideration in hauser - feshbach decay and @xmath3 ray cascade .",
    "full @xmath26 coupling between the states is considered .",
    "the talys database includes all these necessary ingredients .",
    "astrophysical proton capture reactions are mainly important in a definite energy window , termed as effective gamow energy window , distributed around the gamow peak  @xcite . in charged particle reactions",
    ", the window arises from the folding of the maxwell - boltzmann distribution of the particles with the coulomb barrier penetrability .",
    "consequently , rates for charged particle reactions are largely suppressed at both low and high energies . both the peak energy and the width depend on charges of the projectile and the target and temperature of the astrophysical environment .",
    "proton capture reaction cross sections have been calculated for energies relevant to this energy window and compared with available experimental data .",
    "the relevant gamow energy window for this mass region lies in between 1 - 2 mev corresponding to the temperature  @xmath12gk .",
    "s factors are commonly used in astrophysical applications at such low incident energies where cross sections show strong energy dependence .",
    "s factors remove the coulomb dependence and hence it is a slowly varying function of energy .",

    "we have calculated the rates of those reactions with our theoretical model and further compared with the rates predicted by non - smoker reaction code  @xcite .",
    "in the present work , rmf approach is used to obtain density distributions which are then folded with the interaction to obtain the optical potential .",
    "we have plotted the charge density profiles of some nuclei in the relevant mass region in fig .",

    "the present rate exceeds non - smoker prediction above 2 gk and below this temperature it is less . on the other hand , our present calculation of astrophysical rates for the @xmath0 reactions of @xmath48v and @xmath68co ,",
    "got merged with the non - smoker calculation up to 2 and 1.5 gk respectively .",
    "the difference between the two calculated rates increases with temperature in case of @xmath56v@xmath0 reaction",
    ". it will be very interesting to see the effect of these rates in the abundance calculation of nuclei in relevant astrophysical environment .",
    "to summarize , we calculated the cross sections for @xmath0 reactions in the mass range 40 - 54 in the relevant gamow energy window appropriate for low energy astrophysical environment using the well known reaction code talys1.6 .",
    "charge radii and binding energy values of various stable nuclei calculated using rmft have been compared in this concerned mass region a = 40 - 54 with the available experimental data .",
    "the ddm3y nn interaction is folded with target nuclear densities calculated from rmft to construct the optical potential which is needed for hf statistical model calculation and after proper normalization it has been used to verify the theory with the observed experimental data .",
    "the @xmath0 reaction rates are calculated and plotted along with non - smoker reaction rates .",
    "the main feature of our work is to place all the nuclei considered in this mass region a = 40 - 54 at the same footing and to use same methodology for all of them to avoid systematic error .",
