    "much work has been done on optimal re - hedging frequency to improve the efficiency of hedges in real - world market conditions ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "however , we base much of our work on  @xcite , which examines the effects of adjusting @xmath0-hedges with charm for short - term maturity options . we will adapt and extend this approach from the viewpoint of incorporating information .",
    "suppose we have a market - neutral options strategy .",
    "we enter into a long position in a european call option at @xmath1 . here",
    ", we introduce a new piece to the puzzle .",
    "suppose we know from experience ( or constraints ) that we will hold our position until at least a later time @xmath2 , whereupon we can exit our position at any time .",
    "classically , we would hedge at @xmath1 , re - balancing as needed over the interval @xmath3 $ ] .    without re - balancing , due to the market evolving over time , our hedge would no longer be perfect at @xmath4 .",
    "the question we seek to answer is therefore : given that we know our holding period interval , can we preemptively adjust our hedge at @xmath1 such that we are perfectly hedged at @xmath4 ? or",
    "at least better - hedged ?",
    "what if we have views on the market dynamics over the interval @xmath3 $ ] ?",
    "we assume that our views of other market dynamics exists only on @xmath3 $ ] . from a practitioner s standpoint ,",
    "this assumption is akin to the notion that if we do have a lower bound @xmath4 for our holding period , then we can presumably run accurate conditional statistics on market dynamics on past intervals of that length .",
    "given a @xmath0-hedged portfolio consisting of a long position in a european call option , hedged at @xmath1 @xmath5 we wish to have @xmath6 in the standard black - scholes - merton framework from  @xcite , the number of shares @xmath7 we need to short is simply @xmath8 .",
    "unfortunately , this is unlikely to be accurate , as @xmath9 will likely change with time - varying market conditions . since we know that @xmath9 is time - varying , we can attempt to correct for its time - decay component by setting @xmath10 however , this assumes that @xmath9 changes linearly with time .",
    "we can include a nonlinear correction parameter @xmath11 , and define @xmath12 though we must still determine @xmath11 .",
    "while @xmath11 can be approximated numerically ,  @xcite determines it analytically ( to @xmath13 ) .",
    "he treats this from the point of view of first - order hedging effects for short - term maturity options , but this is the same problem ( mathematically ) as we are attempting to solve .",
    "the author defines the hedging error @xmath14 and attempts to minimize it .",
    "namely , he arrives at a formula involving the growth rate @xmath15 of the underlying , and concludes that if @xmath16 , we get back to a bsm hedge , but if @xmath17 , the mean squared hedging error ( mshe ) can be minimized by adjusting the number of shares @xmath18 by defining @xmath19 and @xmath20 however , as seen in  @xcite , minimizing mshe may not be the best option , opting instead work mainly with the mean absolute hedging error ( mahe ) .      looking at the literature from the point of view of incorporating views , we now have a plausible solution for incorporating information about two quantities : the growth rate of the underlying @xmath15 , and the time at which we may liquidate @xmath4 ( ie , @xmath21 ) .",
    "the natural extension of this work would be to account for any views on implied volatility @xmath22 .",
    "note that we are not making any changes to what we believe the volatility of the underlying @xmath23 will do , we keep the standard bsm assumption that it will be constant .",
    "to summarize , the question is now the following : for a portfolio of the form @xmath24 can we adjust the number of shares required to hedge ( with respect to the underlying ) our long call position to account for both the @xmath25 and @xmath26 components ?",
    "we work under the following assumptions : the underlying follows a standard geometric brownian motion process @xmath27 and we consider an arbitrary stochastic process for implied volatility of the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 are well - defined deterministic functions . for clarity of notation ,",
    "we write @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "we also assume @xmath32 satisfies the @xmath33 equation @xmath34    note that this is technically incorrect , as we will soon define a process for implied volatility , and the theory does not account for any difference in implied volatility and volatility of the underlying .",
    "in fact , there are no two quantities in the bsm framework , only one volatility .",
    "nonetheless , this assumption allows us to simplify our equations a noticeable amount , and we will leave the case where we do not use equation   for a later version ( much like using the @xmath33 option price formula after accounting for volatility smiles ) .    the natural extension of equation   would be to set @xmath35 however , @xmath36 is stochastic .",
    "this is where our assumption that the interval of information is fixed comes into play .",
    "if we have the endpoints of the interval , then in practice we could simulate the paths of the process and take the expected value , recasting the problem in a deterministic framework ( explored in section  [ sec:4 ] ) .",
    "more rigorously , let us take @xmath37\\ ] ] we assume @xmath38 are uncorrelated .",
    "note again that this formulation would not be as well defined given a random interval @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "this section presents our main contribution , and derives an expression for the hedging error ( to @xmath13 ) in our framework and minimizes that error with respect to @xmath40 in equation  .",
    "this derivation is heavily inspired by  @xcite .",
    "a summary of the results , as well as numerical simulations is presented in section  [ sec:4 ] .",
