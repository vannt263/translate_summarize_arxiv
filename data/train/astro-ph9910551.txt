    "improvements in the zodiacal light emission and scattering to be given by space observations at 3 au , compared with observations near the earth , were discussed by _ mather and beichman ( 1996)_. unfortunately , a rather accurate multi - parametric model of the zodiacal brightness derived by _ kelsall et al .",
    "( 1998 ) _ from the cobe data can not be reliably extrapolated to heliocentric distances as large as 3 au .",
    "we have developed a physical model of the zodiacal cloud incorporating the real dust sources of asteroidal and cometary origin , which makes it possible to evaluate quantitatively the zodiacal light emission and scattering throughout the solar system ( _ gorkavyi et al .",
    "1997a _ ) .",
    "this model considerably improves our previous ` reference model ' based on the use of the continuity equation for distribution function of dust particles ( _ gorkavyi et al .",
    "1997b , c , 1998 _ ) and enables us to obtain more reliable results than a phenomenological modelling of the zodiacal light ( e.g. _ ebbets 1998 _ ) .",
    "below , we describe an improved model that represents a 3d - grid containing @xmath1 cells with a step in ( heliocentric latitude @xmath2 , longitude @xmath3 , and radius @xmath4 ) to be @xmath5 [ au ] ) . using a new numerical approach to the dynamics of minor bodies and dust particles , we increase the number of particle positions employed in each model to @xmath6 without using a supercomputer ( _ ozernoy et al .",

    "we compute here the distribution of the zodiacal dust emission and scattering in the solar system .",
    "the processes influencing the dust particle dynamics include gravitational scattering on all planets , except pluto ( inclinations and precession of the planets are neglected ) , mean motion resonances , and the poynting - robertson / solar wind drags .",
    "we employ here 931 sources of dust particles ( with eccentricities @xmath7 ) , which include 284 asteroids , 451 short - period comets , and 196 kuiper belt objects .",
    "we adopt a two - component approximation for dust particle size distribution , which is characterized by the parameter @xmath8 and 0.057 for ( 1 - 2)@xmath0 m and ( 5 - 10)@xmath0 m particles , respectively .",
    "the inferred dust density distribution , @xmath9 , of the ipd at heliocentric distances @xmath10 au enables us to compute the scattered light and the thermal emission of the zodiacal cloud as a function of the observer s latitude and longitude .",
    "the thermal emission and scattering of the zodiacal cloud are given by : @xmath11ds\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the planck function at frequency @xmath13 , @xmath14 is albedo , @xmath15 is the dust temperature , @xmath16 with @xmath17k and @xmath18 ( _ kelsall et al . 1998 _ ) , @xmath19 is the solar flux , @xmath20 is the phase function at scattering angle @xmath21 ( _ kelsall et al .",
    "1998 _ ) .",
    "note that although the phase function only weakly depends on @xmath13 , the value of @xmath22 strongly depends on @xmath13 through the solar flux .",
    "besides , the planck function strongly depends on heliocentric distance , especially in the near ir ( 1 - 5 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "using the inferred distribution of the zodiacal dust , we have computed a variety of zodiacal light maps , both for thermal emission and scattered components , at different locations @xmath23 of the ngst assumed to be at 1 au or 3 au ( see fig .  1 for the @xmath24m - emission of asteroidal dust and fig .  2 for that of kuiperoidal dust ) .",
    "the brightness as a function of latitude @xmath2 and longitude @xmath3 ( in the telescope s frame ) is given in logarithmic scale ( the neighboring contour intensities differ by @xmath25 ) .",
    "the sun s position is ( 0,0 ) for @xmath26 and is shifted to a negative @xmath2 for @xmath27 au .    at each location , there is a minimum in the zodiacal light which can be seen as a ` dark spot ' ( or several spots ) in the computed figures .",
    "the positions of those minima are explained by an interplay between dependencies of emissivity upon density and temperature .",
    "our numerical results concerning the computed zodiacal light at different locations of ngst are summarized in tables  1 and 2 .",
    "the data presented in table  2 for @xmath28 au , 2nd column can be compared with the cobe data @xmath29 ( 1.25@xmath0 m band ) , @xmath30 ( 5@xmath0 m band ) , and @xmath31 ( 20@xmath0 m band ) .",
    "interestingly , _ it is the kuiperoidal component ( k1 ) whose shape resembles most closely the profile of the zodiacal cloud _ , which might imply that the role of kuiperoidal particles has been highly underestimated so far .",

    "the structure of the zodiacal dust cloud computed in the present work is substantially non - uniform :        \\(iii ) the partial contribution of particles of different origin and size changes with heliocentric distance : as the distance increasess , the contribution of asteroidal particles ( especially of large size ) into the zodiacal light emission sharply decreases , whereas the contribution of the kuiperoidal component increases ;    \\(iv ) the latitudinal dependence of the zodiacal emission is different for different components of the dust cloud . in the anti - sun direction ( @xmath32 ) , the maximum of the asteroidal dust emission at @xmath33 m is reached at the ecliptic plane , whereas the brightness of the cometary component has its minimum here .",
    "\\3 . at @xmath34",
    "au , the zodiacal light brightness in the direction of the pole decreases to @xmath35% at @xmath36 m ; to @xmath37% at @xmath33 m , and to @xmath38% at @xmath39 m compared to that seen near the earth .",
    "\\4 . at each wavelength",
    ", there are certain regions on the sky having a minimal zodiacal light brightness . at short wavelengths ( @xmath40 m ) , these regions are around the poles , and at long wavelengths ( such as 5 to 20 @xmath0 m ) these regions are shifted toward the ecliptic .",
    "this result needs to be taken into consideration while planning observations with ngst .",
    "further improvements in our physical modelling of the zodiacal light are feasible . using cobe and iras data ,",
    "the contribution of dust components of different origin into the zodiacal cloud could be determined .",
    "those improvements would make far going implications possible for extragalactic astronomy and cosmology .",
