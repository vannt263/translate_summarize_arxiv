    "-8pt the stated systematic error in the batse 3b catalog@xcite burst locations is @xmath2 .",
    "this value was estimated by taking the rms deviation of batse positions from known positions of 36 bursts , determined by the ipn , watch , and comptel@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , many of these same known positions were used to calibrate the batse burst location software , i.e. , as a guide in determining what effects to include in the burst location algorithm . in order to calibrate properly the batse burst position errors , an independent set of burst locations",
    "is needed .",
    "such a set exists , in the form of 196 bursts for which single ipn arcs exist@xcite . in this paper",
    "we analyze the systematic errors in the positions of bursts in the batse 1b , 2b and 3b catalogs using these 196 bursts .",
    "our analysis is based upon the likelihood approach .    -8pt",
    "-8pt we assume that the systematic error @xmath0 and statistical error @xmath1 in position are circular gaussians , to be added in quadrature , as prescribed by the batse catalog .",
    "the circular approximation should be good , since roughly @xmath3 of all batse bursts have @xmath4 positional contours that are nearly circular@xcite , and the bursts with ipn arcs tend to be those with larger fluences .",
    "we further assume that the sky is flat ( i.e. , that the size of the total error in the batse burst position is not too large ) , and that the ipn arcs have zero width .",
    "the former is a good approximation , since the largest batse @xmath5 among the bursts with ipn arcs .",
    "the latter is a good approximation since the characteristic width of the 3-@xmath6 contours of the ipn arcs is a few arcminutes , which is much less than the smallest batse @xmath7 .",
    "figure  1 .",
    "configurations for a burst with a known position ( left diagram ) and for a burst with a single ipn arc ( right diagram ) .",
    "the likelihood function for bursts with known positions ( e.g. , two intersecting ipn arcs ) is given by @xmath8 whereas the likelihood function for bursts with single ipn arcs is given by @xmath9 here , @xmath10 is the deviation of the batse position from the known position , @xmath11 is the perpendicular deviation of the batse position from the ipn arc ( see figure 1 ) , and @xmath12 .",
    "the likelihood function @xmath13 allows exploration of any model that we may have for @xmath0 .",
    "here we focus on three models : ( 1 ) @xmath0 = a constant , ( 2 ) @xmath14 erg @xmath15 , and ( 3 ) @xmath16 .",
    "the first model has one free parameter ( @xmath0 ) ; the second and third models have two free parameters ( scale factor @xmath17 and power law index @xmath18 ) .    -8pt",
    "-6pt fitting the constant @xmath0 model to the 18 batse 3b bursts with ipn positions , we find a maximum likelihood ( ml ) value @xmath19 .",
    "this is consistent with the value of @xmath20 quoted in the batse 3b catalog@xcite , which was found using these bursts and some others .        with the value of @xmath20 quoted in the batse 3b catalog , as shown by the probability distribution in @xmath0 ( see figure 2 ) and comparison of the expected and observed distribution of normalized deviations @xmath22 assuming @xmath2 ( see figure 3 ) .      figure  4 .",
    "upper left - hand and lower and upper right - hand panels : 1-@xmath6 , 2-@xmath6 , and 3-@xmath6 contours in the ( @xmath23)-plane for the burst samples and data as labeled , assuming the @xmath1-dependent model .",
    "lower left - hand panel : same as figure 2 , except for the @xmath24-dependent model .      fitting the third model , in which @xmath29",
    ", we find ml values @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "the probability @xmath32 , showing that the data strongly prefer the power - law model over the ml model with constant @xmath33 .",
    "these results imply that @xmath0 is strongly correlated with @xmath34 and @xmath1 .",
    "for example , @xmath35 while @xmath36 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 5 , which shows the ml @xmath34-dependent and @xmath24-dependent models .",
    "figure  5 .",
    "left - hand panel : the ml @xmath34-dependent model .",
    "right - hand panel : the ml @xmath1-dependent model .",
    "the points are _ not _ data points , but rather are the ml _ constant _ @xmath0 model for the given interval in @xmath34 or @xmath1 .",
    "it is also interesting to examine the character of @xmath0 for subsets of the 3b catalog , in particular the 1b sample of bursts in which evidence for repeating was found .",
    "fitting the three models to the `` old '' 1b positions , we find @xmath37 for the ml constant @xmath0 model , and that the data do not request a more complicated model(see figures 3 and 4 ) .",
    "in contrast , fitting the 3b positions for the 1b sample of bursts , we find that the data request the @xmath1-dependent model at the 95% confidence level [ e.g. , @xmath38 ( again see figures 3 and 4 ) .",
    "these results imply that for the 1b sample of bursts , the new ( 3b ) @xmath0 s are smaller than the old ( 1b ) ones for bursts with @xmath39  erg  @xmath40 or with @xmath41 .",
    "however , for the @xmath42 80% of bursts with lower fluences or larger @xmath1 s , they imply that the new @xmath0 s are larger than the old ones .",
    "we are grateful to kevin hurley for providing us with the 3rd catalog of ipn arcs , without which this analysis would not have been possible .",
    "we also wish to thank geoff pendleton and michael briggs for discussing batse burst location issues with us ."
