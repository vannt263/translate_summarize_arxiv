    "in the analysis of practically all available data on two - pion transitions of the @xmath3 mesons from the argus , cleo , cusb , crystal ball , belle , and _ babar _ collaborations  @xmath4 ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 @xmath7 )  the contribution of multi - channel @xmath0 scattering in the final - state interactions is considered .",
    "the analysis , which is aimed at studying the scalar mesons , is performed jointly considering the above bottomonia decays , the isoscalar s - wave processes @xmath8 , which are described in our model - independent approach based on analyticity and unitarity and using an uniformization procedure , and the charmonium decay processes  @xmath9 , @xmath10  with data from the crystal ball , dm2 , mark  ii , mark  iii , and bes  ii collaborations .",
    "we show that the experimentally observed interesting ( even mysterious ) behavior of the @xmath0 spectra of the @xmath3-family decays , beginning from the second radial excitation and higher ,  a bell - shaped form in the near-@xmath0-threshold region , smooth dips about 0.6  gev in the @xmath11 , about 0.45  gev in the @xmath12 , and about 0.7  gev in the @xmath13 , and also sharp dips about 1  gev in the @xmath11  is explained by the interference between the @xmath0 scattering , @xmath14 and @xmath15 contributions to the final states of these decays ( by the constructive one in the near-@xmath0-threshold region and by the destructive one in the dip regions ) .",
    "considering multi - channel @xmath0 scattering , we shall deal with the 3-channel case ( @xmath8 ) because it was shown @xcite that this is a minimal number of coupled channels needed for obtaining correct values of @xmath17-resonance parameters . when performing our combined analysis data for the multi - channel @xmath0 scattering",

    "@xcite for the decays @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) but with allowing for also amplitudes of transitions between the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels in decay formulas .",
    "there was assumed that the pion pairs in the final state have zero isospin and spin .",
    "only these pairs of pions undergo final state interactions whereas the final @xmath27 meson ( @xmath28 ) remains a spectator .",
    "the amplitudes of decays are related with the scattering amplitudes @xmath29 @xmath30 as follows @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 ; indices @xmath35 and @xmath36 correspond to @xmath37 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "the free parameters @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 depend on the couplings of @xmath46 , @xmath47 and the @xmath37 to the channels @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the pole term in eq.(1 ) in front of @xmath48 is an approximation of possible @xmath49 states , not forbidden by ozi rules .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath29 are expressed through the @xmath50-matrix elements  @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the reaction threshold .",
    "the @xmath50-matrix elements are parameterized on the uniformization plane of the @xmath0 scattering amplitude by poles and zeros which represent resonances .",
    "the uniformization plane is obtained by a conformal map of the 8-sheeted riemann surface , on which the three - channel @xmath50 matrix is determined , onto the plane . in the uniformizing variable",
    "used we have neglected the @xmath0-threshold branch point and allowed for the @xmath1- and @xmath2-threshold branch points and left - hand branch point at @xmath54 related to the crossed channels .",
    "the background is introduced to the amplitudes in a natural way : on the threshold of each important channel there appears generally speaking a complex phase shift .",
    "it is important that we have obtained practically zero background of the @xmath0 scattering in the scalar - isoscalar channel .",
    "it confirms well our representation of resonances .",
    "the expression  @xmath55[m_\\psi^2- ( \\sqrt{s}+m_\\phi)^2]}$ ]   for decay @xmath9 and the analogues relations for @xmath56   and @xmath4 give the di - meson mass distributions .",

    "we switched off only those resonances [ @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , removal of which can be somehow compensated by correcting the background to have the more - or - less acceptable description of the multichannel @xmath0 scattering .",
    "first , when leaving out before - mentioned resonances , a minimal set of the @xmath17 mesons consisting of the @xmath72 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 is sufficient to achieve a description of the processes @xmath78 with a total @xmath79 .",
