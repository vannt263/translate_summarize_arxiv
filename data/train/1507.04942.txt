    "in this work properties of the spin-1 heisenberg model are deduced using a random loop model first introduced in the work of nachtergaele @xcite .",
    "random loop models have been around since the work of tth @xcite and aizenman and nachtergaele @xcite .",
    "the aim of @xcite was to obtain a lower bound on the pressure of the spin-@xmath2 heisenberg ferromagnet .",
    "this improved the bound of conlon and solovej @xcite .",
    "sharp bounds have recently been found @xcite .",
    "the loop model presented in @xcite applies to the spin-@xmath2 heisenberg antiferromagnet .",
    "both spin models can be applied to higher spins , for a review of these models we refer , for example , to @xcite .",
    "the work of ueltschi @xcite combines and extends this work and extends these loop models .",
    "it has recently seen attention for its usefulness in several aspect of quantum spin systems . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that there is long - range order in various spin systems , including nematic order in the spin-1 system .",
    "the work of crawford , ng and starr @xcite on emptiness formation also makes use of the model , as does the work of bjrnberg and ueltschi @xcite on decay of correlations in the presence of a transverse magnetic field .",
    "the loop model presented here comes from @xcite , it is similar in flavour to the aizenman - nachtergaele - tth - ueltschi representation .",
    "see refs . @xcite and references therein .",
    "quantum spin systems are currently a very active area of research .",
    "the growth of popularity of probabilistic representations has allowed new methods to be applied to these systems with many interesting results .",
    "this work looks at the general su(2 ) invariant spin-1 heisenberg model with a two - body interaction @xmath3    here we will have @xmath4 and @xmath5 the set of nearest neighbour edges .",
    "the work in @xcite shows that in the region @xmath6 the system exhibits _",
    "nematic order _ in the thermodynamic limit if the temperature is low enough and the dimension is high enough .",
    "nematic order was also shown independently using different methods in @xcite .",
    "it is also shown that if @xmath7 is bipartite there will be _ nel _ order for @xmath8 at low temperature .",
    "this corresponds to the occurrence of infinite loops in the related loop model . alternatively in @xmath9 infinite loops should not occur , it is proved in @xcite that this is the case for @xmath10 , the extension to @xmath11 should be straightforward . the first proof of continuous symmetry breaking was shown by frhlich , simon and spencer @xcite for the classical heisenberg ferromagnet ( and hence antiferromagnet ) .",
    "this result was extended by dyson , lieb and simon @xcite to the quantum antiferromagnet .",
    "the result excluded the case @xmath12 and @xmath13 , it was extended to this case in the work of kennedy , lieb and shastry @xcite .",
    "these works all used the method of reflection positivity and infrared bounds .",
    "for information on reflection positivity see refs . @xcite and references therein .",
    "the heisenberg ferromagnet is not reflection positive and hence does not benefit from these methods .      in this article",
    "we use the method of reflection positivity and infrared bounds on a random loop model .",
    "links between correlations in the spin model and probabilities of events in the loop model are also derived in section 5 .",
    "we focus on the quadrant @xmath14 , see fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that nel order occurs for @xmath10 , it is clear this will extend into the quadrant for @xmath15 small enough .",
    "however it is impossible to say how far nel order will extend without some new results .",
    "this is where the loop model has been essential .",
    "the following result concerning nel order is a reformulation of theorem [ thmneel ] and will be proved in section [ sec neelorder ] .",
    "+    for @xmath16 a box of even side length and @xmath17 there exists @xmath18 such that for @xmath19 if @xmath20 then there exists @xmath21 such that    @xmath22    it is shown in the discussion after theorem [ thmneel ] that this sum is positive if @xmath23 @xmath24 and @xmath25 are integrals to be introduced in .",
    "their values for various @xmath26 are given by    [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     it can be shown @xcite that @xmath27 and @xmath28 as @xmath29 and that both are decreasing in @xmath26 .",
    "this means we can prove that the region where nel order occurs will increase to the entire quadrant @xmath19 as @xmath29 i.e. the ratio @xmath30 is increasing . in @xmath12 there is nel order in the spin system for @xmath31 , this is a triangular region of angle @xmath32 measured from the @xmath33 axis .",
    "we actually prove the `` @xmath34 '' version of this theorem .",
    "the limits no doubt exist but we do not prove it here . in order to extend into the region @xmath11 we use the falk - bruch inequality @xcite .",
    "this means we must control the double commutator terms coming the biquadratic ( @xmath35 ) interaction , this is achieved by appealing to the random loop model , it is certainly not clear how to handle these terms directly .    the random loop model is presented in section [ sec loopmodel ] and [ sec spinconfigs ] .",
    "the spin-1 heisenberg model is introduced in section [ sec spin1model ] . in section [ sec looprep ] the connection between the loop model and the quantum system",
    "is proved .",
    "in particular it is shown how to write various correlation functions in terms of probabilities of events in the loop model , some of these correlations are also presented in @xcite . in section [ sec neelorder ] the main result concerning nel order is presented and proved .",
    "we now introduce the loop model presented in @xcite . to begin we take a finite set of vertices , @xmath7 , with a set of edges , @xmath5 .",
    "edges will be between different vertices , with at most one edge per pair .",
    "often we will take a lattice @xmath36 with nearest neighbour edges and periodic boundary conditions . for our lattice @xmath7",
    "we introduce an associated lattice and edge set : @xmath37 put simply we now have two sites in @xmath38 for every site in @xmath7 and an edge for every possible joining of one site associated to @xmath39 to one site associated to @xmath40 .",
    "we will usually write @xmath41 instead of the more cumbersome @xmath42 .    for @xmath43",
    "we consider a poisson point process on @xmath44 $ ] that has two events , one we call single bars and one double bars ( note that in @xcite .",
    "the single bars were called double bars ) the single bars will occur at rate @xmath45 and the double bars at rate @xmath35 for parameters @xmath19 .",
    "it seems odd to have a rate of @xmath45 with @xmath46 but this is done to be consistent with the connection to quantum spin systems that will be explored in what follows .",
    "we will refer to the interval @xmath47 $ ] as a time interval . to each vertical segment at sites @xmath48 and",
    "@xmath49 ( i.e. maximal vertical segment above sites @xmath48 and @xmath49 between events ) we have a uniform measure on the two lines being either crossing or parallel .    to each realisation @xmath50 of this poisson point process together with the uniform measure on vertical segments described above there corresponds a set of loops , @xmath51 .",
    "we define loops analogously to @xcite with the different events .",
    "a _ loop _ of length @xmath52 is a map @xmath53_{per}\\to\\tilde{\\lambda}\\times[0,\\beta]_{per}$ ] such that @xmath54 if @xmath55 , @xmath56 is piecewise differentiable with derivative taking values @xmath57 where the derivative exists .",
    "if @xmath58 is a point of non - differentiability then @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "loops with the same support and different parametrisations are identified .",
    "we incorporate the events into loop as follows : start at a point in space - time , @xmath60 , and move upwards , if a bar is met cross it and move downwards at the point the bar joins , if time @xmath61 is met use periodic time conditions to move back round to time @xmath62 .",
    "the loops can be easily understood using pictures , see fig .",
    "[ loopexample ] .",
    "it is also useful for the precise mathematical formulation of loops to understand the single and double bars .",
    "single bars occur between one of the sites @xmath41 and one of the sites @xmath63 , for concreteness let us say they are between sites @xmath48 and @xmath64 .",
    "when we meet this bar whilst moving upwards along the time segment at @xmath48 we cross it to the time segment at @xmath64 and move downwards .",
    "when there are double bars both sites @xmath65 are connected to different sites from @xmath66 .",
    "when moving along a time segment at one of these sites we treat the bars the same as before .",
    ".,width=453 ]    for this loop model we have partition function @xmath67 here @xmath68 is parameter .",
    "@xmath69 is the probability measure corresponding to a poisson point process of intensity @xmath45 for single bars and @xmath35 for double bars , together with a uniform measure on the vertical segments being crossed or parallel .",
    "the relevant probability measure is then @xmath70    we are interested in sets of realisations , @xmath50 , where certain points of @xmath71 $ ] are in the same loop .",

    "b ) : :    the event that @xmath48 and @xmath49 are connected ,    @xmath64 and @xmath77 are connected but there is no    connection from any @xmath72 to any @xmath73",

    "these events both have the same probability .",
    "d ) : :    the event that all four sites @xmath84 are    connected . denoted @xmath85 $ ] .",
    "it is worth noting that unlike in @xcite we will not use special notation to distinguish between whether the loop that heads up from @xmath72 connects to @xmath73 from above or below .",
    "this is because the only events are bars , as we switch direction at bars this means that on a bipartite graph points in the same sublattice can only be connected from below and points in different sublattices can only be connected from above .",
    "sometimes the order in which sites are encountered along the loop will be important . in this case instead of simple lines or broken lines to signify that sites are connected or not connected there will be arrows .",
    "for example @xmath86 $ ] is the event that the four sites are connected , but in what order the loop encounters them is unimportant .",
    "the events @xmath87 $ ] , @xmath88 $ ] and @xmath89 $ ] are the events that all four sites are connected and are encountered along the loop in the order indicated by the arrows ( up to parametrisation of the loop ) . as",
    "this notation is potentially confusing ( but also seemingly unavoidable ) the reader will be told explicitly when the order is important . when wanting the probability of these events we will drop the @xmath90 from the notation , as below .",
    "it is intuitively clear that @xmath91 decays exponentially fast with respect to @xmath92 for @xmath61 small .",
    "hence @xmath93 and @xmath94 must also have exponential decay .",
    "@xmath95 should depend weakly on @xmath92 for small enough @xmath61 .",
    "for @xmath92 large enough the probability may approach @xmath96 , it is not clear how to prove or disprove such a relation at this time .",
    "in order to make the connection with spin systems we need the notion of a _ space - time spin configuration_. the spin system we shall connect to is the spin-1 heisenberg model , we shall make this connection via an intertwining that merges two spin-@xmath2 models .",
    "for this reason we will take @xmath97 from section [ sec loopmodel ] ( @xmath98 for @xmath13 ) .",
    "this is also the reason the lattice @xmath38 has two sites for every site in @xmath7 .",
    "it is also possible to represent the spin-@xmath99 model for general @xmath99 by merging @xmath100 spin-@xmath2 models , this will mean @xmath38 will have @xmath100 sites for every site in @xmath7 .",
    "see @xcite for more details .",
    "this generalisation together with some results analogous to the ones presented here should be straightforward once the spin-1 model is understood .",
    "it is not immediately clear which results will still hold however , investigation is required .",

    "we further define @xmath105 to be the set of all such functions with a finite number of discontinuities . for a realisation of the process",
    "@xmath50 we consider @xmath106 that are constant on the vertical segments of each loop in @xmath51 .",
    "we actually require that the value of @xmath102 changes on crossing a bar in order to make the link with spin systems . when we are dealing only with the loop model we will ignore this extra condition .",
    "we call such configurations _ compatible _ with @xmath50 . denote by @xmath107 the set of all compatible configurations .",
    "we further define the set @xmath108 to be the set of configurations that are constant on each segment of loops not containing @xmath72 or @xmath73 ( and which flip spin on crossing a bar ) . on the loops containing @xmath72 and @xmath73 we have the same requirements of being constant on vertical segments of the loop and flipping spins",
    "when crossing a bar but we relax the conditions imposed at sites @xmath72 and @xmath73 at time @xmath62 , we allow the spin to either be continuous or to flip at zero . from this",
    "we can deduce the following relation : @xmath109 from which we can obtain @xmath110 as in @xcite we will later need a more general setting for the measure on space - time spin configurations . we still consider a poisson point process on @xmath111 $ ] but this time the event will be specifications of the local spin configuration",
    ". we will consider discontinuities involving two pairs of sites ( @xmath84 ) .",
