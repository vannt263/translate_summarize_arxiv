    "in the recent paper @xcite , lamoreaux suggested that application of novel experimental techniques in garnet materials should lead to substantial increase in sensitivity compared to the previous attempt ; this suggestion renewed the interest in the original idea .",

    "this opens a possibility for the precise measurements of the weinberg angle .",
    "there are several issues related to the hypothetical measurements .",
    "the first is the normalization of the effect .",
    "imagine , there are two samples made of different isotopes .",
    "they will be of slightly different shapes and volume , and then one has to perform precise measurements of the usual electric and magnetic susceptibilities to normalize the pnc effect per unit volume .",
    "another issue is related to the possible systematics . at the moment",
    ", we do not see any macroscopic systematic effects that would imitate the pnc magnetization ( [ p5:magn ] ) .",
    "although eq .",
    "( [ p5:magn ] ) , in essence , describes the nonlinear magnetoelectric effect , the crucial feature is that it violates parity at fundamental level . in the lattice with center of inversion",
    ", the usual magnetoelectric effects can not generate this correlation .",
    "a possible source of systematics can be due to the small local imperfections in the lattice which destroy the inversion symmetry .",
    "however such effects are of local nature and should average out to zero in the macroscopic sample with about @xmath186 rare - earth sites .",
    "another serious issue ( @xcite ) is the unknown value of nuclear neutron form factor which appears in the formula for effective nuclear weak charge ",
    "the quantity that is measured in atomic experiments .",
    "electronic matrix element of the operator ( [ p5:wk1 ] ) of weak charge interaction contains the expression @xmath187 averaged over the electron radial wave functions , @xmath188 here is the nuclear density which replaces the dirac delta function in eq .",
    "( [ p5:wk1 ] ) .",
    "it is known , however , that the density distribution is different for neutrons and protons , so the correct expression to be averaged is @xmath189 , where @xmath190 and @xmath191 are the neutron and the proton nuclear density respectively .",
    "thus , in a real experiment one probes the effective weak charge @xmath192 which contains the neutron and proton form factors @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "the form factor @xmath194 can , at least in principle , be measured reliably with electron scattering , in muonic atoms , etc .",
    "it is expressed in terms of the proton distribution root - mean - square ( rms ) radius @xmath195 , which is also the rms radius of nuclear electric charge distribution .",
    "we assume that the uncertainty in the value of @xmath195 is negligible  the neutron rms radius @xmath196 and the neutron form factor @xmath193 are known with much lower precision .",
    "let us estimate the uncertainty in @xmath197 due to uncertainty in the neutron form factor @xmath193 . to be specific ,",
    "let us consider the suggested experiment with dysprosium trifluoride .",
    "there are seven stable isotopes of dy : 156 , 158 , 160 , 161 , 162 , 163 , 164 . the odd and the even isotopes should not be considered together , because the odd isotopes then would give rise to nonmonotonic dependences due to the presence of the unpaired neutron .",
    "clearly , it is best to analyze the even isotopes only .",
    "this leaves dysprosium-156 , 158 , 160 , 162 and 164these are completely paired nuclei with practically the same deformations , so the dependence of @xmath193 on the number of neutrons must be smooth and monotonic .    strictly speaking , in order to find the neutron form factor @xmath193 and the corresponding uncertainty one has to perform calculations of @xmath193 for deformed nucleus in the rotational @xmath198-wave state .",
    "however , to estimate the uncertainty , it is sufficient to use the known formula for spherical nucleus in the `` sharp - edge '' approximation @xcite @xmath199\\ .\\ ] ] the difference @xmath200 was found in ref .",
    "@xcite from analysis of experiments with antiprotonic atoms .",
    "the empirical fit in ref .",
    "@xcite reads : @xmath201= ( -0.04 \\pm 0.03 ) + ( 1.01 \\pm 0.15)\\ , \\frac{n - z}{n+z}\\ \\ . \\label{p5:nfit}\\ ] ] according to this expression the uncertainty in @xmath196 is @xmath202 . from eq.([qn ] ) , uncertainty in the neutron form factor is related to @xmath203 in the following way @xmath204    the experiment with the chain of isotopes in the same compound would be measuring the ratio of @xmath205 ( [ p5:qweff ] ) for two different isotopes with @xmath206 and @xmath207 : @xmath208 and thus , it would allow to eliminate the solid - state pre - factor and the associated theoretical uncertainty .",
    "assuming there is no contribution from experimental error , the uncertainty in @xmath209 that corresponds to the error bounds in the eq .",
    "( [ p5:nfit ] ) is : @xmath210 note , that the uncertainties in @xmath193 and @xmath211 in eq .",
    "( [ p5:qwratio ] ) are correlated according to eqs .",
    "( [ p5:dqn ] ) , ( [ p5:nfit ] ) .",
    "moreover , main contribution to @xmath212 comes from the second term in eq .",
    "( [ p5:nfit ] ) , while contribution of the constant term is negligible .",
    "there is also the experimental uncertainty @xmath213 . in the possible experiment that measures the ratio @xmath214",
    ", this uncertainty translates into the uncertainty @xmath212 in the value of @xmath215 according to the formula : @xmath216 this corresponds to the measurement with two dysprosium isotopes , @xmath217dy and @xmath218dy , @xmath219 . in order to match the uncertainty ( [ p5:s2uncert ] ) ,",
    "the experiment should be carried out with the precision exceeding @xmath220 . according to the estimates ,",
    "statistical considerations allow for precision of the order @xmath221 , or better , depending on the magnetometry technique .    the current experimental precision for the value of @xmath215 measured at @xmath25-peak , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , is @xmath222 .",
    "the solid - state experiment proposed in the present paper could achieve comparable level of precision , and , what is more important , would measure the value of the weinberg angle in the domain of low energies ( effective momentum transfer @xmath223 )",
