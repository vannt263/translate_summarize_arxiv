    "consider the following weighted @xmath0-statistics : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a nonstationary time series , @xmath3 , the kernel @xmath4 and the weights @xmath5 are symmetric and borel measurable functions .",
    "many important time and spectral domain problems in the analysis of nonstationary time series boil down to the investigation of weighted @xmath0-statistics in the form of ( [ eq : ustat ] ) .",
    "for instance , in various situations one may be interested in estimating parameter functions @xmath6 over time @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the marginal distribution of @xmath9 at time @xmath7 . in this case many nonparametric estimators of @xmath10 are asymptotically equivalent to the weighted @xmath0-statistics @xmath11 where @xmath12 is two - dimensional kernel function , and @xmath13 is a bandwidth that restricts the estimation in a neighborhood of @xmath7 . additionally , after the nonparametric fitting one may want to specify or test whether the parameter function is of certain parametric forms .",
    "in this case many @xmath14 distance based test statistics are of the form  ( [ eq : ustat ] ) with degenerate kernels ; that is , kernels @xmath4 such that @xmath15= 0 $ ] for every @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "see , for instance , the @xmath14 distance based quantile specification test in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in spectral analysis of the nonstationary time series @xmath18 , both the periodogram @xmath19 and the classic smoothed periodogram estimate of the spectral density @xmath20 are in the form of ( [ eq : ustat ] ) with kernel @xmath21 . here @xmath22 stands for the imaginary unit , @xmath23 is a kernel function and @xmath24 is a window size satisfying @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "note that in every example above , @xmath27 involves a tuning parameter ( either bandwidth or window size ) which varies with the sample size @xmath28 .",
    "hence it is important to write the weights as a function of @xmath28 in ( [ eq : ustat ] ) .",
    "the purpose of the paper is to establish an asymptotic theory for ( [ eq : ustat ] ) through the angle of fourier analysis . to illustrate the main idea ,",
    "suppose that @xmath29 is absolutely integrable on @xmath30 for some function @xmath31 .",
    "then under mild conditions @xmath32 admits the fourier representation @xmath33 . consequently @xmath34 can be written as @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "note that in ( [ eq : fourier_repre ] ) the complex structure of @xmath34 is reduced to a process of quadratic forms @xmath37 through the aid of fourier transformation .",
    "the multiplicative structure of the quadratic forms makes in - depth asymptotic investigations possible for a wide class of nonstationary time series .",
    "furthermore , the continuous structure of @xmath38 in @xmath17 makes a stochastic equi - continuity and continuous mapping argument possible which is shown to be powerful compared to the discrete spectral decomposition methods used in the literature . with the aid of the above structural simplifications , in this paper we are able to establish a uniform approximation scheme of @xmath39 by a process of gaussian quadratic forms . as a consequence",
    "we establish a unified asymptotic theory for a class of nondegenerate and degenerate weighted @xmath0-statistics with reflexible weight functions .",
    "both central and noncentral limit theorems are developed for a wide class of nonstationary time series with both smoothly and abruptly changing data generating mechanisms over time .",
    "the established theory can be applied to many problems in the study of nonstationary time series , including topics such as nonparametric estimation and specification , periodogram and spectral density inferences discussed above .    in ( [ eq : ustat ] ) , if the summation is taken over indices @xmath40 , then the statistics are commonly called weighted @xmath41-statistics in the literature . for many problems that are of practical importance , statistical theory for the @xmath41- and @xmath0-statistics can be established with essentially the same techniques . since the seminal papers of @xcite and @xcite , the analysis of @xmath0- and @xmath41-statistics has attracted much attention in the statistics and probability literature .",
    "it seems that most efforts have been put in un - weighted @xmath41- or @xmath0-statistics with @xmath42 for stationary data .",
    "see , for instance , @xcite , @xcite , huskova and janssen ( @xcite ) , @xcite , @xcite and beutner and zhle ( @xcite ) for various approaches for nondegenerate and degenerate un - weighted @xmath41- and @xmath0-statistics .",
    "we also refer to the monographs of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for more references .",
    "as we observe from the examples in the beginning of this , it is important to consider weighted @xmath0-statistics with sample size dependent weights in the study of nonstationary time series .",
    "there are a small number of papers discussing weighted @xmath0- or @xmath41-statistics in the literature .",
    "see , for instance , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for weighted @xmath41- and @xmath0-statistics of independent data and @xcite for weighted nondegenerate @xmath41-statistics of stationary time series . for most of the above discussions ,",
    "the weights are not allowed to be sample size dependent .",
    "exceptions include @xcite who discovered a very deep result that @xmath43 implies asymptotic normality of a very wide class of weighted degenerate @xmath0-statistics for independent data , where @xmath44 is the eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath45 with the maximum absolute value .",
    "there the proof heavily depended on the martingale structure of degenerate @xmath0-statistics of independent data and is hard to generalize to the time series setting . in this paper , from a fourier analysis angle , we generalize the result of @xcite and show that , for many temporally dependent processes , @xmath46 implies asymptotic normality of @xmath34 for a class of degenerate kernels and weight functions .",
    "quadratic forms are special cases of ( [ eq : ustat ] ) with @xmath21 .",
    "there are many papers in the literature devoted to the analysis of such statistics .",
    "see , for instance , @xcite , @xcite , gtze and tikhomirov ( @xcite ) , @xcite and bhansali , giraitis and kokoszka ( @xcite ) , among others .",
    "it seems that most of the results are on independent or stationary data .",
    "exceptions include @xcite who recently studied asymptotic normality of a class of quadratic forms with banded weight matrix for @xmath47-mixing nonstationary time series . for independent data , gtze and tikhomirov ( @xcite ) , among others , established deep theoretical results indicating that distributions of generic quadratic forms can be approximated by those of corresponding gaussian quadratic forms . in this paper",
    ", we generalize this type of result and show that the laws of a wide class of quadratic forms for nonstationary time series can be well approximated by the distributions of corresponding quadratic forms of independent gaussian random variables .",
    "consequently , central and noncentral limit theorems are established for the latter class of quadratic forms for nonstationary time series .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : pre ] we shall introduce the class of absolutely convergent fourier transformations and the piece - wise locally stationary time series models used in this paper .",
    "sections  [ sec : nondegen ] and [ sec : degen ] establish the asymptotic theory for nondegenerate and degenerate @xmath0-statistics , respectively . theory for quadratic forms will be covered in section  [ sec : degen ] as a special case of degenerate @xmath0-statistics . in section  [ sec : app ] , we shall apply our theory to the problems of nonparametric estimation as well as spectral analysis of nonstationary processes .",
    "several examples will be discussed in detail . finally , the theoretical results are proved in section  [ sec : proof ] .",
