    "we present a survey to detect extragalactic radio sources at 43 ghz with repeated independent pointings of the d - configuration vla in snapshot mode .",
    "the survey is centered on elais - n2 ( ra  16h  36 m  48s , dec + 41  01  45  , j2000 ) , and covers about 0.5  down to 7  mjy .",
    "the primary objective was to establish the 43-ghz source surface density at mjy levels , an issue of importance in assessing the discrete - source foreground contamination of the cmb signal .",
    "it is only recently that we have gained insight into what populates the radio sky at survey frequencies above 5  ghz . by this frequency",
    "some 60 per cent of the sources at jy levels have ` flat ' spectra ( @xmath3 , where flux density @xmath4 is related to frequency @xmath5 via @xmath6 ) over some region of the radio domain .",
    "this is the signature of optically - thick synchrotron emission and compact structure , so - called ` flat - spectrum ' sources .",
    "( surveys at frequencies above 150  ghz do find inverted - spectrum sources presumably dominated by free - free emission , probably dust emitters related to or part of the sub - mm galaxy population .",
    "these do not appear at frequencies as low as 43  ghz  see viera et al .",
    "flat - spectrum ' objects do not generally have @xmath7 over a large frequency range ; rather their spectra show inversions , points of inflection , and sometimes single peaks ( e.g. gigahertz - peaked spectra or gps sources ) .",
    "the optical counterparts of the great majority of these sources are stellar in appearance and are flat - spectrum radio qsos ( fsrqs ) or bllac objects .",
    "how rapidly does this trend to such objects and away from conventional steep - spectrum  generally optically - thin spectrum radio galaxies  continue with increasing frequency above 5  ghz ?",
    "when and at what flux - density level do we find new populations of flat or inverted - spectrum objects ?",
    "the pioneering survey of brandie & bridle ( 1974 ) covered 0.8  sterad at 8  ghz and found 55 sources , of which `` more than 2/3 '' were stellar objects , i.e. qsos or bllac objects .",
    "subsequent deep surveys by windhorst et al .",
    "( 1993 ) enabled definition of an 8.4-ghz source count down to 10  @xmath8jy .",
    "brandie and bridle found that at their relatively high flux densities , 70 per  cent of the sources have flat or inverted spectra .",
    "some spectrally - extreme sources certainly exist ",
    "edge et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found two with spectral peaks at @xmath9  20  ghz  but the proportion of such objects to be detected in very high frequency surveys remains unknown .",
    "the first ventures at higher frequencies were to search for contaminants to cmb experiments , with the ryle telescope survey at 15  ghz leading the way .",
    "taylor et al .",
    "( 2001 ) found 66 sources in 63  above 20  mjy .",
    "the continuation of this came to be the cambridge 9c survey ( waldram et al . 2003 ; bolton et al .",
    "2004 ; waldram et al .",
    "some 465 sources were catalogued above 25 mjy in 520 .",
    "examination of a subset of these sources ( bolton et al .",
    "2004 ) revealed that ( a ) at a flux limit of 25  mjy 18 per cent show spectra that peak at 5 ghz or above ; and ( b ) at 60  mjy 27 per cent peak at 5  ghz or above , and increasing the flux limit increases the fraction of rising - spectrum sources .",
    "( the statistical dependence of radio spectrum on flux - density level has been discovered relatively regularly since 1970 ; see e.g. kellermann & wall 1987 . )",
    "colours and the stellar nature of optical counterparts indicate that between a third and a half of the peaked - spectrum sources are qsos .",
    "the major contribution to surveys and samples at these higher frequencies has come from at20 g , the large - area 20-ghz survey with the australia telescope compact array ( ricci et al 2004 ; sadler et al . 2006 ; massardi et al .",
    "2008 ) . by 2007",
    "the survey had covered @xmath10",
    "@xmath11  cataloguing 4400 sources down to @xmath250  mjy ; another 1500 are expected in the final survey zone @xmath12@xmath13 .",
    "these catalogues will render incorrect the statements made at the start of each of these papers about our poor knowledge of the high - frequency radio sky .",
    "massardi et al .",
    "studied the 320 brightest sources from the 2007 version of the catalogue .",
    "the major conclusions do not differ dramatically from those from 9c : ( a ) most sources do not show power - law spectra ; ( b ) the spectral complexity ensures that it is impossible to select a low - frequency sample which will constitute a complete high - frequency sample ; ( c ) spectral steepening is common and correlates with redshift , perhaps due to changing rest frame frequency ; ( d ) 77 per cent of the brightest - source sample are qsos , 19 per cent are galaxies , and the remainder are blank on the supercosmos sky survey ( sss ; see _",
    "www-wfau.roe.ac.uk/sss/_ ) scanned versions of the ukstu plates .",
    "the galaxies have a median @xmath14 = 17.7 , the qsos 18.6  these medians lie far above the plate limits",
    ".    further characterization of the source population at high frequencies has come from multi - frequency flux - density measurements of sources detected in the wmap ( wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ) cmb surveys .",
    "wmap has produced complete samples of the brightest radio sources over the sky to a flux - density limit of about 2 jy at each of its primary frequencies 23 , 33 , 43 , 61 and 94 ghz ( hinshaw et al . 2007 ; lpez - caniego et al . 2007 ; wright et al .",
    "2009 ) . with measurements at 16 and 33 ghz using the vsa and ami , davies et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and franzen et al .",
    "( 2009 ) found the following for a sample complete to 1.1  jy at 33 ghz : ( 1 ) the proportion of flat - spectrum objects is very high : 93 per cent have spectra with @xmath15 ; ( 2 ) 44 per cent have @xmath16 , i.e. rising spectra ; ( 3 ) the variable - source bias ( a selection effect which mimics an eddington bias ; see wall et al .",
    "2005 ; wall 2007 ) is in clear evidence from comparing repeated wmap and ami 33-ghz flux densities ; ( 3 ) on timescales of @xmath21.5yr , 20 per cent of sources varied by more than 20 per cent at 33 ghz with a high degree of correlation between variation at 16 and 33 ghz ; and ( 4 ) variable sources have a marginally flatter spectrum ( @xmath17 ) than non - variable sources ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "sadler et al . ( 2008 ) attempted to characterize the populations to be found at yet higher frequencies . with flux densities measured for 130 sources at 95 ghz and 20  ghz with the atca",
    ", the resultant distribution of spectral indices together with source counts from at20 g was used to predict the source count at 95 ghz above a level of 100 mjy .",
    "this prediction is lower than that from models of luminosity functions and evolution ( de zotti et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the authors conclude that this is due to the fact that the majority of sources with flat or rising spectra over the range 5 to 20  ghz show a spectral turnover between 20 and 95  ghz .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to describe a limited survey at mjy levels at 43.4 ghz with the vla , and to use this to construct a source count at this frequency .",
    "we want to see if there is evidence for emergent new populations that might affect future cmb experiments such as planck .",
    "in addition we wish to track the space density of the different classes of object which emerge as survey frequency is raised , and for this , a source count is an essential complement to radio and optical spectral data .",
    "descriptions of this space density for _ combined _ populations of flat - spectrum objects have been obtained ( e.g de zotti et al .",
    "2005 ; wall et al .",
    "2005 ; ricci et al .",
    "2006 ) , but not for the individual ( e.g. gps ) populations .",
    "with regard to a source count at 43 ghz , the wmap all - sky survey at 43  ghz defined the high - flux - density end of the count as well as it can ever be done . to extend the 43-ghz count to lower flux levels , waldram et al .",
    "( 2007 ) used their 15-ghz 9c survey plus spectral information to predict source counts at this frequency ( as well as at several other frequencies ) . at a somewhat lower frequency ,",
    "mason et al .",
    "( 2009 ) measured flux densities at 31 ghz for 3165 nvss sources using the green bank 100 m and the owens valley 40 m telescopes . from these measurements they projected an integral source count at 31  ghz in the range 1 to 4  mjy , and found that the surface densities implied account for @xmath19 per cent of the amplitude of the power detected in excess of intrinsic anisotropy by the cosmic background imager ( cbi ) at @xmath20 .",
    "we return to these results in   [ scest ] and   [ disc ] .",
    "surveying at frequencies as high as 43  ghz is not straightforward , as this pilot study will demonstrate .",
    "hence this paper does not follow the conventional survey , analysis , catalogue , source - count etc . route ",
    "the data do not lend themselves to such a procedure .",
    "we thus present a road map for orientation .    1 .   ",
    "[ surdes ] _ survey design _ considers why we chose the region elais n2 and how we came to the plan for coverage in terms of independent snapshots of given cycle parameters .",
    "the appendix a1 describes an analysis leading to this design . 2 .",
    "_ observations and reductions _ (   [ obsred ] ) constitutes the conventional part of the paper .",
    "we used standard aips analysis routines .",
    "the 1627 independent snapshot images show many source - like deflections , as decribed in ",
    "[ obsred ] . with our lack of knowledge of the sky at 43  ghz",
    ", we try in   [ dets ] , _ finding real sources _ to use as many avenues as possible to explore the reality of these deflections . to do so , we select a sample of deflections from all snapshot images down to a level of 3 times the rms noise level on each image .",
    "it is essential to emphasize at the outset that _ we never use a 3@xmath21 sample in a source - counting process _",
    ", as the effects of eddington bias are lethal at such levels .",
    "however the sample gives us the broadest scope to establish the frequency of real detections , and we try to do this by examining the statistics of the sample , the coincidences of deflections with known sources from radio catalogues at other frequencies , and the coincidences with optical counterparts using the palomar ii sky survey and the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "4 .   the minimal returns from the exercises of   [ dets ] led us to consider how to use the survey data to estimate the source count at 43  ghz .",
    "we do so in ",
    "[ scest ] by analyzing the imprint of the primary beam shape on the expected radial distribution of sources in the collective images , and we develop a technique for this that uses _ each deflection _ , real or otherwise , in a maximum - likelihood analysis .",
    "finally (   [ disc ] ) we compare the results of this analysis with estimates of counts at other mm - wavelength frequencies .",
    "we chose the elais n2 region as having a wealth of information available from surveys at radio to x - ray wavelengths ( see e.g. rowan - robinson et al .",
    "moreover a bright calibrator ( 3c345 , 1642 + 398 ) stands close by , essential for observations at this frequency .    to find the maximum number of sources , given source counts of slopes with which we are familiar in the radio regime ,",
    "the worst survey strategy is a single deep exposure , which we estimate would have yielded @xmath22  0.05 sources in the primary beam ( 1.00 arcmin full - width half - maximum = fwhm ) area , assuming a 24-h integration and an rms of 250  @xmath8jy in 10  min . at radio wavelengths",
    ", wide and shallow always beats narrow and deep ; an analysis in appendix  a1 quantifies this and shows that our adoption of the nvss observing cycle ( 23  sec integration , 7  sec telescope settle ) is near optimal for a series of independent snapshots .",
    "we estimated from the ryle telescope 15-ghz source count available at the time that observing 2880 fields in 24h should yield about 5  sources at a 4  mjy ( @xmath23 ) survey limit .",
    "there is no significant difficulty in analysis of such a number of fields ; this is essentially a mapping process and the general emptiness of the sky at 43  ghz implies that almost no deconvolution is required .",
    "we used the technique of ` referenced pointing ' ( see www.vla.nrao.edu/memos/test/189/ ) to position the primary beam with an accuracy of better than 5 arcsec .",
    "the observations were made in late 2001 , at which time all vla antennas had been newly equipped with 43-ghz receiving systems . in order to maximize sensitivity to extended emission and to minimize the effects of the atmosphere on phase stability , we used the the smallest vla , i.e. the d configuration ; and we observed in november , as the necessary phase stability at this frequency is generally available only in winter .",
    "we observed in 4 6-hour runs to keep to higher elevations , so as to minimize atmospheric effects .    during the 24 hours of observing allocated to the programme",
    ", we made 1627 independent snapshot observations , on the grid shown in fig .",
    "[ obsgrid ] .",
    "field centres are separated by 120 arcsec , twice the primary - beam fwhm .",
    "the observations were carried out 02 , 03 , 12 and 23 nov , 2001 , in outstanding weather conditions for the first three sessions , clear or less than 20 per cent cloud .",
    "the final 8-hour session was disrupted by rain , snow and cloud , with wind forcing the array to be stowed for much of this period .",
    "this resulted in the gap at the central declinations of fig .",
    "[ obsgrid ] .",
    "about 19.0 useable hours of observations were obtained as judged from the phase stability , and out of 24h this is good fortune at frequencies as high as 43  ghz .",
    "the primary beam fwhm is 1.00 arcmin and the synthesized beam fwhm 2.3 arcsec .",
    "the phase calibrator 3c345 ( 1642 + 398 ) was observed approximately every 30 minutes . for flux density calibration ,",
    "once or twice per session we observed 3c286 ( 1331 + 305 ) , with a flux density of 1.45  jy at 43.4 ghz .",
    "the effects of slight resolution at this frequency were removed via the appropriate vla model supplied in the nrao aips software package .",
    "we used standard aips procedures in the analysis . at each field centre we made a map of @xmath24 pixels each 0.2 arcsec square , total map extent @xmath25 arcmin .",
    "we used a minimal clean ( 100 cycles , gain=0.1 , @xmath2280 components @xmath91  mjy ) on each map ; this procedure unfortunately proved necessary in order to use subsequent aips routines , which require cleaned data as input . in order to examine whether our phase calibration every @xmath2630 minutes was adequate , and in particular to look at potential decorrelation , we carried out a simple experiment on the phase calibration data of the observing day 12 nov 2001",
    "the phase calibrator was observed for one minute at ut times of 17:11 , 17:28 , 17:47 , 18:04 , 18:27 and 18:43 .",
    "using aips and doctoring the input files , we made three measures of the calibrator flux density , assuming it was a programme source and using phase calibrators either side of it for flux calibration .",
    "we thus made a measure of the flux of 1642 + 398 at 17:28 using the 17:11 and 17:47 observations alone as flux calibrators , and so on for meaures of 1642 + 398 at time of 18:04 and 18:27 .",
    "the three values of flux density obtained differed from the input value ( 9.11 jy at 43.4 ghz ) by + 1.5% , + 0.1% and + 2.7% .",
    "we concluded that calibration was satisfactory ; these differences are insignificant in comparison with the noise and resolution effects measured for the source - like deflections encountered in the survey .",
    "the final 1627 maps have a median rms of 1.4 mjy , close to that estimated for the survey .",
    "the lowest noise maps have an rms of 0.9 mjy ; 67 per cent have rms noise @xmath27  mjy and 98 per cent @xmath28  mjy .",
    "inspection of the maps shows a number of low - level striations well under the rms noise level , and responses , many of which look source - like .",
    "the responses happen because the receiver or sky noise is only introduced at points with measurements in the @xmath29 plane . for snapshot observations in particular",
    ", this means that with noise partially correlated between antennas the images will show apparently coherent structure even in the absence of any real sources",
    ". this will be in the form of intersecting ripples of various periods ( one per @xmath29 point ) with amplitude and phase fluctuating between observations .",
    "responses , fictitious sources , are most easily generated where these ripples intersect .",
    "if all source - like responses are spurious and due to receiver noise as described , then there is no imprint of the primary beam in the image from each snapshot , a point discussed in detail in ",
    "[ stats ] and   [ scest ] .",
    "most of these responses are very extended to the 2.3-arcsec beam but many look like unresolved sources .",
    "we consider this issue in the following section .    in short ,",
    "the autocorrelation function of the images is not remotely gaussian , although the rms noise ( in good weather conditions ) is close to that predicted from telescope and instrumentation parameters .",
    "the total area covered as a function of flux density was calculated by considering each snapshot field separately , the primary beam and the rms flux density , and adding up the areas available to detect flux density for point sources above given signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) . the resulting curves of area versus sensitivity are shown in figure  [ area_mjy ] .",
    "we applied the aips routine sad to each map to search for sources , setting a flux limit of 3.0 mjy .",
    "we then removed from the subsequent list all objects with peak flux - density to noise ratio below 3.0 .",
    "this gave us a uniform set of 54225 deflections ( an average of 33 per field ) .",
    "of course a 3@xmath21 limit is far too low if we were selecting responses for a source list based on s / n alone . under such circumstances ,",
    "eddington bias is extremely damaging and even a 4@xmath21 limit results in significant contamination of a source list with noise peaks .",
    "however , here we are simply selecting a sample to search for possible detections using criteria other than s / n .",
    "the net result of the extensive searches described below is one secure 43-ghz source , the previously catalogued qso 16382 + 414 with s@xmath30 = 26  mjy , and several possible 43-ghz sources coinciding with either blue stellar objects or sources previously catalogued at 1.4  ghz .",
    "we reasoned towards establishing real sources detected in the survey via the following steps .",
    "[ rat ] shows a diagram for the 54225 ` sources ' with ratio of integrated to peak emission ( ` size factor ' or sf ) as a function of peak flux density .",
    "the diagram demonstrates that attention should be confined to those objects for which this flux ratio is less than 2 , and that there may be a set of unresolved detections at @xmath31  mjy , @xmath32 sf @xmath33 whose reality needs to be examined further .",
    "responses narrower than the synthesized beam , sf @xmath34 0.5 , are probably spurious ; a number are clearly single - pixel fluctuations .",
    "we examined a fair sample of the ` detections ' both extended and apparently point - like , via visual inspection and profiling of a sample of @xmath35 detections on the synthesized maps .",
    "most do not look convincing , sitting astride response lines or at the junctions of these lines .",
    "there is good reason to confine our attention to the compact ` objects ' .",
    "all extended - emission radio sources are known to have synchrotron @xmath2 power - law spectra of spectral index @xmath36 , so that sources detected at 43 ghz will almost certainly not show extended emission or be associated with extended radio objects detected at lower frequencies .",
    "moreover many if not most such extended objects would be resolved out by the 2.3-arcsec synthesized beam of the survey .",
    "we are looking for compact objects , qsos or bllac objects with flat , inverted and/or variable spectra , probably beamed , and with structures on milliarcsec vlbi scales . however in the interests of objectivity the first of our investigations here retains the entire sample of 54225 responses .",
    "figure  [ speak ] argues strongly against the reality of most of these ` sources ' , even the stronger ones .",
    "here deflection height is plotted against @xmath37 , the square of the distance from the individual field centres in arcsec .",
    "this is effectively area , so that the plot should be uniform if the deflections are random results , e.g. of intersecting response lines .",
    "the vertical lines show the value of @xmath37 corresponding to the primary - beam half - power point , @xmath37 corresponding to twice this , and @xmath37 corresponding to half the width of the synthesized square .",
    "deflections corresponding to real sources should be concentrated within @xmath38 , and few if any should appear beyond @xmath39 .",
    "the deflections , compact or extended , appear to be depressingly uniform across the full extent of @xmath37 .",
    "we must conclude that the vast majority can not represent real sources .",
    "we compared all 54225 ` source ' positions with those for radio sources in the elais  n2 catalogue ( rowan - robinson et al .",
    "2004 ) from the 1.4-ghz deep surveys of this region ( ciliegi et al . 1999 ; ivison et al . 2002 ; biggs & ivison 2006 ) , and with the sources of the first survey ( becker et al .",
    "1995 ) there were a total of 538 such sources within our synthesized area ( figure  [ obsgrid ] ) .",
    "we confined attention to those within 10 arcsec of catalogued sources ; the properties of these objects were found not to differ from the others .",
    "we then examined carefully all the objects lying within 2 arcsec of the catalogued sources .",
    "the total coincidence area corresponding to 2 arcsec radius suggests a possible 5.4 coincidences due to chance .",
    "we found a total of 15 such coincidences .",
    "we then confined attention to objects with size factors of 1.5 or less ; the list of such coincidences totalled six .",
    "( with regard to this sf @xmath40 upper limit , it could be argued that it should be relaxed to somewhat larger values at lower signal - to - noise .",
    "we carried out monte - carlo trials , and found that although as expected for point sources there is a distinct increase in observed sf for true point sources as signal - to - noise is lowered to the @xmath1 threshold , only some 5 per cent of the trials yielded sf values above 1.5 .",
    "thus the above list of 6 possible coincidences above may be short by half - a - source statistically ; but on the other hand , relaxing the criterion feeds in a far greater proportion of assuredly spurious ` detections ' . )    of these 6 coincidences within 2 arcsec , we rejected two as possibilities because the first 1.4-ghz contour maps suggest that the catalogued source is a component of a double - structure radio source .",
    "an inverted radio spectrum object has never been seen as a lobe of a double radio source and it is thus highly unlikely that the 43-ghz deflection is real . of the remaining four sources , three lie more than 60 arcsec from their field centres , and none has a candidate optical identification down to the limits of the sdss ( sloan digital sky survey ) .",
    "the probability of finding real sources beyond one fwhm from the beam centre is minimal , and in each case , supposing the source is real , the beam correction would result in flux densities at 43 ghz of from 120mjy to @xmath411jy .",
    "such extreme spectrum objects would have been detected should they exist ; and the lack of any optical counterpart above sdss limits results in a further drastic reduction in probablity that these objects are anything other than artifacts .",
    "the closest of these to the field centre , 16392 + 408 , lies 62 arcsec off axis , and correction for the primary beam attenuation would give it a flux density at 43.4 ghz of @xmath2120  mjy .",
    "the coincident first source has a flux density of 22.1  mjy at 1.4  ghz .",
    "it is entered in table  [ coinc_all ] as a candidate source , albeit an improbable one .    of the 6",
    ", this leaves one final coincidence to consider , and here there is no doubt of the reality of the source at 43.4 ghz ; it has a s / n of 9.6 .",
    "the object is 16382 + 414 , a flat - spectrum qso known to have a redshift of 2.2 , apparently variable as the ciliegi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and first flux densities ( 24.3 and 37.3  mjy respectively at 1.4 ghz ) differ significantly .",
    "the details of this object are in table  [ coinc_all ] ( bold typeface ) .",
    "this real source is the strongest compact response within @xmath42  fwhm = 30  arcsec of the individual field centres .",
    "it may be slightly extended to the 2.3-arcsec sysnthesized beam .",
    "the yield ( of @xmath2one coincidence ) is small but instructive .",
    "the secure coincidence with 16382 + 414 guarantees that the survey and reduction procedure is capable of finding real sources .",
    "it also ensures that the coordinate systems are in coicidence to better than 1 arcsec , so that other coincidences , either with previously catalogued radio sources or with optical identifications , are possible .",
    "it does not rule out the possibility that some ` sources ' close to the @xmath35 limit in s / n are real , but the coincidence results plus figures  [ rat ] and  [ speak ] indicate that the great majority are not .",
    "the at20 g survey ( ricci et al . 2004 ; sadler et al .",
    "2006 ; massardi et al .",
    "2008 ) suggests that compact objects over the range of flux densities sampled by the survey ( 20 - 500 mjy at 20  ghz ) are identified predominantly ( 50 to 80 percent ) with blue stellar objects , qsos or bllacs .",
    "a small proportion is identified with relatively bright galaxies .",
    "a further way then of searching for real sources amongst the 54225 deflections is to look for optical coincidences , primarily stellar counterparts .",
    "it is possible to do this in bulk because of the ease with which automated comparisons can be done with both possii and ukstu sky surveys , thanks to the supercosmos sky survey ( sss ) .    to carry this out , we reduced the sample of 54225 as follows .",
    "we first placed a stringent sf criterion to confine ourselves to compact ` detections ' , using only those ",
    "sourceswith @xmath43 .",
    "this reduced the sample to 26090 .",
    "( again it could be argued that we are throwing away possible real sources because of the increasing spread in sf at lower signal - to - noise ; again we argue that we are after a set of unambiguous detections , which if present would lead us to carry out a more rigorous source cataloguing process .",
    "we found no encouragement to do this . )",
    "we then threw away responses in the field ` corners ' by setting a generous radius limit of 80 arcsec , ( c.f .",
    "half - power beamwidth of 60 arcsec ) ; deflections further off centre than this require ( poorly known ) beam - factor corrections so large as to make them jy - level sources .",
    "the sample is now 16331 in size .",
    "we examined all 16331 position on sss r - band images , easy to automated with the provision of object catalogues in the sss download which list magnitudes , positions , and object type ( galaxy / stellar discrimination ) for all objects above the detection limit in each postage - stamp image .",

    "the excess in the central circle now runs at @xmath52 ; there are 10 objects and the mean value is 3 .",

    "in fact the radial distribution of the 26 objects relative to their field centres is as follows : within 20 arcsec  2 , between 20 and 40 arcsec  4 , between 40 and 60 arcsec  10 ; between 60 and 80 arcsec  10 .",
    "the corresponding numbers for random distribution , i.e. according to annular area , are 2 , 5 , 8 and 11 .",

    "we have to conclude that the majority and possibly all of these candidate identifications ( exept for the known qso ) are chance coincidences , with the high response in the central bin of figure  [ rad_dist_ids ] ( right panel ) a statistical anomaly .",

    "we now add a random uniform background of fake ` sources ' , at a density of @xmath107 sources per unit area .",

    "the only point we now need to address is how to do this for 1627 fields combined , the problem being that each field has a different value of @xmath70 , the detection limit , because each field has a different value of rms noise .",
    "the path towards this is straightforward , as shown in fig .",

    "with the same number of randoms in each field , the likelihood function thus broadens rapidly with increasing @xmath70 .",
    "likelihoods are multiplicative , so that only addition ( and normalization ) of the likelihood functions computed for all fields is required .",

    ", we again reduced the total number of sources by limiting the total list of @xmath113 detections to those which could be point - like .",
    "we adopted the slightly more stringent limits of @xmath114 , yielding a total of 26090 ` sources ' . plotting these in a histogram analogous to figure  [ sim ] showed no indication of an increased surface density at the smaller radii , a clear indication that the likelihood calculation will yield only an upper limit to @xmath78 . because individual fields have very small numbers of objects ( mean = 26090/1627 or @xmath115 ) on which to perform the likelihood calculations , we ordered the fields according to their rms values and added them together in 74 batches of 22 .",
    "we then used the mean value of the rms=@xmath21 for each batch of 22 to calculate a single value of @xmath116 for each group of 22 fields .",
    "we adopted a 60 arcsec beam and a value of @xmath117 from the estimate of waldram et al .",
    "we calculated the likelihood function for each of the 74 batches for a range of values of @xmath78 , and summed the results .",
    "the final curve of @xmath102 vs @xmath78 is shown in figure  [ likfn ] .    when converted to probabilities ,",
    "this curve allows the construction of an integral source count probability region at 43 ghz ( figure  [ sc43 ] ) in the following way .",
    "because the likelihood function curve ( fig .  [ likfn ] ) has no minimum , i.e. the imprint of the beam function is not seen against the background of ( almost completely ) spurious ` sources ' , the likelihood calculation only provides an upper limit to @xmath78 .",
    "translating the likelhood function into probabilities yields the upper - bound probability contours in fig .",
    "[ sc43 ] . as for the lower - limit probability contours ,",
    "we know that the survey found a minimum of one source ( 16382 + 414 ) . knowing the total area covered ( figure  [ area_mjy ] ) , from poisson statistics we can compute a lower - limit set of probability contours for surface density",

    "most can be eliminated on this basis , and on the basis that they are extended to the 2.3 arcsec synthesized beam .",

    "these putative 6 sources all must have extreme inverted spectra because stacking suggests that the average flux density at 1.4  ghz must be below 0.1 mjy .",
    "we have developed a likelihood method to estimate source counts in a synthesis survey which has thrown up a combination of real and random sources .",
    "the method examines the radial distribution in each synthesized field , and because the real sources should decrease with radial distance from the field centre in a predictable manner , in principle both the source - count normalization and the source count power - law index can be determined . with this process ,",
    "neither detailed cataloguing of the sources nor _ a priori _ decisions about which deflections are real are necessary .",

    "the issue can be quantified , quoting the analysis communicated to us by jim condon .",
    "the nvss spacing is overlapped just enough to provide nearly uniform sensitivity to ensure _ completeness _ down to a fixed limit ( e.g. , 2.5 mjy / beam ) over areas @xmath146 beam solid angle . to maximize the number of detections in a _ representative",
    "_ sample without achieving completeness , the optimum spacing is anything large enough that successive snapshots have no overlap ( i.e. @xmath147 fwhm ) .",
    "then , instead of a survey with uniform sensitivity , the yield is a survey covering a small area with high sensitivity and larger areas with lower sensitivity .",
    "the nvss spacing gives the same sensitivity as the on - axis sensitivity of a single snapshot over an effective area of 1/2 the beam solid angle , or @xmath148 for a gaussian beam with fwhm @xmath149 ( condon et al .",
    "a single isolated snapshot has sensitivity directly proportional to the primary power pattern .",
    "since the source counts are roughly power - law with a differential slope of @xmath150 ( integral slope of @xmath151 ) , the number of detectable sources in the isolated snapshot will be proportional to the whole beam solid angle @xmath152 .",
    "thus the yield per unit time with non - overlapping snapshots is _ twice _ that with snapshots overlapped as for the nvss gridding .",
