    "in @xcite , tomei constructed a compact and orientable smooth manifold as an iso - spectral real manifold generated by the toda lattice equation on the set of the tridiagonal symmetric matrices .",
    "let us begin with a brief description of this manifold : let @xmath2 be the set of @xmath3 tridiagonal trace zero matrices , @xmath4 according to the signs of @xmath5 s , the set @xmath2 is a disjoint union of @xmath6 connected components ; @xmath7 where the set of signs is defined by @xmath8 an isospectral leaf is a subset of @xmath2 consisting of tridiagonal marices with fixed eigenvalues @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "we consider in this paper only the case with distinct eigenvalues .",
    "any point of the leaf is obtained from the diagonal matrix @xmath11 by conjugation , that is , they lies on an orbit of the adjoint action of the group of orthogonal matrices on the set of symmeric matrices , @xmath12 the toda lattice is given by the following matrix equation for @xmath13 with a parameter @xmath14 , @xmath15\\ ] ] where the matrix @xmath16 is the skew symmetrizaion of @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath18 with @xmath19 the upper ( lower ) triangular part of @xmath17 .",
    "the solution defines an orbit in @xmath20 , @xmath21 where the matrix function @xmath22 is given by the qr - factorization of the matrix @xmath23 , @xmath24 with an upper triangular matrix @xmath25 .",
    "the isospectral leaf can be also expressed as the inverse image of the symmetric polynomials @xmath26 of the eigenvalues , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the image of the chevalley invariants @xmath29 defined in the characteristic polynomial of the matrix @xmath30 , @xmath31 it is then an easy exercise that the @xmath32 s are the polynomial functions of @xmath33 s and @xmath34 s , i.e. @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",
    "this implies that each connected component @xmath37 labeled by the signs of @xmath5 s is just a copy of one single component , say @xmath38 having all @xmath39 ( in section 2 , the topology of @xmath38 and its closure @xmath40 will be discussed in detail ) .",
    "then tomei s manifold is considered as a smooth compactification of those components under a prescribed gluing through the boundaries , in fact , the manifold has a @xmath41-decomposition with the cells marked by sequences of signs and zeros of @xmath5 s .",
    "the smoothness of the manifold was shown by giving local charts using the toda flow ( lemma 2.1 , 2.2 in @xcite ) .",
    "this can be also shown by considering the manifold as a morse complex associated with the toda flow which gives a _ gradient - like _ flow on the manifold . the morse function @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the closure of the isospectral set ( see also @xcite for the morse functions for the generalized toda lattices on the semisimple lie algebras ) .",
    "all the critical points of the function are then given by the diagonal matrices with the @xmath45 permutation of @xmath46 , i.e. all @xmath47 .",
    "one can also show that near the critical point @xmath48 with a permutation @xmath49 , the symmetry group of order @xmath50 , the morse function takes the form , @xmath51 this formula is useful for identifying all the handle bodies in the morse decomposition of the manifold .",
    "however , our primary interest in this paper is not morse theory ; we will leave that for a future communication .    in this paper",
    ", we consider an extension of this tomei manifold based on a twisted action of the weyl group , the symmetry group for the example of this section .",
    "we start with the theorem due to bloch et al in the case of a lie algebra of type @xmath52 @xcite ( which is summarized in its general lie theoretic setting in subsection [ moment ] below ) :    the imbedding @xmath53 .",
    "[ rembfr ]    the isospectral manifold @xmath40 in ( [ zgamma ] ) is the closure of a generic noncompact torus orbit in @xmath20 of ( [ orbit ] ) , with an action which does not agree with usual action of a split cartan subgroup ( the real diagonal matrices of determinant one ) on @xmath40 .",
    "this poses a difficulty in the application of a convexity theorem of atiyah in @xcite to this situation .",
    "however there is another imbedding @xmath53 described in @xcite which corrects this difficulty .",
    "the following is an @xmath52 version of the main theorem in @xcite :    [ bfrconvexity ]    theere is an imbedding @xmath54 such that its image is the closure of an orbit under the usual action of real diagonal matrices of determinant one ( a split cartan subgroup ) .",
    "using atiyah s theorem @xcite , the image of the moment map @xmath55 where @xmath56 is orthogonal projection , is the convex polytope with vertices at the critical points of the morse function ( [ morse ] ) , that is , of the orbit of the weyl group @xmath57 of the lie algebra @xmath58 .",
    "the theorem can be applied to each isospectral leaf @xmath59 with different signs @xmath60 of ( [ sign ] ) .",
    "then tomei s manifold @xmath61 is the union of those convex polytopes attached along the boundaries , and the weyl group acts on each polytope independently .",
    "thus the tomei manifold can be described as the union of the polytopes @xmath62 associated with the isospectral leaves @xmath63 , @xmath64 the main idea of the present paper is to consider a twisted action of the weyl group on the signs in @xmath65 , and based on this group action with specific sign change , we construct a smooth gluing between the weyl chambers inside the polytopes with different signs .",
    "this is consistent with the toda flow , since the morse function generating the flow depends only on @xmath66 and so does the toda flow .",
    "note that a point of the change of signs occurs at the same point on the same chamber walls of the polytopes with corresponding signs , so that the resulting flow stays smooth and provides a smooth gluing along the chamber walls .",
    "let us explain the result with an explicit example of @xmath67 .",
    "the polytope is then the hexagon with the six vertices corresponding to the permutation of @xmath68 , which are the critical points of the morse function ( [ morse ] ) .",
    "we here assume @xmath69 .",
    "each weyl chamber contains one critical point which is marked by the corresponding element of the weyl group .",
    "in particular , the critical point in the dominant chamber is associated with the fixed point @xmath70 of the toda flow .",
    "the polytope @xmath71 is now devided into the six weyl chambers @xmath72 , and we let denote @xmath62 the polytope which has the sign @xmath73 in the dominant chamber and has a prescribed gluing along the inner walls of the chambers , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the closure of @xmath76 ( see figure [ fig:0 ] ) . here",
    "@xmath77 describes the chamber containing the critical point @xmath78 with @xmath79 .",
    "the prescribed gluing is given by the @xmath80-action on @xmath81 , and our smooth compact manifold has an expression , @xmath82 where @xmath83 denotes the dynkin diagram @xmath84 having a sign @xmath85 or @xmath86 on the edge , which specifies the @xmath80-action on the sign .",
    "this marked dynkin diagram is defined in definition 3.3 .",
    "if the action is trivial , @xmath87 ( the corresponding marked dynkin diagram is @xmath88 ) , then we have the tomei manifold ( [ tomei ] ) which is topologically equivalent to the connected sum of two torus .",
    "if the action is a standard one with @xmath89 with @xmath90 the cartan matrix for @xmath91 ( then @xmath92 ) , we obtain the compact manifold corresponding to the indefinite toda equation discussed in @xcite which is equivalent to the connected sum of two klein bottles .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :    in section 2 , we present the background information on the toda lattice on the variety of ad - diagonalizable jacobi elements with nonnegative signs .",
    "then the convex polytope of the weyl orbit associated with the toda lattice is introduced based on the convexity theorem due to bloch et al @xcite .",
    "we also present the cell decomposition consisting of the weyl chambers and their walls .    in section 3 , we define a twisted action of the weyl group on the set of signs @xmath93 .",
    "we also introduce a marked dynkin diagram where all the edges are assigned the signs which parametrizes a twisted sign action of the weyl group ( definition 3.3 ) .",
    "then we obtain the number of compatible twisted action of the weyl group ( proposition 3.1 ) .    in section 4",
    ", we construct a twisted tomei manifold associated with a marked dynkin diagram by defining gluing maps along both external and internal weyl chamber walls .",
    "the manifold is then shown to have the structure of a smooth and compact manifold with a weyl group action ( proposition 4.1 ) .",
    "a cell decomposition of the manifold is also obtained in terms of signed colored dynkin diagrams introduced in @xcite .",
    "then we conclude that the manifold is not orientable if the marked dynkin diagram has at least one negative sign on the edge ( proposition 4.3 ) , and the homology groups over @xmath94 of all the twisted tomei manifolds are the same as that of the original tomei manifold ( theorem 4.1 ) .    we then expect that the universal cover of the twisted tomei manifold @xmath95 is diffeomorphic to @xmath96 , hence @xmath95 is also aspherical .",
    "also we would like to mention that the homology group @xmath97 can be computed by the cell decomposition given in section 4.2 , but an explicit computation remains open . since the twisted tomei manifolds have a common morse function with different gluing ( attaching ) maps , the morse theory might be useful for a further study of the manifolds .",
    "in this paper , we use the following standard lie theoretic notation :    [ standard ] lie algebras :    let @xmath98 denote a real split semisimple lie algebra of rank @xmath99 with killing form @xmath100 , universal enveloping algebra @xmath101 and we let @xmath102 denote the dual of @xmath103 . fix a cartan decomposition @xmath104 with @xmath105 the lie algebra of a maximal compact lie group @xmath106 .",

    "we call the manifold the twisted tomei manifold , and here give a consruction of the manifold by gluing the chamber walls of the polytopes associated with different @xmath307 :    let @xmath83 denote a marked dynkin diagram giving rise to a fixed twisted sign action of @xmath115",
    ". recall _ external _ and _ internal _ chamber walls which constitute the boundary of @xmath71 and were described above .",
    "we then define gluing maps between the chamber walls denoted by @xmath308 as follows : for the internal walls , we define @xmath309 where note @xmath310 . for the external walls ,",
    "we define @xmath311 where @xmath312 .",
    "we denote @xmath313 the disjoint union of all the chambers with different signs , @xmath314 we also denote @xmath95 the topological space obtained from the disjoint union in ( [ disjoint ] ) by gluing along the internal and external walls using the maps @xmath315 and @xmath316 .",
    "there is then a map @xmath317          we must show that the action of @xmath115 sends pairs of elements that are identified with each other to other pairs of elements that are identified . consider first the case of the gluing maps for internal walls @xmath319 : let the vertical arrows in ( [ checkaction ] ) below correspond to multiplication by @xmath320 ; and assume the horizontal arrows are given by a gluing map of the form @xmath321 we have :      we thus obtain that the image of the first pair of points under the group action corresponds to another pair of points which are identified .",
    "the gluings along the external walls do not pose any difficulties either .",
    "we note that each @xmath62 is usually _ not _ preserved by the @xmath115 action .",
    "the union of the interiors of all the @xmath62 over @xmath327 can be identified with a copy of @xmath131 and the @xmath115 action would then correspond to the notion of a twisted @xmath115 action on a cartan subgroup .",
    "we can now express @xmath95 as a union :      0.5 cm similarly we consider @xmath329 denote by @xmath330 its image in @xmath95 .",
    "this set is compact and constitutes a fundamental domain of the @xmath115 action .",
    "moreover @xmath331 is a _",
    "box_. for example figure [ fig:1 ] shows the union of @xmath331 and @xmath332 in the @xmath91 case .",
    "the space @xmath95 has an action of @xmath115 as defined in ( [ extendedaction ] ) and verified in ( [ checkaction ] ) in lemma [ actionlemma ] .",
    "the compactness follows from the fact that @xmath115 is finite and that the box @xmath331 is compact because @xmath333 .",
    "the smoothness is obtained using the coordinate charts given by the boxes @xmath334 .",
    "since the unstable manifolds for the toda flow on @xmath71 have been described in ( [ unstable ] ) we are now able to describe the _ closures _",
    "@xmath338 of the unstable manifolds @xmath339 of the new toda flow in the twisted tomei manifold .",
    "recall the map @xmath340 in ( [ z ] ) .",
    "then we have @xmath341 since the closures of unstable manifolds are constructed in the same way as the twisted tomei manifolds with respect to a convex polytope associated to a parabolic subgroup of @xmath115 , we have :    for any @xmath198 , the closure of the unstable manifold @xmath342 is smooth .",
    "moreover @xmath342 is a twisted tomei manifold for the levi factor of a parabolic subgroup determined by @xmath343 with marked dynkin diagram @xmath344 ( see definition [ marked]).[smoothunstable ]      we now describe a cell decomposition that is useful in our explicit description of all the unstable manifolds of the toda lattice .",
    "this cell decomposition is not efficient in terms of computing homology because it contains too many cells ; however a more efficient cell decomposition is described in @xcite in the standard case .",
    "unfortunately the toda lattice is not a morse - smale vector field and consequently the boundary of an unstable manifold usually fails to be a combination of unstable manifolds .",
    "this problem is evident in lemma [ twos ] or in low dimensional examples ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "using the cell decomposition in subsection [ cellstomei ] we obtain a cell decomposition for @xmath95 by simply adding a factor @xmath345 and applying @xmath346 .",
    "note here that because of the gluings between external walls in ( [ glueout ] ) , the cells @xmath347 are not parametrized simply by the triples involving @xmath60 and @xmath348 .",
    "the value of @xmath349 for @xmath350 will be set to zero to avoid duplication of parameters .",
    "for any @xmath181 , we introduce          a _ signed colored _",
    "dynkin diagram is a triple @xmath354 , where @xmath355 with @xmath356 if @xmath350 ( otherwise @xmath357 ) and @xmath348 with @xmath358 .",
    "this corresponds to the notion of signed colored dynkin diagram in definition ( 5.1.2 ) in @xcite .",
    "there the simple roots in @xmath119 are colored _ blue _ if @xmath244 , _ red _ if @xmath245 ; and are given a sign @xmath359 if the simple root is in @xmath360 and a zero if the simple root belongs to @xmath361 .",
    "then the cell @xmath362 is parametrized by a signed colored dynkin diagram , @xmath363_{\\pi\\setminus s})\\ ] ] the faces of this cell",
    "are then expressed as @xmath364_{\\pi\\setminus s }   ) = ( \\epsilon;a\\cup \\left\\{\\alpha_j \\right\\};s ; [ w]_{\\pi\\setminus s }   ) } , \\quad    & \\text { if }   ( -1)^{c+1}=\\epsilon_j\\\\ & { } \\\\ & \\displaystyle { \\partial_{j , c } ( \\epsilon;a;s;[w]_{\\pi\\setminus s})= ( \\epsilon;a ; s \\cup",

    "we now define the chain complex @xmath365 , @xmath366 where the @xmath217-chain @xmath216 and the boundary map @xmath367 are defined as @xmath368_{\\pi\\setminus s})~:~    a , s\\subset \\pi , a\\cap s=\\emptyset ,   k=|\\pi\\setminus ( a\\cup s ) | , w\\in w ,   \\epsilon\\in { \\cal e } \\right ] , \\label{chaincomplex2}\\ ] ] @xmath369      with the gluing along the walls , one needs to get the cancellations of the orientations of the glued chambers .",
    "this then leads to a change of orientation at the boundary . in order to obtain cancellations along the internal walls of @xmath62",
    "we had introduced signs @xmath219 in ( [ gamma1 ] ) . recall ( also see figure [ fig:1 ] ) that external wall cancellations occur because @xmath223 differs on two sides of the wall , and internal wall cancellations are produced by the different signs @xmath222 .",
    "the exceptions to this are all the cases of non - trivial gluings that change the orientation ; these orientation changes can only happen along the internal @xmath176 walls satisfying @xmath245 ( _ negative walls _ ) . in these cases",
    "additional signs must be introduced to compensate orientation changes . for fixed @xmath209 and @xmath73",
    "we denote @xmath370 the @xmath249-th component of @xmath371 .",
    "the cell @xmath372 can then be represented in @xmath373 by          we illustrate the derivation of the expression in ( [ gamma2 ] ) in the case of @xmath375 .",
    "canonical examples are the original tomei manifold and the standard one ( @xmath83 is positively marked or @xmath83 is marked with signs determined by the cartan matrix as in definition [ marked ] ) . the change of orientation of the boundary of @xmath331 under the gluing @xmath315 in ( [ gluein ] ) , with @xmath376 is determined by the number of @xmath377 that change sign under the action of @xmath378 , that is by the sign of @xmath379 .",
    "this number is @xmath380 in the positively marked case and @xmath381 in the standard case . therefore , to have cancellations at the internal wall boundaries we have to insert a sign @xmath379 .",
    "if we now consider the @xmath382 wall of the new chamber @xmath383 , the new sign @xmath384 gets changed under the gluing map to @xmath385",
    ". thus the change of sign is given by the product @xmath386 .",
    "however there is already a sign attached to this chamber , namely @xmath387 and the product of these two gives the new sign which becomes @xmath388 with @xmath389 .",
    "this leads to the expression in ( [ gamma2 ] ) .",
    "we will now simply collect terms with the same @xmath407 but different sign @xmath408 .",
    "we then fix @xmath409 so that @xmath410 with different signs in the @xmath411-th component .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath412 becomes ( with @xmath413 by convention )      from ( [ two1 ] ) and since @xmath413 and @xmath415 , the only cases when a coefficient is zero are those for which : @xmath416 we thus obtain ( [ two3 ] ) for the coefficients @xmath396 . from here",
    "it follows that @xmath394 .",
    "assume that the marked dynkin diagram @xmath83 has some negative sign @xmath306 .",
    "by lemma [ twos ] it is enough to compute any of the coefficients in ( [ two3 ] ) and show that it is non - zero for the case of ( [ gamma2 ] ) , the unstable manifold for @xmath417 , the top cell . by picking a negatively marked edge as close as possible to one of the ends of the dynkin diagram we can reduce the calculation to the rank two cases .",
    "this is an easy calculation which we illustrate in example ( [ nonorientablea2 ] ) .",
    "we compute one of the coefficients in ( [ two3 ] ) .",
    "consider @xmath417 , @xmath418 , @xmath419 , @xmath420 , @xmath421 and @xmath422 . now for @xmath423 , we obtain @xmath424 and @xmath425 .",
    "thus the product of all these signs is one and we have a non - zero boundary of the top cell ( [ gamma2 ] ) .                in this case",
    "one observes that all the subdiagrams of standard marked dynkin diagram remain standard . hence these",
    "are not positively marked except in the case when there are no edges in the subdiagram and the corresponding weyl group @xmath196 is abelian .",
    "let @xmath426 be the number of all elements in @xmath115 with index @xmath217 .",
    "for example , @xmath426 is the eulerian number @xmath427 for @xmath103 of type @xmath52 ( i.e. @xmath428 , the symmetry group of order @xmath50 )",
