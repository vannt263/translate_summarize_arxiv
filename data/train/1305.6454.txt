    "we have shown how to group the stacking sequences in a stacking diagram that follows in a unique way from the bulk phase diagram .",
    "the binodals , their ending points , and their asymptotic behaviour are the three distinct elements that determine the boundaries between the different sedimentation states in the stacking diagram .",
    "the stacking and the bulk phase diagrams are linked by a well defined mathematical mapping based on the legendre transform .    in order to characterize the sedimentation states , a suitable order parameter is the array of thicknesses , @xmath88 , of the individual layers @xmath89 in a sedimented stack . when crossing a boundary in the sedimentation diagram , at least one of the @xmath90 , which implies a continuous phase transition in the inhomogeneous systems .",

    "the order of the individual stacks is always of decreasing total mass density , @xmath91 .",
    "the condition @xmath92 follows by imposing local thermodynamic stability along the sedimentation path , _",
    "i.e. _  that the matrix of partial derivatives @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the system volume , is positive definite @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the findings in @xcite , and not in conflict with the possibility of denser particles floating on top of lighter ones , as recently reported by piazza et al  @xcite , provided that the floating phase has lower mass density than the supporting phase .",
    "gravity induces very rich phenomenology even for the simplest of mixtures .",
    "for example , the binary hard core platelet mixture that we investigated has only isotropic and nematic phases stable in bulk .",
    "we found that the stacking diagram contains six different types of sequences , with up to four distinct layers .",
    "the maximum number of layers in a stacking sequence is not limited by the gibbs phase rule for bulk phases .",
    "instead , an extended gibbs phase rule holds , which accounts for the maximum number of layers that can appear in sedimentation - diffusion equilibrium .",
    "the relevant parameters are the number of binodals and the number of their inflection points , rather than only the number of components as is relevant in bulk . as a consequence",
    ", extremely rich stacking sequences can be found even for very simple mixtures .",
    "an example is the nini stack that we predict to occur in the binary platelet mixture .",
    "mixtures with three binodals can lead to stacking sequences with seven distinct layers in the simplest case with no inflection points .",
    "our results demonstrate that the ratio between the buoyant masses of both species , @xmath14 , is a key parameter that controls the stacking sequence of a mixture . changing the strength of gravity ,",
    "_ i.e. _  by using centrifugal forces as in analytic centrifugation , leaves the slope @xmath14 invariant .",
    "however , if the species are made of different materials , one can vary @xmath14 experimentally by changing the density of the solvent , because @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the particle volume , @xmath97 is the mass density of species  @xmath6 , and @xmath98 is the solvent density .",
    "alternatively , one could vary @xmath14 by designing colloids with cores made of different materials @xcite . while clearly the average density of colloids in the sample ( related to @xmath27 cf .",
    "( [ eqpath ] ) ) plays a major role in determining the stacking sequence , our considerations for the binary platelet mixture demonstrate that the total height of the sample is a further relevant parameter that should be carefully controlled in sedimentation experiments .",
    "our approach is relevant for computer simulation work , as the sedimentation - diffusion equilibrium of colloidal mixtures can be predicted by simulating only the bulk phase behaviour , which can be less computationally demanding than performing simulations of inhomogeneous systems under gravity .    although we have restricted our study to the case of binary mixtures ,",
    "the theory is valid for multicomponent systems , as sedimentation paths remain lines in the space spanned by all chemical potentials , cf .",
    "( [ eqlocalchemichalpotential ] ) .",
    "our theory can also be used to describe the sedimentation of mixtures with non - colloidal components .",
    "an example are mixtures of platelets and non - adsorbing polymers where the gravitational length of the polymers is much higher than that of the colloids .",
