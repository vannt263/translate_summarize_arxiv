    "because asymptotically ads spacetimes are not globally hyperbolic , the associated gravitational dynamics requires boundary conditions at the timelike conformal boundary @xmath1 ( e.g. the einstein static universe ( esu ) for global ads ) . at an operational level",
    "it is often convenient to impose boundary conditions at a fixed timelike cut - off surface @xmath2 at some finite location and then to eventually remove the cut - off .",
    "however , it also of interest to consider in its own right the _ ads dirichlet problem _ defined by a finite boundary @xmath2 . for convenience we take @xmath2 to be located at a fixed radial coordinate @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the ads boundary . in principle",
    "one could keep either the region @xmath5 ( which we call the ultraviolet ( uv ) side ) or the region @xmath6 ( which we call the infrared ( ir ) side ) , though we will consider only the ir side below . in our contexts ,",
    "the ir region will contain a smooth causal horizon as defined by observers on @xmath2 .",
    "there are several motivations for this study ranging from the purely mathematical @xcite , to various conceptual issues involving ads / cft ( see e.g. @xcite ) , an understanding of the wilsonian holographic renormalization group @xcite , and finding an ads / cft embedding of the black hole membrane paradigm as inspired by @xcite .",
    "the long - wavelength limit of this problem was analyzed in some detail in @xcite , while earlier works @xcite discussed the analogous situation for rindler spacetime .",
    "the structure of the resulting differential operators was addressed in @xcite",
    ". has vanishing extrinsic curvature .",
    "we thank toby wiseman for explaining the result to us . as with more familiar linearization instabilities ,",
    "we see no reason why this should call into question the self - consistency of the full non - linear problem . ] one might also be interested in more general boundary conditions on @xmath2 ( see e.g. @xcite ) , but we focus on the dirichlet problem below .    our present interest concerns an unusual feature found in @xcite .",
    "these works studied the long - wavelength hydrodynamic regime in the context of a flat boundary @xmath2 , either by computing linear quasi - normal modes @xcite or @xcite by following the construction of the fluid / gravity correspondence @xcite .",
    "to the boundary fluid dynamics ; this result will not play much of a role in our discussion . ]",
    "they found that when @xmath2 was sufficiently close to a killing horizon ( @xmath7 for some critical @xmath8 set by the temperature @xmath9 ) the effective speed of sound @xmath10 along @xmath2 exceeded the speed @xmath11 of null geodesics on @xmath2 ; i.e. , it became superluminal . when measured using some fixed metric ( associated with some fixed conformal frame ) on the ads boundary .",
    "the change in speed on @xmath2 comes primarily from transforming from fixed boundary coordinates to proper distance and time on @xmath2 . since the surface @xmath2 is infinitely redshifted in the limit where it approaches a horizon , the local sound speed on @xmath2 in this limit diverges .",
    "] in fact this result follows directly from thermodynamics as in this regime the pressure fluctuations exceed the energy density gradients ; i.e. , @xmath12 .",
    "it is also consistent with the analysis of @xcite who , inspired by the black hole membrane paradigm , relate the gravitational dynamics of rindler space with a cut - off to that of an incompressible navier - stokes fluid living on the cut - off surface ( for higher order generalisations see @xcite ) .",
    "here we recall that an incompressible fluid has an effectively infinite sound speed and is invariant under a galilean symmetry group .",
    "the natural concern is that transmission of information along the boundary at speed @xmath10 would violate bulk causality . to make this connection tight , recall that in the linear regime the relevant solutions are small perturbations of the ( planar ) @xmath13-dimensional solution @xmath14 or perhaps of rindler space , which is a limiting case . here",
    "@xmath15 denotes the line element on @xmath16-dimensional euclidean space , @xmath17 .",
    "causal curves satisfy @xmath18 , which for future - directed curves yields @xmath19 .",
    "but since @xmath20 increases monotonically , curves on the ir side of @xmath2 have @xmath21 .",
    "the fastest causal curve between two points on @xmath2 is thus a null geodesic on @xmath2 and any faster transmission of information would violate bulk causality .",
    ", though so long as the null convergence condition holds these shortcuts disappear in the limit where @xmath2 is taken to infinity @xcite . ]",
    "one thus wishes to ask whether the above superluminal speed hints at a serious problem for dirichlet boundary conditions . in pondering the issue ,",
    "it is natural to compare with the behavior of a tachyonic ( @xmath22 ) klein - gordon scalar in minkowski space for which the group velocity @xmath23 diverges at @xmath24 .",
    "here it is well - known that the dynamics is nevertheless causal in the sense that it transmits no information faster than the speed of light .",
    "however , we caution the reader that the tachyonic scalar is not good model for our ads dirichlet problem . for the tachyonic scalar the divergence in @xmath25",
    "is associated with an instability which manifests itself both at @xmath26 ( where it turns on ) and also at arbitrarily small @xmath27 ( where @xmath25 is imaginary ) .",
    "in contrast , the ads dirichlet problem has been shown to exhibit _ stable _ hydrodynamic behavior in the limit of small @xmath28 @xcite ; i.e. , @xmath25 is mostly real with a small negative imaginary part .",
    "in fact , we see no reason to expect instabilities any @xmath28 . while a full proof of stability is beyond the scope of this work , we will comment further on the issue in .",
    "in particular , our work below will show that the system is stable in the large @xmath28 limit and also provide numerical evidence for stability at intermediate @xmath28 .",
    "the following logical possibilities remain : 1 ) the system somehow succeeds in violating bulk causality , 2 ) the previous analyses are subject to some subtle inconsistency , or 3 ) the superluminal speed is merely an artifact of the gradient expansion . in the latter case , while the gradient expansion may still be useful for computing e.g. , correlators on @xmath2 in the limit of low wave number and frequency , it would approximate the effects of large - but - finite sources rather less well than in more familiar cases . in particular , despite the existence of a long - wavelength sound mode with @xmath29 ,",
    "no matter how large and slow are the transmitter and receiver , if separated by a distance @xmath30 the delay between emission and reception is always at least @xmath31 .",
    "this short note is an attempt discern which of the above possibilities are realized .",
    "were there no dirichlet wall , the well - known fact that the einstein equations are symmetric - hyperbolic would immediately exclude option 1 above . unless the effect were somehow due to a boundary graviton , it is difficult to see how this conclusion could be modified by the presence of a boundary .",
    "but we can probe both this possibilty and also option 2 above by analyzing the dispersion of linear perturbations at _ high _ frequencies .",
    "we expect the associated ultraviolet group velocity @xmath32 along @xmath2 to be closely related to the true maximum speed of information transmission in the same way that this limit gives geometric optics propagation along null geodesics for klein - gordon scalars with any ( positive or negative ) @xmath33 . in most cases",
    "we find that @xmath34 precisely matches the speed @xmath11 of null geodesics in @xmath2 , arguing against option 1 .",
    "the fact that the same equations lead to an infrared sound speed @xmath35 and @xmath36 sugests that the previous analyses are in fact consistent ( i.e. , that option 2 is not correct ) and supports the idea that the superluminal speed found in @xcite is an artifact of the gradient expansion ( option 3 ) .",
    "see e.g. , @xcite for a brief overview of ( and references to ) condensed matter systems with similar features .",
    "the problem of interest boils down to examining the quasinormal spectrum for spacetimes with a horizon and a rigid dirichlet cut - off surface .",
    "we will undertake this analysis both for the well - studied geometry and the rindler spacetime .",
    "the latter arises as a near - horizon geometry of the former and in this near - horizon limit one encounters a divergent sound propagation velocity at low frequencies .",
    "the rindler case is sufficiently special ( and sufficiently simple ) that we choose to treat it separately rather than carefully extracting the results from the more general analysis . in particular , as discussed in section [ s : discuss ] the rindler setting admits certain boundary gravitons for general boundary dimension @xmath37 while the case does so only for @xmath38 .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in",
    "we outline the general strategy for studying linear gravitational fluctuations both the and rindler backgrounds , reviewing some of the standard material discussed earlier in the literature .",
    "as is well known , the fluctuation equations can be decomposed based on the transformation properties of the graviton modes under spatial rotation symmetries .",
    "we will argue that the relevant channel for our studies is one where the graviton fluctuations transform as scalars under the spatial rotation group .",
    "we then undertake a detailed analysis of the scalar channel equation in ( for rindler space ) and ( for ) , arguing that the long - wavelength superluminal sound mode smoothly evolves with wavelength into a causal , linearly dispersing , high - frequency mode .",
    "the analysis involves a combination of analytical work both to extract the precise long - wavelength dispersion and the uv behavior of the dispersion ( using wkb techniques ) , as well as some numerical studies to understand the intermediate wavelength dispersions .",
    "we conclude in with a discussion of the implications of our result for the ads dirichlet problem and for the membrane paradigm .",
    "some technical results relevant for our analysis are collected in the appendices .",
    "the long - wavelength solution to the ads dirichlet problem considered in @xcite begins by considering fluctuations around the planar black hole ( [ sads ] ) , subject to dirichlet boundary conditions at a fixed cut - off surface @xmath2 taken to be located at @xmath39 .",
    "the focus there is on fluctuations which respect the dirichlet boundary condition whilst remaining long - wavelength _ vis a vis _ the hypersurface metric .",
    "we take the metric on @xmath2 to be a fixed minkowski metric on @xmath40 so as to discuss propagation of signals with respect to a fixed background light - cone ( thus @xmath41 henceforth ) . with the cut - off surface taken all the way to the boundary , @xmath42 ,",
    "the fluctuation equations for gravitational fields were first solved for in the seminal papers @xcite .",
    "we will examine a similar set - up , except that we are going to focus on the linearized problem and allow for fluctuations with arbitrary frequencies / momenta . in order to understand causality issues",
    ", it will also prove to be useful to examine the behaviour of fluctuations in the rindler geometry which arises as the near - horizon limit of the planar black hole .",
    "the gravitational fluctuations can be decomposed following @xcite into decoupled sectors based on the transformation properties under a spatial rotation group . in the radial gauge @xmath43 with @xmath44",
    "we use the spatial rotation symmetry @xmath45 transverse to @xmath46 to decompose the modes into modes into scalars , vectors and tensors .",
    "further , defining dimensionless frequency and momentum variables @xmath47 one finds the gauge invariant master fields in the three sectors to be @xcite : here as it exemplifies the generic case . ]",

    "in particular we require @xmath58    these equations simplify dramatically in the naive limit of large @xmath59 and @xmath60 limit with @xmath61 . keeping only the formally leading terms in @xmath59 ,",
    "all three sectors give rise to an universal equation @xmath62 this is obvious for the tensor and vector channels ; for the scalar channel it follows from the fact that @xmath63 thus simplifying the last term in the equation .",
    "the universal nature of this limit reflects the fact that for @xmath64 thermal correlation functions in the dual cft agree at high frequency with those of the cft vacuum , and thus are controlled by conformal invariance . since all channels correspond to operators of dimension @xmath65 , they behave identically in this limit .    applying a simple wkb argument to ( [ sadsuniv ] )",
    "immediately gives @xmath66 on @xmath2 , which is just the condition for propagation along the light cones of @xmath2 .",
    "to begin , note that wkb solutions to ( [ sadsuniv ] ) are oscillatory near the horizon ( where @xmath67 ) .",
    "quasinormal modes require ingoing boundary conditions , so the magnitude @xmath68 of the solution remains essentially constant until the wkb approximation breaks down at some @xmath69 where @xmath66 .",
    "the boundary condition @xmath70 thus requires @xmath71 .",
    "but the case @xmath72 may also be excluded since for @xmath73 the wkb solution is a linear combination of rapidly growing and decaying real exponentials .",
    "matching to the oscillatory solution requires the two branches to be of the same order in @xmath74 at @xmath75 . as a result ,",
    "the solution @xmath76 is exponentially large in @xmath74 at @xmath77 and can not satisfy our dirichlet boundary condition .",
    "we thus tentatively conclude @xmath78 , and thus @xmath79 as desired .",
    "most of the rest of this work is devoted to showing consistency with the rindler limit , setting up a framework in which one could compute sub - leading corrections , making the analysis of ( [ sadsuniv ] ) more rigorous , and especially to showing that including the effects of poles in the naively sub - leading terms in ( [ sadsseq ] ) and ( [ sadsveq ] ) does not significantly change the result .",
    "another spacetime of interest for us will be the rindler geometry whose metric we take to be given by @xmath80 in @xmath81 dimensions , where @xmath82 is an arbitrary constant with dimensions of length .",
    "the above can be shown to be the near horizon limit of the planar black hole ( see ) .",
    "we might specialize if necessary to @xmath83 but for the moment we can keep @xmath37 arbitrary .",
    "the gravitational fluctuation equations are easy to obtain and the master fields follow from the results of @xcite ( see ) .",
    "we take the cutoff surface @xmath2 in our rindler space - time to be @xmath84 , noting that the scale invariance of rindler space makes all choices of @xmath82 are equivalent .",
    "there is thus no loss of generality in setting the cut - off to be given by the scale @xmath82 which secretly is the scale before taking the near - horizon limit .",
    "below , we denote the frequencies and momenta conjugate to @xmath85 and @xmath86 as @xmath87 and @xmath88 respectively .    for the fluctuations , we continue to work in the radial gauge @xmath89 with @xmath90 we use the spatial rotation symmetry @xmath45 transverse to @xmath91 to decompose the modes into modes into scalars , vectors and tensors . note",
    "that regularity ( an ingoing boundary condition ) on the future horizon requires @xmath92 the simplest channel to study is the tensor channel , where for modes with polarization in the spatial directions transverse to the momentum , one encounters a minimally coupled klein - gordon equation : @xmath93 \\ , z_t(\\varrho ) = 0 .",

    "we begin with the rindler geometry which as one might anticipate is amenable to exact analytic treatment ( at least for the tensor and scalar channels ) .",

    "this acausality would be benign in the sense that , so long as the boundary conditions are invariant under diffeomorphisms , this symmetry will prevent the boundary gravitons from interacting with other degrees of freedom .",
    "but by considering more general ( but still local ) boundary conditions one would be able to construct systems in which essentially any source transmits information outside the light cones defined by the metric .",
    "it turns out that truly superluminal boundary gravitons appear in the dirichlet problem outside a btz black hole .",
    "taking @xmath229 to be proper distance in the radial direction we may write the metric in the form @xmath230 where we have considered the non - spinning case @xmath231 . by acting with an appropriate boost in the @xmath232-direction . ]",
