    "the search for superheavy elements ( she ) has made exciting progress in the last few years @xcite .",
    "new , often more neutron - rich , isotopes of elements @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have been reported as well as the synthesis of the new elements @xcite and @xcite . at the same time",
    "earlier experiments were confirmed and more data for already existing isotopes collected @xcite .",
    "together with the @xmath0-decay products of the newly synthesized nuclei the known region of superheavy elements has grown substantially .",
    "she are by definition those nuclei at the upper end of the chart of nuclei where quantum - mechanical shell effects reverse the trend of decreasing  and , for the heavier ones , practically vanishing  liquid - drop fission barriers to produce significant stabilization .",
    "the lifetimes of the recently found she are many orders of magnitude smaller than the early optimistic estimates @xcite .",
    "additionally the systematics of fusion cross sections suggests that the extension of the chart of nuclides might be limited by the production mechanism of she , not their decay @xcite . with recent experiments heading for unknown territory",
    ", theory has to provide reliable predictions for the stability and the most accessible regions in the landscape of nuclides .",
    "a crucial feature is here spontaneous fission which is characterized by the fission barrier .",
    "not too much is known experimentally on the fission barriers of transfermium nuclei .",
    "although their height is not known , barriers for @xmath1no and @xmath2no are high enough to stabilize these isotopes against fission up to angular momentum 20 @xcite .",
    "an analysis of all available data for fusion and fission of @xmath3112 , @xmath3114 and @xmath4116 was given recently in ref .",
    "surprisingly the barrier heights deduced for these very heavy nuclei are similar , or even slightly larger , than the ones of actinide nuclei in the @xmath5pu region .",
    "for some other superheavy nuclei it is known that the barrier is relatively small from the simple fact that fission is their preferred decay channel .",
    "this leads to another aspect of the stability against fission : the experimental identification of new superheavy nuclides is much simpler when @xmath0 decay is the dominating decay channel .",
    "all recent new decay chains from dubna end in a region of fissioning nuclei which prevents an extension of the known region of she to the `` southeast '' with current experimental techniques .",
    "the calculation of fission half - lives is a very demanding task , which became clear quite early @xcite .",
    "first explorations of the potential energy surfaces of transfermium nuclei demonstrated already that triaxial and reflection - asymmetric degrees of freedom often greatly reduce the fission barrier .",
    "the collective mass provides the metric for the dynamical calculation of the fission half - lives .",
    "there is no published work so far that considers all ingredients using self - consistent models .",
    "first ambitious steps in that direction were taken for the calculation of the decay of the fission isomer into the ground state @xcite .",
    "the published fission half - lives from macroscopic - microscopic mean - field models also simplify the task considerably by restricting shape - degrees of freedom to axially symmetric ones and using a phenomenological parameterization of inertia parameters .",
    "the detailed potential energy landscape is also an ingredient for estimates on the fusion cross section , although somewhat different paths have to be considered asymptotically , see e.g.   refs .",
    "@xcite and further references therein .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to analyze the extrapolation of self - consistent mean - field models , namely the skyrme - hartree - fock ( shf ) approach and the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) model , concerning large - amplitude deformation properties of she . to that end",
    ", we present a systematic survey of fission paths and barriers for a broad range of she , scanning the @xmath0-decay chains of even - even nuclei that are accessible with the current experimental techniques . the nuclei considered in this study cover the proton numbers and the corresponding neutron numbers .",
    "we first benchmark our models by calculating axial fission barriers and isomeric states for heavy actinide nuclei for which experimental data are available , namely isotopes with proton numbers ranging from to 98 .    section [ sect : early ] summarizes the most important results of earlier studies relevant for our calculations .",

    "finally , section [ sec : search ] attempts to identify the underlying reasons for the different predictions among the forces and models .",
    "estimates of the stability of she against fission have a long history .",
    "first explorations of the potential landscapes were made with phenomenological corrections for shell effects @xcite , even before strutinsky introduced the microscopic - macroscopic method @xcite , which was then immediately applied to large - scale calculations of fission barriers of heavy and superheavy nuclei , see e.g.  ref .  @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "the deformation energy is minimized in a limited space of shape parameters .",
    "it soon became clear that reflection - asymmetric @xcite and triaxial @xcite shape degrees of freedom have to be included . complementing the collective potential energy surfaces by mass parameters enabled the calculation of fission half - lives of heavy and superheavy nuclei , with phenomenological mass parameters @xcite as well as with microscopically computed cranking masses @xcite .",
    "studies along that line are continued until today with improved parameterizations of the mic - mac model , either the finite - range droplet ( frdm ) plus folded - yukawa single - particle potential model and phenomenological masses @xcite or the yukawa - plus - exponential ( ype ) macroscopic plus a woods - saxon microscopic model and cranking masses @xcite . nearly all large - scale calculations of fission lifetimes , however , consider axially symmetric shapes only ( as we will do ) .",
    "a recent exception is presented in ref.@xcite where triaxial shapes are taken into account , however , at the price of a reduced number of shape degrees of freedom in other places .    there",
    "do exist also systematic calculations of fission barriers where the macroscopic part of the energy is calculated within the semi - classical thomas - fermi approximation @xcite .",
    "one step further toward self - consistency is the extended thomas - fermi strutinsky - integral ( etfsi ) approach where the same microscopic skyrme force is used to calculate the macroscopic part of the binding energy and to determine the single - particle spectra for the calculation of the shell correction . for a large - scale survey of the axially and reflection - symmetric potential energy surfaces of heavy and superheavy nuclei in the etfsi approach using the skyrme interaction sksc4 see refs .",
    "results allowing also for triaxial degrees of freedom are presented for selected nuclei in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to determine the fission path in microscopic - macroscopic , thomas - fermi , and etfsi calculations ,",
    "the total energy is minimized with respect to parameters of the nuclear shape .",
    "there are numerous parameterizations to be found in the literature , which differ by emphasizing either high - order multipoles at small deformation , or the fragment deformation of two - center - type configurations at large deformations , see ref.@xcite for an overview . while the latter are important for the proper description of the saddle - point of actinide nuclei ( which is located at very large @xmath6 ) ,",
    "the first might be better suited for superheavy nuclei where the saddle point is located at rather small @xmath6 .",
    "the number of shape degrees of freedom in actual calculations does rarely exceed five , in most cases it is even smaller .",
    "this restriction does not exist in the framework of self - consistent models . besides very general spatial symmetries that are imposed ( e.g.  axiality , reflection symmetry , or triaxiality )",
    "there are no further assumptions made on the nuclear density distribution .",
    "as this makes self - consistent calculations more costly in terms of computational time , there is much less published work employing self - consistent models so far .    a systematic study of the deformation energy of superheavy nuclei along the valley of @xmath7 stability in the region and in hfb calculations with the gogny force d1s under restriction to axially and reflection symmetric shapes was presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "potential energy surfaces of selected heavier nuclei are presented in ref .",
    "the full potential energy surface in the @xmath7@xmath8 plane of a few selected nuclei as resulting from shf calculations in a triaxial representation is presented in ref .",
    "this investigation points out the importance of triaxial shapes at small deformations .",
    "the fission barrier of some superheavy nuclei is reduced to half its value when relaxing the constraint on axial symmetry and going through triaxial paths .",
    "the fission path returns to axially symmetric shapes at larger deformations .",
    "but here it is necessary to allow for reflection asymmetric shapes to accommodate the usually asymmetric fission .",
    "a first exploration of asymmetric shapes of she within self - consistent shf and rmf models was presented in ref .  @xcite . for many superheavy systems , reflection - asymmetric shapes",
    "lower the fission path at large prolate deformation , and remove in most cases the outer barrier known from actinide nuclei ( and persisting for superheavy nuclei when considering reflection - symmetric shapes only ) .",
    "we explore the potential landscapes using two widely used self - consistent mean - field models , namely the non - relativistic skyrme - hartree - fock ( shf ) method as well as the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) approach @xcite .",
    "there exists a great variety of parameterizations for both models which often differ when extrapolated .",
    "it is long known that different parameterizations of a self - consistent model are not equivalent for the calculation of fission barriers of actinide nuclei , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a comparison of early skyrme forces and @xcite for a comparison of rmf forces .",
    "comparisons between shf and rmf hint at genuine model differences @xcite .",
    "relevant for our study is also that there exist conflicting predictions for the location of the spherical magic numbers in she , see ref .",
    "@xcite , which can be expected to be reflected in the structure of the potential landscapes .    a fair survey of the extrapolation of the models to large mass number and large deformation has therefore to cover a selection of typical parameterizations .",
    "we have chosen parameterizations which give a very satisfactory description of stable nuclei but differ in details .",
    "namely we use the skyrme interactions skp @xcite , sly6 @xcite , ski3 , and ski4 @xcite . in the relativistic calculations the",
    "parameterizations nl3 @xcite and nl - z2 @xcite of the standard lagrangian are employed .",
    "the parameterization skp has the isoscalar effective mass and was originally designed to describe the particle - hole and particle - particle channel of the effective interaction simultaneously ( we do not make use of this particular feature ) .",
    "the forces sly6 , ski3 , and ski4 stem from recent fits including already data on exotic nuclei ( all three forces ) and even neutron matter ( sly6 ) . both skp and sly6",
    "use the standard spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the forces ski3/4 employ a spin - orbit force with modified isovector dependence .",
    "ski3 contains a fixed isovector part analogous to the non - relativistic limit of the rmf , whereas ski4 is adjusted allowing free variation of the isovector spin - orbit term . the rmf force nl - z2 is fitted in the same way as ski3 and ski4 to a similar set of observables .",
    "lcccccc force & skp & ski3 & ski4 & sly6 & nl - z2 & nl3 + @xmath9 ( mev ) & 202 & 258 & 248 & 230 & 172 & 270 + @xmath10 & 1.00 & 0.59 & 0.65 & 0.69 & 0.64 & 0.67 + @xmath11 ( mev ) & 30.0 & 34.8 & 29.5 & 32.0 & 39.0 & 37.4 + @xmath12 ( mev ) & 18.2 & 18.3 & 18.3 & 17.7 & 17.7 & 18.5 +    a quantity that characterize the average deformation properties of an effective interaction is the surface energy coefficient .",
    "it is determined for the model system of semi - infinite nuclear matter , which offers the cleanest procedure to define a surface energy , see , e.g.  @xcite and the references given therein . in table [ tab : asurf ] , we give values for bulk and surface properties of nuclear matter obtained exclusively in fully self - consistent hartree - fock calculations of semi - infinite matter @xcite . often values obtained within the extended thomas - fermi approximation are given @xcite , which are usually smaller by about 1 mev .",
    "a correction of the binding energy for spurious center - of - mass motion is performed as usual . for ski3 , ski4 , sly6 , and nl - z2 the c.m .",
    "correction is subtracted after variation . for skp the diagonal part of @xmath13 only is considered before variation , while for nl3 the harmonic - oscillator estimate for @xmath13 is subtracted , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "the c.m .",
    "correction , however , varies only little with deformation , see e.g.  ref.@xcite .",
    "note that the various recipes for c.m.correction can not be easily interchanged as their differences are partially absorbed into the force parameters .",
    "this has a consequence relevant for our study : the difference between the `` exact '' and the approximate schemes used for skp and nl3 scales in leading order as @xmath14 . during the fit",
    "this difference is incorporated into the effective interaction which leads to the significantly larger surface tension for skp and nl3 found in table [ tab : asurf ] , see ref.@xcite .",
    "the deformation energy from otherwise equally fitted forces might differ on the order of 5 mev at the outer barrier in actinides . for she , where the saddle - point is at smaller deformation , this effect can be expected to be less pronounced , but still might cause differences of a few mev between forces .",
    "we treat pairing correlations within the bcs approximation using an effective density - independent zero - range delta pairing force with the strength adjusted for each mean - field parameterization separately as described in ref .",
    "including a density dependence of the effective pairing interaction or an approximate particle - number projection might alter the barrier heights on the order of 1 mev for actinide nuclei @xcite .",
    "the coupled mean - field equations for both shf and rmf models are represented on a grid in coordinate space using a fourier representation of the derivatives and are solved with the damped gradient iteration method as described in ref .",
    "the numerical codes for both models @xcite share the same basic numerical routines which allows for a direct comparison of the results .",
    "note that the accuracy of grid techniques is fairly independent on deformation , which is an advantage to calculations using an harmonic oscillator basis expansion , see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite for a convergence study for @xmath15fm .",
    "finally , beyond - mean - field effects can modify the fission barrier .",
    "the most important corrections to the binding energy remove the contributions from spurious collective vibrational and rotational states which are inevitably admixed to the mean - field wave functions @xcite .",
    "these corrections lower the barriers , typically up to 1 mev for the inner one and up to 2 mev for the outer when starting from a well - deformed prolate ground state .",
    "the situation is less clear for transitional or spherical nuclei .",
    "altogether , the present study has uncertainties on the deformation energy for given configuration of the order 1 - 2 mev .",
    "most of the possible improvements increase the binding energy .",
    "thus we can assume to explore an upper limit for the barriers .",
    "the comparison of barriers between different forces is more robust because most corrections can be expected to be similar for all forces .",
    "we will consider reflection - symmetric as well as reflection - asymmetric fission paths .",
    "but we restrict the considerations to axially symmetric shapes .",
    "our investigation also covers the prolate fission path only .",
    "it has to be kept in mind that novel fission paths may emerge for the heaviest of the nuclides discussed here , which start out from strongly oblate shapes and proceed through triaxial deformations @xcite . for this and the reasons given above our results provide an upper limit for the ( static ) fission barriers .",
    "this limitation holds also for most other work using self - consistent models published so far , as well as most of the results from mic - mac approaches .",
    "the deformation energy curves are obtained with a constraint on the mass quadrupole moment @xmath16 . for reflection - asymmetric shapes",
    ", we also fix the center - of - mass with a constraint on the mass dipole moment .",
    "the constraints are added to the energy functional by means of lagrange multipliers @xcite . besides these constraints , the deformation energy is minimized with respect to all axial multipole moments @xmath17 for protons and neutrons separately . in a self - consistent calculation ,",
    "the energy is not only minimized with respect to the deformation , but also the radial profile of the density distribution , again separately for protons and neutrons . with that",
    ", a self - consistent calculation explores many more degrees of freedom than the best microscopic - macroscopic calculation available so far .",
    "some consequences will be discussed in section [ subsect : saddlepoint ] below .",
    "the deformation energy is shown versus the dimensionless multipole deformations of the mass density which are defined as @xmath18 note that the @xmath19 are computed from the expectation values of the actual shapes and need to be distinguished from the generating moments which are used in multipole expansions of the nuclear shape in microscopic - macroscopic models @xcite .",
    "the constrained calculation does not always follow exactly the static fission path , which is defined as the path that follows the steepest descent in the multidimensional energy surface .",
    "instead , for each value of @xmath20 , one obtains a state which corresponds to a minimum with respect to all other degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "this might cause some problems to keep track of the path whenever the fission path has a small component only in the direction of the constraint .",
    "often there exist two or even more distinct valleys in the multidimensional potential landscape which are separated by potential barriers . depending on the choice for the initial wave functions ,",
    "the constrained calculation might find the nearest relative minimum only , which is not necessarily the absolute minimum for a given constraint .",
    "the existence of distinct valleys complicates the interpretation of the deformation energy curves .",
    "when the solution jumps from one valley to another it misses the saddle point in between .",
    "the resulting uncertainty is not clear _ a priori _ , as only a calculation including two or even more constraints can clarify if there is a flat plateau or a mountain ridge between the two valleys . the change from one to another valley in the potential landscape is accompanied by discontinuities in higher multipole deformations which can be used to identify them . in some cases the existence of two distinct valleys might be the artifact of imposed symmetries , c.f .",
    "the case of @xmath21fm , where the two distinct valleys obtained from axially symmetric calculations are spurious as the two solutions are smoothly connected through triaxial shapes @xcite .",
    "actinides are the heaviest nuclear systems for which data on the structure of the fission barrier are available .",
    "we use these nuclei to benchmark our models and forces , and to examine the force dependence of the predictions .",
    "we confine our investigation to axial barriers but release reflection symmetry in the calculations of the outer barriers and isomeric states .",
    "there exists a wealth of information about the ( in most cases ) double - humped fission barriers of actinide nuclei , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references given therein .",

    "the deformation energy of 15.9 mev of the ground state corresponds to 0.9 @xmath26 of the total binding energy .",
    "the inner barrier explores triaxial degrees of freedom , which reduce the ( axial ) barrier by about 3 mev .",

    "@xcite for results obtained using skyrme interactions , @xcite using gogny forces and refs .",
    "@xcite for the rmf , see also @xcite .",
    "early comparisons of barriers obtained with different skyrme forces using approximations to full self - consistency were published in refs .",
    ". a direct comparison of the potential energy curves with triaxial inner and reflection - asymmetric outer barriers obtained with the skyrme interactions sly6 , skm * and ski4 , the gogny force d1s and the rmf forces nl3 and nl - z2 is presented in @xcite .",
    "the excitation energy of the fission isomer has been studied with a variety of skyrme forces in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the influence of correlations on the deformation energy in the framework of skyrme mean - field calculations has been studied in ref .",
    "an exact angular momentum projection lowers the axial inner barrier by a bit less than 1 mev , the excitation energy of the isomeric minimum by about 1 mev , and the reflection - symmetric outer barrier by about 1.5 - 2 mev .",
    "removing spurious quadrupole vibrations from the mean - field states by configuration mixing of the angular - momentum projected mean field states lowers both the ground state and the isomeric state by a few 100 kev . for @xmath5pu",
    ", this effect is more pronounced for the isomer , which lowers its excitation energy even further , but it can not be expected that this will be the same for all actinides .    in this section",
    "we will confine ourselves to the heights of the inner and outer barrier as well as the excitation energies of the isomeric states while postponing a thorough discussion of the potential landscapes to future work . as our goal is the extrapolation of the models to superheavy nuclei",

    "we omit fm isotopes as there are two competing paths at the outer barrier , and there is no continuous axial path for the inner barrier for some skyrme forces @xcite .",
    "figure [ 1stbar ] compares calculated and experimental heights of the inner barrier . in the case of the inner barrier ,",
    "the comparison of data with values obtained from axial calculations is somewhat dangerous , as the static inner barrier is known to be triaxial and the energy gain through triaxial deformation may differ for each force .",
    "still , there are several conclusions that can be safely drawn from fig .",
    "[ 1stbar ] .",
    "our selection of forces suggests that there is a difference between shf and rmf models .",
    "all skyrme forces predict that the inner barrier increases with neutron number up to , most pronounced for sly6 .",
    "the @xmath47 dependence of the barrier height is most pronounced for ski3 and ski4 , the skyrme forces with an extended spin - orbit interaction , while it is negligible for skp , the only force in our sample with the large effective mass , c.f .",
    "table [ tab : asurf ] .",
    "one might suspect that the corresponding large level density suppresses shell effects compared to the other forces . on the other hand , for the two rmf forces",
    "the barriers stay nearly constant with @xmath48 , and show an increase with @xmath47 only .",
    "this finding suggests a significant difference in shell structure between the shf and rmf models .",
    "experimental data do not show any significant dependence on @xmath48 or @xmath47 at all , they just fall off a few 100 kev with mass number . from our present calculations , it can not be decided if adding triaxiality will give a similar trend .",
    "there is also a difference in absolute height between shf and rmf . with the exception of skp , the inner barriers from shf are significantly higher by about 2 mev than those obtained within the rmf",
    "this is reflected in the values for the mean deviation of the inner barrier height @xmath49 from the experimental value in mev is 4.5 ( sly6 ) , 2.7 ( skp ) , 4.1 ( ski3 ) , 4.1 ( ski4 ) , 1.5 ( nl - z2 ) , and 2.3 ( nl3 ) respectively , although this quantity is of limited significance .",
    "angular momentum projection will lower the barrier by about 1 mev , and one can speculate only about the effect of triaxiality and other correlations on the trends with @xmath48 and @xmath47 .",
    "it is tempting to assume that , when including these missing corrections , the shf might still overestimate the barriers of the heavier nuclei but be on the right order for the lighter ones , while the rmf will underestimate the barriers of th isotopes already on the mean - field level .",
    "the outer barrier heights as predicted by the various mean - field forces are shown in fig .",
    "[ 2ndbar ] . for the outer barrier",
    ", it can be expected that our calculations cover all necessary degrees of freedom , so data and calculated values can be directly compared .",
    "there are differences in absolute barrier height . with a mean deviation of the outer barrier height in mev of 2.2 ( sly6 ) , 4.7 ( skp ) , 1.4 ( ski3 ) , 3.8 ( ski4 ) , 1.2 ( nl - z2 ) , and 0.8 ( nl3 ) respectively , ski3 , nl - z2 and",
    "in particular nl3 give a quite good description of the barrier height on the mean - field level .",
    "the differences found for the barrier height seem to manifest themselves mainly in an overall offset , while all models and forces predict quite similar trends of the barrier heights with @xmath48 and @xmath47 , a bit more pronounced for skyrme forces , and a bit more damped for nl - z2 .",
    "the good news is that this overall trend is quite close to the experimental findings .    as barriers from nl - z2 are already always smaller than the experimental values , there is no room left for correlation effects . for shapes around the outer barrier",
    ", the ( missing ) rotational correction can be expected to be about 1.5 mev larger than for the ground state of a well - deformed nucleus .",
    "when removing those 1.5 mev from the outer barrier heights shown in fig .  [ 2ndbar ] , the barriers from the rmf are too low , in particular for nl - z2 , where not much will be left .",
    "the excitation energy of the fission isomer is displayed in fig .",
    "[ act : isomer ] .",
    "we have added also results obtained for the nuclei with neutron numbers between those used to investigate the barriers above . to the best of our knowledge , only three experimental values for superdeformed @xmath50 states in even - even nuclei",
    "are available so far from spectroscopy in the superdeformed and normal - deformed wells , which are @xmath51u and @xmath5pu , see the recent collection of data in @xcite .",
    "there are more superdeformed levels known in some other adjacent even and odd nuclei , but their quantum numbers could not be established so far .",
    "they all have in common that their excitation energy is at least 2 mev , which also sets some constraints to our calculations .",
    "these values are also consistent with the data obtained from fits to fission - isomer excitation functions , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "although the sparse data do not allow for a detailed analysis , there are a few conclusions that can be drawn . on the mean - field level",
    ", skp gives rather high energies and overestimates the data by about 2 mev .",
    "values from sly6 are scattered around the data .",
    "rmf models predict very low excitation energies .",
    "the skyrme interactions ski3 and ski4 with extended spin - orbit interactions also underestimate the known excitation energies at least for certain elements .",
    "it is noteworthy that ski3 , nl3 and particularly nl - z2 predict the superdeformed state to be the ground state for some actinide nuclei , in contradiction with experimental knowledge about the spectroscopy and decay of those nuclei .",
    "it was already noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite for selected examples that the rmf underestimates the excitation energy of the fission isomer .",
    "this seems to be a general shortcoming of the rmf model , at least of most , if not all , of its standard parameterizations .",
    "this finding is not restricted to actinide nuclei , but was also observed for superdeformed states in the neutron - deficient region @xcite , where it can be cured to some extend taking additional information about the spherical shell structure of @xmath52pb into account during the fit of the force parameters @xcite .",
    "the overbinding of the fission isomer can be expected to become even more pronounced when corrections for breaking of rotational and other symmetries are considered .    from our small selection of skyrme forces ,",
    "it is hard to disentangle the influence of the effective mass and of the various spin - orbit functionals from the influence of the actual fitting procedure on the predictions for barrier heights .",
    "it is tempting to correlate the large deformation energy obtained with skp with its large effective mass , but this is ruled out by recent skyrme - hfb mass fits with effective mass around 1.0 that deliver much smaller barriers @xcite than skp . since nl - z2 and nl3 have the same functional form , the tendency of nl3 to larger barriers must result from the different strategies to adjust the force .",
    "it is a bit surprising that the differences in surface tension visible in table [ tab : asurf ] are not reflected in the inner barrier heights and can not be solely responsible for the differences obtained for outer barrier heights and fission isomers .",
    "shell effects seem to play a much larger role for these quantities than the nuclear matter properties . for the forces in our sample ,",
    "the difference in surface tension seems to be compensated by other features of the forces through the fit .",
    "however , when the influence of shell effects is suppressed by comparing predictions of pairs of otherwise identically fitted forces with different surface tension , one finds indeed the expected difference , see ref .",
    "@xcite for the example of the skyrme interactions sly4 and sly6 and the rmf forces nl1 and nl - z .    summarizing , a differences in the models , can be recognized : shf gives usually higher barriers than rmf . in comparison with experimental data",
    ", it seems that the rmf predictions are too low for barriers and fission isomers .",
    "these findings were already hinted in earlier investigations of actinide @xcite and superheavy nuclei @xcite , but emerge even more clearly for the present systematic investigation of nuclei .    in the next section",

    "comparing the potential energy curves from nl - z2 and sly6 at small deformation for the heaviest nuclei , one sees also some differences concerning how strongly the nuclei are driven to sphericity . comparing nuclides in the `` northeastern '' corner of figure [ fig : all - sly6-nlz2 ] ,",

    "this seems to be a general feature of all self - consistent models @xcite , and can also be observed in mic - mac models , which predict deformed isotopes @xcite far off .",
    "this is due partially to the overall larger shell correction energy of the spherical neutron shells compared to the proton shells @xcite , and partially to the existence of many deformed proton shell closures in the region , which drive nuclei with non - magic neutron number toward deformation .",

    "usually does not show a fission isomer , this can not be a general feature of the rmf model , but has to be a particularity of the nl3 parameterization .",
    "similarly , ski4 is an exception among the skyrme interactions .",
    "most nuclear matter properties of nl3 and nl - z2 are very close , the same holds for the skyrme interactions ski4",
    ", ski3 and sly6 .",
    "this suggests that the height of the outer barrier is mainly determined by shell structure , not the average liquid drop properties .",
    "remember that ski4 employs a non - standard spin - orbit interaction which leads to single - particle spectra different from those of the other self - consistent models at spherical shape @xcite .",
    "a most interesting feature of she is the stability against spontaneous fission .",

    "we aim here at a mere comparison of stability between the different forces . to that end , we assume that the collective masses are about similar in all cases and confine the discussion to the height of the ( inner ) axial fission barrier as key quantity",

    "the systematics of the fission barriers for all nuclei and mean - field forces considered here are shown in figure [ barriers ] .",

    "all models and forces agree that there is a regime of low fission barriers around , but the ( axial ) barriers increase again when going toward .",
    "there are , however , significant differences among the models . comparing the fully self - consistent models ,",
    "the barriers from rmf are much lower than those from shf .    and",
    "even among the various shf forces , we see differences in the barriers .",
    "it is again ski4 with its particular spin - orbit force which shows the largest barriers .",
    "here it is noteworthy that ski4 predicts largest stability for although it places the magic shell closure at @xcite .",
    "this shows once again that `` magicity '' is something different from stability as was argued also in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the etfsi calculations give barriers that have about the size as the ones from the rmf forces , with the difference that they produce a bit smaller barriers at the lower end and larger regions with more stable nuclei .",
    "similarly , the barriers from the mic - mac rather correspond to the estimates from the rmf forces .",

    "a maximum of stability is found around and less stability for larger systems .",
    "effective mass can not be the reason because skp with @xmath68 behaves as all other shf and rmf .",

    "it is well - known that multipole moments at least up to @xmath69 have to be taken into account to obtain the full shell effect around @xmath70hs@xmath71 @xcite .",
    "it can be expected that even more shape degrees of freedom are necessary to get the full shell effect for the even more complex saddle - point configuration .",
    "the standard mic - mac models also assume that protons and neutrons have the same deformation .",
    "an exploration of the consequences of this constraint in the framework of the self - consistent gogny force is given in ref .",
    "@xcite . imposing",
    "the same deformation for neutrons and protons leads to larger barriers of the order of 1 mev in actinides .",
    "a similar effect can be expected for she .",
    "even more severe might be the parameterization of the radial density distribution in mic - mac models .",
    "there is no radial degree of freedom at all , although it is well - known that changing the surface diffuseness might significantly change the ground - state shell correction of she .",

    "if the differences seen in fig .  [ barriers-4forces ] are rooted in the macroscopic part , another bulk property than @xmath12 has to be responsible .",

    "additionally , the radial shape of the density distribution might change with nucleon numbers @xcite or deformation .",
    "figure [ levels_182_120 ] provides an example for the latter : at small deformation nl - z2 predicts a semi - bubble shape for @xmath82 ( see the small inserts in the upper panel ) , which around changes abruptly into a more regular density distribution , thereby causing the discontinuity in the single - particle spectra at that deformation .",

    "this does not yet lead to a significantly smaller ( total ) shell correction for nl - z2 ( mev ) than for sly6 ( mev ) @xcite , but their splitting with deformation brings more of these levels close to the fermi energy around the fission barrier for nl - z2 , which might be the reason for the difference between nl - z2 and sly6 . from looking at the single - particle spectra in figure [ levels_182_120 ] alone , however , this can not be decided . to resolve this issue , a calculation of the shell correction for deformed shapes along the strategy of ref .",

    "for example , the subtle shift in single - particle energies between the rmf forces nl - z2 and nl3 removes the outer asymmetric barrier for the former , but not the latter .",
    "the single - particle spectra at spherical shape including those far above and below the fermi energy , have to be described with very high precision to decide if there exist superdeformed states in superheavy elements .",
    "we have investigated the systematics of fission barriers in superheavy elements with ,  , 120 as predicted by self - consistent mean - field models . as typical representatives , we employed the non - relativistic skyrme - hartree - fock ( shf ) model as well as the relativistic mean - field model ( rmf ) , and for each case , we used a selection of different parametrizations to explore the variances in the predictions .",

    "a selection of actinide nuclei ranging from th to cf isotopes has been utilized to study the predictions for the inner and outer axial barriers as well the excitation energies of the isomer .",
    "overall , a model dependence of the results has surfaced : rmf forces tend to lower , and often too low , barriers and excitation energies , while most skyrme forces tend to higher values , which sometimes leads to an overestimation on the mean - field level .    for superheavy nuclei",
    "all models and forces agree on the systematic trends concerning the fission barriers , ground state deformations , and fission modes .",
    "there are differences in detail .",

    ", there emerge large and systematic discrepancies between shf and rmf concerning the barrier heights , reaching a factor two for .",
    "this amplifies and confirms the tendency which has been demonstrated for actinides .",
    "the factor two in fission barriers around means in absolute numbers that shf fission barriers are about 5 mev larger and this amounts to many orders of magnitude longer fission lifetimes .",
    "moreover , the shf forces employed here predict also larger barriers than the more phenomenological mic - mac models .",
    "the reason for the systematic difference between shf and rmf have yet to be found out .",
    "we suspect that the difference is caused by a different shell structure in the models .",
    "this point deserves more investigation .",
    "the further systematic trends are shared by shf and rmf .",
    "there is a transition from well - deformed ground states around to nearly spherical ones at , which develops through very soft nuclei which might exhibit shape isomerism .",
    "and there is a marked breakdown of fission stability around in agreement with experimental findings where the @xmath0 chains of superheavy elements are limited at the lower end by fission .",
    "the axially symmetric fission barriers are , of course , only a first indicator of fission stability ( to be more precise an upper limit ) .",
    "one needs yet to include triaxial degrees of freedom and to model the dynamics of fission to obtain life times .",
    "taking into account the results from actinides and superheavy nuclei the mean - fields models used in this study seem to deliver lower ( and probably too low - rmf ) and upper ( shf ) limits for the barrier heights .",
