    "it is widely accepted that low - mass stars are formed through mass accretion in protostellar envelopes @xcite . the dense and warm innermost part of low - mass protostellar envelopes ( radius @xmath9 200 au ) are likely sites of formation of protoplanetary disks @xcite . however , we have very little knowledge about this region because previous mm - wave observations could not separate the warm and dense regions from the overlying low - density ( @xmath10 @xmath11 ) and cold ( @xmath110 k ) gas along the line of sight .",
    "on the other hand , submillimeter molecular lines such as cs ( @xmath0=76 ) trace higher densities ( @xmath12 10@xmath13 @xmath14 ) and temperatures ( @xmath12 60 k ) @xcite , and submillimeter dust continuum emission is an excellent tracer of disks around protostars @xcite .    in this @xmath15",

    "our sma observations provide us with new information of the innermost part of the protostellar envelope .",
    "with the sma , cs ( @xmath0=76 ; 342.88295 ghz ) and 343 ghz continuum observations of l1551 irs 5 were made on 2002 december 18 and 2003 march 13 .",
    "details of the sma are described by ho , moran , & lo ( 2004 ) .",
    "table 1 summarizes the observational parameters .",
    "we confirmed that the visibility amplitudes of the continuum emission from l1551 irs 5 at the two observing periods were consistent within the noise level .",
    "the overall flux uncertainty was estimated to be about 20 @xmath22 .",
    "since the minimum baseline length projected on the sky was 14.8 k@xmath23 , our observations were insensitive to structures more extended than 11@xmath2 ( @xmath1 1500 au ) at the 10% level @xcite .",
    "the raw visibility data were calibrated and flagged with mir , and the calibrated visibility data were fourier - transformed and cleaned with miriad .",
    "we adopted robust = 0.5 weighting for the imaging , which seemed to provide the best compromise between the sensitivity and the spatial resolution .",
    "the rms noise levels of the images were about twice of what is expected , for reasons that are under investigation .",
    "in figure 1 , we show the total integrated intensity map of the cs ( @xmath0=76 ) emission along with the c@xmath24o ( @xmath0=10 ) map taken with the nma by momose et  al .",
    "while the c@xmath24o map reveals a structure of the protostellar envelope , elongated ( @xmath1 2400 au @xmath25 1000 au in size ) perpendicularly to the axis of the associated molecular outflow @xcite , the cs emission shows a structure without clear elongation . from the elliptical gaussian fitting ,",

    "40@xmath26 ) , which corresponds to the diameter of @xmath1 400 au at the distance of l1551 irs 5 .",
    "comparison of the sma flux to the total flux of the cso cs ( @xmath0=76 ) spectrum toward l1551 irs 5 suggests that @xmath27 of the single - dish flux is recovered by the sma at @xmath28 resolution .    in figure 2 , we show the intensity - weighted mean velocity map of l1551 irs 5 in the cs emission .",
    "there is a clear velocity gradient from southeast to northwest , which is perpendicular to the axis of the associated molecular outflow ( ne - sw ; uchida et  al .",
    "1987 , moriarty - schieven & snell 1988 ) .",
    "this direction of the velocity gradient is different from that observed in the c@xmath5o emission @xcite , e.g. , the c@xmath5o envelope shows a velocity gradient from south to north near the central star .",
    "the reason of this difference may be because the cs envelope is more dominated by rotation as compared to the c@xmath5o envelope , which is dominated by infall as well as rotation .    in order to understand the velocity structure better , we made velocity channel maps of the cs emission at different velocity ranges , that is , a `` high - velocity '' ( 5.31 - 5.85 km s@xmath7 and 7.82 - 8.35 km s@xmath7 ) component and a `` low - velocity '' ( 6.39 - 6.74 km s@xmath7 and 6.92 - 7.28 km s@xmath7 ) component . in figure 3",
    "we show the high - velocity and low - velocity components separately , superposed on the 343 ghz dust continuum emission and the vla 3.5 cm radio jet image @xcite .",

    "@xmath299.6 . derived from the elliptical gaussian fitting .",
    "the flux and size are consistent with the estimates from the jcmt - cso interferometric study @xcite , and the dust emission most probably represents the circumbinary disk and the circumstellar disks associated with the protostars , although the circumstellar disks are not spatially resolved .",
    "the high - velocity component in the cs emission spatially coincides with the dust continuum distribution which is approximately perpendicular to the axis of the radio jet @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", there is a slight , but significant spatial discrepancy between the low - velocity component and the dust continuum emission , wherein the low - velocity component is located to the southwest of the dust disk .",
    "the peak of the redshifted low - velocity component seems to lie along the axis of the radio jet .",
    "we discuss these different velocity components in more detail below .",
    "our cs ( @xmath0=76 ) observations have revealed a rather compact ( @xmath4 au ) structure in the inner part of the elongated ( @xmath30 au ) protostellar envelope detected by mm - wave observations @xcite around l1551 irs 5 . the critical gas density traced by the cs line",
    "is expected to be @xmath20 10@xmath13 @xmath14 , and the equivalent temperature of the @xmath0=7 energy level is 66 k. this gas density and temperature are much higher than those traced by the millimeter - wave tracers , such as c@xmath24o ( @xmath0=10 ) ( @xmath31 @xmath14 ; 5 k ) @xcite or h@xmath32co@xmath33 ( @xmath0=10 ) ( @xmath34 @xmath11 ; 4 k ) @xcite . indeed , moriarty - schieven et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) estimated gas density and temperature at the center of the envelope in l1551 irs 5 to be @xmath35 @xmath11 and @xmath36 k from their multi - transitional cs ( @xmath0=32 , 54 , 76 ) observations with jcmt and cso .",
    "part of the difference in the distribution between the cs ( @xmath0=76 ) and c@xmath24o ( @xmath0=10 ) emission shown in figure 1 is likely to be due to the different physical conditions traced by these two molecular lines .",
    "the cs emission line better traces the inner , denser and warmer part of the protostellar envelope .",
    "the compact shape of the cs ( @xmath0=76 ) emission without elongation could be due to the missing flux ( only @xmath1 11@xmath22 recovered ) . however , our simple simulation indicated that , if the distribution of the cs ( @xmath0=76 ) emission were the same as that of the c@xmath5o ( @xmath0=10 ) emission , then the present sma observations would not detect any of the cs emission .",
    "this suggests that there should be a compact structure of the cs emission as well as an extended cs component with @xmath20 11@xmath2 = 1500 au in size .",
    "we note that it is still a puzzle why the cs ( @xmath0=76 ) emission which traces denser and warmer gas can be so extended .",
    "it seems to be difficult to make gas temperature high enough only by the heating from the central stars ( e.g. , lay et  al .",
    ". there might be some external heating sources such as shocks due to infalling and/or outflowing gas @xcite .      as described in @xmath373 , the cs ( @xmath0=76 ) emission in l1551 irs 5 consists of a high - velocity disk - like component and a low - velocity component whose peak locates at the southwest of the protostar . in order to investigate the origin of these velocity components in more detail , in figure 4",
    "we show the position - velocity ( p - v ) diagram of the cs emission along the cut perpendicular to the axis of the radio jet ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "the velocity structure appears to be symmetric with respect to the velocity of 6.8 km s@xmath7 , and we adopt this velocity as a systemic velocity in this paper ( note that this is significantly different from the systemic velocity of c@xmath24o ( @xmath0=10 ) of 6.2 km s@xmath7 ; momose et  al .",
    "solid color curves in figure 4 indicate the keplerian rotation velocity ( @xmath38 @xmath39 ) for a disk with an inclination angle of 65@xmath26 @xcite and with a central stellar mass of 0.15 m@xmath40 ( red ) , 0.5 m@xmath40 ( green ) , and 1.2 m@xmath40 ( blue ) .",
    "the central stellar mass of 0.15 m@xmath40 was estimated by momose et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) from their detailed kinematic analyses of the c@xmath24o infalling envelope , and that of 1.2 m@xmath40 by rodrguez et  al .",
    "( 2003a ) from the proper motion analyses of the binary .",
    "dashed curves in figure 4 show rotation with angular momentum conserved , that is , @xmath41 .",
    "momose et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) argued that this rotation law can explain the observed p - v diagram of the c@xmath24o infalling envelope .",
    "the high - velocity component , with relative velocities of @xmath42 1.01.5 km s@xmath7 in figure 4 , seems to be consistent with the keplerian rotation with a central stellar mass of 0.15 m@xmath40 or the rotation with the constant angular momentum , and is likely to be the rotating circumbinary disk at the innermost of the envelope .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult for us to distinguish these two rotation curves to explain the kinematics of the high - velocity component with the current sensitivity .",
    "keplerian rotation curves with higher ( @xmath12 1.0 m@xmath40 ) stellar masses show too high velocities as compared to the cs p - v diagram .",
    "in contrast , the low - velocity component ( @xmath420.5 km s@xmath7 from the systemic velocity ) seems not to follow these rotation curves .",
    "the spatial offset of the low - velocity component from the dust disk and the possible coincidence with the radio jet ( figure 3 ) may suggest that the origin of the low - velocity component is outflow - related .",
    "interestingly , at the south - western tip of the radio jet where the peaks of the low - velocity component locate , bally , feigelson , & reipurth ( 2003 ) have detected x - ray emission with @xmath43 , which they attribute to shocks caused by the jet .",
    "one interpretation therefore is that the low - velocity component is the shocked warm and dense molecular material pushed by the radio jet .",
    "however , one difficulty of this interpretation may be its `` low velocity '' .",
    "the projected separation between the peaks of the low - velocity component and the continuum peak is @xmath1 100 au , and the line of sight velocities of the low - velocity component is only @xmath1 a few @xmath25 0.1 km s@xmath7 . in order for the low - velocity component to escape from the gravitational potential of the central star with a mass of 0.15 m@xmath40 @xcite",
    ", the angle between the flow and the plane of sky must be less than 10@xmath26 , while uchida et  al .",
    "( 1987 ) estimated the inclination angle of 15@xmath26 from their large - scale co outflow map .",
    "it is important to compare our p - v diagram with those calculated using a model envelope with a vertical structure , because models of flared envelopes having infall as well as rotation yield peaks at lower velocity near the central star in their p - v diagrams cut along the major axis @xcite .",
    "the reason why these peaks at lower velocity appear near the central star is because infalling motions in the near- and far - side of the envelope are observed together with rotation in the same line of sight .",
    "these peaks can not be explained with rotation curves calculated using spatially thin disk models , which is very similar to our case shown in figure 4 .",
    "it is therefore possible that a model envelope having vertical structures with infall and rotation motions may explain the lower velocity component .",
    "the effect of the missing flux prevents us from arriving at a clear interpretation .",
    "the lower - velocity component could be part of spatially extended component , which can often be seen at lower velocities .",
    "further observations with shorter spacings using the sma should provide us with the more obvious view and interpretation of these velocity structures of warm and dense gas in the innermost part of the protostellar envelope .",
