    "<S> the model of competition between densities of two different species , called predator and prey , is studied on a one dimensional periodic lattice , where each site can be in one of the four states say , empty , or occupied by a single predator , or occupied by a single prey , or by both . </S>",
    "<S> along with the pairwise death of predators and growth of preys , we introduce an interaction where the predators can eat one of the neighboring prey and reproduce a new predator there instantly . </S>",
    "<S> the model shows a non - equilibrium phase transition into a unusual absorbing state where predators are absent and the lattice is fully occupied by preys . </S>",
    "<S> the critical exponents of the system are found to be different from that of the directed percolation universality class and they are robust against addition of explicit diffusion .    </S>",
    "<S> ^s__a    absorbing configurations do not have any outgoing rates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> once reached there , the system can not escape from these configurations . </S>",
    "<S> presence of absorbing configurations in a phase space raises a possibility that the concerned system may undergo a non - equilibrium phase transition into absorbing states . </S>",
    "<S> the critical behavior of these absorbing state phase transitions ( apt)s @xcite depends on the conservation in dynamics and the symmetry between absorbing states . </S>",
    "<S> it has been conjectured @xcite that in absence of any special symmetry the apt belong to the directed percolation ( dp ) universality class as long as the system has a single absorbing state . </S>",
    "<S> additional symmetries , like particle - hole symmetry @xcite , conservation of parity @xcite , and symmetry between different absorbing states @xcite lead to different universalities . spreading process with spatially quenched randomness @xcite or with long - term memory @xcite </S>",
    "<S> are known to destroy the critical behavior completely , whereas the presence of infinitely many absorbing states may @xcite or may not @xcite belong to dp universality class . again a different critical behavior is observed when the activity field does not have any special symmetry , but it is coupled to a conserved density @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent studies have indicated that dp - critical behavior is possible , even in presence of an additional conserved field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is not quite clear , what microscopic ingredients can make an apt belong to the dp class .    the models of directed percolation has been extended to more than one species @xcite . along with the simple dp behavior , a line of first order transition @xcite has been observed in @xmath0 dimension when two species compete for survival . </S>",
    "<S> janssen @xcite studied coupled dp processes with bilinear and bidirectional interspecies couplings in the framework of bosonic field theory , where no other critical phenomena were found other than the dp . </S>",
    "<S> hierarchy of unidirectionally coupled dp processes with many species show multicritical behavior @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> coupled percolation processes have been also studied @xcite , where the absorbing phase become unstable with respect to an arbitrarily small branching rate even in one dimension .    </S>",
    "<S> predator - prey cellular automaton models @xcite in two dimension show dp universality class . coupled directed percolation ( dp ) processes with more than two species of particles ( in one dimension ) with different kind of interspecies coupling have shown dp - type @xcite transitions . </S>",
    "<S> lotka - volterra like models in one dimension always show coexistence @xcite , either in form of well mixed states or as irregular bursts of the predator and prey population . </S>",
    "<S> a four state predator prey model @xcite in one dimension with a restriction that a site can have at best one particle of each kind , shows an apt to an absorbing ( extinct ) state which belongs to dp - class .    in this article we study a model of two species , say @xmath1 ( prey ) and @xmath2 ( predator ) , on a @xmath3-dimensional lattice . </S>",
    "<S> each lattice site is either vacant @xmath4 or occupied by at best one particle of each kind . </S>",
    "<S> the preys grow independently as @xmath5 and the predators die as @xmath6 , whereas they interact through a process @xmath7 , where birth of a new predator occurs instantly along with the death of the prey . </S>",
    "<S> the system show a line of continuous absorbing state transition different from dp as the rates of these processes are tuned . </S>",
    "<S> unlike other multispecies models , in the absorbing state both preys and predators do not separately extinct , rather predators extinct and preys proliferate to fill up the whole prey branch .        </S>",
    "<S> the model is defined on a one dimensional periodic lattice with lattice sites labelled by @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> each site @xmath9 can be either vacant or occupied by a single particle @xmath1 ( prey ) , or occupied by a single particle @xmath2 ( predator ) or by both particles ( co - existing @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) , thus the model can be treated as 4-state predator - prey ( 4spp ) model . </S>",
    "<S> more than one particle of any kind is not allowed . these hardcore restrictions on individual particles , where co - existence is allowed , can be realized alternatively by considering two separate branches , one for @xmath1 and the other for @xmath2 particles . </S>",
    "<S> particles living in one branch can not move to the other branch , as schematically shown in the fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : model ] . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , each site @xmath9 is associated with four states ; @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) denotes the presence ( absence ) of a particle at site @xmath9 . on a periodic lattice , </S>",
    "<S> these given below .        </S>",
    "<S> the prey ( @xmath1 ) can grow on their own branch with rate @xmath14 independent of the predators ( @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> again , two neighboring predators ( @xmath2 ) die simultaneously with rate @xmath15 independent of @xmath1 due to their own crowding or overpopulation . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 in @xmath1-branch ( @xmath2-branch ) corresponds to an arbitrary state of @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) particles i.e. presence or absence . </S>",
    "<S> these two species interact with rate @xmath17 as follows ; when a predator @xmath2 at site @xmath9 meets a prey @xmath1 as the right neighbor @xmath18 , with site @xmath18 is not already occupied by a predator @xmath2 , then the predator @xmath2 eats the prey @xmath1 and simultaneously reproduces another predator @xmath2 . effect </S>",
    "<S> on addition of symmetry and diffusion are briefly discussed towards the end .    </S>",
    "<S> let the steady state density of @xmath1 and @xmath2 particles be @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively . clearly in absence of predators ( @xmath20 ) the prey density @xmath21 as the preys do not have an independent death process . </S>",
    "<S> again , note that the dynamics do not allow @xmath1 particles to be eaten when they co - exist with @xmath2 on the same site . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that these @xmath1s can only die after their coexisting @xmath2s die , which can occur with rate @xmath15 if there is a @xmath2 particle present or created at the immediate left neighbor . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for reasonably small death rate of predators , @xmath19 is expected to have a small value ( @xmath22 ) when @xmath23 and then it increases along with @xmath24 so , the prey density @xmath19 can never vanish . </S>",
    "<S> the predator density @xmath20 can , however , become zero by repetitive death process . </S>",
    "<S> the isolated @xmath2s wait until the prey invades their neighboring site and then they subsequently eat and reproduce with rate @xmath17 and die with rate @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> so , along with the _ coexisting phase _ where both @xmath19 and @xmath20 are non - zero , we have another phase where @xmath21 and @xmath25 clearly , the later phase @xmath26 is absorbing as once all the predators die , even then the single surviving prey can lead to proliferation of the prey population in the whole lattice . of course , as argued earlier , @xmath19 can not vanish , and the other possible absorbing state @xmath27 which requires simultaneous death of all predators and preys , is not dynamically accessible . thus the 4spp model can undergo an absorbing state phase transition by tuning the different rates with @xmath20 as the order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> our aim here is to study this critical behavior in details .    </S>",
    "<S> we have used the standard monte carlo methods to study the critical behavior of this model . from an initial arbitrary configuration , where each branch @xmath1 and @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> are filled by arbitrary number of respective particles , the system is allowed to evolve according to the random sequential update following the monte carlo dynamics of 4spp model . </S>",
    "<S> we have studied the system with different values of the rates @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath17 with system size @xmath28 . for illustration , </S>",
    "<S> we have fixed two of the reaction rates , say @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and vary @xmath14 as the the control parameter in the following simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath31 the average @xmath2 density @xmath20 decreases continuously until the system reaches a state with no predators ( @xmath32 ) and ultimately the whole prey lattice branch is filled with preys . </S>",
    "<S> once reached in this absorbing state @xmath26 , the system remains there forever . while , for @xmath33 the average density of @xmath2 particles @xmath20 saturates to a nonzero value along with @xmath19 which also takes a value smaller than unity . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phase](a ) we have plotted @xmath19 and @xmath20 as a function of @xmath14 for a system size @xmath34 as expected , the density of the preys @xmath19 never vanish and they proliferates in the whole lattice ( with @xmath21 ) in the absorbing state where predators are absent . </S>",
    "<S> thus the system undergoes an absorbing state phase transition as the birth rate of preys @xmath14 crosses a critical threshold @xmath35     is plotted against the control parameter @xmath14 for fixed value of @xmath36 and @xmath28 , critical point is indicated at @xmath37 showing absorbing to active phase transition . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : beta_nu](a ) , @xmath20 versus @xmath53 is linear in log scale , for the correct choice of @xmath37 ; the corresponding slope @xmath41 gives the estimated value of the order parameter exponent .    </S>",
    "<S> one can obtain few other critical exponents from the decay of the order parameter @xmath54 from an initial configuration with large number of predators . clearly , in the vicinity of critical point @xmath42 is a function of time @xmath55 and the temporal correlation length @xmath56 which vary as @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> again , after an initial decay @xmath58 the predator density in the active phase approaches the steady state value @xmath20 in the @xmath59 limit . </S>",
    "<S> so @xmath42 must scale as , @xmath60 thus , one expects that @xmath54 for different values of @xmath14 ( shown in the fig . </S>",

    "<S> again , in the upper critical regime , @xmath20 vanishes as @xmath67 , in the @xmath68 limit . </S>",
    "<S> this can happen only when the off - critical scaling function @xmath69 ; thus @xmath70 since all three exponents @xmath52 , @xmath66 and @xmath71 are calculated independently , one can check if the above scaling relation holds . in this case </S>",
    "<S> it holds to a great accuracy for the values of @xmath52 , @xmath66 and @xmath71 calculated here .     </S>",

    "<S> again , the system of length @xmath77 with a high density of predators @xmath78 decays as @xmath79 , indicating a scaling form @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the dynamic critical exponent . </S>",

    "<S> the preys are allowed to grow independent of the predators , whereas two predators , if present at the neighboring sites , die simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> the species interact through a dynamics where the predator produces an offspring by eating a prey from its neighbor . </S>",
    "<S> when the predator density @xmath32 , even a single prey can invade the whole lattice by its independent birth process . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the system has an unusual absorbing state @xmath111 the other absorbing state @xmath112 is not dynamically accessible . using dynamical monte - carlo simulation </S>",
    "<S> we show that the system shows an absorbing state phase transition , as the birth rate of prey @xmath14 is increased beyond a critical value @xmath51 keeping death rate of predator @xmath15 fixed . for a fixed @xmath17 , the line of criticality ( @xmath51 as a function of @xmath15 ) </S>",
    "<S> is governed by a universality class different from the most generic one , namely directed percolation . </S>",
    "<S> this critical behavior is found to be robust against addition of explicit diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> note that the dynamical rules of the model is different from other four species predator prey models studied earlier @xcite in a way that the predators in 4spp model can not eat the prey at the same site . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that , non - equilibrium phase transition to a unusual and unique absorbing state , may result in different universality class . </S>",
    "<S> further study in this direction could clarify this issue . </S>"
