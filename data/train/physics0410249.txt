    "the earth s mantle is the spherical shell composed of silicate rocks , and it ranges from approximately 5 - 50 km to 2900 km depth .",
    "although the mantle behaves like an elastic solid on short time scales , it acts like a highly viscous fluid on long time scales .",
    "the mantle also acts as a heat engine , and it is in a convective motion in order to transport the heat from the hot interior to the cool surface @xcite .",
    "the mantle convection is observed as the motion of tectonic plates at the earth s surface . the motion of surface plates , in turn , drives seismicity , volcanism and mountain building at the plate margins .",
    "thus , the mantle convection is the origin of the geological and geophysical phenomena observed at the earth s surface . a major tool for understanding the mantle convection is numerical analysis .",
    "it has been playing an important role in the study of mantle convection , since a numerical simulation of mantle convection first arose @xcite .",
    "mantle convection requires different numerical techniques from those for ordinary fluids such as water because of its rheological properties .",
    "the viscosity of mantle materials is estimated as high as @xmath1 pa s @xcite . since the mantle materials is highly viscous ,",
    "both the nonlinear and time - derivative terms of velocity can be ignored in the equation of motion .",
    "this implies that the flow in the mantle is described by a steady - state stokes flow balancing among the buoyancy force , pressure gradient and viscous resistance .",
    "taken together with the assumption of incompressibility , one needs to solve elliptic differential equations for velocity and pressure at every timestep .",
    "in addition , the viscosity of mantle material varies by several orders of magnitude depending on temperature , pressure , and stress @xcite .",
    "the strong variation in viscosity makes numerical techniques for ordinary isoviscous fluids , such as the spectral method @xcite , unfit for the numerical modeling of mantle convection . in order to get deep insights into the mantle convection",
    ", it is very important to develop efficient numerical techniques that can deal with the steady - state flow of highly viscous and incompressible fluids with a strongly variable viscosity .",
    "the efficiency of numerical simulations of mantle convection strongly relies on numerical methods used for solving elliptic differential equations .",
    "one of the most efficient methods is the multigrid iteration @xcite .",
    "the multigrid concept has been successfully applied to a wide range of problems , including calculations of incompressible fluid flow @xcite . during the last two decades",
    ", various numerical models of mantle convection have been developed where the multigrid method is utilized .",
    "there are two strategies to apply the multigrid method to this problem , depending on how the steady - state stokes equations are solved .",
    "the first strategy solves the stokes equations by splitting into the separate equations for velocities and pressure .",
    "the discretized equations for velocity components ( or their proxy ) are solved by the multigrid method , while the pressure is eliminated or solved separately .",
    "parmentier et al .",
    "@xcite developed convection models of isoviscous fluid in three - dimensional cartesian geometry . by using a streamfunction formulation ,",
    "the stokes equations are reduced to a pair of poisson equations which are solved by multigrid iterations .",
    "baumgardner and his colleagues developed convection models for fluids with constant @xcite and moderately variable viscosity @xcite in a three - dimensional spherical geometry .",
    "they solved the elliptic equations for velocity components using a multigrid method , while the pressure fields are prescribed by the equation of state .",
    "moresi and his colleagues @xcite developed a model for convection problems with strongly variable viscosity in two- and three - dimensional cartesian geometry .",
    "the stokes equations are solved separately for velocity and pressure by so - called uzawa iterative scheme .",
    "the iteration for velocity is carried out by a multigrid method , while a conjugate gradient scheme is used for pressure iteration .",
    "the second strategy , on the other hand , solves the stokes equations for velocity and pressure as a whole by the multigrid technique .",
    "the key issue of this strategy is a choice of the smoothing algorithm which reduces the errors of solution on a particular grid .",
    "several methods for solving incompressible fluid flows have been utilized as a smoothing algorithm .",
    "trompert and hansen @xcite and albers @xcite developed numerical methods for convection problems with variable viscosity in three - dimensional cartesian geometry .",
    "the stokes equations are solved by a multigrid method where the simpler algorithm @xcite is employed as a smoothing operation .",
    "auth and harder @xcite used the symmetric coupled gauss - seidel ( scgs ) method @xcite as a smoothing operation in the multigrid method for solving the stokes equation .",
    "tackley @xcite employed a similar smoothing method where the velocity and pressure fields are updated in a somewhat coupled manner , and his method has been successfully applied to a variety of convection problems @xcite , including calculations with extremely variable viscosity @xcite .    in this paper , we present a solution algorithm for the three - dimensional mantle convection , following the second strategy where the stokes equations are solved as a whole by the multigrid method . in section [ method - section ]",
    "we introduce our solution algorithm based on the pseudo - compressibility method @xcite .",
    "a notable feature of our algorithm is its simplicity and intuitiveness .",
    "this feature makes the algorithm easily fit to a smoothing operation of the multigrid iterations .",
    "in addition , taken together with the local time - stepping method , a strong variation in viscosity can be handled without a severe increase in computational costs . in section [ result - section ] , we develop a numerical model of mantle convection that can deal with a strongly variable viscosity based on the algorithm presented in section [ method - section ] together with the multigrid technique . in order to demonstrate the validity and efficiency of our algorithm",
    ", we carry out several calculations for the mantle convection with a strongly variable viscosity . in this paper , an application of our algorithm is the thermal convection in a three - dimensional rectangular domain .",
    "it can be easily applied to the numerical models for more realistic problems of mantle convection , such as spherical shell geometry and thermo - chemical convection and so on .",

    "we then calculate the approximate at the iteration @xmath32 by , @xmath33 here a regular matrix @xmath34 is introduced so as to control the convergence rate of ( [ ax = b - iter ] ) , and is chosen to be a diagonal matrix whose nonzero elements are positive",
    ". this iterative procedure is used together with the multigrid method , and is repeated until @xmath29 converges to a steady solution .",

    "in addition , the presence of zero block in the main diagonal of @xmath28 does not spoil the convergence of this iterative procedure .",
    "this iterative algorithm is suitable for large - scale numerical simulations on massively parallel computers and , in particular , massively vector - parallel supercomputers because ( i ) the procedure ( [ ax = b - iter ] ) consists of multiplication of matrices and vectors and summation of vectors and , hence , can be easily vectorized and parallelized , and ( ii ) large memory storage for the matrix @xmath34 is not required , since @xmath34 is a diagonal matrix .",
    "another benefit of the iterative procedure ( [ ax = b - iter ] ) is that it is easily implemented into the multigrid method .",
