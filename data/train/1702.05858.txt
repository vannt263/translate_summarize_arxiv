    "multi - object multi - sensor management / control is a challenging optimal nonlinear control problem focused on directing multiple sensors to obtain _ most informative _",
    "measurements for the purpose of multi - object filtering  @xcite .",
    "this problem is different from classical control problems as the overall controlled system is a highly complex stochastic multi - object system , where not only the number of objects vary randomly in time , but also the measurements returned by each sensor are subject to missed detections and false alarms .",
    "indeed , the multi - object state and multi - object observations are inherently finite - set - valued , and standard optimal control techniques are not directly applicable .    in stochastic multi - object systems , we can still cast the multi - object multi - sensor control problem as a partially observed markov decision process ( pomdp ) , where the states and observations are instead finite - set - valued , and control vectors are drawn from a set of admissible sensor actions based on the current information states , which are then assessed against the values of an objective function associated with each multi - sensor action  @xcite . in this framework , a solution would include three major steps : ( 1 ) modeling the overall system as a stochastic multi - object system , ( 2 ) devising a tractable ( accurate or approximate ) way to propagate the multi - object posterior , and ( 3 ) solving an optimization problem to find the multi - sensor control command , according to an objective function .",
    "this paper presents a formulation of the multi - sensor control problem as a pomdp with finite - set - valued states and measurements , a labeled random set filter used to propagate the multi - object posterior , and a task - driven objective ( cost ) function .    to our knowledge ,",

    "the approach opted by meng  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite to solve the multi - sensor control problem is an _ exhaustive search _ scheme , in which the objective function is computed for all possible combinations of sensor control actions .",
    "this approach works well for a few sensors only , but in presence of numerous sensors , may become computationally intractable .",
    "the major contribution of this paper is the introduction of a guided search to solve the multi - dimensional discrete optimization problem embedded in multi - sensor control .",
    "we avoid the curse of dimensionality by using an accelerated scheme inspired by the coordinate descent method  @xcite .",
    "this leads to significant improvement in the runtime of the algorithm and its real - time feasibility , especially in presence of numerous sensors .",
    "another contribution is the detailed sequential monte - carlo ( smc ) implementation of the proposed multi - sensor control framework with labeled multi - bernoulli  ( lmb ) filters running in each sensor node .",
    "the novel idea inherent in the proposed smc implementation is that sensor control and the actual filters are all implemented using the same particles , hence substantial savings are achieved in terms of memory and computational requirements .",
    "we also experimentally analyse the computational complexity of the proposed method and demonstrate that it varies almost quadratically with the number of controlled sensors ( polynomial complexity ) .",
    "this is while an exhaustive search similar to the one used in  @xcite has exponential ( hence , non - polynomial ) complexity .",
    "extensive simulation studies involving numerous controllable sensors demonstrate that our method returns acceptable tracking results quantified in terms of ospa error values  @xcite .",
    "indeed , in comparison to the state of art ( running exhaustive search in an approach similar to  @xcite ) , the proposed multi - sensor control method returns similar tracking errors but converges significantly faster .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : prob_stat ] presents a formalized statement of the multi - sensor control problem in pomdp framework and sets out the background and design requirements for various components of the framework .",

''",
    "the system is modeled as a one - step - ahead markovian process which is characterized by a transition density @xmath6 .",
    "a practical approximation for the process can be formulated based on assuming that while transiting from time @xmath7 to time @xmath0 , each existing object @xmath8 independently continues to exist with a survival probability @xmath9 and single - object transition density @xmath10 , and a number of new objects are born according to a given rfs density .    at each time",
    "@xmath0 , the multi - object state is partially observed by a network of @xmath11 sensors , each returning a set of measurements ( called detections or point measurements ) .",

    "the space of measurement sets will be @xmath16 .",
    "each sensor @xmath17 can be controlled ( e.g. translated , rotated ) according to a sensor command @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a finite space of sensor commands .",

    "the recursion and has no analytic solution in general .",
    "an smc implementation of the bayes multi - object filter ( with rfs states without labels ) is given in  @xcite .",
    "however , this technique is computationally prohibitive which at best is able to accommodate a small number of targets .",
    "this smc implementation of the multi - object bayes filter was employed by the multi - target sensor control algorithm proposed in  @xcite .    due to general intractability of propagation of the full posterior density given by and ,",
    "several alternatives have been proposed which are designed to propagate important statistics or parameters instead of the full posterior .",
    "well - known examples of such filters are probability hypothesis density ( phd ) filter and its cardinalized version ( cphd )  @xcite , and the multi - bernoulli filter and its cardinality - balanced version ( cb - member )  @xcite . in a series of works  @xcite , various implementations of these filters such as smc and track - before - detect ( tbd ) were introduced , as well as a robust version of multi - bernoulli filter .",
    "these methods can not generate target tracks ( using labels ) in a rigorously mathematical way , and are usually applied in conjunction with a label management strategy  @xcite .",
    "since 2010 , a series of random set filters have been developed , in which the multi - object random state includes label .",
    "the _ labeled random finite sets _ were shown to admit conjugacy of a particular form of prior density ( the vo - vo density ) with the general multiple point measurement set likelihood  @xcite . following this result ,",
