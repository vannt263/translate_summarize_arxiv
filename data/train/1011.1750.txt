    "x - ray spectra from seyfert galaxies are never represented by a simple power - law , but a wide range of reprocessed features such as absorption , emission and absorption lines , reflection , and so on ( turner and miller 2009 ) .",
    "such features are vital to probe the surrounding material around central supermassive black holes , such as accretion disk or flow , torus , and clouds . since such materials are fuel for massive black holes , information on the evolution of the supermassive black holes can be obtained by studying them .",
    "the most prominent feature is the photoelectric absorption of the continuum in the soft x - ray band , where both cold and warm absorbers are found .",
    "the cold matter is thought to be associated with a molecular torus . for compton - thin objects with a cold absorption column density of @xmath11 @xmath1 ,",
    "@xmath12 can be determined by observations below 10 kev .",
    "based on the observations with bepposax , swift / bat , and integral , a significant fraction of seyfert galaxies exhibit a compton - thick cold absorption ( risaliti et al .",
    "1999 ; beckmann et al . 2006 ; tueller et al .",
    "2008 ) , and the direct nuclear x - ray emission of such objects can not be observed below 10 kev .",
    "the location and geometry of the cold absorber is now extensively studied .",
    "matt ( 2000 ) pointed out that the compton - thin absorber differs from the compton - thick molecular torus and is associated with the interstellar medium in the parent galaxy .",
    "the rapid time variation of the absorption column density indicates that some of the cold absorbers exist as a blob - like cloud ( e.g. elvis et al .",
    "compton - thick seyfert 2 galaxies also exhibit a complex absorption feature , possibly due to partial covering and so on ( comastri et al .",
    "some of the compton - thick objects exhibit no optical activity and weak scattering x - ray component , indicating that the torus is geometrically thicker than ever thought ( ueda et al .",
    "a warm absorber due to ionized clouds has often emerged .",
    "although initially recognized through an ionized absorption edge in the soft x - ray band ( halpern 1984 ) , a lower - density absorber has also recently emerged via detection of soft x - ray and uv absorption lines ( e.g. kaspi et al .",
    "these absorption materials are also observed as reflectors or scatterers , and many emission lines in the optical to x - ray band are detected from seyfert galaxies ( e.g. kaspi et al .",
    "2002 ) , as are wide - ranging ionization states ; for example , the ionization state of iron ranges from 0 to 26 .",
    "these materials are considered to be related to the evolution of the central black hole and engine .",
    "a recent x - ray survey revealed that heavily absorbed agns lack high luminosity ( e.g. ueda et al .",
    "2003 ; winter et al .",
    "2009 ) , while blue - shifted absorption lines sometimes emerge in high luminosity agns ( pounds et al . 2003 ; reeves et al . 2003 ) , indicating a relativistic massive outflow , which is promising feedback for the parent galaxy evolution . with this in mind",
    ", it is important to obtain a general view of materials around the supermassive black hole to understand the coevolution of the black hole and galaxy .",
    "the physical properties of environmental materials are subject to the luminosity of the central engine .",
    "it is also important to understand the complex x - ray spectra of seyfert galaxies and derive the intrinsic spectral shape , to clarify the physical view of the central engine , while correct modeling of the x - ray continuum emission is also required to evaluate the disk line and the reflection component .",
    "however , the absorption column density and intrinsic luminosity of compton - thick seyfert galaxies can not be measured below 10 kev .",
    "in addition , reflection component constraint requires wide x - ray band spectroscopy .",
    "bepposax and/or xmm - newton has provided opportunities for such studies , but the energy resolution of bepposax around fe - k lines is too poor to resolve the broad / narrow , neutral / ionized , or absorption lines respectively .",
    "the variability of seyfert galaxies means broadband x - ray spectral shapes can not be ensured when observations below and above 10 kev are not simultaneous .",
    "however , the suzaku xis / hxd combination ( mitsuda et al . 2007 ; koyama et al . 2007 ; takahashi et al . 2007 ; kokubun et al .",
    "2007 ) is relatively powerful for such studies , thanks to its wide x - ray band , good energy resolution , and well - calibrated response .",
    "since the typical exposure time of agns with suzaku is longer than 50 ks , the signal - to - noise ratio of data is very high . here , we report systematic studies of the fe - k line features of seyfert galaxies and their dependence on intrinsic luminosity and the cold absorber .",
    "we evaluated the fe line features as free from the modeling as possible to avoid the model dependence of physical quantities , such as solid angles and fe abundance .",
    "the disk line was not treated in this paper , since it depends on continuum modeling .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt a hubble constant of @xmath1370 km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 .",
    "the solar abundance ratio is referred to as the solar photospheric values of anders and grevesse ( 1989 ) for photoelectric absorption and reflection , and the cross - section for the absorption model is set to that of bauci@xmath14ska - church and mccammon ( 1992 ) .",
    "the errors are typically shown at a 1@xmath15 confidence level for one interesting parameter .",
    "we selected seyfert galaxies from the archived suzaku data as of september 2009 .",
    "initially , we examine xis and hxd spectra , whereupon the objects detected with hxd - pin were chosen .",
    "the hxd - pin detection is important to constrain the compton - thick absorption column density and measure the intrinsic luminosity free from absorption .",
    "this condition leads to the selection of objects which are bright enough to analyze the fe - k line feature with a good signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "consequently , we analyzed 88 objects , about 36% of which were seyfert 1 galaxies ( @xmath16 @xmath1 ) , about 33% compton - thin seyfert 2 galaxies ( @xmath17 @xmath1 @xmath18 @xmath1 ) , and about 31% compton - thick seyfert 2 galaxies ( @xmath19 @xmath1 ) .",
    "all the objects were observed in xis 5x5 or 3x3 modes and normal hxd mode .",
    "we screened the data with suzaku standard selection criteria and the xis photons accumulated within 4 arcmin of the object , with the xis- 0 , 2 , and 3 data coadded to derive the spectrum .",
    "the xis rmf and arf files were created with xisrmfgen and xisarfgen ( ishisaki et al .",
    "2008 ) , respectively , and the xis detector background was estimated with xisnxbgen ( tawa et al .",
    "for the hxd , the `` tuned '' pin and gso background was used ( fukazawa et al .",
    "2009 ) and the good time interval ( gti ) was determined by taking the logical - and of gtis among xis data , hxd data , and hxd background data . for the xis and hxd - pin",
    ", cxb was added to the background spectrum thus obtained , although negligible for the hxd - gso .",
    "the gso response correction file _ ae_hxd_gsoxinom_20070424.arf _ was also utilized , which compensated for any disparity of 1020% between the crab spectral model and the data for the current response matrix ( takahashi et al .",
    "2008 ) . in the simultaneous spectral fitting of xis and hxd , a constant factor of 1.13 was introduced for both pin and gso against the xis .",
    "in order to study the fe - k line features , we initially determined the baseline continuum model . since the suzaku spectra of most seyfert galaxies",
    "can not be expressed by a simple power - law model plus absorption , we added a reflection component and an fe - k line and fitted the spectra above the 3 kev ( model a ) .",
    "we applied the _ pexrav _ model ( zdziarski et al .",
    "1995 ) for the reflection component .",
    "we include both the galactic and object - intrinsic absorptions .",
    "the former was fixed to the value in dickey & lockman ( 1990 ) . for the latter ,",
    "the column density and fe abundance were left free and other elemental abundances were fixed to 1 solar . for the reflection component , fe abundance and reflection fraction @xmath20 were left free , but the fe abundance was tied to that of the absorption .",
    "the parameters of the input power - law emission for the pexrav model were fixed to that of the above power - law model , and the inclination @xmath21 to @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath21 was related to the relative intensity of the reflection component , alongside @xmath20 .",
    "since the latter was a free parameter , the fixing of @xmath21 did not significantly affect the results on continuum modeling .",
    "after obtaining these spectral parameters , we restricted the energy band to the range 59 kev , and fixed the absorption , reflection fraction , and powerlaw photon index , where the powerlaw normalization was the single free parameter for the continuum model .",
    "we included five gaussians ( model b ) , considering lines of 6.4 kev , 6.7 kev ( he - like ) , 7.0 kev ( h - like ) , and 7.09 kev ( neutral fe - k@xmath23 ) .",
    "although the line energy and width of 6.4 kev were let free .",
    "the center energy of other lines was fixed to the value in the rest frame , and their line width was 0 kev . while a negative value was allowed for the normalization of ionized fe - k lines ; 6.7 and 7.0 kev .",
    "the intensity of the fe - k@xmath23 line was fixed to 0.125 of the fe - k@xmath7 intensity ( palmeri et al .2003 ) , since it is usually too weak to measure accurately in most cases .",
    "we do not consider a disk - line , since the disk - line feature could affect the continuum modeling , leading to the systematic uncertainty of the equivalent width .",
    "however , since its shape resembles that of the reflection continuum , we believe that the affection is reduced by including the _ pexrav _ model even if the disk - line exists .    apart from the line studies , we also obtained the absorption column density for discussion .",
    "although the soft x - ray band could not be reproduced well by a simple model , we fit the spectra with a single power - law model plus gaussian , multiplied by the absorption and differing from model a in that the metal abundances of all elements were fixed to 1 solar ( model c ) . the energy band for fitting",
    "was limited to higher energy than for model a so that complex spectral features in the soft x - ray band could be neglected .",
    "recently , it was revealed that the absorption feature of seyfert galaxies is more complex than is represented by the single column density ( e.g. comastri et al . 2010 ) , meaning that the column density obtained in this fitting is a typical or representative value for each object .",
    "since we excluded the soft x - ray band , the complex absorption feature in the soft x - ray band did not affect the results for the fe - k line intensities and the flux in 10 - 50 kev .    finally , in order to obtain the fe - k edge properties , we added the edge model into model b. since the reflection and absorption include a fe - k edge feature , the fe abundance of these components was fixed to 0 solar and other elemental abundances to 1 solar , respectively .",
    "we derived the edge energy by allowing the edge energy and depth to be free . to obtain the edge depth @xmath24 , the edge energy was fixed to 7.112 kev ( x - ray transition energy database http://www.nist.gov/physlab/data/xraytrans/index.cfm ) .    in table 1 , we summarize the fitting results for fe - k line features , together with the absorption column density , x - ray flux , and luminosity in 1050 kev where the absorption less affects the observed flux : for example , the observed flux is a maximum of 1.5 times as small as the absorption - corrected one in the case of @xmath25 @xmath1 with 1 solar abundance .",
    "figure [ fespec ] shows a sample of xis spectra around the fe - k line features , where only the best - fit continuum model is shown for comparison .",
    "figure [ fe64enesig ] shows the plots of center energy and width for the 6.4 kev line .",
    "objects with well - determined values reveal center energy within 6.376.42 kev and average and variance of 6.399 and 0.008 kev , respectively .",
    "although the uncertainty of the xis energy scale is 0.010.03 kev at 6 kev , the average center energy of the 6.4 kev line is consistent with a neutral or low - ionized fe - k fluorescence line , which constrains the ionization state to @xmath26 ( kallman et al .",
    "the line energy is not dependent on the absorption column density ; the average and variance are 6.390 and 0.017 kev for @xmath27 @xmath1 , 6.397 and 0.009 kev for @xmath28 @xmath1 , and 6.400 and 0.014 kev for @xmath29 @xmath1 , respectively . the width is constrained to be @xmath30 km s@xmath10 or @xmath31 ev for objects with well - determined values , and also independent of the absorption column density ; the average and variance are 55 and 25 ev for @xmath32 @xmath1 , and 38 and 26 ev for @xmath33 @xmath1 . these constraints are almost similar to those derived for certain individual objects ( e.g. yaqoob et al .",
    "2007 ; shirai et al . 2008",
    "; awaki et al .",
    "2008 ) , but the results confirm this as a common feature .",
    "figure [ nh64ew ] plots an equivalent width ( ew ) of the 6.4 kev line against the absorption column density .",
    "thanks to effective absorption column density constraints by the hxd data , the clearest ever correlation was obtained ( e.g. guainazzi et al .",
    "2005 ) , between the ew and absorption ; a positive correlation above @xmath34 @xmath1 , and an almost constant ew around 50120 ev below @xmath34 @xmath1 .",
    "the ew distribution for compton - thin objects are in good agreement with that of xmm - newton ( bianchi et al .",
    "the positive correlation is also in good agreement with the prediction of the fluorescence line by the compton - thick torus with various column density ( e.g. awaki et al .",
    "1991 ; ikeda et al .",
    "note that a clear correlation within the range @xmath35 @xmath1 is seen and the ew is 400700 ev at @xmath36 @xmath1 .",
    "since a typical torus structure with @xmath36 @xmath1 and 1 solar fe abundance causes ew of 600700 ev for the 6.4 kev line ( awaki et al .",
    "1991 ; ghisellini et al . 1994 ; ikeda et al . 2009 ) , the fe abundance of the reflector or absorber is considered to be 0.71.3 solar .",
    "when estimating the @xmath12 by fitting the spectra with the model c , we fixed the fe abundance to 1 solar .",
    "however , if we set the fe abundance to 2 or 0.5 solar , the @xmath12 systematically changes by a factor of up to 0.83 or 1.03 , respectively .",
    "considering that the relation between @xmath12 and ew is almost linear around @xmath37 @xmath1 ( ghisellini et al .",
    "1994 ; ikeda et al .",
    "2009 ) , the abundance ratio of fe to other heavy metals , such as o , ne , si , and s , is indicated to be close to 0.71.3 solar . figure [ nhabun ] shows an fe abundance of the absorber and reflector obtained by fitting the spectra with the model a. in this case , the fe abundance is determined by the relative strength of the fe - k edge and the reflection hump around 20 kev , as demonstrated by reeves et al . ( 2007 ) . the fe abundance is well determined to be 0.81.5 solar for mildly compton - thick objects with the average and variance 1.18 and 0.21 solar , respectively , for objects with @xmath38 @xmath1 .",
    "this value is consistent with the estimation from the relation between the fe - k line ew and @xmath12 .",
    "however , several objects deviate from this clear relation .",
    "swift j0601,9 - 8636 , ngc 2273 , and ngc 4968 show a very large ew of @xmath39 kev for @xmath40 @xmath1 .",
    "swift j0601,9 - 8636 is that reported in ueda et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , who suggested that this agn is more buried in the geometrically thick torus than is typical , whereupon a large solid angle of the torus would enhance the fe line .",
    "awaki et al .",
    "( 2009 ) reported that the suzaku spectrum of ngc 2273 contains a significant fraction of the reflection component around the 6.4 line and their sophisticated spectral modeling reveals a higher @xmath12 of @xmath41 @xmath1 . meaning that the @xmath12 obtained by simple modeling might be underestimated",
    "this situation also applies for ngc 4968 , the spectrum of which resembles that of ngc 2273 .",
    "some seyfert 1 agns with @xmath42 @xmath1 show a relatively large ew of @xmath43 ev , but this is due to the time variability of the continuum level ; good examples of which are ngc 3227 and ngc 5548 which were observed with suzaku several times and with the largest ew in the faintest continuum level .",
    "note that no objects exist for which the 6.4 kev line intensity varied among several suzaku observations ( table 1 ) .",
    "on the other hand , certain objects exist with a negligible ew of the 6.4 kev line .",
    "the upper limits of ew in table 1 are obtained by fixing the center energy and width to 6.4 kev and 30 ev , respectively .",
    "high x - ray luminosity objects exhibit a smaller ew of mostly @xmath44 ev , and some in particular as low as @xmath45 ev ( igr j21247 + 5058 , 1h 0419 - 577 , 3c 273 , ark 564 , pds 456 , ton_s180 ) .",
    "this trend of the baldwin effect ( iwasawa and taniguchi 1993 ) is clearly seen in figure [ fe64 ] , and suzaku also found a clear trend for the first time even for seyfert 2 galaxies by accurately measuring the luminosity of the direct component above 10 kev .",
    "note that the sample used contains broad line radio galaxies ( 3c 120 , 3c 390.3 , 3c 445 , 3c 382 , 3c 33 , 3c 452 , 3c 104 ) with an x - ray luminosity of @xmath46 erg s@xmath10 ( 1050 kev ) .",
    "apart from the high luminosity objects , low luminosity objects with luminosity of @xmath47 erg s@xmath10 also show a low ew , such as m 81 and m 106 ( yamada et al . 2009 ) .",
    "these objects with a high or low luminosity are considered to have a reflector with a smaller solid angle from the central engine by a factor of @xmath48 than typical seyfert galaxies . except for the above specific situations",
    ", there are no extraordinary objects , deviating from the clear ew-@xmath12 relation .",
    "an fe - k edge feature around 7.15 kev reveals additional information about the neutral iron , together with the 6.4 kev line .",
    "the edge energy is more sensitive to the ionization state than the fluorescence line energy ( makishima 1986 ; kallman et al .",
    "2004 ) , and the observed energy is plotted against the edge depth @xmath24 in figure [ edge ] for objects with small error bars , which reveals observed edge energy of around 7.2@xmath490.1 kev and an indicated ionization state of @xmath50 .",
    "limited to @xmath51 , the edge energy is determined to be below 7.2 kev , tightly constraining the ionization state to @xmath52 for compton thicker objects .",
    "note that there is a hint of a higher edge energy for lower @xmath24 objects .",
    "the average edge energy is 7.204@xmath490.022 and 7.110@xmath490.033 kev for objects with @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "the energy of the compton - thicker objects is consistent with that for the neutral fe - k edge of 7.112 kev ( x - ray transition energy database ) , while the energy of seyfert 1 galaxies indicates the weak ionization state of 37 or the contribution of the disk / absorption line .",
    "line ew and edge depth @xmath24 should suggest a linear correlation if the absorber and reflector have the same column density , ionization degree , and iron abundance , following @xmath55 .",
    "figure [ tau64ew ] shows the plot between an edge depth and a 6.4 kev line ew .",
    "both values correlate relatively well , indicating identical origin , while some outliers exist at an edge depth of 0.20.5 and a high ew of @xmath56 ev .",
    "these objects are almost compton - thick ( such as ngc 4945 ) , the spectrum of which is dominated by the reflection component .",
    "therefore , the deviation is due to the fact that for these objects , the edge is mainly caused by reflection , whereas for other compton - thinner objects , it is mainly caused by absorption .",
    "the @xmath24 scatter for low ew objects is due to the origin of the absorption differing from that of the reflection as described in the discussion .",
    "another possibility is being affected by a disk line or weak unresolved lines around their shallow edge structure .",
    "thanks to the unprecedented signal - to - noise ratio of the suzaku data for many agns , it is revealed that ionized emission and absorption lines with equivalent widths of 560 and 540 ev , respectively , are very common for seyfert galaxies , regardless of whether type 1 or 2 objects .",
    "this is in good agreement with the results for compton - thin objects , based on the xmm - newton data ( bianchi et al .",
    "figure [ fe6770 ] shows the relation of ews between 6.7 and 7.0 kev lines . here ,",
    "although the line intensities correlate well with each other , some deviating objects do exist  some objects showing either a 6.7 kev emission line or a 7.0 kev absorption line ( mrk 766 , ngc 7582 ) .",
    "swift j1628.1 + 514 shows a 6.7 kev absorption line and a 7.0 kev emission line .",
    "the strongest emission lines are seen for compton - thick seyfert 2 galaxies ( ngc 1068 , ngc 4945 , mrk 273 , circinus galaxy , and iras 19254 - 7245 ) . for ngc 1068 and ngc 4945",
    ", the 6.7 kev line is strong but the 7.0 kev line less so .",
    "conversely , relatively strong absorption lines are seen for ngc 1365 , whose ews of 6.7 and 7.0 kev absorption lines are around 100 ev .",
    "in contrast with the 6.4 kev line , ngc 3227 , ngc 5548 , and mrk 766 show a variability of ionized fe - k lines , in such a way that the absorption line at 6.7 kev appeared with increasing flux over a time scale of @xmath57 days .",
    "such variability also emerged for ngc 3783 by xmm - newton ( reeves et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "figure [ fe6770nh ] shows a plot of an equivalent width of 6.7 and 7.0 kev lines against an absorption column density of cold material .",
    "seyfert 1 galaxies show a smaller ew of @xmath58 ev for both emission and absorption lines , while compton - thick objects show a large ew for the emission lines ; sometimes @xmath59 ev , with the trend for the emission line resembling that of the 6.4 kev line ; the ew is almost constant below @xmath34 @xmath1 but increases rapidly above @xmath34 @xmath1 , indicating that the geometrical distribution of highly ionized material is similar to that of the neutral one but the covering solid angle is around 10% of the cold material .",
    "this trend is not seen for the absorption line , but a relatively large ew tends to be observed for objects with larger @xmath12 .",
    "figure [ fe6770lx ] shows a plot of an equivalent width of 6.7 and 7.0 kev lines against an x - ray luminosity ( 1050 kev ) . there is a trend of smaller equivalent width for higher x - ray luminosity .",
    "an average of the absolute value of ew , which is taken for objects whose line is significant at 1.5@xmath15 level as shown in table 1 , is 22 and 11 ev below and above @xmath60 erg s@xmath10 , respectively , for the 6.7 kev line .",
    "the average for the 7.0 kev line is 24 and 10 ev below and above @xmath60 erg s@xmath10 , respectively .",
    "correlation coefficients are calculated at -0.37 and -0.43 for the 6.7 and 7.0 kev lines , respectively , in comparison with -0.39 for the 6.4 kev line .",
    "therefore , the coefficients are almost comparable to that of the 6.4 kev line which shows a clear baldwin effect , despite the significant errors of the 6.7 and 7.0 kev lines .",
    "this is the first hint of the baldwin effect for ionized fe - k lines .",
    "these correlations suggest that the physical properties of the ionized material are related with the neutral material and the nuclear luminosity .",
    "tne center energy of the 6.4 kev line and the fe - k edge strongly constrain the ionization states of the absorber / reflector to less than 12 and 6 , respectively .",
    "this is the most severe constraint to date , thanks to the suzaku capability .",
    "the latter corresponds to the ionization parameter of @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the luminosity of the central engine , @xmath63 the matter density , and @xmath20 the distance to the matter ( kallman et al .",
    "the width of the 6.4 kev line is constrained to @xmath30 km s@xmath10 or @xmath6470 ev for objects with well - determined values , suggesting that the origin of the 6.4 kev line is a broad - line region or a torus .",
    "the line equivalent width and the edge depth correlate well with each other , indicating that both features are due to the same origin .",
    "therefore , considering the above constraint of @xmath65 and the column density @xmath66 , the 6.4 kev line likely comes from the neutral matter at @xmath67 pc away from the nucleus , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 represent the luminosity and column density in units of @xmath70 erg s@xmath10 and @xmath71 @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the reduced time variability of the 6.4 kev line is also consistent with this picture . since the inner torus radius is reported at 0.03@xmath72 pc ( suganuma et al .",
    "2006 ) , the reflection matter is not the outer disk but the torus .",
    "the absorption column density reportedly varied rapidly within one day ( e.g. elvis et al .2004 ) or several weeks ( risaliti et al .",
    "although the blob - like structures of the compton - thick absorber could cause such short - term variability , the phenomena could also be attributable to the underlying reflection component , even if only the direct nuclear component varies .",
    "therefore , the fast time variability of the absorption column density must be focused on by carefully considering the reflection component .",
    "seyfert 1 galaxies and compton - thin seyfert 2 galaxies with @xmath73 @xmath1 show a similar ew of 50120 ev for the 6.4 kev line , regardless of the absorption column density . by simple estimation , a reflection component has an ew of @xmath741000 ev for 1 solar abundance , @xmath75 @xmath1 , and the input powerlaw photon index of 2 . considering the transmission and reflection efficiency of the reflector with a solid angle of @xmath76 and a column density of @xmath12 , the sum of the direct and reflection components reveals an fe - k ew of @xmath77 ev .",
    "therefore , a compton - thin absorber can not create the observed large ew of 50120 ev , and the compton - thick reflector with @xmath8 @xmath1 should exist around the nucleus at the off line of sight even for seyfert 1 galaxies , with possible candidates including accretion disk or dust torus ( awaki et al .",
    "1991 ; guainazzi et al .",
    "since the constraint of the ionization state of reflectors requires the location of @xmath78 pc from the nucleus , the reflector for seyfert 1 galaxies is not the disk but the torus .",

    "1994 ; ikeda et al .",
    "2009 ) . as discussed in ghisellini et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , the reflection by the inner disk also contributes to the ew by 100150 ev ( matt et al .",
    "however , various ionization states , doppler , and relativistic effects would smear the fe - k line features , meaning that the fe - k line from the inner disk is not single nor narrow .",
    "a clear correlation between the column density and the 6.4 kev line ew indicates that the torus is an absorber with a large solid angle and that the torus column density varies within the range @xmath2 @xmath1 on an object by object basis .",
    "large ews of 6.4 kev at @xmath11 @xmath1 mean that the reflection material differs from the absorber .",
    "therefore , the absorber below 10@xmath0 @xmath1 is not a torus , but a low column material toward the off - torus direction . in the case of @xmath81 @xmath1 , the low ionization state of @xmath82 constrains the distance of the absorber to @xmath83 kpc for luminosity of @xmath70 erg s@xmath10 .",
    "therefore , the matter is likely to be part of the interstellar medium ( matt 2000 ; guainazzi et al . 2005 ) .",
    "based on the broadband x - ray spectroscopy , it has been reported that the relative reflection component for seyfert 2 galaxies is larger than that of seyfert 1 galaxies ( malizia et al .",
    "2003 ) . however , there is no trend of higher ew for larger column density below @xmath84 @xmath1 . above @xmath84 @xmath1 ,",
    "the correlation between the ew and column density constrains the solid angle to @xmath85 , comparing the relation obtained by the simulation ( ghisellini et al .",
    "1994 ; ikeda et al .",
    "this is not different from @xmath79 of seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "figure [ nh64pofl ] shows the 6.4 kev line intensity ratio against the flux in 1050 kev , which corresponds to the emission efficiency of the 6.4 kev line against the direct nuclear emission , since the observed flux in 1050 kev is almost equivalent to the flux of the direct nuclear emission , as described in  3 .",
    "therefore , this ratio is not significantly affected by the absorption like the equivalent width and is calculated as @xmath86 erg@xmath10 for the photon index of 1.52.2 , a solid angle of @xmath87 , a reflector column density of @xmath88 @xmath1 , fe abundance of @xmath891 solar , fe - k fluorescence yield of 0.34 , and a k@xmath7 fraction of 0.88 . the observed ratio is almost within the range @xmath90 erg@xmath10 for various absorption column densities , suggesting that the 6.4 kev emitter has a geometrical structure with @xmath91 commonly for many seyfert galaxies , and that no clear difference exists between seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies .",
    "some compton - thick objects exhibit a large ratio above @xmath92 erg@xmath10 ; circinus galaxy , ngc 1068 , ngc 2273 , ngc 4968 , eso 323-g032 , and swift j0601.9 - 8636 , indicating that no direct nuclear emission is observed even above 10 kev , namely , that they are reflection - dominated .",
    "another possibility is that the solid angle of torus is exceptionally large as suggested for swift j0601.9 - 8636 ( ueda et al .",
    "the ratio of ngc 4945 is @xmath93 erg@xmath10 for @xmath25 cm @xmath94 .",
    "when correcting the absorption , the flux becomes 1.5 times higher , and the ratio is reduced to @xmath95 erg@xmath10 , which is consistent with the suggestion that ngc 4945 has a small solid angle of torus ( itoh et al .",
    "this plot is therefore very useful to consider the torus solid angle and distinguish whether or not the continuum is reflection - dominated .",
    "the relation between the absorption column density and the ew of the 6.4 kev line , together with the ratio of the fe - k edge depth and the reflection hump around 20 kev , indicates that the fe abundance of the reflector and absorber is around 0.71.3 solar .",
    "detailed spectral modeling of the suzaku spectrum of the compton - thick mrk 3 , based on the simulation , is almost consistent with 1 solar abundance ( ikeda et al .",
    "for the compton - thick ngc 1068 , the fe abundance was reported to be 24 solar , based on detailed analysis of the neutral and ionized fe - k lines ( matt et al .",
    "2004 ; bianchi et al .",
    "an enhanced starburst activity of ngc 1068 would cause an overabundance ( bruhweiler et al .",
    "1991 ) , but this is an open issue .      in most cases , the ew of the ionized fe - k emission lines is 550 ev . referring to the k@xmath7 fluorescence",
    "yield @xmath740.7 of fe@xmath96 ( krolik & kallman 1987 ) , the ew of the emission line due to fluorescence of the ionized material , which is not so compton - thick , becomes @xmath97 ev , where @xmath98 is the photoelectric optical depth of the ionized matter .",
    "resonance scattering by the material outside the line of sight could become the dominant source of the emission line in the optical - thin regime ( @xmath991 ) ( matt et al .",
    "1994 ) . therefore ,",
    "both fluorescence and resonance scattering contribute to the fe - k emission lines , but the fluorescence dominates for higher column density . bianchi and matt ( 2002 ) calculated the ew of ionized fe - k lines from both fluorescence and resonance scattering , and their results indicate that the observed ew of 550 ev requires a column density of @xmath100 @xmath1 . in their geometry , the solid angle of the ionized material is @xmath101 .",
    "about 30% of objects exhibit an ionized emission line at 1.5@xmath15 level ( 90% confidence level ) , indicating that the ionized material of the above column density subtends about 30% of @xmath102 , which resembles the situation in bianchi and matt ( 2002 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the ew of ionized fe - k absorption lines is often 5 - 40 ev .",
    "chandra hetg observations of some seyfert galaxies reported the width of fe - k absorption lines to be around several 1000 km s@xmath10 ( kaspi et al .",
    "2002 ; risaliti et al .",
    "according to the growth curve of the fe - k absorption lines ( bianchi et al .",
    "2005 ) , the column density @xmath12 of the absorption matter toward the line of sight is @xmath103 @xmath1 , corresponding to @xmath104 . which suggests that the emission and absorption lines are both due to the same matter .",
    "no compton - thick objects exhibit absorption lines , which is attributable to the significant reduction in the direct nuclear emission transmitting the ionized material around the fe - k lines and the domination of the reprocessed component .    the ionization parameter @xmath105 is considered to be @xmath106 . therefore , taking @xmath107 erg s@xmath10 , the distance @xmath20 from the nucleus to the ionized matter is constrained to @xmath108 cm .",
    "this is consistent with a time scale showing variability of the fe - k absorption lines of around several weeks for ngc 5548 and ngc 3227 . assuming @xmath81 @xmath1 , the density is @xmath109 @xmath110 and while the highly ionized matter is located at the broad line region , its density is much lower and the ionization state much higher than the broad - line - emitting cloud .    some compton - thick objects , such as ngc 1068 , ngc 4945 , circinus galaxy , and iras 19254 - 7245 , exhibit strong 6.7 and/or 7.0 kev emission lines with ew@xmath59 ev .",
    "in these cases , the ionized material should subtend a large solid angle of @xmath111 .",
    "if the ionized matter emitting the emission line is the same as that causing the absorption line , the column density is @xmath112 @xmath1 whereupon the @xmath76 becomes comparable to or exceeds @xmath102 in most cases .",
    "therefore , the material emitting ionized fe - k lines for these objects differs from that of compton - thinner objects .",
    "assuming column density of @xmath113 @xmath1 and an ionization parameter of @xmath114 , the distance from the nucleus is constrained to be @xmath115 cm . in the case of ngc 4945 and circinus galaxy with @xmath116 erg s@xmath10 ,",
    "@xmath20 becomes @xmath117 cm or @xmath118 light day or @xmath119 of the black hole schwarzschild radius with a mass of @xmath120 m@xmath121 .",
    "the maser emission for these objects indicates that the inclination of the disk is nearly edge - on .",
    "therefore , the outer disk region appears to be somewhat vertically extended and highly photo - ionized , with nuclear emission visible through this region .",
    "these parameters resemble those of the ionized matter of fe - k absorption lines for ngc 1365 with 10 times higher luminosity , but it exhibits a blue shift of 5001500 km s@xmath10 .",
    "the rapid increase of ew of the ionized fe - k emission lines at @xmath8 @xmath1 indicates that the column density of the ionized material increases alongside that of the cold material .",
    "this situation is explained by the partial photoionization of the outer disk region .",
    "high luminosity agns are shown to systematically exhibit a smaller ew for the 6.4 kev line and also possibly for the 6.7 and 7.0 kev lines . in the sample",
    "used , high luminosity agns include radio - quiet quasars , narrow - line seyfert galaxies , and broad - line radio galaxies .",
    "this trend is seen even when seyfert 2 galaxies are excluded , which show a smaller @xmath12 for higher luminosity ( e.g. ueda et al . 2003 ) .",
    "these indicate that both of neutral material ( torus ) and ionized matter are severely irradiated by the bright nucleus and a significant portion of the material becomes fully ionized and evaporated .",
    "this trend of the 6.4 kev line for seyfert 2 galaxies matches the deficiency of compton - thick objects for higher luminosity .",
    "somewhat higher fe - k edge energy for agns with lower absorption column density suggests that the inner part of torus begins to be photoionized .",
    "low luminosity agns also show a smaller ew of the 6.4 kev line , but the ionized fe - k line is not weak .",
    "it is suggested that advection - dominated accretion flow is formed when the accretion rate is much smaller than the eddington limit ( narayan & yi 1994 , chiaberge et al .",
    "2006 ) . in this case",
    ", the torus which supplies accretion material is considered smaller , and the low - density accretion flow is photoionized .",
    "these observational features for ionized fe - k lines can be compared with the inner radius of dust torus against the agn optical luminosity ( suganuma et al .",
    "2006 ) , where light travel time @xmath122 from the nucleus to the inner radii of the torus is proportional to the square of luminosity as @xmath123 .",
    "when the luminosity exceeds several @xmath9 erg s@xmath10 , the inner region of the dust torus evaporates and its inner radius becomes as large as 100 light days . also , highly ionized material , which exists at a smaller radius than the torus , is fully ionized , whereupon emission or absorption lines can not be observed .",
    "this picture matches the tendency of lower cold absorption column density for high luminosity agns ( e.g. ueda et al . 2003 ) .",
    "furthermore the higher the luminosity of the radiation , the greater the propensity for massive outflow to occur , as observed in some high luminosity agns .",
    "the luminosity - dependence of these properties , regardless the black hole mass scatter by two orders of magnitude , indicates that the torus is related to the structure of the parent galaxy rather than the central black hole .",
    "we systematically analyzed the fe - k line features of 88 seyfert galaxies with high - quality suzaku data , and derived the properties of matter around the nucleus .",
    "based on the constraint of the ionization state and the relation among ew , column density , and edge depth , neutral matter causing a 6.4 kev line and 7.1 kev edge is likely to be the torus with a solid angle of typically @xmath4 and an fe abundance of 0.71.3 solar for both seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies , but certain high or low luminosity objects require a very small solid angle of torus , possibly due to the small amount of accreting material or the significant photo - ionization of the torus .",
    "no systematic difference emerges between seyfert 1 and 2 in terms of properties .",
    "we propose a new measurement value which is useful to consider the above issues ; the 6.4 kev line intensity ratio against the 1050 kev flux .",
    "highly ionized fe - k lines are found for 2030% of seyfert galaxies .",
    "their ionization state and ew are consistent with the picture that highly ionized matter is located at the broad line region and they exists with a much lower density than the broad - line - emitter .",
    "a large ew of he - like fe - k lines for certain compton - thick objects indicates the contribution of the photoionized outer disk as viewed edge - on .    in the near future ,",
    "high - resolution x - ray spectroscopy by micro calorimeter will become available , which will allow the nuclear region to be probed more precisely by an order of magnitude than by current x - ray ccd observations .",
    "compton shoulder of the neutral fe - k line and line width are powerful parameters to constrain the location and geometry of neutral matter .",
    "precise measurements of the line and edge features , including satellite lines , reveal information concerning the chemical state of the matter , which thus allows us to probe the dust state .",
    "the fine structure of the ionized emission or absorption lines is also a strong tool to constrain the matter density and precisely determine the ionization state , while the line profile and center energy are important to derive information of matter velocity .",
    "such measurements are currently performed for only a few objects by long - look chandra heteg observations .",
    "disk line features can also be unambiguously tested , since their features can be separated from other fe - k line and edge features .",
    "astro - h sxs is the first to perform such measurements for many agns and furthermore track their time variation .",
    "the authors wish to thank all members of the suzaku science working group , for their contributions to the instrument preparation , spacecraft operation , software development , and in - orbit calibration .",

    "<S> an absorber with a lower column density of @xmath5 @xmath1 for compton - thin seyfert 2 galaxies is suggested to be not a torus but an interstellar medium . </S>",

    "<S> the rapid increase in ew of the ionized fe - k emission lines at @xmath8 @xmath1 indicates that the column density of the ionized material also increases together with that of the cold material . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that these features seem to change for brighter objects with more than several @xmath9 erg s@xmath10 such that the fe - k line features become weak . </S>",

    "<S> the luminosity - dependence of these properties , regardless of the scatter of black hole mass by two orders of magnitudes , indicates that the ionized material is associated with the structure of the parent galaxy rather than the outflow from the nucleus . </S>"
