    "experimental investigations has elucidated on the complex dynamics of the low to high ( l  h ) plasma confinement mode transition .",

    "furthermore , periodic modulation of flow and turbulence level with the characteristic limit cycle oscillation at the gam frequency was present @xcite .",
    "the gams are weakly damped by landau resonances and moreover this damping effect is weaker at the edge suggesting that gams are more prominent in the region where transport barriers are expected @xcite .    during recent years investigations on coherent structures such as vortices , streamers and zonal flows",

    "zonal flows impede transport by shear decorrelation @xcite , whereas the gam is the oscillatory counterpart of the zonal flow ( @xmath2 in the potential perturbation , @xmath5 , @xmath6 in the perturbations in density , temperature and parallel velocity ) and thus a weaker effect on turbulence is expected @xcite .    the electron temperature gradient ( etg ) mode driven by a combination of electron temperature gradients and field line curvature effects is a likely candidate for driving electron heat transport @xcite .",
    "the etg driven electron heat transport is determined by short scale fluctuations that do not influence ion heat transport and is largely unaffected by the large scale flows stabilizing ion - temperature - gradient ( itg ) modes .",
    "the generation of large scale modes such as zonal flows and gams is here realized through the wave kinetic equation ( wke ) analysis that is based on the coupling of the micro - scale turbulence with the gam through the wke under the assumptions that there is a large separation of scales in space and time .",

    "@xcite it is found that saturation produced by secondary modes occurs at long wavelengths causing significant streamer dominated transport , suggestive of a high saturation level for the etg mode such as that found in this paper .",
    "it is interesting to note that in simulations , damping of the gam due to coupling to higher @xmath3 modes has been found  @xcite .",
    "it is evident that using the wave kinetic equation such damping would inevitably be found by allowing the energy to be distributed among several modes .",
    "it is well known that linear drift wave can be significantly damped by finite @xmath0 effects and it was recently shown that finite @xmath0 can have a significant impact on secondarily generated modes such as zonal flows  @xcite .",

    "the finite @xmath0-effects are added in an analogous way compared to the recent work on zonal flows in ref .",
    "in particular the maxwell stress is included in the generation of the el - gam .",
    "the frequency of the el - gam is higher compared to the ion gam by the square root of the ion - to - electron mass ratio ( @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the real frequencies of the electron and ion gams , respectively . ) .",
    "it is found that similar to the linear growth rate the finite @xmath0 effects are stabilizing the gam using a mode coupling saturation level . furthermore , increasing the non - adiabaticity parameter ( @xmath10 ) can decrease the growth rate through a linear contribution . finally , the effect of enhanced non - linear saturation level found in @xcite on the gam growth would lead to a correspondingly increased gam growth rate .",

    "( [ eq:4.14 ] ) modified by the neoclassical damping in stationary state @xmath166 and @xmath167 . in steady state we find the saturation level for the etg turbulent intensity as ( @xmath168 ) @xmath169 here , the saturation level is modified by the neoclassical damping @xmath170 and the @xmath171 factor arises due to the spatial extension of the gam and we obtain @xmath172 note that this is significantly larger than the mixing length estimate with @xmath173 . in this estimation",
    "we have used values of the parameters relevant for an experimental edge plasma such that @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 , @xmath178 , @xmath179 where @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "in this work the electromagnetic effects on the electron geodesic acoustic mode ( el - gam ) are investigated .",
    "the work extends a previous study ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) by self - consistently including linear as well as non - linear @xmath0 effects in the derivation .",
    "the linear dispersion relation of the el - gam is purely oscillatory with a frequency @xmath182 whereas the gam growth rate is estimated by a non - linear treatment based on the wave - kinetic approach .",
    "the el - gam growth rate is driven by a competition between the reynolds stress and the maxwell stress .",
    "the non - linear dispersion relation is solved numerically where it is found that the magnetic safety factor @xmath93 has a stabilizing effect on the el - gam .",
    "however the quantitative results are strongly dependent on the other physical parameters while the finite @xmath0-effects are moderate .",
    "the effect of the maxwell stress on the el - gam growth rate can be significant and the gam can be stabilized for increasing @xmath0 . moreover , for an increasing amount of impurity ions ( increasing @xmath154 ) , the @xmath0 effects become increasingly important .",
    "note that , in the dispersion relation a set - off non - linear drive is present below which the el - gam is stable .    to estimate the etg mode fluctuation level and gam growth ,",
    "a predator - prey model was used to describe the coupling between the gams and small scale etg turbulence .",
    "the stationary point of the coupled system implies that the etg turbulent saturation level @xmath159 can be drastically enhanced by the new saturation mechanism , stemming from a balance between the landau damping and the gam growth rate .",
    "this may result in highly elevated particle and electron heat transport , relevant for the edge pedestal region of h - mode plasmas .",
