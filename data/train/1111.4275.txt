    "the nature of dark matter and dark energy is one of the most important issues today in physics",
    ". there are strong observational evidences in astrophysics and cosmology for the existence of these two components of the cosmic energy budget , indicating that about @xmath7 of the universe is composed by dark matter ( about @xmath8 ) and by dark energy ( about @xmath9 ) , but no direct detection has been reported until now .",
    "the usual candidates * for * dark matter ( neutralinos and axions , for example ) and dark energy ( cosmological constant , quintessence , etc . ) lead to very robust scenarios , but at same time they must face theoretical and observational issues . for recent reviews on the subject ,",
    "see for example @xcite .",
    "the strongest issue is perhaps the one regarding dark energy as the vacuum expectation value of some quantum field , which would be a natural candidate , but whose correct theoretical value could be predicted only in the framework of a complete theory of quantum gravity , which still we do not possess . nevertheless , it is possible , at least , to guess some of the features of this theory .",
    "in particular , the holographic principle @xcite may shed some light on the dark energy problem . according to this principle , in presence of gravity the number of the degrees of freedom of a local quantum system",
    "would be related to the area of its boundary , rather than to the volume of the system ( as expected when gravity is absent ) . following this *",
    "idea * , in @xcite the authors suggested an entanglement relation between the infrared and ultraviolet * cutoffs * due to the limitation set by the formation of a black hole , which sets an upper bound for the vacuum energy .",
    "we can then interpret the ultraviolet cutoff as the vacuum density value , but still we need an ansatz for the infrared cutoff . as a candidate for such distance ,",
    "in @xcite the authors propose and investigate the future event horizon , tested against type ia supernovae data and cosmic microwave background anisotropies in @xcite .",
    "we shall present more detail on this in sec .  [",
    "sec : holde ] .",
    "adding new components of dark energy to the whole energy budget in order to explain the current observation is a way , but not the only one .",
    "since general relativity has been thoroughly tested up to solar system scales , it may be possible that the einstein - hilbert action contain corrections on larger , cosmological , scales thereby candidating as possible explanation of the evolution of the universe .",
    "such modifications should be , in principle , composed by higher order curvature invariant terms ( such as @xmath10 , @xmath11 , etc ) but also by non - trivial coupling between matter or fields and geometry .",
    "see for example @xcite for some reviews on the subject ( especially on @xmath6 theory ) .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that these terms should naturally emerge as quantum corrections in the low energy effective action of quantum gravity or string theory @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we connect these two approaches , considering a @xmath0 theory of gravity , where @xmath1 is the ricci scalar , whereas @xmath2 is the trace of the stress - energy momentum .",
    "this modified gravity theory has been recently introduced in @xcite , where the authors derived the field equations and considered several cases , relevant in cosmology and astrophysics . as for the former",
    ", @xmath0 models have been constructed describing the transition from the matter dominated phase to the late times accelerated one @xcite .",
    "our task here , is to find out which form the function @xmath0 has to have in order to reproduce the same properties of the holographic dark energy proposed in @xcite . to this purpose",
    ", we employ the same reconstruction scheme proposed and employed in @xcite . for reference , in order to track the contribution of the @xmath2 part of the action in the reconstruction , we consider two special @xmath0 models : in the first instance , we investigate the modification @xmath3 , i.e. the usual einstein - hilbert term plus a @xmath4 correction . in the second instance",
    "we consider a @xmath5 theory , i.e. a @xmath2 correction to the renown @xmath6 gravity . in both cases , we consider dark energy accompanied by a pressureless matter component ( which would determine @xmath2 ) .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : holde ] , the equations of motion are established and the holographic dark energy introduced . in sec .",
    "[ sec : simpl ] and [ sec : complcase ] the above mentioned cases are analysed .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : discconcl ] is devoted to discussion and conclusions .",
    "we use @xmath12 units and adopt the metric formalism , i.e. * the variation of the action is considered with respect to the metric quantities . *",
    "in @xcite , the following modification of * einstein s * theory is proposed : @xmath13 where @xmath0 is an arbitrary function of the ricci scalar @xmath1 and of the trace @xmath2 of the energy - momentum tensor , defined as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the matter lagrangian density .",
    "we assume the matter lagrangian to depend on the metric , so that @xmath16 varying action with respect to the metric @xmath17 , one obtains @xcite @xmath18 where the * subscripts * @xmath1 or @xmath2 * imply * derivation with respect that quantity and we have also defined @xmath19 * planning * a cosmological application , we assume matter to be described by a perfect fluid energy - momentum tensor @xmath20 and that @xmath21 , so that we have @xmath22 and eq .",
    "simplifies as @xmath23 in order to compare * it * with * einstein s * , we cast the above equation as follows : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the einstein tensor .",
    "now we can identify @xmath26 as the _ effective _ matter energy - momentum tensor and @xmath27 as the energy - momentum tensor of a `` geometric '' matter component .",
    "we now assume a * background * described by the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker metric @xmath28 with spatially flat hypersurfaces , and find a form for the function @xmath0 which is able to reconstruct * holographic dark energy*.      according to the holographic principle @xcite an entanglement relation between the infrared ( ir ) and ultraviolet ( uv ) cut - offs of a quantum theory , due to the limitation set by the formation of a black hole , sets an upper bound for the vacuum energy @xcite : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a free parameter and the ir ( large scales ) cutoff @xmath31 needs to be specified by an ansatz .",
    "we are interested in the one proposed in @xcite : @xmath32 i.e. the future event horizon , that is the distance covered by a photon from now until the remote future .",
    "note that the very presence of a vacuum energy component makes the above integration finite .",
    "we consider a model composed by holographic dark energy plus ordinary pressureless matter , i.e. @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the hubble parameter and the dot denotes derivation with respect to the cosmic time .",
    "introduce the critical energy density @xmath35 * * , we define * * @xmath36 using eqs . and , it is easy to show that @xmath37 the holographic dark energy density @xmath38 evolves according to the conservation law @xmath39 because in eq .",
    "we have implicitly assumed the matter component to conserve separately .",
    "now , using eqs .  , and , one can find @xmath40 comparing with one can read off @xmath41 moreover , combining eq .",
    "with eqs .   and , the evolution for @xmath42 is determined by the following equation : @xmath43 where the prime denotes derivation with respect to the redshift @xmath44 .",
    "testing this model against type ia supernovae and cosmic microwave background anisotropies , @xmath30 turns out to be constrained around unity , with the case @xmath45 favoured @xcite .",
    "note that , from eq .",
    ", @xmath45 means that the universe will end up in a phantom phase . for more comprehensive analysis of holographic dark energy models ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "in the next section we investigate a simple case of reconstruction of @xmath0 .",
    "we now consider a single perfect fluid model with density @xmath46 and pressure @xmath47 , together with the following ansatz ( one of the first considered in @xcite ) : @xmath48 i.e. the action is given by the same einstein - hilbert one plus a function of @xmath2 .",
    "this is a particularly interesting choice since , from eqs .   and",
    ", we get @xmath49 for @xmath50 one has @xmath51 and , choosing @xmath52 one can construct a model with an effective cosmological constant @xcite . from eq .   one can read off the effective energy density and pressure of the universe content : @xmath53 and therefore a dark energy component may appear , even if we are considering a single perfect fluid model . from eqs .   and",
    ", it is clear that we can pick out a `` fictitious '' component , due to @xmath4 , described by @xmath54 and , provided @xmath55 positive , it may well describe a dark energy component , since its pressure is negative . in order to reconstruct the function @xmath55 starting from the holographic principle",
    ", we note that the equation of state parameter of the dark component induced by @xmath55 is @xmath56 and we identify it with @xmath57 , the one provided by the holographic dark energy in eq .",
    ": @xmath58 for the standard model given in eq .  , consider the fluid component to be pressureless matter , i.e. @xmath50 .",
    "we are left to solve the following system of equations : @xmath59 where we have used @xmath51 , because we are considering pressureless matter . in order to solve the above system",
    ", we have to fix some initial conditions . clearly , @xmath60 , and we choose @xmath61 , accordingly with current cosmological observation . for the initial condition on @xmath55 , from eq .",

    "the actual difference among the various choices of @xmath30 takes place at late times , for small values of @xmath46 . again from inspection of eq .",
    ", we can see that for large values of @xmath30 the linear evolution @xmath71 is again solution .",
    "that is why in the left panel of the curve seems to `` straighten up '' for increasing @xmath30 .    in",

    "we now turn our discussion on a more general case , where the curvature @xmath1 * comes into * the action * as * a function to be determined .",

    "we expect this solution to be the only one , otherwise there would exist an alternative @xmath6 theory which would behave exactly as general relativity .",
