    "second , the mixing angles and masses are still bearing too broad uncertainties to analyze the fluxes , and moreover the fluxes to be detected at telescopes are significantly sensitive to mixing angles .",

    "<S> neutrino fluxes at telescopes depend on both initial fluxes out of astronomical bursts and flavor mixing during their travel to the earth . however , since the information on the initial composition requires better precision in mixing angles and vice versa , the neutrino detection at telescopes for itself can not provide solutions to the both problems . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a probability to be measured at long baseline oscillation is considered as a complement to the telescope , and problems like source identification and parameter degeneracy are examined under a few assumptions . </S>"
