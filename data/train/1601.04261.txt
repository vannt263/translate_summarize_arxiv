    "nonequilibrium thermal fluctuations for a small system in contact with heat bath in equilibrium become very large and exhibit interesting properties that are universal over different systems .",
    "the underlying principle for the universal properties is the fluctuation theorem ( ft ) , which was first discovered for a deterministic system thermostatted so as to conserve kinetic energy  @xcite .",
    "the ft was later proven to hold for a wide class of stochastic systems  @xcite .",
    "it deals with the thermal fluctuations of thermodynamic quantities produced persistently in time , such as work and heat in a nonequilibrium process . a typical form of the ft is given by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the rate of work production piled over a period @xmath2 in nonequilibrium dynamics driven by a nonconservative force acting on the system initially prepared in equilibrium with heat bath .",
    "@xmath3 is the inverse temperature @xmath4 for the boltzmann constant @xmath5 and the temperature @xmath6 of the heat bath .",
    "the bracket denotes the average over all possible fluctuations . to investigate the ft and related issues , it is required to accurately deal with the probability distribution of the thermal fluctuations in a nonequilibrium process .",
    "work and heat are path - dependent quantities . the thermal fluctuations of such quantities arise from many different paths ( trajectories ) along which the system evolves in time .",
    "one essentially needs the ensemble average over all paths from the past to the present , unlike the usual ensemble average over all states at a certain time .",
    "the path integral theory to deal with trajectory - dependent fluctuations was developed by onsager and mathlup based on the langevin equation  @xcite , and was used successfully to prove the ft  @xcite .    in the experimental side ,",
    "the fluctuations around the average value of a thermodynamic quantity for a small system become so predominant that they are measurable with high accuracy by using modern technologies .",
    "interesting experiments were carried out to confirm the ft for various systems such as a colloidal particle in a moving optical trap  @xcite , a molecule in the afm pulled by an external force  @xcite , an electrical circuit driven by a small current  @xcite , a harmonic oscillator under an external force  @xcite , an rna molecule unfolded and refolded by optical tweezers  @xcite , a rotating motor protein @xmath7-atpase  @xcite , and a colloidal particle in breathing harmonic potential  @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach to the study on large fluctuations for a small system is molecular dynamics ( md ) .",

    "it plays the role of the bridge between experiment and phenomenological theory such as the langevin dynamics . the first md study in this field",
    "was carried out accompanying an experiment for a colloidal particle in a moving optical trap  @xcite .",
    "recently , md studies were done to confirm the ft for non - equilibrium motions such as the effusion of an ideal gas through a hole between two compartments  @xcite and the motion of a particle in a moving billiard  @xcite .    in our work",
