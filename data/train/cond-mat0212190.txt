    "despite many years of research the mysterious properties of underdoped high - temperature superconductors remain an unsolved and most challenging problem of strongly correlated electron physics .",
    "recent theoretical proposals as well as experimental data trace the possible origin of the unconventional electronic properties of underdoped cuprates to a delicate competition between various types of ordering phenomena .",
    "since metallic cuprates result from doping mott - hubbard antiferromagnetic insulators , it is natural that strong magnetic correlations persist for superconducting compositions but alternative ordering tendencies may be hidden as well .",
    "the relation between superconductivity and antiferromagnetism and the attempt to treat both types of order on the same footing was the basis of the phenomenological so(5 ) theory as originally proposed by zhang @xcite .",
    "yet , the observation of inhomogeneous charge and spin structures in static stripe patterns in rare - earth doped la@xmath7sr@xmath8cuo@xmath9 @xcite and the appearance of an anisotropic @xmath5-wave like pseudogap at temperatures well above the superconducting transition have pointed to the possibility of nearby instabilities towards other phases in competition or coexistence with @xmath5-wave superconductivity .",
    "the relevance of stripe patterns was proposed early on ( for a review see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and years later their existence was indeed experimentally verified in la@xmath10nd@xmath11sr@xmath8cuo@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "these static stripe structures may in fact result from the lattice anisotropy connected to the cuo@xmath12 octahedral tilt pattern in the ltt phase of this compound@xcite .",
    "time - reversal symmetry breaking charge - flux ( cf ) @xcite and spin - flux ( sf , spin nematic ) @xcite phases were also proposed early on as possible ground states of the basic correlated electron hamiltonians commonly used to model high - t@xmath13 superconductors .",
    "the idea of circulating orbital currents ( also called an orbital antiferromagnet state@xcite ) was recently revived as the underlying origin of the pseudogap phase in underdoped cuprates@xcite .",
    "two variants of orbital current structures are currently discussed : varma @xcite proposed a circulating current pattern in the cuo@xmath14 planes which preserves the discrete translational symmetry of the lattice , while the more recently proposed @xmath5-density wave ( ddw ) state @xcite contains a staggered current pattern which doubles the unit cell .",
    "the latter state is in fact equivalent to the orbital antiferromagnet discussed a long time ago@xcite .",
    "these time reversal symmetry breaking phases may furthermore coexist with @xmath5-wave superconductivity .",
    "yet , another instability connected to the spontaneous deformation of the fermi surface ( pomeranchuk instability , pi ) was recently proposed for the two - dimensional hubbard model@xcite .",
    "it appears tempting to suggest a possible relation between the pomeranchuk instability and stripe pattern formation .",
    "remarkably , the possible existence of orbital currents has most recently received experimental support .",
    "angular - resolved photoemission with circularly polarized light identified intensity differences for left and right circularly polarized photons below the pseudogap temperature in bi2212 @xcite and c - axis oriented ordered magnetic moments were detected by spin - polarized neutron scattering in ybco @xcite .",
    "both data sets can find a natural interpretation in terms of planar circulating current phases .",
    "the tendency towards the formation of charge flux phases is most likely beyond the physics of the standard hubbard model . in order to allow for a larger variety of competing or coexisting phases it appears therefore demanding to explore some extensions of the hubbard model .",
    "a natural choice is to consider the extended @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 hubbard model ( @xmath1 is a nearest - neighbor interaction and @xmath2 is the heisenberg exchange coupling ) .",
    "this model was chosen early on to study orbital antiferromagnetism and spin nematic phases . in one dimension ( 1d ) , this model was studied within the bosonization technique @xcite . however , in 1d , one can not explore the possibility of charge- and spin - flux phases , but they were later on investigated in an extension to ladder systems@xcite . in two dimensions ,",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 model was considered within mean - field approximation for @xmath15 @xcite and for @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the possible coexistence of antiferromagnetism and @xmath5-wave superconductivity@xcite , and charge flux and @xmath5-wave superconductivity @xcite was discussed in this context .",
    "more recently , the possibility of coexisting phases was reanalyzed within a mean - field treatment of the extended hubbard model which furthermore includes correlated hopping @xcite",
    ".    common to these studies is the need to go beyond the standard one - band hubbard model to allow for a variety of alternative ordering phenomena .",
    "however , a mean - field treatment does not allow for an accurate treatment of fluctuations which may alter the complex ground - state phase diagram .",
    "other analytical and numerical methods are needed for a reliable insight into the interplay of various types of ordering tendencies .",
    "one possible step forward in this direction has been the recent analysis of competing phases within dynamical mean - field theory @xcite .",
    "another possible route is to start from the weak - coupling regime , where magnetic or superconducting instabilities can result from nesting of the fermi surface ( fs ) or van hove singularities ( vhs ) in the density of states .",
    "the latter case is also relevant from a material oriented point of view since the fs of cuprates in an intermediate doping regime is close to vhs of the electron spectrum@xcite .",
    "schulz considered @xcite different phases near van hove band fillings within a mean - field - like analysis which , however , did not take into account the interplay of different electron scattering channels .",
    "the parquet approach was first applied to the extended hubbard model with a nearest - neighbor hopping in refs .",
    "@xcite , where besides the standard superconducting , spin- and charge - density - wave instabilities , the possibilities for spin- and charge - flux instabilities were also discussed .",
    "recently , the standard hubbard model ( @xmath17 ) was investigated within the renormalization - group ( rg ) approach on a patched fs using the polchinsky flow equations @xcite , wick - ordered rg equations @xcite , and a rg scheme for one - particle irreducible functions @xcite .",
    "the possibility of the charge - flux phase as well as the pomeranchuk instability for the standard hubbard model was addressed in ref .",
    "these latter methods have the advantage that they allow to take into account the contributions of the entire fs . at the same time ,",
    "even the restriction of the momenta to the vicinity of van hove points ( the so called `` two - patch '' approach originally proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite ) can capture already the essential physics and can give results which are in qualitative agreement with the rg approaches on patched fermi surfaces , see ref .",
    "this two - patch approach allows to include the contribution of particle - hole scattering at small momenta which is expected to be important for the determination of the complete ground - state phase diagram .",
    "the role of this type of scattering was also explored within the rg approach with a temperature cutoff on the patched fs @xcite . although the phase diagram of the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 hubbard model was investigated previously within the two - patch rg approach , only the cases of @xmath15 @xcite and arbitrary @xmath2 with nearest - neighbor hopping dispersion@xcite , but without the contribution of the small - momenta particle - hole scattering were considered .",
    "the same model within the many - patch approach was not systematically studied so far .    in this paper",
    "we reconsider the phase diagram of the extended @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 hubbard model with special emphasis on the possibility of flux phases@xmath18 we employ the mean - field approximation , two- and many - patch rg approaches .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "ii we start with the mean - field phase diagram of the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 hubbard model . in sect .",

    "iv we complement the rg analysis by symmetry arguments . finally , in sect .",
    "v we summarize the main results and conclude .",
    "we consider the extended @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 hubbard model on a square lattice as given by @xmath19 where the hopping amplitude @xmath20 for nearest neighbor sites @xmath21 and @xmath22 and @xmath23 for next - nearest neighbor sites ( @xmath24 ) ; @xmath25 is the total number of electrons .",

    "we decouple the interactions by introducing the order parameters @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) , and arrive at the mean - field hamiltonian @xmath46 where @xmath47 @xmath48 are the fourier transforms of the operators in eq .",

    "for the ferromagnetic phase the mean - field equations read @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the fermi function .",
    "non - trivial mean - field solutions exist only for @xmath63 which therefore determines the borders of absolute stability of the corresponding phases in the phase diagram .",
    "we also allow for coexistence of antiferromagnetism , @xmath5-wave superconductivity , and charge - flux phases .",
    "the corresponding mf equations are the generalization of those for the coexistence of sdw and dsc phases @xcite and cf and dsc phases @xcite , and have the form @xmath64 where the electronic spectrum is given by @xmath65 we note that a nonzero expectation value of both , antiferromagnetic and superconducting order parameters , produces also a nonzero @xmath66-triplet pairing amplitude with momentum @xmath67 ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) .",
    "analogously nonzero values of charge flux and @xmath5-wave superconducting order parameters lead to a finite singlet pairing amplitude with momentum @xmath67 ( so called @xmath68-pairing ) . here",
    ", we do not include @xmath66- and @xmath68-pairing in the mean - field analysis , since it was verified numerically@xcite that the corresponding amplitudes are significantly smaller than the amplitudes of the corresponding `` parent '' order parameters .",

    "since the regions of stability of different phases overlap , we compare the energies @xmath74 to identify the mean - field ground state . the resulting phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "1 . at positive @xmath2 and not too large @xmath1",
    "we find coexistence of a spin density wave with @xmath5-wave superconductivity .",

    "therefore , this transition as well as the transition from the sdw into the sdw+dsc phase is of second order .",
    "all other phase boundary lines in fig . 1 correspond to first order transitions .",

    "the coexistence region of the sdw+dsc phase is replaced by a pure sdw state .",

    "( [ kx ] ) , implies a divergent isothermal compressibility @xmath254 a divergence of @xmath89 can be attributed generally to different phenomena : a metal - insulator transition @xcite or phase separation . in the considered parameter region",
    "the most natural explanation is phase separation induced by a large negative @xmath255 for large enough @xmath242 @xmath256 we obtain the ferromagnetic state ( f ) with the coupling constant flow @xmath257 ; for large positive @xmath1 @xmath258 is the most diverging susceptibility .",

    "the dashed area corresponds to the frustrated regime where the critical value of the scaling parameter @xmath260 and the spin - density - wave instability is strongly suppressed by negative @xmath261 such behavior arises from the competition between antiferromagnetic and superconducting fluctuations on one side and ferromagnetic fluctuations on the other side . as a result different types of instabilities almost `` cancel '' each other .",
    "four other phases ( sdw , dsc , cf and pi ) have the same flow of the coupling constants ( @xmath262 ) .",
    "the magnitudes of the susceptibilities @xmath263 @xmath264 @xmath265 in the region @xmath4 are close to each other ( see fig .",
    "7b ) , which naturally implies a close competition between these states . with increasing @xmath2",
    "we find a pi phase where the susceptibility @xmath248 is largest .",
    "however , this instability also always appears outside of the weak - coupling region of the phase diagram where the equations ( [ twopatch ] ) are valid .    as in the mean - field solution ,",
    "away from half filling one expects phase separation or the formation of inhomogeneous structures of all ordered phases with wavevector @xmath67 ( cdw , sdw , cf and sf ) .",
    "note however , that this filling - induced type of phase separation should be contrasted with the interaction - induced phase separation in the ps region of the phase diagram , which is present even at half - filling ( @xmath85 ) and may not be magnetically ordered or superconducting .",
    "the results of the many - patch approach are shown by different symbols , explained in the figure captions .",
    "solid symbols correspond to different types of ordering tendencies .",
    "open symbols correspond to frustrated behavior , where the many - patch rg could not reach @xmath266 for @xmath267 boundaries between some phases ( e.g. cdw and sf , dsc and ps for @xmath4 ) almost coincide in the two- and many - patch approaches . at the same time , the many - patch approach predicts a much broader region of stability for the sdw phase and an almost vanishing region of stability for the cf phase .",
    "therefore , for @xmath85 and @xmath268 taking into account more patches on the fs ( and therefore the contribution of nested parts ) moves the predicted phase boundaries closer to those of the mean - field results . at the same time , the charge flux , as well as the @xmath5-wave superconducting response in the many - patch approach are substantial within the antiferromagnetic phase , which implies a close competition between the above ordering tendencies . for a rough estimate , where the charge response is closest to the antiferromagnetic one , we bound the region with @xmath269 @xmath270 by thin crosses .    at @xmath6 many - patch approach",
    "does confirm the possibility of a spin flux phase in almost the same parameter region as determined from the two - patch approach .",
    "with decreasing @xmath1 this spin flux phase is however replaced by a ( partially frustrated ) ferromagnetic phase , which fills most of the region where the frustrated sdw order was expected in the two - patch approach .",

    "similarly , at @xmath6 decreasing @xmath0 shifts the balance between sf phase and ferromagnetism towards the spin - flux phase . other phases ( e.g. cdw and ps ) are essentially not influenced by varying @xmath271    when increasing @xmath272 up to @xmath273 the phase diagram changes ( see fig .",
    "6 ) . in the two - patch approach , at @xmath274 @xmath5-wave superconductivity becomes the leading instability . for large positive @xmath1",

    "6 ) or cdw and pi instabilities ( cdw@xmath250 phase ) depending on @xmath2 . for large negative @xmath275",
    "we again find interaction - induced phase separation .",
    "most of the region with @xmath276 and moderate @xmath277 is frustrated ( @xmath260 ) , which is again the result of a strong competition of different ordering tendencies .",
    "the many - patch approach also gives the strongest tendency to @xmath5-wave superconductivity at @xmath278 but the tendency towards ferromagnetic order in a large part of the frustrated region @xmath276 .",
    "similar to @xmath279 and @xmath71 at @xmath280 the @xmath5-wave superconducting region for @xmath6 predicted by the two - patch approach is replaced by phase separation in the many - patch approach .",
    "the boundary of the cdw phase also almost coincides for the many - patch and two - patch approach .",
    "therefore , at @xmath273 the predictions of the two - patch approach are closer to the results of the many - patch approach , than for smaller @xmath281 .",
    "this is connected with the absence of nested parts of the fermi surface , as discussed above .",
    "in summary , the rg analysis gives a much richer phase diagram than anticipated from the mean - field results of the previous section . at the same time , for small @xmath272 the results of the many - patch rg approach , which takes into account the contributions of the whole fs and therefore treats the renormalization of the interactions in a more accurate way , are closer to the mean - field predictions than the results of the two - patch approach . at intermediate @xmath272",
    "the two - patch approach becomes more reliable and the results of both approaches are close . in the next section we supplement the above rg studies by an @xmath282 symmetry analysis .",
    "additional insight to the phase diagram is obtained by considering the symmetries of the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) with respect to the @xmath282 symmetry group of transformations of the @xmath283-fermion states @xmath284 and @xmath285 ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) .",

    "@xcite , the operator @xmath294 performs a rotation between sdw and dsc states ( which is the basis of the @xmath295 theory @xcite ) , the operator @xmath296 between dsc and cf states , the operator @xmath297 between sdw and cf phases as well as cdw and sf phases while the operator @xmath298 rotates between sdw and sf phases and between cdw and cf phases , respectively .",
    "the symmetry of the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) under these operations is as follows .",
    "the non - interacting part of the hamiltonian is invariant ( @xmath299 ) under the rotations @xmath297 and @xmath298 and in the nesting case @xmath300 under @xmath301 and @xmath302 the interaction is invariant only under the rotations @xmath303 for @xmath304 i.e. the hubbard model , which was originally discovered by yang and zhang @xcite but the interaction is not invariant with respect to the other rotation operations .",
    "the symmetry of the restricted two - patch hamiltonian ( [ hvh ] ) is considerably higher@xcite . for this restricted hamiltonian",
    "the interaction part , and therefore the entire hamiltonian at half - filling and zero @xmath305 is invariant with respect to the operations @xmath306 or @xmath298 on special lines in the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane ( at fixed @xmath307 ) .",
    "the corresponding lines are supplied by captions in fig .",
    "4 , corresponding to the type of the symmetry .",
    "the symmetry lines exactly coincide with the boundaries between different phases in the two - patch approach , since the corresponding susceptibilities @xmath308 in this approach are identical on these lines for arbitrary @xmath124 . at the same time , as we have seen in section iii , most of these symmetries ( those which are connected with the sdw order ) are broken by the contribution of the nested parts of fs . away from half - filling or at finite @xmath272 the non - interacting part of the hamiltonian becomes invariant only with respect to the rotations @xmath297 and @xmath298 .    to get more insight into the posibility of different ordering tendencies , we rewrite the hamiltonian in terms of the operators of the @xmath286 algebra .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the contribution of the vh points , since the corresponding analysis for the whole fs becomes very complicated and requires numerical diagonalization of the corresponding hamiltonian . taking into account that the non - interacting part of the hamiltonian ( [ hvh ] ) for vh points , i.e. @xmath309  vanishes at the vh filling ( where @xmath310 ) , the hamiltonian is rewritten as @xmath311 where @xmath312 and @xmath191 ... @xmath192 are the vertices determined in the two - patch approach ( sect .",
    "these vertices can be also considered as those obtained from the many - patch analysis for the corresponding momenta , provided that the contribution of electrons with momenta far from the vh singularities is small , i.e. @xmath84 is not close to zero@xmath18 under these conditions , the hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) can be considered as an effective hamiltonian of the rg procedure in the previous section , which acts on the space of @xmath313 states @xmath314 where @xmath315 or @xmath316 denotes the electron states with vh momenta @xmath105 or @xmath106 .",
    "first we consider the eigenstates @xmath317 of the operators @xmath318 which are easily expressed in terms of the states @xmath314 and we obtain the expectation values of the hamiltonian in the corresponding states as @xmath319 where @xmath320 is independent of @xmath321 and @xmath322 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ gg ] ) . therefore the states which were identified in the two - patch approach as having the largest susceptibility ( largest @xmath323 for @xmath193 ) have also the lowest effective energy among the eigenstates @xmath317 .    for @xmath324 or @xmath325 the eigenstates @xmath317 of the operators @xmath289 are not the eigenstates of the effective hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) , since the operators @xmath289 generally do not commute with this hamiltonian .",
    "to find the eigenstates of the hamiltonian , we represent it as a matrix with respect to the states @xmath326 are not mixed by the operators of the @xmath286 algebra and we can consider them separately . in the following ,",
    "we focus on the even subspace where the interaction part of the hamiltonian is non - trivial .",
    "the resulting energy levels and the eigenfunctions are presented in table 1 .",

    "the other states  are not eigenvectors of any operator in eqs .",
    "( [ o ] ) and ( [ op1 ] ) .",
    "considering the flow of the energy levels of the respective states which are given as a function of the coupling constants @xmath333 in the second column of table 1 , we obtain the correspondence between the lowest energy eigenstates of the effective hamiltonian in the two - patch rg procedure and the phases identified in sect .",
    "we find that in the f and sf phases the triplet @xmath334 has the lowest energy .",
    "it is natural to associate the states @xmath335 which have eigenvalues @xmath336 of the operator @xmath337 with the ferromagnetic phase and the state @xmath338 with the sf phase .",
    "similarly , in the ps phase the states @xmath339 , in the cdw and a phases the state @xmath340 and in the cdw@xmath250 phase the state @xmath341 have the lowest energies . finally , the @xmath342 state is common for sdw , cf , dsc , and pi instabilities , i.e. phases which have the coupling constants flow of ( @xmath262 ) type .",
    "the resulting correspondence is presented in the right column of table 1 .    to clarify possible types of orders which correspond to the eigenstates latexmath:[$%    eigenstates in terms of the eigenvectors @xmath317 of the operators @xmath344 by calculating the scalar products @xmath345 listed in table 2 .",
    "generally the states @xmath346 are a mixture of the states which correspond to different order parameters .",
    "so , the state @xmath347 and @xmath68 types of order .",
    "the state @xmath341 ( identified with the cdw@xmath250 phase ) mixes cdw , pi , and sf types of order .",
    "the state @xmath348 which is connected with the ps phase is also a mixture of dsc and @xmath68 pairing .",
    "finally the @xmath342 state mixes sdw , dsc , cf , and pi types of order in complete agreement with the results for the susceptibilities in the two - patch approach .    although we do not analyze in this section the contribution of the whole fs , one can expect that general features learned from the simple two - patch analysis hold in this case too .",
    "namely , we expect that the eigenstates of the whole hamiltonian do not coincide with the eigenstates of operators , corresponding to different order parameters .",
    "although the eigenvectors of the effective hamiltonian corresponding to the contribution of the whole fs have a much more complicated form , we expect that the combinations of the order parameters listed in table 2 which belong to the _ same _ eigenstate remain unchanged .",
    "this can be also seen from the analysis of simultaneously diverging susceptibilities in the many - patch approach . at the same time",
    ", one can not safely argue whether or not the discussed states support the coexistence of long - range orders , or whether part of the abovementioned orders are only short - range . resolving these possibilities",
    "requires a strong - coupling analysis of the problem which is beyond the validity of one - loop renormalization - group approach .",
    "we considered the phase diagrams of the extended @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 hubbard model within mean - field approximation and from rg approaches .",
    "the extended hubbard model has a very complex phase diagram with various types of orders .",
    "the mean - field approximation provides only a rough phase diagram of the system . at positive @xmath2",
    "it leads mainly to the coexistence of antiferromagnetism with a small amplitude of @xmath5-wave superconductivity . at negative @xmath2 mean - field theory",
    "predicts ferromagnetic order . for large enough positive @xmath1",
    "these phases are replaced by cdw order , while for large negative @xmath1 the ground state is a @xmath5-wave superconductor .",
    "charge- and spin- flux phases , as well as their coexistence with @xmath5-wave superconductivity are never energetically stable within the mean - field approximation .",
    "the rg analyses at van hove band fillings leads to substantially reacher phase diagrams ( figs .",
    "instabilities towards sdw , cdw , dsc , cf , sf , f order are possible in different parameter regimes .",
    "importantly , for @xmath349 and not too large @xmath277 sdw , cf , dsc orders have comparable susceptibilities , which signals their close competition in this parameter region .",
    "at the same time , the tendency towards the formation of charge - flux is greatly suppressed in the many - patch approach in comparison with the two - patch results , and it becomes the leading instability only in the restricted parameter range . with increasing @xmath350",
    "the @xmath5-wave superconducting state becomes more preferable .",
    "tendencies towards both spin - independent and spin - dependent pomeranchuk instabilities are outside of the weak - coupling region of the phase diagrams where the rg analysis is applicable .",
    "the symmetry analysis shows that most of the phases obtained within the rg approach are in fact a mixture of long- or short - range orders of different types .",
    "resolving between short- and long - range orders for these phases requires a strong - coupling analysis of the problem which can not be performed within the rg approach .    comparing the obtained results with the phase diagram of the 1d version of the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 hubbard model @xcite",
    ", we observe that the phase diagram of 1d model is similar to the results of the two - patch approach at half - filling .",
    "charge- and spin - flux phases replace the staggered bond - order - wave phase of the 1d model .",
    "the cdw , cdw@xmath250 phases appear in two dimensions in the same parameter region as the cdw phase in the 1d case . for @xmath4",
    "the sdw phase of the 1d system is partially substituted by @xmath5-wave superconductivity . at the same time , the results of two - patch approach are strongly changed at half filling by the contribution of the whole fermi surface and become closer to the mean - field phase diagram , rather than to 1d results .    the physically most relevant regime of the 2d @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 hubbard model is contained in the parameter range @xmath351 @xmath352 .",
    "the corresponding areas are shaded in figs .",
    "4 - 6 . with decreasing van hove filling we observe the following qualitative changes in the shaded area of the phase diagram :",
    "at half - filling sdw order dominates . for small doping @xmath353",
    ", we encounter a very complicated situation , in which sdw , charge - flux and @xmath354-wave superconductivity ordering tendencies are all simultaneously strong , although sdw order still dominates . in this regime",
    "the ground state structure is very sensitive to small parameter changes leading to a variety of possible phase transitions and the possibility for coexisting phases .",
    "finally , at larger doping @xmath355 the picture becomes simpler again and only @xmath5-wave superconductivity becomes the leading instability .    under the abovementioned circumstances of strong competition of different order parameters ,",
    "the self - energy effects which are not accounted for in the one - loop rg approach can become crucial .",
    "therefore , for a final conclusion about the possibility of a charge - flux phase in a broad parameter range of the one - band @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 model , the analysis of the two - loop contributions to the rg schemes remains to be performed .",
