    "recently a proposal of qcd investigation at high density and low temperature , complementary to the heavy nuclear collisions , was suggested @xcite .",
    "the proposal is based on the fact that a large number of nucleons in the interaction region is not necessary for the phase transition to occur , and only a change of the vacuum state should be initiated by some experimental environment . in particular , observation of multi - baryons",
    "( mb ) may be a direct evidence of phase transitions in small nucleon systems .",
    "separation of a mb mass from the secondary particle background is feasible if the mb decay width is narrow enough . that requires the excitation energy of mb produced should be low .",
    "for this purpose , it is reasonable to select only those experimental events in which the mb creation is accompanied with a high momentum particle , taking away an essential part of the energy from the interaction region",
    " method of cumulative particle @xcite . in this paper , we focus on a verification of this concept by the use of older experimental data taken at jinr synchrophasotron .",
    "an experiment @xcite was designed for measurement of cross - sections of pp- , nd- , and dd - interactions at 8.9 gev momentum of primary protons and deuterons . a model of the detector operation",
    "was briefly described in @xcite .",
    "its parameters were established by means of measuring differential elastic cross - sections for proton - proton scattering in a known kinematic region .",
    "three peaks were observed in the spectrum of the missing masses of the reaction d@xmath1d@xmath2m@xmath3d at @xmath4 gev@xmath5 .",
    "here we shall concentrate only on one of them , called the third peak in the original paper . in regard to the third peak , m.a .",
    "baldin et al suggested that it might occur due to : a contribution of an excited state of deuteron ; scattering of a constituent quark ( entering into the composition of the incident deuteron ) by target deuteron ; and , in addition , n@xmath6-baryon production .",
    "experimental findings occurred after the paper @xcite was written give a cause for re - examination of the suggestions mentioned above .",
    "the present paper might be considered as a particular proposal for experimental search of phase transitions in small nucleon systems .",
    "elastic scattering of a constituent quark by the target deuteron may be considered in the framework of a model in which values of momentum and mass of the projectile quark are considered in the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is determined from kinematics of the reaction . a necessary relation between quark mass and known experimental parameters",
    "can be found as follows .",
    "let us denote by 1 + 2 @xmath2 3 + 4 a reaction at issue , where the projectile , target and registered particles are designated by 1 , 2 and 4 , correspondingly , and 3 denotes an object x which mass should be determined .",
    "two different expressions for the lorentz invariant mandelstam variable @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , allow to connect @xmath13 and @xmath14 which describs the escape direction of the particle 4 in the laboratory system . a value energy of particle 4 as function of @xmath15 and @xmath16 may be found by making use of a relation @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , @xmath18 . proceeding on this way , one obtains @xmath19 and @xmath20 gev for @xmath21 .",
    "this number contradicts manifestly to estimations of modern quark models : see , e.g. , @xcite where @xmath22 gev . on the other hand , we shall see below that a peak at @xmath21 corresponds remarkably to the dibaryon found by wasa - at - cosy collaboration @xcite .",
    "now let us turn to study of a possible contribution of @xmath24 reactions to the experimental cross - section .",
    "isotopic spin conservation constrains isospin of @xmath0 to be equal to 1/2 .",
    "therefore , @xmath25baryon excitations of nucleon may be ignored here , and among @xmath0 excitations only n(1440 ) , n(1520 ) and n(1535 ) are important in the kinematic region under consideration .",
    "main characteristics of the baryon resonances taken into account are shown in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "@xmath26 & @xmath27 , mev + n(1440 ) & @xmath28 & @xmath291 & 300 + n(1520 ) & @xmath30 & -1 & 115 + n(1535 ) & @xmath28 & -1 & 150 +    besides the spatial parity , @xmath31 , conservation , one should respect the angular momentum , @xmath32 , preservation . in @xmath33-approximation ,",
    "appropriate to the hard collisions , only @xmath34 and @xmath35 eigenvalues of the orbital momentum can be considered . in these terms ,",
    "parities of initial and final states may be expressed as follows : @xmath36    further pwa may be simplified essentially via application of the @xmath23 description of baryon excitations , suggested by r.h .",
    "dalitz and co - authors @xcite . according to it ,",
    "spin @xmath37 of a nucleon resonance @xmath0 may be represented as follows : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is spin of the unexcited nucleon @xmath40 and @xmath41 is orbital momentum of quarks inside of the excited nucleon @xmath0 . using ( [ parity ] )",
    ", it is readily seen that for each partial wave , which is characterized by fixed values of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , a value of parity @xmath26 of nucleon resonance @xmath0 determines totally a possible behavior of @xmath44 and @xmath45 values . for n(1440 ) , one has @xmath46 which implies @xmath47 , and , subject to ( [ parity ] ) , also @xmath48 . for n(1520 ) and n(1535 ) , @xmath49 ; therefore @xmath50 .",
    "according to ( [ spin ] ) and table  [ tab1 ] , we can interpret spins of n(1520 ) and n(1535 ) as two different manners of summation , using clebsch - gordan coefficients , of quark orbital momentum @xmath50 and initial spin @xmath51=1/2 of unexcited nucleon .",
    "the parity conservation leads to simultaneous change of @xmath45 and @xmath44 values in two possible ways : @xmath52 and @xmath53 in the frame of @xmath23 spectroscopy , these cases correspond to conservation of eigenvalues of operator @xmath54 , which are equal to 2 and 0 , accordingly .",
    "operator of the total orbital momentum @xmath55 commutes with @xmath56 , and we can develop a more detail picture including account of a direction of @xmath55 . below we shall consider centrally symmetric interaction conserving the direction of @xmath55 . in this case ,",
    "conservation of the total angular and orbital momenta implies preservation of the total spin , @xmath57 , of the system and our description admits a further development .    a general expression of the @xmath58 amplitude linear relative to @xmath51 , @xmath59 and invariant under time reversal and space rotation or reflection is as follows @xcite @xmath60 @xmath61 where @xmath62 @xmath63 and @xmath64 are momenta of the ingoing nucleon and outgoing n@xmath6 .",
    "here @xmath65 are scalar functions which may depend only on a scalar @xmath66 which is in one - to - one correspondence with @xmath67 .",
    "in fact , we should claim @xmath68 , for @xmath69 does not commute with @xmath70 and the corresponding term breaks conservation of an absolute value of the total spin . similarly , it is possible to show that @xmath71 .",
    "an identity @xmath72 holds true .",
    "the term @xmath73 in the parentheses preserves @xmath74 , the term @xmath75 commutes with @xmath76 , but does not with @xmath74 .",
    "this means that it conserves an absolute value of the total spin and breaks its direction .",
    "the term @xmath77 does not maintain a direction of @xmath78 and therefore a direction of @xmath79 or even an absolute value of the total spin .",
    "] because of the total spin conservation , a term proportional to @xmath80 is not included in ( [ ampg ] ) as far as it is proportional to unit operator for any state with a total spin @xmath81 fixed ( where , as usual , @xmath82 ) .",
    "efficiently , it is included in @xmath83 .",
    "thus , we have seen that the parity conservation admits concordant alteration of @xmath45 and @xmath44 according to ( [ swap ] ) and ( [ init ] ) . from the physical point of view ( [ swap ] ) corresponds to swapping external orbital momentum of n@xmath1d system into nucleon , and ( [ init ] ) corresponds to excitation of the both external , @xmath84 , and intranucleonic , @xmath41 , momenta .",
    "these processes may be described by a nonlocal operator @xmath85 included in the interaction amplitude . here",
    "@xmath86 is a polar vector given in the laboratory system , which is directed at center of inertia of n@xmath1d system , and @xmath87 is a polar vector pointed at center of mass of the nucleon colliding with deuteron . without loss of generality",
    ", we may also suggest @xmath88 .",
    "then @xmath89-matrix describing production of baryon from table  [ tab1 ] may be written in the form @xmath90 @xmath91.\\ ] ] here @xmath92 and @xmath93 describe spin independent and spin dependent parts of interaction corresponding to n(1440 ) production . similarly , @xmath94 and",
    "@xmath95 describe interaction corresponding to n(1520 ) and n(1535 ) . using an identity @xmath96 and well - known formulae for @xmath86 and @xmath87 operators @xcite @xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath99 @xmath100 it is possible to find that amplitudes of the processes ( [ swap ] ) and ( [ init ] ) are equal to @xmath101 and @xmath102 , accordingly .",
    "in fact , baryon resonances n(1440 ) , n(1520 ) and n(1535 ) were not observed directly . they were present in an intermediate state and",
    "may be identified only via their decay products .",
    "therefore interference terms corresponding simultaneous propagation of matter through several quantum states with different spins and parities should be taken into account .",
    "we take for granted that possible final states tolerating macroscopic recognition may contain n@xmath103 , n@xmath104 and n@xmath105 , of course , besides deuteron . for n(1440 ) and n(1520 ) , corresponding decay probabilities can be estimated as @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 ; and @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 for n(1535 ) , see @xcite .",
    "baryon resonances leave imprint of their existence only as propagators in total amplitude .",
    "for example , a transition n@xmath1d@xmath2n@xmath112d is described by the following @xmath89-matrix : @xmath113 @xmath114 @xmath115 @xmath116 analogous expressions take place for n@xmath1d@xmath2n@xmath117d and n@xmath1d@xmath2n@xmath118d transitions . in ( [ ampl ] )",
    ", scalar functions @xmath119 are the same as in ( [ t1 ] ) , and factors @xmath120 may be found on basis of clebsch - gordan coefficients , as it was mentioned in previous section . following this prescription , one can find @xmath121 @xmath122 and @xmath123 @xmath124 where we adopted notations of the clebsch - gordan coefficients from @xcite .",
    "here we should re - arrange a usual formula for cross - section @xcite , @xmath125 @xmath126 where @xmath127 and @xmath128 are spin projections of particles in initial and final states , into terms of our model of the orbital nucleon excitations .",
    "to this end , we replace averaging over @xmath129 and summation over @xmath128 by corresponding operation over @xmath130 and @xmath131 , which are total spin projections of _ quarks _ in initial and final states . for nonpolarized initial states , probabilities of occurrence of @xmath132 and @xmath133",
    "are equal to @xmath102 and @xmath134 , accordingly .",
    "taking into account that the contribution of orbital excitations is already included by means of @xmath135 , we may write : @xmath136 and then transform @xmath137 @xmath138 now it is easy to prove a relation @xmath139 which means that values of total spin @xmath132 and @xmath30 , as well as all its projections @xmath140 and @xmath141 , correspondingly , give equal contribution to the final result .",
    "it should be stressed that the sign @xmath142 of hermitian conjugation refers to @xmath89 as to spin operator , and it does not mean transposition of other variables .",
    "calculations of @xmath143 may be completed with making use of relations : @xmath144 @xmath145    absolute values of the decay amplitudes are fixed in terms of decay widths @xcite , @xmath146 where subscript @xmath0 denotes a particular baryon resonance , @xmath147 is its decay products .",
    "we confine our estimations of interference between different baryon resonances to operations with phase space averaged values . for this purpose ,",
    "we define @xmath148 and substitute ) is in the general case greater than the true one .",
    "therefore the role of interference is overestimated in our calculations .",
    "thus , we create an optimum for explanation of experimental data by interference between different nucleon excitations , as far as the resonances have too large widths to explain cross - section by themselves . ]",
    "@xmath149 for @xmath150 if @xmath13 is greater than @xmath0 decay threshold and zero otherwise .",
    "here baryon resonances are different , @xmath151 , and decay particles are the same for the both multipliers under integral sign .",
    "strictly speaking , separate control of spin projections of @xmath0 is not kept in mind in our description , but only projection of total spin of quarks in the final state of reaction n@xmath1d@xmath2n@xmath152d .",
    "therefore we should take into account availability of deuteron too and replace @xmath128 with @xmath131 and @xmath153 with @xmath81 in the previous formulae .",
    "such a treatment may be understood as summation over quark spin projections inside @xmath0 and spectator deuteron .",
    "contribution of orbital excitations into spin projection of @xmath0 is already included explicitly by means of @xmath154 , as it was mentioned above .",
    "this new interpretation of spin summation rule is an inevitable corollary of consideration of baryon as a compound system with its own inner structure .    in the accepted approximation ,",
    "only phases of the decay amplitudes @xmath155 may be used as adjustable parameters for experimental data matching .",
    "in addition , eight real numbers corresponding complex parameters @xmath156 in ( [ ampl ] ) are brought into play for this purpose .",
    "interference terms corresponding decays of @xmath0 via @xmath105 are absent since cross - sections of this channel are negligible quantities but for one of the resonances under consideration ( see values @xmath157 in beginning of this section ) .",
    "the final formula describing the experimental data may be written in the following form : @xmath158 @xmath159 where @xmath160 , @xmath161 and additional adjustable parameter @xmath162 describes a contribution of direct pion production near @xmath163 gev@xmath5 .",
    "to reach an optimum in describing the experimental data we minimized total deviation square for 22 experimental points from the theoretical curve .",
    "ten central experimental points , as the most important , were taken with unit weights and six ones on their left and six ones on their right were scaled with 0.5 significance .",
    "maple procedure nlpsolve for the local minimum search was used for optimal selection of theoretical parameters .",
    "several series , each containing 20 000 different sets of random initial values of parameters , were generated and only 30 percent of them were finished without interruption because of very big number of steps towards a local minimum .",
    "points of the interruptions were considered as local minima too , because they usually correspond to wanderings along valleys .",
    "then the best local minimum was taken for each of the series , and values of objective function corresponding to them were compared .",
    "they turned out to be equal within accuracy of 11 decimal digits .",
    "all the best local optima have demonstrated that experimental data demand unambiguously : @xmath164 of complex numbers @xmath92 and @xmath94 have no impact upon objective function .",
    "for removal of degeneration , we have fixed @xmath165 and introduced condition ( [ zeros ] ) explicitly into minimizing functional .",
    "now the normal mode of nlpsolve performance increased up to 55 percent signalling , nevertheless , that a large degeneration still persisted .",
    "three series of numerical experiments , containing 100 , 1000 and 20@xmath29000 events , with random selections of initial values of the remaining parameters were fulfilled .",
    "they showed that parameters @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath162 are identical in all the cases and are determined with accuracy of 4 and 6 decimal digits already in the series with 100 and 1000 events .",
    "however , all phases underwent rather strong changes with growth of statistics , signalling that minimizing functional remains degenerate with respect to them .",
    "thus , the optimization problem does not allow us to determine phases of parameters @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 , because many of their sets describe equally well the experimental data .",
    "a grade of fidelity of reproduction of the experimental data by this model may be seen in fig .  1 .",
    "we have also fulfilled evaluation of the model parameters using only 10 experimental points taken straight from the fine structure location , trying to enhance an impact of the most important region .",
    "it was technically fully regular procedure , as far as we had only 8 independent parameters at that stage .",
    "however , an agreement between theory and experiment has not been improved even in this case .",
    "numerical analysis fulfilled within the bounds of our model has revealed two nonobvious properties of hard n - d and d - d scattering .",
    "first of all , it was established that experimental data @xcite show strong spin dependence of n@xmath1d@xmath2n@xmath152d transition amplitude , see ( [ t1 ] ) with @xmath170 . secondly , comparison of the experimental data and theory shown in fig .",
    "1 makes an explicit hint of dibaryon production in this kinematic region .",
    "d@xmath2n@xmath152d reactions ( dashed line ) .",
    "the lower scale corresponds to the kinematics of reaction n@xmath1d@xmath2n@xmath152d , the top one describes reactions d@xmath1d@xmath2x@xmath1d , which implies the dibaryon production . a possible contribution of a dibaryon at 2.37 gev , @xmath171 mev reported by wasa - at - cosy collaboration @xcite into the cross - section is shown with the overturned solid line.,width=325 ]    indeed , on the one hand , consideration only usual nucleon excitations can not explain the fine structure shown in the figure .",
    "on the other hand , assumption about presence of a dibaryon at @xmath172 2.38 gev , @xmath173 70 mev , seen by wasa - at - cosy collaboration @xcite allows one to explain it very naturally .",
    "isospin conservation predicts certainly that reaction d@xmath1d @xmath2 dibaryon @xmath1 d should yield dibaryon with isospin @xmath174 , which also corresponds to the wasa - at - cosy result @xcite .",
    "thus , our consideration of the data on the hard deuteron - deuteron scattering @xcite meets the expectation to observe the transition of nucleon matter into other states using the method of cumulative particle which allows to recognize quasi - resonance peaks in the reaction cross - section .    to check our conclusions",
    ", it would be enough to measure with a good precision production cross - sections of n(1440 ) , n(1520 ) and n(1535 ) from n@xmath1d @xmath2 n@xmath175d reactions in appropriate kinematic region , and direct production of pions therein .",
    "this allows one to take into account the background .",
    "in addition , repeating experiment @xcite with higher accuracy is necessary too for unambiguous recognition of dibaryon by its mass and width .",
    "theoretical and experimental study of the phases entering into expression for production amplitude is ineffectual in this respect , so long as resultant cross - section is weakly dependent on them ( see previous section ) .",
    "investigation of decay products of dibaryon will make it possible to identify its spin and parity and compare with @xmath176 observed in @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to review ability of the lattice qcd to say something definite about existence of dibaryons .",
    "all lattice qcd collaborations have found stable nn - dibaryons and dibaryons containing s - quarks , but quark masses in their calculations are higher than the physical values , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "chiral extrapolations of these results to the physical point gave , however , evidences against the existence of such dibaryons , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "these calculations deal with ground states and say nothing about unstable states corresponding to a possibility of two - baryon fusion into 6-quark bag with a value of mass larger than a sum of masses of the initial baryons .",
    "recent progress in excited baryon spectroscopy is depicted in @xcite .",
    "corresponding results based on nonphysical quark masses too cover only one - baryon states so far and are in a poor agreement with experimental n and @xmath177 excitation spectra .",
    "the first excited state in two - nucleon system was found in lattice qcd in @xcite but with a heavy quark mass corresponding to @xmath178 gev .",
    "therefore , predicting quasi - bound states of a multibaryon systems remains a difficult challenge in lattice qcd till now .",
    "another important question : what is the reason that so few signs of dibaryons currently exist in spite of their search in the network of partial - wave analysis ? the most likely answer , as we see it , is still an unsatisfactory precision of pwa .",
    "indeed , incorporating the additional data of wasa - at - cosy collaboration into the said analysis produces a pole in support of the resonance hypothesis @xcite .",
    "a trivial generalization of the method of a cumulative particle is to select events with several , @xmath179 , secondary particles , not necessarily containing a cumulative one , which accompany a dibaryon production .",
    "such a group of the additional particles , e.g. , pions , may take away an excess of excitation energy , which put the main obstacle in the way of dibaryon recognition .",
    "in particular , yu.a .",
    "troyan reported the registration of some dibaryons using just this method @xcite it should be , however , noted that most of experimental searches of dibaryons carried out in the past must be exposed to requalification .",
    "let us consider , for example , a paper by b.m.abramov et al @xcite , which is cited sometimes as a convincing argument against one of yu.a .",
    "troyan s experiments .",
    "even gross inspection of that paper reveals the following grave shortcomings .",
    "firstly , no methods of a background substraction have been used .",
    "the solid line in the main figure of the paper @xcite is only an optimal approximation of the experimental invariant mass spectrum containing , in the general case , a sum of background and dibaryon contributions .",
    "secondly , number of events and precision of measurements do not allow to obtain a mass spectrum resolution nearly 1 mev , which is necessary to verify confidently the troyan results .",
    "thirdly , the conditions of `` deep cooling '' , which was ensured in troyan s experiments , has not been fulfilled in @xcite ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "all dibaryons reported in @xcite were observed in inelastic n - n interactions with additional secondary pions .",
    "the extra pions take away an excess of excitation energy  a process which is a some kind of annealing .",
    "this may reconcile two opposite requirements imposed simultaneously on the system : it must be strongly compressed to form a compound state and it must be cold enough , since highly excited levels are usually short - living and elusive . two additional pions in final state were in wasa - at - cosy and celsius / wasa collaborations experiments @xcite .",
    "therefore , we may suggest with high reliability that synthesis of new multibaryons , and particularly dibaryons , should succeed an observation made also for synthesis of new transuranium elements  the system must be as much cold as possible to be observable readily .",

    "<S> further experimental studies based on modern experimental facilities and more abundant statistics are necessary to verify these observations .    </S>",
