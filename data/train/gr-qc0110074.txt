    "in particular in this approximation , it is possible to discuss decay probabilities from one space - time to another one @xcite . for a certain class of gravitational backgrounds , namely the static spherically symmetric metrics , it could be interesting the use of other methods based on variational approach . in a series of papers ,",
    "we have used such an approach to show that a model of space - time foam@xcite can be concretely realized if one considers a collection of schwarzschild wormholes whose energy is given by casimir energy@xcite .",
    "we recall that the casimir energy procedure involves a subtraction procedure between zero point energies having the same boundary conditions . in this paper",
    "we compare the variational approach with the more traditional phase shift representation of the casimir energy .",
    "we will consider two types of static spherically symmetric wormholes : the schwarzschild wormhole and the reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) wormhole .",
    "the final energies will be compared showing that the casimir energy for rn wormholes is always higher than the casimir energy for the schwarzschild wormholes .",
    "this means that rn wormholes can not be taken as a representation of a ground state of a foamy space - time . to this purpose",
    "we will fix our attention on the following quantity @xmath8 @xmath9 representing the total energy computed to one - loop in a wormhole background .",
    "@xmath10 is the reference space energy which , in the case of the schwarzschild and rn wormhole , is flat space .",

    "the one - loop contribution can be composed , other than by a stable spectrum , even by an unstable spectrum .",
    "if the unstable spectrum is composed by exactly one element , we can invoke coleman arguments to conclude that we move from a false vacuum towards the true one like in the euclidean path integral formulation .",
    "nevertheless in the foam model , we know that the instability can be eliminated in the large @xmath13-wormhole approach as a wormhole packing consequence@xcite . thus to compare two different wormhole models of foam , it is sufficient to assume the existence of an unstable mode , which will be subsequently eliminated and compare only the stable spectrum . in particular , it is the following inequality @xmath14 that will be taken under examination",
