    "the first two molecular states @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the isosinglet and the isotriplet states of the @xmath7@xmath8 bound system@xcite .",
    "this binding requires a quark - spin hyperfine interaction in the over all @xmath9 @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath10 system .",
    "we will see that this binding is different from the particle exchange mechanisms that bind the rest of molecules of this report .",
    "the exchanges of ref.@xcite that bind the @xmath7@xmath8 system are quark exchanges where the quark - spin hyperfine interaction leads to an attractive potential .",
    "this attractive potential can only make states if the mesons of the fall apart mode @xmath9 @xmath10 - @xmath9 @xmath10 are below threshold .",
    "thus we have states of @xmath7@xmath8 lying just below threshold in scalar channel(@xmath11 ) .",
    "this is somewhat like the deuteron in the @xmath12 @xmath13 system .",
    "the work of ref.@xcite has one flaw with regards to long - range color van der waals - type forces@xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out that confining potentials of the type used in ref.@xcite leads to a long - range power - law residual potential between color singlets of @xmath14 between two mesons .",
    "ref.@xcite calculates the potential between mesons to be given by @xmath15 this is to be compared with the coulomb force between charged mesons @xmath16 the r in equation 1 and equation 2 is given in fm .",
    "let us compare the potential strength between them by setting them equal @xmath17 this occurs at the distance of 13.3 fm which is a very large distance .",
    "the size of the scalar bound states are much smaller 2 fm at best .",
    "this long range van der waals force implies that gluons are massless(like the photon ) and can travel to the edge of the universe in a virtual state(like photons in em - fields ) .",
    "gluons can only try to travel to the edge if they are in a color singlet state ( glueballs or glueloops ) .",
    "this would lead to an exponential cutoff @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the glueball mass .",
    "sine mesons are much lighter than glueballs , and the pion is the lightest , it is the longest carrier of the strong force .",
    "meson exchanges will be the binding force of the other hadron molecules of this report .",
    "the report is organized in the following manner :    sec .",
    "1 is the introduction to @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "2 looks at particle exchange calculations and the generation of @xmath2 .",
    "3 consider a dibaryon state @xmath3 and the similarity to @xmath2 .",
    "this similarity predicts the @xmath6 state .",
    "4 an exotic meson state @xmath20 which is seen in @xmath21 @xmath22 p - wave scattering @xmath4 is explained .",
    "5 predicts another molecular state @xmath5 which should be found .",
    "6 is the summary and discussion .",
    "in order to bind @xmath7@xmath8@xmath22 together , we need to develop a dynamical theory that uses particle exchange mechanism not the quark exchange that led to the van der walls forces@xcite .",
    "it is standard to break up the scattering of a three particle system into a sum of isobar spectator scatterings@xcite . to complete this task",
    "we develop a unitary isobar model which has long - range particle exchange forces .",
    "we will assume that the only interaction among the three particles are isobars decaying into two particles where one of these particle exchange with the spectator forming another isobar .",
    "this one - particle - exchange(ope ) occurs in the @xmath23@xmath8 , @xmath24@xmath7 and @xmath25@xmath22 isobar systems .",
    "see figure 1(a ) for the ope mechanism(note @xmath25 is the @xmath26 isobar which is its older name ) .",
    "we choose as our dynamical framework the blankenbecler - sugar formalism@xcite which yields set of coupled integral equations for amplitudes @xmath27 ) , @xmath28 ) , @xmath29 ) , @xmath30 ) , @xmath31 ) , @xmath32 ) , @xmath33 ) , @xmath34 ) , and @xmath35 ) .",
    "these amplitudes describe the isobar quasi - two - body processes @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , etc . , whose solution are lorentz invariant , and satisfy two- and three - body unitarity , and cluster properties . in operator formalism these equations have the structure(a schematic representation is show in figure 1(b ) ) , @xmath39 in equation 5 , @xmath40 is the overall c.m .",
    "energy of the three - particle system .",
    "the index @xmath41 which is summed over represent each isobar .",
    "integration is over solid angles where each total angular momentum is projected out as an individual set of coupled equations .",
    "momentum of the spectator which has the same magnitude as the isobar is integrated from zero to @xmath42 .",
    "thus all effective masses of isobars are probed starting at the kinematic limit down to negative @xmath42 .",
    "all details are given in ref.@xcite .",
    "@xmath43 is the propagator of isobar @xmath41 and @xmath40 determines the kinematic limit where c.m .",
    "momentum of the spectator and the isobar is zero . in figure 2",
    "we show the breit - wigner shape of the @xmath23 propagator @xmath44 as a function of isobar mass(@xmath45 ) . in figure 3",
    "we show the breit - wigner shape of the @xmath25 propagator @xmath46 as a function of isobar mass(@xmath47 ) .",
    "equation 5 can be rewriting as @xmath48 this fredholm integral equation leads to a fredholm determinant as a function of @xmath40 for each partial wave or total @xmath49 projection .",
    "we have solved this fredholm determinant for two @xmath50 states @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the results of this analysis is shown in figure 4 .",
    "we see no binding effect in the @xmath51 determinant , while in the @xmath52 channel there is a large effect around @xmath53 gev . at the energy of @xmath53 gev the @xmath23 and @xmath24 the peaks of figure 2 are just coming into play . since for @xmath52",
    "they are in a s - wave they have maximum effect . in the @xmath51",
    "these peak are suppressed by a p - wave barrier . around the mass @xmath53 gev",
    "one can form a picture of the system being @xmath7@xmath8(@xmath25 ) molecule at the center of gravity with a light pion revolving in a p - wave orbit .",
    "the momentum of the pion is such that at each half - revolution a @xmath23 or a @xmath24 is formed(see figure 5 ) .",
    "the phase shift and production cross sections of this molecular state is explored in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "the dibaryon state interacts in three two - body scattering channels .",
    "its mass is 2.15 gev and has a strong interaction resonance decay width of 100 mev .",
    "it interacts in the @xmath54@xmath54 d - wave spin anti - aligned@xcite , @xmath55@xmath22 p - wave spin aligned@xcite , and @xmath56@xmath54 s - wave spin aligned@xcite .",
    "the dibaryon system mainly resonates in the s - wave @xmath56@xmath54 mode with a pion rotating in a p - wave about a spin aligned @xmath54@xmath54 system which forms a isospin singlet .",
    "the pion moves back and forth forming @xmath56 states with one nucleon and then the other(see figure 6 ) .",
    "all three isospin states of the pion can be achieved in this resonance .",
    "thus we can have @xmath57@xmath55 , @xmath58@xmath55 , and @xmath59@xmath55 states . if the pion is absorbed by any of the nucleons it under goes a spin flip producing a d - wave @xmath54@xmath54 system .",
    "the resonance decays into @xmath54@xmath54 , @xmath22@xmath55 , or @xmath22@xmath54@xmath54 . in the last section we saw a meson system that had an analogous orbiting pion in a p - wave mode about a @xmath47 in a s - wave@xcite .",
    "both systems have a similar lifetime or width of @xmath60 .100 gev@xcite .      unlike the @xmath2 the @xmath3 has an isosinglet at the center of motion",
    ". the @xmath7@xmath8 isosinglet state of sec .",
    "1 could form the center of motion for an isotriplet molecular state @xmath6 .",
    "the set of integral equation would be the same as in the @xmath2 case making a similar fredholm determinant . like for @xmath3 which had a @xmath61 decay mode",
    ", one would expect that there would be a @xmath0 @xmath22 decay mode .",
    "we can calculate the branching ration of @xmath2 to @xmath25@xmath22 from the dalitz plot calculated using equation 20 of ref.@xcite .",
    "the ratio in the plot going into @xmath25@xmath22 is 22% .",
    "the reason this mode is so small is because @xmath62 is much smaller than @xmath63@xcite . where as the ratios of @xmath64 and @xmath65 are one at resonance(see figure 2 and 3 ) . for the @xmath3 the @xmath61 branching",
    "ratio is 25%@xcite .",
    "we should expect that the branching of @xmath66 should be the same as @xmath67 .",
    "suh - urk chung has claimed such a state has been observed@xcite .",
    "in sec . 2 we explained the @xmath68(1420 ) seen in @xmath69@xcite . following the same approach we can demonstrate the possibility that the @xmath70(1400 ) is a @xmath71 molecule , where the @xmath69 in a relative s - wave with the other @xmath22 orbiting them in a p - wave . since the @xmath69 is resonating as the @xmath21(1295 ) , it is possible that the offshell @xmath72 would couple to the ground state @xmath21 , thus creating a @xmath73 p - wave decay mode .    as was done in ref.@xcite , we need to arrange a set of born terms connecting all of the possible intermediate isobar states of the @xmath71 system ( @xmath21(1295)@xmath22 , @xmath25(980)@xmath74(770 ) , @xmath75(1270)@xmath8 or @xmath76@xmath7 ) .",
    "we assume that the only interaction among the particles occurs through one - particle exchange ( ope ) , thus connecting the above isobar states ( figure 7 ) .",
    "in order to completely derive the dynamics one would have to develop a true four - body scattering mechanism with ope born terms connecting two- and three - body isobar states .",
    "we can take a short cut and use the three - body formalism developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , if we note that the set of diagrams ( figure 8) could be summed using a true four - body formalism , and be replaced by the born term of figure 9 . here the @xmath25(980 ) is treated as a stable particle and the @xmath77 p - wave phase shift ( @xmath78 ) is assumed to be modified by the sum of terms in figure 8 . with this assumption ,",
    "then binding can occur if we use the @xmath79 propagators for the @xmath21(1295)(see figure 10 ) and @xmath78(see figure 11 ) . in figure 11",
    "we also show the unaltered p - wave phase shift ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "figure 12 shows the final state enhancement times the @xmath21(1295 ) @xmath22 p - wave kinematics .",
    "the bump is driven by the collision on the dalitz plot of the @xmath21(1295 ) breit - wigner ( figure 10 ) and the rapid increase of the @xmath77 p - wave phase shift ( figure 11 ) .",
    "we have suggested the possibility that the @xmath70(1400 ) is a final state interaction for the @xmath80 system in a s - wave orbiting by a @xmath22 in a p - wave .",
    "the @xmath73 decay mode is generated by the off shell appearance of the @xmath21 from the @xmath80 system ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "our model thus predicts that a strong @xmath81 should be seen in the @xmath82 system at around 1.4 gev / c@xmath83 .",
    "if the @xmath70(1400 ) is only seen in the @xmath73 channel then its hard to understand three facts about its production .",
    "first , that the force between the @xmath21 and @xmath22 in a p - wave should be repulsive ( qcd )  @xcite .",
    "this is not a problem if the @xmath73 is a minor decay mode .",
    "second , why should the production be so small compared to the @xmath84 which has only a 14% branching to @xmath73",
    "? one would think it should be produced in unnatural parity exchange not natural .",
    "again this is not a problem if minor decay mode .",
    "finally , it is reasonable to think that the largest decay amplitude would be the modes that have an @xmath25(980 ) in the final state .",
    "however in ref.@xcite the same conclusion was initially drawn , except when one puts in all the numerical factors the @xmath25 modes become suppressed .",
    "the explanation comes from the very powerful attraction of the kaons in the @xmath25 mode .",
    "the isobar decay amplitude is proportional to @xmath85 both @xmath54 and @xmath86 are large numbers while the ratio is near one at the threshold(see last section and ref.@xcite ) .",
    "thus the decay amplitude becomes proportional to @xmath87 .",
    "we predict that the major mode could be @xmath88 p - wave having no @xmath74 peak ( work above ) forming a @xmath89 or a @xmath90 plus a @xmath8 or @xmath7 with overall @xmath91-parity minus .",
    "the @xmath89 should more or less be a phase space distribution .",
    "we saw in sec.1 and sec .",
    "2 that the @xmath7@xmath8 system had attraction through the @xmath1 resonance . it seems only natural to investigate the possibility that a three - k molecule might exist .",
    "this is only worthwhile if we consider only exotic quantum numbers .",
    "the only exotic quantum number which can be be obtained is the isotopic spin .",
    "thus a set of coupled equations for the @xmath7@xmath8@xmath7 system in a overall s - wave with isotopic spin of @xmath92 is created@xcite .",
    "the fredholm determinate squared times of the equations is shown in figure 13 .",
    "isopin spin @xmath92 implies there are four states @xmath93@xmath94@xmath93,@xmath93@xmath95@xmath93 , @xmath96@xmath94@xmath96 , and @xmath96@xmath95@xmath96 .",
    "the @xmath93@xmath94@xmath93 is double charged .",
    "there would also be a @xmath95@xmath96@xmath95 which is the anti - matter state of the @xmath93@xmath94@xmath93 .",
    "these states are unique to this type of binding mechanism .",
    "in this report we have discussed seven possible hadron molecular states .",
    "these states are particles made out of hadrons that are held together by self interactions .",
    "the seven molecules and their self interactions are explored .",
    "the @xmath0 , @xmath1 relied quark exchange forces which made states of @xmath7@xmath8 lying just below threshold in scalar channel(@xmath11 ) .",
    "this is somewhat like the deuteron in the @xmath12 @xmath13 system .",
    "the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 molecular structure are held together by long range particle exchange mechanisms not the quark exchange that led to the van der walls forces@xcite .",
    "these exchange mechanisms also predicts that two more states the @xmath5 and @xmath6 should be found . for the @xmath6",
    "the set of integral equation would be the same as in the @xmath2 case making a similar fredholm determinant . like for @xmath3 which had a @xmath61 decay mode",
