    "in the standard unification model , all active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) , with different geometries resulting in various types of agns @xcite .",
    "that is , agn are grossly classified by whether broad emission lines are ( type 1 ) or are not ( type 2 ) present in the optical and uv spectrum . in the unified model ,",
    "the central accretion disk and surrounding retinue of high velocity gas is directly visible in type 1 agn , while this region is blocked from a direct view by a toroidal obscuring structure in type 2 agn . in the local universe , low - luminosity type",
    "2 agns ( type 2 seyfert galaxies ) are found to be as abundant as type 1 agns ( type 1 seyfert galaxies ) , and the applicability of the unified model is well - established ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "given the strong cosmic evolution of the agn population , the most luminous agns are very rare in the local universe and this population is only well - characterized at high redshift .",
    "unfortunately , the heavy obscuration by the dense gas and dust surrounding the smbh makes type 2 agns much fainter than type 1 agns and they become difficult to discover at high redshifts . it is therefore unclear how well the standard unified model works for agn of the highest luminosities and at high redshifts .",
    "indeed , x - ray surveys have shown that the ratio of type 2 to type 1 agn decreases with agn x - ray luminosity @xcite , but see @xcite for different results .",
    "this anti - correlation between obscuration and luminosity is in contrast to the results from the infrared , radio and optical surveys ( reyes et al .",
    "2008 , see lawrence & elvis 2010 for a review ) , which suggest that obscured agns are about as common as the unobscured ones at the highest probed luminosity .",
    "in this paper we will explore the hard x - ray and optical emission - line properties of the largest _ optically selected _",
    "sample available to date of highly luminous type 2 agn .",
    "we will then compare these properties to those of typical low - luminosity agn to test the unified model at high luminosity .",
    "we note that throughout the rest of our paper , we will use the term ` seyfert ' to refer to low - luminosity agn , and ` quasar ' to refer to high - luminosity agn ( with a dividing line at a bolometric luminosity greater than @xmath11 ) .",
    "a large sample of type 2 quasars are needed in order to test how and if the unified model applies at high luminosities .",
    "although the central engine is hidden from view in type 2 agn , the strong uv radiation escaping along the polar axis of the obscuring material distribution photo - ionizes circum - nuclear gas leading to strong narrow high - ionization emission - lines .",
    "since this narrow - line region is at larger radii than the bulk of the obscuring material , selection based on narrow optical emission lines promises to be less biased against type 2 agn than hard ( e @xmath12 10 kev ) x - ray surveys ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the narrow line emission mechanism is the same for both type 1s and 2s in the standard agn model , we can expect that the line luminosity serves as an indicator of the intrinsic luminosity of the nucleus , especially for the @xmath13 emission line , which is the strongest line in the optical spectra , and is not heavily contaminated by star - forming activities @xcite . when compared with the observed hard x - ray luminosity",

    "this new method has greatly expanded the number of type 2 quasars known , and it allows the properties of type 2 quasars to be studied in detail .",

    "the bolometric luminosities of these quasars are difficult to determine accurately , but their high overall energetics can be gleaned from the mid - infrared data ( spitzer and wise ) , where obscuring material thermally re - emits much of the absorbed radiation @xcite and monochromatic luminosities @xmath19 well in excess of @xmath20 erg s@xmath21 are often seen .",

    "thus , no single model could fit the spectra well in all cases .",

    "of our 71 quasars , at least crude spectral fitting is possible for 54 . for these , we find that the mean power - law index is @xmath48 using the best - fitting results in table [ t : fits ] ( those with photon indices fixed at 1.7 are excluded ) , where the error bar is the standard deviation of the power - law indices of the sample neglecting the individual fitting errors . in the case that there are multiple observations for one object , we use the values of the simultaneous joint fit instead .",
    "multiple observations may give different fluxes or observed luminosities due to agn variability .",

    "swift_-bat survey , which finds the mean value of photon index of the continuum power - law in the energy regime 15 - 195 kev is @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "it is also roughly consistent with that found in a sample of obscured agns selected by _ integral _ , which is @xmath50 .",
    "@xcite . however , if we use only the results in table [ t : fits ] for double - absorber power - law fits , it becomes larger , i.e. , @xmath51 .",
    "this distribution is much like the one found in the best fits of a sample of local seyfert 2s studied by @xcite , where more than half of the objects have double - absorbed power - laws as their best - fitting model . since the soft x - ray with steep slope could be biasing the spectral fit with power - law slopes tied , i.e. , the slope of agn only is flatter than the slope of agn plus star formation , this might result in the larger index of double - absorber power - law .",
    "we show the comparison between our best - fitting results and their samples in figure [ f : gamma ] , where we use different bins for the sample of @xcite for display purpose .    by excluding those with upper limits or fixed at @xmath52 for their column densities in spectral fits , we find the mean @xmath38 of our sample is @xmath53 @xmath54 using @xmath43 for single power - law and @xmath55 for double power - law fits from the best - fitting models listed in table [ t : fits ] .",
    "the @xmath56 distribution is consistent with those seyfert 2s as shown in figure [ f : nh ] .",
    "we will discuss the possible luminosity dependence of obscuration in the following sections .",
    "as the @xmath1@xmath25007 line emission originates in the narrow line region and so is not affected by the circumnuclear obscuration , the ratio between the observed hard x - ray ( 2 - 10 kev ) and @xmath1 line luminosity could be used as an indicator of the obscuration of the hard x - ray emission . in figure",
    "[ f : lxlo ] , we plot a histogram of the /  ratios for our sample listed in table [ t : fits ] .",
    "we also show the observed distributions for type 1 ( dashed blue line ) and type 2 agns ( dot - dashed red line ) @xcite . the x - ray to @xmath1",
    "luminosity ratio of our sample agrees well with that of type 2 agns from @xcite with a ks test @xmath57 , indicating that this sample is also likely experiencing obscuration .",
    "however , the fitted obscuring column densities inferred from the single - absorber power - law spectral fits are often too low to be consistent with the /  ratios of type 2 quasars , e.g. , the single - absorber model likely underestimates the amount of x - ray obscuration in our sample .",
    "thus , we estimate their obscuration in the following subsection by using the x - ray to  ratios .      compared with the local type 1 agns ,",
    "the derived observed /  ratio in table [ t : fits ] implies that the targets in our sample are more highly obscured than would be implied by the fitted column densities @xmath38 from our spectral models , i.e. , the column density is underestimated in our spectral fits for at least half of the whole sample .",
    "we therefore use the correlation between the hard x - ray and @xmath1 luminosity for both type 1 and 2 agns @xcite to more realistically estimate the absorbing column densities of our targets @xcite .",
    "we employ a monte carlo approach to take the dispersion in the sy 1 /   distribution into account .",

    "the difference between these simulated unobscured x - ray luminosities and the observed value is considered to be due to absorption . in order to assess",
    "how much absorption is consistent with the difference between the simulated and observed x - ray luminosities , we tabulated the expected fluxes and count rates for a partial covering model with covering fraction of 0.99 and photon index fixed at 1.7 and column densities varying from 0 to @xmath59 @xmath7 .",
    "we then interpolated the effective column density @xmath60 that predicts a model count rate consistent with the observed count rate for each agn .",
    "we compare the results from these simulations and the absorbed power - law spectral fits in figure [ f : nhsim ] .",
    "the fitted @xmath61 values from the single - absorber model ( black plus symbols ) are systematically lower than the simulated column densities , while @xmath55 from double - absorber model ( red asterisks ) are more consistent with the simulated column densities , showing that not surprisingly more complex spectral models do a better job of recovering the intrinsic column density implied by the attenuated x - ray flux relative to the @xmath1 emission .    additionally , we used the _ plcabs _ model in ` xspec ` @xcite to fit the spectra in order to approximately take compton scattering into account .",
    "this model assumes a spherical covering which is not likely to be the case but is nevertheless an improvement over fitting with absorption models that do not include scattering . in future work",
    "we will consider more advanced absorption models such as mytorus for sources with high enough signal - to - noise to warrant more advanced fitting .",
    "the results from fitting with both the simple partial covering model and _ plcabs _ are shown in table [ t : sim ] , where the lower limits for the simulated @xmath39 are derived for non - detections based on the upper limits for the photon count rates in table [ t : upper ] .",
    "as shown in table [ t : sim ] about half of the sources have a fitted column density @xmath62 much lower than the simulated @xmath60 .",
    "this indicates that direct spectral fitting still underpredicts the column density even by introducing compton scattering in some cases , which reaffirms the necessity of using /  ratio as an indicator of intrinsic obscuration . in summary these results",
    "imply that high signal - to - noise broadband spectra fitted with more complex ( and realistic ) models are more likely to recover the true ( higher ) column densities than simple power - law fits .",

    "we find a best - fit slope in the log - log plot of 0.88@xmath740.11 ( consistent with no significant luminosity - dependent x - ray obscuration ) , with significance of correlation @xmath75 .",
    "in fact , type 1 agns show a systematic decrease in the ratio of hard x - ray to bolometric luminosity at increasing bolometric luminosity .",
    "if the   luminosity is proportional to the bolometric luminosity , and if the amount of x - ray obscuration is independent on agn luminosity , then the relationship in @xcite would imply a slope of @xmath760.8 .",
    "this is fully consistent with the fitted slope in figure [ f : lxlo2 ] .",
    "recently , @xcite reported a nearly linear correlation between  and @xmath77 of a sample of type 1 agns selected from the cross - correlation of the 2xmmi and sdss dr7 catalogs .",
    "we show the correlation with the slope found by them in figure [ f : lxlo2 ] with @xmath78 deviation of our sample , where the line is shifted 1.26 dex downward to line up with the sample in this paper .",
    "this offset between the type 1 sample by @xcite and our type 2 sample is consistent with that reported by @xcite , indicating that @xmath79 ratio is still a good indicator of intrinsic obscuration for high - luminosity agns .    additionally , we compare the ratio of their x - ray and  luminosity with their geometric means in figure [ f : lxlo_geo ]",
    ". there appears to be a slight correlation ( slope @xmath80 in log - log scale ) between the two quantities as shown in the upper panel of figure [ f : lxlo_geo ] .",
    "however , if we exclude those highly - obscured sources with @xmath81 , this correlation becomes negligible , i.e. , the slope is nearly zero ( see the lower panel of figure [ f : lxlo_geo ] ) . comparing both cases , we find that the  correlation \" in the top panel of @xmath79 vs. @xmath82 is driven by the highly - obscured agns at lower luminosity .      in order to explain the x - ray background ( xrb ) spectrum above 10 kev , @xcite predict that the population of compton - thick agn is as numerous as that of compton - thin ones in their synthesis model of xrb fitting .    in figure",
    "[ f : lxlonh ] , we plot the column densities we derived from the simulations described in section [ simulation ] versus the /  ratio . since @xmath83 is derived from the difference between the typical seyfert 1 /  value and our observed / , it is not surprising that we find that the /  ratio decreases as the simulated @xmath84 increases .",
    "we designate a source as a compton - thick candidate if the @xmath78 confidence interval of simulated column density exceeds @xmath85 @xmath7 in figure [ f : lxlonh ] .",
    "in addition , sources with an iron line ew larger than 1 kev in table [ t : fe ] are also considered to be compton - thick , although the errors are often large . also note that in some cases , there is a possibility that the agn is compton - thick even thought the fe - k emission has a low ew ( e.g. , mkn 231 ) . by also including the three sources which have no hard x - ray photons detected , we find 39 quasars out of 71 ( @xmath86 ) are classified as compton - thick .",
    "we flagged them in table [ t : fits ] and [ t : upper ] .",
    "of course , the compton - thick fraction calculated in this way has large uncertainty due to the inaccuracy of simulated obscuration . taken the lower error bars of @xmath87 into account , there are 30 sources with @xmath88 @xmath7 , which is still a significant fraction of heavily obscured sources .",
    "this selection is basically equivalent to the approach based on @xmath79 in @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that a majority of compton - thick agns selected based on various obscuration diagnostics have ratios of 2 - 10 kev flux to intrinsic flux an order of magnitude lower than the mean values for seyfert 1s .",
    "if we adopt the mean @xmath79 value of type 1 seyferts found in @xcite , we find that the sources marked as compton - thick in table [ t : fits ] agree with the conclusion of flux ratio in @xcite , except a few outliers .",
    "as stated above , in a sample of 25 obscured quasars optically selected from sdss , v10 estimated the intrinsic x - ray luminosity from the observed @xmath1 emission line flux using @xcite , and compared it with the observed x - ray luminosities , i.e. , similar to our simulation procedure although our simulations take the dispersion in the seyfert 1 distribution into account .",
    "v10 conclude that a quasar could be identified as compton - thick if the ratio between the observed and predicted x - ray luminosities is less than 0.01 and find the fraction of compton - thick agn to be 65 per cent .",
    "however , they point out that -based selection results in an eddington bias that would naively lower the observed /  ratios and estimate that the true fraction is likely closer to 50% on the basis of the observed @xmath89 values for their sample .",
    "the v10 sample is selected from the catalog of 291 type 2 quasars in z03 , with @xmath90}>10^{9.28}l_{\\odot}$ ] ( note that the  luminosities used by v10 are from z03 , which are slightly different from those given by r08 due to a different  line fitting procedure ) .",
    "this sample had complete x - ray coverage . however , the r08 catalog is significantly larger , with 887 type 2 quasars selected by applying the same criteria to newer and more extensive sdss data .",
    "this increase in sample size , plus the larger range in  that we have probed means that our sample is not complete with respect to the optical selection .",
    "also , as discussed in v10 , the selection based on  line may miss some type 2 agns due to extinction .",
    "thus , it is necessary to discuss how the completeness may affect our estimation of the fraction of compton - thick agns . in figure",
    "[ f : completeness ] , we show the completeness of our sample in the catalog of r08 , which is the number of agns in our sample above a given  luminosity divided by the number of agns in r08 sample above the same  luminosity .",
    "although our sample only covers a small fraction ( @xmath91 ) of the parent sample in @xcite over most of the   luminosity range , the completeness rises rapidly at higher luminosities , reaching over @xmath92 in the luminosity range studied by v10 ( @xmath93}>10^{9.10}l_{\\odot}$ ] according to the new measurement of   luminosity by @xcite ) .",
    "if we limit the  luminosity range of our sample to that in v10 , the compton - thick fraction becomes @xmath94 ( 19 out of 34 ) with @xmath93}>10^{9.10}l_{\\odot}$ ] , consistent with the fraction reported in v10 . while with  luminosity above @xmath95 ,",
    "the compton - thick fraction is @xmath96 ( 8 out of 15 ) .",
    "although 45 out of the total 72 sources are on - axis targets , only 13 quasars in our sample were initially targeted observations by _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  and were not obviously selected independently of their x - ray properties .",
    "the others are either serendipitous objects in the field of view ( 27 ) or were observed in x - rays based on their  luminosities ( 32 ) .",
    "thus , the majority of our sample were not observed in x - rays based on their known x - ray properties . from this point of view",
    ", we can safely claim that our sample is not x - ray biased .",
    "we have presented the hard ( 2 - 10 kev ) x - ray spectral properties of 71 type 2 quasars in the redshift range of @xmath97 from _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _   archival data , which are selected based on their @xmath1@xmath25007 emission line luminosity .",
    "this is the largest sample of optically selected obscured quasars studied in x - rays to date .",
    "their observed @xmath1 luminosities range from @xmath98-@xmath99 .    of these 71 objects , 17 have limited photons detected , and we gave the 3-@xmath45 upper limits to their x - ray fluxes .",
    "for the remainder , we have fitted their x - ray spectra by assuming a single absorbed power - law to probe their spectral slope and circumnuclear obscuration .",
    "we use a more complicated model ( double - absorber power - law ) to re - do the spectral fits on 17 sources .",
    "we also fit the fe k@xmath9 fluorescent emission line in individual sources . for the others",
    ", we grouped them in four bins according to their observed /  ratios and and jointly fit their spectra to investigate the fe k@xmath9 feature .",
    "we also used a more physically realistic model to simulate the x - ray spectrum , which included partial covering by the absorber and the effects of compton scattering .",
    "our main results are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "for the 54 sources fitted with absorbed power - law we find the average value for the power - law index is @xmath100 .",
    "the average column density of our sample from the direct spectral fit is @xmath101 @xmath7 .",
    "2 .   the distribution of the /  ratio of our type 2 quasar sample agrees with that of local lower luminosity type 2 seyferts studied previously , indicating that they are experiencing similar amounts of x - ray obscuration .",
    "based on the small ratios of / , we find that the single - absorber power - law model underestimates the intrinsic x - ray obscuration .",
    "the double - absorber power - law model we applied to the 17 brightest sources also gave a higher column density than the single - absorber model .",
    "we constructed a more physically realistic model with partial covering of the central source and compton scattering to simulate the intrinsic column densities that produced the observed low /  ratio .",
    "we find that about half of our sample have simulated column densities one order of magnitude higher than from their single power - law spectral fits , but a significantly better agreement with the double power - law model results .",
    "we investigated the fe k@xmath9 features directly detected in 11 individual sources and the rest in groups by stacking ( jointly fitting ) their spectra .",
    "the anti - correlation between the iron line equivalent width and the /  ratio confirms the relationship studied previously @xcite . also , we find that the iron line luminosity correlates well with the @xmath1 line luminosity , extending the relation seen in type 2 seyferts to higher luminosities .",
    "these correlations illustrate that the weak observed hard x - ray emission is due to the heavy absorption around the central smbh , not due to intrinsically weak x - ray emission .",
    "the consistency of these correlations with those found in low - luminosity seyfert galaxies supports the standard model of agn at the high luminosity end .",
    "by combining our analysis with results for type 2 seyferts from @xcite we find no dependence of the simulated absorbing column densities on agn luminosity .",
    "we also find a nearly linear relationship between the [ oiii ] and x - ray luminosities .",
    "these results show that the amount of x - ray obscuration does not depend significantly on agn luminosity ( over a range in luminosity of over three orders - of - magnitude ) .",
    "6 .   based on the observed /  ratio and the simulated column densities",
    ", we find that about half of the total 71 quasars would be classified as compton - thick agns .",
    "when limiting the  range to higher values , the compton - thick fraction does not change significantly .",

    "<S> these objects were selected by cross - correlating the largest catalog of optically identified type 2 quasars to date selected from sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) with the _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  archives . </S>",
    "<S> the type 2 quasar sample was selected based on the high equivalent width of @xmath1@xmath25007 optical emission line which we assume to be an approximate indicator of the intrinsic agn luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> the archival x - ray spectra were fitted with absorbed power - law models to characterize the spectral properties of each source . for 54 objects with good spectral fits , </S>",
    "<S> the observed hard x - ray luminosity ranges from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , with the median of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the means of the column density and photon index of our sample are @xmath6 @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively </S>",
    "<S> . the observed ratios of hard x - ray and @xmath1 line luminosities imply that the majority of our sample suffer significant amounts of obscuration in the hard x - ray band . </S>",
    "<S> we also fit the spectra using a more physically realistic model which accounts for both compton scattering and a potential partial covering of the central x - ray source to estimate the true absorbing column density and use simulations to reproduce the observed /  ratios . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the absorbing column density estimates based on simple power - law models significantly underestimate the actual absorption in approximately half of the sources . </S>",
    "<S> eleven sources show a prominent fe k@xmath9 emission line ( ew@xmath10100 ev in rest frame ) , and we detect this line in the other sources through a joint fit ( spectral stacking ) . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation between the fe k@xmath9 and @xmath1 fluxes and the inverse correlation of the equivalent width of fe k@xmath9 line with the ratio of hard x - ray and @xmath1 fluxes is consistent with previous results for lower luminosity seyfert 2 galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that obscuration is the cause of the weak hard x - ray emission rather than intrinsically low x - ray luminosities . </S>",
    "<S> we find that about half of the population of optically - selected type 2 quasars are likely to be compton - thick . </S>",
    "<S> we also find no evidence that the amount of x - ray obscuration depends on the agn luminosity ( over a range of more than three orders - of - magnitude in luminosity ) . </S>"
