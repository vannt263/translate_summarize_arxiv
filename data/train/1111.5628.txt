    "the globular cluster system of the milky way has long been used to learn about the evolution of the galaxy .",
    "as the galactic globular clusters ( ggcs ) constitute some of the oldest systems in the milky way , the study of the stellar populations of these _ fossils _ can give us important clues of the early stages of the galaxy s formation .",
    "the tool most extensively used in this task has been the analysis of the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the presence of significant differential extinction in low - latitude fields , particularly near the galactic center , greatly complicates traditional cmd analyses . as a result",
    ", the study of many ggcs located towards the inner galaxy has been historically neglected .",
    "various recent studies have tried to overcome the difficulties associated with the study of inner ggcs to better exploit them as probes of the stellar populations near the galactic center .",
    "one obvious approach is to use near - infrared photometry to study these clusters ( e.g.,@xcite ) to take advantage of the smaller extinction in these bands . but",
    "to extract precise information about the ages of the ggcs , an accurate location of the main sequence turn - off ( msto ) point is crucial in most methods of cluster dating @xcite .",
    "infrared photometry sufficiently deep to reach the main sequence ( ms ) with enough precision to accurately locate the turn - off ( to ) point is difficult to achieve , and only now are we starting to see the first results after the careful application of new adaptive optics techniques on big telescopes @xcite .",
    "deep photometry for non - highly reddened ggcs is much more easily obtained in the optical , but at the cost of increased extinction .",
    "a number of techniques have been developed to produce extinction maps for individual clusters as a means of dealing with this issue ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in general , the resolution and accuracy of optical extinction maps are not adequate to fully eliminate the effects of differential reddening at a level of precision to produce deep optical cmds of similar high quality now typical for high - latitude clusters with little or no differential extinction ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we present a new optical photometric database consisting of a sample of 25 ggcs located towards the galactic center .",
    "we use a new dereddening technique ( @xcite , from now on referred to as paper i ) to map the differential extinction along their fields , and produce new , cleaner , differentially dereddened cmds of the clusters . in section 2 , we give the criteria used to define our sample of ggcs .",
    "section 3 summarizes the steps that we followed to obtain precise astrometry and optical photometry of the stars in these clusters suitable for our analyses . in section 4",
    "we apply the dereddening technique described in paper i , and provide an overview of the differentially dereddened cmds of the clusters in our sample , along with extinction maps along their fields .",
    "we also describe the characteristic features of the environments in which they are located , and briefly summarize previous optical and infrared photometric studies where appropriate .",
    "finally , in section 5 , we provide a summary of our results .",
    "the cluster sample presented in this study consists of 25 ggcs in the direction of the inner galaxy , all located within @xmath3 of the galactic center . because the precision of our dereddening technique ( paper i ) requires good sampling and photometry down to a few magnitudes below the msto , and also depends on the density of stars and the spatial variations in the extinction , the clusters in our sample were chosen to also satisfy the following criteria :    * exhibit moderate mean extinction , implying that they may suffer from extinction variations .",
    "we explicitly restricted our sample to clusters with a mean reddening of @xmath4 mag . *",
    "be sufficiently luminous to possess a well - defined ms .",
    "our analysis requires a significant number of stars ( at least a few hundreds ) to calculate the extinction in a region .",
    "we therefore chose clusters with a luminosity satisfying @xmath5 . *",
    "be relatively nearby . with our dereddening technique , the stars that provide most of the information about the differential extinction are those located in the cmd sequences most nearly orthogonal to the reddening vector ( subgiant branch ( sgb ) and upper ms ) .",
    "since one of the goals of this project is to accurately calculate the relative ages of these clusters , we must also reach the ms with good photometric precision at the to in order to carry out a reliable age / metallicity analysis . hence , we chose clusters with an apparent distance modulus of @xmath6 . *",
    "be sufficiently extended so that we can define maps that cover a significant solid angle around the clusters .",
    "we therefore chose clusters with a tidal radius @xmath7 arcmin .",
    "we were able to observe 25 of the 31 ggcs that fulfill these requirements , according to the 2003 version of the @xcite catalog .",
    "their positions are shown in figure [ figpos ] along with the rest of the clusters located in the inner galaxy .",
    "their characteristics , according to the most recent ( december 2010 ) version of the harris catalog , are given in table [ tabgc ] .",
    "we obtained optical photometric data for our sample of ggcs using the magellan 6.5 m baade telescope located at the las campanas observatory ( lco ) in chile , and the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) . in this section",
    "we provide a complete summary of these observations and explain in detail the steps followed for the reduction and calibration of the data .",
    "the final photometry has an absolute precision with respect to the calibrating stars of @xmath8 magnitudes in most cases .",
    "the internal precision among the stars observed in each field is around @xmath9 magnitudes , sufficient to achieve the precise extinction maps that will allow us to produce clean cmds . from these",
    "we will aim to derive the cluster parameters with an accuracy similar to those derived from high - galactic latitude clusters cmds that suffer little or no differential extinction .",
    "the ggcs in our sample were observed over four nights , may , 30th to june , 2nd 2005 , with the lco 6.5 m magellan baade telescope , using the inamori magellan areal camera and spectrograph ( imacs ) in imaging mode .",
    "we used the f/4 camera to image a field of view ( fov ) of @xmath10 , with a pixel size of @xmath11 .",
    "all fields were observed using standard johnson - cousins @xmath0,@xmath1 , and @xmath2 filters @xcite .",
    "two sets of observations with different exposure times ( short and long ) were taken in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 filters , and three ( extra - short , short , and long ) in @xmath2 , for every cluster .",
    "although the nights during our observing run were not all completely photometric , the seeing conditions were very good , with average values of @xmath12 in @xmath1 for the whole run .",
    "table [ tabobsmag ] lists the details of these ground - based photometry observations .    in order to obtain useful photometry of the inner regions of the more centrally crowded clusters",
    ", we supplemented our magellan images with images taken with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) aboard _",
    "these data were obtained in by our group s snapshot program 10573 .",
    "the acs has a fov of @xmath13 , with a pixel size of @xmath14 .",
    "five clusters of our sample were observed using the @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 filters .",
    "table [ tabobsacs ] lists the details of these new _ hst _ observations .    to better calibrate our photometry , we also used images available through the _ hst _ data archive for all the clusters in our sample .",
    "the data taken from the _ hst _ data archive are comprised of @xmath18 , @xmath16 , @xmath19 , and @xmath17 images obtained with the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfc2 ) , and of @xmath15 , @xmath19 , and @xmath17 images taken with the acs .",
    "table [ tabobsarc ] lists the different _ hst _ programs that we use data from .      for the ground - based data , the initial processing of the raw ccd images was done with the routines in the _ ccdred _ package of the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) .",
    "the images were first corrected for bias , then flatfielded using a combination of dome and twilight flats . afterward ,",
    "since different frames for every cluster were taken with different exposure times in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 filters ( see table [ tabobsmag ] ) , and they had small spatial offsets between them , the frames of every individual cluster were aligned , using the iraf task _ imalign _ , and average - combined for every exposure time and filter , with the iraf task _ imcombine_.    stellar photometry was carried out on the ground - based processed images using an updated version of dophot @xcite .",
    "this version works on any platform and accepts images consisting of real data values .",
    "it also provides better aperture corrections than previous versions , allowing for variations in aperture corrections as a function of field position and stellar magnitude ( see appendix [ ap1 ] ) .",
    "we also carried out an astrometric analysis of the cluster fields in our sample .",
    "we derived coordinates ( right ascension @xmath20 and declination @xmath21 ) for all stars detected in our photometric study by comparison with bright stars obtained in each field from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) catalog stars available through the infrared processing and analysis center ( ipac ) website . in practice ,",
    "more than 100 stars were available as astrometric references within the fields of every chip of our ccd camera . a third order polynomial fit , done with the iraf task _ mscpeak _ , produced dispersions of @xmath22 , consistent with the catalog precision .",
    "using the astrometric information of the images we could also calculate if there were variations in the pixel area coverage accross the images , which could lead to miscalculations in the measured fluxes . but the pixel area changed by less than @xmath23 across any of the chips of the camera , and therefore we did not need to apply any corrections to the measured photometry .",
    "to calibrate our ground - based data , we first transformed the photometry from each of the individual eight ccds in the camera in imacs to a common zero point , and then transformed this system to a standard system  in our case , the johnson - cousins system @xcite .",
    "we arbitrarily chose one of the ccds , chip 2 , as the one defining the instrumental system and brought the photometry from the other chips to this system ( see appendix [ ap2 ] ) .",
    "after this was done , we placed our photometry in the johnson - cousins photometric system by observing @xcite fields over a range of airmasses during the nights of our 2005 observing run ( see appendix [ ap3 ] ) . since these nights were not completely photometric we used @xcite photometric standard stars and the photometry from the clusters obtained with the _ hst _ to fine - tune the calibration of our ground - based data ( see appendix [ ap3 ] ) .",
    "the photometry of the data from the _ hst _ observations was obtained using the programs hstphot for the wfpc2 data",
    "@xcite and dolphot for the acs data @xcite .",
    "these programs have been specifically tailored to analyze data from these cameras .",
    "they take the images for every cluster retrieved from the the _ hst _ in the different filters , and analyze them all at the same time . the programs",
    "align the images , combine them and provide the final combined - frame and individual - frame photometry , both in the _ hst _ filter system and in the johnson - cousins system .",
    "we follow the author s prescriptions to give the input parameters for the analysis to both programs .",
    "photometric goodness - of - fit parameters were employed to select only objects with high - quality measurements .",
    "only measurements for which an object was classified as stellar ( hstphot and dolphot types 1 and 2 ) , and for which @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and errors in all measured magnitudes @xmath26 were retained .",
    "in this section we present the results of applying the dereddening method described in paper i to all the clusters in our sample of inner ggcs .",
    "we provide the cmds of these clusters before and after correcting for differential extinction and describe any improvements .",
    "we also provide the extinction maps that the dereddening technique generates , and compare them with the extinction maps supplied by @xcite , from now on referred as the sfd extinction maps . for each cluster , we provide references to its more recent  but not necessarily all optical and infrared photometric studies .",
    "we also report studies that explore the presence of different stellar populations in the observed ggcs , and speculate on the possibility of several stellar populations in some of the sampled clusters from the presence of a color - extended hb , as suggested in some recent studies @xcite .",
    "a detailed explanation of the dereddening method is provided in paper i , but we summarize here the different steps that we follow to apply the method , along with the results from every step , to obtain the final extinction maps and dereddened cmds .",
    "the technique is applied independently to the two available colors ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) , and it is only at the end of the process that the extinction maps obtained from both analyses are averaged .",
    "the first step of our dereddening method is to calculate the probabilities for the observed stars to belong to the cluster . in order to do that",
    ", we first calculate the surface density of the stars as functions of distance @xmath29 to the cluster center , as explained in paper i , and by a fit with an empirical @xcite profile plus constant field model ( see figure [ figking1 ] and table [ tabking ] ) obtain , using equation 12 from paper i , the conditional probabilities of the stars being members of the cluster as a function of position in the sky @xmath30 ( see figure [ figking2 ] ) , where @xmath31 indicates membership to the cluster ( @xmath32 indicates observation of a member , and @xmath33 indicates observation of a non - member )",
    ". then we calculate , following paper i , the probability densities of the observed stars as a function of @xmath29 , color @xmath34 , and magnitude @xmath35 , and the probability density of being field members as function of @xmath34 and @xmath35 by comparison with a besanon model @xcite ( see table [ tabbesancon ] ) . finally ,",
    "applying equation 20 from paper i , we are able to find @xmath36 , the conditional probabilities of the stars being members of the cluster as a function of position in the sky and in the cmd ( see figure [ figprobm4 ] in this paper , and figure 4 from paper i as examples of the method ) .",
    "we restrict our analysis to stars down to the completeness limit of our observations , and areas in which the probability @xmath37 ( see table [ tabclimit ] ) , as calculated in equation 13 in paper i. there are a few cases in which we do not calculate @xmath36 for one of the colors , since the observed cmd of the cluster is not calibrated in that color ( ngc 6558 in @xmath27 , and ngc 6235 , ngc 6342 and ngc 6355 in @xmath28 ) , and a comparison with the besanon models can lead to mistakes . in those cases , we equal the total probability to just @xmath30 ( see equation 13 in paper i ) , and proceed with the next steps of the analysis , which are not affected by any constant offset in the color calibration .",
    "once the cluster membership probabilities have been calculated , we need to build the ridgeline for the cmds of every cluster in our sample .",
    "we follow the three - step recipe described in paper i to obtain the ridgelines , instead of @xmath37 as in paper i. for homegeneity on the process through the sample , we apply this more severe cut to calculate the ridgelines of all the observed clusters . ] for both available colors ( see figures [ figridgebv ] and [ figridgevi ] ) .",
    "after that , we move the stars along the reddening vector @xcite until they intersect the ridgeline , and smooth the resulting individual color excesses by building a bivariate non - parametric regression of the extinction as a function of the spatial coordinates right ascension and declination , which allows us to generate an extinction map away from the extinction value calculated in the previous iteration , as opposed to the @xmath38 threshold mentioned in paper i. again for homegeneity on the process through the sample , we apply this more severe cut to calculate the extinction maps of all the observed clusters . ] . from this map ,",
    "we take the relative extinction that corresponds to every star observed .",
    "we then plot the cmd of the stars in our observation after having been corrected for the differential reddening and use it as the input for the next iteration .",
    "finally , after the process converges for both colors , we average the extinction maps obtained from both colors , generating a final extinction map and the dereddened cmds ( see figures [ figngc6121 ] to [ figngc6809 ] ) .",
    "we now describe in more detail the individual cases of the different clusters in the sample .",
    "we display their @xmath27 vs. @xmath1 and @xmath28 vs. @xmath1 cmds , before and after being differentially dereddened ( see figures [ figngc6121 ] to [ figngc6809 ] ) , and describe any improvements in the photometry .",
    "the cmds are plotted using the merged space and ground data , whenever space - based observations deeper than ground - based observations exist , or the ground photometry in the rest of the cases . to quantify improvements in the photometry ,",
    "we have measured the definition of the evolutionary sequences in the cmd by fitting gaussian functions to different magnitude cuts in the different sequences ( 1.5 mag above and 0.5 mag below the to , this is , rgb and upper ms ) , similar to what we did in figure 9 of paper i. to give an idea of the importance of the field star contamination , we compare the total number of observed stars in every fov with the number of stars provided by the besanon model of the galaxy for the same pointing and fov .",
    "we also present the extinction maps across the field of the clusters , along with their resolution and precision ( see figures [ figngc6121 ] to [ figngc6809 ] , and table [ tabdifred ] ) .",
    "we compare these maps with the sfd extinction maps ( see figure [ figschelegel ] ) .",
    "the extinction maps provided by our dereddening technique give the differential extinction in the field referred to the unknown absolute extinction where our ridgelines lie .",
    "the comparison with the sfd maps allows us to establish these absolute extinction zero points . in order to make the comparison , we need to bring down our extinction maps to the lower resolution of the sfd maps .",
    "since our extinction maps are described by non - parametric continuous functions of the spatial coordinates right ascension and declination , as mentioned in previous paragraphs , we evaluate these functions in @xmath39 different points in every pixel of the sfd maps and average the obtained values using our precision maps to calculate a weighted average that provides us with one extinction value per sfd pixel .",
    "we observe that both our maps and the sfd maps generally agree in identifying the same regions of higher and lower extinction , although our maps usually show higher variation ( reaching sometimes a factor of 2 ) in the extinction values than the sfd maps .",
    "notice also that the sfd maps give the extinction integrated along the line of sight ( i.e. , extinction in the foreground , but also in the background of the observed clusters ) , while the extinction maps provided by our technique show the extinction just in the foreground of the observed clusters .",
    "the changes in the extinction across the field are significant ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the highest extinction is located in the northwestern region of the field , while the northeastern region of the field shows the lowest .",
    "there is a small blob of higher extinction ( @xmath41 ) @xmath42 south of the center of the cluster , which the sfd map fails to show ( see figure [ figschelegel ] ) . the absolute extinction zero point of our reddening map is @xmath43 from comparing our map with the sfd map .",
    "these significant values of extinction , both absolute and differential , are a consequence of the cluster being located behind the ophiucus dust complex , about 120 pc away from us .",
    "m 4 is likely the closest gc to the sun . because of this",
    ", stars in the upper rgb are saturated in our images , even in the shortest exposures , and they do not appear in our cmds of this cluster .",
    "the region studied for this cluster encompasses the whole fov of our ccd , since the number of field stars present is small ( @xmath44 of the stars in our cmd ) . due to the proximity of m 4 to the sun ,",
    "most of the field stars are located behind the cluster .",
    "they are generally dimmer than the cluster stars , and the evolutionary sequences of the field stars are easily differentiable from the cluster sequences .",
    "the definition of the different branches in the cmd of the cluster are improved after the dereddening process , especially in the @xmath45 cmd .",
    "the evolutionary sequences get @xmath46 tighter there .",
    "a noticeable feature in the cmds of this cluster is the presence of a bimodal hb , with both red and blue components , though the blue hb ( bhb ) is not very extended .",
    "this bimodality of the hb , noted also in previous studies ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) , suggests the presence of several stellar populations in this cluster .",
    "some recent ground - based optical photometric studies of this cluster include @xcite in @xmath47 , @xcite in @xmath48 , and @xcite in @xmath49 .",
    "recent deep optical _",
    "hst _ cmds of this cluster have been presented in @xmath50 by @xcite , in @xmath51 by @xcite , and in @xmath52 by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this cluster is also a member of the acs survey of ggcs obtained in the @xmath52 bands @xcite .",
    "recent infrared photometric studies of this cluster are by @xcite in @xmath53 , and by @xcite in @xmath54 .",
    "@xcite also used the _ hst _ for an optical and infrared study of the stellar mass function of this cluster in @xmath55 .",
    "the presence of significant differential reddening in this cluster has been pointed out in many studies , and a map of the differential extinction was provided by @xcite ( see figure [ figmapcomp ] ) .",
    "recently , the presence of distinct populations has been suggested from spectroscopic studies of stars in the rgb @xcite and in the hb @xcite .",
    "ngc 6144 is also located behind the @xmath56 ophiuchi dust cloud and very close ( @xmath57 northeast ) to ngc 6121 ( m 4 ) .",
    "unsurprisingly , ngc 6144 also suffers from high and differential reddening .",
    "the variation of the extinction across the field is one of the highest shown in our sample ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "extinction is higher in the northern region of the observed field , @xmath59 from the center of the cluster , and peaks in the northeastern area .",
    "the absolute extinction zero point of our reddening map is @xmath60 from comparing our map with the sfd map .",
    "this is one of the few cases in which the differential extinction variation across the field is more important ( by a factor of 2 ) in the sfd maps than in ours .",
    "the region studied for this cluster encompasses the whole fov of our ccd , since there is only a moderate field star contamination ( @xmath61 of the stars in our cmd ) . also the field stars are redder on average than the stars in the cluster whose different evolutionary sequences",
    "are clearly distinguishable in the cmd . even if previous works ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    "give a higher value for the reddening vector towards @xmath56 ophiuchi dust cloud , with @xmath62 , still with the lower value assumed in our method , @xmath63 , the different evolutionary sequences get better defined ( @xmath64 tighter ) in the cmd of the cluster after applying the dereddening process .",

    "in this work , we have obtained the photometry using a new version of dophot .",
    "dophot is a software created to extract psf photometry from astronomical images . a complete and deep explanation of its main characteristics , and a description of how it works , is given by @xcite    the main new characteristics of the distribution of dophot we developed for this work are :    * all the program subroutines and functions",
    "have been rewritten to make them compatible with the standards of fortran90 .",
    "* we have tried to make the subroutines and functions more easily readable . to achieve this ,",
    "we have eliminated all the common statements present in previous versions and named all the variables used by the subroutine and function in the call statement . also with the same spirit of making the program more understandable we have created , combined or eliminated some of the subroutines , and included , at the beginning of each file , a brief explanation of what every function and subroutine does . *",
    "the program works now with real values for the pixel values , so there is no need to worry about conversions to integers as in previous distributions . *",
    "the stars are masked , obliterated , added , and subtracted across the different subroutines of the program in circular sections , and not in rectangular sections as before .",
    "this way fewer usable pixels are obliterated , and fewer pixels outside an interesting radius are dealt with .",
    "in addition to this , this distribution shares some of the characteristics of the program that were present in previous distributions , but that were not mentioned in the original paper :    * dophot allows for a variable psf model in the image .",
    "* dophot can perform an aperture correction to the magnitudes obtained , according to their positions and magnitudes .",
    "the program checks for variations in the aperture correction in magnitude and in position in the image , and corrects the fitted magnitude accordingly .",
    "this new version of dophot is publicly available through : + http://www.astro.puc.cl/@xmath160jalonso/dophot.tar",
    "the camera in imacs consists of eight chips , each with its own slightly different mean quantum efficiency and color sensitivity . to calibrate our data",
    ", we must first transform the photometry from each of the individual chips to a common zero point , then transform this system to a standard system  in our case , the johnson - cousins system @xcite . in this appendix",
    ", we shall focus on the first step of transforming the individual chips to a common instrumental system .    for this purpose",
    ", we arbitrarily chose one of the chips , chip 2 ( see figure [ figchipcal ] ) , as the one defining the instrumental system .",
    "the goal was to tie all the other chips to this chip s photometric zero point .",
    "we attempted to do this in two ways .",
    "first , we observed one @xcite field ( pg 1047 + 003 ) in every one of the chips and in all three filters ( bvi ) in rapid succession on every night of our run .",
    "there were very few stars in this field , and the scatter we found in the mean photometric offsets  about 0.05 mag between chips  was too large given our need to bring all our photometry to a common system to  1 - 2% precision .",
    "we surmise that the relatively poor results from this approach reflects the quality of the nights during the 2005 run , and also possible flat - field variations at the 2 - 3% level for this run .",
    "we tried a second approach during a sequence of observations during a 2006 magellan run ( see table [ tabobsmag ] ) in which we tried to auto - calibrate the imacs chip array using stars from the cluster ngc 6397 .",
    "the basic idea was to obtain a minimal number of exposures in each filter so that at least part of all chips overlapped with chip 2 , the chip defining our instrumental photometric system .",
    "we found that a sequence of three exposures could achieve the desired overlap .",
    "figure [ figchipcal ] illustrates the approach . in the left panel ,",
    "the darker outline of the imacs chip shows the location of a first exposure , in this case at the same location as the actual field we observed in 2005 for the cluster ngc 6397 .",
    "the second exposure , shown as a lighter ( red ) outline is offset in both ra and dec so that four of its chips ( 1 , 2 , 5 and 6 ) overlap with the position of chip 2 in the first exposure .",
    "the right panel again shows the initial pointing in the darker outline , with a third pointing as a lighter ( green ) outline .",
    "now , chips 3 , 4 , 7 and 8 of the last exposure overlap with chip 2 from the first exposure .",
    "this sequence , repeated for each filter , generated a large list of stars that have been observed on chip2 _ and _ on every other chip in the array .",
    "because only three exposures were required and because we took these in rapid succession , we can safely ignore airmass variations as we calculate the offsets from a given chip to the system defined by chip 2 .",
    "in addition , we have exposures from the 2005 and 2006 runs of the _ same _ fields ( the dark outlines in figure [ figchipcal ] ) that allow us to determine any possible variations in chip sensitivities between runs .",
    "the model we used to transform each chip to the chip 2 system has the form @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the instrumental magnitude of chip @xmath163 ( excluding @xmath164 ) , @xmath165 is the zero - point offset from chip @xmath163 to chip 2 , and @xmath166 is the color coefficient for instrumental color @xmath167 . in practice , we carried out this analysis separately for each filter , b , v , and i , with the colors defined appropriately for each filter ( @xmath168 for the b - band transformation and @xmath169 for the v and i - band transformations ) .",
    "we found that the color terms are all negligibly small in the chip - to - chip transformations for each filter , so the final model adopts @xmath170 for all chips and all colors .",
    "thus we only had to detemine the mean values of the @xmath165 coefficients as the weighted mean of the differences of the instrumental magnitudes , @xmath171 , for all stars in common between chip @xmath163 and chip 2 .",
    "weights for each measurement were assigned according to the photometric errors and the dispersion in the offset ditribution .",
    "a first application of this approach , to the calibration sequence of ngc 6397 obtained in 2006 ( figure [ figchipcal ] ) , allowed us to place all the data from that run on the 2006 chip 2 instrumental system .",
    "since the relative sensitivities of the chips might have changed between the 2005 and 2006 runs , we then took an additional step to define the chip - to - chip offsets for the 2005 run from which all our ground - based cluster photometry is defined .",
    "this process involves the observations of ngc 6397 from our 2006 run ( described above ) and the observations of the same field for the same cluster obtained in 2005 .",
    "for this purpose we adopted the following transformation : @xmath172 the zero - point offset from the 2005 observations required to place them on the 2006 system for chip @xmath163 is given by @xmath173 ( this now includes the case @xmath164 ) , for a color term @xmath174 , and an instrumental color on the 2005 system of @xmath167 .",
    "the final two terms account for the different airmasses and possibly different extinction coefficients for each run and each observation .",
    "we do not know this product ( extinction coefficient @xmath175 times airmass @xmath31 ) for the 2006 run , because we did not observe standard stars on that run .",
    "but we know that the sum of these products is constant when comparing the 2005 and 2006 ngc 6397 observations . thus , we can rewrite the equation above as @xmath176 in close analogy to equation b1 .",
    "note that the new zero point offset now implicitly includes the airmass terms : @xmath177 we can simplify this due to the fact that we found that the color terms in equation b3 are all negligibly small .",
    "thus we only had to detemine the mean values of the @xmath178 coefficients as the weighted mean of the differences of the instrumental magnitudes , @xmath179 , for all stars from chip @xmath163 .",
    "as before , weights for each measurement were assigned according to the photometric errors and the dispersion in the offsets distribution .    at this stage , we can transform the 2005 ngc 6397 data to a common instrumental system defined by chip 2 from the 2006 observations of this same cluster .",
    "but what we really require are the offsets in the 2005 system that bring all data from the imacs chips obtained in 2005 to a common system .",
    "that is , the final chip - to - chip offsets for the 2005 data are simply @xmath180    the values of @xmath181 and @xmath182 required to tie the various chips systems to a common system defined by chip 2 are listed in table [ tabzp ] .",
    "the errors in the values of @xmath181 and @xmath182 are @xmath183 , the error of the mean of the distributions used to obtain them ( see figure [ figzp ] ) .",
    "the dispersions of the distributions from which these @xmath181 and @xmath182 are derived , a measure of the internal precision of our photometry , are @xmath184 .",
    "we placed our photometry in the johnson - cousins photometric system by observing @xcite fields over a range of airmasses during the nights of our 2005 observing run .",
    "since the first two nights were the most photometric of our run , we only used the standard fields observed those two nights to obtain the following transformations : @xmath185 @xmath186 @xmath187 where @xmath31 is the airmass , @xmath188 and @xmath163 are the instrumental magnitudes in the instrumental system and @xmath189 and @xmath2 the corresponding magnitudes in the johnson - cousins photometric system .    to fine - tune",
    "our calibration we decided to compare our photometry with @xcite photometric standard stars .",
    "we found in some cases significant absolute offsets between stetson s and our photometry .",
    "these zero points could be easily calculated ( see table [ tabcalstars ] and figure [ figstetmag ] ) .",
    "however , only thirteen of our clusters had stars in common with stetson s catalog , and only twelve had stars calibrated in all three filters",
    ".    to extend the comparison to more clusters , we looked for members of our sample already observed with at least one of the two _ hst _ s optical wide - field imaging instruments , wfpc2 and acs .",
    "we found that all of the clusters have already been observed at least in two of our filters , and most of them in all three ( see table [ tabcalstars ] ) .",
    "we retrieved the available data from the _ hst _ archive and derived photometry from the stars in these data using the programs hstphot for the wfpc2 data @xcite and dolphot for the acs data @xcite .",
    "these programs have been specifically tailored to analyze data from these cameras .",
    "the comparison between the _ hst _ and ground - based data is complicated by the large resolution difference in the datasets and the highly crowded fields . when the offsets in the photometries of individual stars of a cluster are plotted , there is a clear , asymmetric spread in the data ( see figure [ fighstmag ] ) . due to the higher resolution of the _ hst _ , individual stars in the _ hst _ data are blends in the ground - based data . to obtain the absolute offset between the two systems eliminating the blended stars effect we calculated a weighted mean of the offsets of the stars in common ( see figure [ fighstmag ] ) , where the weights were assigned according to the photometric errors and the dispersion in the offset distribution .",
    "the weighted mean was iteratively calculated , ignoring stars 2@xmath190 away from the mean value at each iteration .",
    "whenever we have zero points calculated separately from independent wfpc2 and acs data , a mean value was adopted .",
    "the results were then compared with the ones we found from the stetson comparison , since our aim is to put all the photometry in the stetson system ( see figure [ fighststet ] ) . a small offset for each filter was found and added to the individual cluster zero points ( @xmath191 mag , @xmath192 mag , and @xmath193 mag ) .",
    "these offsets may be due to the fact that the _ hst _ observations used in our absolute calibration are located closer to the center of the cluster than the stetson stars used , or they may reflect small system zero point differences .",
    "the final offsets applied to the individual clusters can be seen in table [ taboffsets ] .",
