    "neutrinos exist in equilibrium with the electromagnetic plasma in the early universe , until a temperature of a few mev . at this point",
    "the weak interactions freeze out and neutrinos decouple from the plasma . shortly after this event",
    ", the temperature of the plasma falls below the electron mass , and electrons and positrons annihilate , dumping their entropy into the photon gas .",
    "this heats the photon gas while having no effect on neutrinos , and the end result is that the photon temperature is larger than the neutrino temperature by the factor @xmath0 .",
    "since the present day photon temperature has been measured with great accuracy to be 2.728 k , the neutrino temperature is known to be 1.95 k , or about @xmath1 ev .",
    "since the heaviest neutrino has a mass of at least about 0.04 ev it must at present be extremely non - relativistic and therefore acts as dark matter .",
    "the contribution of a single neutrino species of mass @xmath2 to the present day matter density can be written as @xcite @xmath3 so that for a neutrino mass of about 30 ev , neutrinos will make up all of the dark matter .",
    "however , this would have disastrous consequences for structure formation in the universe , because neutrinos of ev mass have very large free streaming lengths and would erase structure in the neutrino density on scales smaller than @xmath4 completely .",
    "this leads to an overall suppression of matter fluctuations at small scales , an effect which is potentially observable .",
    "the absolute value of neutrino masses are very difficult to measure experimentally . on the other hand ,",
    "mass differences between neutrino mass eigenstates , @xmath5 , can be measured in neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "observations of atmospheric neutrinos suggest a squared mass difference of @xmath6 ev@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "while there are still several viable solutions to the solar neutrino problem from solar neutrino observations alone , the large mixing angle ( lma ) solution gives by far the best fit with @xmath8 ev@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "recently the kamland reactor neutrino experiment has announced a positive detection of neutrino oscillations indicating that the lma solution is indeed correct @xcite .    in the simplest case where neutrino masses are hierarchical",
    "these results suggest that @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "if the hierarchy is inverted @xcite one instead finds @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "however , it is also possible that neutrino masses are degenerate @xcite , @xmath15 , in which case oscillation experiments are not useful for determining the absolute mass scale .",
    "experiments which rely on kinematical effects of the neutrino mass offer the strongest probe of this overall mass scale .",
    "tritium decay measurements have been able to put an upper limit on the electron neutrino mass of 2.2 ev ( 95% conf . )",
    "however , cosmology at present yields an even stronger limit which is also based on the kinematics of neutrino mass . as discussed before any structure in the neutrino density below the free - streaming scale",
    "is erased and therefore the presence of a non - zero neutrino mass suppresses the matter power spectrum at small scales relative to large scale , roughly by @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this power spectrum suppression allows for a determination of the neutrino mass from measurements of the matter power spectrum on large scales , as well as the spectrum of cmb fluctuations .",
    "this matter spectrum is related to the galaxy correlation spectrum measured in large scale structure ( lss ) surveys via the bias parameter , @xmath17 .",
    "such analyses have been performed several times before @xcite , most recently using data from the 2dfgrs galaxy survey @xcite .",
    "these investigations found mass limits of 1.5 - 3 ev , depending on assumptions about the cosmological parameter space .    in a seminal paper",
    "it was calculated by eisenstein , hu and tegmark that future cmb and lss experiments could push the bound on the sum of neutrino masses down to about 0.3 ev @xcite .",
    "the prospects for an absolute neutrino mass determination was discussed in further detail in ref .",
    "@xcite where it was found that in fact the upper bound could be pushed to 0.12 ev ( 95% conf . ) using data from the sloan digital sky survey and the upcoming planck satellite .",
    "more recently the new wmap data , in conjunction with large scale structure data from 2dfgrs has been used to put an upper bound on the sum of all neutrino species of @xmath18 ev ( 95% conf . )",
    "@xcite .",
    "however , the exact value of this upper bound depends strongly on priors on other cosmological parameters , mainly @xmath19 . in the present paper",
    "we calculate the upper bound on @xmath20 from present cosmological data , with an emphasis on studying how the bound depends on the data set chosen .",
    "in addition to their contribution to the cosmological mass density neutrinos also contribute to the cosmological energy density around the epoch of recombination .",
    "neutrinos which have mass smaller than roughly @xmath21 , where @xmath22 ev is the temperature of recombination , will act as fully relativistic particles when it comes to cmb and large scale structure .    in the standard model",
    "there are three light neutrino species with this property .",
    "however , these particles are not necessarily in an equilibrium fermi - dirac distribution with zero chemical potential .",
    "it is well known that the universe contains a non - zero baryon asymmetry of the order @xmath23 .",
    "a neutrino asymmetry of similar magnitude would have no impact on cosmology during cmb and lss formation , but since the neutrino asymmetry is not directly observable it could in principle be much larger than the baryon asymmetry .",
    "such a neutrino asymmetry would effectively show up as extra relativistic energy density in the cmb and lss power spectra .",
    "another possibility for extra relativistic energy is that there are additional light species beyond the standard model which have decoupled early ( such as the graviton or the gravitino ) .    from the perspective of late time evolution at @xmath24 mev",
    "it is customary to parametrize any such additional energy density in terms of @xmath25 @xcite , the equivalent number of neutrino species . in section",
    "iii we discuss bounds on @xmath25 from the present wmap and 2dfgrs data , combined with additional information on other cosmological parameters from the hubble hst key project and the supernova cosmology project .",
    "however , as will be discussed later , a non - zero neutrino chemical potential can have an effect on big bang nucleosynthesis which is profoundly different from simple relativistic energy density if it is located in the electron neutrino sector .",
    "another important point is that any entropy production which takes place after bbn , but prior to cmb formation will only be detectable via cmb and lss observations .",
    "one such example is the decay of a hypothetical long - lived massive particle at temperatures below roughly 0.01 mev .",
    "the extraction of cosmological parameters from cosmological data is a difficult process since for both cmb and lss the power spectra depend on a plethora of different parameters .",
    "furthermore , since the cmb and matter power spectra depend on many different parameters one might worry that an analysis which is too restricted in parameter space could give spuriously strong limits on a given parameter .",
    "the most recent cosmological data is in excellent agreement with a flat @xmath26cdm model , the only non - standard feature being the apparently very high optical depth to reionization .",
    "therefore the natural benchmark against which non - standard neutrino physics can be tested is a model with the following free parameters : @xmath27 , the matter density , the curvature parameter , @xmath28 , the baryon density , @xmath19 , the hubble parameter , @xmath29 , the scalar spectral index of the primordial fluctuation spectrum , @xmath30 , the optical depth to reionization , @xmath31 , the normalization of the cmb power spectrum , @xmath32 , the bias parameter , and finally the two parameters related to neutrino physics , @xmath33 and @xmath25 . the analysis can be restricted to geometrically flat models , i.e.@xmath34 . for the purpose of actual power spectrum calculations ,",
    "the cmbfast package @xcite can be used .      at present",
    ", by far the largest survey available is the 2dfgrs @xcite of which about 147,000 galaxies have so far been analyzed .",
    "tegmark , hamilton and xu @xcite have calculated a power spectrum , @xmath35 , from this data , which we use in the present work .",
    "the 2dfgrs data extends to very small scales where there are large effects of non - linearity .",
    "since we only calculate linear power spectra , we use ( in accordance with standard procedure ) only data on scales larger than @xmath36 , where effects of non - linearity should be minimal @xcite . making this cut",
    "reduces the number of power spectrum data points to 18 .",
    "the cmb temperature fluctuations are conveniently described in terms of the spherical harmonics power spectrum @xmath37 , where @xmath38 .",
    "since thomson scattering polarizes light there are additional powerspectra coming from the polarization anisotropies .",
    "the polarization can be divided into a curl - free @xmath39 and a curl @xmath40 component , yielding four independent power spectra : @xmath41 and the temperature @xmath42-polarization cross - correlation @xmath43 .",
    "the wmap experiment have reported data only on @xmath44 and @xmath43 , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite    we have performed the likelihood analysis using the prescription given by the wmap collaboration which includes the correlation between different @xmath45 s @xcite .",
    "foreground contamination has already been subtracted from their published data .    in parts of the data analysis",
    "we also add other cmb data from the compilation by wang _",
    "@xcite which includes data at high @xmath46 .",
    "altogether this data set has 28 data points .",
    "the analysis presented here was originally published in ref .",
    "@xcite , and more details can be found there .",
    "we have calculated @xmath47 as a function of neutrino mass while marginalizing over all other cosmological parameters .",
    "this has been done using the data sets described above . in the first case",
    "we have calculated the constraint using the wmap @xmath44 combined with the 2dfgrs data , and in the second case we have added the polarization measurement from wmap . finally we have added the additional constraint from the hst key project and the supernova cosmology project .",
    "it should also be noted that when constraining the neutrino mass it has in all cases been assumed that @xmath25 is equal to the standard model value of 3.04 .",
    "later we relax this condition in order to study the lsnd bound .",
    "the result is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "as can be seen from the figure the 95% confidence upper limit on the sum of neutrino masses is @xmath48 ev ( 95% conf . ) using the case with priors .",
    "this value is completely consistent with what is found in ref .",
    "@xcite where simple gaussian priors from wmap were added to the 2dfgrs data analysis .",
    "for the three cases studied we find the following limits :    @xmath49 ev = for wmap+wang+2dfgrs+hst+sn - ia + @xmath50 ev for wmap+wang+2dfgrs + @xmath51 ev for wmap+2dfgrs    in the middle panel of fig .  1 we show the best fit value of @xmath19 for a given @xmath33 .",
    "it is clear that an increasing value of @xmath20 can be compensated by a decrease in @xmath19 . even though the data yields a strong constraint on @xmath52",
    "there is no independent constraint on @xmath27 in itself .",
    "therefore , an decreasing @xmath19 leads to an increasing @xmath27 . this can be seen in the bottom panel of fig .  1 .",
    "when the hst prior on @xmath19 is relaxed a higher value of @xmath20 is allowed , in the case with only wmap and 2dfgrs data the upper bound is @xmath53 ( 95% conf . ) , corresponding to a neutrino mass of 0.71 ev for each of the three neutrinos .",
    "this effect was also found by elgary and lahav @xcite in their analysis of the effects of priors on the determination of @xmath20 .    however , as can also be seen from the figure , the addition of high-@xmath46 cmb data from the want _ et al .",
    "_ compilation also shrinks the allowed range of @xmath20 significantly .",
    "the reason is that there is a significant overlap of the scales probed by high-@xmath46 cmb experiments and the 2dfgrs survey .",
    "therefore , even though we use bias as a free fitting parameter , it is strongly constrained by the fact that the cmb and 2dfgrs data essentially cover much of the same range in @xmath54-space .",
    "it should be noted that elgary and lahav @xcite find that bias does not play any role in determining the bound on @xmath20 . at first",
    "this seems to contradict the discussion here , and also what was found from a fisher matrix analysis in ref .",
    "the reason is that in ref .",
    "@xcite , redshift distortions are included in the 2dfgrs data analysis . given a constraint on the amplitude of fluctuations from cmb data , and a constraint on @xmath52 ,",
    "this effectively constrains the bias parameter . therefore adding a further constraint on bias in their analysis does not change the results .     as a function of @xmath20 for different choices of priors .",

    "_ neutrinoless double beta decay _",
    "recently it was claimed that the heidelberg - moscow experiment yields positive evidence for neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "such experiments probe the  effective electron neutrino mass @xmath59 . given the uncertainties in the involved nuclear matrix elements the heidelberg - moscow result leads to a mass of @xmath60 ev .",
    "if this is true then the mass eigenstates are necessarily degenerate , and @xmath61 .",
    "taking the wmap result of @xmath62 ev at face value seems to be inconsistent with the heidelberg - moscow result @xcite .",
    "however , already if ly-@xmath63 forest data and a constraint on the bias parameter is not used in the analysis the upper bound of @xmath48 ev is still consistent .",
    "for this reason it is probably premature to rule out the claimed evidence for neutrinoless double beta decay .      for the case of the effective number of neutrino species we have in all cases calculated constraints in the @xmath64 plane , while marginalizing over all other parameters .",
    "the reason for this is that for big bang nucleosynthesis purposes these are exactly the important parameters .",
    "therefore , to combine cmb , lss , and bbn constraints the marginalization over @xmath65 should not be performed .",
