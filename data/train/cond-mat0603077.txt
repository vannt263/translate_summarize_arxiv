    "recent theoretical and simulation studies of ionic systems have improved our understanding of their structure and thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "one of the most successful and simplest ionic models is the restricted primitive model ( rpm ) , in which the ions are viewed as equisized hard spheres carrying positive and negative charges of the same magnitude .",
    "the rpm exhibits vapor - liquid phase separation and the corresponding critical point was confirmed to belong to the three - dimensional ising universality class  @xcite .    the discretized version of the rpm , the lattice restricted primitive model ( lrpm ) , has also been extensively studied by both simulation @xcite and theoretical approaches @xcite . in the lrpm ,",
    "positions of the positive and negative ions of diameter @xmath2 are restricted to the sites of an underlying simple cubic lattice of spacing @xmath3 ; the parameter @xmath4 specifies how closely the lattice system approaches the continuum behavior .",
    "in addition to the obvious computational advantages  @xcite , since the interactions between all lattice sites are pre - computed , the lattice model presents some unusual characteristics generally absent from non - ionic fluids  @xcite . for @xmath5 ,",
    "the most striking feature is an order - disorder transition  @xcite , which is not present in the continuous version of the rpm .",
    "there is no gas - liquid transition and the coexistence is between a low - density disordered phase and an antiferromagnetically ordered high - density phase .",
    "the transition is continuous ( nel - type line ) above and first - order below a tricritical point .",
    "however , for fine discretized lattices with @xmath6 the vapor - liquid coexistence is recovered and the critical point and coexistence curves converge to the values found in the continuum model for increasing values of @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "several investigations have been performed of the @xmath8 lrpm with additional short - range attractions  @xcite or nearest - neighbor ( nn ) repulsions  @xcite .",
    "these models present a rich phase behavior as the nn strength is varied . for weak or vanishing nn interactions only order - disorder transitions and a tricritical point",
    "were found , while for increasing nn strength different scenarios could be possible , depending on the magnitude of the nn interaction . for short - range attractions both tricritical and gas - liquid critical points can become stable  @xcite , while for nn repulsion the continuum - space behavior is recovered  @xcite .",
    "the present paper extends the previous study  @xcite , of the lrpm model with variable nearest neighbor repulsion to the limit of infinite repulsion .",
    "the model is thus the lattice restricted primitive model with nearest neighbor exclusion ( lrpm - nn ) .",
    "this is equivalent to a lattice restricted primitive model of discretization parameter @xmath9 .",
    "prior theoretical studies  @xcite with first , second and third nn exclusion indicate close similarity between the lrpm - nn phase diagram and the results for an off - lattice ionic system at high densities .",
    "of particular interest to the present work are possible connections between order - disorder transitions and lower density vapor - liquid transitions and high density transitions between charge - ordered and charge - disordered phases @xcite .",

    "multihistogram reweighting  @xcite techniques were used to analyze the simulation data . for the critical region we used mixed - field finite size scaling analysis proposed by bruce and wilding  @xcite , which accounts for the lack of symmetry between coexisting phases in fluids .",

    "the lower - density phase for the lprm - nn is a disordered fluid at lower temperatures but becomes increasingly solid - like at higher densities . near the end - point of the transition the coexisting phases are both solids with face - centered - cubic overall arrangement of the particles , if one ignores the ion charge .",

    "this behavior can be rationalized by considering that the presence of the underlying lattice greatly stabilizes the solid , thus shifting the fluid - solid transition to higher temperatures . by contrast , for systems with very short range interactions , it is the destabilization of the liquid phase that leads to the disappearance of the vapor - liquid transition . the phase diagram for the lrpm - nn model is similar to that of the lrpm with @xmath41 , obtained with large statistical uncertainties in ref .",
