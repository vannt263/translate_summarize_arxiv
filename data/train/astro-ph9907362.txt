    "the discovery of kilohertz quasiperiodic oscillations ( qpos ) in the low mass x - ray neutron star binaries ( strohmayer 1996 ; van der klis 1996 ) was followed by similar results for nineteen sources ( van der klis 1998 , strohmayer , swank and zhang 1998 ) . for most of them ,",
    "the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) mission showed the persistence of twin peaks in the spectrum ( @xmath11 hz ) . in the lower part of the spectrum of sco x-1 , van der klis ( 1997 ) found two branches @xmath12 and @xmath13 hz which correlate with the frequencies of the above - mentioned twin peaks .",
    "the nature of the twin peaks has been discussed intensively .",
    "the apparent constancy of the difference @xmath14 for the twin peaks in some sources led to the beat - frequency interpretation ( a concept originated by alpar and shaham 1985 ) .",
    "below , we describe difficulties of this model following the recent assessment by mendez and van der klis ( 1999 ) . within the beat - frequency model , the higher peak in the khz range is identified with the keplerian frequency ( van der klis 1996 ) .",
    "the lower twin peak in this model occurs as a result of beating between the high peak and the spin frequency of the neutron star @xmath15 which is believed to be observed during type 1 x - ray bursts as @xmath16 ( or half that ) ( strohmayer 1996 , miller , lamb & psaltis 1998 ) . within the original beat - frequency model , @xmath14 and @xmath15",
    "should remain constant .",
    "the observed @xmath17 variation of @xmath14 ( van der klis 1997 , mendez 1998 , ford 1998 , mendez & van der klis 1999 ) undermined the beat - frequency interpretation .",
    "convincingly , mendez and van der klis ( 1999 ) showed that for atoll source 4u 1728 - 34 , @xmath14 is not equal to @xmath16 even for the lowest inferred mass accretion rate . in their words , this seems to rule out the simple beat - frequency interpretation of the khz qpos in lmxbs and some of the modifications introduced to explain the results of a variable @xmath14 .",
    "a completely different paradigm has been proposed by osherovich and titarchuk ( 1999 ) and by titarchuk and osherovich ( 1999 ) ( hereafter ot99 and to99 , respectively ) to explain qpos in neutron stars .",
    "the new model is based on the idea that the twin peaks occur as a result of the coriolis force imposed on a one - dimensional keplerian oscillator .",
    "the second section of our letter contains the assumptions and predictions of the model .",
    "verification of the predictions concerning the low frequency branch for the source 4u 1702 - 42 is presented in section 3 .",
    "discussion and summary follow in the last section .",
    "the following assumptions constitute our model ( ot99 and to99 ) :    \\a ) the lower frequency of the twin khz qpo is the keplerian frequency @xmath18 where g is the gravitational constant , m is the mass of the neutron star and r is the radius of the corresponding keplerian orbit .",
    "\\b ) there is a boundary layer : transition region between the ns surface and the first keplerian orbit . within this layer , the radial viscous oscillations @xmath19 are maintained .",
    "there is also a diffusive propagation process of the perturbations generated in this layer and characterized by a break frequency @xmath20 related to @xmath19 . outside of this layer ,",
    "the disk has keplerian radial oscillations with @xmath2 ( see also titarchuk , lapidus & muslimov 1998 ) .",
    "\\c ) the magnetosphere which surrounds the neutron star has a rotational frequency @xmath21 which is not perpendicular to the disk .",
    "\\d ) inhomogeneities ( hot blobs ) thrown into the vicinity of the disk participate in the radial keplerian oscillations but simultaneously are subjected to the coriolis force associated with the differential rotation of the magnetosphere .",
    "the consequences of the model are straightforward .",
    "the problem of a linear oscillator in the frame of reference rotating with rotational frequency @xmath21 is known to have an exact solution describing two branches of oscillations @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath6 is the angle between @xmath21 and the plane of the keplerian oscillations .",
    "formulas ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are derived under the assumption of small @xmath6 ( ot99 and references therein ) .",
    "thus , the high frequency of the observed twin khz peaks has been interpreted as the upper hybrid frequency @xmath1 or the frequency of the high branch of the keplerian oscillator under the influence of the coriolis force associated with magnetospheric rotation .",
    "the existence of the lower branch ( @xmath9 ) is a prediction of the model .",
    "oscillations @xmath24 hz and 90 hz in sco x-1 reported by van der klis ( 1997 ) are found to fit formula ( 3 ) for @xmath25 when interpreted as 1st and 2nd harmonics of @xmath9 ( ot99 , to99 ) . in the low part of qpo spectra according to to99 there are two more frequencies ( namely the break frequency @xmath20 and frequency of viscous oscillations @xmath19 ) related to each other @xmath26 we now consider the application of our model to source 4u 1702 - 42 studied in detail by markwardt , strohmayer & swank ( 1999 ) .",
    "for sco x-1 , we have shown that the solid body rotation @xmath27 is a reasonable first order approximation ( ot99 ) .",
    "theoretically , @xmath4 depends on the magnetic structure of the neutron star s magnetosphere . within the second order approximation",
    ", the @xmath4 profile has a slow variation as a function of @xmath2 , which we modeled for sco x-1 and for the source 4u 1608 - 52 in ot99 . for the source 4u 1702 - 42 , there are not enough simultaneous measurements of @xmath1 and @xmath2 to reconstruct the @xmath4 profile .",
    "thus , we restrict ourselves to the first order approximation and adopt @xmath28 hz , found in ot99 .",
    "the observed @xmath2 and @xmath1 used in ot99 for the calculation of @xmath29 according to formula ( 2 ) are presented in table 1 which contains the data kindly provided by c. markwardt .",
    "then from formulas ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) we have the expression for @xmath6 , namely @xmath30\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the observed keplerian frequency ( the second from the top khz qpo ) and @xmath9 is the alleged frequency of the low keplerian branch . within the first order approximation",
    ", the angle @xmath6 should stay the same for all @xmath2 , since @xmath6 is effectively the angle between the equatorial plane of the disk and the plane of the magnetic equator .",
    "the first two columns of table 2 present frequencies observed by markwardt ( 1999 ) for the source 4u 1702 - 42 with the corresponding date of the measurements .",
    "these two columns repeat the first two columns of the table in markwardt ( 1999 ) with the addition of data for july 30 , 1997 taken from the text of the same paper . in the third column of our table 2",
    ", we give our theoretical interpretation for the observed frequency peaks : k stands for the keplerian frequency , l for the frequency of the lower branch of the keplerian frequency , b for the break frequency . according to to99 , the relation between the frequency of viscous oscillations @xmath19 ( symbol v in our table ) and frequency @xmath20 ( eq .",
    "4 ) including equation ( 5 ) will serve as a tool for the identification of @xmath20 and @xmath19 .",
    "the last column of table 2 contains @xmath1 calculated according to formula ( 2 ) with @xmath31 hz and also the angle @xmath6 ( calculated according to formula ( 5 ) for those cases when @xmath2 and @xmath9 are measured simultaneously ) .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath6 are shown in figure 1 .",
    "indeed , the angle @xmath6 shows little variation with @xmath2 and as expected is rather small @xmath32 with knowledge of @xmath6 for the source 4u 1702 - 42 , we attempted to interpret the remaining observed frequencies in table 2 . for july 26.60 - 26.93 ,",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath1 are not present .",
    "three frequencies 10.8 , 32.5 and 80.1 hz were observed on this day . if 32.5 hz should be the @xmath9 then the second harmonic @xmath33 hz .",
    "but instead we have 80.1 hz , which is significantly higher than the expected @xmath34 . on the other hand , from the classification figure 4 presented in to99 , we know that in the vicinity of @xmath35 hz , the two frequencies @xmath9 and @xmath19 may come close to one another . thus assuming that @xmath36 hz , we find that @xmath37 hz satisfies the theoretical relation ( 4 ) within the observational errors .",
    "we identify @xmath38 hz and also @xmath39 hz for july 21 and @xmath40 hz for the same day . from formula ( 3 )",
    "we derive @xmath2 for both cases assuming the fixed @xmath6 and @xmath41 hz .",
    "this identification holds best for @xmath42 which is the angle derived for @xmath43 hz and @xmath44 hz on july 30 ( see the last line of table 2 ) .",
    "the consistency of our identification is shown in figure 2 where @xmath1 , @xmath9 , @xmath34 and @xmath20 are plotted as functions of @xmath2 ( solid lines are theoretical ) .",
    "figure 2 shows that as expected @xmath45 decreases as @xmath2 increases . with the small number of observational points , the theoretical curves in figure 2 are , in fact , a prediction of our model which can be viewed as a challenge for those observers who choose to extend the observational base for the source 4u 1702 - 42 to verify our model .",
    "it is possible that the difference between @xmath46 and observed @xmath47 is attributed to @xmath48assumption .",
    "further measurement of @xmath1 and @xmath2 shall allow to reconstruct the @xmath49profile and improve our predicative capability .",
    "our model ( ot99 and to99 ) reveals the physical nature of @xmath8 hz oscillations in the source 4u 1702 - 42 . as a low keplerian branch of oscillations in the rotating frame of reference",
    ", this phenomenon should have an observational invariant - namely the angle @xmath6 . within the first order approximation this angle can be viewed as a global parameter describing the inclination of the magnetospheric equator to the equatorial plane of the disk .",
    "measured locally for different radial distances ( therefore different @xmath2 ) , @xmath6 may vary considerably unless indeed the observed oscillations correspond to the predicted low keplerian branch .",
    "the constancy of @xmath6 shown in figure 1 allows us to interpret the @xmath8 hz oscillations as the low branch described by equation ( 3 ) .",
    "knowledge of the angle @xmath6 is essential for the classification of the qpo resonances and the understanding of the physical nature of this phenomenon .",
    "the parameter @xmath6 is critical in evaluating the differences between the spectra of different sources . for sco x-1 , oscillations with frequency @xmath24 hz",
    "are identified as belonging to the @xmath9 branch ( ot99 ) .",
    "the higher observed frequencies of the @xmath9 for sco x-1 are mainly a result of a larger angle @xmath50 .",
    "we believe that the angle @xmath6 as a fundamental geometric parameter of the neutron star magnetosphere will be found eventually for other sources with khz qpo .",
    "the source 4u 1702 - 42 is the second source for which @xmath6 has been inferred ."
