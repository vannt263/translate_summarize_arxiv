    "epilayers of ga@xmath3in@xmath4n are indispensable elements of optoelectronic devices operating within green - blue range of electromagnetic radiation spectrum @xcite .",
    "introducing indium into the gan matrix leads to a narrowing of the energy gap of the material from 3.5 to 1.9 ev and makes it possible to tune the energy of light emitted by the device .",
    "the perspective of promising applications together with interesting physical phenomena governing the radiative recombination efficiency have stimulated intensive investigations of this material .",
    "detailed information about the electronic structure is important for both applications and research of elementary excitations in it . to get information about electronic band structure we must use experimental methods which enable direct probing of electronic states . despite its surface sensitivity photoemission",
    "is widely accepted as one of the most suitable tools for such studies .",
    "however , atomically clean , ordered surfaces with unmodified chemical composition are a precondition for meaningful photoemission experiments .",
    "since ga@xmath3in@xmath4n is only available in the form of epitaxial layers grown by molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) or metal organic chemical vapor deposition ( mocvd ) , surfaces for photoemission studies can not be obtained by cleavage under uhv conditions . instead , uhv - compatible methods consisting in ar@xmath10 ion sputtering and annealing have to be considered .",
    "they have been applied in various combinations in order to prepare surfaces of gan epilayers for electronic structure studies @xcite .",
    "such procedures led to clean , well ordered ( 0001)-(1x1 ) surfaces , suitable for band structure studies by means of angle - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy .",
    "however , it was found for indium containing nitride layers that the presence of in atoms modifies surface structure ( for the ( 0001 ) orientation , particularly ) @xcite , by formation of indium - rich surface nanostructures @xcite or by inducing non - uniform depth distribution of constituent elements @xcite .",
    "moreover , surface sputtering of multicomponent solid may lead to a substantial change in chemical composition of the subsurface layer .",
    "the extent of that effect has to be evaluated experimentally before studies of the band structure are undertaken . due to such obstacles , experimental evidence concerning",
    "band structure of ga@xmath3in@xmath4n is scarce , except of that referred to the edges of the bands forming the fundamental energy gap , which were obtained mainly by various optical measurements @xcite .",
    "the bowing of band gap vs composition dependence in strained and relaxed layers of ga@xmath3in@xmath4n was one of the main issues in those papers .",
    "conclusions derived from the experiments were supported by theoretical calculations @xcite . the density of states in the whole valence and conduction bands was investigated by soft x - ray emission and absorption @xcite .",
    "changes of the band structure as a function of indium content were reported , in particular for the top of the valence band , in the alloys with a degree of substitution lower than 0.1 .",
    "the conclusions from that study will be taken into account in the analysis of our photoemission results .",
    "some results of photoemission experiments on inn have also been reported @xcite .    in this paper , we report photoemission investigations of properties of mocvd - grown ga@xmath3in@xmath4n .",
    "the first part presents the x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) study of this material subjected to ar@xmath2 ion sputtering .",

    "the sample surface was prepared by ar@xmath2 ion sputtering , followed by annealing at 600@xmath11c .",
    "normal emission spectra acquired for photon energies from 26 to 76 ev enabled us to map the valence band structure along the @xmath12-a direction of the brillouin zone .",

    "comparison of our results with those derived from theoretical calculations of ga@xmath3in@xmath4n valence band density of states @xcite supports the assignment of the above feature to the presence of indium ions in the studied system .",
    "the investigated samples were prepared in the high pressure research centre , polish academy of sciences in warsaw , poland .",

    "the angle - resolved ( ar ) photoemission experiments were carried out at beamline 41 of the max - lab synchrotron radiation laboratory in lund , sweden .",

    "the core - level spectra of the ga@xmath15in@xmath4n components ( in 3d , ga 3p , n 1s ) and of the main surface contaminants ( o 1s and c 1s ) were acquired , after sequential sputtering steps .",

    ", the area was measured under a single gaussian extracted from the feature consisting of n 1s and gamnn .",
    "the intensities were normalized to experimental conditions ( number of scans , acquisition time etc . ) and atomic sensitivity factors .",
    "for all three core levels we observed an increase of intensity after the first stage of sputtering ( fig .",
    "[ trends]a ) .",
    "it was strongest for ga 3d and relatively weak for in .",
    "further sputtering did not lead to intensity changes , within the accuracy of our analysis . as a consequence , the intensity ratio in / ga decreased from 0.17 ( prior to sputtering ) to the saturation level of 0.11 after 45 min .",
    "sputtering time ( fig .  [ trends]b ) .",
    "the latter value corresponds to the composition parameter x equal to 0.1 and remains reasonably consistent with its real value of 0.08 .",
    "the observed change could be related to the reported non - uniform depth - compositional distribution in ga@xmath3in@xmath4n layers grown by mocvd @xcite .",
    "the n/(in+ga ) ratio also decreased after the first sputtering , most probably due to partial deficiency of nitrogen at the surface ( induced by sputtering ) .",
    "generally , this ratio is reasonably close to expected value of 1 .",
    "a surface contribution of metal atoms , appearing due to sputtering , could easily be observed for ga 3d at photon energies of 40 - 60 ev for @xmath21 @xcite as well as ( 0001 ) surface .",
    "such a component could not be discerned in the reported xps spectra .",
    "it can be attributed to lower energy resolution and markedly higher electron escape depth for x - rays .",
    "the measurement and analysis of the o 1s and c 1s spectra showed that ar@xmath10 ion sputtering efficiently removes these elements from the sample surface .",
    "the most significant decrease of their content was observed after the first stage of sputtering ( i.e. after 45 min .",
    "of ar@xmath10 exposure ) .",
    "for the `` as mounted '' surface , the o 1s feature could be decomposed into two maxima centered at 531.2 and 533.4 ev . according to watkins _",
    "_ @xcite the o 1s peak component at higher be correspond to oxygen atoms adsorbed at the surface of gan ; the other one  to oxygen bound in the bulk of the crystal .",
    "we found that ar@xmath10 ion cleaning leaves a trace amount of oxygen and carbon in the surface layer probed by xps .",
    "this coincides with the results of prabhakaran _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for surface of gan .",
    "they attributed the residual c 1s emission to carbon atoms incorporated into the epilayer during its growth .    concluding the analysis of cleaning the layer by ar@xmath10 sputtering , one has to note that surface contaminants are removed efficiently and the energy positions of the core level peaks change toward lower",
    "be due to removal of oxidized surface layer .",
    "however , the shape of ga 3p , in 3d and n 1s peaks do not change during sputtering ( no oxide - related components can be unequivocally revealed ) .",
    "the surface morphology of the investigated samples was also studied by atomic force microscopy ( afm ) . a comparison of the patterns obtained before and after sputtering showed that such a process did not lead to marked destruction of the surface or to increase of its roughness .",
    "however , structures with step height of 1 or 1.5 nm and horizontal width of about 300 nm became discernible on the sputtered surface .",
    "the step height corresponds roughly to 2 - 3 lattice parameters along the _ c _ axis .    in conclusion",
    "we can state that ar@xmath10 ion bombardment does not change the chemical composition of the surface and subsurface region of ga@xmath3in@xmath4n layers markedly .",
    "simultaneously , the sputtering provides significant reduction of oxygen and carbon concentration down to the level , where they do not influence the core ",
    "level spectra of ga , in and n ( see figs .  [ gainn ] ) .",
    "thus , x - ray photoemission spectroscopy shows that ar@xmath10 ion bombardment can be used as a uhv - compatible method for preparation of clean ga@xmath3in@xmath4n surfaces for photoemission experiments .",
    "taking into account the results reported in the previous subsection we undertook an attempt to study band structure of ga@xmath3in@xmath4n epitaxial layer cleaned in situ by multiple cycles of ar@xmath10 ion sputtering and annealing at 600@xmath11c under uhv conditions .",
    "the most important aim of the study was assessment of in - related changes in the band structure of the solid solution .",
    "therefore , parallel measurements were carried out for samples of ga@xmath0in@xmath1n and gan .",
    "the samples were fixed on the sample holder next to each other and cleaned together .",
    "so , the surface preparation , as well as the experimental conditions , were identical for both samples .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]     the crystallinity of the surfaces was checked using low energy electron diffraction ( leed ) method .",
    "the leed patterns indicated a hexagonal ( 1x1 ) symmetry of the surface for gan as well as for ga@xmath3in@xmath4n ( fig .",
    "[ leed ] ) .",
    "the surface composition of both samples was checked during the preparation process by spectroscopy of the ga  3d level .",
    "results of previous investigation concerning preparation of gan(0001 ) ( ga - polar ) surface by ar@xmath22 ion bombardment and annealing showed that any changes in the surface conditions clearly manifested themselves in shape and position of ga 3d structure .",
    "sputtering efficiently removed oxidized ga  it resulted in disappearance of relevant component of ga 3d feature ( observed for `` as grown '' sample ) .",
    "hence , after sputtering the ga  3d feature was centered at the be corresponding to pure gallium .",
    "annealing of the sputtered sample resulted in decrease of the contribution related to pure gallium and appearance of the peak of ga bound to n. these changes were clearly correlated with sharpening of the leed pattern .",
    "such a preparation procedure resulted in the clean , ordered gan(0001)-(1x1 ) surface suitable for angle - resolved photoemission study @xcite .",
    "thus , the progress in the cleaning the surface during the sample treatment in this work was monitored by the observation of similar changes in the ga 3d feature .",
    "angle - resolved photoemission was applied to study the electronic band structure along the @xmath23-a direction in the brillouin zone .",
    "making use of synchrotron radiation we were able to measure the photoemission spectra for the energy range of 26 - 80 ev .",
    "sets of normal emission spectra were acquired for ga@xmath0in@xmath1n(0001)-(1x1 ) and for the corresponding surface of gan ( fig .",
    "[ edcnorm ] ) .",
    "a shirley - type background was subtracted from the spectra .",
    "the origin of the be scale has been adjusted to the valence band maximum ( as determined for gan from the experimental band structure diagram ( fig .",
    "[ bands ] ) ) .",
    "the fermi level position in the samples was around the edge of the conduction band , as estimated by photoemission measurement for a metallic reference sample in electric contact with investigated layers .",
    "this justifies excluding relation between features revealed at the valence band edge of ga@xmath0in@xmath1n and appearance of any metal layer or islands on the sample surface .",
    "angle - resolved photoemission spectra taken at normal emission from the gan  ( 0001 ) and ga@xmath0in@xmath1n  ( 0001 ) surfaces .",
    "ticks show the features discerned in the spectra and used to draw the experimental band structure diagram .",
    "triangles mark features corresponding to emission from in - related states at the valence band maximum ( see fig .",
    "[ bands]).,height=325 ]    the overall shape of the spectra seems reasonably similar to those previously reported for gan ( 0001 ) surfaces @xcite , taking into account differences between results obtained by various groups .",
    "certain discrepancies should be attributed to modifications of surface preparation procedures .",
    "irrespectively of differences in relative heights of the features , the spectra consist of two main groups of maxima .",
    "the first one , ranging from the valence band maximum to the be of about 4 ev corresponds mainly to emission from the top valence bands .",
    "the second part of the curves is dominated by two features with weak dispersion ( at be of 5 - 6 ev and about 8 ev ) and emission from the deeper valence band @xcite .",
    "the corresponding spectra collected for gan and ga@xmath0in@xmath1n are generally similar",
    ". however , a clearly discernible feature appears at the leading edge of the spectra of in - containing layer for higher photon energies ( 5876 ev ) .",
    "this feature overlaps with a weaker shoulder appearing for gan at slightly higher binding energies . a similar ,",
    "although weaker , modification can also be resolved for the spectra recorded for the lowest photon energies .",
    "two weak features could be revealed for the energies above the valence band maximum  at -2.0 and -3.4 ev for gan , at -2.4 and -3.4 ev for ga@xmath0in@xmath1n .",
    "it was shown by wang _",
    "_ @xcite that electronic states occur in the energy gap on the ( 0001)-(1x1 ) surface .",
    "however , it is difficult to relate our findings with the results of their calculation due to well known difficulty in determining of energy gap by dft - lda calculations .",
    "the energy position of the second feature coincides well with the width of gan energy gap .",
    "the presence of such emission , although weak , may suggest strong band bending downwards and formation of an inversion layer at the surface of the samples .",
    "these features need and seem to deserve more detailed investigation .    in order to gain insight into details of the band structure of both systems",
    "the sets of photoemission spectra measured for normal emission were transformed into a band structure diagram along the @xmath23 -a direction ( fig .  [ bands ] ) .",
    "features appearing in the spectra were revealed and their energy positions were determined by means of an inverted second derivative method ( marked with ticks and triangles in fig .  [ edcnorm ] ) . those be values were used as the input data for calculation of corresponding k - vectors . we applied the free - electron final - state model using the formula :    @xmath24    the value for inner potential of the crystal v@xmath25=15.5 ev",
    "was determined by analysis of the curvature of the experimental bands and their correspondence to the available calculated band structure parameters of gan . for almost all points ,",

    "a comparison of the experimental band diagrams of both materials shows that the main modification of the band structure brought about by the admixture of in is an additional feature at the energy of 0.2 ev ( marked with solid triangles ) .",
    "it led to an upward shift of the valence band edge of ga@xmath0in@xmath1n .",
    "a similar effect was observed by x - ray absorption @xcite .",
    "a shift of the valence band maximum by 0.15 ev was observed in n 2p soft x - ray emission spectra between gan and ga@xmath31in@xmath32n .",
    "_ found it in agreement with results of empirical pseudopotential calculations of in wave functions and energy gap behavior in low - in content ga@xmath3in@xmath4n .",
    "@xcite showed that the hole wave function localized around in could be interpreted as a combination of hybridized in functions with those of gan valence band .",
    "such a localization of states occurred above as well as below the valence band maximum of gan .",
    "our observation is also consistent with the results of first - principles calculations of band structure performed for gan and ga@xmath3in@xmath4n @xcite .",
    "the calculations showed that some p states of nitrogen are pushed up from the top of the valence band , due to hybridization of in states and states of gan .",
    "thus , it seems to be justified to ascribe the dispersionless feature revealed in the ga@xmath15in@xmath4n band structure to in(p , d)-n(p ) hybridization states . it can easily be discerned in fig .",
    "[ comp ] , where the differences between the spectra recorded for @xmath19= 69 ev were visualized by direct comparison .",
    "the difference at the energy of 1.5 ev overlaps with bulk valence bands and can not be discerned in the experimental band structure diagrams .",
    "dispersionless features discernible in the experimental band structures of gan and ga@xmath3in@xmath4n can be related to surface states or to non - direct emission from high density - of - states regions in the brillouin zone . according to wang _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , a surface band occurs just below the lowest valence band .",
    "its energy at the @xmath23 point is equal to 8 ev ( with respect to the valence band maximum ) .",
    "such a surface band is characteristic of the gan(0001)-(1x1 ) surface terminated by additional layer of ga atoms bound at @xmath33 positions .",
    "emission from that state may contribute to the feature found at about 8 ev for both materials .",
    "however , one has to take into account the possibility of `` non - direct '' emission from the lowest part of the valence band .",
    "similarly , the feature at 4 ev can be connected with a surface band occurring around the @xmath23 point on a clean ga - terminated ( 0001 ) surface , but again emission from high density of states region may be important . for the feature at 6 ev , we can consider a surface band between the k and m points of the surface brillouin zone @xcite and emission from bulk band at the k point .",
    "the formation of ga@xmath3in@xmath4n(0001 ) surface by ar ion sputtering was investigated by x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy .",
    "the intensities of the peaks related to emission from the ga@xmath3in@xmath4n layer constituent elements ( ga , in , n ) were measured for the sample `` as - mounted '' and after subsequent stages of sputtering . for sputtering with ar@xmath22 ions having relatively low kinetic energy ( 600 ev ) no substantial modification of in / ga ratio was observed , except for a weak change in chemical composition at the initial stage of sputtering .",
    "the main contaminants ( oxygen and carbon ) were efficiently removed from the surface .",
    "therefore , we believe that argon ion sputtering can be used as a uhv - compatible method for preparation of clean ga@xmath3in@xmath4n surfaces for photoemission experiments .    comparative studies of the ( 0001)-(1x1 ) surfaces of ga@xmath0in@xmath1n and gan layers have been performed by angle - resolved photoemission in order to derive their band structure .",
    "the experimental band structures have been mapped along the @xmath23-a direction of the brillouin zone .",
    "an additional dispersionless feature at the valence band maximum has been observed for ga@xmath0in@xmath1n .",
