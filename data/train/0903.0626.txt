    "it is known empirically since the introduction of quantum hypothesis by planck that thermal boltzmann - gibbs distribution works extremely well for quantum systems .",
    "however , purely quantum derivation of this distribution is still not on a satisfactory ground . in a self - contained derivation one should be able to start from a large isolated system and then obtain the statistical distribution for a small subsystem .",
    "the conventional derivation of the boltzmann - gibbs distribution proceeds by postulating the micro - canonical condition .",
    "this condition has different status in classical and quantum mechanics . in classical mechanics",
    "the micro - canonical condition rests on the further assumption of equipartition on the constant energy shell in the phase space , which in turn can be justified by the dynamical chaos caused by the non - linear interactions between particles . in this respect ,",
    "the classical derivation is in better shape .",
    "in contrast , the quantum systems have no phase space , and also they are fundamentally linear .",
    "a typical state of an isolated quantum system is not an eigenstate but a superposition of eigenstates : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the wave function of the superposition , @xmath2 is the wave function of the @xmath3-th eigenstate , @xmath4 the corresponding complex amplitude , and @xmath5 the total number of eigenstates .",
    "therefore , the straightforward counterpart of the classical microcanonical condition would be to constrain the possible choices of @xmath1 to the `` energy shell '' in the hilbert space : @xmath6 where @xmath7 are the occupation numbers of quantum states and @xmath8 is the energy of the quantum superposition set externally and referred to below as `` average energy . ''",
    "condition ( [ epsav ] ) is , however , different from the conventional microcanonical condition , because the latter involves the summation only over the eigenstates inside a very small energy window @xmath9 .",
    "why the system should limit itself to a small energy window is difficult to justify unless , for example , one assumes that the quantum system is subjected to an external source of decoherence with the subsequent collapse of the density matrix .",
    "however , the introduction of collapse would imply that non - relativistic quantum mechanics is not self - contained , when it comes to justifying the boltzmann - gibbs equilibrium .    besides the conceptual issues , there are also practical ones . when a well isolated quantum system having not too many particles but many quantum levels is shaken in an experiment and then left to itself , the energy window of the participating eigenstates",
    "can easily become larger than the temperature .",
    "would such a system end up exhibiting boltzmann - gibbs statistics ?",
    "it is clear _ a priori _ , that a significant departure from the narrow - energy - window constraint can easily lead to deviations from the boltzmann - gibbs statistics@xcite .",
    "one can , consider , for example the case of two narrow energy windows .",
    "still one can hope that somehow the `` most probable departure '' from the narrow energy window condition would still support the boltzmann - gibbs equilibrium .",
    "if one is to begin addressing the above issues , the unavoidable limit to consider is the system of @xmath10 quantum levels with constraint ( [ epsav ] ) and no limit on the energy window , i.e. all quantum superpositions of form ( [ psi ] ) satisfying condition ( [ epsav ] ) are equally probable and , therefore , the probability density as a function of the complex amplitudes @xmath4 is proportional to the volume element on a manifold in the hilbert space constrained by eq.([epsav ] ) .",
    "following ref.@xcite , i call this condition `` quantum micro - canonical '' ( qmc ) to contrast it with the conventional micro - canonical condition",
    ".    the general approach of assigning the probability on the basis of volume in hilbert space has received a good degree of attention in recent years .",
    "some of the relevant works@xcite applied this approach to the conventional micro - canonical case with small energy window for the participating eigenstates .",
    "other works@xcite , however , have looked precisely at the qmc alternative .",
    "in particular , it was found in ref.@xcite for the case of equally spaced levels ( and confirmed in the present work for the general case ) that , as @xmath11 , the volume of the hilbert space as function of @xmath8 acquires the character of a @xmath12-function with peak located at @xmath13 . this result , however , does not imply that it is not important to consider the case of @xmath8 different from the above value .",
    "the situation here is analogous to the conventional micro - canonical description , when the most probable position of the narrow energy window would correspond to the infinite temperature , but one would still like to know the result for a finite temperature .",
    "the goal of the present work is to obtain from the qmc condition the statistics for the occupation numbers of individual quantum states both for the entire isolated quantum system ( section  [ whole ] ) , and for the density matrix of a small part of it ( section  [ subsystem ] ) .",
    "it is to be shown analytically that this statistics is dramatically different from the boltzmann - gibbs statistics : the occupation numbers of quantum states decay with energy algebraically rather than exponentially , and , in addition , the macroscopic limit is routinely accompanied by condensation into the lowest energy state .",
    "section  [ numerical ] contains preliminary numerical tests of some of the above analytical results for finite systems .",
    "this section also reports a numerical finding that the expansion of the basis states of large but finite random matrix hamiltonians in terms of the eigenstates of these hamiltonians obeys the statistics found in this work .",
    "the implications of the above results are to be discussed in the concluding remarks(section  [ concluding ] ) .",
    "the notion of chaos does not play any role in the forthcoming derivation , but it will also be touched briefly in the concluding remarks .    even though the formal treatment below is based essentially on the geometrical analysis of many - dimensional manifolds , it should not escape the readers that the end result is similar to the boltzmann - gibbs distribution for grand canonical ensemble  though not for the average values of the occupation numbers @xmath14 , which the boltzmann - gibbs distribution aims at predicting , but rather for the probabilities of variable @xmath15 to admit different values .",
    "in other words , it is an example of superstatistics@xcite  consequence of the fact that the occupation numbers @xmath15 , which are interpreted as quantum probabilities , are themselves subject to the probability distribution .",
    "the hilbert space is parameterizable by the absolute values @xmath16 and the phases @xmath17 of the complex amplitudes @xmath18 . without the energy and the normalization constraints , the volume element in this space",
    "is given by @xmath19 .",
    "both energy and the normalization constraints involve only @xmath20 , and , therefore , when assigning the probabilities in the hilbert space , one can integrate over phases @xmath17 and then deal only with the subspace of occupation numbers @xmath21 the hilbert space volume element is then given by @xmath22 with an unimportant prefactor .",

    "namely , @xmath8 in the right - hand side of eq.([epsav ] ) has to be multiplied by @xmath41 [ equal to 1 according to ( [ norm ] ) ] and then the result transformed to eq.([epsavk0 ] ) .",
    "important for the subsequent derivation is the fact that energy hyperplane represented by eq.([epsavk0 ] ) crosses the origin of the @xmath35-space , when @xmath42 .",
    "the manifold @xmath38 has a character of @xmath43-dimensional polygon with flat faces , edges , etc .",

    "the probability distribution of @xmath36 is then , and the average value of @xmath36 is @xmath44      i first consider the case @xmath45 .",
    "the manifold constrained by conditions ( [ positiv ] , [ normk ] , [ epsavk0 ] ) can now be described as follows :    the intersection of ( [ positiv ] ) and ( [ normk ] ) is a many - dimensional analog of a tetrahedron .",
    "it has dimension @xmath46  equal to that of the normalization hyperplane ( [ normk ] ) with @xmath32 vertices located at the intersections of the @xmath32 axes of the @xmath35 space with the hyperplane ( [ normk ] ) , i.e. in the @xmath35-space , each of the vertices has coordinates of type @xmath47  all projections are zero , except for one , which is equal to @xmath48 .",
    "i call the resulting object `` hypertetrahedron '' .",
    "this hypertetrahedron is then cross - sected by the energy hyperplane ( [ epsavk0 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath36 is small , the renormalization of the volume @xmath37 with respect to @xmath49 can be decomposed into the `` normalization factor '' @xmath50 due to the non - zero value of @xmath36 in eq.([normk ] ) and the `` energy factor '' @xmath51 due to the non - zero value of @xmath36 in eq.([epsavk0 ] ) : @xmath52    the normalization factor is given exactly by @xmath53 for large or small @xmath36 .",
    "it is the consequence of the fact that the change of @xmath54 in the right - hand side of eq.([normk ] ) rescales the distance between any point of the hypertetrahedron and the origin of the @xmath35 space by factor @xmath54 . since the energy hyperplane ( [ epsavk0 ] ) passes through the origin ( at @xmath42 ) , each of the @xmath43 dimensions of the intersection manifold simply undergoes rescaling by factor @xmath54 thus leading to factor ( [ normfactor ] ) .",
