    "the non perturbative aspects of strong interaction are extremely difficult to treat analytically .",
    "most of our knowledge about the low energy limit of the strong force comes from lattice calculations . in this context , the ads / cft correspondence @xcite represents an attractive alternative to investigate non perturbative aspects of gauge theories .",
    "this duality connects the string theory amplitudes on asymptotically ads @xmath0 space - time into gauge invariant , local operators of a conformal field theory ( cft ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the notoriously complex strong - coupling regime of large-@xmath1 gauge theories can be approximated ( in low - curvature regions ) by weakly coupled and hence analytically treatable classical gravities .",
    "extensions of this idea to quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) either start from specific d - brane setups in ten- ( or five- ) dimensional supergravity @xcite and derive the corresponding gauge theory properties , or try to guess a suitable background and to improve it in bottom - up fashion by comparing the predictions to qcd data . the first bottom - up model ( hard wall ) developed by polchinsky and",
    "strassler @xcite shows that the conformal invariance of ads@xmath2 in the uv limit implements the counting rules which govern the scaling behavior of hard qcd scattering amplitudes .",
    "an infrared cutoff on the fifth dimension at the qcd scale @xmath3 gives the mass gap and a discrete hadron spectrum .",
    "this model reproduces a huge amount of hadron phenomenology@xcite .",
    "on the other hand it does not reproduce regge trajectories on the mass spectrum ( @xmath4 ) . to correct this shortcoming karch , katz ,",
    "son and stephanov developed the soft - wall model@xcite . in this approach the ads@xmath2 geometry",
    "is kept intact while an additional dilaton background field is responsible for the conformal symmetry breaking .",
    "this dilaton soft - wall model indeed generates linear regge trajectories @xmath5 for light - flavor mesons of spin @xmath6 and radial excitation @xmath7 .",
    "( regge behavior can alternatively be encoded via ir deformations of the ads@xmath2 metric @xcite . )",
    "however , the resulting vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the wilson loop in the dilaton soft wall model does not exhibit the area - law behavior which a linearly confining static quark - antiquark potential would generate .",
    "it happens because the model uses an ads metric which is not of a confining type by the wilson loop analysis @xcite .",
    "in addition the soft wall model background is not a solution of a dual classical gravity theory .",
    "therefore , one has to impose all gauge theory vacuum properties ( confinement , chiral symmetry breaking and condensates ) in an ad - hoc manner , and the desired connection to the dynamics of a qcd dual remains untouched @xcite .",
    "csaki and reece @xcite analyzed the solutions of a 5d dilaton - gravity einstein equations ( see also@xcite ) using the formalism of superpotential .",
    "their conclusion is that it would not be possible to solve those equations and obtain a linear confining background .",
    "they also suggest that it would be possible to get a solution by analyzing a tachyon - dilaton - graviton model .",
    "this idea was successfully implemented by batell and gherghetta @xcite .",
    "we took an alternative route and we showed@xcite that a linear confining background is possible as a solution of the dilaton - gravity coupled equations in a deformed ads model .",
    "it means that our solution allows to obtain a spectrum of high - spin mesons very close to regge trajectories for the lower excited states ( where we have experimental data ) and an exact linear regge trajectory for very high excitations .",
    "we solve self - consistently the dilaton - gravity model , i.e. , we adopt an active dilaton in contrast to the soft - wall model where a passive dilation was considered .",
    "our model belongs to the general class of `` improved ads / qcd theories '' proposed recently by grsoy , kiritsis and nitti @xcite .",
    "in this section we will make a review of the dynamical ads / qcd model as proposed by de paula , frederico , forkel and beyer @xcite .",
    "let s take the action for a five - dimensional gravity coupled to a dilaton field : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the newton constant in @xmath10 dimensions and @xmath11 is the scalar - field potential .",
    "we will be restricted to a metric family given by : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the minkowski metric .    minimizing the action we obtain the coupled einstein equations @xmath14 see that we can determine the dilaton field directly from the metric model as : @xmath15 where we choose the positive sign for the root without loosing generality . substituting the dilaton field in equation ( [ einsteinzz ] )",
    "we obtain the dilaton potential as @xmath16 by solving the dilaton - gravity 5d einstein equations .",
    "as we have defined the dilaton - metric background of the model , we are now able to calculate the meson mass spectrum in the spirit of ads / qcd duality .",
    "to do so , we utilize the ads / cft dictionary in the sense that for each operator in the @xmath17d gauge theory there is a field propagating in the bulk . for definiteness",
    "we follow the notation of ref .",
    "the @xmath10d action for a gauge field @xmath18 of spin @xmath6 in the background is given by @xmath19 as in @xcite and @xcite , we utilize the axial gauge . to this end",
    ", we introduce new spin fields @xmath20 . in terms of this new field , the action is then given by @xmath21 using ( [ eqn : news ] ) the equation for the modes @xmath22 of the higher spin field @xmath23 is derived , viz .",
    "@xmath24 where @xmath25 . via the substitution @xmath26 ,",
    "one obtains a sturm - liouville equation @xmath27 where the @xmath28 dependent term in this equation may be interpreted as an effective potential for the string mode , written as @xmath29 hence , for each metric @xmath30 and dilaton field @xmath31 we get @xmath32 @xmath33 consistent with the solutions of the einstein equations . by solving the eigenvalue mode equation , we obtain a mass spectrum @xmath34 starting from the effective potential . due to the gauge / gravity duality this mass spectrum corresponds to the mesonic resonances in the @xmath17d space - time .      for scalars we can repeat the same derivation as we did in the last section except for the fact that for these mesons obviously we do not have to make any gauge choice . in particular scalar mesons",
    "were analyzed in @xcite .",
    "however , both works do not include the sigma .",
    "we start from the action @xcite where @xmath35 , that describes a scalar mode propagating in the dilaton - gravity background .",
    "we factorize in terms of the holographic coordinate @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "the string modes of the massive scalar field @xmath38 can be rewritten in terms of the reduced amplitudes @xmath39 which satisfy the sturm - liouville equation , as we have written before for the spin states .",
    "the scalar string - mode potential given by @xmath40with @xmath41 .",
    "the gauge / gravity dictionary identifies the eigenvalues @xmath42 with the squared meson mass spectrum of the boundary gauge theory .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence states that the wave function should behave as @xmath43 , where @xmath44 ( conformal dimension minus spin ) is the twist dimension for the corresponding interpolating operator that creates the given state configuration @xcite .",
    "the five - dimensional mass chosen as @xcite @xmath45 fixes the uv limit of the dual string amplitude with the twist dimension .",
    "in order to present an analytical view of confinement from the gravity model , as have been done in refs .",
    "@xcite , we will focus on a very simple polynomial metric , representing an ir deformation of ads metric : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a real parameter .",
    "our units are such that the @xmath48 radius is unity .",
    "the first term reflects the ads metric that dominates the uv limit .",
    "the second term is the leading one in the ir region and any subleading term is irrelevant for the present discussion of the regge trajectory for the high excited string states dual to mesons .",
    "the dilaton field is obtained by integrating eq .",
    "( [ constrain ] ) with the boundary condition @xmath49 .",
    "in particular one gets , for @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    the dilaton potential for @xmath55 is @xmath56 and for @xmath51 we obtain : @xmath57 which diverges exponentially reflecting the exponential form of the metric model . as an example , let us discuss the uv and ir properties of the effective potential for nonzero spin mesons . for small values of @xmath58 it can be easily expanded giving : @xmath59 which shows a spin dependence in all lower order terms . in the ir limit",
    "the metric ( [ polinomial_metric ] ) leads to the following effective potential @xmath60 which presents a discrete spectrum for the normalizable string modes if @xmath61 .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that the analysis of the effective potential gives a constraint for a confining metric consistent with the one found in the analysis of the wilson loop ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in our derivations we reduced the problem of modelling hadronic resonances by solving a sturm - liouville equation with a given potential ( [ vs ] or [ eqn : effp ] ) .",
    "the amazing point is that the effective potential depends only on the metric , which automatically constructs a self consistent dilaton - gravity background .",
    "therefore our modelling is at the level of proposing a metric ansatz that generates the experimental data available ( mass , decay constants , form factors , ... ) .",
    "in addition this metric has to satisfy the following conditions : i ) in the uv it has to become ads , because qccd is conformal in this limit and we have to recover the maldacena duality ; ii ) in the ir the warp factor has to have a polynomial power of @xmath62 , in order to have confinement by the wilson loop criteria and linear regge trajectories .",
    "our ansatz is : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a scale transformation that connects the gravity background in which different string modes dual propagate in the holographic coordinate . for scalars @xmath65 .",
    "to distinguish the pion states in our model , the fifth dimensional mass was rescaled according to @xmath66 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the constraints are the pion mass , the slope of the regge trajectory and the twist 2 from the operator @xmath67 .",
    "the results for the pion regge trajectory are shown in figure 2 for @xmath680.88 and @xmath69gev@xmath70 .",
    "for high - spin mesons we have an equation to obtain the scale factor @xmath71 ( in particular , see that in our previous work @xcite we also have the regge trajectories with a different metric ansatz ) . with the present metric ansatz",

    "the @xmath72 s partial decay width into @xmath73 are calculated from the overlap integral of the normalized string amplitudes ( sturm - liouville form ) in the holographic coordinate dual to the scalars @xmath74 and pion @xmath75 states , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a constant with dimension @xmath78 fitted to the experimental value of the @xmath79 partial decay width .",

    "we solved the dilaton - gravity coupled equations within a metric model and obtained a linear confining background for the string modes dual to mesons .",
    "we obtained a spectrum of the light - favored high - spin , scalar and pseudoscalar mesons in agreement with the experimental data .",
    "in addition we calculated the decay amplitude for the @xmath72 s into two pions to further check the consistency of the physical scales of the model , as this quantity is strongly sensitive to the relative size of the different mesons .",
    "in particular , the @xmath95 is identified with the first excitation of the string model dual to @xmath96 state ( see table i ) .",
    "we interpret this shift to a value above the experimental value , i.e. , 1.1 gev compared to 0.98 gev as due to a rescaling of the string mass as in the pion case , that also should be the case for the sigma . by increasing the excitation of the scalar meson this shift tends to decrease ( see @xmath84 in table i ) .",
    "we observed that the experimental value of @xmath97 for @xmath95 is too small compared to our result .",
    "this indicated that a strong mixing , e.g. , of @xmath98 with light non - strange quarks@xcite , should be present in the model . to account for that a mixing angle for @xmath95 of @xmath99",
    "was obtained from the partial width , and values between @xmath100 to @xmath101 fits @xmath102 within the experimental range .",
    "let us remind an interesting observation , that the string mode amplitude could be identified with the valence light - front wave function as pointed out by brodsky and de tramond @xcite .",
