    "in other cases , the choice of a heuristic scale leads to nonsensical physical results  @xcite or even negative cross sections at nlo  @xcite .",

    "[ figdirectproton ] .",
    "the fragmentation of a gluon or quark jet to a proton requires that the underlying 2 to 2 subprocess occurs at a higher transverse momentum than the @xmath2 of the observed proton because of the fast - falling quark - to - proton fragmentation function @xmath106 at high momentum fraction @xmath66 ; in contrast , the direct subprocess is maximally energy efficient .",
    "such  direct \" reactions thus can explain the fast - falling power - law falloff observed at fixed @xmath18 and fixed-@xmath107 at the isr , fermilab and rhic  @xcite .    since the proton is initially produced as a small - size @xmath108 color - singlet state , it is  color transparent \"  @xcite , and it can thus propagate through dense nuclear matter with minimal energy loss .",

    "a new understanding of nuclear shadowing and antishadowing has emerged based on multi - step coherent reactions involving leading twist diffractive reactions  @xcite .",
    "the nuclear shadowing of structure functions is a consequence of the lepton - nucleus collision ; it is not an intrinsic property of the nuclear wavefunction .",
    "the same analysis shows that antishadowing is _ not universal _ , but it depends in detail on the flavor of the quark or antiquark constituent  @xcite .",
    "detailed measurements of the nuclear dependence of individual quark structure functions are thus needed to establish the distinctive phenomenology of shadowing and antishadowing and to make the nutev results definitive .",
    "a comparison of the nuclear modification in neutrino versus anti - neutrino interactions is clearly important .",
    "there are other ways in which this new view of antishadowing can be tested ; for example , antishadowing can also depend on the target and beam polarization .",
    "the nontrivial effects from rescattering and diffraction highlight the need for a fundamental understanding the dynamics of hadrons in qcd at the amplitude level .",
    "this is essential for understanding phenomena such as the quantum mechanics of hadron formation , the remarkable effects of initial and final interactions , the origins of diffractive phenomena and single - spin asymmetries , and manifestations of higher - twist semi - exclusive hadron subprocesses .",
    "a central tool in these analyses is the light - front wavefunctions of hadrons , the frame - independent eigensolutions of the heisenberg equation for qcd   @xmath156 quantized at fixed light - front . given the light - front wavefunctions @xmath157 , one can compute a large range of exclusive and inclusive hadron observables .",
    "for example , the valence , sea - quark and gluon distributions are defined from the squares of the lfwfs summed over all fock states @xmath158 . form factors , exclusive weak transition amplitudes  @xcite such as @xmath159 and the generalized parton distributions  @xcite measured in deeply virtual compton scattering are ( assuming the  handbag \" approximation ) overlaps of the initial and final lfwfs with @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "it is thus important to distinguish  static \" structure functions which are computed directly from the light - front wavefunctions of a target hadron from the nonuniversal  dynamic \" empirical structure functions which take into account rescattering of the struck quark in deep inelastic lepton scattering .",
    "[ fignew17 ] .",
    "the real wavefunctions underlying static structure functions can not describe diffractive deep inelastic scattering nor single - spin asymmetries , since such phenomena involve the complex phase structure of the @xmath162 amplitude",
    ". one can augment the light - front wavefunctions with a gauge link corresponding to an external field created by the virtual photon @xmath135 pair current  @xcite , but such a gauge link is process dependent  @xcite , so the resulting augmented wavefunctions are not universal . @xcite .",
    "the physics of rescattering and nuclear shadowing is not included in the nuclear light - front wavefunctions , and a probabilistic interpretation of the nuclear dis cross section is precluded .",
    "intrinsic heavy quark distributions are a rigorous feature of qcd , arising from diagrams in which two or more gluons couple the valence quarks to the heavy quarks . the probability for fock states of a light hadron to have an extra heavy quark pair decreases as @xmath163 in non - abelian gauge theory  @xcite .",
    "the relevant matrix element is the cube of the qcd field strength @xmath164 in contrast to qed where the relevant operator is @xmath165 and the probability of intrinsic heavy leptons in an atomic state is suppressed as @xmath166 the maximum probability occurs at @xmath167 where @xmath168 ; _ i.e. _ , when the constituents have minimal invariant mass and equal rapidity .",
    "thus the heaviest constituents have the highest momentum fractions and the highest @xmath169 .",
    "intrinsic charm thus predicts that the charm structure function has support at large @xmath170 in excess of dglap extrapolations  @xcite ; this is in agreement with the emc measurements  @xcite .",
    "intrinsic charm can also explain the @xmath171 puzzle  @xcite .",
    "it also affects the extraction of suppressed ckm matrix elements in @xmath172 decays  @xcite .",
    "the dissociation of the intrinsic charm @xmath31 fock state of the proton can produce a leading heavy quarkonium state at high @xmath173 in @xmath174 since the @xmath175 and @xmath176 can readily coalesce into the charmonium state .",
    "since the constituents of a given intrinsic heavy - quark fock state tend to have the same rapidity , coalescence of multiple partons from the projectile fock state into charmed hadrons and mesons is also favored .",
    "for example , one can produce a leading @xmath177 at high @xmath36 and low @xmath2 from the coalescence of the @xmath178 constituents of the projectile @xmath31 fock state .",
    "production , width=680 ]    the operator product analysis of the ic matrix element shows that the ic fock state has a dominant color - octet structure : @xmath179 .",
    "the color octet @xmath180 converts to a color singlet by gluon exchange on the front surface of a nuclear target and then coalesces to a @xmath37 which interacts weakly through the nuclear volume  @xcite .",
    "thus the rate for the ic component has @xmath181 dependence corresponding to the area of the front surface .",
    "this is illustrated in fig [ fignew10 ] .",
    "this forward contribution is in addition to the @xmath182 contribution derived from the usual perturbative qcd fusion contribution at small @xmath4 because of these two components , the cross section violates perturbative qcd factorization for hard inclusive reactions  @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the two - component cross section for charmonium production observed by the na3 collaboration at cern  @xcite and more recent experiments  @xcite .",
    "the diffractive dissociation of the intrinsic charm fock state leads to leading charm hadron production and fast charmonium production in agreement with measurements  @xcite .",
    "the hadroproduction cross sections for double - charm @xmath183 baryons at selex  @xcite and the production of @xmath37 pairs at na3 are consistent with the diffractive dissociation and coalescence of double ic fock states  @xcite .",
    "these observations provide compelling evidence for the diffractive dissociation of complex off - shell fock states of the projectile and contradict the traditional view that sea quarks and gluons are always produced perturbatively via dglap evolution or gluon splitting .",
    "it is also conceivable that the observations  @xcite of @xmath184 at high @xmath36 at the isr in high energy @xmath185 collisions could be due to the dissociation and coalescence of the  intrinsic bottom \" @xmath186 fock states of the proton .     and @xmath187 in the rapidity regions @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "the uncertainties for the data include both statistical ( inner line ) and full uncertainties ( entire error bar ) .",

    "the scale uncertainties are shown as dotted lines and the pdf uncertainties by the shaded regions .",
    "the ratio of the standard cteq6.6 m prediction to two models of intrinsic charm is also shown . from the d0 collaboration  @xcite .",
    ", width=680 ]    as emphasized by lai , tung , and pumplin  @xcite , there are strong indications that the structure functions used to model charm and bottom quarks in the proton at large @xmath170 have been underestimated , since they ignore intrinsic heavy quark fluctuations of hadron wavefunctions . the anomalous growth of the @xmath190 inclusive cross section observed by d0 collaboration  @xcite at the tevatron and shown in fig .",
    "[ figratio ] also suggests that the charm distribution has been underestimated at @xmath191 beyond what is included in the cteq6.6 m pdfs .",
    "the neglect of the intrinsic - heavy quark component in the proton structure function will lead to an incorrect assessment of the gluon distribution at large @xmath1 if it is assumed that sea quarks always arise from gluon splitting .",
    "the intrinsic charm and bottom distributions at high @xmath1 in the proton structure functions also lead to novel heavy hadron production processes such as anomalous production of charm and bottom jets at high @xmath2 at the lhc , as well as novel mechanisms for higgs and @xmath3 production at high @xmath36  @xcite    it is astonishing that the original emc experiment which first observed a large signal for charm at large @xmath1 in 1983 has never been repeated .",
    "it is thus critical for experiments such as compass to definitively establish the phenomenology of the charm structure function at large @xmath192",
    "the vacuum in quantum field theories is remarkably simple in light - front quantization because of the restriction @xmath193 for example in qed , vacuum graphs such as @xmath194 which are normally associated with a zero - point energy do not arise in the light - front vacuum . in the higgs theory ,",
    "the usual higgs vacuum expectation value is replaced with a @xmath195 zero mode ;  @xcite however , the resulting phenomenology is identical to the standard analysis .",
    "the usual assumption that non - zero vacuum condensates exist and possess a measurable reality has long been recognized as posing a conundrum for the light - front formulation of qcd . in the light - front formulation of qcd , the ground - state is a structureless fock space vacuum , in which case it would seem to follow that dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( csb ) is impossible .",
    "in fact , as first argued by casher and susskind @xcite , dynamical csb must be a property of hadron wavefunctions , not of the vacuum .",
    "( they used an infinite momentum framework which is equivalent to the front - form . ) this thesis has also been explored in a series of recent articles @xcite .",
    "it is widely held that quark and gluon vacuum condensates have a physical existence , independent of hadrons , as measurable spacetime - independent configurations of qcd s elementary degrees - of - freedom in a hadron - less ground state .",
    "however , a non - zero spacetime - independent qcd vacuum condensate poses a critical dilemma for gravitational interactions , because it would lead to a cosmological constant some 45 orders of magnitude larger than observation . as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , this conflict is avoided if the strong interaction condensates are properties of the light - front wavefunctions of the hadrons , rather than the hadron - less ground state of qcd .",
    "conventionally , the quark and gluon condensates are considered to be properties of the qcd vacuum and hence to be constant throughout spacetime .",
    "a new perspective on the nature of qcd condensates @xmath196 and @xmath197 , particularly where they have spatial and temporal support , has recently been presented .",
    "@xcite the spatial support of condensates is restricted to the interior of hadrons , since condensates in qcd arise due to the interactions of quarks and gluons which are confined within hadrons .",
    "for example , consider a meson consisting of a light quark @xmath198 bound to a heavy antiquark , such as a @xmath172 meson .",
    "one can analyze the propagation of the light @xmath198 in the background field of the heavy @xmath199 quark . solving the dyson - schwinger equation for the light quark",
    "one obtains a nonzero dynamical mass and evidently a nonzero value of the condensate @xmath196 . but",
    "this is not a true vacuum expectation value ; in fact , it is the matrix element of the operator @xmath200 in the background field of the @xmath199 quark .",
    "the change in the ( dynamical ) mass of the light quark in a bound state is somewhat reminiscent of the energy shift of an electron in the lamb shift , in that both are consequences of the fermion being in a bound state rather than propagating freely .",
    "it is clearly important to use the equations of motion for confined quarks and gluon fields when analyzing current correlators in qcd , not free propagators , as has often been done in traditional analyses . since the distance between the quark and antiquark can not become arbitrarily large",
    ", one can not create a quark condensate which has uniform extent throughout the universe .",
    "thus in a fully self - consistent treatment of a qcd bound state , the condensate phenomenon occurs in the background field of the @xmath199-quark , whose influence on light - quark propagation is primarily concentrated in the far infrared and whose presence ensures the manifestations of light - quark dressing are gauge invariant .    in the case of the pion",
    ", one can show from the bethe - salpeter equation that the vacuum quark condensate that appears in the gell - mann - oakes - renner formula , is , in fact , a chiral - limit value of an ` in - pion ' condensate  @xcite .",
    "this condensate is no more a property of the `` vacuum '' than the pion s chiral - limit leptonic decay constant .",
    "one can connect the bethe - salpeter formalism to the light - front formalism , by fixing the light - front time @xmath201 .",
    "this then leads to the fock state expansion .",
    "in fact , dynamical csb in the light - front formulation , expressed via ` in - hadron ' condensates , can be shown to be connected with sea - quarks derived from higher fock states .",
    "this solution is similar to that discussed in ref .",
    "moreover , ref .",
    "@xcite establishes the equivalence of all three definitions of the vacuum quark condensate : a constant in the operator product expansion ,  @xcite via the banks - casher formula ,  @xcite and the trace of the chiral - limit dressed - quark propagator .",
    "i have reviewed a number of qcd topics where conventional wisdom relevant to hadronic physics at the lhc has been challenged .",
    "for example , the initial - state and final - state interactions of the quarks and gluons entering perturbative qcd hard - scattering subprocesses lead to the breakdown of traditional concepts of factorization and universality at leading twist .",
    "these soft - gluon rescattering , which are associated with the wilson line of the propagating partons , lead to bjorken - scaling single - spin asymmetries , diffractive deep inelastic scattering , the breakdown of the lam - tung leading twist relation in drell - yan reactions , as well as nuclear shadowing .",
    "furthermore , the gribov - glauber theory applied to the antishadowing domain predicts that nuclear structure functions are not universal , but instead depend on the flavor quantum numbers of each quark and antiquark , thus explaining the anomalous nuclear dependence recently observed in deep - inelastic neutrino scattering .",
    "surprisingly , isolated hadrons can be produced at large transverse momentum at a significant rate at the lhc directly within a hard higher - twist qcd subprocess , rather than from jet fragmentation .",
    "direct \" processes can explain the observed deviations from perturbative qcd predictions in measurements of inclusive hadron cross sections at fixed @xmath0 , as well as the  baryon anomaly \" , the anomalously large proton - to - pion ratio seen in high centrality heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the intrinsic charm contribution to the proton structure function at high @xmath1 can explain the anomalously large rate for high @xmath2 photon plus charm jet events observed by d0 at the tevatron .",
    "intrinsic charm and bottom distributions also imply anomalously large production of charm and bottom jets at high @xmath2 at the lhc , as well as a novel mechanism for higgs and @xmath3 production at high @xmath4    the correspondence between theories in a warped anti - de sitter space and light - front quantization in physical space - time is very powerful , and leads to much insight into qcd dynamics , including a nonperturbative qcd running coupling and a remarkably accurate relativistic lf schrodinger equation which reproduces much of light - quark spectroscopy and dynamics , using a soft - wall model of with a positive sign dilaton .",
    "other novel features of qcd have also been discussed , including the consequences of confinement for quark and gluon condensates and the implications for the qcd contribution to the cosmological constant .",
    "i have also emphasized that setting the renormalization scale of the qcd coupling using the scheme - independent blm method will greatly improve the precision of qcd predictions , and thus greatly increase the sensitivity of searches for new physics at the lhc .",

    "<S> i review a number of topics where conventional wisdom relevant to hadron physics at the lhc has been challenged . for example </S>",
    "<S> , the initial - state and final - state interactions of the quarks and gluons entering perturbative qcd hard - scattering subprocesses lead to the breakdown of traditional concepts of factorization and universality for transverse - momentum - dependent observables at leading twist . </S>",
    "<S> these soft - gluon rescattering effects produce bjorken - scaling single - spin asymmetries , the breakdown of the lam - tung leading - twist relation in drell - yan reactions , as well as diffractive deep inelastic scattering , the antishadowing of nuclear structure functions is predicted to depend on the flavor quantum numbers of each quark and antiquark , thus explaining the anomalous nuclear dependence observed in deep - inelastic neutrino scattering . </S>",
    "<S> isolated hadrons can be produced at large transverse momentum directly within a hard higher - twist qcd subprocess , rather than from jet fragmentation , even at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> such  </S>",
    "<S> direct \" processes can explain the observed deviations from pqcd predictions of the power - law fall - off of inclusive hadron cross sections at fixed @xmath0 , as well as the  baryon anomaly \" , the anomalously large proton - to - pion ratio seen in high - centrality heavy - ion collisions at rhic . </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic charm contribution to the proton structure function at high @xmath1 can explain the large rate for high @xmath2 photon plus charm - jet events observed by d0 at the tevatron . </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic charm and bottom distributions imply a large production rate for charm and bottom jets at high @xmath2 at the lhc , as well as a novel mechanism for higgs and @xmath3 production at high @xmath4 the light - front wavefunctions derived in ads / qcd can be used to calculate jet hadronization at the amplitude level . </S>",
    "<S> the elimination of the renormalization scale ambiguity for the qcd coupling using the scheme - independent blm method will improve the precision of qcd predictions and thus increase the sensitivity of searches for new physics at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> the implications of  in - hadron condensates \" for the qcd contribution to the cosmological constant are also discussed .    </S>",
