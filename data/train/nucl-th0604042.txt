    "the morse potential has raised a great deal of interest over the years and has been one of the most useful models to describe the interaction between two atoms in a diatomic molecule .",
    "it is known that the radial schrdinger equation for this potential can be solved exactly when the orbital angular quantum number @xmath0 is equal to zero @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it is also known that for @xmath1 , one has to use some approximations to find analytical or semi - analytical solutions .",
    "several schemes have been presented for obtaining approximate solutions @xcite . among these approximations ,",
    "the most widely used and convenient one is the pekeris approximation @xcite , which is based on the expansion of the centrifugal barrier in a series of exponentials depending on the internuclear distance up to the second order .",
    "other approximations have also been developed to find better analytical formulas for the rotating morse potential .",
    "however , all these approximations other than the pekeris one require the calculation of a state - dependent internuclear distance through the numerical solutions of transcendental equations @xcite",
    ". in this respect , the rotating morse potential has so far been solved by the super - symmetry ( susy ) @xcite , the nikiforov - uvarov method ( nu ) @xcite , the shifted and modified shifted 1/n expansion methods @xcite as well as the variational method @xcite using pekeris approximations for @xmath2 .",
    "it is also solved by using the hypervirial perturbation method ( hv ) @xcite with the full potential without pekeris approximation .    in this paper ,",
    "our aim is to solve the rotating morse potential using a different and more practical method called , the asymptotic iteration method ( aim ) @xcite within the pekeris approximation and to obtain the energy eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions . in the next section , the asymptotic iteration method ( aim )",
    "is introduced .",
    "then , in section [ apply ] , the schrdinger equation is solved by the asymptotic iteration method with the non - zero angular momentum quantum numbers for the rotating morse potential : the exact energy eigenvalues and corresponding wave functions are calculated for the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 diatomic molecules and aim results are compared with the findings of the susy @xcite , the hypervirial perturbation method ( hv ) @xcite , the nikiforov - uvarov method ( nu ) @xcite and the shifted and modified shifted 1/n expansion methods @xcite as well as with the variational method @xcite .",
    "finally , section [ conclude ] is devoted to the summary and conclusion .",
    "we briefly outline the asymptotic iteration method here and the details can be found in references @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic iteration method is proposed to solve the second - order differential equations of the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 and s@xmath9(x ) , @xmath10(x ) are in c@xmath11(a , b ) .",
    "the variables , s@xmath9(x ) and @xmath10(x ) , are sufficiently differentiable .",
    "the differential equation ( [ diff ] ) has a general solution @xcite @xmath12\\ ] ] if @xmath13 , for sufficiently large @xmath14 , we obtain the @xmath15 values from @xmath16 where @xmath17 the energy eigenvalues are obtained from the quantization condition .",
    "the quantization condition of the method together with equation ( [ iter ] ) can also be written as follows @xmath18    for a given potential such as the rotating morse one , the radial schrdinger equation is converted to the form of equation ( [ diff ] ) .",
    "then , s@xmath19 and @xmath20 are determined and s@xmath21 and @xmath22 parameters are calculated .",
    "the energy eigenvalues are determined by the quantization condition given by equation ( [ kuantization ] ) .",
    "however , the wave functions are determined by using the following wave function generator @xmath23",
    "the motion of a particle with the reduced mass @xmath24 is described by the following schrdinger equation :    @xmath25+v(r ) \\right)\\psi_{n\\ell m}(r,\\theta,\\phi)=e\\psi_{n\\ell m}(r,\\theta,\\phi)\\label{sch}\\ ] ]    the terms in the square brackets with the overall minus sign are the dimensionless angular momentum squared operator , @xmath26 . defining @xmath27 , we obtain the radial part of the schrdinger equation : @xmath28u_{n\\ell}(r)+\\frac{2 \\mu e}{\\hbar^{2}}u_{n\\ell}(r)=0 \\label{radialr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is sometimes convenient to define @xmath29 and the effective potential as follows : @xmath30 since @xmath31 the radial schrdinger equation given by equation ( [ radialr ] ) follows that @xmath32r_{n\\ell}(r)=0 \\label{factorschrodinger}\\ ] ] instead of solving the partial differential equation ( [ sch ] ) in three variables @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , we now solve a differential equation involving only the variable @xmath33 , but dependent on the angular momentum parameter @xmath0 , which makes the solution of this equation difficult for @xmath1 or sometimes impossible within a given potential .",
    "the morse potential we examine in this paper is defined as @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 . here ,",
    "@xmath39 and @xmath40 denote the dissociation energy and morse parameter , respectively .",
    "@xmath41 is the equilibrium distance ( bound length ) between nuclei and @xmath42 is a parameter to control the width of the potential well . for the @xmath3 diatomic molecule , the effective potential , which is the sum of the centrifugal and morse potentials ,",
    "is shown in figure [ pot ] for various values of the orbital angular momentum .",
    "the superposition of the attractive and repulsive potentials results in the formation of a potential pocket , whose the width and depth depend on the orbital angular momentum quantum number for a given molecular potential . the potential pocket becomes shallower as the orbital angular momentum quantum number @xmath0 increases , which also indicates that the number of states supported by the potential decreases .",
    "this pocket is also very important for the scattering case due to the interference of the barrier and internal waves , which creates the oscillatory structure in the cross - section .",
    "the effect of this pocket can be understood in terms of the interference between the internal and barrier waves that corresponds to a decomposition of the scattering amplitude into two components , the inner and external waves  @xcite .",
    "the effective potential together with the morse potential for @xmath1 can be written as , @xmath43 it is known that the schrdinger equation can not be solved exactly for this potential for @xmath1 by using the standard methods such as susy and nu . as it is seen from equation  ( [ veff ] ) ,",
    "the effective potential is a combination of the exponential and inverse square potentials , which can not be solved analytically .",
    "therefore , an approximation has to be made : the most widely used and convenient one is the pekeris approximation .",
    "this approximation is based on the expansion of the centrifugal barrier in a series of exponentials depending on the internuclear distance , keeping terms up to second order , so that the effective @xmath0-dependent potential keeps the same form as the potential with @xmath0=0 @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out , however , that this approximation is valid only for low vibrational energy states . in the pekeris approximation , by change of the coordinates @xmath37 , the centrifugal potential is expanded in a series around @xmath44 @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "taking up to the second order degrees in this series and writing them in terms of exponentials , we get    @xmath47    in order to determine the constants @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , we also expand this potential in a series of @xmath51 @xmath52 comparing equal powers of equations ( [ expand ] ) and ( [ exp ] ) , we obtain the constants @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 as , @xmath53 now , the effective potential with pekeris approximation becomes , @xmath54 instead of solving the radial schrdinger equation for the effective potential given by equation ( [ veff ] ) , we solve the radial schrdinger equation for the new effective potential given by equation ( [ veffpekeris ] ) obtained by using the pekeris approximation .",
    "inserting this effective potential equation ( [ veffpekeris ] ) into equation ( [ factorschrodinger ] ) and using the following _ ansatzs _ @xmath55 the radial schrdinger equation takes the following form : @xmath56 if we rewrite equation ( [ radyal ] ) by using a new variable of the form @xmath57 , we obtain @xmath58r_{n\\ell}(y)=0\\ ] ] in order to solve this equation with aim for @xmath59 , we should transform this equation to the form of equation ( [ diff ] ) .",
    "therefore , the reasonable physical wave function we propose is as follows @xmath60 if we insert this wave function into the equation ( [ trans ] ) , we have the second - order homogeneous linear differential equations in the following form @xmath61 which is now amenable to an aim solution . by comparing this equation with equation ( [ diff ] )",
    ", we can write the @xmath62 and @xmath63 values and by means of equation ( [ iter ] ) , we may calculate @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "this gives ( the subscripts are omitted ) : @xmath66 combining these results with the quantization condition given by equation ( [ kuantization ] ) yields @xmath67 when the above expressions are generalized , the eigenvalues turn out as @xmath68 using equation ( [ ansatz ] ) , we obtain the energy eigenvalues e@xmath69 , @xmath70^{2}+\\gamma c_{0}\\ ] ] as it is seen that the energy eigenvalue equation is easily obtained by using aim .",
    "this is the advantage of the aim that it gives the eigenvalues directly by transforming the radial schrdinger equation into a form of @xmath71 = @xmath72 . in order to test the accuracy of equation ( [ energyeigenvalues ] )",
    ", we calculate the energy eigenvalues of the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 diatomic molecules .",
    "the aim results are compared with those obtained by susy method @xcite using original pekeris approximation , the hypervirial perturbation method ( hv ) @xcite , the shifted 1/n and modified shifted 1/n expansion methods @xcite for the @xmath3 diatomic molecule in table [ table1 ] . in table [ table2 ] , we show the same comparison for the @xmath4 diatomic molecule . furthermore , the aim results are compared with those obtained by nu method @xcite , shifted 1/n and modified shifted 1/n expansion methods @xcite for the @xmath5 and @xmath6 diatomic molecules in tables [ table3 ] and [ table4 ] , respectively . as it can be seen from the results presented in these tables that the aim results are in good agreement with the findings of the other methods .    after we find the energy eigenvalues , the following wave function generator can be used to find @xmath73 functions by using aim @xmath74where @xmath75 represents the radial quantum number and @xmath14 shows the iteration number .",
    "below , the first few @xmath76 functions can be seen    @xmath77    it can be understood from the results given above that we can write the general formula for @xmath73 as follows , @xmath78 thus , we can write the total radial wave function as below , @xmath79 when the hypergeometric function is written in terms of the laguerre polynomials , we get @xmath80    where @xmath81 is the normalization constant and can be obtained from @xmath82^{2}dy=1 $ ] as below , @xmath83 where @xmath84 .",
    "we have shown an alternative method to obtain the energy eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions of the rotating morse potential using pekeris approximation within the framework of the asymptotic iteration method .",
    "the main results of this paper are the energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions , which are given by equations ( [ energyeigenvalues ] ) and ( [ wave1 ] ) respectively .",
    "the energy eigenvalues are obtained for the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 diatomic molecules .",
    "our aim results are compared with the findings of the other methods such as the susy @xcite , the hypervirial perturbation method ( hv ) @xcite , the nikiforov - uvarov method ( nu ) @xcite and the shifted and modified shifted 1/n expansion methods @xcite as well as the variational method @xcite in tables [ table1 ] , [ table2 ] , [ table3 ] and [ table4 ] .",
    "the advantage of the asymptotic iteration method is that it gives the eigenvalues directly by transforming the radial schrdinger equation into a form of @xmath71 = @xmath72 .",
    "the wave functions are easily constructed by iterating the values of @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the method presented in this study is a systematic one and it is very efficient and practical .",
    "it is worth extending this method to the solution of other interaction problems .",
