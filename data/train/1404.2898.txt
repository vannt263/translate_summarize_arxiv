    "besides bound companions or natural satellites , planets may have unbound companions or co - orbitals , i.e. objects trapped in a 1:1 mean motion resonance with the planet .",
    "co - orbital bodies are not only interesting curiosities found in the celestial mechanics studies , but also represent temporary reservoirs for certain objects as well as the key to understand the origin of retrograde outer satellites of the giant planets and the accretional processes in the early solar system ( see e.g. namouni , christou & murray 1999 )",
    ". these co - orbital bodies can be primordial , if they were captured in their present resonant state early in the history of the solar system and have remained dynamically stable for billions of years , or transient , if they were captured relatively recently .",
    "several thousand minor bodies are known to be currently trapped in the 1:1 mean motion resonance with jupiter and most of them may have remained as such for gyr ( see e.g. milani 1993 ; jewitt , trujillo & luu 2000 ; morbidelli et al .",
    "2005 ; yoshida & nakamura 2005 ; robutel & gabern 2006 ; robutel & bodossian 2009 ; grav et al .",
    "2011 ; nesvorn , vokrouhlick & morbidelli 2013 ) .",
    "neptune also hosts a likely large population of co - orbitals both long - term stable ( e.g. kortenkamp , malhotra & michtchenko 2004 ; nesvorn & vokrouhlick 2009 ; sheppard & trujillo 2006 , 2010 ) and transient ( e.g. de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos 2012b , c ) . in sharp contrast",
    ", the number of asteroids currently engaged in co - orbital motion with uranus appears to be rather small and its nature comparatively ephemeral .",
    "uranus has centaurs temporarily trapped in other mean motion resonances as well ( masaki & kinoshita 2003 ; gallardo 2006 , 2014 ) .",
    "the theoretical possibility of finding primordial or transient uranian co - orbitals , in particular trojans , has been a subject of study for almost three decades . in general",
    ", numerical simulations predict that uranus may have retained a certain amount of its primordial co - orbital minor planet population and also that short - term stable ( for some myr ) co - orbitals may exist .",
    "zhang & innanen ( 1988a , b ) and innanen & mikkola ( 1989 ) found that some tadpole orbits may survive for 10 myr .",
    "mikkola & innanen ( 1992 ) described tadpole orbits stable for at least 20 myr and with libration amplitudes close to 100 ; horseshoe orbiters were only stable for shorter periods of time ( @xmath610 myr ) .",
    "holman & wisdom ( 1993 ) found similar results .",
    "gomes ( 1998 ) explained the observational absence of primordial uranus trojans as a side effect of planetary migration .",
    "wiegert , innanen & mikkola ( 2000 ) focused on quasi - satellites and found that some test orbits were stable for up to 1 gyr but only at low inclinations ( @xmath62 ) and with eccentricities in the range 0.10.15 .",
    "nesvorn & dones ( 2002 ) concluded that any existing uranus primordial trojan population should have now been depleted by a factor of 100 .",
    "gacka ( 2003 ) also found short - term stable tadpole orbits . in a very detailed study , marzari , tricarico & scholl ( 2003 ) identified a real absence of trojan stable orbits at low libration amplitudes and also that , among the jovian planets , uranus has the lowest probability of hosting long - term stable trojans .",
    "horner & evans ( 2006 ) stated that uranus appears not to be able to efficiently capture objects into the 1:1 commensurability today even for short periods of time .",
    "lykawka & horner ( 2010 ) found that uranus should have been able to capture and retain a significant population of trojan objects from the primordial planetesimal disc by the end of planetary migration .",
    "these authors concluded that originally the orbits of these objects should have had a wide range of orbital eccentricities and inclinations .",
    "predictions from numerical simulations appear to be generally consistent with the available observational evidence that transient uranian co - orbitals do exist but primordial ones may not .",
    "so far , uranus has only three known co - orbitals : 83982 crantor ( 2002 go@xmath0 ) ( gallardo 2006 ; de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos 2013b ) , 2010 eu@xmath1 ( de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos 2013b ) and 2011  qf@xmath2 ( alexandersen et al .",
    "2013a ; alexandersen et al .",
    "due to its present short data - arc ( 85 d ) , 2010 eu@xmath1 is better described as a candidate .",
    "asteroids crantor and 2010 eu@xmath1 follow horseshoe orbits in a frame of reference rotating with uranus and 2011  qf@xmath2 is an l@xmath7 trojan ; the three of them are only short - term stable and , therefore , they must be captured objects .",
    "most published studies focus on what makes a hypothetical primordial population of uranian co - orbitals dynamically unstable , leaving the question of how the transient ones got captured unanswered .    in absence of observational bias , the lack of a sizeable present - day population of minor bodies trapped in the 1:1 commensurability with uranus is probably due to persistent perturbations by the other giant planets .",
    "uranus trojans are affected by high - order resonances with saturn ( gallardo 2006 ) . in the case of current horseshoe librators , saturn also appears to be the main source of the destabilizing force ( de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos 2013b ) .",
    "dvorak , bazs & zhou ( 2010 ) studied the stability of hypothetical primordial uranus trojans and concluded that the trojan regions are mostly unstable . for these authors ,",
    "the orbital inclination is the key parameter to characterize the stability of uranus trojans ; only the inclination intervals ( 0 , 7 ) , ( 9 , 13 ) , ( 31 , 36)and ( 38 , 50)appear to be stable ( regions a , b , c and d , respectively , in dvorak et al .",
    "the existence of these islands of stability enables the presence of trojan companions to uranus .",
    "asteroid 2011  qf@xmath2 appears to inhabit one of these stable areas in orbital parameter space as its current orbital inclination is nearly 11but it is not a primordial uranus trojan .    here , we revisit the subjects of capture and stability of current uranian co - orbitals , providing an independent assessment of the 1:1 commensurability of the newly found uranus trojan , 2011  qf@xmath2 , studying its future orbital evolution and looking into its dynamical past . our numerical investigation is aimed at adding more pieces to the overall puzzle of the apparent scarcity of uranian co - orbitals as we explore the role of multibody ephemeral mean motion resonances . on the other hand ,",
    "the comparative study of both the dynamics of the few known co - orbitals and candidates , and their discovery circumstances , reveals important additional clues to solve this puzzle .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly discuss the numerical model used in our @xmath3-body simulations .",
    "the current status of 2011  qf@xmath2 is reviewed in section 3 . the capture mechanism and stability of 2011  qf@xmath2",
    "are further studied in section 4 .",
    "we revisit the cases of crantor and 2010 eu@xmath1 in section 5 .",
    "section 6 introduces a few new uranus co - orbital candidates . in section 7",
    ", we discuss our results on the stability of current uranian co - orbitals .",
    "we present a practical guide to discover additional objects in section 8 .",
    "section 9 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "in order to perform a comparative analysis of the orbital evolution of known transient uranian co - orbitals , we solve directly the newtonian equations of motion by means of the hermite integration scheme described by makino ( 1991 ) and implemented by aarseth ( 2003 ) .",
    "the adequacy of this integration approach for solar system dynamical studies has been extensively tested by the authors ( de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos 2012a , b , c , 2013a , b ) .",
    "the standard version of this @xmath3-body sequential code is publicly available from the ioa web sitesverre / web / pages / nbody.htm ] .",
    "our calculations include the perturbations by the eight major planets , the moon , the barycentre of the pluto - charon system and the three largest asteroids , ( 1 ) ceres , ( 2 ) pallas and ( 4 ) vesta .",
    "for accurate initial positions and velocities , we used the latest heliocentric ecliptic keplerian elements provided by the jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) online solar system data service ( giorgini et al .",
    "1996 ) and initial positions and velocities based on the de405 planetary orbital ephemerides ( standish 1998 ) referred to the barycentre of the solar system .",
    "the orbits were computed 1 myr forward and backward in time .",
    "additional details can be found in de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos ( 2012a ) .",
    "in addition to the orbital calculations completed using the nominal elements in tables [ elements0 ] and [ elements1 ] , we have performed 50 control simulations with sets of orbital elements obtained from the nominal ones and the quoted uncertainties . these control orbits follow a gaussian distribution in the six - dimensional space of orbital elements and their orbital parameters are compatible with the observations within the 3@xmath8 uncertainties ( see tables [ elements0 ] and [ elements1 ] ) , reflecting the observational incertitude in astrometry . in the integrations , the relative error in the total energy was always as low as @xmath9 or lower after a simulated time of 1 myr .",
    "the corresponding error in the total angular momentum is several orders of magnitude smaller . in all the figures , and unless explicitly stated , @xmath10 = 0 coincides with the jd2456800.5 epoch .",
    "asteroid 2011  qf@xmath2 was discovered on 2011 august 29 at @xmath11 = 22.6 mag by m. alexandersen observing from mauna kea with the canada  france ",
    "hawaii telescope ( cfht ; alexandersen et al .",
    "the observations were made as part of an ongoing survey with cfht , looking for trans - neptunian objects ( tnos ) and minor bodies located between the giant planets .",
    "however , they were not submitted to the minor planet center ( mpc ) until march 2013 ( the discovery was announced on 2013 march 18 ; alexandersen et al .",
    "the object was identified due to its relatively high proper motion with respect to the background stars .",
    "it is comparatively large with @xmath12 = 9.7 mag or a diameter close to 60 km assuming a 5 per cent albedo .",
    "its orbit is now reasonably well determined with 29 observations spanning a data - arc of 419 d and it is characterized by @xmath13 = 19.13 au , @xmath14 = 0.18 and @xmath15 = 1081 ( see table [ elements0 ] ) . using these orbital parameters , 2011  qf@xmath2 has been classified as a centaur by both the mpc database and the jpl small - body database .",
    "however , its period of revolution around the sun , 83.69 yr at present , is very close to that of uranus , 84.03 yr .",
    "that makes 2011  qf@xmath2 a very good candidate to inhabit uranus co - orbital region .",
    "0.3truecm    .heliocentric keplerian orbital elements of 2011  qf@xmath2 used in this research .",
    "values include the 1@xmath8 uncertainty .",
    "the orbit is based on 29 observations spanning a data - arc of 419 d ( epoch = jd2456800.5 , 2014-may-23.0 ; j2000.0 ecliptic and equinox .",
    "source : jpl small - body database ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     [ discovery ]     ( panel b ) ; as a function of @xmath14 ( panel c ) ; as a function of @xmath16 ( panel d ) ; as a function of @xmath17 ( panel e ) . ]     and 12@xmath18 and declination @xmath19(-20 , 20 ) . ]",
    "in this paper , we have presented a detailed analysis of the orbital evolution and stability of present - day uranus co - orbitals , focusing on how they got captured in the first place and what makes them dynamically unstable .",
    "our calculations show that these objects are submitted to multiple mean motion resonances and exhibit significant secular dynamics characterized by a complex structure that sometimes includes apsidal corotations .",
    "the dynamical behaviour analysed here is a typical example of highly nonlinear dynamics , resonances inside a resonance or even resonances inside a resonance inside a resonance .",
    "this is best studied using numerical simulations not analytical or semi - analytical work .",
    "some of our results verify predictions made by marzari et al .",
    "( 2003 ) after studying the diffusion rate of uranian trojans .",
    "we confirm that 2011  qf@xmath2 currently moves inside uranus co - orbital region on a tadpole orbit .",
    "the motion of this object is primarily driven by the influence of the sun and uranus , although both jupiter and neptune play a significant role in destabilizing its orbit . the resonant influence of jupiter and neptune was determinant in its capture as uranus co - orbital .",
    "the precession of the nodes of 2011  qf@xmath2 , which appears to be controlled by the combined action of saturn and jupiter , marks its evolution and short - term stability .",
    "a three - body mean motion resonance is responsible for both its injection into uranus co - orbital region and its ejection from that region",
    ". the object will remain as uranus trojan for ( very likely ) less than 1 myr . even if 2011  qf@xmath2 is one of the most stable of the known bodies currently trapped in the 1:1 commensurability with uranus , it is unlikely to be a primordial 1:1 librator .",
    "our comparative study of currently known uranus co - orbitals and candidates shows that the candidate 2010  eu@xmath1 is more stable than 2011  qf@xmath2 because of its lower eccentricity ( 0.05 versus 0.18 ) even if 2010  eu@xmath1 has higher orbital inclination ( 148 versus 1080 ) . on the other hand , a new candidate , 2002  vg@xmath4 ,",
    "is found to exhibit dynamical behaviour very similar to the one discussed for 83982 crantor ( 2002  go@xmath0 ) in de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos ( 2013b ) and here .",
    "this new candidate is the first identified quasi - satellite of uranus ; crantor will also become a quasi - satellite in the near future .",
    "the presence of two objects characterized by similar dynamics and found by chance suggests that others , yet to be discovered , may share their properties .",
    "asteroid 1999  hd@xmath5 may signal the edge of uranus co - orbital region . in any case , all these objects have present - day dynamical ages much shorter than that of the solar system ; therefore , they are not members of a hypothetical population of primordial objects trapped in a 1:1 mean motion resonance with uranus since the formation of the solar system",
    ". they may be former primordial neptune co - orbitals ( horner & lykawka 2010 ) though .",
    "horner & evans ( 2006 ) argued that present - day uranus can not efficiently trap objects in the 1:1 commensurability even for short periods of time .",
    "however , the available evidence confirms that , contrary to this view and in spite of the destabilizing role of the other giant planets , uranus still can actively capture temporary co - orbitals , even for millions of years . regarding the issue of stability ,",
    "both crantor s and 2011  qf@xmath2 s orbital inclinations are within one of the stability islands identified by dvorak et al .",
    "( 2010 ) for the case of trojans .",
    "both candidates 2002  vg@xmath4 and 2010 eu@xmath1 move outside the stability islands proposed in that study although they are not trojans .",
    "the existence of 1999  hd@xmath5 shows that not only inclination but also eccentricity play an important role in the long - term stability of uranus co - orbitals .",
    "a larger sample of uranus co - orbitals is necessary to understand better the complex subject of the stability of these objects although temporary uranian co - orbitals are often submitted to complicated multibody ephemeral mean motion resonances that trigger the switching between the various resonant co - orbital states , making them dynamically unstable .",
    "currently available evidence suggests that the small number of known transient uranus co - orbitals may have its origin in observational bias rather than in the strength of the gravitational perturbations by the other giant planets . taking this into account",
    ", the number of yet undiscovered transient uranian co - orbitals may likely be as high as that of the neptunian ones .",
    "our results can easily be applied to implement improved strategies for discovering additional uranian co - orbitals .",
