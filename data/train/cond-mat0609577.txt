    "the josephson effect provides a fundamental signature of phase coherent transport through mesoscopic samples with time reversal symmetry @xcite . here",
    ", we reconsider the theory of the josephson effect through a quantum dot ( qd ) in a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) , taking into account rashba and/or dresselhaus spin orbit ( so ) couplings @xcite . despite the large recent interest concerning so effects in qds , mainly caused by quantum information @xcite and spintronics applications @xcite , the question of how the josephson current is modified by",
    "so couplings has barely been addressed .",
    "naively , since so couplings do not break time reversal symmetry , one may expect that they will not affect the josephson effect at all .",
    "this expectation seems basically confirmed by the existing theoretical studies : in ref .",
    "@xcite , the josephson current through a _ perfectly contacted _",
    "2deg with rashba coupling is predicted to only show so - related modifications in the simultaneous presence of a zeeman field . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the same conclusion has been reached for a _ single - channel _   conductor with arbitrary contact resistance .",
    "moreover , in ref .",
    "@xcite , by a generalization of earlier scattering approaches @xcite , the case of a wide 2deg with arbitrary contact resistance was studied , where the semiclassically averaged josephson current is again found to be insensitive to rashba so couplings .",
    "however , the presence of a josephson current through the mesoscopic system necessarily breaks time reversal invariance and therefore we reexamine this expectation in the present paper .    as 2deg devices based on inas - related materials",
    "are known to exhibit strong gate - tunable @xcite rashba so couplings , and possibly dresselhaus so couplings , we study this problem here from the perspective of multi - level qd physics .",
    "supercurrents through related devices have been probed by several experiments ; for recent work , see refs .",
    "it is thus not only of academic interest to quantitatively examine the effects of rashba / dresselhaus so couplings on the equilibrium josephson current .",
    "moreover , very recently , gate - tunable supercurrents through thin inas nanowires have been reported @xcite , revealing complex current - phase relations such as @xmath1-junction behavior .",
    "although we study a 2deg geometry , our results are also relevant for such nanowires : the transport channels reside in a surface charge layer , and rashba terms due to narrow - gap and strong confinement fields dominate over all other so couplings . in those experiments , josephson currents through few - level dots have already been achieved .    in the present work ,",
    "we arrive at the surprising conclusion that _ so couplings have huge effects on the josephson current in nanoscale multi - level dots_. depending on the parameter regime , the critical current can be largely suppressed or enhanced . in a single - level dot , so effects on the josephson current vanish unless there is also a zeeman field , but in multi - level dots no such restriction applies . the predicted strong dependence on so couplings should be observable in state - of - the - art experiments .",
    "we also show that _ oscillations in the critical current _",

    "although the connection between the superconducting leads and the dot appears in the form of a tunneling hamiltonian , we treat these terms below to all orders by integration over the lead degrees of freedom .",
    "this provides justification for ignoring coulomb interactions on the qd . over the last decade ,",
    "several works @xcite have shown that in the limit of high transparency , i.e. for tunneling rates large compared to the dot charging energy , charge quantization ( coulomb blockade ) effects are strongly suppressed due to large charge fluctuations .",

    "given the fact that the hamiltonian is quadratic in the fermion operators , the calculation should proceed in a straightforward manner . in the absence of spin flips ,",
    "such quadratic hamiltonians are typically dealt with by introducing nambu spinors . for the present case ( see appendix ) , the presence of spin flip processes makes it necessary to introduce two types of nambu spinors to describe the dot . in the end , the effective action describing the quantum dot coupled to the leads can nevertheless be written in terms of grassmann fields @xmath57 and @xmath58 for the dot fermions ( @xmath59 is imaginary time ) . for a multilevel dot , we thus form the nambu spinor for dot level @xmath30 , @xmath60 with fermionic matsubara frequencies @xmath61 ( integer @xmath62 ) .",

    "[ fig3 ] . here",

    "this simple reasoning also explains why the position of the @xmath2 maximum depends only very weakly on the @xmath145 .",
    "the resonance condition , however , depends trigonometrically on the so coupling @xmath0 via @xmath146 , see eq .",
    "( [ ael ] ) .",
    "it results from the interplay between so couplings and the multilevel nature of the qd . by the description in terms of andreev bound states ,",
    "we can also understand why for large dots ( long or wide ) , the effect of the so coupling is negligible .",
    "first , for a ` long ' dot , taking @xmath131 , @xmath146 decreases as @xmath147 , and therefore the so effects on the josephson current vanish as @xmath148 .",
    "second , when the lateral dimension of the dot is large , the confinement frequency @xmath82 becomes small .",
    "now @xmath146 contains @xmath82 as a prefactor , and hence is once again suppressed . in both situations , the effect of the so interaction",
    "is merely reduced to a shift of energy levels .",
    "a qualitative argument in favor of such a resonance process can be reached as follows .",
    "schematically , when a cooper pair enters the dot from the left , either its electrons occupy the same transverse level or they can choose different ` paths ' ( different transverse levels ) , in a manner quite similar to a cross - andreev scattering process @xcite .",
    "the so interaction acts differently in these two levels because the longitudinal momenta of both states are not identical .",
    "two electrons entering the qd from , say , the left electrode have initially antiparallel spins , but their respective spins now precess at different rates because of this mismatch in longitudinal momentum . depending on the value of @xmath77 ,",
    "the two electrons which then exit the qd at the right side may , however , be brought back to an antiparallel configuration , leading to a resonance in the critical current caused by the presence of so couplings .",
    "on the other hand , if the spins do not reach the antiparallel configuration , the josephson current will be reduced .    note that more than one resonance can be achieved by a careful choice of parameters .",
    "this effect is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . for a multi - level dot with small confinement frequency",
    ", the multiple resonances associated with all possible pairs of paths ( pairs of levels ) will start to overlap significantly .",
    "it is then natural to expect that in the limit of very wide quantum dots , these averaging effects will wash out any so - related structures in the josephson current , consistent with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite for infinite width .",
    "to conclude , we have studied the josephson current through a multi - level quantum dot in the presence of rashba and dresselhaus spin orbit couplings . in the absence of electron - electron interactions on the dot ,",
    "this problem is exactly solvable , a simple consequence of the fact that the hamiltonian is quadratic in the creation / annihilation operators .",
    "( our model consists of a noninteracting quantum dot including spin flip processes and connected to bcs superconducting leads . )",
    "nevertheless , the combination of superconducting leads and spin - flip terms renders a calculation of the josephson current a quite technical task , which we chose to address via functional integral techniques .",
    "we have explicitly shown results for one and two levels , but our general expressions can be applied to arbitrary situations .    for a single dot level , spin - orbit effects cancel out unless a magnetic zeeman field is included . in this case , we predict spin precession ( datta - das ) effects in the josephson current , i.e. oscillations as a function of the effective length of the dot .",
    "these oscillations have amplitude of the order of a few tenths of the nominal critical current , which should be observable .",
    "they result from the interplay between the period of the oscillating effective magnetic field ( caused by the combined effects of the zeeman and rashba interactions ) with the wavelength of the longitudinal modes in the dot .    more interestingly , for the case of a double dot ,",
    "spin precession effects show up even in the absence of an external magnetic field .",
    "this is a novel effect in the field of josephson physics for devices subject to spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the supercurrent can be drastically modified , either containing sharp peaks or being largely suppressed .",
    "the experimental observation of such peaks could constitute evidence for spin - orbit effects in a superconducting transistor .",
    "possible extensions of this work could include coulomb interaction effects in the dot , which will be important when the tunneling rates become comparable to the dot charging energy .",
    "while the inclusion of such effects is beyond the scope of this paper , the present formulation of the problem with functional integral techniques can be adapted to include them in an approximate manner .",
