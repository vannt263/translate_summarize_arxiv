    "shear alfvn modes are a well - established feature of toroidal magnetically confined plasmas .",
    "these weakly damped modes are of substantial interest to fusion research as they may become unstable through resonant interaction with fast particles .",
    "this can degrade fast particle confinement , reducing plasma heating and damaging plasma facing components .",
    "inhomogenous toroidal plasmas give rise to a continuum of modes of varying frequency , resonant on particular flux surfaces .",
    "asymmetries in the magnetic geometry of the plasma lead to couplings between different poloidal and toroidal harmonics , resulting in gaps in the continuous spectrum in which global modes can occur .",
    "examples of this type of gap mode include the toroidicity and elipticity induced shear alfvn eigenmodes ( the tae  and eae  respectively ) @xcite .",
    "global modes can also occur due to extrema of the continuous spectrum , which can arise from variation of the magnetic geometry and density of the plasma @xcite .",
    "resonant power absorption occurs where the eigenfrequency coincides with the frequency of a continuum branch .",
    "physically , dissipative effects such as charge separation and mode conversion occur at these resonances , resulting in continuum damping .",
    "these effects and the resulting damping can be described using a kinetic theory of plasmas . the standard approach to calculate this damping numerically is to represent these processes using a resistive magnetohdrodynamic ( mhd ) model . in these models ,",
    "continuum damping represents the limit of resistive damping as resistivity vanishes .",
    "however , this damping can also be found in non - dissipative ideal mhd  theory . in this case the singularity resulting from the continuum resonance must be treated in accordance with the causality condition , which implies integration around the singularity to give a negative imaginary frequency component .",
    "this is formally analagous to the treatment of landau damping in collisionless plasmas @xcite .",
    "as they have complex frequencies , the solutions to the eigenvalue problem where continuum resonance interaction occurs are more accurately described as `` quasi - modes '' @xcite .",
    "however , the more common description of the solutions as `` modes '' is used in this work .",
    "a number of techniques have been developed for calculating continuum damping using ideal mhd .",
    "analytic treatments have been developed based on solution of the wave equation using asymptotic matching @xcite , representing the resonance as a perturbation following a ballooning transformation @xcite and representing the resonance as a perturbation to the lagrangian for a global mode @xcite .",
    "these techniques have been limited to the analysis of taes  in large aspect - ratio circular cross - section tokamaks .",
    "continuum damping has previously been calculated numerically by including a set of analytically determined jump conditions due to singularities at continuum resonances @xcite .",
    "continuum damping has also been computed for shear alfvn eigenmodes in tokamak and stellarator cases using a numerical method in which the eigenvalue problem was solved along a complex contour @xcite . however , in these cases , calculations were resticted to only two coupled harmonics in the large aspect ratio limit .",
    "nevertheless , this complex contour technique proved more computationally efficient than the standard approach of finding damping in the limit of vanishing resistivity .    in this paper",
    "we describe the results of a complex contour method for calculating continuum damping of shear alfvn eigenmodes in general three - dimensional toroidal geometry .",
    "thus , modes involving couplings between many different poloidal and toroidal harmonics may be computed .",
    "this allows , for the first time , the capability to compute continuum damping in stellarators with realistic geometry .",

    "the numerical solution is expressed as @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are poloidal and toroidal mode numbers and @xmath36 is the number of toroidal field periods .",
    "the eigenvalue problem is reformulated in terms of @xmath37 , which is a linear combination of b - splines .",
    "this reduces the poloidal and toroidal resolution required for the spline basis .",
    "continuum resonance damping can be calculated by solving the tae  wave equation along a complex contour in the radial coordinate @xcite .",
    "this is analogous to the analysis of landau damping of plasma oscillations @xcite . in that case",
    "dissipationless damping arising from inhomogeneity in velocity space is analysed by choosing an appropriate contour in velocity space .",
    "poles due to continuum resonances are circumvented , and therefore singularities in the solution are avoided .",
    "damping is represented by an imaginary component of eigenfrequency . in order to implement this technique the equilibrium quantities in equation ( [ eq : wave_equation ] )",
    "must be analytically continued to determine their values at complex values of the radial coordinate along the integration contour .",
    "the damping of taes  computed using the complex contour technique in ideal mhd  has previously been shown to converge to the same value as in the limit as resistivity is reduced to zero in resistive mhd  @xcite .",
    "the causality condition specifies that poles due to continuum resonances should lie between the integration contour and the real axis .",
    "physically , this condition ultimately arises from the requirement that any perturbation to the state of the plasma preceedes its effect on other plasma parameters .",
    "this in turn implies that modes decay rather than grow with time and hence that @xmath38 .",
    "the imaginary frequency component causes the poles to move from real to complex values of the radial coordinate .    if the integration contour is shifted away from poles due to continuum resonances , the calculated modes will vary less rapidly in their vicinity .",
    "thus , the solution to the eigenvalue problem can be accurately represented by basis functions defined on a coarser radial grid .",
    "consequently , the eigenvalue will have faster convergence with respect to radial grid resolution for greater deformations of the integration contour . however , excessive deformations may result in the disappearence of alfvn eigenmodes as the continuum gaps they exist in close . in such cases",
    "the chosen complex contour intersects with analytically continued branches of the continuous spectrum .",
    "additionally , non - physically meaningful poles may result due to the analytic continuation of equilibrium quantities .",
    "these poles should not lie between the integration contour and real axis , in order to avoid spurious contributions to the eigenfrequency .",
    "the continuum damping calculations described below are performed using a complex contour described by : @xmath39 here , @xmath40 $ ] is a real parameter .",
    "the real valued function @xmath41 is either chosen to be a quadratic : @xmath42 or the product of a quadratic and a gaussian function @xmath43 the parameters @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively determine the scale , width and location of the deformation into the complex plane . defining a profile using the latter function allows a more localised contour deformation than the former .",
    "thus , larger deformations in the vicinity of the pole can occur while avoiding non - physically meaningful poles .",
    "therefore , it is possible to calculate continuum damping with a smaller grid resolution .",
    "however , as the deformation becomes narrower and its scale increases , the rate of variation of the solution in that region is expected to increase .",
    "thus , increased radial resolution may be required where @xmath44 is too large and @xmath45 is too small .      in order to solve the eigenvalue problem in equation ( [ eq : wave_equation ] )",
    "it is necessary to calculate values of equilibrium quantities for complex values of @xmath22 .",
    "these include density @xmath47 , toroidal flux @xmath48 , poloidal flux , @xmath49 , current @xmath50 , magnetic field , @xmath51 , pressure @xmath52 , jacobian @xmath53 and metric tensor elements @xmath54 .",
    "one possible approach to estimating these quantities for complex @xmath22 is by using a truncated taylor series expansion . where the radial coordinate @xmath22 has real component @xmath55 and imaginary component @xmath56 , expanding the function @xmath57 about @xmath55 yields @xmath58 this approximation may be used with spline representations of equilibrium quantities . however , these piecewise polynomial functions are not analytic , which can lead to branch cuts when extended to the complex plane .",
    "if the complex contour deviates sufficiently from the real axis , the calculated values of the functions might contain significant contour dependent errors .",
    "integration across branch cuts may thus affect the result of the finite element calculation , leading to poor eigenvalue convergence with respect to the chosen complex contour .",
    "this is found to be the case for both the axisymmetric tokamak and stellarator examples , when the first three terms in the expansion for each quantity were retained . in these cases",
    "poor convergence is observed with respect to the choice of contour ( as parameterised @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 for contours described by equation ( [ eq : awk_path ] ) ) .",
