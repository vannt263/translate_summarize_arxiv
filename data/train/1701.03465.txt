    "ultra - faint dwarf galaxies ( ufds ) are the faintest known galaxies @xcite . some of them are even fainter than typical globular clusters , albeit they are much more extended than the latter .",
    "dwarf galaxies fainter than @xmath4 mag and larger than @xmath5 ( effective radius ) = 20 pc are often called as ufds @xcite .",
    "they are optically feeble , but they are dominated by dark matter , having very high values of mass to light ratios @xcite .",
    "thus nearby ufds may be ideal laboratories to explore the particle properties of dark matter ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "stellar populations in ufds are mostly old metal - poor stars .",
    "@xcite found , from deep photometry of six ufds around the milky way galaxy , that formation of the stars in these galaxies was finished by 11.6 gyr ago ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "they suggested that this early quenching of star formation might have been due to global processes such as the reionization of the universe .",
    "thus , ufds are considered to be fossils of the first galaxies @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite suggested , from high resolution simulations of the first galaxies , that some ufds may be the remnants of a few distinct star clusters that were dissolved and expanded to the size of ufds .",
    "ufds may be the most abundant type of galaxies in the universe , but they are revealing today only a tiny tip of a giant iceberg to our current observational facilities @xcite .",
    "they were first discovered , as a small overdensity of resolved red giant stars , around the milky way galaxy from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data , and more of them were found later around m31 in the local group @xcite . with recent advent of the dark energy camera on ctio 4 m telescope",
    ", as many as 17 new ufds have been discovered around the milky way galaxy and the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) in 2015 @xcite .",
    "it is expected that more ufds will be discovered in the local group soon from current and future wide field surveys ( e.g. , lsst , panstarrs , etc ) .",
    "ufds in the local group can play an important role to help resolving the well - known missing satellite dwarf problem @xcite and understanding the nature of the first galaxies .",
    "however , it is very difficult to find ufds outside the local group with the current observational facilities .",
    "therefore little is known about the ufds outside the local group .",
    "surprisingly , @xcite discovered one ufd , virgo ufd1 , in the intracluster field of the virgo cluster , using deep images of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) available in the mast archive .",
    "virgo ufd1 was found as a resolved stellar overdensity .",
    "virgo ufd1 is the first ufd found beyond the local group .",
    "total magnitude and effective radius of virgo ufd1 are @xmath7 mag and @xmath8 pc , and its central surface brightness is as low as @xmath9 mag arcsec@xmath10 .",
    "metallicity of the stars in this galaxy is estimated from their colors , to be , on average , very low , [ fe / h ] @xmath11 .",
    "virgo ufd1 is located at the distance of @xmath12 mpc , being the most distant ufd at the time of discovery .",
    "later @xcite reported detection of one ufd in the remote halo of ngc 5128 ( cen a ) , a massive elliptical galaxy at the distance of 3.8 mpc .",
    "they used the images obtained as part of the panoramic imaging survey of centaurus and sculptor ( pisces ) at the magellan 6.5 m telescope .    in this letter",
    "we report a serendipitous discovery of an ufd , fornax ufd1 , breaking the distance record of virgo ufd1 . it is located in the outskirts of ngc 1316 , a giant galaxy in the fornax cluster .",
    "fornax ufd1 was detected as a small group of resolved stars in the hst / acs images for a halo field of ngc 1316 , obtained as part of the carnegie - chicago hubble program ( cchp ) @xcite .",
    "the cchp is an ongoing program to estimate the value of the hubble constant ( @xmath13 ) with high precision using the population ii distance indicators , using rr lyrae and the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) @xcite . as part of the cchp , deep f606w and f814w images of a halo field in the outskirt of ngc 1316 using hst / acs",
    "were obtained .",
    "total exposure times for f606w and f814w are 14,676s and 24,396s , respectively .",
    "these data were used for estimation of the distance to ngc 1316 using the trgb @xcite , and detailed analysis of the data is given in @xcite .",
    "we use photometry of the point sources derived from these images by @xcite .",
    "the magnitudes of the point sources in the images were derived using daophot @xcite . in this study",
    "we adopted a distance to ngc 1316 based on the trgb , given in @xcite : @xmath14 and @xmath15 mpc .",
    "foreground extinction and reddening values toward ngc 1316 are small , @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "* figure [ fig_finder](a ) * displays the location of the hst field in the @xmath18 and @xmath19 color image of the inner region of ngc 1316 provided by the eso archive , embedded in the gray - scale map of the deep @xmath20-band image given by @xcite .",
    "a smaller spiral galaxy in the north of ngc 1316 is ngc 1317 ( sab(r)a ) .",
    "this image shows various substructures including shells and ripples around ngc 1316 , which are probably merger remnants @xcite .",
    "the hst field is located at @xmath21 south - east of the ngc 1316 center , where diffuse stellar light of ngc 1316 is barely visible .",
    "it is expected that this hst field would be dominated by old halo stars in ngc 1316",
    ". a color image of the hst field is also displayed in * figure [ fig_finder](b)*.",
    "first , we searched for any dwarf galaxies with low surface brightness in the hst images of ngc 1316 , which would appear to be similar to the morphology of virgo ufd1 ( see fig . 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "since the fornax cluster is only slightly more distant than the virgo cluster , it is expected that some of the brightest stars in fornax ufds , if any , would be resolved in the deep hst images .    through visual inspection of the images",
    ", we noticed the presence of a small group of faint resolved point sources embedded in diffuse stellar light in the southern part of the hst field ( at the position of the small red circle in * figure [ fig_finder](b ) * ) .",
    "a zoom - in image of the field centered on the new system in * figure [ fig_finder](c ) * shows clearly a faint fuzzy system embedding a small number of resolved stars , the diameter of which is about @xmath22 .",
    "this new system looks much fainter and smaller than any other typical dwarf galaxies in the fornax cluster @xcite .",
    "this system turns out to be , indeed , a new ufd , named as fornax ufd1 , as shown below .",
    "fornax ufd1 is located @xmath23 ( @xmath2455 kpc ) south - east of the ngc 1316 center in the sky .",
    "* figure [ fig_cmd](a ) * displays the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of the resolved point sources in a circular region with @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the projected radial distance from the center of fornax ufd1 .",
    "we plotted also the cmd of the control field in the annular region at @xmath27 , in * figure [ fig_cmd](b)*. the area of this control field is 50 times bigger than that of the fornax ufd1 field .",
    "the cmd of the point sources in the control field shows a broad red giant branch ( rgb ) , and these point sources are mostly rgb stars in the halo of ngc 1316 @xcite .",
    "we used statistical subtraction to remove the contribution of the foreground and background sources from the cmd in ( a ) , using the cmd of the control field .",
    "for this process we used bins with 0.3 mag in both magnitude and color , which is similar to the mean errors of the rgb stars .",
    "* figure [ fig_cmd](c ) and ( d ) * show two realizations of the control field subtraction .",
    "both cmds look very similar in general . in the lower panels of *",
    "figure [ fig_cmd ] * , we plotted similar cmds but for virgo ufd1 @xcite for comparison .",
    "there are 12 resolved stars brighter than @xmath28 mag in the net cmds ( * figure [ fig_cmd](c ) and ( d ) * ) .",
    "the number of field contaminants with @xmath29 mag in the area covered by the ufd field is estimated to be @xmath30 , while there are 15 stars in the area of ufd .",
    "thus the net number of the member stars in the area of the ufd is estimated to be @xmath31 , which is consistent with the number derived after cmd decontamination .",
    "eight of the 12 stars have a narrow range of colors with @xmath32 , showing a vertical sequence , while three of them show much redder colors than the others .",
    "therefore , these eight stars are considered to show the rgb of fornax ufd1 , while three redder stars are probably foreground or background sources .    because of the small sample of the rgb stars in the cmd , it is not easy to derive an accurate distance to fornax ufd1 .",
    "we estimate approximately the distance to this ufd , assuming that the mean magnitude of the two brightest blue rgb stars in the cmd , corresponds to the magnitude of the trgb .",
    "the mean magnitude and color of these two stars are @xmath33 mag and @xmath34 .",
    "this magnitude value is 0.24 mag fainter than the value of virgo ufd1 , @xmath35 mag @xcite ( see the lower panels in figure [ fig_cmd ] ) . applying the trgb calibration in @xcite to this trgb magnitude",
    ", we derive a value for the distance to fornax ufd1 , @xmath36 mpc ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "this value is consistent with the distance to ngc 1316 .",
    "this shows that fornax ufd1 is likely to belong to fornax .    in * figure [ fig_cmd ]",
    "* we overlayed 12 gyr isochrones for [ @xmath38/fe]=0.2 @xcite and [ fe / h ] @xmath39 to 0.4 in the dartmouth model @xcite , which were shifted according to the distance and foreground reddening for fornax ufd1 .",
    "although the number of stars is small , the rgb of ufd1 is , on average , bluer and narrower compared with the rgb of ngc 1316 in the control field .",
    "this shows that the mean metallicity of this new ufd is much lower than that of the ngc 1316 halo .",
    "the cmd of these rgb stars is matched roughly by the rgb part of the isochrones for low metallicity .",
    "it is noted that the rgb of fornax ufd1 is even bluer than the rgb of the lowest metallicity with [ fe / h ] @xmath1 .",
    "we estimate roughly the mean metallicity of the rgb stars to be [ fe / h ] @xmath40 .",
    "we constructed radial profiles of surface brightness and cumulative integrated magnitude of fornax ufd1 using iraf / ellipse , as plotted in * figure [ fig_surf](a ) and ( b)*. we masked out cosmic rays and background galaxies in the original image , and ran the ellipse task adopting a smoothing option of @xmath41 pixel binning .",
    "the radial profiles of surface brightness in * figure [ fig_surf ] * show a flat core in the inner region at @xmath42 and decline rapidly in the outer region , showing that this ufd is a dynamically relaxed system like typical old star clusters .",
    "the radial profiles of surface brightness for @xmath43 are fitted well by a sersic law @xcite with an index @xmath44 for @xmath45-band and @xmath46 for @xmath47-band .",
    "the effective radius measured at the @xmath45-band of this galaxy is @xmath48 ( @xmath49 pc ) .",
    "this value is much larger than that of the typical globular clusters , @xmath50 pc .",
    "its central surface brightness for @xmath45 and @xmath47-bands corrected for foreground extinction are derived to be @xmath51 mag arcsec@xmath10 and @xmath52 mag arcsec@xmath10 , respectively .",
    "we derived the radial number density profile of the rgb stars with @xmath29 mag and @xmath53 , choosing an annular region at @xmath54 to subtract the field contribution .",
    "this profile at @xmath55 is similar to the surface brightness profiles , as shown in * figure [ fig_surf]*.        the integrated color of fornax ufd1 for the aperture of @xmath5 is estimated to be @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the integrated color of fornax ufd1 is consistent with those of early - type dwarf galaxies in fornax @xcite , and that of virgo ufd1 @xcite .",
    "the radial profiles of @xmath45 and @xmath47-band integrated magnitude of this galaxy become approximately constant at @xmath58 .",
    "the integrated magnitude for @xmath58 is estimated to be @xmath59 mag and @xmath60 mag .",
    "these values can be considered to be the total magnitudes of fornax ufd1 .",
    "corresponding absolute magnitudes of this galaxy are derived to be @xmath61 mag and @xmath62 mag .",
    "these results show that this new system is indeed a genuine ufd .",
    "we list basic parameters of fornax ufd1 in * table 1*.",
    "@xcite published the fornax cluster catalog ( fcc ) based on the wide field photographic survey of fornax galaxies . following this , several studies used ccd images to find new fainter galaxies in fornax and investigate their properties @xcite .",
    "@xcite imaged a long strip region from ngc 1399 to ngc 1291 ( an area of 13.8 deg@xmath63 ) in fornax , finding a large number of low surface brightness dwarf galaxies with @xmath64 mag .",
    "these are unresolved faint galaxies .",
    "later deeper surveys of the central region in fornax found a number of fainter dwarf galaxies .",
    "the detection limits of the dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) in the survey of @xcite and @xcite are @xmath65 mag ( @xmath66 mag ) , and @xmath67 mag arcsec@xmath10 .",
    "@xcite determined distances to early - type dwarf galaxies in fornax using the surface brightness fluctuation ( sbf ) method , and confirmed that 30 of the des with @xmath68 mag are the members of fornax .",
    "fornax ufd1 is about one magnitude fainter that the detection limits of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite covered the central region of fornax with dark energy camera on ctio 4 m as part of the program for the next generation fornax survey ( ngfs ) , discovering 158 new dwarf galaxies with @xmath69 mag .",
    "the effective radii and effective surface brightness of these galaxies are @xmath70 to 2.8 kpc and @xmath71 to 28.0 mag arcsec@xmath10 .",
    "thus the parameters of fornax ufd1 are similar to the faint limit in their sample . however ,",
    "none of the stars in fornax ufd1-like dwarf galaxies can be resolved at the pixel scale of the dark energy camera images .",
