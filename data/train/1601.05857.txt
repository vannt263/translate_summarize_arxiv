    "continuum observations at radio wavelengths have been a key component of observational astrophysics for many decades .",
    "the fact that radio observations are not affected by dust obscuration means that they lack many selection biases that exist in observations at other wavebands , and a typical source at the bright end of the radio luminosity function will be associated with a radio - loud active galactic nucleus ( agn ) with a median cosmological redshift of @xmath11 ( condon , 1984 ) . moving towards fainter flux limits ,",
    "radio observations become sensitive to the radio quiet agn population , and an increasing fraction of galaxies whose radio synchrotron emission is driven by star formation ( condon , 1992 ) .",
    "radio continuum observations thus provide unique insight into black hole activity ( e.g.  jarvis & rawlings , 2000 ; smoli et al .",
    ", 2009b ; rigby et al . , 2011 ;",
    "mcalpine , jarvis & bonfield , 2013 ; banfield et al . , 2014 ; best et al . , 2014 ) and star formation ( e.g.  seymour et al . , 2008 , smoli et al .",
    ", 2009a ; jarvis et al . , 2015a ) across the history of the universe .",
    "sky surveys typically have a trade - off between depth and area .",
    "radio surveys with the broadest coverage at @xmath1gigahertz frequencies tend to be ` flagship ' projects , occupying a significant fraction of available telescope time and covering most of the entire visible sky by means of a very large number of short snapshot pointings to @xmath1mjy beam@xmath4 depths .",
    "examples include the nrao vla ( very large array ) sky survey ( nvss ; condon et al . , 1998 ) , faint images of the radio sky at twenty - cm ( first ; becker , white & helfand , 1995 ) , and the sydney university molonglo sky survey ( sumss ; bock , large & sadler , 1998 ; mauch et al . , 2003 ) .",
    "the very deepest observations tend to cover only a single primary beam of the instrument , for example the lockman hole observation of condon et al .",
    "( 2012 ) which reaches a depth of approximately 1 @xmath3jy beam@xmath4 .",
    "there are many examples that sit somewhere between these two extremes that typically cover a few square degrees over numerous extragalactic deep fields , where radio observations form one part of a panchromatic picture .",
    "such surveys have been carried out with several radio telescopes , including the ( karl g.  jansky ) vla ( e.g. bondi et al . ,  2003 ; simpson et al . , 2006 ;",
    "schinnerer et al . , 2007 ; miller et al .",
    ", 2013 ; heywood et al . , 2013 ) , the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ; e.g. de vries et al . , 2002 ) the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ; e.g. garn et al . , 2007 ) and the australia telescope compact array ( atca ; e.g. norris et al . , 2006 ; middelberg et al . ,",
    "2008 ) .    the square kilometre array ( ska ; dewdney et al . ,",
    "2013 ) promises to revolutionise our understanding of star formation ( jarvis et al . , 2015a ) and agn processes ( smoli et al . , 2015 )",
    "across cosmic time , as well as truly realise the potential that deep _ and _ wide radio continuum surveys have for answering key questions in cosmology ( jarvis et al . , 2015b ) .",
    "as we move towards construction of the ska , a new generation of large scale radio continuum surveys are being planned and executed with new ska pathfinder instruments , as well as through significant hardware upgrades of some existing radio telescopes .",
    "the increased capabilities of these machines over their predecessors ,  typically some combination of an expanded field of view , more sensitive receivers and a huge increase in instantaneous bandwidth  will allow surveys with depth or areal coverage that improve on existing observations by orders of magnitude .    at the deep end the mightee survey on the meerkat telescope ( booth & jonas , 2012 ) aims to cover 35 square degrees to a depth of 1  @xmath3jy beam@xmath4 in its deepest tier ( jarvis , 2012 ) .",
    "complementary to such deep observations are the all - sky surveys : the askap ( johnston et al . , 2008 ; de boer et al . , 2009 ) emu survey ( norris et al . , 2011 ) aims to cover the entire sky south of declination + 30@xmath5 to a depth of 10@xmath3jy with 10@xmath6 angular resolution .",
    "the wodan survey ( rttgering et al . , 2011 ) will use apertif ( oosterloo et al .",
    ", 2009 ; van cappellen & bakker , 2010 ) , a hardware upgrade to the wsrt , to complete the full sky coverage by conducting a similar survey in the northern hemisphere . the successor to nvss is also being planned for the vla , and at the time of writing is envisaged to consist of an all - sky snapshot survey at 24  ghz , reaching a depth of 69  @xmath3jy beam@xmath4 , and taking advantage of the extended configurations of the vla to reach an angular resolution of 2.5@xmath6 ( condon , 2015 ) .",
    "these will be complemented by large - area surveys at low radio frequencies using aperture arrays , including the now largely complete 30160  mhz msss survey using the low frequency array ( heald et al . , 2014 ) and the gleam survey with the murchison widefield array ( wayth et al . , 2015 ) at 80230  mhz .",
    "the askap and apertif telescopes both feature phased array feed ( paf ) receivers , in which an array of many receptors is placed in the focal plane of each of the dishes .",
    "the voltages from these multi - element receptors are linearly combined with multiple sets of complex weights and summed to generate multiple beams , steered in different directions within the field of view of the instrument .",
    "paf beams from each dish are cross - correlated with those sharing the same direction from all other dishes .",
    "this parallel processing of multiple beams results in a dramatic increase in field of view ( and therefore survey speed ) over an equivalent single pixel feed instrument .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of a pilot , three epoch , broadband ( 7111015 mhz ) continuum imaging survey covering approximately 150 square degrees in the constellation of tucana , and encompassing about two - thirds of the _ spitzer _ south pole telescope deep field ( ashby et al . , 2013 ) , using the boolardy engineering test array ( beta ) .",
    "this is a prototype of the askap array , consisting of 6 of the 36 dishes , equipped with the first generation ( mark i ) paf system ( schinckel et al . , 2011 )",
    "based on a connected - element ` chequerboard ' array ( hay & osullivan , 2008 ) .",
    "a detailed description of beta is provided by hotan et al .",
    "( 2014 ) .",
    "we describe the observations in section [ sec : obs ] and the calibration and imaging procedure in section [ sec : reduction ] .",
    "the data products are described in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "the photometric , astrometric and spectroscopic performance of beta is examined in detail in sections [ sec : photometry ] , [ sec : astrometry ] and [ sec : spectra ] . for these purposes we primarily make use of sumss ,",
    "carried on using the molonglo observatory synthesis telescope ( most ) which is well matched to the beta observations in terms of frequency and angular resolution . we also make use of lower frequency observations with the gmrt and higher frequency observations from the vla , chiefly nvss and first .",
    "concluding remarks are made in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "3 square arrangement , and those associated with each pointing centre are represented by a common colour on this plot . ]    the target field was observed with beta on three separate occasions as part of the commissioning and verification of the instrument .",
    "the telescope delivers 304 mhz of instantaneous bandwidth and for these observations the sky frequency range was 7111015 mhz , corresponding to a fractional bandwidth of 35% .",
    "the data are captured with a frequency resolution of 18.5  khz , using 16,416 frequency channels across the band .",
    "the digital beamformers of beta ( bunton et al . , 2011 ; hampson et al . , 2011 ) are capable of delivering nine dual - polarisation beams that can be placed arbitrarily within the @xmath130 square degree field of view of the instrument . at present a maximum signal - to - noise algorithm",
    "is employed to form the compound beams ( applebaum , 1976 ; hotan et al . , 2014 ) .",
    "in brief , this approach requires the paf elements to be excited to high significance by a strong signal .",
    "the sun is appropriate for such a purpose on a 12  m dish .",
    "the direction of a given beam is enforced by steering the antenna so that the sun lies along that direction , and determining complex weights for each of the 188 paf elements ( 94 in each orthogonal mode of linear polarisation ) to maximise signal from the sun with respect to the system noise . in the case of these observations a regular 3  @xmath0  3 footprint of beams was employed , with a central on - axis beam surrounded by eight additional beams on a square grid with a spacing of 1.46 degrees between the centre of each beam .",
    "the spacing of the grid was chosen to be approximately the half - power beam width of a single paf beam at the band centre . for ` traditional ' mosaicking of a region of sky using a single pixel feed interferometer , the array will typically observe a list of discrete positions that have the primary beam from one pointing situated at the half power point of the adjacent scan , typically with a hexagonal arrangement . in the case of askap ,",
    "the three - axis mount on the antennas in the array keeps the deployed beam pattern fixed on the sky relative to the antenna pointing direction ( unless the weights are adjusted ) .",
    "thus an appropriate combination of beam pattern and pointing positions can be devised to rapidly cover a large area of sky to approximately uniform depth .",
    "for this project the beta array spent five minutes on each of twelve sky positions , repeating the cycle for the 12 hour duration of the observation .",
    "the pointing positions are arranged in six close pairs , with the close pairs used to offset the fact that the beam spacing at any given pointing is twice the value that would generally be used for a standard mosaic ( bunton & hay , 2011 ; hay & bird , 2015 ) .",
    "the end result is the approximately uniform sky coverage shown in figure [ fig : ptgs ] , effectively mimicking a traditional 108 pointing radio survey using only twelve beta pointings .",
    "groups of nine beams share the same colour in this plot .",
    "cycling around the twelve pointing centres with short five minute integrations over a twelve hour observation builds up favourable fourier plane coverage for each of the pointings , which is shared by the nine beams associated with that pointing .",
    "the ( @xmath7,@xmath8 ) plane coverage of a single pointing is shown in figure [ fig : uvplot ] .",
    "the radial coverage afforded by the 304  mhz of bandwidth is apparent , and the points are coloured per baseline .",
    "note that the shortest baseline has been removed for reasons explained in section [ sec : preprocessing ] .",
    "the askap antennas are equipped with an additional axis of movement ( the roll axis ; forsyth et al . , 2009 )",
    "that keeps the parallactic angle fixed over the course of an observation , and thus keeps the beam pattern fixed on the sky without the need for continual adjustment of the weights ( hay , 2011 ) . for each of the pointing positions for this survey",
    "the roll axis position was adjusted to remove the parallactic angle offset from scans that occur along lines of fixed declination .",
    "the end result is a more regular survey area that does not taper with declination .",
    "the survey area was observed with beta on three separate occasions .",
    "table [ tab : epochs ] lists the start and end times of the askap scheduling blocks ( sbs ) used in the project .",
    "in addition to the observations of the target field a calibration scan is performed whereby the array executes a pointing pattern that places the standard calibrator source pks b1934@xmath9638 at the nominal centre of each beam for 5 minutes . these scans ( marked with the asterisks in table [ tab : epochs ] )",
    "are used to calibrate the bandpass response of each beam and to set the flux density scale .",
    "note that sbs 1206 and 1207 were merged into a single data set . with a total duration of 8h 38 m",
    "this observation is shorter than those of sbs 1229 and 1231 .",
    "further details of the calibration process are provided in section [ sec : reduction ] .",
    "the beamforming process was initiated at 05:00 ut on 2 december 2014 , immediately prior to the first astronomical observation performed as part of this pilot survey , as listed in table [ tab : epochs ] . no further updates to the beamformer weights were made during these observations .    ,",

    "each baseline has a unique colour on this plot . ]",
    ".start and end times and dates ( ut ) for the askap scheduling blocks ( sbs ) that were used in this project .",
    "sbs marked with an asterisk ( * ) indicate that the observations consist of per - beam scans of the standard calibrator source pks b1934@xmath9638 , as described in the text .",
    "note that sbs 1206 and 1207 are part of the same observing run which interrupted for approximately an hour .",
    "in total this first epoch has 8h 38 m of data making it shallower than the subsequent two epochs . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : sourcecounts ]",
    "the results presented in this paper demonstrate the viability and clear potential for using paf receivers to rapidly and accurately conduct broadband continuum imaging of the radio sky .",
    "beta consists of 6 of the 36 askap antennas , equipped with prototype mark i paf receivers , and we have presented the results of a pilot continuum imaging survey conducted with this instrument at 7111015 mhz .",
    "the sky coverage of the survey is approximately 150 square degrees in the constellation of tucana , achieved by forming nine simultaneous paf beams on the sky and mechanically repointing the telescope on a five - minute duty cycle through an appropriately spaced grid of twelve sky positions .",
    "approximately two - thirds of the _ spitzer _ south pole telescope deep field is covered .",
    "the survey area was observed in three 12-hour runs over the course of a week with the goal of verifying both the on - sky performance and the stability of the pafs .",
    "bandpass and flux density corrections were derived from a per - beam scan of pks b1934@xmath9638 associated with each of the three epochs , and ( self-)calibration and imaging was achieved with a fully automated pipeline based on standard packages .",
    "the principal data products from the survey are wide field radio images of the survey area in 4  @xmath0  76  mhz sub - bands for each of the three epochs , as well as a single image formed using the full bandwidth .",
    "additionally the three epochs have been combined into a single deep data set , for which sub - band and full - band mosaics were also generated .",
    "source component lists were derived from each of these 20 images using the pybdsm source finder .",
    "the survey mode performance and stability of the beta telescope and its compound beams were verified by comparing the three - epoch data with external measurements , principally from the sumss survey which is well matched to the beta data in both angular resolution , depth and observing frequency .",
    "the positions and flux densities of almost three thousand radio sources were measured with beta and verified to be as accurate as those from existing radio survey measurements .",
    "the major feature of our results that supersedes those from sumss comes from the use of the 35% fractional bandwidth of the observations to determine in - band spectral index measurements .",
    "a spectral index map of the survey area was produced for emission above 5  mjy beam@xmath4 , and the signal to noise ratio of 1,037 of the 3,722 components in the final catalogue was sufficient for spectral index measurements to be assigned to them .",
    "the spectral index distribution was found to be in good agreement with those derived from dual - frequency measurements made by interpolating gmrt and most data at 325 , 610 and 843 mhz with vla data at 1400 mhz .",
    "we also used the final catalogue to measure the differential source counts at 863 mhz .",
    "a search for variability and transient events between the three epochs , as well as thorough comparison to the sumss survey , reveals one significantly variable source : a candidate quasar for which the @xmath1850  mhz flux density has approximately doubled on a 17.5 year time scale .",

    "( 16,11.9 ) ( 1.68,-0.2 )    askap is a survey telescope and its primary mode of operation will involve filling the @xmath130 square degree field of view with an overlapping arrangement of beams . the base image product generated by the telescope will cover the full field of view , images created from individual beams are not envisaged to be a routinely produced data product .",
    "the accuracy of the multi - beam image is however critically dependent on the behaviour of the beams that are used to form it .",
    "significant problems with individual beams result in obvious defects in the mosaic , and the accuracy and repeatability of the multi - beam images that we have demonstrated in this paper demonstrate consistency in the individual electronic beams that were used to produce them .",
    "however for completeness , in this section we present an examination of the properties of the nine simultaneous beams that were deployed on the beta hardware .    a crude measurement of the total intensity ( stokes i ) beam shape can be made by taking the images formed from each beam prior to the primary beam correction , and measuring the apparent to intrinsic brightness ratios of the sources as a function of distance from the nominal beam centre .",
    "the apparent flux density measurements were made in one of the four beta sub - bands centred on 825.6  mhz .",
    "this was selected as it is closest to the sumss frequency of 843  mhz , which we use to provide the estimate of the intrinsic source flux density .",
    "no spectral correction is applied when measuring the ratio .",
    "component matches are subject to all the criteria described section [ sec : photometry ] .",
    "the apparent to intrinsic component flux density ratios as a function of distance from the nominal beam centre are plotted as the points on figure [ fig : singlebeams ] , for all nine beams in the 3  @xmath0  3 beam footprint , laid out in their relative arrangement on the sky .",
    "the main lobe is evident , as is the first sidelobe .",
    "the points are colour coded according to their epoch , as indicated in the key .",
    "no flux density cut has been made in order to maximise the number of measurements on the plot .",
    "however note that a hypothetical source detected at 5@xmath2 in both surveys could have an uncertainty in this ratio of up to @xmath130% , and such signal to noise considerations in both surveys result in the significant scatter in the plot .",
    "the line that traces the distribution of the points is the assumed primary beam model used to correct the images in this sub - band .",
    "it terminates at the 30% level , which is where the images were cut when forming the mosaic ( section [ sec : imaging ] ) .",
    "the vertical line shows the _ maximum _ separation between a pair of beams in the full mosaic , crossing the beam model at the half power point .",
    "no fit has been made between the assumed model and the points on this image , however the assumed beam model traces well the distribution of points , particularly in the region where errors would be most significant , i.e.  to the left of the vertical line .",
    "the model deviates from the points most as the beam gain lowers , however this is not uncommon , both in instruments with electronically formed beams ( e.g.  loi et al . ,",
    "2015 ) , and those with traditional single pixel feeds .",
    "figure [ fig : singlebeams ] demonstrates that there are no major beam to beam differences in the regions of interest , and the formation of mosaics with a single frequency - dependent airy pattern model of the main lobe provides astronomical imaging performance that is as accurate as any existing comparable observations , at least in total intensity , as shown in sections [ sec : photometry ] and [ sec : astrometry ] .",
    "an examination of the frequency dependence of the beam patterns would be informative , particularly given that the median spectral index measured by the beta observations appears to be slightly redder than those derived from other two - band , two - observation studies .",
    "as remarked in section [ sec : spectra ] , if the primary beam scales with frequency in a non - linear way then this could bias the spectral measurements .",
    "the technique used to probe the beam shape presented here can not be reliably extended to the frequency domain as one would have to assume a typical source spectral index in order to scale the sumss frequency , thus introducing a degeneracy with the very effect we would be attempting to constrain .",
    "the flux density of an @xmath11  =  @xmath90.8 source varies by approximately 30% between 711 and 1015  mhz .",
    "we defer attempts to investigate this further to a forthcoming paper ( mcconnell et al .",
    ", in prep . ) which will include the results of an observing campaign to holographically measure beta s formed beams",
    ".    theoretical models of paf beams suggest that the main lobes of the off - axis beams will exhibit small coma - like aberrations in their outer regions . the approach used to generate figure [ fig : singlebeams ] essentially azimuthally",
    "averages the beam profile .",
    "a two dimensional analogue of this plot does not have the necessary density of points to reliably reveal any azimuthal asymmetries , however there is apparent increased scatter in the measurements in the corner beams ( e.g. beams 3 and 5 ) when compared to the central beam ( beam 0 ) that could be a result of this effect .    finally , although there is significant overlap between the points measured from the three epochs , it does appear that the central epoch ( sb1229 ) exhibits a beam that is slightly narrower than the other epochs . as mentioned in section [ sec",
    ": photometry ] , the shape of an electronically formed beam can potentially be modulated by drifts in the electronic gains of the composite elements . any distinct colour banding seen in a plot such as figure [ fig : singlebeams ] may be a manifestation of this .",
    "( 16,10.7 ) ( 2.22,-0.2 )    a check of the positional accuracy of the sources in our images is made in section [ sec : astrometry ] ; however , this was done in terms of the full bandwidth imaging . here",
    "we present a measurement of the positional performance across the band in order to rule out the possibility of significant frequency dependent position shifts introducing gradients into the spectral index map ( the spectral index values in the catalogue would not be affected ) .",
    "we measure this effect by taking the source catalogue associated with the highest frequency sub - band and cross matching the components with those found in the lower three sub - bands .",
    "this comparison is made for all three epochs , repeating the method used to make figure [ fig : astrometry ] , and the results are presented in figure [ fig : band_astrometry ] .",
    "the points are once again colour coded by where the ( highest frequency ) flux density of the components lie in a set of logarithmically - spaced flux density bins as per the plot legend .",
    "no significant trend is seen as a function of frequency or epoch ; the scatter introduced by signal to noise considerations is the dominant effect .",
    "sub band images should have factor of two worse noise than full band images but scatter is comparable to the beta vs sumss scatter , likely due to the contribution to the measured positional offsets that arises due to the sumss survey having comparable angular resolution and depth to our observations , as discussed in section [ sec : astrometry ] .",
    "the mean measured offsets ( provided on the relevant panels of figure [ fig : band_astrometry ] ) point to a self - consistent astrometric reference frame across the band .",
    "there is an increasing mean declination offset with decreasing frequency , e.g.  rising from 0.11@xmath6 to 0.88@xmath6 in sb1206 - 1207 . repeating the measurements using randomly drawn subsets consisting of 800 sources ( roughly half the size of the per - sub - band catalogues ) produces a distribution of mean offsets that is scattered around zero , however we can not rule out some residual phase error across the band that remains due to calibration deficiencies . in any case",
    ", the magnitude of these offsets in comparison to the angular resolution of the survey is negligible ."
