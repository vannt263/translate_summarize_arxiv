    "accreting black holes exhibit a variety of spectral states @xcite , most often showing strong thermal emission from an optically thick accretion disk @xcite when they are at their brightest . as luminosities drop below a few percent of the eddington value ( @xmath2 ) , the level of thermal emission decreases , and the spectrum hardens , signaling a transition to the hard state @xcite .",
    "this state is also characterized by having a high level of x - ray variability and steady , self - absorbed compact jets , which are often observed in the radio band @xcite .",
    "in theory , it is predicted that the cool gas from the accretion disk will evaporate as the mass accretion rate drops @xcite .",
    "the implied increase in the inner radius of the optically thick disk , @xmath0 , is critical to the idea that a quasi - spherical advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) forms around the black hole @xcite .",
    "this model requires that @xmath0 increases to @xmath91001000 @xmath10 @xcite , where the gravitational radius is @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are constants , and @xmath14 is the black hole mass .",
    "recently , observational efforts to test the truncated disk picture have used two techniques : modeling the thermal emission from the disk and measuring the iron k@xmath15 emission line in the reflection component @xcite .",
    "the former technique is challenging because of uncertainties arising from electron scattering , irradiation of the disk , and the torque boundary condition at the disk s inner edge as well as the difficulty of modeling a soft x - ray component that is strongly affected by interstellar absorption . modeling the disk s thermal emission to estimate the inner radius ( @xmath0 )",
    "has led to mixed results with some in favor of an increase in @xmath0 @xcite and others in disagreement @xcite .",
    "the iron line provides a measurement of @xmath0 because it is doppler - broadened due to relativistic motion of the accretion disk material and gravitationally redshifted due to the black hole s gravitational field .",
    "broad iron lines have been seen from both stellar mass and supermassive black holes @xcite .",
    "one challenge to the relativistic interpretation in the case of stellar mass black holes is that the iron line shape may be affected by scattering in a wind @xcite .",
    "however , arguments in favor of the relativistic interpretation are presented in @xcite .    for stellar mass black holes at high luminosities ,",
    "the iron line profiles have been used extensively , and values of @xmath0 less than the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit for a non - rotating black hole , @xmath16  @xmath10 , have been measured for several systems @xcite , including gx  3394 .",
    "the broad iron line has , somewhat surprisingly , persisted into the hard state @xcite .",
    "however , for gx  3394 , the previous detections of the iron line in the hard state were obtained at luminosities above 1% @xmath2 , and it remains to be seen if there is evolution in the iron line profile at lower luminosities .",
    "gx  3394 is one of the most active black hole transients known , with 4 major outbursts in the past 7  yr . the distance to gx  3394 is @xmath98  kpc @xcite , and the orbital period is 1.7  days @xcite",
    ". the lower limit on the black hole mass is @xmath36  @xcite , and here , we adopt a value of 10 , corresponding to @xmath17 ergs  s@xmath18 .",
    "gx  3394 has allowed for some of the most in - depth studies of compact jets @xcite . here",
    ", we use _ suzaku _ and _ rxte _ observations of gx  3394 to study the iron line profile at 0.14% @xmath2 .",
    "we observed gx  3394 in the x - ray band over a period of 2.2  days during 2008 september 2427 with the _ suzaku _ @xcite and _ rxte _ @xcite satellites .",
    "the observation was made 1.6  yr after the peak of its 2007 outburst during a time when the source was active but faint @xcite .",
    "we analyzed the data using the heasoft v6.7 software , and the most recent instrument calibrations as of 2009 september 25 for _ suzaku _ and 2009 august 19 for _ rxte_. _ suzaku _ observed gx  3394 continuously over the 2.2  day period ( except for earth occulations ) , and we accumulated 105,000  s of on - source time for the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ) and 106,800  s for the pin layer of the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ) .",
    "the _ suzaku _",
    "data are all contained in observation i d 403067010 .",
    "_ rxte _ made five shorter ( 2,300 to 3,500  s ) observations during the same time period .",
    "the observation ids are 93702 - 04 - 01 - 01 , 93702 - 04 - 01 - 02 , 93702 - 04 - 01 - 03 , 93702 - 04 - 02 - 00 , and 93702 - 04 - 02 - 01 , and we obtained a total proportional counter array ( pca ) exposure time of 14,640  s and a total high - energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ) exposure time of 4,625  s. we also observed gx  3394 in the radio band at the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) on 2008 august 18 and september 28 .    for observations of relatively faint sources close to the galactic plane ,",
    "an additional step is required for the pca spectrum to subtract any other emission in its field - of - view @xcite . to do this , we obtained data from _ rxte _ observations of gx  3394 when the source was in quiescence @xcite .",
    "these observations occurred between 2001 march and 2002 february and also on 2003 september 29 .",
    "the average quiescent count rate is @xmath96% of that measured during the 2008 september observations .",
    "we subtracted the quiescent pca spectrum for the spectral fits below .",
    "we first used the x - ray and radio properties to identify the spectral state .",
    "we produced the energy spectrum shown in figure  [ fig : spectrum]a , and fitted it with an absorbed power - law model . to model the absorption , we used elemental abundances that approximate interstellar values @xcite and atomic cross sections from @xcite . for the xis spectra",
    ", we did not include the data in the 1.71.9  kev range due to uncertainties in the instrument calibration near the silicon k - edge .",
    "the overall normalizations between instruments were left as free parameters in the model , and the fluxes given below are based on those measured by xis0+xis3 .",
    "the measured model parameters are the interstellar column density , @xmath19 @xmath20 , the power - law photon index , @xmath21 , and the unabsorbed 0.412  kev flux of @xmath22 ergs  @xmath20  s@xmath18 ( 90% confidence uncertainties , @xmath23 ) .",
    "although this model provides a good description of the continuum , the quality of the fit is not good ( @xmath24 ) due to the presence of a strong iron k@xmath15 line near 6.4  kev .    to characterize the x - ray timing properties , we produced xis light curves in the 0.42.5  kev and 2.512  kev energy bands with 8  s time resolution and pca light curves in the 325  kev band with 16  s resolution .",
    "an inspection of the light curves shows that while they show strong variability and flaring , they are very similar in the different energy bands , indicating that the spectrum changes very little with flux .",
    "we also produced a pca power spectrum at frequencies from 0.005 to 64  hz . the power spectrum is well - described by a power - law with an index of @xmath25 , and a fractional rms value of 55% @xmath26 2% ( 0.0110  hz ) .",
    "the atca radio observations show flux densities of @xmath27 and @xmath28  mjy at frequencies ( @xmath29 ) of 4.80 and 8.64  ghz , respectively , on august 18 . for the same frequencies , the september 28 flux densities are @xmath30 and @xmath31  mjy .",
    "these measurements indicate spectral indices of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where the flux density is given by @xmath34 .",
    "self - absorption of the compact jets that are seen in the hard state causes flat or slightly inverted radio spectra ( @xmath35 ) , and our measurements are consistent with this .    thus , the hard energy spectrum , the high level of timing noise , and the evidence for the presence of a compact jet are all consistent with the source being in the hard state during our observation .    .",
    "the largest residuals are seen near 67 kev and are due to the iron k@xmath15 emission line.[fig : spectrum],scaledwidth=45.0% ]      the residuals shown in figure  [ fig : spectrum]b indicate the deviation of the data from a power - law , and the presence of an iron k@xmath15 emission line is clear .",
    "when we add a gaussian to model the emission line , we measure a line energy of @xmath36  kev , consistent with neutral to moderately ionized iron , a line width of @xmath37  kev , and an equivalent width ( ew ) of @xmath38  ev . with the addition of the iron line , the quality of the fit improves dramatically to @xmath39 .",
    "the total 1100  kev unabsorbed flux is @xmath40 ergs  @xmath20  s@xmath18 , which is a factor @xmath99 lower than the lowest level at which an iron line was previously detected for gx  3394 @xcite , and this flux corresponds to a luminosity of 0.14% @xmath2 .    before discussing the implications of the presence of this narrow iron line , it is critical to determine if the iron line could be related either to poor background subtraction or to emission from other sources in the galactic plane . for the xis detectors",
    ", we examined the background spectrum from two @xmath41 rectangular regions on the detectors and verified that only internal background lines of the detector appear ( see * ? ? ? * for information about the xis internal background ) without any evidence for other background lines with strong emission in the iron k@xmath15 region .",
    "emission from the galactic ridge includes iron k@xmath15 emission with the most prominent line being due to he - like iron at 6.7  kev @xcite .",
    "although the emission is very strong in the galactic center region , it decreases for lines - of - sight away from the galactic center and drops especially rapidly with galactic latitude ( @xmath42 ) . in the scutum region , at a galactic longitude of @xmath43 , a scale height of @xmath44 is estimated @xcite .",
    "thus , at the position of gx  3394 ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 @xmath47 ) , the galactic ridge emission is expected to be weak , but possibly not negligible .",
    "the fact that the xis0+xis3 background spectrum does not show an emission line at 6.7  kev suggests that we are not detecting galactic ridge emission in our observation of gx  3394 . as an additional check",
    ", we produced a new gx  3394 spectrum using a circular extraction region centered on the source with a radius of @xmath48 , which is five times smaller than the @xmath49 radius region used previously .",
    "this causes a reduction in the source count rate by a factor of 2.1 while reducing the background by a factor of 25 .",
    "thus , the strength of any background features will decrease by an order of magnitude .",
    "fitting the new gx  3394 xis spectrum with an absorbed power - law model and inspecting the residuals still clearly shows an iron line at 6.4  kev .",
    "adding a gaussian to fit the iron line , we measure an ew of @xmath50  ev , which is consistent with no change from the ew of @xmath51  ev that we measure with xis with the larger extraction region . based on this and",
    "the background spectrum discussed above , we conclude that the iron line is from gx  3394 .    to use the shape of the iron line to constrain @xmath0 , we return to fitting the full spectrum shown in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] , and we replaced the gaussian component with the laor model @xcite , which accounts for the relativistic effects near a rotating black hole .",
    "the line energy and ew are @xmath52  kev and @xmath53  ev , respectively .",
    "the other model parameters are @xmath0 , the inclination of the inner disk , @xmath4 , and the emissivity index , @xmath54 , which is a power - law index that sets how the line - emissivity ( @xmath55 ) of the disk changes with radius according to @xmath56 .",
    "although a broad line allows for good constraints on all 3 parameters , this is not the case for a narrow line .",
    "thus , we restricted the range of @xmath54 to be between 2 , which corresponds to a value where the contribution to the iron line from large radii begins to diverge @xcite , and 3 , which is consistent with the value obtained from previous measurements of the gx  3394 iron line in the hard state @xcite .",
    "the inclination has been previously measured to be @xmath57 degrees @xcite . for @xmath0 ,",
    "the spectral fits indicate 68% and 90% confidence lower limits of @xmath384  @xmath10 and @xmath365  @xmath10 , respectively , if @xmath58 . as a value of @xmath59  @xmath10",
    "was obtained when the source was bright @xcite , our results indicate that the inner radius changes by a factor of @xmath327 . figure  [ fig : profile ] illustrates the huge difference between the profile that we measure and a profile with @xmath59  @xmath10 .",
    "emission line from gx  3394 measured by xis0+xis3 ( in grey ) .",
    "the profile is shown in terms of a data - to - model ratio , where the model is an absorbed power - law fitted to the _ suzaku _ and _ rxte _ spectra , excluding the 4.08.0  kev region .",
    "we determined the model profiles ( in black ) by restoring the 4.08.0  kev data and fitting the entire spectrum with a model consisting of an absorbed power - law plus a relativistic laor iron line .",
    "for the profiles shown , we used a disk inclination of @xmath60 and an emissivity index of @xmath61 .",
    "the solid black line shows a profile with @xmath62  @xmath10 , which corresponds to the best fit value .",
    "the other two profiles ( dashed and dotted black lines ) were obtained by fixing @xmath0 to 30  @xmath10 and 2.4  @xmath10 , respectively , and then refitting the spectrum , allowing the line energy and normalization to adjust .",
    "[ fig : profile],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    fixing the disk inclination to @xmath58 is appropriate for constraining the ratio of inner radii at 0.14% and 1215% @xmath2 since we do not expect the disk inclination to change significantly with luminosity , being set either by the binary inclination or the spin axis of the black hole .",
    "however , for obtaining a physical value of @xmath0 , we need to consider the inclination .",
    "we refitted the full spectrum with the power - law plus laor model , allowing @xmath4 to be a free parameter and @xmath54 to be free in the range 23 .",
    "then , we performed a grid search of inclinations covering @xmath63 to @xmath64 and values of @xmath0 covering 10 to 210 @xmath10 . figure  [ fig : contour ] shows the results in terms of the 68% and 90% confidence contours .",
    "the contours show that at lower inclinations , the constraint on @xmath0 becomes somewhat weaker , but even at @xmath6 , the results indicate a truncated disk with @xmath5 ( 90% confidence ) . on the other hand , at disk inclinations above @xmath60 , the inferred values of @xmath0 rise rapidly .",
    "for example , at @xmath8 , the limit is @xmath7 .    )",
    "error region and the light grey region shows the 90% confidence ( @xmath65 ) error region.[fig : contour],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    there are at least two reasons why our limits on @xmath0 are conservative in the sense that the disk may be even more truncated .",
    "first , @xcite show that , especially for the disks around stellar mass black holes , thermal motions of the disk material can lead to significant broadening of the iron line .",
    "if this is the case for gx  3394 , then less doppler broadening from bulk motion in the accretion disk would be required .",
    "second , it has been pointed out that if the disk inclination is really as low as @xmath60 and the disk inclination is the same as the binary inclination , then this would imply a black hole mass of 200  @xcite , which is probably unrealistically high .",
    "thus , either the disk is warped or the inclination is significantly higher than @xmath60 .",
    "these results provide the most direct and quantitative evidence to date for the truncation of the accretion disk for stellar mass black holes in the hard state at low luminosities .",
    "figure  [ fig : r_vs_l]a compares our constraint on @xmath0 at 0.14% @xmath2 to previous measurements at higher luminosities .",
    "the data show that the inner edge of the disk moves sharply outward as the luminosity decreases from 1% to 0.1% @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , the drop in the iron line ew shown in figure  [ fig : r_vs_l]b is consistent with the increase in @xmath0 since one expects the line to become weaker if the disk is truncated . the ew evolution and the fact that the line is well - described by a single component provide support for the interpretation that the narrow line comes from the disk .",
    "considering the broad lines seen in the brighter part of the hard state and the disk truncation that we see here , the overall evolution is very similar to the theoretical prediction that the disk evaporation will start in the middle of the disk and that the entire inner disk will evaporate when the luminosity reaches @xmath90.1% @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "while the study of stellar mass black holes , such as gx  3394 , provides a detailed look at the evolution of @xmath0 , there is iron line evidence for truncated disks around supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . for ngc  4258 , @xcite measure a narrow line with an ew of 45  ev at a luminosity of @xmath66% @xmath2 and infer that @xmath67 .",
    "there is also evidence for a truncated disk in ngc  4593 , and for this agn , there is possible evidence for a change in @xmath0 over a period of 5  yr @xcite .",
    "our finding for gx  3394 is also important because a large increase in @xmath0 is required for the presence of an adaf , and our result makes the adaf model viable for the fainter part of the hard state .",
    "however , it is known that the adaf model does not give a complete physical description of the system since it does not incorporate the compact jet .",
    "these jets have now been detected from gx  3394 in the hard state both when the disk is truncated ( this work ) and when the disk is not truncated @xcite .",
    "the possibility that disk truncation occurs at a different mass accretion rate than the transition to the hard state and the turn - on of the compact jet has not been considered in most theoretical work .",
    "this finding strongly constrains models such as the magnetically - dominated accretion flow ( mdaf ) model @xcite where jet production and properties depend on the accretion geometry .    .",
    "( a ) the constraints on the inner radius of the accretion disk , including all gx  3394 observations made with instruments with energy resolution better than 200  ev for which a determination of @xmath0 was obtained using relativistic reflection models . the four measurements of @xmath0 in the range 25  @xmath10 between 1.3% @xmath2 and 15% @xmath2 use _ suzaku _",
    "@xcite , _ xmm - newton _",
    "@xcite , and _ swift _ @xcite .",
    "the grey 90% confidence upper limit is a _",
    "swift _ measurement where broad features in the reflection component are detected , but the iron line is not clearly detected @xcite .",
    "the dashed line marks the central value obtained at 1215% @xmath2 .",
    "the measurements indicate that a large increase in @xmath0 occurs between 0.5% @xmath2 and 0.14% @xmath2 .",
    "( b ) the equivalent width of the iron line vs. luminosity .",
    "the value we obtain at 0.14% @xmath2 is the lowest value , which is consistent with a drop in the strength of the reflection component due to truncation of the disk .",
