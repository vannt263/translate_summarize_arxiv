    "several strong indications in favor of neutrino masses and mixing have been observed in atmospheric and solar neutrinos . however , direct detection of neutrino masses has not been measured .",
    "the most stringent upper limit obtained by tritium beta decay is @xmath3  ev ( 95% c.l . )",
    "another fundamental question of neutrino physics is the nature of massive neutrinos .",
    "are massive neutrinos dirac particles or neutral majorana particles having all lepton numbers equal to zero ?",
    "the neutrinoless double beta decay @xmath4 which is a process beyond the electroweak standard model , is the only way to prove the existence of majorana neutrinos . in some phenomenologically viable neutrino scenarios ,",
    "the effective majorana neutrino mass @xmath5 can be 0.1 ev ( in a three - neutrino scenario with two mass - degenerate neutrinos ) or even as large as 1 ev ( in a four - neutrino scenario which accomodates all the oscillation measurements ) @xcite .    to date",
    ", the most stringent limit on the @xmath4 half - life is obtained in the @xmath6ge heidelberg - moscow experiment @xcite : @xmath7 from this limit , an upper limit on @xmath5 can be inferred with the relation : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the nuclear matrix element of the relevant isotope and @xmath10 is the phase - space factor .",
    "+ calculations of @xmath9 have unfortunately large theoretical uncertainties . depending on the calculation of @xmath9 ,",
    "one obtains limits on @xmath5 ranging from 0.4 ev to 1 ev @xcite .",
    "the limit @xmath11 1 ev is obtained by using calculations performed in the framework of the shell model @xcite .",
    "@xmath10 is analytically calculable and is proportional to @xmath12 ( @xmath13 for @xmath6ge ) .",
    "therefor to improve the sensitivity of a double-@xmath14 decay experiment , an isotope with a larger @xmath2 seems to be preferable in order to get a larger @xmath10 , but also to reduce the background in the search for a @xmath15 signal .",
    "the aim of the nemo-3 detector , which will operate in the frjus underground laboratory , referred to as the laboratoire souterrain de modane ( lsm ) , is to search for @xmath4 with various isotopes with large q@xmath16 values .",
    "the detector is able to accomodate at least 10 kg of double beta decay isotopes .",
    "much attention has been focused on @xmath0mo ( @xmath2 = 3034 kev ) , @xmath1se ( @xmath2 = 2995 kev ) and @xmath17cd ( @xmath2 = 2802 kev ) .",
    "the nemo-3 experiment is based on the direct detection of the two electrons by a tracking device and on the measurement of their energies by a calorimeter .",
    "the nemo-3 detector , as shown in the figure  [ fig : nemo3 ] , is similar in function to the earlier prototype nemo-2 @xcite .",
    "+ the detector is cylindrical in design and divided into 20 equals sectors .",
    "thin ( @xmath18 ) source foils are fixed vertically between two concentric cylindrical tracking volumes composed of open octagonal drift cells , 270 cm long , operating in geiger mode . in order to minimize multiple scattering effects ,",
    "the tracking volume is filled with a mixture of helium gas and 4% ethyl alcohol .",
    "the wire chamber provides three - dimensional tracking .",
    "the tracking volume is covered with calorimeters made of large blocks of plastic scintillators coupled to very low radioactivity 3  and 5  pmts .",
    "the finished detector contains 6180 drift - geiger cells and 1940 scintillators .",
    "a solenoid surrounding the detector produces a magnetic field of 30 gauss in order to recognize ( @xmath19 ) pair production events in the source foils",
    ". an external shield , in the form of 20 cm thick low radioactivity iron , covers the detector to reduce @xmath20-rays and thermal neutron fluxes . outside of this shield , an additional shield",
    "is added to thermalize fast neutrons .",
    "the construction of the 20 sectors of the nemo-3 detector has been completed .",
    "currently , 12 sectors are in the underground laboratory and 6 of them are equipped with their source foils and mounted on the detector frame .",
    "the detector will be completed by the end of the year 2000 .",
    "the energy resolution of each scintillator block has been measured with a 1 mev electron spectrometer during the construction of the calorimeter .",
    "the energy resolution is @xmath21 at 1 mev which is lower than the energy resolution of 7% at 1 mev specified in the detector s proposal .",
    "the double-@xmath14 decay isotopes which are being mounted in the detector are the following : 7 kg of @xmath0mo ( corresponding to 12 sectors ) , 1 kg of @xmath1se ( 2.3 sectors ) , 0.6 kg of @xmath17cd ( 1 sector ) , 0.7 kg of @xmath22te ( 1.8 sectors ) , 50 g of @xmath23nd , 16 g of @xmath24zr and 8 g of @xmath25ca . also , 2.7 sectors are devoted to external background measurements : 1 sector is equipped with an ultra - pure copper foil and 1.7 sectors with 0.9 kg of @xmath26teo@xmath27 . to date ,",
    "@xmath1se , @xmath17cd , @xmath26teo@xmath27 and the copper foils are mounted .",
    "the choice of cu and @xmath26teo@xmath27 is explained below .",
    "we are now starting to mount the @xmath0mo sources .",
    "three sectors installed on the detector frame have been succesfully running since the end of april 2000 ( without a magnetic field and an external shield ) .",
    "the nemo collaboration has decided to start operating with these 3 sectors in order to test the tracking and calorimeter parts of the detector .",
    "the wire chamber and the pmts coupled to the scintillators are running well and only 0.3% of geiger cells are out - of - order .",
    "geiger @xmath14 tracks obtained with these 3 sectors and with the finalized nemo-3 trigger and acquisition system , are shown in figure  [ fig : event1 ] and [ fig : event2 ] .",
    "there are three origins of expected background which can occur in this search for a @xmath15 signal around 3 mev .",
    "the first background comes from the beta decays of @xmath28bi ( q@xmath29 3.2 mev ) and @xmath30tl ( q@xmath29 5.0 mev ) which are present in the source , from the uranium and thorium decay chains .",
    "they can mimic @xmath31 events by @xmath14 emission followed by m@xmath32ller effect or by a @xmath33 cascade followed by a compton interaction .",
    "thus , the experiment requires ultra - pure enriched @xmath31 isotopes .",
    "a second origin of @xmath15 background is due to high energy gamma rays ( @xmath34 2.6 mev ) interacting with the source foil .",
    "their origin is from neutron captures occuring inside the detector .",
    "the interactions of these gammas in the foil can lead to 2 electrons by @xmath19 pair creation , double compton scattering or compton followed by m@xmath32ller scattering . finally , given the energy resolution , the ultimate background is the tail of the @xmath35 decay distribution .",
    "it defines the half - life limits to which the @xmath15 can be studied .",
    "maximum levels of @xmath28bi and @xmath30tl contamination in the source have been calculated to insure that @xmath35 is the limiting background .",
    "these limits are @xmath28bi @xmath36 0.3 mbq / kg and @xmath30tl @xmath36 0.02 mbq / kg .",
    "these activities in @xmath28bi and @xmath30tl correspond to a level of @xmath37  g / g in @xmath38u and @xmath39  g / g in @xmath40th respectively when we assume the natural radioactive families of @xmath38u and @xmath40th are in equilibrium . to reach these specifications ,",
    "two methods have been developed to purify the enriched molybdenum isotope .",
    "the first method developed by itep ( moscow , russia ) , is a purification by local melting of solid mo with an electron beam and drawing a monocrystal from the liquid portion .",
    "one gets an ultra - pure @xmath0mo monocrystal .",
    "the crystal is then rolled into a metallic foil for use in the detector .",
    "much attention has been focused on this rolling process . to date 0.5 kg of foil has been produced and no contaminant activity have been measured with hp - ge in the lsm .    the second purification method is a chemical process done at ineel ( idaho , usa ) which leaves the mo in a powder form that is then used to produce foils with a binding paste and mylar strips which have been etched with an ion beam and a chemical process . to date 3 kg of @xmath0mo have been purified and 2  kg more are being processed and will be ready towards the end of september 2000 .",
    "no activity has been observed in the purified @xmath0mo after 1 month of hp - ge measurements in the lsm and the most stringent limits obtained for radiopurities are @xmath28bi @xmath36 0.2 mbq / kg and @xmath30tl @xmath36 0.05 mbq / kg .",
    "the radiopurity in @xmath28bi is already better than the design specifications .",
    "the task of measuring the required limits for @xmath30tl is beyond the practical measuring limits of the hp - ge detectors in the lsm .",
    "however , the chemical extraction factors defined as the ratio of contamination before and after purification were measured with a @xmath26mo sample . applying the @xmath30tl extraction factor to the @xmath30tl activity measured in the @xmath0mo before purification , one obtains after purification an expected level in @xmath30tl of 0.01 mbq / kg which is again lower than the design specifications .",
    "some low activities in @xmath28bi and @xmath30tl have been measured in the 1 kg @xmath1se source foils with hp - ge studies .",
    "the activities are 1.2 @xmath41 0.5 mbq / kg in @xmath28bi and 0.4 @xmath41 0.1 mbq / kg in @xmath30tl .",
    "this corresponds to an expected background of 0.2 events / yr / kg from @xmath28bi and 1 event / yr / kg from @xmath30tl .",
    "+ the same contamination had been measured with @xmath1se foils used in the nemo-2 prototype and contaminants were found to be concentrated in small `` hot - spots '' and rejected in the analysis thanks to the tracking device @xcite .",
    "we believe that the contamination in these @xmath1se foils is identical and will be suppressed by software analysis .",
    "the effect of neutrons and @xmath20-rays on the background in the @xmath15 energy region was studied for 10,700 hours of live time with the nemo-2 prototype @xcite .",
    "various shields and measuremements with a neutron source were used to identify the different components .",
    "this study has shown that there is no contribution from thermal neutrons which are stopped in a few centimeters of the iron shielding but that the dominating background is due to fast neutrons ( @xmath34 1 mev ) from the laboratory .",
    "fast neutrons going through the iron shielding , are thermalized in the plastic scintillators and then captured in copper , iron or hydrogen inside the detector . to compare the data and monte carlo calculations , a study required the development of an interface between geant / micap and a new library for @xmath20-ray emission after capture or inelastic scattering of neutrons .",
    "good agreement was obtained between the experiments and simulations .",
    "additionally , the components of the detector have to be ultra - pure in @xmath28bi , @xmath30tl and @xmath42k to have a low background in the @xmath35 energy spectrum .",
    "this is required to not only measure the @xmath35 period with high accuracy but also to see any distortions in the @xmath35 spectrum due to majoron emission .",
    "finally , the high radiopurity is required so that we can measure the @xmath43 and @xmath44 events which identify the tl activity in the source .",
    "the activities of all materials used in the detector were measured with hp - ge detectors in the lsm or at the cenbg laboratory in bordeaux ( france ) .",
    "this exhausting examination of samples , corresponding to about 1000 measurements , reasulted in the rejection of numerous glues , plastics , and metals .",
    "activities in @xmath28bi , @xmath30tl and @xmath42k , of the main components of the detector are listed in table  [ tab : activities ] .",
    "as expected , the radioactive contamination in the detector is dominated by the low radioactivity glass in the pmts .",
    "the activity of these pmts are three orders of magnitude below standard pmt levels . with a total activity of 300  bq for @xmath28bi and 18  bq for @xmath30tl in the 600  kg of pmts , the expected signal - to - background ratio ( @xmath45 ) in the integrated @xmath35 energy spectrum is @xmath46 from @xmath28bi and @xmath47 from @xmath30tl with 7  kg of @xmath0mo ( t@xmath48y ) .",
    "this ratio becomes about 10 times smaller with @xmath1se since its @xmath35 half - life is about 10 times larger ( t@xmath49y ) .",
