    "stars are formed in various environments with different density , temperature , rotation , turbulence , magnetic fields , metallicities , and so on . to take account of these effects , computational simulations including many physical processes have been extensively performed and played leading roles in understanding star formation processes . among these physical processes , metallicities are one of the important parameters which control thermal evolution through radiation transfer .",
    "thermodynamics is of critical importance in dynamics of collapsing clouds ; for instance , the effective adiabatic index @xmath1 is an important criterion whether a gas sphere collapses dynamically by self - gravity .",
    "it is well accepted that the early phase of star formation , from molecular clouds cores to protostellar cores , proceeds through two distinctive stages @xcite .",
    "initially a dense cloud core collapses almost isothermally because radiation cooling is highly efficient .",
    "when the gas gets dense enough and radiation cooling becomes inefficient , the gas pressure balances with gravity and a quasi hydrostatic object , a so - called first core , is formed .",
    "this first core evolves by gas accretion from envelope .",
    "when the gas temperature around the center of the cloud reaches about 2,000k where molecular hydrogen starts to dissociate , the first core becomes unstable and collapses again .",
    "after this second collapse , finally a second core , or a protostellar core , is formed when the dissociation almost completes and the gas becomes stiff again .",
    "modern multi - dimensional simulations with many physical processes including radiation transfer confirmed this scenario @xcite and now it is well established . by the nature of its formation , it is obviously expected that the evolution and properties of first cores depend on radiation transfer and therefore on metallicities . however , it is not very clear how the formed protostars are affected by the different evolution in the early phase .",
    "the effects of metallicities have been studied quite well , especially in the context of formation of the first and second generation stars .",
    "using one - zone approximation or 1d hydrodynamic calculations , the effects of different metallicities on thermal evolution has been investigated elaborately @xcite .",
    "multi - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations with the barotropic approximation using the evolution track obtained in those calculations have been also performed , and conditions and outcomes of fragmentation have been investigated @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "in the context of present - day star formation , @xcite performed radiation hydrodynamic simulations of cluster - scale star formation , and found that the initial mass function is insensitive to the metallicities .",
    "while a statistical study on the large scale was done in their work , their resolution is limited ( @xmath2 ) and optically - thick objects ( i.e. first cores and circumstellar disks ) are not well resolved , where the effects of different metallicities are expected to be more significant .    in this paper ,",
    "i report the results of 3d nested - grid rhd and rmhd simulations of protostellar collapse from molecular cloud cores to protostellar cores with different metallicities . because of the limited physical processes involved in the code , i focus on the @xmath3 models and compare them with the solar abundance models in the context of present - day low - mass star formation .",
    "the main goal of this work is to clarify the effects of the metallicities especially on the structures and evolution of first cores and protostellar cores .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 the numerical methods and setups used in this paper are explained .",
    "the results of the simulations and analyses are shown in ",
    "finally conclusions and discussions are presented in   4 .",
    "i calculate collapse of unstable molecular cloud cores until protostellar cores are formed .",
    "the simulations are performed using the @xmath4 code which includes 3d nested - grid , resistive mhd , self - gravity , radiation transfer and a realistic equation - of - state ( eos ) . in this work ,",
    "i do not use the resistive mhd part and i perform ideal mhd simulations and non - magnetized hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "the detailed description of the code is given in @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) .",
    "the mhd part is solved by the hlld approximate riemann solver @xcite with second - order linear reconstruction .",
    "the solenoidal constraint is numerically enforced using the mixed correction proposed by @xcite . to solve the poisson equation for self - gravity , i use the multi - grid solver @xcite .",
    "the gray flux limited diffusion approximation ( fld ; @xcite ) is adopted for radiation transfer and the radiation subsystem is integrated implicitly .",
    "finally , i use the tabulated equation - of - state which includes the effects of chemical reactions between seven species ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) and internal degrees of freedom ( rotation and vibration ) .",
    "the ortho : para ratio of molecular hydrogen is fixed to be 3:1 .    to simulate low - metallicity clouds ,",
    "the opacity tables are modified from paper i. although dust properties such as the structure , composition and size distribution can depend on the metallicities and other environmental parameters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , i adopt the dust opacity tables provided by @xcite simply assuming that the dust opacities are proportional to the metallicities . for gas opacities ,",
    "i combine the tables of @xcite and @xcite with adequate abundances . in order to isolate the effects of different metallicities , other model parameters , the eos in particular , are kept unchanged . because the contribution from heavy elements is small , the effects of the different metallicities on the eos are small .",
    "note that clouds with @xmath7 can be reasonably simulated with the current code but it is not adequate if the metallicity is below @xmath8 . in clouds with such low metallicities ,",
    "radiation cooling by molecular lines is significant in the relatively low - density region @xcite , but it is not implemented in the code as the dust continuum is assumed to be the dominant opacity source in the low - temperature region",
    ". therefore , here i only study @xmath9 cases and compare them with the solar abundance models .",
    "i use @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 for the solar abundance models , while the low metallicity models are calculated with @xmath10 , @xmath13 .",
    "i calculate six models ; a spherical model , a rotating model without magnetic fields and a magnetized rotating model for each metallicity .",
    "the model parameters are summarized in table .",
    "[ tb : models ] .",
    "the first character of the model corresponds to the initial conditions and the second represents the metallicities . in all the models ,",
    "the bonnor - ebert spheres @xcite with @xmath14 density enhancement are used as the initial conditions .",
    "the central density is @xmath15 , the mass is @xmath16 and the radius is @xmath17 .",
    "rigid - body rotation with @xmath18 is imposed for the rotating models as well as regularlized @xmath19 m=2 perturbation .",
    "finally uniform mangetic fields of @xmath20 aligned to the rotational axis are introduced in the magnetized models .",
    "these initial conditions are similar to the slow rotating models in paper i. the simulations are stopped when the central temperature reaches @xmath21 in the spherical and magnetized models , but the non - magnetized models are stopped at @xmath22 because they take much longer and i could not calculate the evolution after the second collapse long enough .

    "the largest radii are shown when the first and protostellar cores are not spherical .",
    "note that the first and protostellar cores are still evolving and their properties are transient.[tb : restable ]    in this paper , i performed 3d rhd and rmhd simulations of protostellar collapse in low metallicity environments ( @xmath23 ) and compared them with the models with the solar metallicity .",
    "note that the evolutions after dust evaporation in the low metallicity models are largely changed from the presentation at protostars & planets vi because there were errors in the low - metallicity gas opacities . in order to simulate thermodynamics and dynamics in star formation processes , multi - dimensional simulations including radiation transfer are crucial because the thermal evolution is not a simple function of the local gas properties but highly non - linear , non - local and time - dependent .",
    "in particular , the barotropic approximation used in many previous works can not properly reproduce the thermal properties .",
    "the properties of the first cores , protostellar cores and outflows obtained in the simulations are summarized in table .",
    "[ tb : restable ] . in short , the early evolution and structures of the protostellar cores",
    "weakly depend on the metallicities while the first cores are significantly more sensitive to the metallicities .",
    "although i simulated only the earliest evolution of the protostellar cores , these results are useful as input for further stellar evolution studies .",
    "the detailed findings in this work are summarized as follows :    \\1 .",
    "the first cores in the low - metallicity environments are colder because of more efficient radiation cooling . as a result ,",
    "the low - metal first cores have smaller radii , masses and shorter lifetimes .",
    "therefore , first cores are less likely to be found in low - metallicity environments .",
    "the first cores and protostellar cores in the ideal mhd models are very similar to those in the spherical models , except for the outflows .",
    "this is because of the efficient angular momentum transport by magnetic fields .",
    "the molecular outflows in the mhd models are very similar in their speeds and morphologies because the thermodynamics does not affect the driving mechanism of the outflows .",
    "the different sizes of the outflows at the end of the first core phase are simply due to their lifetimes .    \\4 . in the spherical and the ideal mhd models ,",
    "the properties of the formed protostellar cores are not very sensitive to the metallicities .",
    "this is solely a consequence of the dissociation and ionization of hydrogen and therefore quite general ( see appendix for the theoretical explanation ) .",
    "since typical magnetic fields observed in star forming clouds are strong enough ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , the metallicity - dependencies of the protostellar cores are expected to be small at least when they are very young , while the first cores are more sensitive to the metallicities .",
    "\\5 . when there is rotation but no or very weak magnetic fields , the first cores form disks supported by rotation .",
    "as they evolve more slowly , the disks become significantly colder than the first cores in the spherical models due to radiation cooling .",
    "the effects of radiation cooling is more prominent in the low metallicity environments . as a result",
    ", considerable differences may appear in the protostellar cores compared to the spherical and magnetized cases .",
    "although the first cores in this work have not fragmented , these results indicate that the disks would be more susceptible to the gravitational instability and fragmentation in the low - metallicity environments .",
    "naively speaking , this implies a higher binary rate and probability of planetary - mass companions , which is qualitatively consistent with the previous simulations using the barotropic approximation @xcite . note that",
    ", however , this is not trivial because the initial conditions can depend on the metallicities .    in order to predict the outcomes of star formation processes such as the initial mass function and the binary or multiple rates , it is crucial to convolve the initial distributions and the outcome of each formation process .",
    "as these results are just case studies on the early phases of the specific models , more broad parameter survey and long - term calculations are obviously required . for example",
    ", the initial rotation and magnetic fields are very important because the angular momentum and its transport are crucial in the evolution of the disks .",
    "besides , the mass of the initial molecular cloud also has significant impact .",
    "the radiation cooling effects would be more significant in the low mass clouds because the evolution is slower due to the lower accretion rate @xcite .",
    "although current observations of low metallicity star forming regions are limited , future observations of star forming clouds in the outer regions of our galaxy or nearby satellites like smc and lmc will be useful to understand the effects of metallicities .    as a future work ,",
    "the effects of metallicities on non - ideal mhd effects are important and interesting . while the ohmic dissipation extends the first core lifetimes slightly by suppressing the angular momentum transport ( paper i ) , the ionization degree and resulting resistivity themselves depend on the metallicities . in the relatively low - density region where cosmic rays predominantly contribute to ionization",
    ", the ionization degree would be higher and the resistivity would be lower than in the solar metallicity environments . on the other hand , in the relatively high density region , typically the interior of first cores , decay of radioactive nuclei is the dominant ionization source .",
    "therefore , the ionization degree could decrease and the non - ideal mhd could be more effective .",
    "also , as the abundance of potassium is smaller , the re - coupling due to the thermal ionization of potassium ( k ) would occur at a slightly higher density .",
    "thus , the non - ideal mhd effects are not trivial and detailed studies are required .",

    "i only discuss hydrogen gas as contribution of helium is small .",
    "suppose two adiabatic tracks with the same number of hydrogen atoms but different entropies contracting from fully molecular gas to fully ionized gas .",
    "track a starts from the initial state @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) and ends at the final state @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , while track b starts from @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) and ends at @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the entropy difference between the tracks can be estimated by considering isochoric processes @xmath32 and @xmath33 : @xmath34 for simplicity , let us assume the heat capacity is constant during these processes and neglect non - ideal effects such as chemical reactions and interaction between particles . then , the entropy difference is estimated to be @xmath35 this indicates that the temperature difference is smaller when @xmath36 is larger , and it is most significant during the second collapse because dissociation of molecular hydrogen involves a huge latent heat and increases @xmath36 . at @xmath24 and @xmath28 where the temperatures are so low ( @xmath37 ) that rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom are not excited , the heat capacity is @xmath38 , where n is the number of particles . at @xmath26 and @xmath30 where",
    "hydrogen is completely dissociated and ionized ( @xmath39 ) , the heat capacity is also @xmath40 . because the two tracks are adiabatic ,",
    "the entropy difference is constant everywhere .",
    "therefore a simple relation between the temperature ratios is derived : @xmath41 as the gas is fully molecular in the initial states and fully ionized in the final states , @xmath42 ( it is possible to improve this estimate by considering contribution from helium ) .",
    "finally , @xmath43    therefore , the temperature ratio after the second collapse is much smaller than that before the second collapse . the temperature ratio between the two tracks in fig .  [ lm_rhot ]",
    "starting from @xmath44 and @xmath45 is @xmath46 at @xmath47 , while it is @xmath48 at @xmath49 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the theoretical prediction , @xmath50 , but slightly deviates from the prediction probably because of the neglected effects including contribution from helium and its ionization .",
    "because this significant effect is solely a consequence of thermodynamics and chemical reactions , it leads to a quite general prediction ; as long as radiative loss during the second collapse is small ( although this might not be the case in the non - magnetized rotating models discussed in the text ) , formed protostellar cores only weakly depend on the initial conditions ."
