    "the continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) theory was introduced more than forty years ago @xcite to extend regular random walks on lattices to a continuous time variable .",

    "the ctrw model was championed in the seminal work on charge carrier transport in amorphous semiconductors @xcite .",
    "ctrw theory has also been successfully applied in subsurface tracer dispersion @xcite , tick - tick dynamics in financial markets @xcite , cardiological rhythms @xcite , electron transfer @xcite , noise in plasma devices @xcite , dispersion in turbulent systems @xcite , search models @xcite , or in models of gene regulation @xcite , among many others @xcite .",
    "ctrw models are closely related to the fractional fokker - planck equation @xcite .",
    "the independence of the waiting times and jump lengths giving rise to a renewal process is not always justified .",

    "an important application are search processes and human motion patterns in which memory and conscience will likely lead to a non - renewal situation .",
    "a general mathematical framework was developed for non - independent ctrws @xcite , however , it is quite cumbersome to apply and the cases solved so far only lead back to normal diffusion .",
    "an approach to coupling of waiting times based on the langevin equation formulation of ctrw processes was recently introduced @xcite .",
    "some special cases were explored that bridge between ctrw and fractional brownian motion @xcite . here",

    "it is quite hard to compute this quantity , and this is why in previous literature only normal diffusion was treated in this framework .",
    "instead of constructing the process from definitions ( [ correl ] ) and ( [ joint ] ) we start from a different angle .",
    "namely we build the value of waiting time @xmath17 from the previous waiting time plus a random deviation @xmath27 , @xmath28 the sequence of waiting times can therefore be viewed as a random walk in the space of waiting times .",
    "similarly we will proceed with coupled jump lengths below . the waiting time",

    "we stress again that this subdiffusion emerges from a random process that has a finite waiting time in each step .",
