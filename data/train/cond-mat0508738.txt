    "although mssbauer data suggest a first - order transition at @xmath6  @xcite , the specific heat and susceptibility measurements that establish the phase diagram show no evidence for a discontinuous jump or hysteresis at the transition for any field , suggesting that all transitions are of second order .",

    "our measurements suggest that similar cooperative paramagnetism characterizes the high - temperature phase of gd@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "in general the muon relaxation rate  @xmath17 in a paramagnet is given by  @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the spatial fourier transform of the transferred hyperfine interaction between a muon and the paramagnetic spin system , @xmath20 is the dissipative component of the complex spin susceptibility , and @xmath21 is the muon zeeman frequency , where @xmath22 is the muon gyromagnetic ratio . in the sum over",

    "if @xmath19 depends significantly on * q * , the effective weighting changes as @xmath20 evolves from a * q*-independent form at high temperatures ( appropriate to independently - fluctuating local moments ) to a form with a peak at the ordering wave vector as the transition is approached .",
    "the physical picture for this behavior is that the fluctuating local field at a given muon site is the resultant of transferred hyperfine fields from a number of neighboring spins , and will therefore be modified by any change in spatial correlation between the fluctuations of these neighboring spins .    if either @xmath23 or @xmath20 is substantially independent of * q *",
    ", however , the temperature and field dependencies of @xmath17 reflect those of the local dissipative susceptbility  @xmath24 .",
    "the * q * dependence of @xmath25 can be estimated qualitatively by comparing the paramagnetic - state hyperfine field  @xmath26 , which gives an estimate of the effective coupling for uncorrelated spins , with the zero - field @xmath7sr frequency or frequencies observed in the magnetically ordered state , which yield the effective coupling for the ordered - state spin configuration .    in gd@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 @xmath27 from transverse - field @xmath7sr experiments at high temperatures  @xcite . in the magnetically ordered state , where gd moments are oriented parallel to local @xmath28 directions  @xcite",
    ", two muon frequencies , @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( assuming an ordered gd@xmath8 moment of @xmath31 ) , are observed in zero applied field  @xcite .",
    "the coupling strengths in the paramagnetic and magnetically ordered states do not differ by orders of magnitude .",
    "this indicates that @xmath19 is roughly independent of * q * , and suggests that the temperature and field dependencies of @xmath17 are roughly those of @xmath32 [ cf .",

    "this yields @xmath38 as the muon zeeman frequency  @xmath39 is swept through the singular spin - fluctuation noise spectrum  @xcite . for @xmath40  @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the rms fluctuating field at the muon site .",

    "1 we find a much smaller value , @xmath44 , in gd@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 close to @xmath6 .",
    "this may reflect a larger value of @xmath45 and/or a larger coupling field  @xmath42 in gd@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the crossover to @xmath46 for @xmath47 suggests that there is a cutoff of @xmath35 at long times  @xmath48  s. that is , the time dependence of @xmath35 has the more general form  @xmath49 expected near a phase transition  @xcite , with a cutoff time  @xmath50 two orders of magnitude longer than the time scale  @xmath51  s associated with the transition .",

    "similar behavior is generally observed in the neighborhood of a magnetic transition , and is interpreted as evidence for critical slowing down of the spin fluctuations ( i.e. , divergence of @xmath50 ) . in gd@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , however , this rate increase is suppressed by applied field . at first sight",
    "this is surprising , because the high- and low - temperature phases are separated by a line of second - order phase transitions  @xcite , and critical slowing down would be expected at any applied field as the transition line is approached .",
    "the apparent suppression of critical slowing down is , however , consistent with the cutoff power - law divergence scenario outlined above : for @xmath53 the power - law behavior of @xmath35 , not the divergence of @xmath50 , controls @xmath17 .",
    "critical slowing down would not be suppressed in systems where @xmath50 is sufficiently small , i.e. , @xmath54 for measurements at applied field  @xmath10 ( cf .",
    "fig .  2 ) .",
    "our results suggest that spin fluctuations above the magnetic phase transition in gd@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 are associated with cooperative paramagnetic behavior similar to that found in ( tb@xmath14y@xmath15)@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  @xcite , with the difference that a long - time cutoff causes saturation of the fluctuation spectrum at low frequencies ( low applied fields ) .",
    "it is the anomalously low frequency of this crossover that suppresses the critical slowing down and permits observation of the high - field power - law field dependence . to our knowledge this behavior has not been anticipated theoretically .",
