    "it is rare in the theory of turbulence that one can make quantitative predictions @xcite . in this paper",
    "we manage to provide complete , quantitative predictions on spatial behavior of particles driven by the turbulent navier - stokes flow @xmath3 according to the law @xmath4 \\right)/\\tau+ \\bm g,\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the particle s coordinate , @xmath6 is the stokes relaxation time and @xmath7 is the gravitational acceleration . we demonstrate that when the ratio @xmath0 of typical acceleration of fluid particles to @xmath1 is much less than one then the particles distribute over multi - fractal structure in space .",
    "this prediction holds independently of properties of particles such as @xmath6 .",
    "further the statistics of the spatial concentration of particles is log - normal .",
    "the spectrum of fractal codimensions @xcite is linear @xmath8 where @xmath2 is the kaplan - yorke dimension @xcite . in the particular case where @xmath6 is comparable with time - scales of turbulence one finds @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the spectrum of turbulence .",
    "thus @xmath2 determines the ( fractal ) statistics of spatial distribution of particles completely .",
    "its @xmath11 independence signifies universality of spatial distribution of particles which becomes independent of particles size or density in @xmath12 limit .",
    "in particular the pair - correlation function of the particles concentration @xmath13 ( preferential concentration ) is @xmath14 where angular brackets stand for spatial averaging and @xmath15 is the smallest , kolmogorov scale of turbulence @xcite . though @xmath16 is small the preferential concentration is arbitrarily large when @xmath17 .",
    "finally we describe completely the spectrum of the lyapunov exponents @xmath18 that provide the logarithmic rates of growth of the axes of the ellipsoid into which turbulence deforms small volumes of particles , @xmath19 thus @xmath20 $ ] is universal constant that is independent of properties of particles , turbulence or @xmath1 .",
    "the largest axis of the ellipsoid grows ( @xmath21 ) but the smaller ones decrease ( @xmath22 ) signifying that turbulence transforms small volumes of inertial particles into cigars ( in contrast , small volumes of fluid particles for which @xmath23 are transformed into pancakes ) .",
    "we confirm the predictions numerically .",
    "we demonstrate the transition in @xmath0 from singular density with @xmath24 like in eq .",
    "( [ pref ] ) to continuous one with finite @xmath25 .",
    "when the dimensionless stokes number @xmath26 measuring the particle s inertia @xmath6 is fixed at @xmath27 the increase of @xmath0 from small values brings the transition at @xmath28 .",
    "this is quite similar to the transition in @xmath26 when gravity can be neglected @xcite . when @xmath29 the particles distribution is singular independently of @xmath0 .",
    "the described results provide significant progress to the well - studied area .",
    "the asymptotic independence of a fractal dimension on @xmath26 was found in numerical simulations in @xcite ( see statement of independent work below ) , see also @xcite .",
    "when gravity is strong , a new pattern of vertical clustering of sedimenting particles was recently observed @xcite .",
    "however , no predictions comparable to eqs .",
    "( [ kapyork])-([spctr ] ) that are confirmed numerically were known so far .",
    "this is possible thanks to the observation @xcite that when @xmath12 the particle s velocity is determined uniquely by its position so that there is well - defined flow of particles @xmath30 .",
    "in contrast to the cases considered previously there is no explicit formula for @xmath30 via @xmath3 . despite this",
    "we manage to perform the study using recently found @xcite universality in the distribution of particles in weakly compressible flows , see below .",
    "remarkably the case of @xmath12 is rather typical for water droplets in warm clouds so that the described results are of direct practical relevance .",
    "inhomogeneity ( preferential concentration ) in the steady state distribution of particles in space originates from the particle s drift outside of turbulent vortices @xcite .",
    "this drift , however small it is , can have large impact on the spatial distribution of particles because it accumulates with time .",
    "this becomes clear by considering inertial particles in simple rotation flow in which inertia - less particles would circle forever but inertial ones drift to the flow region s boundary .",
    "thus results of evolution of uniform initial distributions of inertial and inertialess particles are completely different : inertial particles will be on the boundary with zero volume , inertialess ones will stay uniformly distributed over all the volume .",
    "similar physical mechanisms are at work in turbulence whose vortices can be considered as rotation regions with boundaries serving as centers of accumulation of particles .",
    "these mechanisms continue to apply when gravity is relevant to particles motion .",
    "the crucial question is whether the finite life - time of turbulent vortices will destroy the accumulation of inhomogeneities that holds for simple rotation .",
    "lots of research was devoted to the study of the posed question recently @xcite .",
    "it results from these studies that the well - established paradigm that the turbulent flow mixes small particles all over the available volume of the flow ( see e. g. @xcite and references therein ) , can only be applied with a reservation .",
    "when the resolution at which the particles distribution in space is resolved is increased , it turns out that the flow distributes the particles over a random strange attractor - a multi - fractal set in space @xcite . instead of filling the whole volume point particles",
    "concentrate on set with zero volume quite like particles in simple rotation flow .",
    "this conclusion gets less paradoxical , when one observes that mixing presumes coarse - graining of the particles density over an infinitesimal scale : otherwise the particles form an intricate set which is dense in space but is not the whole space , see e. g. @xcite .",
    "inertia causes the coarse - graining scale over which the mixing holds to have a finite lower limit @xmath31 . at scales smaller than @xmath31 the particles density is extremely non - uniform , being singular for point particles .",
    "this is the result of accumulation in time of the repel of inertial particles by turbulent vortices which produces a non - trivial spatial distribution @xcite .",
    "since real particles always have inertia , the effect has much practical importance for a wide variety of natural phenomena and industrial processes , such as rain formation in clouds @xcite , aerosols spread out in the atmosphere @xcite , planetary physics @xcite , transport of materials by air or by liquids @xcite , liquid fuel combustion engines @xcite , plankton population dynamics @xcite and more .",
    "thus in any concrete application one should evaluate @xmath31 to decide whether the particles should be considered as being mixed by the flow , or rather transported to a non - trivial multi - fractal set in space .",
    "recently a complete description of the statistics of the particles density at small particle s size was provided in @xcite by using considerations independent of any modeling of the turbulent flow and thus applying to the navier - stokes turbulence .",
    "the statistics of the density field is log - normal and it can be derived fully from the pair - correlation function .",
    "the analysis neglected gravity and relied on the existence of the velocity field of the particles that prescribes uniquely the velocity of the particle in terms of its position @xcite .",
    "the field exists if the dimensionless stokes number , @xmath26 , given by the ratio of the relaxation time of the particle s velocity to the smallest kolmogorov time - scale of turbulence @xcite , is small .",
    "since @xmath26 is proportional to the square of the particle s size , the study applies to small particles .",
    "the influence of the remaining dimensionless parameter - the reynolds number @xmath32 is to strengthen the formation of the fractal so it gets pronounced at smaller stokes numbers : fractal co - dimensions are proportional to the product of @xmath33 and a power of @xmath32 with positive , albeit small , exponent @xmath34 , see @xcite and references therein . due to the smallness of @xmath34 the dependence on @xmath32",
    "can be often disregarded . when @xmath35 the particles move through the flow quasi - ballistically rapidly traversing the vortices .",
    "in this paper , we study the impact of gravity on the particles preferential concentration in space .",
    "this is demanded to apply the theory to nature .",
    "gravitational settling causes the particles to sample vortices differently producing a new kind of preferential concentration that only recently started to be studied , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "we determine the asymptotic range of @xmath26 and @xmath0 for which the particles form fractal in space .",
    "we observe that this range coincides asymptotically with the range of definability of the flow of particles where the particle s velocity is determined uniquely by its spatial position .",
    "indeed , the velocity becomes ill - defined when particles inertia causes the particles to detach from the flow and move ballistically destroying the fractal structure .",
    "this way of dealing with the problem of structure formation was introduced in @xcite and developed for the problem with gravity in @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that the condition that the velocity field is definable @xcite and thus the fractal is formed is @xmath36\\ll 1 $ ] .",
    "this transforms to the known condition @xmath29 at zero gravity .",
    "thus gravity allows to have situations where the velocity field is definable even at @xmath37 , where the particle s velocity relaxation time is comparable to the characteristic time - scale of turbulent eddies in the inertial range .",
    "gravity damps particles detachment from the flow @xcite .",
    "in the case of @xmath27 the particles velocity field is not close to the velocity field of the ambient fluid and it can not be expressed in terms of the latter in the closed form .",
    "we show that one can prove the existence of the velocity field , even not being able to write down an explicit expression for it .",
    "while it could seem that the mere existence of the field is not sufficient to reach definite conclusions , we show that this is not the case .",
    "we observe that if the velocity field is definable , then it must be weakly compressible , cf .",
    "this observation allows us to use the recent results on the universal properties of the stationary distributions of particles in the weakly compressible velocity field @xcite .",
    "those demonstrate that one can describe completely the statistics of particles density in terms of just one dimensionless number @xmath2 characterizing the statistics of turbulence .",
    "the analysis involves no modelling and gives testable predictions .",
    "we confirm the predictions by numerical simulations .",
    "determination of the range of @xmath26 and @xmath0 for which the particles form random fractal in space is basic question on the inertial particles behaviour in turbulence .",
    "remind that when gravity is negligible , @xmath38 , the fractal holds at @xmath39 where @xmath40 , while at larger @xmath26 the particles fill the whole space , albeit inhomogeneously @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , if particles stick to the flow too much , @xmath29 , the flow mixes them efficiently , while if they are too heavy , @xmath37 , they move almost ballistically ignoring the action of vortices on them and tending to spread uniformly .",
    "we observe that the range of @xmath29 for which one can define the particles velocity field is asymptotically the same as the one for which the particles form fractal in space . this is because if the velocity field is definable , then it is compressible implying the existence of the fractal . using similar considerations at @xmath41",
    ", our result suggests that the fractal exists at @xmath36\\lesssim 1 $ ] and does not exist at @xmath36\\gg 1 $ ] .",
    "we provide the spectrum of fractal dimensions at @xmath36\\ll 1 $ ] , consider the limits of weak and strong gravity and give a number of experimentally testable predictions some of which we confirm numerically .",
    "we consider small spherical particle with radius @xmath42 and material density @xmath43 suspended in the fluid with density @xmath44 and kinematic viscosity @xmath45 . the fluid flow @xmath3 is assumed to be incompressible .",
    "we assume that the particle s position @xmath5 and velocity @xmath46 obey the single - particle approximation where one can neglect the interaction between the particles and their back reaction on the flow .",
    "further it is taken that the particle is sufficiently small so the fluid s force on the particle can be described by linear stokes drag .",
    "the consideration of the reynolds number of the flow perturbation due to the drift of the water droplet in the warm cloud performed below demonstrates that the linear drag law holds well at droplet sizes smaller than @xmath47 .",
    "the newton law governing the evolution of the particle position @xmath5 and the particle velocity @xmath46 takes the form @xmath48 - \\bm v(t)}{\\tau } + \\bm g,\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the stokes relaxation time of the particle s velocity , @xmath49 , see @xcite .",
    "after transients , the particle velocity is given by @xmath50 exp \\left ( \\frac{t'-t}{\\tau } \\right ) dt',\\ ] ] where we introduced the settling velocity in the absence of turbulence , @xmath51 .",
    "using this equation one can write the drift velocity @xmath52 $ ] as @xmath53\\!-\\!\\bm u[t , \\bm x(t)]\\right)\\exp \\left ( \\frac{t'-t}{\\tau } \\right ) , \\nonumber\\ ] ] where the last term describes the drift due to the inability of the particle to follow turbulent eddies with time - scale smaller than reaction time @xmath6 .",
    "the smallest characteristic time - scale of turbulence is @xmath54 which is the characteristic time - scale of the turbulent fluctuations at the smallest scale of spatial variations of turbulence , the kolmogorov scale @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "it obeys @xmath55 where @xmath45 is the kinematic viscosity and @xmath56 is the viscous energy dissipation per unit volume .",
    "the characteristic value of the turbulent velocity gradients is @xmath57 .",
    "if the stokes number defined by the ratio of @xmath6 and @xmath58 obeys @xmath59 then there are no eddies with time - scale smaller or of the order of @xmath6 .",
    "thus if gravity can be disregarded then the particle would follow the flow closely with @xmath60 $ ] , see @xcite , so that @xmath61 .",
    "when gravity is relevant one can write @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "in contrast if @xmath27 then there are turbulent eddies with time - scale smaller or of the order of the reaction time @xmath6 producing the drift velocity which is roughly the characteristic velocity of the eddies with time - scale @xmath6 , see @xcite for detailed discussion . within the kolmogorov theory where all properties in the inertial range are determined by @xmath56 the characteristic velocity of the eddies with time - scale @xmath6 is @xmath63 .",
    "it follows that the drift is dominated by the largest of the contributions @xmath64 and @xmath65 so one has @xmath66 $ ] .",
    "similarly one can consider the case of @xmath6 which is much larger than the integral time - scale of turbulence which is beyond our scope here .",
    "it follows that the minimal timescale of variations of the turbulent velocity @xmath67 $ ] in the particle reference frame is of order @xmath68 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath69 is the time during which the particle drifts through that smallest scale of spatial variations of turbulence .",

    "the time - scale @xmath75 defines the remaining dimensionless parameter of the problem , the froude number , @xmath76 .",
    "note that this parameter is independent of the parameters of the particles : @xmath77 $ ] describes the ratio of @xmath15 to the distance passed by the particle accelerating at @xmath1 within the viscous time - scale @xmath58 ( this definition of the froude number is traditional in the area , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one can write @xmath78 $ ] .",
    "the froude number is independent of the parameters of the particles so it can be used to talk of various situations of turbulence irrespective of the particles .",
    "we consider the case of turbulence in warm clouds using the air viscosity @xmath79 .",
    "one finds @xmath80 where @xmath56 is measured in @xmath81 .",
    "using as the upper bound @xmath82 for stratocumulus clouds and @xmath83 for cumulus ones , see @xcite and references therein , one finds @xmath84 for stratocumulus clouds and @xmath85 for cumulus clouds .",
    "thus the froude number typical for warm clouds is very small signifying large role of gravity ( the other dimensionless parameter @xmath26 grows quadratically with the particle radius . for droplets with size @xmath86 one",
    "has @xmath87 ) .",
    "we will see that the smallness of @xmath0 guarantees that multi - streaming of particles has low probability so that there is a well - defined flow of particles .",
    "in contrast , using for clouds @xmath88 considered in @xcite one finds @xmath89 which is not small so it is likely that the multi - streaming is rather typical and there is no well - defined particles flow .",
    "in fact it was found in @xcite that the sling effect is relevant so that the spatial motion of the particles can not be described by flow .",
    "it seems that @xmath83 is a rough upper limit for the possibility to introduce the flow of particles . in the discussion below",
    "we consider clouds with @xmath90 which seems to fit the typical situations see @xcite and references therein .",
    "similar considerations can be performed in water where using @xmath91 one has @xmath92 where @xmath56 is measured in @xmath81 . in this case",
    "significantly smaller @xmath56 than those considered above hold in typical aquatic environments .",

    "see @xcite and references therein",
    ". using the previous estimates for @xmath0 we find that @xmath110 for stratocumulus clouds and @xmath111 for cumulus ones .",
    "thus we have @xmath112 for stratocumulus clouds and @xmath113 for cumulus clouds .",
    "we observe that the situation of @xmath114 is possible . in this case",
    "the gravitational settling of the particles at the speed @xmath96 constitutes significant part of their spatial motion .",
    "in particular , the situation @xmath115 is quite possible where turbulence provides small corrections to the settling .",
    "nevertheless we will see that the preferential concentration of the particles occurs predominantly at scales smaller than @xmath15 .",
    "one has to distinguish the instantaneous pattern of spatial motion where the particles can concentrate in particular regions due to peculiarities of the large - scale motion from the persistent preferential concentration in particular flow regions . in particular , the theory described below is largely independent of whether @xmath116 is smaller or larger than @xmath117 though the overall pattern of the particles motion is strongly different in the two cases",
    "the approach of this work to the solution of the particle s equations of motion ( [ newton ] ) is via the introduction of the spatial flow .",

    "this set can be characterized uniquely by one number - the kaplan - yorke codimension @xmath2 .",
