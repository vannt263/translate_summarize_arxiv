    "note that the solid curve in figure [ fig_nu_vs_ra ] is no fit !    a much better way to check whether the obtained prefactors of the theory agree with the measured ones is to do a linear regression of the straight line as offered in figure [ fig_leo ] .",

    "remember that the only experimental input from this experiment into the theory is @xmath206 .",

    "for @xmath20 they found @xmath220 in the regime @xmath221 and @xmath222 in @xmath223 .",
    "we have no idea about the origin of the measured scaling exponents .",
    "more recently , xin et al .",
    "@xcite , xin and xia @xcite , and qiu and xia @xcite measured the thickness of the kinetic bl in a water cell in a more direct way .",
    "they define @xmath217 as the distance from the wall at which the extrapolation of the linear part of the velocity profile @xmath219 equals the maximum velocity @xmath224 , the velocity of the large scale wind . in the interval",
    "@xmath225 they find @xmath226 for the thickness of the top and bottom kinetic bl @xcite and @xmath227 for the thickness of the kinetic bls at the side walls @xcite .",
    "the first exponent ( for the top and the bottom plates ) is different from the value of this theory @xmath228 .",
    "we can only speculate on the origin of this discrepancy .",
    "perhaps , if @xmath217 is defined as the distance of the velocity maximum to the wall , the @xmath2-scaling would be different .",
    "the power law for the thickness of the kinetic bls at the side walls , however , is well in agreement with the expectation @xmath228 .    in any case",
    ", the experimentally found very weak dependence of @xmath217 on @xmath2 supports the assumed _ laminar _ nature of the kinetic bl .",
    "if the width of the bl were identified with the width @xmath213 of the viscous sublayer of a _ turbulent _ bl , one would expect a stronger dependence on @xmath1 , namely @xmath229 @xcite , i.e. , when neglecting logarithmic corrections , one would have @xmath230 .      according to the presented theory with the chosen prefactors the breakdown of laminarity in the shear bl happens at @xmath231 for @xmath79 and @xmath232 for @xmath43 .",
    "these values are calculated from table [ tab_bounds ] .",
    "hitherto , there are no experiments for these regimes .",
    "however , one may want to argue that the transition to a turbulent shear bl may already occur earlier , be it because of a different aspect ratio , or , in view of more recent work @xcite , because the critical reynolds number ( which we had assumed to be 420 , cf .",
    "( [ s2 ] ) ) is smaller , or because of a different choice of the experimental input information to which the prefactors of the theory are adopted .",
    "e.g. , if one assumes a laminar shear layer with width @xmath233 as suggested by landau and lifshitz ( ref .",
    "@xcite , section 39 ) for the ( related ) case of a flat plate shear flow , the transition to turbulence in the shear bl already occurs at @xmath234 ( for @xmath235 ) .",
    "we note that this is just at about that @xmath2 number where a marked transition in the ( thermal ) dissipative spectral power has been measured by a probe placed in the bl @xcite .",
    "this transition was towards a weaker increase with @xmath2 .    in the context of this section",
    "we also interpret the above mentioned recent experiment by ciliberto et al .",
    "@xcite in which the boundary layers are disturbed by constructing a rough bottom plate with a mean roughness comparable to the thermal boundary layer thickness .",
    "the experiments are performed in water . according to the theory of this paper one would expect larger bulk contributions to both the thermal and the kinetic dissipation and therefore an earlier onset of regime @xmath236 and @xmath237 .",
    "indeed , experimentally the increase of @xmath0 with @xmath2 is found to be much steeper . for the experiment described by ciliberto et al .",
    "@xcite the data can be fitted to power laws @xmath238 or @xmath239 , depending on the features of the rough bottom and upper plate .",
    "we summarize the central ingredients of the theory presented in this paper : the scaling laws for the nusselt number and the reynolds number are based on the decomposition of the global thermal and kinetic energy dissipation rates into their bl and bulk contributions .",
    "these in turn are estimated from the dynamical equations , taking the wind @xmath240 as the relevant velocity in the heat conduction cell .",
    "the resulting estimates are inserted into the rigorous relations eqs .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq12 ] ) for the global kinetic and thermal energy dissipation , respectively .",
    "four regimes arise , depending on whether the bulk or the bl contributions dominate the two global dissipations .",
    "each of the four regimes in principle divides into two subregimes , depending on whether the thermal bl ( of width @xmath241 ) or the kinetic bl ( of width @xmath217 ) is more extended .",
    "in addition to these main regimes there is a range for very large @xmath3 numbers in which the wind reynolds number is @xmath242 ; here the whole flow is viscosity dominated , and the theory looses its applicability .",
    "there also is the range of very small @xmath3 numbers in which the @xmath0 goes down to @xmath243 , and again the theory no longer holds .",
    "finally , for large @xmath2 the laminar kinetic bl becomes turbulent . beyond turbulence onset",
    "we feel the flow is bulk dominated .",
    "all scaling exponents follow from this theory .",
    "if one in addition introduces only four pieces of experimental information , also all the prefactors can be determined .",
    "therefore the theory has predictive power not only for the power law exponents but also for the prefactors . these , however , depend on the chosen experimental information input . to nail the prefactors more input information for various aspect ratios",
    "is necessary .",
    "the phase diagram of the theory , the main result of this work , is shown in figure [ fig_sketch ] . the power laws with the prefactors based on the chosen experimental information are summarized in table [ tab_scal_laws ] , the power laws of the boundaries between the different regimes in table [ tab_bounds ] .",
    "a detailed comparison of the theoretical power law exponents _ and _ the prefactors with the experimental data gives reasonable and encouraging agreement .",
    "we emphasize that to accurately account for the dependences of @xmath0 and @xmath1 on @xmath2 and @xmath3 single power laws are often not sufficient , as additive corrections from neighboring regimes can be considerable .",
    "this can be viewed as one of the main insights obtained in this paper .",
    "a particularly striking example is that @xmath19 mimicks a @xmath84 power law scaling over at least _",
    "nine _ order of magnitude in @xmath2 , see figure [ nu_vs_ra_log_2733 ] .",
    "the theory also offers a possible explanation why a transition to a steeper increase of @xmath0 vs @xmath2 is seen in the chavanne et al .",
    "data @xcite , but not in the chicago group data @xcite .",
    "it may be that in the large @xmath2 chicago experiments the @xmath3 number was smaller than in the chavanne et al .",
    "@xcite measurements .",
    "then for the chicago data one had to expect a transition towards regime @xmath77 where the @xmath2 scaling exponent is @xmath244 and thus , as demonstrated , in superposition with the leading @xmath26 exponent , is indistinguishable from a @xmath84 scaling . in the chavanne et al .",
    "@xcite experiments , on the other hand , one has the transition to the large @xmath3 number regime @xmath78 where the @xmath2 scaling exponent is @xmath94 which is much better distinguishable from @xmath26 .",
    "whether this explanation is true remains to be seen .",
    "finally , we want to stress and discuss one of the basic assumptions of the theory , namely , that a large scale `` wind of turbulence '' exists , defining the reynolds number @xmath245 , creating a shear bl and stirring the turbulence in the bulk .",
    "clearly , this assumptions breaks down in the shaded area in figure [ fig_sketch ] beyond the line @xmath246 where the flow is viscosity dominated .",
    "but even below this line we do not exclude that the convection rolls break down and that the heat is exclusively transported by the fluctuations .",
    "e.g. , for a water cell ( @xmath24 ) tanaka and miyata @xcite do not note the wind of turbulence , in contrast to zocchi et al .",
    "@xcite , who do observe the wind of turbulence in their experiment with only a slightly lower aspect ratio .",
    "also all latest experiments with various aspect ratios doubtlessly detect the wind of turbulence @xcite whose existence we therefore consider as a weak  and in particular controllable  assumption .",
    "the present theory does _ not _ make any statement _ how _ the heat is transported from the bottom to the top , i.e. , whether it is mainly convective transport or mainly transport through plumes @xcite . both processes may contribute , as both create thermal and viscous dissipation .    for even larger prandtl numbers @xmath247 , the spontaneous formation of a wind of turbulence may seem more and more unlikely . to initiate such a wind so that the presented theory can be applied and results can be compared we suggest to slightly tilt the rb cell , thus breaking the symmetry and creating a preferred direction for the wind of turbulence .",
    "if this wind of turbulence can be created , we are confident that the suggested theory holds .",
    "presently , we do not have any experimental information which contradicts the theory .",
    "however , for further verification more experiments will be valuable",
