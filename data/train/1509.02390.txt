    "on the microscale , the motion and deformation of closed soft elastic objects through a viscous fluid at low reynolds numbers , either by a driving force or in a hydrodynamic flow , represents an important problem with numerous applications , for example , for elastic microcapsules @xcite , red blood cells @xcite , or vesicles moving in capillaries , deforming in shear flow @xcite , or sedimenting under gravity @xcite .",
    "another related system are droplets moving in a viscous fluid @xcite .    the analytical description and the simulation of soft elastic objects moving in a fluid are challenging problems as the hydrodynamics of the fluid is coupled to the elastic deformation of the capsule or vesicle @xcite .",
    "it is important to recognize that this coupling is mutual : on the one hand , hydrodynamic forces deform a soft capsule , a vesicle , or a droplet . on the other hand",
    ", the deformed capsule , vesicle , or droplet changes the boundary conditions for the fluid flow . as a result of this interplay ,",
    "the soft object deforms and takes on characteristic shapes ; eventually there are dynamical transitions between different shapes as a function of the driving force or flow velocity .",
    "such shape changes have important consequences for applications or biological function .    in the following ,",
    "we investigate the stationary shapes of sedimenting elastic capsules , which are moving in an otherwise quiescent incompressible fluid because of a homogeneous body force , which can be either the gravitational or centrifugal force .",
    "we focus on capsules on the microscale with radii @xmath0@xmath1 , a simple spherical rest shape , and sufficiently slow sedimenting velocities , such that the reynolds numbers are small and we can use stokes flow .",
    "we use the problem of sedimenting capsules to introduce a new iterative method to calculate efficiently axisymmetric stationary capsule shapes , which iterates between a boundary integral method to solve the stokes flow problem for given capsule shape @xcite and capsule shape equations to calculate the capsule shape in a given fluid velocity field .",
    "the method does not capture the dynamic evolution of the capsule shape but converges to its _ stationary _ shape .",
    "the method can be easily generalized to other types of driving forces apart from homogeneous body forces .",
    "we show results for a driving point force but , in principle , the method can also be applied to self - propelled capsules .",
    "the methods allows us to investigate instabilities and bifurcations of the final stationary capsule shape with high accuracy .",
    "elastic capsules have a closed elastic membrane , which is a two - dimensional solid that can support in - plane shear stresses and inhomogeneous stretching stresses with respect to its rest shape and has a bending rigidity .",
    "the theoretical concept of an elastic capsule is rather general such that chemistry and nature provide many examples .",
    "synthetic capsules , for example , with polymer gel interfaces , can be fabricated by various methods and with tunable mechanical properties and have numerous applications in encapsulation and delivery @xcite .",
    "there are also important biological examples of capsules , such as spherical ( icosahedral ) viruses , red blood cells , or artificial cells consisting of a lipid bilayer and a cortex from filamentous proteins such as actin @xcite , spectrin @xcite , amyloid fibrils @xcite , or mreb filaments @xcite . more generally , the cortex of all animal cells consisting of the plasma membrane and the underlying actin ( and spectrin ) filament network can be regarded as an elastic capsule .",
    "these types of capsules differ , however , in elastic properties .",
    "synthetic capsules from polymer gels typically have a spherical rest shape and sizes in the micrometer to millimeter range with a micrometer thick shell .",
    "their shell materials can be described by isotropic elasticity of thin shells @xcite .",
    "viruses are much smaller nanometer - sized objects but can also be described by thin shell isotropic elasticity @xcite .",
    "red blood cells acquire a nonspherical discoid rest shape under physiological conditions .",
    "their elasticity is no longer isotropic but the bilayer membrane dominates the bending rigidity , whereas the spectrin skeleton contributes a relatively small shear elasticity , while the bilayer membrane remains practically unstretchable @xcite . for artificial or biological cells with an actin cortex",
    "the elastic properties are governed by the filamentous network and strongly vary with the mesh size : at large mesh size , the bending modulus is relatively large , resembling red blood cell elasticity , at small mesh size the bending modulus becomes small compared to the stretching modulus resembling the situation for a thin isotropic elastic shell .",
    "sedimentation has already been studied for vesicles , both numerically @xcite and experimentally @xcite . as opposed to elastic capsules ,",
    "vesicles are bounded by a lipid bilayer , which is a two - dimensional fluid surface . for sedimenting vesicles , pearlike and egglike shapes",
    "have been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "numerically , depending on the initial configuration , pear shapes , banana shapes , or parachute shapes are found @xcite .",
    "the banana shape exhibits circulating surface flows @xcite . at sufficiently high velocities ,",
    "tethering instabilities occur both in experiments @xcite and simulations @xcite .",
    "sedimentation has also been studied for red blood cells , which constitute a special type of soft elastic capsule , which is unstretchable and has a nonspherical biconcave rest shape .",
    "for sedimenting red blood cells shape transitions also have been found .",
    "early experiments on centrifuged red blood cells @xcite show shapes developing tails during centrifugation . in ref .  , a sequence of shapes from the biconcave rest shape to cup - shaped and bag - shaped cells has been observed as a function of sedimenting time .",
    "extensive multiparticle collision dynamics ( mpcd ) simulations on sedimenting red blood cell models @xcite produced a dynamic shape diagram , which exhibits tear drop shapes , parachute ( or cup - shaped ) blood cells , and fin - tailed shapes .",
    "shape transitions of sedimenting spherical elastic capsules have not yet been studied although the spherical rest shape is prepared more easily in applications involving synthetic microcapsules .",
    "our iterative method allows us to completely characterize capsule shapes as a function of their elastic properties and the driving force .",
    "the shapes depend on two dimensionless parameters : ( i ) the fppl - von - krmn number describes the typical ratio of stretching to bending energy and characterizes the elastic properties of the capsule and ( ii ) the bond number describes the strength of the driving force relative to elastic deformation forces .",
    "we map out all stationary sedimenting shapes in a shape dynamic diagram parameter plane spanned by fppl - von - krmn and bond number .",
    "we can use this diagram to identify the accessible sedimenting shapes for different types of capsule elasticity , such as isotropic shells , red blood cell elasticity , or semiflexible polymer network elasticity .",
    "another important property of soft objects driven through a liquid is the relation between the driving force and the resulting velocity of the elastic objects . for",
    "strictly spherical sedimenting capsules this relation is the simple stokes law .",
    "shape transformations of a deformable sedimenting object should reflect in qualitative changes or even bifurcations in the force - velocity curves .",
    "this important aspect has only been poorly studied for droplets , vesicles , and red blood cells .",
    "some results have been obtained for quasispherical vesicles in ref .  .",
    "mpcd simulations for red blood cells showed no specific signs of shape transitions in the force - velocity relations @xcite , experimental measurements for vesicles @xcite are also not precise enough to find such features .",
    "we will calculate the force - velocity relation for sedimenting elastic capsules with high accuracy in this paper , such that we can address this issue and identify shape bifurcations of sedimenting spherical capsules by their force - velocity relation .",
    "there are many simulation methods which have been applied to the dynamics of vesicles or capsules in viscous fluids , such as particle - based hydrodynamic simulation techniques such as mpcd @xcite , dissipative particle dynamics @xcite , and lattice boltzmann simulations @xcite or boundary integral methods @xcite .",
    "these techniques simulate the full time - dependent dynamics using a triangulated representation of vesicles or capsules ; stationary states are obtained in the long - time limit . here",
    "we introduce an iterative boundary integral method coupled to shape equations for axisymmetric shapes , which directly converges to stationary shapes without simulation of the real dynamics .",
    "instead , we exploit axisymmetry to avoid triangulated representations and get an efficient iterative method based on boundary integrals for the fluid and shape equations for the capsule .",
    "we limit ourselves to axisymmetric capsule shapes resulting also in axisymmetric viscous fluid flows .",
    "then the elastic surface of the sedimenting capsule has to be at rest in its stationary shape without any surface flows .",
    "therefore , also the fluid inside the capsule will be at rest ( in the frame moving with the capsule ) .",
    "we will obtain the stationary capsule shape by solving a shape equation in curvilinear cylindrical coordinates and solve for the stokes flow of the surrounding fluid by applying a boundary integral method . in an iterative procedure",
    "we converge to the stationary shape , where the fluid forces onto the capsule and the boundary conditions for the fluid flow posed by the capsule shape are consistently incorporated .",
    "we perform this iterative procedure for a given driving gravitational ( or centrifugal ) force and obtain the corresponding capsule sedimenting velocity from the condition of force balance with the total fluid force onto the capsule surface .      , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "the shell is generated by revolution of the generatrix ( orange thin line ) that is calculated by the shape equations . ]",
    "we work in cylindrical coordinates to directly exploit the axisymmetry .",
    "the axis of symmetry is called @xmath4 , the distance to this axis @xmath2 , and the polar angle @xmath3 , see fig.[fig : schnitt ] .",
    "the shell is given by the generatrix @xmath5 $ ] which is parametrized in arc length @xmath6 ( starting at the lower apex with @xmath7 and ending at the upper apex with @xmath8 ) .",
    "the unit tangent vector @xmath9 to the generatrix at @xmath5 $ ] defines an angle @xmath10 via @xmath11 , which can be used to quantify the orientation of a patch of the capsule relative to the axis of symmetry .",
    "we want to calculate the flow field of a viscous incompressible fluid around an axisymmetric capsule of given fixed shape . for the calculation of the flow field the deformability of the capsule",
    "is not relevant , and the capsule can be viewed as a general immersed body of revolution @xmath12 . for the calculation of the capsule shape and the determination of its sedimenting velocity , we only need to calculate the surface forces onto the capsule which are generated by the fluid flow .    in the limit of small reynolds numbers the stress tensor @xmath13 in a stationary fluid on which no external body forces are exerted",
    "is given by the stationary stokes equation @xcite @xmath14 in cartesian coordinates , the stress tensor is given by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the hydrodynamic pressure , @xmath17 the viscosity , and @xmath18 is the rate of deformation tensor for a fluid velocity field @xmath19 .",
    "additionally , for an incompressible fluid , the continuity equation @xmath20 holds . from the stress tensor",
    "one can infer the surface force density @xmath21 onto the capsule by means of the local surface normal @xmath22 .    in the rest frame of the sedimenting axisymmetric capsule and with a `` no - slip '' condition at the capsule surface @xmath23",
    ", we are looking for axisymmetric solutions that have a given flow velocity @xmath24 at infinity and vanishing velocity on the capsule boundary . in the laboratory frame",
    ", @xmath25 is the sedimenting velocity of the capsule in the stationary state .",
    "therefore , @xmath24 has to be determined by balancing the total gravitational pulling force and the total hydrodynamic drag force on the capsule .    in the laboratory frame",
    "we are looking for solutions with vanishing pressure and velocity at infinity .",
    "the green s function for these boundary conditions is the well - known stokeslet ( also called oseen - burgers tensor ) , that is , the fluid velocity @xmath19 at @xmath26 due to a point - force @xmath27 acting on the fluid at @xmath28 , @xmath29 with the stokeslet @xmath30 whose elements are in cartesian coordinates ( @xmath31 ) @xmath32 this is the basis of the boundary integral approach for a solution of the stokes equation , where we want to find the correct distribution of point forces to match the `` no - slip '' condition on the capsule surface .",
    "because of the axisymmetry we can integrate over the polar angle and find the velocity due to a ring of point forces with a local force density @xmath33 acting on the fluid , @xmath34 , with a matrix @xmath35 , which can be calculated by integration of the stokeslet @xmath30 with respect to the polar angle . switching from forces @xmath33 acting on the fluid to forces @xmath36 acting on the capsule and integrating over all point forces on the surface , we find the general solution of the stokes equation for an axisymmetric point force distribution on the surface of the body of revolution @xmath12 , @xmath37 here greek indices denote the component in cylindrical coordinates , i.e. , @xmath38 ( @xmath39 for symmetry reasons ) . for these coordinates , the elements of the matrix kernel @xmath35 are given in appendix [ sec : appm ] according to ref .  .",

    "this results in the equation @xmath45 which can be used to determine the surface force distribution .    to numerically solve the integral for the surface force @xmath46 at a given set of points @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) we employ a simple collocation method , i.e.",
    ", we choose a discretized representation of the function @xmath49 and approximate the integral in ( [ eq : sol2 ] ) by the rectangle method .",

    "we validate our regularization in appendix [ app : perrin ] . for use in the shape equations",

    ", we use a convex combination @xmath135 of the two stresses and slowly increase the fraction @xmath136 of the new stress until it reaches unity .",
    "the iteration continues until the change ( monitored in pressure and velocity ) within one iteration cycle is sufficiently small . in total , this allows for a joint solution of the shape equations and the stokes equation to find the stationary shape and the sedimenting velocity at rather small numerical cost .    if there are multiple stationary solutions at a given gravitational strength ( see discussion of the shape diagram [ fig : vol ] in sec .",

    "we find an additional bifurcation into a pair of buckled shapes at small bending rigidities upon increasing the gravitational force .",
    "this bifurcation should be experimentally accessible with synthetic capsules in a centrifuge .",
    "the bifurcations are caused by hydrodynamic stretching , which increases a compressive hydrostatic pressure at the upper apex and leads to buckling - like transitions .",
    "all shape bifurcations can be resolved in the force - velocity relation of sedimenting capsules , where up to three capsule shapes with different velocities can occur for the same gravitational driving force , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] . in an experiment , these shapes are selected depending on the initial conditions .",
    "we also confirmed the stability of all axisymmetric shapes with respect to rotation around an axis perpendicular to the axis of symmetry , see fig.[fig : rotstab ] .",
    "we find more stationary buckled shapes if we consider sedimenting capsules where we vary the volume by changing the pressure as it is explained in more detail in appendix [ sec : pressure ] .",

    "for the sedimenting capsules this additional area is generated by hydrodynamic stretching .",
    "for vesicles , excess area can be `` hidden '' in thermal fluctuations . a spherical vesicle without such excess area can not undergo any shape transitions during sedimentation .",
    "the pear shape for elastic capsules at high bond numbers is similar to the `` tether '' formation by sedimenting vesicles @xcite .",
    "however , there are two important differences",
    ". first , the stretching energy of capsules penalizes deformations from the resting shape ( whereas vesicles have a liquid surface that allows any shape with the correct area ) , which leads to less extreme and pronounced tethers .",
    "moreover , cylindrical tethers are an actual equilibrium shape of a membrane under tension , which can coexist with a spherical vesicle @xcite .",
    "this is not the case for an elastic capsule .",
    "secondly , we do not find a bulge or `` droplet '' forming at the upper end , by which we mean an increase in the width of the extrusion near the end of the tether .",
    "this is rooted in the different bending energies : using a helfrich bending energy that is quadratic in the mean curvature @xmath242 , the negative meridional curvature ( @xmath243 ) needed to form a drop at the end of the tether is energetically favorable , whereas it is not with the hookean bending energy ( [ eq : hook ] ) we employ . moreover",
    ", elastic capsules can not develop shapes with circulating surface flows because of their solid membrane .",
    "therefore , there is no analog of the banana shape with surface flows that has been found in refs .   for vesicles .",
    "also sedimenting red blood cells exhibits different shapes ; in mpcd simulations transitions between tear drop shapes , parachute ( or cup - shaped ) blood cells and fin - tailed shapes @xcite have been found .",
    "red blood cells have a non - spherical discocyte rest shape , which already provides some excess area as compared to the minimal area of a sphere .",
    "therefore , stretching is not essential for dynamic shape transitions .",
    "the initial discocyte shape of red blood cells also gives rise to a strong tendency to tilt , which is absent for our initially spherical capsules .",
    "the parachute shape also tilts by almost @xmath244 during transformation into a tear drop @xcite .",
    "interestingly , all transitions observed in ref .   did not show any signatures in the force - velocity relation or the bending or shear energies .",
    "for spherical capsules we find clear signatures of all transitions in the force - velocity relation in fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] .",
    "it remains to be clarified in future work whether the mpcd technique is not accurate enough or exhibits too many fluctuations to resolve these signatures or whether the dynamic transitions of sedimenting red blood cells qualitatively differ , for example , because tilt plays such a prominent role .    finally , we studied capsules driven by localized forces , such as a pushing or pulling point - like force . for such localized driving forces",

    "the first integral is related to the global axial force balance of the capsule , which can be seen by considering @xmath8 , where the @xmath273 gives @xmath274 .",
    "the quantity @xmath266 contains the contribution to the net force in the @xmath4 direction and thus a shape with the desired features ( namely @xmath275 at the apexes ) must have @xmath274 and , thus , be in global force balance in axial direction .",
    "we want to study the change in the torque due to an infinitesimally small rotation @xmath276 of the velocity and the gravitational force vector .",
    "geometrically , this is equivalent to rotating the capsule . a change of the velocity boundary condition @xmath277 leads to new hydrodynamic surface forces @xmath278 .",
    "as we did not change the capsule we can employ the reciprocal theorem @xmath279 and find @xmath280 .",
    "the new hydrodynamic torque is , thus , @xmath281 we limit ourselves to a linear analysis , that is , we perform an infinitesimal rotation around the @xmath282 axis by an angle @xmath283 , i.e. , @xmath284 . here",
    "@xmath285 is the unit matrix ( @xmath286 ) and @xmath287 generates a rotation around the @xmath282 axis with @xmath288 .",
    "then , to linear order in @xmath283 , @xmath289 here @xmath191 gives the pivot point of the rotation .",
    "since we know that the centers of mass and hydrodynamic stress have to lie on the symmetry axis , studying rotations about points on this axis suffices .",
    "likewise , we can calculate the gravitational contribution to the new torque , which is ( again to linear order in @xmath283 ) @xmath290 equating these two gives the pivot point of the marginally stable infinitesimal rotation , i.e. , the center of hydrodynamic stress .",
    "this argument does not account for a change of the capsule shape due to the altered stresses upon rotation , which means that a seemingly unstable capsule might be stabilized axially by a `` wobbling '' deformation leading to different hydrodynamic torques . in principle",
    ", this might also work the other way round ( as for semiflexible cylindrical rods @xcite ) , but we think it is less relevant here , because of the typically large radius of curvature at the lower apex .",

    "it is helpful to not use @xmath95 but the pressure at the center of mass , @xmath296 , as an actual control parameter because we use a coordinate system that fixes @xmath297 at the lower apex of the capsule .",
    "the possibility to explore a range of volumes allows for a greater variety of shapes . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pc ] , we show the pressure - volume relation for stationary axisymmetric shapes with a velocity close to @xmath298 ( which determines for each shape a certain gravity @xmath145 ) .",
    "solutions at lower velocities are typically easier to find , but very low velocities are rather atypical because one ultimately sees the variety of static solutions @xcite .",
    "each type of stable shape gives one pressure - volume branch in fig .",
    "[ fig : pc ] .",
    "apart from pseudospherical , pear - shaped and the pair of weakly and strongly buckled solutions , we find additional branches , which correspond to higher - order buckled shapes with three , four , or five indentations .    as for fixed volume , the main contribution to the shape is due to static pressure ( differences ) . for the pseudospherical branch",
    "this can be seen by comparing the volume ( in reduced units ) with the known pressure - volume relation for a spherical capsule in the static ( @xmath294 ) case @xmath299 which fits our data rather well .",
    "the higher - order buckled shapes occur at small volumes or small effective pressure @xmath300 .",
    "we expect to find corresponding higher - order buckled shapes also under volume control if we prescribe a corresponding small volume @xmath301 .",
    "but also for higher prescribed volumes such as @xmath302 , these shapes could become stable at very high @xmath145 : higher volumes require a larger pressure @xmath300 and , thus , also higher deformation forces to induce buckling .",
    "such higher deformation forces can be achieved at high @xmath145 .     of the sedimenting elastic capsule as a function of the controlled pressure @xmath303 at the center of mass at fixed bending rigidity @xmath162 and for shapes moving at a velocity @xmath304 .",
