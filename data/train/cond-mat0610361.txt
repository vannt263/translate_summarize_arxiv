    "the hall coefficient @xmath0 is generally a useful tool to characterize metals and semiconductors , for it reflects the band structure and the sign of charge carriers . in strongly - correlated electron materials",
    ", @xmath0 often shows complex dependences on temperature and other control parameters , which are expected to give a clue to understanding the underlying unconventional electronic states ; in this context , @xmath0 has been used for the studies of such novel phenomena as quantum phase transition @xcite or charge - stripe formation .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , quantitative understandings of @xmath0 in strongly - correlated electron materials have been difficult to achieve , and high-@xmath10 cuprate superconductors are no exception .",
    "@xcite in fact , since the optimally - doped cuprates are just in the middle of the strong- and weak - coupling limits , @xcite even the basic framework for the description of its electronic state is still controversial ; as a result , most of the normal - state transport properties , including the hall coefficient , are generally believed to be too complicated to be quantitatively understood , though there have been attempts to explain their fundamental behavior in frameworks of specific theories .",
    "@xcite    in this regard , however , the @xmath0 of high-@xmath10 cuprates appears to be rather peculiar , because in the lightly hole - doped regime where the low - energy physics is apparently governed by the  fermi arc \" ( a small portion of the large fermi surface expected in the absence of electron correlations),@xcite we have recently found @xcite that @xmath0 simply behaves like the  hall constant \" of a conventional metal and the electron correlation effects seem to be implemented only through modifications of the fermi surface in determining @xmath0 .",
    "this finding in cuprates suggests that @xmath0 might give us a unique opportunity to find a clue to building a proper framework for the description of the electronic state of cuprates despite the strong electron correlations .",
    "it should be emphasized that there is still no proper theoretical understanding for _ how _ the correlation gap is suppressed ( and eventually closed ) when carriers are doped to a mott insulator , so any new information regarding the band structure of doped mott insulators ( to which cuprates belong ) would be of fundamental importance for addressing the strong electron correlation problem .",
    "the la@xmath5sr@xmath6cuo@xmath2 system @xcite we study here is a prototypical cuprate , where @xmath8 = 0 is a parent charge - transfer ( ct ) insulator @xcite with the band gap @xmath11 called the ct gap .",
    "we also study another parent ct insulator pr@xmath3la@xmath4cuo@xmath2 ( plco ) for comparison . in our previous work , @xcite besides showing that @xmath0 of lsco at low doping can be interpreted as a  hall constant \" below 300 k , we reported that a marked decrease sets in at higher temperature , which was proposed to be possibly due to the contribution of thermally - created holes . in the present work , in an effort to quantitatively understand the temperature dependence and the doping evolution of @xmath0 in lsco and to elucidate the electronic structure of this system , we have extended the high - temperature measurements of @xmath9 to a wide doping range , starting from @xmath8 = 0 . as a result , we find that the behavior of @xmath9 at @xmath8 = 0 is surprisingly simple to understand , despite the strong electron correlations that open the mott gap in the first place ; furthermore , our data in the lightly - doped region are found to give a solid basis for understanding the high - temperature behavior in terms of the thermal activation of charge carriers over a well - defined gap . at higher doping ,",
    "the behavior of @xmath9 becomes less unambiguous to understand , and in this paper we present our attempt to describe its behavior in terms of a phenomenological two - carrier model .",
    "the la@xmath5sr@xmath6cuo@xmath2 and pr@xmath3la@xmath4cuo@xmath2 single crystals are grown by the traveling - solvent floating - zone method .",
    "the lsco crystals are annealed to tune the oxygen content to 4.000@xmath120.001 as described in refs . and .",
    "in particular , the oxygen stoichiometry of the @xmath8 = 0 samples ( which are annealed in flowing ar at 800@xmath13 ) is confirmed by both the thermo - gravimetry analysis and the magnetic susceptibility , which shows a very sharp nel transition at 321 k. the @xmath8 values shown here are determined by the inductively - coupled - plasma atomic - emission - spectroscopy analysis .",
    "the plco crystals are annealed in flowing o@xmath1 at 700@xmath13 to minimize oxygen deficiency . to measure @xmath0 at temperatures up to 1000 k",
    ", we use a 6-t superconducting magnet system with a room - temperature bore , in which a water - cooled furnace is fit .",
    "samples are kept under suitable atmospheres during the experiments to ensure that the oxygen content does not change . for the measurements of @xmath0 using a standard six - probe technique , we record the full magnetic - field dependence of the hall voltage at a fixed temperature by sweeping the magnetic field to both plus and minus polarities , subtract the asymmetric part coming from contact misalignment , and fit the symmetrical part with a straight line to determine @xmath0 , which is essential for the high accuracy achieved in the present work .",
    "because the present work involves transport measurements in temperatures up to 1000 k which is much higher than usual , it would be prudent to discuss the possibility that the high - temperature hall data might be adversely affected by the oxygen mobility within a sample or by some change in the oxygen content : as for the oxygen mobility at high temperature , this can in principle provide a parallel channel for charge transport ; such an effect is actually important in a mixed ionic and electronic conductors such as gdbamn@xmath1o@xmath14 which was recently found to have a very high oxygen mobility,@xcite but in lsco the oxygen - ion conductivity at 1000 k is negligible compared to the electron conductivity . of more concern",
    "might be that the moving oxygen could affect the electron transport in an unexpected way ; however , this is very unlikely to be the case in lsco , because the oxygen diffusion time at 1000 k is of the order of 10@xmath15 s , while the electron scattering time is of the order of 10@xmath16 s at best , so the electrons only see static oxygen environment during the transport events . regarding the oxygen content issue",
    ", it should be emphasized that in the present experiment the atmosphere in the furnace is optimized for different doping ranges to minimize the change in the oxygen content in the samples during the measurements .",
    "for example , in the lightly - doped region of lsco one should only worry about excess oxygen , so the measurements are done in pure argon ; on the other hand , in the optimally- to overdoped region one should worry about oxygen vacancies rather than excess oxygen , so the measurements are done in 1 atm of oxygen .",
    "( since we can not avoid noticeable oxygen loss at high temperature for @xmath17 0.20 , we show data only up to 700 k for @xmath8 = 0.21 in this work . )",
    "since the oxygen phase diagram is known for the whole range of sr doping for lsco,@xcite we can be sure that the possible change in the effective hole doping is less than 1% during the measurements up to 1000 k under our measurement conditions .",
    "indeed , the resistivity data monitored upon thermal cycling ( warming to 1000 k and cooling to room temperature ) are always confirmed to be essentially identical .",
    "up to 1000 k measured on a series of high - quality lsco single crystals.,width=321 ]    figure 1 shows the @xmath9 data of lsco single crystals up to 1000 k for the whole doping range studied .",
    "those data are essentially consistent with the previously - reported high - temperature data measured on polycrystalline samples,@xcite but bear much higher accuracies .",
    "note that there has been no high - temperature data for @xmath8 = 0  0.03 even for polycrystalline samples , and it turns out that the data from this insulating regime provide important insights for analyzing the data for higher dopings . in the following ,",
    "we describe our analyses of the data , starting from the parent insulator , @xmath8 = 0 .",
    "interestingly , the temperature dependence of @xmath0 is found to be most unambiguously understood in the parent ct insulator la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 , where the electron correlation effects are the strongest ; fig .",
    "2(a ) shows the @xmath9 data up to 1000 k together with the fitting to the formula , @xmath18 it is clear in fig .",
    "2(a ) that this fitting is essentially perfect , which means that @xmath9 at @xmath8 = 0 is simply governed by two gaps ( @xmath19 is the electron charge and @xmath20 is the unit volume per cu ) .",
    "the lower - temperature part of the data tells us that there is a small concentration ( @xmath21 = 0.57% ) of impurity states located at @xmath22 = 0.087 ev above the top of the valence band ; such a situation has been already known @xcite for la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 , where @xmath22 determines the impurity - ionization energy.@xcite what is new here is that at high temperature above @xmath23500 k another activation process with @xmath11 = 0.89 ev involving a large density of states becomes active , which obviously corresponds to the activation across the ct gap . a schematic energy diagram is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "the fact that @xmath0 is positive at high temperature means that the holes in the valence band are more mobile than the electrons in the conduction band ; indeed , if one remembers @xcite that the valence band in cuprates is primarily of o 2p character ( implying a wide band ) , while the conduction band is essentially a cu 3d band ( which is always narrow @xcite ) , it is reasonable for the holes to have higher mobility and become dominant .",
    "our fitting yields the prefactor of the high - temperature excitation term , @xmath24 , of as large as 4.3 hole / cu ; although this exceeds the logical limit of 1 hole / cu , this is actually reasonable because the contribution of the electrons ( that are created with holes ) tends to reduce the @xmath0 value and lead to an increase @xcite in the effective @xmath24.@xcite in any case , @xmath24 being larger than 1 hole / cu strongly suggests that we are observing excitations across major bands .     of la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 measured up to 1000",

    "the sign of @xmath0 is negative below 700 k , which indicates that the impurity states ( that are presumably due to some oxygen nonstoichiometry ) lie close to the conduction band and provides electron carriers at moderate temperature .",
    "however , @xmath0 of plco shows a sign change above 700 k , corroborating the conclusion obtained for la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 that at high temperature the activation across the ct gap becomes relevant and the hole carriers govern @xmath0 due to their higher mobility .",
    "we note that our @xmath11 obtained for la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 gives the thermodynamically measured ct gap , and this is to be compared with the optically measured ct gap , @xcite which is usually believed to be about 2 ev . here , a little caution is needed , because it is customary to take the _",
    "peak energy _ of the optical absorption as a measure of the ct gap , but this energy does _ not _ correspond to the true gap that is best measured as the minimum excitation energy between the two bands and is equal to the distance between the two band edges . when we take the _ onset _ of the optical absorption as a measure of the ct gap , the existing optical data @xcite give values of 0.9  1.3 ev , which is still a bit larger than our thermodynamic value of 0.89 ev .",
    "an obvious reason for this difference is that the ct gap is an indirect one , @xcite but additionally our @xmath11 is measured at high temperature , where the weakening of the antiferromagnetic correlations and the band broadening would also reduce @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , polaron effects are likely to be important in insulating cuprates,@xcite and these effects would naturally reduce the gap at high temperature.@xcite hence , one may conclude that the ct gap manifested in the hall effect at @xmath8 = 0 is fully consistent with the optics data .",

( 2 ) gives a reasonable account of the essential feature of the data ( except for the anderson localization ) , and hence one may conclude that the thermal activation of holes gives rise to the exponential decrease in @xmath0 at high temperature not only at @xmath8 = 0 but also at low doping .",
    "this in turn indicates that there are strong charge fluctuations in lightly - doped cuprates at @xmath32400 k , where the charge transport must become incoherent ; therefore , it is probably not reasonable to describe @xmath0 in this regime using theories developed for a metallic system ( i.e. , for coherent electrons with well - defined wave vectors ) , such as that in ref . .",

    ". probably , there are two possibilities to interpret this result .",
    "one is to take the reduction in @xmath11 to be a result of the softening of the main ct gap upon slight doping ; in this case , the same bands are involved in the activation process after the doping , and our observation that @xmath24 is essentially doping independent is in good accord .",
    "considering the fact that doping to a mott insulator necessarily involves a change in the electronic structure at a high energy scale of the order of the on - site repulsion @xmath33 ( because doping one hole to a mott insulator not only creates a hole state but also removes one state from the upper hubbard band),@xcite it would be possible that a slight doping induces a relatively large change in the band structure .",
    "the other possibility is that the so - called  in - gap states \" @xcite are created in the middle of the original ct gap upon hole doping and our @xmath11 actually measures the charge - transfer excitations from these new states to the upper hubbard band ( conduction band ) . in this case",
    ", one would expect @xmath24 for @xmath34 0.01 to be much smaller than that for @xmath8 = 0 ; however , a large @xmath24 might be possible for some particular shape of the band edge,@xcite so our result in fig .",
    "3(b ) can not conclusively exclude this possibility . in any case , the true nature of @xmath11 in the doped system is best left as an open question , and its identification is actually at the heart of understanding what really happens upon doping to a mott insulator .",
    "it is intriguing to note that our @xmath11 for the lightly - doped region coincides rather well with the peak frequency of the mid - infrared ( mir ) absorption seen in the optical conductivity of lsco,@xcite so the mir absorption may also have something to do with the ct excitations",

    "@xcite motivated by this qualitative observation , we attempt to understand the high - temperature @xmath9 behavior for @xmath34 0.08 in terms of a crude phenomenological two - carrier model , remembering that the occurrence of an electronic heterogeneity ( microscopic phase separation or coexistence of different types of carriers ) has been discussed repeatedly for lsco ; @xcite for example , doping evolutions of the magnetic susceptibility @xcite or the superfluid density @xcite have been discussed to reflect an electronic heterogeneity . in the following analysis",

    "the high - temperature @xmath9 behavior is found to be qualitatively the same but is weakened , which we try to describe with a phenomenological two - carrier model that considers the thermal activation for one of the two components . besides giving a perspective to consistently understand the high - temperature behavior of @xmath0 and @xmath51 , our model allows us to understand the @xmath0 value both at high temperature and at 0 k for a wide range of doping , despite its crudeness .",
    "overall , our data and analysis strongly suggest that charge fluctuations associated with a sub - ev gap should be taken into account when discussing the physics of cuprates even at relatively low energy scales .",
    "implications of this conclusion include : ( 1 ) breakdown of the @xmath53 law of @xmath55 at high temperature may be related to the onset of incoherence in one of the two species of the carriers , that dominates the hall effect but little influences the resistivity near optimum doping ; ( 2 )  opening of the large pseudogap \" may actually be a  freezing of charge fluctuations \" associated with the fermi arc .",
    "we greatly thank l. p. gorkov and g. b. teitelbaum for illuminating discussions and pointing out an activated behavior in our data .",
    "we also thank e. abrahams , b. batlogg , t. h. geballe , j. fink , s. a. kivelson , p. b. littlewood , n. p. ong , d. pines , g. a. sawatzky , x. f. sun , a. a. taskin , t. tohyama , i. tsukada , and s. uchida for helpful discussions .",
    "this work was supported by grant - in - aid for science from jsps .",
    "the binding energy of the holes to the oxygen acceptor mentioned in ref . is the activation energy obtained from the arrhenius plot , which corresponds to 1/2 of @xmath22 defined in eq .",
    "( this is because the chemical potential moves to the middle of the gap when the thermal activation process becomes dominant ) .",
    "hence , our result of @xmath22 = 87 mev is essentially consistent with ref . where the binding energy was mentioned to be 35 mev .",
    "remember that in an intrinsic semiconductor the hall coefficient is given by @xmath58 $ ] , where @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) is the mobility of holes ( electrons ) and @xmath61 is the number of pair - created electrons and holes .",
    "hence , the effective density of states is always enhanced by the factor @xmath62 .        in lightly sr - doped samples ,",
    "the impurity states of the order of 0.5% estimated for @xmath8 = 0 are probably still present , but they provide only a small amount of mobile holes at moderate temperature ( e.g. , 0.1% at 300 k ) because @xmath22 = 87 mev = 1010 k ; hence , the impurity term can be safely neglected in eq .",
    "( 2 ) in comparison with @xmath8 .    in those fittings , @xmath8 was actually treated as a fitting parameter , because there is an uncertainty of up to 10% in the compositional @xmath8 values in lightly - doped samples .",
    "the resulting @xmath8 values obtained from the fits are 0.0098 , 0.0213 , 0.0369 , 0.0440 , and 0.0546 for the five sets of data , all in reasonable agreement with the compositional values .      in conventional semiconductor physics",
    ", @xmath24 is actually a temperature - dependent effective density of states that is viewed to be concentrated at the band edge , and its value is determined largely by the shape of the actual density of states near the edge .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath24 ( which , for example , is @xmath63 in the case of a parabolic band in a 3d system ) is often neglected because it is much weaker than the exponential term .",
    "we note that recently gorkov and teitelbaum have tried to fit the high - temperature @xmath9 data for the whole doping range by simply using eq .",
    "( 2 ) with the first term replaced by @xmath64 ; l. p. gorkov and g. b. teitelbaum , cond - mat/0607010 .                        in our fitting procedure ,",
    "the parameters are determined so that the widest range of the high - temperature data are fitted to the exponential behavior .",
    "hence , the temperature below which the fitting fails and the the plateau value of our fit come out naturally without any subjective choice in the procedure ."
