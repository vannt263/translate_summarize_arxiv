    "one of the most common phrases of wisdom in polymer physics is that a polymer , in its terminal relaxation time @xmath2 , displaces itself by its own size in physical space @xcite .",
    "being constructed from monomers connected in series , a polymer has a wide range of length - scale dependent relaxation times .",
    "the longest one of them is the terminal relaxation time @xmath2 , manifested in the decay of the polymer s end - to - end vector correlation function .",
    "[ e.g. , for a phantom rouse polymer of length @xmath3 , the relaxation time corresponding to length scale @xmath4 scales @xmath5 with @xmath6 a positive integer , implying that @xmath7 for a phantom rouse polymer ] @xcite .",
    "the terminal relaxation time @xmath2 of a polymer scales with its length as a power - law @xmath8 for some exponent @xmath9 , while its own size in space scales as @xmath10 for some exponent @xmath11 .",
    "if the polymer is to displace itself by its own size in time @xmath2 , in simplest of cases the mean - square displacement of a tagged monomer of a polymer must behave @xmath12 , and since the quantity @xmath13 is not necessarily unity , the dynamics of a tagged monomer in a polymer must be anomalous till the terminal relaxation time .",
    "if asked to provide canonical examples of such anomalous behavior , a polymer physicist would almost certainly cite single polymer dynamics , such as phantom rouse ( @xmath14 ) , self - avoiding rouse [ @xmath15 in three dimensions ( 3d ) , @xmath16 in two dimensions ( 2d ) and @xmath17 and self - avoiding zimm ( @xmath15 in 3d , @xmath18 in 2d and @xmath19 ) polymers .",
    "( the correct single polymer dynamics in a fluid was first presented by zimm @xcite . in this paper",

    "an extension of the standard fokker - planck equation , anomalous dynamics is a consequence of introducing power - law waiting times before each jump of the concerned particle , as the jump length and the waiting times for any jump is obtained from fixed probability distributions , independently of their values at previous jumps .",

    "further , in any spatial dimension , the curvilinear conformation of a reptating polymer can be described by a string of 0s and 1s , corresponding to whether two consecutive monomers reside within the same cell or not  this forms the `` curvilinear co - ordinate '' description of the polymer .",
