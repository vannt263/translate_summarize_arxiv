    "short - period exoplanets are expected to have atmospheric compositions and dynamics that differ significantly from solar system giant planets  au , regardless of its actual period , and regardless of mass , which may range from neptune - sized to brown dwarf .",
    "they are all class iv and v extrasolar giant planets in the scheme of @xcite . ] .",
    "these planets orbit @xmath11 closer to their host stars than jupiter does from the sun . as a result , they receive @xmath12 more flux and experience tidal forces @xmath13 stronger than jupiter .",
    "in contrast to jupiter , which releases roughly as much power in its interior as it receives from the sun , short - period exoplanets have power budgets dictated by the flux they receive from their host stars .",
    "roughly speaking , the stellar flux incident on a planet does one of two things : it is reflected back into space , or advected elsewhere on the planet and re - radiated at different wavelengths .",
    "the physical parameters that describe these processes are the planet s bond albedo and redistribution efficiency .",
    "giant planets in the solar system have albedos greater than 50% because of the presence of condensed molecules ( h@xmath14o , ch@xmath15 , nh@xmath16 , etc . ) in their atmospheres .",
    "planets with effective temperatures exceeding @xmath17400  k should be cloud free , leading to albedos of 0.050.4 @xcite . if pressure - broadened na and k opacity is important at optical wavelengths ( as it is for brown dwarfs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then the bond albedos of hot jupiters may be less than 10% @xcite .",
    "but the very hottest planets , the so - called class v extrasolar giant planets ( @xmath18  k ) , might have very high albedos due to a high silicate cloud layer @xcite . for a planet",
    "whose albedo is dominated by clouds ( as opposed to rayleigh scattering ) the albedo depends on the composition and size of cloud particles @xcite .",
    "early attempts to observe reflected light from exoplanets @xcite indicated that they might not be as reflective as solar system gas giants ( for a review , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "measurements of hd  209458b taken with the canadian most satellite revealed a very low albedo ( @xmath19% , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it has since been taken for granted that all short - period planets have albedos on par with that of charcoal .    from the standpoint of the planet",
    "s climate , the important factor is not the albedo at any one wavelength , @xmath20 , but rather the integrated albedo , weighted by the incident stellar spectrum , known as the bond albedo and denoted in this paper as @xmath5 . the relation between @xmath20 and the planet s bond albedo is not trivial .",
    "if the albedo is dominated by gray clouds , then the albedo at a single wavelength can indeed be extrapolated to obtain @xmath5 . for non - gray reflectance spectra , however , it is critical to measure @xmath20 at the peak emitting wavelength of the host star to obtain a good estimate of the planet s energy budget .",
    "for example , as pointed out in @xcite , planets with identical albedo spectra , @xmath20 , may have radically different @xmath5 depending on the spectral type of their host stars .",
    "the first few measurements of hot jupiter phase variations showed signs that these planets are not all cut from the same cloth . @xcite and @xcite quoted very different phase function amplitudes for the @xmath21  andromeda and hd  189733 systems .",
    "it was not clear whether the differences were intrinsic to the planets , however , because the data were taken with different instruments , at different wavelengths , and with very different observation schemes ( in any case , subsequent re - analysis of the original data and newly aquired _",
    "observations of @xmath21  andromeda  b paint a completely different picture of that system : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the uniform study presented in @xcite , on the other hand , showed that hd  179949b and hd  209458b exhibit significantly different degrees of heat recirculation , confirming suspicions .",
    "but it was not clear whether hot exoplanets were uni - modal or bi - modal in redistribution : are hd  179949b and hd  209458b end - members of a single distribution , or prototypes for two fundamentally different sorts of exoplanets ?    the presence or lack of a stratospheric temperature inversion @xcite on the day - sides of exoplanets has been invoked to explain a purported bi - modality in recirculation efficiency on hot jupiters @xcite .",
    "the argument , simply put , is that optical absorbers high in the atmosphere of extremely hot jupiters ( equilibrium temperatures greater than @xmath22  k ) would absorb incident photons where the radiative timescales are short , making it difficult for these planets to recirculate energy . the most robust detection of this temperature inversion is for hd  209458b @xcite , but this planet does not exhibit a large day - night brightness contrast at 8  @xmath23 m @xcite .",
    "so while temperature inversions seem to exist in the majority of hot jupiter atmospheres @xcite , their connection to circulation efficiency if any is not clear .",
    "it has been suggested ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that observations of secondary eclipses and phase variations each constrain a combination of a planet s bond albedo and circulation efficiency .",
    "but observations even phase variations at a single waveband do little to constrain a planet s energy budget . in this work",
    "we show how observations in different wavebands and for different planets can be meaningfully combined to estimate these planetary parameters .    in ",
    "2 we introduce a simple model to quantify the day - side and night - side energy budget of a short - period planet , and show how a planet s bond albedo , @xmath5 , and redistribution efficiency , @xmath6 , can be constrained by observations . in ",
    "3 we use published observations of 24 transiting planets to estimate day - side and where appropriate night - side effective temperatures .",
    "we construct a two - dimensional distribution function in @xmath5 and @xmath6 in   4 .",
    "we state our conclusions in   5 .",
    "short - period planets have a power budget entirely dictated by the flux they receive from their host star , which dwarfs tidal heating or remnant heat of formation .",
    "following @xcite , we define the equilibrium temperature at the planet s sub - stellar point : @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the star s effective temperature and radius , and @xmath27 is the planet  star distance ( for a circular orbit @xmath28 is simply equal to the semi - major axis , @xmath29 ) . for shorthand , we define the geometrical factor @xmath30 , which is directly constrained by transit lightcurves @xcite",
    ".    the incident flux on the planet is given by @xmath31 , and it is significant that this quantity has some associated uncertainty . for a planet on a circular orbit ,",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath32 is related to first order to the uncertainties in the host star s effective temperature , and the geometrical factor : @xmath33    for a planet with non - zero eccentricity , @xmath2 varies with time , but we are only concerned with its value at superior conjunction : secondary eclipse occurs at superior conjunction , when we are seeing the planet s day - side . at that point in the orbit , the planet  star distance is @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the planet s orbital eccentricity and argument of periastron , respectively .    for planets with non - zero eccentricity ,",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath2 is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the observational uncertainties in the two components of the planet s eccentricity and @xmath40 , because the eccentricity and argument of periastron are highly correlated in orbital fits .",
    "that said , the uncertainties @xmath38 and @xmath39 are often not included in the literature , in which case we use a slightly different and more conservative formulation of the error budget using @xmath41 and @xmath40 . ] .      at secondary eclipse , and in the absence of albedo or energy circulation ,",
    "the equilibrium temperature of a region on the planet depends on the normalized projected distance , @xmath42 , from the center of the planetary disc as @xmath43 . the thermal secondary eclipse depth in this limit",
    "is given by : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the brightness temperature of the star at wavelength @xmath46 .",
    "in the no - circulation limit , then , the day - side emergent spectrum is not exactly that of a blackbody , even if each annulus has a blackbody spectrum . but these differences are not important for the present study , since we are concerned with bolometric flux . by integrating equation",
    "[ equilibrium_sed ] over @xmath46 , one obtains the effective temperature of the day - side in the no - albedo , no - circulation limit : @xmath47 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , treating the planet s day - side as a uniform hemisphere emitting at this temperature gives nearly the same wavelength dependence as the more complex equation  [ equilibrium_sed ] .",
    "the @xmath48 temperatures for our sample of 24 transiting planets are shown in table  1 .",
    "these set the maximum possible day - side effective temperature we should expect to measure .    the integrated day - side flux in the general non - zero circulation case is more subtle : heat may be transported to the planet s night - side , and/or to its poles . in this paper",
    "we neglect the e - w asymetry in the planet s temperature map due to zonal flows and hence phase offsets in the thermal phase variations . under this assumption",
    ", the day - night temperature contrast can more directly be extracted from the observed thermal phase variations .    in practice , many studies have adopted a single parameter to represent _ both _ zonal and meridional transport .",
    "it is instructive to consider the apparent day - side effective temperatures in various limits : uniform day - side temperature and @xmath49 on the night - side ( this is often referred to as the planet s `` equilibrium temperature '' ) : @xmath50 ; in the case of perfect longitudinal transport but no latitudinal transport : @xmath51 ; and in the limit of a uniform temperature everywhere on the planet : @xmath52 .",
    "comparing the apparent day - side temperatures in the three limits of circulation above leads to the following simple parametrization of the day - side effective temperature in terms of the planetary albedo , @xmath5 , and circulation efficiency , @xmath6 : @xmath53 where @xmath1 .",
    "note that @xmath6 is related to but different from the @xmath54 used in @xcite .",
    "the former is merely a parametrization of the observed disk - integrated effective temperature , while the latter , which can take values from 0 to @xmath55 , is a precisely defined ratio of radiative and advective timescales .",
    "the @xmath56 case is precisely equal to the @xmath57 case , while the @xmath58 limit is equivalent to @xmath59 .",
    "our definition of @xmath6 is similar to the @xcite definition of @xmath60 and yields the same no - circulation limit .",
    "but our @xmath61 limit produces a lower day - side brightness than the @xmath62 limit , because we assume that the planet s day - side has a uniform temperature distribution in that limit ( for a discussion of different redistribution parameterizations , see the appendix of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in reality ,",
    "efficient longitudinal transport ( read : fast zonal winds ) may lead to more banding and therefore less efficient latitudinal transport .",
    "so one could argue that in the limit of perfect day - night temperature homogenization , both the day and night apparent temperatures should be @xmath63 , in between the burrows et al .",
    "value of @xmath64 and that suggested by our parameterization , @xmath65 . at moderate day - night recirculation efficiencies , however , there is a good deal of latitudinal transport ( i. dobbs - dixon , priv .",
    "comm . ) , so implicitly assuming a constant @xmath66 latitudinal dependence as done by burrows et al. is not founded , either .",
    "the bottom line is that any single - parameter implementation of advection is incapable of capturing the real complexities involved , but longitudinal transport is the dominant factor in determining day and night effective temperatures .",
    "not withstanding the subtleties discussed above and noting that cooling tends to latitudinaly homogenize night - side temperatures @xcite , we get a night - side temperature of : @xmath67 note that @xmath4 and @xmath68 are the equator - weighted temperatures of their respective hemispheres ( ie , as seen by an edge - on viewer ) . as such",
    ", they will tend to be slightly higher than the hemisphere - averaged temperature , except in the @xmath61 limit .",
    "this is also why the quantity @xmath69 is still a weak function of @xmath6 .     and circulation efficiency , @xmath6 , differently .",
    "a measurement of the secondary eclipse depth at optical wavelengths is a measure of albedo ( solid line ) .",
    "a secondary eclipse depth at thermal wavelengths gives a joint constraint on albedo and recirculation ( dotted line ) .",
    "a measurement of the night - side effective temperature from thermal phase variations yields a constraint ( the dashed line ) nearly orthogonal to the day - side measurement.,width=317 ]    in figure  [ example_exclusion ] we show how different kinds of observations constrain @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "for this example , we chose constraints consistent with @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the solid line is a locus of constant @xmath5 ; the dotted line is the locus of constant @xmath72 ; the dashed line is a locus of constant @xmath73 . from this figure",
    "it is clear that the measurements complement each other : measuring two of the three quantities ( bond albedo , effective day - side or night - side temperatures ) uniquely determines the planet s albedo and circulation efficiency .",
    "when observations have some associated uncertainty , they define a swath through the @xmath5@xmath6 plane .",
    "we begin by considering all the photometric observations of short - period exoplanets published through november 2010 , summarized in table  [ observations ] .",
    "we have discarded photometric observations of non - transiting planets because of their unknown radius and orbital inclination - bootis  b , @xmath21-andromeda  b , 51  peg  b , gl  876d , hd  75289b , hd  179949b and hd  46375b @xcite ] .",
    "this leaves us with 24 transiting exoplanets for which there are observations in at least one waveband at superior conjunction , and in some cases in multiple wavebands and at multiple planetary phases .",
    "stellar and planetary data are taken from the exoplanet encyclopedia ( exoplanet.eu ) , and references therein .",
    "we repeated parts of the analysis with the exoplanet data explorer database ( exoplanets.org ) and found identical results , within the uncertainties .",
    "when the stellar data are not available , we have assumed typical parameters for the appropriate spectral class , and solar metallicity .",
    "insofar as we are only concerned with the broadband brightnesses of the stars , our results should not depend sensitively on the input stellar parameters .",
    "knowing the stars @xmath25 , @xmath74 and [ fe / h ] , we use the phoenix / nextgen stellar spectrum grids @xcite to determine their brightness temperatures at the observed bandpasses . at each waveband for which eclipse or phase observations have been obtained ,",
    "we determine the ratio of the stellar flux to the blackbody flux at that grid star s @xmath25 .",
    "we then apply this factor to the @xmath25 of the observed star .",
    "it is worth noting that the choice of stellar model leads to systematic uncertainties in the planetary brightness that are of order the photometric uncertainties .",
    "for example , @xcite use stellar models for hat - p-7 from @xcite , while we use those of @xcite .",
    "the resulting 8  @xmath23 m brightness temperatures for hat - p-7b differ by as much as 600  k , or slightly more than @xmath8 .",
    "our uniform use of @xcite models should alleviate this problem , however .      the planet s albedo and recirculation efficiency govern its effective day - side and night - side temperatures , @xmath4 and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "observationally , we can only measure the brightness temperature , ideally at a number of different wavelengths : @xmath75 .",
    "if one knew , _ a priori _ , the emergent spectrum of a planet , one could trivially convert a single brightness temperature to an effective temperature .",
    "alternatively , if observations were obtained at a number of wavelengths bracketing the planet s blackbody peak , it would be possible to estimate the planet s bolometric flux and hence its effective temperature in a model - independent way ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we adopt the latter empirical approach of converting observed flux ratios into brightness temperatures , then using these to estimate the planet s effective temperature .",
    "the secondary eclipse depth in some waveband divided by the transit depth is a direct measure of the ratio of the planet s day - side intensity to the star s intensity at that wavelength , @xmath76 . knowing the star s brightness temperature at a given wavelength , it is possible to compute the apparent brightness temperature of the planet s day side : @xmath77^{-1}.\\ ] ]    on the rayleigh - jeans tail , the fractional uncertainty in the brightness temperature is roughly equal to the fractional uncertainty in the eclipse depth ; on the wien tail , the fractional error on brightness temperature can be smaller because the flux is very sensitive to temperature .    by the same token",
    ", a secondary eclipse depth and phase variation amplitude at a given wavelength can be combined to obtain a measure of the planet s night - side brightness temperature at that waveband .    since the albedo and recirculation efficiency of the planet are not known ahead of time , it is not immediately obvious which wavelengths are sensitive to reflected light and which are dominated by thermal emission .",
    "for each planet , we compute the expected blackbody peak if the planet has no albedo and no recirculation of energy , @xmath78  @xmath23 m .",
    "insofar as real planets will have non - zero albedo and non - zero recirculation , the day side should never reach @xmath48 , and the actual spectral energy distribution will peak at slightly longer wavelengths . the coolest planet in our sample , gl  436b , would exhibit a blackbody peak at @xmath79  @xmath23 m , while the hottest planet we consider , wasp-12b , has @xmath80",
    "@xmath23 m . in practice",

    "the red points are the expected brightness temperatures in the j , h , and k@xmath82 bands ( crosses ) , as well as the irac ( asterisks ) and mips ( diamond ) instruments on _ spitzer _ @xcite . since the majority of the observations of exoplanets have been obtained with _",

    "the brightness temperature is assumed to be constant shortward of the shortest-@xmath46 observation , and longward of the longest-@xmath46 observation .",
    "between bandpasses , the brightness temperature changes linearly with @xmath46 .",
    "as long as the various brightness temperatures do not differ grossly from one another , this technique implicitly gives more weight to observations near the hypothetical blackbody peak .",
    "the bolometric flux of this `` model '' spectrum is then computed , and admits a single effective temperature , which is @xmath84  k for the current example .",
    "since we hope to apply our routine to planets with well sampled blackbody peaks , we adopt the linear interpolation technique , as it can make use of multiple brightness temperature estimates near the peak .",
    "the two techniques described above produce similar effective temperatures , though unsurprisingly neither gives precisely the correct answer .",
    "but these systematic errors are comparable or smaller than the photometric uncertainty in observations of individual brightness temperatures ( see table  1 ) . the best ir observations for the nearest , brightest planetary systems ( e.g. , hd  189733b and hd  209458b ) lead to observational uncertainties of approximately 50  k in brightness temperature .",
    "for many planets , the uncertainty is 100200  k. by that metric , either the wien displacement or the linear interpolation routines give adequate estimates of the effective temperature , with errors of 16  k and 14  k , respectively .",
    "we make a more quantitative analysis of the systematic uncertainties involved in the linear interpolation temperature estimates as follows .",
    "we produce 8800 mock data sets : 100 realizations for 11 models and data in up to 8 wavebands ( j , h , k , irac , mips ; since this numerical experiment chooses random bands from the eight available , the results should not be very different if additional wavebands are considered ) .",
    "we run our linear interpolation technique on each of these and plot in figure  [ t_eff_test ] the estimated day - side temperature normalized by the actual model effective temperature versus the number of wavebands used in the estimate .",
    "the temperature estimates cluster near @xmath85 , indicating that the technique is not significantly biased .",
    "the scatter in estimates decreases as more wavebands are used , from a standard deviation of 7.6% if only a single brightness temperature is used , down to 2.4% if photometry is acquired in eight bands .",
    "we incorporate this systematic error into our analysis by adding it in quadrature to the observational uncertainties described in the following paragraph .",
    "this has the desirable effect that planets with fewer observations have a larger systematic uncertainty on their effective temperature .        in practice",
    ", we would like to propagate the photometric uncertainties to the estimate of @xmath25 .",
    "for the wien displacement technique , this uncertainty propagates trivially to the effective temperature . for the linear interpolation technique",
    ", a monte carlo can be used to estimate the uncertainty in @xmath25 : the input eclipse depths are randomly shifted 1000 times in a manner consistent with their photometric uncertainties assuming gaussian errors and the effective temperature is recomputed repeatedly .",
    "the scatter in the resulting values of @xmath25 provides an estimate of the observational uncertainty in the parameter , to which we add in quadrature the estimate of systematic error described above .",
    "the resulting uncertainties are listed in table  1 .",
    "these uncertainties should be compared to the uncertainties in @xmath48 ( also listed in table  1 ) , which are computed using the uncertainty in the star s properties and the planet s orbit .",
    "there are two practical issues with the linear interpolation temperature estimation technique . in some cases ,",
    "only upper limits have been obtained , therefore one could set @xmath86 , with the appropriate 1-sigma uncertainty .",
    "but this approach leads to huge uncertainties in @xmath25 for planets with a secondary eclipse upper - limit near their blackbody peak . instead of `` punishing '' these planets , we opt to not use upper - limits ( though for completeness we include them in table  1 ) . secondly ,",
    "when multiple measurements of an eclipse depth have been published for a given waveband , we use the most recent observation , indicated with a superscript `` _ _ e _ _ '' in table  1 . in all cases",
    "these observations either explicitly agree with their older counterpart , or agree with the re - analyzed older data .",

    "such observations have the potential to directly constrain the albedo of these planets .",
    "one approach is to adopt the @xmath4 from thermal observations and calculate the expected contrast ratio at optical wavelengths , under the assumption of blackbody emission ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "insofar as the observed eclipse depths are deeper than this calculated depth , one can invoke the contribution of reflected light and compute a geometric albedo , @xmath88 .",
    "if one treats the planet as a uniform lambert sphere , the geometric albedo is related to the spherical albedo at that wavelength by @xmath89 .",
    "these values are listed in table  1 .    but reflected light is not the only explanation for an unexpectedly deep optical eclipse .",
    "alternatively , the emissivity of the planets may simply be greater at optical wavelengths than at mid - ir wavelengths , in agreement with realistic spectral models of hot jupiters , which predict brightness temperatures greater than @xmath25 on the wien tail ( see , for example , the fortney et al .",
    "model shown in figure  [ tres3_2pi_tio.flx ] , which does not include reflected light ) .",
    "note that this increase in emissivity should occur regardless of whether or not the planet has a stratosphere : by definition , the depth at which the optical thermal emission is emitted is the depth at which incident starlight is absorbed , which will necessarily be a hot layer assuming the incident stellar spectrum peaks in the optical .",
    "determining the albedo directly ( ie : by observing reflected light ) can be difficult for short period planets , because there is no way to distinguish between reflected and re - radiated photons .",
    "the blackbody peaks of the star and planet often differ by less than a micron . therefore , unlike solar system planets , these worlds do not exhibit a minimum in their spectral energy distribution between the reflected and thermal peaks .",
    "the hottest and therefore most ambiguous case of the five transiting planets with optical constraints is hat - p-7b .",
    "if one takes the mid - ir eclipse depths at face value , the planet has a day - side effective temperature of @xmath90  k. when combined with the kepler observations , one computes an albedo of greater than 50% .",
    "the large day - night amplitude seen in the kepler bandpass is then simply due to the fact that the planet s night - side reflects no starlight , and the cool day - side can be attributed to high @xmath5 and/or @xmath6 .",
    "if , on the other hand , one takes the optical flux to be entirely thermal in origin ( @xmath91 ) , the day - side effective temperature is @xmath92  k. this is very close to that planet s @xmath48 , leaving very little power left for the night - side , again explaining the large day - night contrast observed by kepler .",
    "the truth probably lies somewhere between these two extremes , but in any case this degeneracy will be neatly broken with _",
    "warm spitzer _",
    "observations : the two scenarios outlined above will lead to small and large thermal phase variations , respectively .",
    "it is telling that the only optical measurement in table  1 that is unanimously considered to constrain albedo and not thermal emission is the most observations of hd  209458b @xcite , the coolest of the five transiting planets with optical photometric constraints .",
    "the bottom line is that extracting a constraint on reflected light from optical measurements of hot jupiters is best done with a detailed spectral model .",
    "but even when reflected light can be directly constrained , converting this constraint on @xmath20 into a constraint on @xmath5 also requires detailed knowledge of both the star and the planet s spectral energy distributions , making for a model - dependent exercise .      setting aside optical",

    "there is no reason , on the other hand , that planets should nt lie below the red dotted line in figure  [ beta_vs_t0 ] : all it would take is non - zero bond albedo .",
    "that said , only 3 of the 24 planets we consider are in this region , with the greatest outlier being hd  80606b , a planet on an extremely eccentric orbit with superior conjunction nearly coinciding with periastron .",
    "as such , it is likely that much of the energy absorbed by the planet at that point in its orbit performs mechanical work ( speeding up winds , puffing up the planet , etc .",

    "we have here elected to use all available flux ratios ( including optical observations potentially contaminated by reflected light ) to estimate the day - side bolometric flux and effective temperature , shown as black points in figure  [ beta_vs_t0 ] .",
    "if one takes these day - side effective temperature estimates at face value , it appears that the planets with @xmath105  k exhibit a wide - variety of redistribution efficiencies and/or bond albedos , but are consistent with @xmath103 .",
    "it is worth noting that many of the best characterized planets in this region have @xmath106 , and this accounts for the sharp peak in the dotted line of figure  [ all_r50_n0_both_circulation_hist ] at @xmath107 . the hottest 6 planets , on the other hand , have uniformly high @xmath9 , indicating that they have both low bond albedo _ and _ low redistribution efficiency .",
    "these planets must not have the high - altitude , reflective silicate clouds hypothesized in @xcite .",
    "but this conclusion is dependent on how one interprets the _ kepler _ observations of hat - p-7b : if the large optical flux ratio is due to reflected light , then this planet is cooler than we think , and even the hottest transiting planets exhibit a variety of behaviors .",
    "we have described how to estimate a planet s incident power budget ( @xmath2 ) , where the uncertainties are driven by the uncertainties in the host star s effective temperature and size , as well as the planet s orbit .",
    "we then described a model - independent technique to estimate the effective temperature of a planet based on planet / star flux ratios obtained at various wavelengths .",
    "when the observed day - side and night - side effective temperatures are compared , one can constrain a combination of the planet s bond albedo , @xmath5 , and its recirculation efficiency , @xmath6 .",
    "we applied this analysis on 24 known transiting planets with measured infrared eclipse depths .",
    "we firmly rule out the `` null hypothesis '' , whereby all transiting planets can be fit by a single @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "it is not immediately clear whether this stems from differences in bond albedo , recirculation efficiency , or both .",
    "\\3 . in the few cases where it is possible to unambiguously infer an albedo based on optical eclipse depths , they are extremely low , implying correspondingly low bond albedos ( @xmath108% ) .",
    "if one adopts such low albedos for all the planets in our sample , the discrepancies in day - side effective temperature must be due to differences in recirculation efficiency .",
    "planets cooler than @xmath109  k exhibit a wide variety of circulation efficiencies that do not appear to be correlated with equilibrium temperature .",
    "alternatively , these planets may have different ( but generally low ) albedos .",
    "planets hotter than @xmath109  k have uniformly low redistribution efficiencies and albedos .",
    "the apparent decrease in advective efficiency with increasing planetary temperature remains unexplained .",
    "one hypothesis , mentioned earlier , is that tio and vo would provide additional optical opacity in atmospheres hotter than @xmath110  k , leading to temperature inversions and reduced heat recirculation on these planets @xcite .",
    "but if our sample shows any sharp change it behavior it occurs near 2400  k , rather than  1700  k. one could invoke another optical absorber , but in any case the lack of correlation pointed out in this work and elsewhere between the presence of a temperature inversion and the efficiency of heat recirculation makes this explanation suspect .",
    "another possible explanation for the observed trend is that the hottest planets have the most ionized atmospheres and may suffer the most severe magnetic drag @xcite .",
    "the simplest explanation for this trend is simply that the radiative time is a steeper function of temperature than the advective time : advective efficiency is given roughly by the ratio of the radiative and advective times ( eg : * ? ? ?",
    "in the limit of newtonian cooling , the radiative time scales as @xmath111 .",
    "if one assumes the wind speed to be of order the local sound speed , then the advective time scales as @xmath112 .",
    "one might therefore naively expect the advective efficiency to scale as @xmath113 .",
    "such an explanation would not explain the apparent sharp transition seen at 2400  k , however .",
    "the combination of optical observations of secondary eclipses and thermal observations of phase variations is the best way to constrain planetary albedo and circulation .",
    "the optical observations should be taken near the star s blackbody peak , both to maximize signal - to - noise , and to avoid contamination from the planet s thermal emission , but this separation may not be possible for the hottest transiting planets . the thermal observations , likewise , should be near the planet s blackbody peak to better constrain its bolometric flux .",
    "note that this wavelength is shortward of the ideal contrast ratio , which typically falls on the planet s rayleigh - jeans tail .",
    "furthermore , the thermal phase observations should span a full planetary orbit : the light curve minimum is the most sensitive measure of @xmath6 , and should occur nearly half an orbit apart from the light curve maximum , despite skewed diurnal heating patterns @xcite .",
    "this means that observing campaigns that only cover a little more than half an orbit ( transit @xmath114 eclipse ) are probably underestimating the real peak - trough phase amplitude .",
    "a possible improvement to this study would be to perform a uniform data reduction for all the _ spitzer _ exoplanet observations of hot jupiters .",
    "these data make up the majority of the constraints presented in our study and most are publicly available . and while the published observations were analyzed in disparate ways , a consensus approach to correcting detector systematics is beginning to emerge .",
