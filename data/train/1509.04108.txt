    "run 1 of the cern - lhc on @xmath8 collisions has revealed important new features of the strong interactions at the highest energy region reached by accelerator machines ( 7 tev - 8 tev in the c.m .",
    "system ) and excitement grows with the start of run 2 at 13 tev .",
    "however , despite all the theoretical successes of the standard model , the _ soft strong interactions _ ( small momentum transfer ) still constitute a great challenge for qcd .",
    "once related to large distance phenomena , they are not formally accessed by perturbative techniques and the crucial point concerns the absence of a nonperturbative framework able to provide _ from the first principles _ of qcd a global description of the soft scattering states , namely the experimental data on elastic and inelastic diffractive processes ( single and double dissociation ) and that constitutes a long - standing problem @xcite .",
    "a renewed interest in these processes has been due to the large amount of experimental data on _ elastic scattering _ ( including total cross - section ) that has been provided by the totem collaboration at 7 and 8 tev @xcite , more recently by the atlas collaboration at 7 tev @xcite and also due to the present expectations with run 2 at 13 tev @xcite . beyond the accelerator energy region ,",
    "cosmic - ray experiments constitute the only tool for investigating particle properties and their interactions .",
    "studies on extensive air showers ( eas ) @xcite allow the determination of the proton - air production cross - section and from this quantity , it is possible to estimate the proton - proton cross - section @xcite at energies above 50 tev .",
    "however , in practice , the interpretation of the eas development depends on extrapolations from theoretical formalisms that have been tested only in the accelerator energy region , resulting in rather large theoretical uncertainties , mainly in the estimation of the total cross - section .    in the absence of pure qcd descriptions , the theoretical investigation of the soft strong scattering",
    "is still restricted to a phenomenological context and therefore characterized by some intrinsic limitations .",
    "in fact , although partial descriptions of the bulk of the experimental data can be obtained in the context of phenomenological models ( for reviews see , for example , @xcite ) , the efficiency of any representative approach depends on a constant feedback of new and adjustable parameters , which in turn are dictated by the new experimental data . as a practical consequence",
    ", equivalent data descriptions may be obtained in different phenomenological contexts , associated , in general , to _ different physical pictures for the same phenomenon _",
    "( compare , for example , @xcite ) , resulting , nearly always , in a renewed open problem .    at this stage ,",
    "another important strategy is the development of _ model independent _ descriptions of the experimental data , looking for quantitative _ empirical _ results that may work as an effective bridge for further developments of the qcd in the soft scattering sector and even selecting phenomenological pictures .",
    "as discussed in what follows , that is the point we are interested in here .    among the physical quantities characterizing the elastic hadron - hadron scattering , the ratio @xmath0 between the elastic ( integrated ) and total cross sections as a function of the c.m .",
    "energy @xmath9 , @xmath10 plays an important role for several reasons .",
    "\\1 . in the impact parameter representation ( @xmath11-space ) , it is connected with the opacity ( or blackness ) of the colliding hadrons ; as we shall recall , it is proportional to the central opacity ( @xmath11 = 0 ) in the cases of the gray / black disk or gaussian profiles .",
    "\\2 . due to model - dependence involved in direct measurements of the inelastic cross section",
    ", the @xmath12-channel unitarity constitutes the less biased way to obtain @xmath13 , namely from @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , the same is true for the ratio @xmath15 which , in turn , can be associated with the inelasticity of the collision @xcite .",
    "\\3 . empirical information on @xmath16 and @xmath17 at the highest @xmath12 and as @xmath18 , provides crucial information on the asymptotic properties of the hadronic interactions , namely information on how @xmath19 and @xmath20 reach simultaneously their respective unitarity bounds ( which is one of the main prospects in the lhc forward physics program @xcite ) .",
    "empirical information on asymptopia is also important in the construction and/or selection of phenomenological models , mainly those based or inspired in nonperturbative qcd .",
    "\\4 . through an approximated relation ( to be discussed later ) ,",
    "the ratio @xmath0 can be connected with the ratio between the total cross - section and the elastic slope parameter ( @xmath21 ) , @xmath22 this ratio , extrapolated to cosmic - ray energies , plays an important role in the study of extensive air - showers , as will be discussed along the paper .",
    "moreover , it gives also information on the connection between @xmath19 and @xmath21 at the highest and asymptotic energies .",
    "based on these introductory remarks , our goal here is to present an empirical analysis on the ratio @xmath16 and discuss the implications of the results along the aforementioned lines , with main focus on asymptotic scenarios ( @xmath18 ) . in this respect ,",
    "previous results obtained with smaller sized datasets and treating particular aspects , have already been reported in @xcite ; we shall review these results later .    in the present work ,",
    "our empirical study on the above quantities is once more updated , developed and extended in several aspects .",
    "the dataset on @xmath0 comprises @xmath8 and @xmath23 scattering above 5 gev , including all the totem data at 7 and 8 tev and also the recent atlas datum at 7 tev .",
    "generalizing previous works , we introduce four analytical parameterizations for @xmath16 , consisting of two sigmoid functions composed with two elementary functions of the energy .",
    "arguments and procedures concerning the selection of these suitable empirical parameterizations are presented and discussed in detail . as in @xcite",
    ", we investigate all the three possible asymptotic scenarios : either the standard black disk limit or scenarios above or bellow that limit . depending on the case and variant considered",
    ", the parametrization has only three to five free fit parameters .",
    "based on the @xmath12-channel unitarity , the results for @xmath16 are extended to the inelastic channel , with discussions on the dissociative processes ( single , double diffraction ) , including the pumplin bound .",
    "we also treat the connection between @xmath16 and the ratio @xmath24 , eq .",
    "( [ y ] ) , together with discussions on the applicability of the results in studies of extensive air showers in cosmic - ray experiments .    on the basis of the dataset , empirical parameterizations , fit procedures and results ,",
    "our main four conclusions are the following : ( 1 ) although consistent with the experimental data , the black disk limit does not represent an unique or exclusive solution ; ( 2 ) with the asymptotic @xmath0-value as a free fit parameter , all the data reductions favor a scenario below the black disk , with estimated average result 0.30 @xmath2 0.12 ; ( 3 ) within the uncertainties our selected parameterization and fit result indicate that asymptopia may already be reached around 10@xmath25 tev ; ( 4 ) a change from positive to negative curvature in @xmath16 is predicted at 80 - 100 gev , which suggests a change in the dynamics of the strong interactions associated with the beginning of a saturation effect .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "our analysis on the ratio @xmath0 is developed through sections [ s2 ] to [ s4 ] , where we present : the dataset investigated and the arguments why to treat also limits below and above the black disk ( section [ s2 ] ) ; a detailed discussion on the selection of our empirical parametrization and variants considered ( section [ s3 ] ) ; the fit procedures and the fit results ( section [ s4 ] ) . in section [ s5 ]",
    "we discuss in a comparative way all the data reductions and present our conclusions on the fit results , which lead to the selection of two asymptotic scenarios : semi - transparent and black . in section [ s6 ] ,",

    ", we discuss some possible physical aspects related to the analytical structure of the empirical parameterizations , presenting also comments on a semi - transparent asymptotic scenario .",
    "a summary and our final conclusions are the contents of section [ s8 ] . in two appendixes ,",
    "we present some basic formulas and results referred to along the text ( [ saa ] ) and a short review of our previous works on the subject ( [ sab ] ) .",
    "our dataset comprises all the experimental information presently available on the ratio @xmath0 from @xmath8 and @xmath23 scattering above 5 gev and up to 8 tev ( 42 points : 29 from @xmath8 and 13 from @xmath23 ) and have been collected from @xcite .",
    "the statistical and systematic uncertainties have been added in quadrature .",
    "as we will show , the @xmath8 data at the lhc region play a crucial role in our analysis and conclusions .",
    "these 6 points are displayed in table [ t1 ] : four points at 7 tev , one point at 8 tev obtained by the totem collaboration and one point at 7 tev recently obtained by the atlas collaboration .",
    "for further reference , a plot of the above - mentioned dataset is presented in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] . as illustration",
    ", we have also included an estimation of the ratio @xmath0 at 57 tev , evaluated from the experimental information on @xmath19 and @xmath13 obtained by the pierre auger collaboration @xcite .",

    "the results suggest that the asymptotic region might already be reached around 10@xmath25 tev . that , however , is not the case with the black disk for which typical asymptopia are predicted far beyond 10@xmath30 tev . in what concerns run 2 ,",
    "let us focus on the predictions for @xmath16 at 13 tev .",
    "the four results from tables [ t12 ] and [ t13 ] are schematically summarized in figure [ f7 ] .",
    "although the expected measurements at this energy might not strictly discriminate between the two scenarios it may possible to have an indicative in favor of one of them . even if that were not the case , these new experimental information will certainly be crucial for a better determination of the curvature beyond the inflection point .",
    "with the selected results , let us present extensions and predictions to some other quantities of interest , that did not take part in the data reductions .",
    "the ratio between the inelastic and total cross - section is directly obtained via unitarity , namely 1 - @xmath16 . the results ( analogous to those for @xmath16 in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] ) are displayed in fig .",

    "as expected , all cases present consistent descriptions of the experimental data .",

    "( [ g ] ) and ( [ r ] ) , predict @xmath35    beyond elastic scattering , the soft inelastic diffractive processes ( single and double dissociation ) play a fundamental role in the investigation of the hadronic interactions .",
    "an important formal result on the diffraction dissociation cross - section concerns the pumplin upper bound @xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath37 stands for the soft inelastic diffractive cross section ( the sum of the single and double dissociation cross sections ) . in this context , the black disk limit ( 1/2 ) may be associated with a combination of the soft processes , namely elastic and diffractive , giving room , therefore to a semi - transparent scenario .    in this respect ,",
    "lipari and lusignoli have recentely discussed the experimental data presently available on these processes , calling the attention to the possibility that the pumplin bound may already be reached at the lhc energy region @xcite .",
    "the argument is based on a combination of the measurements by the totem and alice collaborations at 7 tev , which indicates @xmath38 suggesting therefore that the pumplin bound is close to saturation .    in case of saturation , namely the equality in the above equation , it is possible to estimate the ratio @xmath39 at the lhc energies and beyond .",
    "the numerical predictions for this ratio are shown in the fifth columns of table [ t12 ] ( logistic , @xmath28 = 0.293 and @xmath28 = 0.5 ) and table [ t13 ] ( tanh , @xmath28 = 0.312 and @xmath28 = 0.5 ) .",
    "obviously , the asymptotic value of this ratio is zero in the case of a black disk scenario strictly associated with the elastic channel .",
    "moreover , using the pumplin bound and unitarity , we can also infer an upper bound for ratio @xmath40 , namely @xmath41 the curves corresponding to this bound in all cases treated in this section are shown in fig .",
    "[ f9 ] , together with experimental data .",
    "once more , contrasting with the asymptotic null limit in a black disk scenario , our global and reduced estimations ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) , lead to the predictions :    @xmath44      in cosmic - ray studies , the determination of the @xmath8 total cross - section from the proton - air production cross - section is based on the glauber formalism @xcite . in this context",
    ", the nucleon - nucleon impact parameter amplitude ( profile function ) constitutes an important ingredient for the connection between hadron - hadron and hadron - nucleus scattering .",

    "however , models have been tested only in the accelerator energy region and in general are characterized by different physical pictures and different predictions at higher energies . as a consequence , the extrapolations result in large theoretical uncertainties , as clearly illustrated by ulrich _ et al_. @xcite . from the above equation ,",
    "any extrapolation is strongly dependent on the ratio @xmath47 , namely the unknown correlation between @xmath19 and @xmath21 in terms of energy .    one way to overcome",
    "this difficulty is to estimate the ratio @xmath48 through its approximate relation with the ratio @xmath16 , treated in [ saa ] , @xmath49 that has been the motivation of the analysis presented in @xcite :  an almost model - independent parametrization for the above ratio may reduce the uncertainty band in the extrapolations from accelerator to cosmic - ray - energy regions . \"",
    "the behavior of @xmath24 extracted in this way and in all cases treated in this section are shown in fig .",

    "in this section we present some additional comments on two topics : possible physical interpretations associated with our empirical parameterizations ( section 7.1 ) and aspects related to a semi - transparent ( or gray ) asymptotic scenario ( section 7.2 ) .",
    "as we have shown , the sigmoid and elementary functions selected for parameterizing @xmath16 , represent suitable and efficient choices on both statistical and phenomenological grounds .",
    "moreover , a striking feature is associated with the small number of free parameter involved : from 3 to 5 , depending on the procedure . despite the strictly empirical character of our analysis and strategies , let us attempt to connect the results provided by our sigmoid ansatz to some reasonable physical concepts .",
    "the goal is not a direct interpretation of the results , but to discuss some ideas that could contribute with further investigation on the subject .",
    "this discussion is not related to a specific asymptotic scenario but focus only on our choices for the sigmoid and elementary functions .",
    "we discuss two aspects : ( 1 ) the possible connection of @xmath16 with the contribution of effective partonic interactions through the opacity concept ; ( 2 ) the relation of this process with a saturation effect associated to a change of curvature in @xmath16 .    beyond technology and exact sciences , sigmoid functions @xcite have applicability in a great variety of areas , as biological , humanities and social sciences , including neural networks , language change , diffusion of an innovation and many others @xcite .",
    "application in analytic unitarization schemes ( eikonal / u - matrix ) has been considered by cudell , predazzi , selyugin @xcite and a recent application related to polarized gluon density is discussed by bourrely @xcite .",
    "this class of functions is generally associated with the pearl - verhulst logistic processes , in which the growth of a population is bounded and proportional to its size , as well as , to the difference between the size and its bound .",
    "the process may be represented by the logistic differential equation @xcite @xmath50 , \\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the population at a time @xmath52 , @xmath53 is its maximum value ( the carrying capacity ) and @xmath54 is the intrinsic rate of growth ( the growth rate per capita ) . if @xmath55 and/or @xmath56 the equation is with variable coefficients @xcite .    in our case , the logistic ansatz for @xmath3 , eq .

    "( [ xafs ] ) and ( [ v ] ) respectively , this differential equation reads @xmath59 , \\ ] ] corresponding , therefore , to a logistic equation with variable coefficient @xmath60 .    how to interpret this result in the context of elastic hadronic scattering at high energies ?",
    "one conjecture is to look for possible connections with an effective number of partonic interactions taking part in the collision processes , as the energy increases .    with that in mind , we recall that the wide class of qcd inspired models , presently in the literature , had its bases in previous concepts related to semi - hard qcd or mini jet models @xcite .",
    "the main ingredient concerned the separation of soft and semi - hard contributions in the scattering process ; the former treated on phenomenological grounds and the latter determined under perturbative qcd , parton model and probabilistic arguments .",
    "specifically , as recalled in [ saa ] , in terms of the opacity function ( @xmath61 ) , the probability that an inelastic event takes place at @xmath11 and @xmath12 is given by @xmath62 denoting the probability that there are _ no _ soft ( semi - hard ) inelastic interaction by @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) , we can associate @xmath65 so that , the total opacity reads @xmath66    let us now focus on the semi - hard opacity , which is constructed under probabilistic arguments and qcd parton model as follows .",
    "let @xmath67 be the _ number of parton - parton collisions at @xmath12 and @xmath11 , which is associated with the probability of semi - hard inelastic scattering_. since @xmath68 is the probability that there are @xmath69 semi - hard inelastic interactions , mean - free path arguments lead to the conclusion that the probability that hadrons do not undergo sh scattering can be expressed by @xmath70 and therefore , from eq .",
    "[ gi ] , the semi - hard opacity reads @xmath71    in the theoretical context , @xmath67 is expressed in terms of parton - parton cross section and hadronic matter distribution ( related to form factors in the @xmath72-space ) . in general , the formalism involves a rather complex structure with different choices for the corresponding @xmath73 , @xmath74 , constituent cross - sections and form factors ( see , for example , @xcite for a very recent version ) .",
    "however , for our purposes , the main idea is that an effective number of partonic interactions is clearly connected with the opacity and the profile functions and therefore , as recalled in [ saa ] , with the ratio @xmath16 ( at least in what concerns the central opacity in gray disk and gaussian profiles ) . in this context",
    ", the sigmoid behavior characterized by a change of curvature , suggests a change in the rate of effective partonic interactions taking part in the hadronic collisions . a fast rise at low energies is followed by a saturation effect starting at the inflexion point , which represents a change in the dynamics of the interaction .",
    "the energy @xmath9 of the inflection point in terms of the asymptotic ratio @xmath28 and in all cases investigated is displayed in tab .",
    "we see that , despite the different values of @xmath28 , the position of the inflection point lies in a rather restrict interval , namely @xmath29 80 - 100 gev .    concerning this region , we recall that the ua1 collaboration have reported the measurement of low transverse energy clusters ( mini jets ) in @xmath23 collisions at the cern collider and @xmath9 : 200 - 900 gev @xcite .",
    "extrapolation of the observed mini jet cross - section to lower energy ( fig .",
    "10 in @xcite ) suggest that the region 80 - 100 gev is consistent with the beginning of the mini jet production .",
    "now , the rise of the mini jet cross - section has been associated with the observed faster rise of the inelastic and , consequently the total cross - section ( @xcite and references there in ) .",
    "therefore , once @xmath75 , it seems reasonable to associate this behavior with a change of curvature in @xmath0 and the beginning of a saturation effect .",
    "our results are consistent with this conjecture .    although suggestive , we stress that the above arguments are certainly limited as effective physical interpretations of our analysis and results .",
    "however , we hope they may be useful as a possible context for further investigation .      from the discussion in section [ s5 ] , our analysis favors the global result @xmath76 ; a scenario below the black disk .",
    "let us discuss some results and aspects related to the possibility of a semi - transparent scenario .",
    "up to our knowledge , in the mid - seventies , fiakowski and miettinen had already suggested a semi - transparent scenario in the context of a multi - channel approach @xcite ; based on the pumplin bound , this scenario has been also conjectured by sukhatme and henyey @xcite .",
    "more recently , the advent of the lhc brought new expectations concerning the historical search for asymptopia , but interpretation of the data seems not easy in the phenomenological context . in respect to scenarios below the black disk in the pre and lhc era , we recall the facts that follows .",
    "lipari and lusignoli @xcite and achilli et al .",
    "@xcite have discussed the observed overestimation of @xmath20 ( or underestimation of @xmath13 ) in the context of one channel eikonal models . that led grau et al .",
    "@xcite to re - interpret the pumplin upper bound as an effective asymptotic limit , @xmath77 based on the behavior of the experimental data on @xmath16 and a combination of the results at 57 tev by the auger collaboration together with the predictions by block and halzen , grau et al .",
    "have conjectured a rational limit @xmath28 = 1/3 as a possible asymptotic value @xcite ; therefore , consistent with our preferred results .    \\2 . in the recent qcd motivated model by kohara , ferreira and kodama @xcite the scattering amplitude",
    "is constructed under both perturbative and non - perturbative qcd arguments ( related to extensions of the stochastic vacuum model ) .",
    "the model leads to consistent descriptions of the experimental data on @xmath23 and @xmath8 elastic scattering ( forward quantities and differential cross sections ) above 20 gev , including the lhc energies and with extensions to the cosmic - ray energy region .",
    "the predictions for the asymptotic ratio @xmath0 lie below 1/2 and are close to 1/3 ; therefore in agreement with our selected results .",
    "as discussed before , combination of the parameterizations by the compete ( @xmath19 ) and totem ( @xmath20 ) collaborations indicates the asymptotic value @xmath28 = 0.436 .",
    "moreover , combination of the atlas parametrization ( @xmath20 ) @xcite with that by compete reads @xmath28 = 0.456 .",
    "both , therefore , below the black disk .    \\4 . at last",
    ", we stress that through a completely different approach , several individual and simultaneous fits to @xmath19 and @xmath46 data , extended to fit the @xmath20 data @xcite , have led to asymptotic ratios in plenty agreement with our inferred global limit @xmath78 .",
    "all the above facts corroborate the results and conclusions presented here , indicating the semi - transparent limit as a possible asymptotic scenario for the hadronic interactions .    at last",
    ", it may be instructive to recall a crucial aspect related to our subject .",
    "besides empirical analysis on the ratio @xmath0 , another important model - independent way to look for empirical information on the central opacity is through the inverse scattering problem , namely empirical fits to the differential cross section data and inversion of the fourier transform connecting the scattering amplitude and the profile function ( [ saa ] ) . in this context ,",
    "the amaldi and schubert analysis on the @xmath8 data from the cern - isr ( 23.5 @xmath79 62.5 gev ) constitute a classical example of extraction of the inelastic overlap function @xcite .",
    "still restricted to @xmath8 scattering at the isr , but including data from the fermilab at 27.4 gev , several characteristics of the profile , inelastic and opacity function ( in both impact parameter and momentum transfer space ) have been extracted and discussed by menon and collaborators in references @xcite .",
    "the approach is characterized by analytical model - independent parameterizations for the scattering amplitude and analytical propagation of the uncertainties from the fit parameters to all the extracted quantities .",
    "an important observation from these analyses is the necessity of adequate experimental information in the region of large momentum transfer in order to obtain reliable results on the central region ( small impact parameter ) .",
    "this crucial fact was already pointed out by r. lombard in the first blois meeting on elastic and diffractive scattering ( 1985 ) : `` .. extrapolating the measured differential cross section can be made in an infinite number of manners .",
    "some extrapolated curves may look unphysical , but they can not be excluded on mathematical grounds .",
    "'' @xcite .",
    "the experimental data from the isr on @xmath8 collisions cover the region in momentum transfer up to 9.8 gev@xmath80 and with the inclusion of the data from the fermilab , this region can be extended up to 14 gev@xmath80 @xcite , allowing therefore consistent empirical analysis ( see , for example , fig . 7 in @xcite or fig . 1 in @xcite and the detailed discussions in @xcite ) .",
    "that , however , is not the case with the @xmath23 data ( isr , s@xmath23s collider or tevatron ) and , unfortunately , with the @xmath8 data from the lhc neither : the totem measurements cover only the region up to 2.5 or 3.0 gev@xmath80 . as a consequence , propagation of the uncertainties from the extrapolated fits led to rather large uncertainty regions at small values of the impact parameter .",
    "it is interesting to notice that this effect has been clearly pointed out in the theoretical papers by khoze , martin and ryskin ( see , for example , fig . 2 in @xcite and related comments ) .",
    "it is also important to notice that even discrete fourier transforms , through adequate bins intervals in momentum transfer , can not guarantee the consistency of the extracted profile near the central region .",
    "recall that one of the main controversy concerning differential cross sections at large momentum is related to the possibility of oscillation or smooth decrease and/or presence or not of a second dip .",
    "obviously , all these important features ( connected with the central region ) , are completely lost in empirical fits restricted to small or medium values of the momentum transfer ( a fact that is implicit in the aforementioned statement by lombard ) .    on the bases of the above discussion , we understand that only experimental data in the _ deep - elastic scattering region _ ( above @xmath81 4 gev@xmath80 @xcite ) can provide the necessary information for reliable empirical extraction of the profile function ( and opacity ) at and near the central region . in that sense",
    ", it would be very important if the experiments at the lhc could extend the region of momentum transfer . in this respect kawasaki , maehara and yonezawa , stated in 2003 @xcite (",
    "also quoted in @xcite ) :  such experiments will give much more valuable information for the diffraction interaction rather than to go to higher energies \" .",
    "we have presented an empirical analysis on the energy dependence of the ratio @xmath75 , with focus on its asymptotic limit . the main ingredient concerned four analytical parameterizations constructed through composition of sigmoid and elementary functions of the energy . for each sigmoid , @xmath82 ( logistic or hyperbolic tangent ) , two elementary functions , @xmath83 ,",
    "were considered , given by a linear function plus a power law ( @xmath5 ) or a logarithmic law ( @xmath6 ) of the standard variable @xmath84 , with @xmath85 . by expressing @xmath86 , with @xmath28 the asymptotic limit ,",
    "two fit procedures have been considered , either constrained ( @xmath28 fixed , imposing the asymptotic limit ) or unconstrained ( @xmath28 as a free parameter , selecting the asymptotic limit ) .",
    "based on empirical and formal arguments , we have investigated 5 limits from @xmath28 = 0.3 up to @xmath28 = 1 ( maximum unitarity ) , including the black disk case , @xmath28 = 0.5 .",
    "altogether , we have developed 40 data reductions , associated with 5 asymptotic assumptions , 2 sigmoid functions composed with 2 elementary functions and 2 procedures ( unconstrained and constrained ) .",
    "the dataset comprised all the experimental data available on the ratio @xmath0 above 5 gev ( and up to 8 tev ) .",
    "this detailed empirical analysis led to two main results :    r1 . taking into account",
    "the statistical information and uncertainties , all _ constrained _ fits ( @xmath28 fixed ) presented consistence with the experimental data analyzed , even in the extrema cases , @xmath28 = 0.3 or @xmath28 = 1.0 . in other words ,",

    "although consistent with the experimental data analyzed , the black disk limit does not represent an unique or exclusive solution .",
    "our analysis favors a limit below the black disk , namely a gray or semi - transparent scenario , with @xmath28 given above .",
    "based on these two conclusions and given the ubiquity of the black disk scenario in eikonal models , we have presented along the text the results and several predictions considering both the black and semi - transparent cases with the logistic and hyperbolic tangent and restricted to our variant @xmath6 ( since it presents the smaller number of free parameters ) .    an important characteristic distinguishing the two scenarios concerns the approach to the asymptotic region . in the semi - transparent scenario asymptopia may already be reached around 10@xmath25 tev and in the case of the black disk only far beyond 10@xmath30 tev .    in what concerns our empirical parameterizations",
    ", it seems important to stress their efficiency in describing the experimental data analyzed , independently of the fixed physical value of @xmath28 and despite the noticeable small number of free parameters .",
    "for example , the constrained black disk fit with the variant @xmath6 demands only three fit parameters and led to consistent description of all data .",
    "we stress , once more , the contrast with 10 or more parameters typical of individual fits to @xmath19 and @xmath20 data .",
    "all that indicate the good quality of our analytical choices for @xmath3 and @xmath4 , on empirical and phenomenological grounds .    given the empirical efficiency of these _ analytical representations _ for @xmath16 ,",
    "we have attempted to look for possible physical connections with the underline theory / phenomenology of the soft strong interactions .",
    "presently , as a first step , we can only devise some suggestive ideas relating a  population growth \" , represented by the logistic differential equation , with the number of effective parton interactions taking part in the collision .",
    "this number increases at low energies , tending to a saturation as the energy increases above the 80 - 100 gev region . despite suggestive ,",
    "this conjecture is rather limited on physical grounds and must be investigated in more detail .",
    "it seems difficult to consider as accidental the semi - transparent scenario indicated in a variety of independent analyses as those presented here , as well as in our previous works @xcite and other indications referred to in the text .",
    "it is worth mentioning that an asymptotic scenario distinct of the black disk has been recently discussed by i. dremin , in the context of unitarity and a gaussian profile approach @xcite . in this analysis",
    "the opacity is maximum at a finite value of the impact parameter and the central opacity is determined by the parameter @xmath88 .",
    "the asymptotic limit @xmath89 corresponds to complete transparency , leading the author to propose a black torus ( or a black ring ) as a possible asymptotic scenario . since , from appendix a",
    ", @xmath90 , with our preferred restricted asymptotic result @xmath43 ( 19 ) , we predict @xmath91 corresponding , therefore , to a central semi - transparent core and not complete transparency .",
    "this asymptotic scenario , represented by a black ring surrounding a gray disk , has been also predicted by desgrolard , jenkovszky and struminsky , in a different context @xcite .",
    "at last , we stress that the new experimental data from run 2 might not be decisive as a direct numerical selection of the scenarios discussed here ( in terms of our predictions ) .",
    "however , this experimental information on @xmath16 will be crucial for an improved determination of the curvature above the inflection point and consequently providing better accesses to the asymptotic region in model - independent analyses .",
