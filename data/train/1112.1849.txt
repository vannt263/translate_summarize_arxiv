    "deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) off the deuteron target has recently attracted much attention from the experimental point of view @xcite .",
    "one of the main reasons of this interest is the fact that the dvcs process gives information about the generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) . from the theoretical point of view , the leading twist-2 gpds for the deuteron were studied in @xcite .",
    "however , the leading twist-2 accuracy for the dvcs amplitude , calculated in the case where the final deuteron gets a significant transverse momentum , is not enough for the study of such processes .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the essential case of sizable transverse transfer momentum , @xmath1 , the leading twist-2 approximation , in the bjorken limit , is not sufficient for the photon gauge invariance of the dvcs amplitude ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "gauge invariance of the amplitude rather than the @xmath2 gauge invariance .",
    "concerning the qcd gauge , we fix it by choosing the axial gauge for gluons , @xmath3 . ] besides , the relevant terms are proportional to the transverse component of the momentum transfer and provide the leading contribution to some observables .    extending the ellis - furmanski - petronzio - efremov - teryaev ( efpet ) approach ( see , ) to the non - forward case",
    ", this problem was first solved in @xcite where it was demonstrated how the inclusion of twist-3 contributions related to the matrix elements of quark - antiquark - gluon operators , can restore the gauge invariance of the dvcs amplitude off a ( pseudo)scalar particle ( e.g. pion , @xmath4 ) .",
    "then , the main ideas of @xcite were used and generalized for the nucleon target ( see , @xcite and @xcite for different processes ) .    in this paper",
    ", we adhere to the approach @xcite and make a comprehensive analysis of the twist three contributions to the dvcs amplitude off a spin-1 hadron .",
    "since the parameterizations of the relevant hadronic matrix elements of the quark - gluon operators depend much on the spin of the external hadrons , following the very useful idea of @xcite we start our study with a parametrization - free approach , and then apply it to the specific case of spin-@xmath0 hadron .",
    "let us start with the discussion of the kinematics and approximations which we use in this paper .",
    "the process we consider is @xmath5 here , we mainly focus on the deuteron as a target but all our approach is suitable for any spin - one hadron target . at the born level ,",
    "the feynman diagrams corresponding to the considered process are depicted in fig .",
    "this process is a hard exclusive reaction for which a qcd factorization theorem applies . in this case , the virtuality of the initial off - shell photon is used as the large scale , i.e. @xmath6 , while the final photon is on - shell with @xmath7 .",
    "besides , this asymptotical regime is identical to the light - cone formalism .",
    "therefore , we first introduce a light - cone basis which is constructed by the `` plus '' and `` minus '' vectors : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is an arbitrary and dimensionful constant which can be expressed via the lorentz invariants . the exact form of @xmath9 as a function of invariants depends on the frame which one works in .         in the present paper ,",
    "we consider the dvcs amplitude up to the twist three accuracy , discarding the contributions associated with the twist four and higher .",
    "such a constraint imposes the following relations for the hadron average and transfer momenta : @xmath10 notice that keeping the @xmath11-term in the sudakov decomposition of the relative momentum @xmath12 ( see , ( [ kin ] ) ) leads to the necessity to include the twist four contributions as well , which goes beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "since corrections of the order @xmath13 demand a special care , at this moment , we postpone the study of them until a forthcoming paper .",
    "notice that the detailed analysis of these contributions has recently been presented in @xcite .",
    "it is also instructive to introduce the photon average momentum : @xmath14 one has to emphasize that the approximations discussed in this section do not affect the generality of our study and can be applied to a study of arbitrary spin hadrons .",
    "in this section , we briefly describe the factorization procedure applied to the dvcs amplitude up to the twist three accuracy .",
    "the details of this factorization can be found in @xcite .    at the born level ,",
    "the sum of the amplitudes with the two- and three - particle correlators , or @xmath15 and @xmath16 amplitudes , has the following form ( for the dis case , see @xcite ) : @xmath17\\\\ & & + \\int d^4 k_1 \\",

    "( [ 1 ] ) , we use the following notations : @xmath20 where the underlined indices @xmath21 denote the dirac spin indices while the other indices correspond to the lorentz ones .",
    "it is convenient to choose the axial gauge condition for gluons , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the light - cone vector defined in eq .",
    "( [ lcb ] ) .",
    "then , we carry out a decomposition of the loop momentum @xmath24 over the light - cone vectors ( the sudakov decomposition ) as follows @xmath25 where @xmath26 . as the next step of the factorization procedure , we perform the replacement for the integration momentum in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) as @xmath27 this allows us to expand the two - quark coefficient function @xmath18 ( see , ( [ 1 ] ) ) in a taylor series : @xmath28 then , using the collinear ward identity ( see , @xcite ) @xmath29 we , finally , arrive at the factorized ( in the momentum space ) dvcs amplitude which reads @xmath30 \\\\ & & + \\ , \\int\\limits_{-1}^{1 } dx_1\\ , dx_2\\ , \\text{tr}\\biggl [ e_{\\mu\\rho\\nu}(x_1 , x_2 ) \\omega^{\\rho\\rho^{\\prime } } \\gamma_{\\rho^{\\prime } } ( x_1 , x_2 ) \\biggr]\\label{1.1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 , and @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the qcd covariant derivative in the fundamental representation .",
    "this amplitude is also needed to be ",
    "factorized  in the dirac space .",
    "this can be reached by making use of the fierz decomposition over spinor indices .",
    "in fact , the contributions of @xmath34 are not completely independent from one another because of the qcd equations of motion ( e.o.m . ) for fermions .",
    "the next step is to use the qcd e.o.m . in order to reexpress the contributions of the correlators with the covariant derivative through the correlators which include only @xmath35 and @xmath36 fields .",
    "afterwards , the contribution of @xmath34 presented in terms of the two - particle correlators should be combined together with the contribution of @xmath37 in order to get the gauge invariant dvcs amplitude at the born level .",
    "let us now focus on the qcd equations of motion .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we start within the approximation where the three - particle correlators are absent . indeed , to derive the gauge invariant amplitude , it is sufficient to consider only the kinematical twist contributions since the kinematical and dynamical twists enter in the qcd e.o.m . and the dvcs amplitude additively ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let us consider the e.o.m . in the following form :",
