    "on the face of it , the massless dirac spectrum of the monolayer graphene is well established@xcite .",

    "it is usually traced back to the mutual displacement of the sublattices .",
    "the question arises : what is the nature of this displacement .",
    "one of the possibilities is the effect of structure defects .",
    "our goal here is to investigate an alternative possibility : a dynamical symmetry break accompanied by generation of a gap ( mass ) due to strong enough electron - phonon interaction .",
    "such phenomenon is well studied in the superconductivity @xcite , gross - neveu model of the quantum field theory @xcite , and the theory of organic quasi - one - dimensional conductors @xcite .",
