    "ultrafast nonlinear optical signals in the condensed phase usually use heterodyne detection , whereby the signal interferes with a reference local oscillator beam .",
    "the signal then scales linearly with the number of molecules @xmath0 and is distinguished by its power dependence in the incoming fileds and its direction ( phase matching ) @xcite .",
    "matter information is contained in multipoint correlation functions of the dipole operator .",
    "we will refer to such signals as direct . while linear spectroscopy reveals the one - photon excitation spectrum of the sample , nonlinear spectroscopies contain multi - photon transitions and can probe dynamics in a controlled way .",
    "for example , in a pump - probe stimulated raman experiment , a sample is excited by two interactions with an initial light pulse to a vibrational coherence which is then probed by a second pulse following a time delay @xmath1 .",
    "this technique probes the vibrational structure of the molecule and is a 3rd - order process in the electric field ( and is therefore related to @xmath2 , the 3rd - order susceptibility ) .",
    "an extension of this technique is a 5th - order raman process in which , following the initial delay @xmath1 , a second pair of interactions transfers the sample from one vibrational coherence to another .",
    "the system then evovles freely during a second interpulse delay @xmath3 before being probed .",
    "this more general 5th - order ( @xmath4 ) technique offers the possibility of probing the coupling between participating vibrational modes .",
    "another type of signal is also generated by a sequential process : some fields interact with one molecule to generate a field which then acts on another molecule , together with the external fields , to finally produce a signal .",
    "such signals scale as @xmath5 and are known as cascading .",
    "the cascading signals have the same power dependence in the incoming fields and the same phase matching and are thus hard to distinguish from the direct signal @xcite . in neat liquids ,",
    "cascading dominates the direct signal due to the quadratic _ vs. _  linear scaling in molecular density .",
    "it is then hard to separate the direct signal , which carries a higher level of molecular information .",
    "an important example is the direct 5th - order raman @xmath4 process which is accompanied by a product of two 3rd - order @xmath2 signals . separating the two",
    "had drawn considerable attention and took several years to recognize @xcite .",
    "this has been the main obstacle for multidimensional raman spectroscopy ( 5th - and - higher orders ) @xcite .",
    "a number of ideas have been pursued to separate these undesired cascading signals .",
    "the @xmath0 _ vs. _",
    "@xmath5 scaling is an obvious way to separate the cascading and direct contributions but in many cases ( e.g. , 5th - order raman in neat molecular liquids ) , it is not possible to vary the molecular density over a sufficiently - large range in order to seperate the @xmath0- and @xmath5-scaling contributions .",
    "another idea comes from the fact that , in an infinite homogeneous sample , it follows from maxwell s equations that the electric field emitted by a polarization is @xmath6 phase - shifted relative to the polarization itself . from a macroscopic perspective ,",
    "the electric field @xmath7 created by a polarization @xmath8 is given by the maxwell equation @xmath9 which in the frequency domain reads @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a positive infinitessimal selecting the appropriate boundary conditions of an outgoing wave .",
    "in the limit of perfect phase matching @xmath12 , we have @xmath13 this gives a @xmath14 phase shift between the polarization and the resulting field",
    ". we will derive a more general , geometry - dependent result and show under what conditions it reduces to this simple macroscopic relation . the extra emission event ( from the source molecule ) in a cascading process thus renders the cascading signal out of phase relative to the direct nonlinear signal ( @xmath15 ) @xcite .",
    "this property has been parlayed into a number of successfully - implemented techniques to select for the direct 5th - order raman signal and eliminate the cascading contributions @xcite ( techniques based on polarization - sensitive measurements have also been pursued @xcite ) .    in this paper , we extend our earlier treatment of cascading to study this phase shift on a microscopic level @xcite . we show that the @xmath14 phase - shift described above occurs in the limit of macroscopic homogeneity only for certain geometries and does not hold for samples consisting of only a few particles .",
    "the essence of this geometry - related phase comes from 2d integrations as was described by feynman for the emitted field by an infinite sheet of dipoles @xcite .",
    "after tracing over quantum field degrees of freedom , general expressions for cascading signals are given that are valid in the non - perturbative regime with respect to arbitrary external fields .",
    "the result can then be expressed solely as a product of two single - molecule dipole correlation functions and a geometric factor describing the relative positions of the molecules in the sample .",
    "this presentation allows the calculation of cascading signals using only the single - molecule calculations familiar from standard treatments of nonlinear spectroscopy and a sum of c - numbers associated with the geometry .",
    "this paper extends our previous line of reasoning @xcite which framed cascading signals as a subset of a more general class of vacuum - mediated interactions which includes local - field effects and other higher - order processes .",
    "we then obtained microscopic expressions for the first few orders ( in external fields ) for these vacuum - mediated effects .",
    "the focus of this paper is the study of the macroscopic continuum limit and a comparison with a microscopic collection of ( few ) molecules .",
    "in the semiclassical approach to nonlinear optical spectroscopy , a quantum material system interacts with only a few classical modes of the radiation field and the remaining infinite number of modes , which are in their vacuum states , are neglected . however , taking the vacuum modes into account in a fully quantum electrodynamical ( qed ) treatement can result in several many - body effects caused by photon exchange , i.e. , the emission of a photon by one molecule and its absorption by another .",
    "these effects include the scrambling of the time ordering of incoming short pulses where the free - induction decay produced by one molecule can be long - lived and interacts with another molecule , a local - field @xmath16 effect @xcite .",
    "additional local - field effects include corrections to the transmission / reflection of a thin film @xcite and the rabi oscillations of a quantum dot @xcite .",
    "nonlinearities are also induced in ensembles of noninteracting harmonic oscillators which are otherwise linear @xcite .",
    "dipole - dipole coupling , responsible for , e.g. , forster resonant energy transfer ( fret ) and spontaneous quantum synchronization , is also induced by the exchange of photons @xcite .",
    "superradiance , a cooperative spontaneous emission process , is another well - studied effect that finds its origin in the quantum nature of the radiation field @xcite .",
    "quantum - field effects due to quantum fluctuations of the laser field rather than the unoccupied modes of the electromagnetic field have also been noted in stimulated signals @xcite .",
    "this paper analyzes the aforementioned cascading contribution to heterodyne - detected nonlinear spectroscopic signals by treating them as the lowest - order many - body correction due to photon exchange .    cascading shares a common origin with other collective effects observed in spectroscopic experiments .",
    "for example , superradiant emission also arises from collective coupling of the constituent molecules of the sample to a photon mode and scales quadratically in the number of molecules @xcite .",
    "however , in superradiance the spontaneously emitted photons ( or the associated excited - state population decay ) are ordinarily the object of detection while in cascading the exchanged photons are virtual and the relevant experiment is a heterodyne detection with respect to the externally - applied signal ( laser ) field . the lamb shift and collective analogues are also due to virtual - photon exchange but these effects are observed as alterations of a material resonance rather than an entirely new signal as in cascading @xcite .",
    "forster transfer ( discussed more thoroughly in the conclusion ) can also be derived perturbatively as a vacuum - mediated interaction . when the field - matter interaction is treated in the dipole approximation ,",
    "all of the above depend on the dipole - dipole coupling tensor , giving the derivations a similar flavor @xcite .",
    "we consider a sample made of identical , noninteracting molecules with non - overlapping charge distributions for which the coupling to the radiation field can be treated in the dipole approximation .",
    "the total system dipole operator then takes the form of a sum over molecular dipoles @xmath17 .",
    "the material is subjected to a set of classical laser modes @xmath18 so that the total electric field is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is an electric field operator representing the infinitely - many vacuum modes . the material system is coupled to this total electric field via the interaction hamiltonian @xmath21 where the laser modes and the quantum vacuum interact with the material via hamiltonians @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "heterodyne - detected nonlinear spectroscopic signals are given by the rate - of - change of photon number in some signal mode @xmath24 , taken to be in a coherent state .",

    "all field - matter interactions in the perturbative expansion then occur on a given molecule and the signal is obtained by summing over molecules .",
    "these signals thus scale linearly with the number of molecules in the sample @xmath0 , are proportional to the single - molecule signal suitably averaged , and contain no cooperative many - body contributions .",
    "the presence of the quantum vacuum modes of the radiation field creates corrections to this picture .",
    "we can systematically generate such corrections by expanding the second exponent in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vtimeexp ] ) ( the vacuum - mode terms ) . since @xmath37=0 $ ]",
    ", the 2nd - order expansion is the lowest non - vanishing correction .",
    "this represents successive emission and re - absorption of a photon by the material . when the same molecule both emits and absorbs this photon , the result is the lowest - order radiative correction , or one - loop correction , to the energy ( lamb shift with radiative decay @xcite ) . the terms in which the absorber and emitter are different molecules lead to a transfer of a coherent excitation between the two molecules which is the origin of cascading .",
    "this is depicted diagrammatically in fig .",

    "( [ eq : ptotal ] ) is the direct nonlinear signal and comes proportional to the sample s form factor @xmath53 this factor carries information on the position of the molecules in the sample and , in the continuum limit , goes over to the delta function @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the molecular concentration .",
    "this corresponds to momentum conservation and yields the phase matching condition . the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ptotal ] ) is the cascading signal in which the polarization of molecule @xmath47 serves as a source , along with the external fields , for the polarization of molecule @xmath46 .",
    "note that when this is expanded to order @xmath56 in the classical modes , we will have @xmath57 .",
    "the traditional nomenclature is to refer to those terms with @xmath58 as local - field corrections and the remainder as cascading ( the most familiar being @xmath59 but 3,5 cascading has also been discussed @xcite ) .",
    "even though eq .",

    "moreover , eq .  ( [ eq : ptotal ] ) reveals the important point that , in the off - resonant limit where @xmath62 only has the phase imprinted by the external fields , the relative phase of cascading versus direct processes will be controlled entirely by @xmath63 . in the limit of a large , homogeneous sample , the spatial dependence of the photon green s function is reduced to the single variable @xmath64 , the difference vector , and we have @xmath65 where @xmath66 directly controls the phase ( i.e. , if this quantity is real then the cascading process is in phase with the direct process and if it is purely imaginary the two processes are out of phase ) and the second relation follows on taking the integral in the continuum limit . in this regime , the total polarization is thus @xmath67 where we have assumed perfect phase - matching @xmath68 and both choices of @xmath69 must be summed over .    equation ( [ eq : ptotal2 ] ) is in the form of the simple macroscopic expression discussed in the introduction that is in common use to understand the cascading contribution to nonlinear signals .",
    "it reveals that the cascading contribution carries an additional factor of molecular density @xmath70 compared to the direct signal .",
    "recalling that the form factor also scales linearly with @xmath70 in the continuum limit , the direct signal is linear while the cascading is quadratic .",
    "the crucial factor of @xmath71 responsible for the phase shift that is used to filter out cascades is found to originate in the phase - matching condition .",
    "finally , it is worthwhile to note the linear dependence on @xmath72 in the cascading contribution , indicating that it will be stronger at higher , such as x - ray , frequencies .    in making the assumption that @xmath68 , we have neglected the principal value of the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : glimits ] ) which generates a cascading contribution that is _ in phase _ with the direct signal .",
    "additionally , the situation can be expected to be different in the case of few - molecule samples or oddly - shaped macroscopic systems . in the next section ,",
    "we examine these effects in greater detail .     or @xmath47 and associated propagators .",
    "we use doubled lines to clarify that the propagation is with respect to the full hamiltonian , including interactions with externally applied fields , and not simply the field - free material propagation . the straight line intersecting the density matrices of molecule",
    "@xmath46 represents the heterodyne signal field while the wavy lines represent interactions with vacuum modes .",
    "in contrast to the more familiar double - sided feynman diagrams , we make no distinction between action on the ket or bra .",
    "this is permissible since we work in liouville space and convenient since it permits us to work in the @xmath73 representation in which the liouvillian @xmath74 is more compactly written .",
    "this therefore greatly reduces the number of diagrams .",
    "since we work in the @xmath73 representation and without the rotating wave approximation , dressing the interactions with arrows ( to indicate positive or negative fourier components ) is unneccesary .",
    "this diagram corresponds to the quantities relevant for equation ( [ eq : sexp1 ] ) . ]",
    "from the previous section , it is clear that , for the off - resonant response , the @xmath75-space photon green s function ( eq .  ( [ eq : glimits ] ) determines the phase of the cascading signal . in the semiclassical description , the effective electric field emitted by molecule @xmath47",
    "is given by a phase - shift of the polarization @xmath76 .",
    "the extra factor of @xmath71 , which in this semiclassical picture comes from the additional emision event inherent in cascading processes , renders the cascading terms out of phase with the direct nonlinear terms .",

    "we evaluate the photon green s function for different geometries and show under what conditions the cascaded signal acquires this well - defined phase shift .    to simplify the analysis , we will separate the summations ( integrations ) over the positions over the two molecules .",

    "we assume the following interaction hamiltonian @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the scalar polarization , and @xmath86 is the scalar field that replaces the full electromagnetic counterpart , so that the maxwell equations are replaced with the helmholtz equation ( @xmath87 ) , whose green s function ( that replaces the green s function of the maxwell equations , also known as the green s function of the electromagnetic field ) has the form @xmath88 we will further switch to the uniform continuum limit wherein all properties of the cascaded signal , compared to its direct counterpart are fully contained in the integral    @xmath89    where @xmath90 denotes the integration region , occupied by the sample .",

    "thus , for intermolecular seperations much less than this , the static dipole - dipole coupling is dominant while for much larger distances , the long - range @xmath135 term is dominant .",

    "the cascading signal will generally produce both in - phase and out - of - phase terms of varying dependence on the intermolecular separation vector @xmath150 and cascading wavevector @xmath45 .",
    "the uniform integration over the interaction volume cross - section was found to be responsible for this phase - shift , along the same lines as explicated by feynman for a sheet of dipoles @xcite .",
    "a phase - matching condition @xmath151 , where @xmath113 is the thickness of the sample , was identified as necessary for the in - phase component of the cascaded signal to vanish .",
    "this condition can be achieved in thin films or guaranteed by a co - linear beam geometry . because they scale quadratically in molecular concentration ,",
    "the cascading terms often dominate direct nonlinear signals",
    ". additionally , the cascading signal scales linearly with the frequency @xmath140 of the emitting polarization .",
    "this implies that cascading processes will become even more dominant at higher frequencies , such as in x - ray raman experiments , necessitating a thorough understanding of cascading processes for data analysis purposes @xcite .",
    "we are now in a position to appreciate the difference between cascading and fluorescence resonant energy transfer ( fret ) .",
