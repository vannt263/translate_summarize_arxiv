    "the idea suggested by skyrme @xcite that baryon physics could emerge as solitons from an effective lagrangian of meson fields remains one of the most original and successful attempts for the description of the low - energy regime of the theory of strong interactions ( qcd ) .",
    "although it predates qcd and was almost eclipsed by it , the proposal gained strong support when it was realized that , in the large @xmath4 limit , qcd is equivalent to an effective theory of mesons @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most important feature of the skyrme model in that regard is that the soliton solutions which arise are characterized by a conserved topological charge , the winding number , which skyrme identified as the baryon number . in other words , in this scheme , the baryons as well as nuclei are simply topological solitons .    in its original formulation ,",
    "the skyrme model succeeds in predicting the properties of the nucleon within a precision of 30% .",
    "this is considered a rather good agreement for a two - parameter theory @xcite . however , a number of generalizations of the model have been proposed to improve this concordance with baryon and nuclear physics .",
    "they mostly exploit our ignorance of the exact form of the low - energy effective lagrangian of qcd for example , the structure of the mass term @xcite , the contribution of other vector mesons @xcite or simply the addition of higher - order terms in derivatives of the pion fields @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , for now , qcd alone only gives hints that such extensions should appear and the complete determination of the effective skyrme - like lagrangian remains a most serious challenge .    despite such efforts ,",
    "one of the recurring problems of skyrme - like lagrangians is that they almost inevitably lead to large binding energy for nuclei already at the classical level .",
    "a solution may be at hand by constructing effective lagrangians with soliton solutions that saturate the bogomolnyi bound , i.e. so - called bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield type ( bps ) skyrmions , since their classical static energy grows linearly with the baryon number @xmath5 ( or atomic number ) much like the nuclear mass .",
    "support for this idea comes from a recent result from sutcliffe @xcite who found that bps - type skyrmions seem to emerge for the original skyrme model when a large number of vector mesons are added .",
    "the additional degrees of freedom cause the mass of the soliton to decrease down to the saturation of the bogomolnyi bound .",
    "a different and more direct approach was proposed by adam , sanchez - guillen , and wereszczynski ( asw ) @xcite by means of a prototype model consisting of only two terms : one of order six in derivatives of the pion fields @xcite and a second term , called the potential , which is chosen to be the customary mass term for pions in the skyrme model @xcite .",
    "the model leads to bps - type compacton solutions with size and mass growing as @xmath6 and @xmath5 respectively , a result in general agreement with experimental observations .",
    "however , the connection between the asw model and pion physics , or the skyrme model , is more obscure due to the absence of the nonlinear @xmath1 and so - called skyrme terms which are of order 2 and 4 in derivatives , respectively .    following this picture , some of us @xcite have reexamined a more realistic generalization of the skyrme model which includes terms up to order six in derivatives @xcite in the sector where the nonlinear @xmath1 and skyrme terms are small . in that limit and for an appropriate choice of mass term , it is possible to find well - behaved analytical solutions for the static solitons .",
    "since they saturate the bogomolnyi bound , their static energy is directly proportional to @xmath5 and we recover some of the results in ref .",
    "in fact , these solutions allow computing analytically the mass of the nuclei ( static and rotational energy ) in the regime where quadratic and quartic terms are small perturbations . adjusting the four parameters of the model to fit the resulting binding energies per nucleon with respect to the experimental data of the most abundant isotopes",
    "leads to an impressive agreement .",
    "these results support the idea of a bps - type skyrme model as the dominant contribution to an effective theory for the properties of nuclear matter .",
    "however , a few issues remain to be addressed before such a model is considered viable .",
    "we shall concentrate on two of them in this work .",
    "first , as for most extensions of the skyrme model , the bps - type models in refs . @xcite and @xcite generate shell - like configurations for the energy and baryon densities as opposed to what experimental data suggests , i.e. almost constant densities in the nuclei .",
    "we show here that it is possible to construct an effective lagrangian which leads to nonshell configurations and still preserves the agreement with nuclear data .",
    "the second issue concerns the inclusion of the coulomb energy and the isospin symmetry breaking term in the calculation of nuclear masses . in the context of the skyrme model",
    ", these contributions have been thoroughly studied for @xmath7 @xcite but are usually neglected , to a first approximation , for higher @xmath5 since they are not expected to overcome the binding energies which are usually large and also because finding the configurations is already numerically challenging so that only small @xmath5 solutions are known ( e.g. approximate toroidal , tetrahedral , cubic configurations for @xmath8 standard skyrmions , respectively ) . however , for our type of near - bps model , they may have a significant impact on the predictions given the already good agreement with data .",
    "moreover , it turns out that the calculation of the coulomb energy is simplified by the axial symmetry of the solutions and is calculable for all @xmath5 .",
    "we propose to study the model based on the lagrangian density @xmath9 with @xmath10 \\label{l2}\\\\ \\mathcal{l}_{4 }   &   = \\beta\\text{tr}\\left (   \\left [   l_{\\mu},l_{\\nu}\\right ] ^{2}\\right ) \\label{l4}\\\\ \\mathcal{l}_{6 }   &   = -\\frac{3}{2}\\frac{\\lambda^{2}}{16^{2}}\\text{tr}\\left ( \\left [   l_{\\mu},l_{\\nu}\\right ]   \\left [   l^{\\nu},l^{\\lambda}\\right ]   \\left [ l_{\\lambda},l_{\\mu}\\right ]   \\right )   \\label{l6}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the left - handed current of the meson fields represented by the @xmath12 matrix @xmath13 which obey the nonlinear condition @xmath14    the constants @xmath15 @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are left as free parameters of the model although we shall be interested in the regime where @xmath16 and @xmath19 are small . the original skyrme model was built out of only the nonlinear @xmath1 term , @xmath20 and the skyrme term , @xmath21 .",
    "one often adds the so - called mass term , @xmath22 to take into account chiral symmetry breaking and generate a pion mass term for small fluctuations of the chiral field in @xmath23 .",
    "finally , the term of order six in derivatives of the pion fields @xmath24 is equivalent to @xmath25 that was first proposed by jackson et al . @xcite to allow for the possibility of @xmath26-meson interactions . here",
    ", we define the topological ( baryon ) current density @xmath27 @xmath28 the boundary condition at infinity must be constant to ensure that solutions for the skyrme field have finite energy but it also characterizes solutions by a conserved topological charge , @xmath29 the static energy arising from @xmath24 comes from the square of the baryon density@xmath30 so in a sense , it is the analog of the coulomb energy @xmath31 except that instead of following the @xmath32 law , the interaction is replaced by a @xmath33function@xmath34 in other words , the baryonic charge interacts locally .",
    "historically , @xmath35 and @xmath24 were introduced to provide a more general effective lagrangian than the original skyrme model and indeed , the lagrangian in ( [ model0to6 ] ) represents the most general @xmath12 model with at most two time derivatives . as an effective theory based on the @xmath36 expansion of qcd , there no reason to believe that higher - order derivatives should be absent",
    "however , since one generally relies on the standard hamiltonian interpretation for the quantization procedure , higher - order time derivatives are usually avoided .    as a result",
    ", the model has been studied extensively but remarkably , this was done only for values of parameters @xmath15 @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 close to that of the original skyrme model .",
    "presumably these choices were made so that @xmath37 and @xmath21 would continue to have a significant contribution to the mass of the baryons and thereby preserve the relative successes of the skyrme model in predicting nucleon properties and their link to pion physics ( @xmath16 is proportional to the pion decay constant @xmath38 ) . yet",
    "this sector of the theory fails to provide an accurate description of the binding energy of heavy nuclei .    noting that this caveat may come from the fact that the solitons of the skyrme model do not saturate the bogomolnyi bound , asw proposed a model @xcite ( equivalent to setting @xmath39 whose solutions are bps - type solitons and have lower binding energies .",
    "a more realistic approach was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to analyze the full lagrangian ( [ model0to6 ] ) in the sector where @xmath16 and @xmath19 are relatively small treating these two terms as perturbations .",
    "however , in spite of a very good agreement with experimental nuclear masses , there remains an obstacle to the acceptance of such model .",
    "nuclear matter is believed to be uniformly distributed inside a nucleus whereas the solutions of the aforementioned models display shell - like configuration for the baryon and energy densities .",
    "part of this work is to demonstrate that it is possible to construct an effective lagrangian which leads to nonshell configuration and still preserves and even improves the agreement with nuclear mass data .",
    "we may write the general static solution as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the unit vector @xmath42 let us consider the model in ( [ model0to6 ] ) in the limit where @xmath16 and @xmath19 are small .",
    "for that purpose , we introduce the axial solutions for the @xmath43 case@xmath44 @xmath45 where @xmath46 is an integer .",

    "@xmath2 in ( [ gdeu ] ) is a key ingredient in the determination of the solution here .",

    "note that @xmath63 diverges as @xmath64 and vanishes at @xmath65 . since this solution saturates the bogomolnyi bound , the static energy is proportional to the baryon number @xmath66 .",
    "a more general choice was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath67 \\label{ck}\\ ] ] this form allows one to recover the chiral symmetry breaking pion mass term @xmath68  in the limit of small pion field fluctuations @xmath69 and  to find a relation between the pion mass @xmath70 and the parameter @xmath15 @xmath71 the case considered in ref .",
    "@xcite is a particular example of such potential with@xmath72 and @xmath73 assuming the axial solution ( [ axialsolution ] ) , the potential simplifies to @xmath74 and upon integration ( [ gdeu ] ) , we get the solution @xmath75 with @xmath62 . here , we use the absolute value in order to eliminate of the sign ambiguity of the arccos function . in order to set the baryon number to @xmath76 and the integration constant @xmath77 we fix the boundary conditions @xmath78 and @xmath79 for positive and negative baryon number respectively .",
    "note that the exponential fall off of @xmath58 at large @xmath80 helps prevent some quantities such as the moments of inertia from becoming infinite .",
    "unfortunately , the bps - type models in refs . @xcite and @xcite both lead to shell configurations for the baryon and energy densities which disagrees with experimental results .",
    "this is often the case for skyrme models and it is clear from expressions ( [ estat ] ) and ( [ bint ] ) that this behavior can be traced back to the form of the profile @xmath81 or more precisely to the derivative @xmath82 which tends to zero near @xmath65 for such models .    let us consider the more appropriate solution of the form @xmath83 with @xmath84 and similar boundary conditions @xmath78 and @xmath79  here , since @xmath85 @xmath86 neither the baryon density @xmath87 nor the static energy density vanishes near @xmath65 .",
    "we find by inspection of ( [ gdeu ] ) , that this solution emerges from a potential similar to ( [ vr3 ] ) , namely @xmath88 the logarithmic dependence in the denominator of this expression could be problematic since @xmath89 at @xmath65 and @xmath90  at @xmath91 but the limits for @xmath2 are well defined and finite , i.e. @xmath92 respectively .",
    "it is interesting to note that according to ( [ equipartition ] ) , the square root of the potential@xmath93 corresponds to the baryon radial density ( the term in parenthesis ) up to a multiplicative constant .",
    "thus , in order to obtain a nonshell baryon density , it suffices to construct a potential @xmath2 that does not vanish at small @xmath94 such a potential would also imply that @xmath95  our choice of potential clearly verifies this requirement but this relation also explains why the earlier bps - type models could not generate a nonshell configuration , namely @xmath96 and @xmath97 in that limit .",
    "the expression ( [ vr2 ] ) only applies to the axial solution ( [ axialsolution ] ) and we need to write a more general form for @xmath2 in terms of @xmath98 if this is to be used in the expression for the lagrangian .",
    "a simple but not unique approach to construct the potential is to identify @xmath99 to the expression @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the identity matrix .",
    "then , a convenient expression for @xmath2 is given by @xmath102 \\nonumber\\ ] ] comparing this expression to ( [ ck ] ) allows retrieving each coefficient@xmath103 such that @xmath104    inserting expression ( [ bhmsoln ] ) in ( [ estat ] ) , we get the static energy of the soliton in the small @xmath16 and @xmath19 approximation@xmath105    with@xmath106 where @xmath62 sets the scale of the solution and @xmath107 is the riemann @xmath108 function .",
    "the terms @xmath2 and @xmath109 are proportional to the baryon number @xmath66 as one expects from solutions that saturate the bogomolnyi bound whereas the small perturbations @xmath110 and @xmath111 have a more complex dependence .",
    "part of this behavior , the overall factor @xmath112 is due to the scaling .",
    "the additional factor of @xmath113 comes from the axial symmetry of the solution ( [ axialsolution ] ) .",
    "note that it is also easy to calculate analytically the root mean square radius of the baryon density @xmath114 which is consistent with experimental observation for the charge distribution of nuclei @xmath115 .    in order to represent physical nuclei ,",
    "we have taken into account their rotational and isorotational degrees of freedom and quantize the solitons .",
    "the standard procedure is to use the semiclassical quantization which is described in the next section .",
    "skyrmions are not pointlike particles .",
    "so we resort to a semiclassical quantization method which consists in adding an explicit time dependence to the zero modes of the skyrmions and applying a time - dependent ( iso)rotations on the skyrme fields by @xmath12 matrix @xmath116 and @xmath117 @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the associated @xmath120 rotation matrix .",
    "the approach assumes that the skyrmion behave as a rigid rotator . upon insertion of this ansatz in the time - dependent part of the full lagrangian ( [ model0to6 ] ) , we can write the ( iso)rotational lagrangian as @xmath121 where @xmath122tr@xmath123 and @xmath124tr@xmath125    the moment of inertia tensors @xmath126 is given by@xmath127   \\left [   l_{p},t_{j}\\right ]   \\right ) \\nonumber\\\\ &   + \\left .",

    "we consider two additional contributions to the mass , the coulomb energy associated with the charge distribution inside the skyrmion and an isospin breaking term  that may be attributed to the up and down quark mass difference .",

    ". the higher baryon number configurations of the original skyrme model are nontrivial ( toroidal shape for @xmath193 , tetrahedral for @xmath194 , etc . ) and finding them exactly either requires heavy numerical calculations ( see for example @xcite ) or some kind of clever approximation like rational maps @xcite .",
    "moreover , the computation of the coulomb energy is more challenging in general since it involves two integrations over volume .",
    "one can also argue that the coulomb energy of skyrmions is somewhat reduced by shell - like configurations of the charge densities as opposed to what it would be for a nearly constant spherical density found in electron scattering experiments . in our case however , we are interested in a more precise calculation of the nuclei masses and an estimate of the coulomb energy is desirable , and even more so in our model which generates nonshell configurations .",
    "it turns out that the analytical form of the chiral angle @xmath81 in ( [ bhmsoln ] ) and the axial symmetry of the solution simplify the computation of the coulomb energy .",

    "negligibly small , the energy density should be dominated by the potential term @xmath294 .",
    "if we consider the integrated energy density subject to the condition that the total baryon number @xmath5 is a positive integer , then we expect the energy to be bounded from below for our set of parameters .    clearly for our axial solution",

    "the properties of the soliton are almost completely determined by the values of @xmath239 and @xmath18 so @xmath38 and @xmath70 may not be so closely related to the nucleon mass scale as for the original skyrme model .",
    "perhaps the explanation for such a departure is that the parameters of the model are merely bare parameters and they could differ significantly from their renormalized physical values . in other words , we may have to consider two quite different sets of parameters : a first one , relevant to the perturbative regime for pion physics where @xmath38 and @xmath70 are close to their experimental value and a second one , that applies to the nonperturbative regime in the case of soliton .",
    "unfortunately , one of the successes of the original skyrme model is that it established a link between pion physics with realistic values for @xmath38 and @xmath70 and baryon masses .",
    "such a link here is more obscure .    on the other hand , the model in ( [ model0to6 ] ) ( in the regime where @xmath16 and @xmath19 are small ) improves the prediction with regard to the properties of the nuclei of nuclear masses .",

    ". set  i is the least accurate when it comes to reproducing the experimental data , especially in the heavy nuclei sector .",
    "yet , the agreement remains within a @xmath251 of the experimental masses which is much better than with the original skyrme model .",
    "moreover , since the ratio @xmath3 depends on the difference between the mass of a nucleus and that of its constituents , it is sensitive to small variation of the nuclear masses so the results for @xmath3 may be considered as rather good .",
    "the second fit ( set  ii ) , which is optimized for nuclear masses , overestimates the binding energies of the lightest nuclei while it reproduces almost exactly the remaining experimental values ( @xmath295 .",
    "finally , the least square fit based on @xmath3 ( set  iii ) is the best fit overall but in order to provide a better representation for light nuclei , it abdicates some of the accuracy found in set  ii for @xmath296 .",
    "this apparent dichotomy between light and heavy nuclei may be partly attributed to the ( iso)rotational contribution to the mass .",
    "the size of nuclei grows as @xmath6 and their moments of inertia increase accordingly .",
    "also , the spin of the most abundant isotopes remains small while isospin can have relatively large values due to the growing disequilibrium between the number of proton and the number of neutron in heavy nuclei .",
    "our numerical calculations reveal that the total effect leads to a ( iso)rotational energy @xmath297 1 mev for @xmath298 for all sets of parameters considered and its contribution to @xmath3 decreases rapidly as @xmath5 increases . on the contrary for @xmath299",
    "the rotational energy is responsible for a larger part of the binding energy which means that @xmath3  should be sensitive to the way the rotational energy is computed .",

    "it turns out that both models are equally successful at reproducing data .",
    "minimizing the square root of the mean squared deviation of @xmath3 from its experimental value gives almost identical results for both models , @xmath305 mev per nucleon , despite generating completely different baryon and energy configurations .",
    "in fact , the absence of a variation in @xmath1 signals somehow the equal inability for both models to provide an accurate description of light and heavy nuclei sectors at the same time . one could improve the agreement by fitting separately the parameters @xmath238 and @xmath18 in the two sectors @xmath306 and @xmath307 but this would means introducing an arbitrary baryon number dependence on the parameter which could only be justified by introducing some kind of dynamical effect on @xmath308 and @xmath235    the second motivation for this work regards this addition of the coulomb and isospin breaking effect into the nuclear masses .",
    "these are often neglected in the context of the skyrme model although they must inevitably be taken into account for a complete description of the nucleus .",
    "the coulomb energy and isospin breaking term represent small corrections to the nuclear mass ( of the order of @xmath309 and @xmath310 respectively ) however our results show that the coulomb effect is much more significant in the calculation of the binding energy . the change in @xmath3",

    ", we allowed for near - bps solitons with nonshell configurations for the baryon density in order to achieve a more realistic description of nuclei as opposed to the more complex configurations found in most extensions of the skyrme model ( e.g. @xmath193 toroidal , @xmath194 tetrahedral , @xmath316 cubic , ... ) .",
    "moreover , we introduced additional contributions to the mass of the nuclei coming from the coulomb energy and an isospin breaking term .",
    "fitting the model parameters , we find a remarkable agreement for the binding energy per nucleon @xmath3 with respect to experimental data .",
    "these results suggest that nuclei could be considered as near - bps skyrmions .",

    "first , the skyrme model provides a simultaneous description for perturbative pion interactions and nonperturbative baryons physics with single realistic values for @xmath38 and @xmath70 and baryon masses .",
    "the connection between the two sectors here seems to be much more intricate .",
    "also , a much better agreement could be reached if one could construct a solution that would describe equally well the light and heavy nuclei .",
