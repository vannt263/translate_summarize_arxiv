    "in a few years the third generation of gravitational wave detectors will start searching for the most energetic events in the universe caused by gravitational collapse and merging of relativistic compact massive objects ( see the review by thorne 1997 ) .",
    "this opens a new window onto the universe and creates new connections between optical extragalactic astronomy and gravitational wave astronomy .",
    "this will be the beginning of genuine observational study of the physics of the core collapse supernova explosions and testing relativistic and even quantum gravity theories ( damour 1999 ; gasperini 1999 ) .",
    "expected sources of powerful gravitational wave ( hereafter , gw ) events are connected with supernova explosions and merging of neutron stars and other relativistic compact massive objects in galaxies . predicted gw signals essentially depend on the details of the last relativistic stages of the gravitational collapse which is still poorly known ( thorne 1987;1997 ; paczyncki 1999 ; burrows 2000 ) .",
    "moreover studies of scalar - tensor gravity theories have shown that spherical gravitational collapse and binary systems generate scalar gws which may be detected by existing gw detectors ( baryshev 1982 ; 1995 ; 1997 ; baryshev & sokolov 1984 ; sokolov 1992 ; damour & esposito - fareze 1992 ; 1996 ; 1998 ; shibata et al .",

    "the aim of this paper is to estimate the contribution of nearby galaxies and clusters of galaxies , within a radius of about @xmath3 around our galaxy , to the detection of the possible gw events .",
    "this requires the knowledge of the actual 3-dimensional galaxy distribution ( section 2 ) , the intrinsic rate of the most powerful events expected from different galaxy types ( section 3 ) , and the amplitude of the gw signal according to the prediction of existing scenarios of sn core collapses ( section 4 ) . in section 5 we calculate the probability of gw events as a function of sidereal time for currently operating bar detectors and forthcoming interferometric detectors . in this section we first study the amplitude expected for",
    "the virgo cluster and the great attractor and then derive the density of probability of gw events as a function of the sidereal time for some detectors .",
    "a discussion of the results and the main conclusions are given in section 6 .",
    "explosions of supernovae and mergings of binary massive compact objects are very rare in our galaxy .",
    "hence , only observations of many galaxies are expected to yield a reasonable detection rate .    from the lyon - meudon extragalactic database leda we extracted a sample of 33557 nearby galaxies within 100 mpc .",
    "the 2d - distribution is shown on a flamsteed equal area projection ( fig .",
    "[ flam ] ) .",
    "some prominent structures appear .",
    "what are their distances ? what is the actual space density of galaxies ?",
    "the direct determination of distance requires difficult measurements and is thus available only for relatively small samples ( 5000 galaxies ) .",
    "the most efficient method consists of using the radial velocity together with a given hubble constant . however , the determination of the hubble constant is still controversial .",
    "most of the difficulties come from the treatment of statistical biases . from the most recent absolute calibration and the best unbiased determination we adopt : @xmath4    nevertheless , we must consider that some results are still suggestive of a larger value ( @xmath5 ) , and even @xmath6 can not be excluded . the smaller the value , the more difficult is gw detection due to larger distances to gw sources .      analysis of the 3d - galaxy distribution from the correlation function method ( davis & peebles,1983 ; davis,1997 ) leads to the conclusion that the characteristic correlation length is @xmath7 and the maximum inhomogeneity scale @xmath8 .",
    "however , a more general statistical method to study large - scale galaxy distribution has been recently developed ( see the review by sylos labini , montuori , & pietronero , 1998 ) .",
    "it is applicable to any distribution of matter without the assumption of homogeneity ( which is required in the correlation function analysis ) .",
    "the new analysis ( the so - called conditional density function approach ) is actually taken from modern statistical physics where it works as a standard tool .",
    "application of the conditional density function analysis to available redshift surveys of galaxies , such as cfa , ssrs , perseus- pisces , iras , lcrs etc , has revealed the fractal structure of the galaxy distribution up to the scales corresponding to the depth of these catalogs , i.e. about 100 mpc ( see e.g. pietronero et al.,1997 ; sylos labini et al.,1998 ) .",
    "the fractal dimension of the spatial distribution is close to @xmath9 . from the klun galaxy survey ( teerikorpi et al . , 1998 ) where distances to galaxies are obtained by the tully - fisher method , it was shown that the observed number - distance relationship corresponds to a fractal dimension @xmath10 and continues up to the depth of the klun catalog , i.e. 200 mpc .",
    "the fractality implies that around any galaxy ( including our own galaxy ) the density decreases as @xmath11 .",
    "this means that the number of galaxies does not increase as @xmath12 but rather as @xmath13 .",
    "the direct consequence for the present analysis is that the detection rate of gw events will be lower than previously thought .",
    "from our sample we plotted the cumulative curves @xmath14 vs. @xmath15 ( n is the total number of observed galaxies ) within the radius @xmath16 ( mpc ) ( fig .",
    "[ complv ] ) .",
    "this is done for different absolute magnitudes .",
    "intrinsically faint galaxies ( @xmath17 ) start to be missed beyond @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , while galaxies brighter than @xmath20 are observed up to the limit of our sample ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the observed growth - curves correspond to @xmath22 ( dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ complv ] ) .",
    "they are used to calculate the correction allowing us to estimate the true number of galaxies in each direction , from the observed number . at a given distance , this correcting factor",
    "is simply deduced from the ratio of the observed and expected population ( assuming @xmath22 ) .",
    "it is to be noted that up to @xmath23 , even the faintest galaxies ( @xmath17 ) follow the linear curve .",
    "this means that the sample is complete up to this distance ( 20 mpc ) .",
    "there are many sources of gravitational radiation in a galaxy .",
    "in fact , any accelerated motion generates gw . among those usually discussed in the literature ,",
    "galactic sources of gw are : supernova explosions , coalescing binary systems , binary stars , rotating asymmetric pulsars , active galactic nuclei .",
    "we consider only the gw sources which are expected to be sufficiently frequent and efficient to be detected in the near future .",
    "the most powerful sources of gravitational radiation are the core - collapse supernovae ( types ib and ii ) , merging neutron stars ( ns ) , and black holes or other relativistic compact massive objects ( cmo ) ( thorne 1987 ; 1997 ) ) and also supernovae of type ia , which are probably due to the explosion of a co white dwarf and might be sufficiently strong candidates .",
    "the relative supernova rates @xmath24 for galaxy type g and sn type s are free parameters in our code . for further calculations we adopt these from van den bergh & tammann(1991 ) , measured in snu which equals one event per 100 yr per @xmath25 . in table",
    "[ trh ] we give the adopted rates of sn events for different morphological types of galaxies .",
    "note that we use the hubble constant 60 @xmath26 .",
    "the event rate @xmath27 for coalescing compact binaries composed of ns ( or cmo ) is still widely discussed and has a large uncertainty ( e.g.lipunov et al .",
    "1997 ; portegies - zwart & mcmillan 1999 ; kalogera 1999 ) . here",
    "we adopt the values from lipunov et al.(1995 ) , however these events give a small contribution to the total statistics .",
    "the first detailed study of the gravitational wave sky produced by galaxies within 50 mpc was done by lipunov et al.(1995 ) .",
    "they considered a wide class of gw sources in galaxies and used tully s nearby galaxies catalog comprising 2367 galaxies . in this paper",
    "we use 33557 galaxies from the leda catalogue and consider both tensor and scalar gw from supernova explosions .",
    ".adopted intrinsic rate of gw events .",
    "we consider supernovae explosions ( snia , snib , snii ) and coalescences of white dwarfs ( wd ) , neutron stars ( ns ) , and black holes or compact massive objects ( cmo ) .",
    "the rate may depend on the morphological type of the parent galaxy ( elliptical(e ) , spirals(s ) or irregulars(irr ) ) .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^ , > , > \" , ]     in the following subsections we calculate the amplitudes in different conditions , for different detectors and sources . for the study of the polarization effect on tensor waves ( fig.[amplitii ] to [ amplitia ] ) we used the cluster virgo ( as a point source ) and detectors virgo and auriga . for the comparison of the distribution of the amplitudes of virgo and of the great - attractor ( fig .",
    "[ amplitim ] to [ amplisb2 m ] ) we used virgo and the great attractor as point sources and the detectors virgo , auriga and nautilus . for the calculation of the density of probability of gw events along the sideral time ( fig .",
    "[ count_a ] and [ count_c ] ) we used the sample of individual galaxies and the detectors virgo , auriga and nautilus .      because the polarization angle can not be predicted ,",
    "it is important to show the effect of the polarization for tensor waves . considering only the virgo cluster and interferometric ( virgo ) and bar detector ( auriga ) , we calculated the amplitude according to eq .",
    "[ eq13 ] using @xmath28 for case b ( fig.[sens_dist ] ) .",
    "the geometrical factor is given by eq .",
    "[ relti ] and [ reltb ] , for an interferometric and bar detector respectively .",
    "we used 36 polarization angles over the range @xmath29 . for interferometric detectors and @xmath30 for bar detectors ] the results",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ amplitii]a - b , respectively .    for interferometric detectors ,",
    "the different curves are shifted along the x - axis ( sidereal time ) depending on the polarization . on the contrary , for bar detectors ,",
    "the curves are shifted along the y - axis ( amplitude ) , but the minima and maxima always appear at the same x values ( same sidereal times ) .",
    "let us explain why it is not correct to calculate the mean over the different polarizations . if an event is produced with the favorable polarization , it will be detected if the amplitude is larger than the limiting amplitude . on the other hand ,",
    "if the polarization is unfavorable , the observed amplitude will be reduced and the considered event may fall below the limiting amplitude .",
    "the global effect of the uncertainty on the polarization is simply a reduction of the number of counted events , but not a reduction of the amplitude .",
    "finally , the distribution of the amplitudes along the sidereal time will be simply given by the envelope of the curves obtained for the different polarizations .",
    "it must be noted that it is a handicap for interferometric detectors because the contrast is smoothed and the total number of expected events is reduced .",
    "we repeated the same calculations with polarizations taken at random ( fig .",
    "[ amplitia]a - b ) .",
    "the same effect is clearly visible .",
    "the curves are the envelopes of the previous ones .",
    "some events are seen with smaller amplitudes due to unfavorable polarization .",
    "we have calculated the gw amplitudes as a function of sidereal time for the four detectors listed in the previous table . for each of them",
    "we give two figures , for tensor and scalar gw , respectively . in each figure",
    "we present the amplitudes expected for sources in the virgo cluster ( solid curve ) and in the great attractor region ( dashed curve ) .",
    "the results are given in four figures ( fig .",
    "[ amplitim ] to [ amplisb2 m ] ) : the caption of each figure contains detailed comments . here , we will simply highlight prominent features .    with a sensitivity @xmath31 only gw events from the virgo cluster ( solid lines )",
    "will be detectable .",
    "the great attractor ( dashed curves ) will be detectable only with a sensitivity of @xmath32 .",
    "nevertheless , there is one case ( virgo detector - fig.[amplitim]b ) where scalar waves could be seen from the great attractor with a sensitivity of @xmath31 .",
    "because we expect about 25 times more events from the great attractor , this may result in a peak in the rate of events around sidereal time @xmath33 .",
    "another important features in these diagrams of amplitudes is that tensor and scalar waves give peaks which generally have opposite phases . in other words , if we expect a maximum of events for scalar waves , there should be a minimum for tensor waves .",
    "this is clearly visible by comparing fig.[amplitb1 m ] a and b. this is also important because it may be used to disentangle the contributions of these two kinds of waves .",
    "the same characteristic is present when we compare the expected counts for the nautilus bar detector with two perpendicular orientations ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) .",
    "the figure suggests that nautilus could benefit from an orientation complementary to the one used , e.g. , with the auriga orientation .      using the catalog of galaxies described in section 2 , we simulated the count of gw events using eq .",
    "[ proba ] .",
    "the calculation is made with an energy of @xmath36 , a frequency of @xmath37 and a duration of @xmath38 .",
    "this corresponds to the case b of fig.[sens_dist ] . the adopted limiting amplitude @xmath39 is @xmath40 .",
    "it should allow us to reach the virgo cluster .",
    "the calculation is done for virgo , auriga , nautilus ( azimuth=@xmath41 ) and nautilus ( azimuth=@xmath42 ) .",
    "we plotted simultaneously the counts for tensor ( solid curves ) and scalar waves ( dashed curves ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[count_a ] and [ count_c ] for the four considered detectors .",
    "when comparing these figures with the expected amplitudes calculated for the detectors virgo and auriga , it is seen that all predicted maxima are at the expected positions according to the distribution of amplitudes given by the virgo cluster alone ( solid curves in fig .",
    "[ amplitim]a and b and [ amplitb1m]a and b ) .",
    "this confirms that , within a distance of 20 mpc , the virgo cluster dominates .",
    "this was not obvious because the influence of other galaxies was not easy to predict .",
    "the expected number of gw events reaches a few tens per year at the most favorable sidereal time but with a yet unreachable sensitivity for the considered gw energy . for instance , from fig.[count_a]-a we see that several maxima are expected for scalar waves ( dotted curve ) in agreement with their positions predicted from fig.[amplitim]-b for the virgo cluster alone .",
    "similarly , the maximum at @xmath43 for tensor waves ( solid curve ) is the one predicted for virgo alone as seen from fig.[amplitim]-a .",
    "this confirms that the virgo cluster will be the dominant source of gw events when the sensitivity will be @xmath31 .    from fig.[count_a]-b ( auriga bar detector )",
    "one can see clearly that tensor waves and scalar waves have opposite phases as far as the sidereal time is concerned .",
    "the same effect is also visible from fig.[count_c ] a and b with the nautilus bar detector .",
    "further , we see that changing the orientation of the bar by @xmath44 also produces a change of sidereal time phase ; the maximum in fig.[count_c]-b for , say , tensor waves ( solid curve ) , corresponds to a minimum in fig.[count_c]-a .",
    "from the detection of gw events with bar and interferometric detectors , one can see that , due to the different geometrical factors and to the anisotropy of the distribution of the gw sources , it is in principle possible to make the distinction between transversal tensor gw , transversal scalar gw and longitudinal scalar gw .    to demonstrate this difference we calculated the expected amplitudes and the number of events as a function of sidereal time for real positions of existing gw detectors and for real 3-dimensional distribution of galaxies within 100 mpc . if one adopts the value for the energy of gw pulse @xmath45 ( lines @xmath46 in fig.[sens_dist ] ) , then , gw events produced at the distance of the virgo cluster can be detected only with a sensitivity , yet unreachable , of @xmath47 .",
    "however if the gw energy is about @xmath48 ( case @xmath49 in fig.3 ) as predicted by nonaxisymmetric scenarios of sn core collapse , then virgo cluster and great attractor would be visible with @xmath50 .",
    "if the gw energy emission has value @xmath51 or less , as predicted by an axisymmetric scenario of sn explosion , then virgo would simply be not detectable with present and forthcoming detectors .",
    "thus , one can not expect a high detection rate , but only serendipitous detections from very nearby sn s .",
    "we would like to emphasize a point which seems important to us .",
    "today there are several scenarios of gw radiation from sn core collapse even in the frame of the general relativity , which predicts only tensor gravitational radiation ( see review by thorne,1997 ) . within different scenarios ,",
    "the sn core collapse may lead to a large range of radiated gw energy from @xmath52 up to @xmath53 and to very different forms of gw bursts , i.e. to the different spectral energy distributions and durations of gw pulses from msec up to sec and even minutes ( lai & shapiro , 1995 ) .",
    "it is important to recall that other relativistic and quantum gravity theories ( such as string theory , the jordan - fierz - brans - dicke theory and tensor field theory ) predict scalar gravitational radiation which is generated also in the case of a spherical gravitational collapse and which may carry a large gw energy",
    ".    we would like to emphasize the importance of considering a wide range of gw burst parameters for sn core collapses by discussing the sn1987a and sn1993j events .",
    "analysis of data recorded by geograv for sn1987a ( amaldi et al .",
    "1987 ) and by explorer - allegro for sn1993j ( mauceli et al . 1997 ) , showed that there are gw candidate events , which the authors themselves do not consider as real signals because the gw energy calculated for a standard pulse with a duration @xmath54 ( and hence bandwidth 1 khz ) gives @xmath55 for both supernovae .",
    "however , in the case of pulse duration of about 1 sec ( and hence bandwidth 1 hz ) the gw energy needed for producing the same gw amplitude is about @xmath56 . in this case",
    "the observed gw amplitudes correspond to the lines `` a '' in fig.3 and fit well the decrease expected from the relative distances of the two host galaxies ( lmc , m81 ) . with timescale a few seconds ( kulkarni et al . 1999 ; paczynski 1999 ) . ]",
    "this means that gw data analysis should be done for the interval of possible signal durations from ms to sec timescales . for the gw pulses longer than 1 sec the frequency bandwidth is less than 1 hz and the sensitivity of bar detectors may be essencially improved if one uses as a signal the difference between two signals coming from two resonances of a bar detector .    let us conclude with the most secure results presented in this paper :    * we wrote a computer code to calculate the amplitude of transversal or longitudinal gravitational waves from any real source which could be detected with bar or interferometer detectors .",
    "this code allows us to fix all experimental conditions : latitude and sideral time of the detector , type and orientation of the detector , right ascension and declination of the emitting source , characteristics of the gravitational wave .",
    "* this code has been used to calculate how the amplitude changes with sideral time of the site for existing detectors . in particular , using a point source we study the effect of the polarization of the wave in the case of tensor waves . *",
    "then , we compared the distribution of amplitudes along the sideral time for bar and interferometric detectors and for transversal and longitudinal gravitational waves for two dominant point sources .",
    "we found an interesting result for bar detectors ( nautilus ) which can have different orientations .",
    "this may be used for the selection of real gw signals from the noise .",
    "the result is that it would be theoretically possible to discriminate both kinds of waves because , for a considered point source , the maxima of the distributions do not appear at the same sideral time . * finally , we applied the code to calculate the expected count of events generated by the actual distribution of galaxies using the gravitational energy release predicted by existing scenarios of supernova core collapse .",
    "the result is that , with the sensitivity of gw detectors @xmath57 and for the released gw energy @xmath58 , predicted by nonaxisymmetric scenarios of sn core collapse supernova , it is possible to detect gw events from the distance of the virgo cluster and great attractor and to use the statistics of the events as a test of gravity theories .",
    "feynman s field gravity theory ( feynman et al.,1995 ) is based on the lagrangian formalism of the relativistic quantum field theory and presents a non - geometrical description of gravitational interaction . according to feynman ,",
    "the gravity force between two masses is caused by the exchange of gravitons which are mediators of the gravitational interaction and actually represent the quantum of the relativistic tensor field @xmath59 in minkowski space @xmath60 .",
    "it is important that the problem of the physical interaction of a gravitational wave with an detector may be completely analyzed in terms of the weak field approximation where classical relativistic field theory is applicable ( see landau & lifshitz , 1971 ) .",
    "first , let us consider the general problem of the motion of a relativistic test particle having rest - mass @xmath61 , 4-velocity @xmath62 , and 3-velocity @xmath63 in the gravitational field described by the symmetric tensor potential @xmath59 in the flat minkowski space - time .",
    "the cartesian coordinates always exist and the metric tensor is @xmath64 ( we utilize notations of the text - book landau & lifshitz , 1971 ) .    to derive the equation of motion for test particles in the frame of the field gravity theory we start from the stationary action principle in the form @xmath65 where the variation of the action is made with respect to the particle trajectories @xmath66 for fixed gravitational potential @xmath67 , and @xmath68 is the element of the 4-volume .",
    "the free particle lagrangian is @xmath69 and the interaction lagrangian is @xmath70 where the energy - momentum tensor of the test point particle is @xmath71 the result of variation gives the equations of motion in the form ( kalman 1961 ; baryshev 1986 ) : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is 4-momentum of the test particle , @xmath74 and @xmath75 @xmath76 in eq.([eq - motion ] ) the rest mass of the test particle may be canceled , hence in the field gravity theory @xmath77 without the initial equivalence postulate ( thirring 1961 ) . in agreement with eq.([eq - motion ] ) all classical relativistic post - newtonian gravity effects have the same values as in general relativity ( see e.g. baryshev 1995 ) .",
    "the scalar gravitational wave in the field gravity theory is generated by the trace of the energy momentum tensor @xmath78 of the sources of the gravitational potential ( baryshev 1982;1995 ; sokolov 1992 ) and may be expressed in the form : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the trace of the tensor potential @xmath59 and hence is a 4-scalar field in minkowski space .    substituting eq.([scalar ] ) in eq.([eq - motion ] ) and taking into account the weak field approximation we get the following equation of motion of the test particle in scalar gravitational potential : @xmath81    spatial components of this equation ( @xmath82 ) give the expression for the gravity force acting on the test particle : @xmath83 the corresponding 3-acceleration of the test particle is @xmath84 the time component ( @xmath85 ) of the eq.([weak_scalar_eq_motion ] ) gives the work produced by the scalar gravitational wave : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the kinetic energy of the particle . for the case of slow motion of the test particle ( @xmath88 ) we get for the gravity force : @xmath89 for 3-acceleration of the test particle : @xmath90 and for the work of the gravity force : @xmath91 the scalar plane monochromatic gw in the system of coordinates with the z - axis directed along the wave propagation may be written in the form : @xmath92 @xmath93      for the scalar gravitational potential eq.([scal ] ) the 3-acceleration eq.([weak_scalar_accel ] ) of the test particle is @xmath97 @xmath98 according to eq.([vz ] ) under the action of the scalar gravitational wave a test mass undergo small longitudinal oscillations in the direction of wave propagation ( z - axis ) : @xmath99 the relative distance between two particles @xmath100 gives the relative oscillations @xmath101 , which may be detected by gravitational detector .",
    "the very important property of the scalar gravitational potential is that it does not interact with the electromagnetic field .",
    "indeed , the interaction lagrangian for the potential eq.([scalar ] ) is @xmath102 because the trace of the energy momentum tensor of the electromagnetic field @xmath103 .",
    "this means that the above analysis is sufficient for the study of the response of the bar or interferometric detectors where the distances between test particles are measured by means of the electromagnetic field .    for a detector with the length @xmath104",
    "the amplitude of the relative displacement @xmath105 between two test particles , which is measured by the detector is @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the amplitude of the scalar wave eq.([scal ] ) , and @xmath108 is the angle between the direction of the wave propagation and the line connecting the two masses .",
    "for a bar detector the integral cross section for the scalar gravitational wave having @xmath109 is given by ( baryshev , 1997 ) : @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the mass of the cylinder , @xmath112 is the speed of sound in the cylinder , @xmath113 is resonance angular frequency of the bar , @xmath114 is the length of the cylinder and @xmath108 is the angle between the bar axis and the direction of the wave propagation .",

    "<S> we use data on the local 3-dimensional galaxy distribution for studying the statistics of the detection rates of gravitational waves ( gw ) coming from supernova explosions . </S>",
    "<S> we consider both tensor and scalar gravitational waves which are possible in a wide range of relativistic and quantum gravity theories . </S>",
    "<S> we show that statistics of gw events as a function of sidereal time can be used for distinction between scalar and tensor gravitational waves because of the anisotropy of spatial galaxy distribution .    for calculation of the expected amplitudes of gw signals we use the values of the released gw energy , frequency and duration of gw pulse which are consistent with existing scenarios of sn core collapse . the amplitudes of the signals produced by virgo and the great attractor clusters of galaxies </S>",
    "<S> is expressed as a function of the sidereal time for resonant bar detectors operating now ( igec ) and for forthcoming laser interferometric detectors ( virgo ) . </S>",
    "<S> then , we calculate the expected number of gw events as a function of sidereal time produced by all the galaxies within 100 mpc .    in the case of axisymmetric rotational core collapse which radiates a gw energy of @xmath0 , only the closest explosions can be detected . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the case of nonaxisymmetric supernova explosion , due to such phenomena as centrifugal hangup , bar and lump formation , the gw radiation could be as strong as that from a coalescing neutron - star binary . for radiated gw energy higher than @xmath1 and sensitivity of detectors at the level </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 it is possible to detect virgo cluster and great attractor , and hence to use the statistics of gw events for testing gravity theories . </S>"
