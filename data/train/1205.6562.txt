    "the space @xmath0 of linear differential operators on a smooth manifold @xmath1 has a rich geometric structure . by the _ geometry _ of @xmath0 ,",
    "we understand its structure as a module over the group of all diffeomorphisms of @xmath1 , and thereby also over its lie algebra , the space @xmath2 of smooth vector fields on @xmath1 .",
    "the most interesting geometric properties of @xmath0 are described by its invariants under the group of diffeomorphisms .",
    "additional structure on @xmath1 leads to a smaller group of diffeomorphisms , and therefore a richer set of invariants of @xmath0 .",
    "contact manifolds provide an important class of examples of geometric structures . in this paper",
    "we study the geometric properties of @xmath0 viewed as a module over the lie algebra @xmath3 of all contact vector fields on @xmath1 .",
    "this viewpoint fits into the general framework of _ heisenberg calculus _ , see @xcite , where the geometric structure is a codimension-1 distribution in @xmath4 .",
    "our first main result is the association of a contact vector field to an arbitrary second order linear differential operator in a contact - invariant manner .",
    "although we do not carry out the investigation here , this could provide a means to associate topological invariants to second order operators .",
    "we generalize the result to differential operators of arbitrary order , associating to each a certain _ tensor density _ on  @xmath1 .",
    "this tensor density is independent of the symbol of the operator and may be thought of as a partial `` subsymbol '' .    by a tensor density , we mean a section of a power of the determinant line bundle .",
    "in fact , we state our results in the more general context of the spaces @xmath5 of differential operators between such line bundles , rather than simply for differential operators on functions .",
    "an interesting feature is appearance of _ contact resonances _ , that is , of special powers of the determinant line bundle for which the geometric properties of differential operators are more complicated .",
    "these resonances were already observed in @xcite .",
    "let us mention that the usual case where @xmath6 is non - resonant .",
    "our second main result is the existence of a filtration refining the usual filtration given by the heisenberg calculus .",
    "recall that differential operators on a contact manifold have a _ contact order _ ,",
    "in which vector fields tangent to the distribution are of order  1 , and contact vector fields are of order  2 .",
    "we introduce a contact - invariant filtration on @xmath5 for which , roughly speaking , tangential vector fields have order  1 and contact vector fields have order  3 .",
    "however , this filtration is not compatible with composition .",
    "we prove its existence in the non - resonant case .",
    "we remark that there is also an invariant double filtration on the space of differential forms on  @xmath1 @xcite . in some ways",
    ", the situation for contact manifolds appears to be analogous to that for foliated manifolds .",
    "this may at first be surprising , as contact distributions are completely non - integrable , but such analogies have been observed before @xcite .",
    "although our results and their applications are essentially geometric , the proofs are algebraic .",
    "the considerations are local , so we may work in the euclidean case , replacing @xmath1 by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , we need only consider the lie algebra of polynomial contact vector fields on @xmath7 , which is the classical infinite dimensional cartan algebra @xmath9 ; see @xcite .",
    "our main theorems are proven using certain underlying structural results concerning the cohomology of @xmath9 with coefficients in spaces of s between refined symbol modules . these results in turn",
    "are obtained using a quantization map which is equivariant with respect to the projective subalgebra @xmath10 of @xmath9 , a maximal subalgebra isomorphic to @xmath11 .",
    "we prove the existence and uniqueness of this quantization map using the description of the s of @xmath10 given by the harish - chandra homomorphism .",
    "we also calculate the map explicitly .",
    "an @xmath10-module is said to have an  if the center @xmath12 of the  of @xmath10 acts on it by scalars .",
    "the  is then the resulting homomorphism from @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "if an @xmath10-module has a finite jordan - hlder composition series of modules with distinct s , then the module splits as the direct sum of its composition series modules .",
    "let us discuss at this point the role of s in other forms of quantization .",
    "casimir element _ is the best known and simplest element of @xmath12 .",
    "it turns out that for the contact projective quantization studied in this paper , it is not sufficient to consider the eigenvalues of the casimir element alone , because there are fine symbol modules with distinct s but identical casimir eigenvalues .",
    "this is in contrast with the situation for projective quantization with respect to the full vector field lie algebra @xmath14 , whose projective subalgebra is @xmath15 .",
    "the full principal symbol modules have s under the action of @xmath15 , and these s are distinct  their casimir eigenvalues are different @xcite . therefore in this setting",
    "there is no need to consider s.    for conformal quantization , one replaces the projective subalgebra with the conformal subalgebra @xmath16 , a maximal subalgebra of @xmath17 . as was first observed in @xcite , in this",
    "setting the casimir element of @xmath16 is not sufficient to detect distinct s among these submodules .",
    "complete results concerning the existence and uniqueness of conformal quantization for s between s have recently been obtained in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to determine to what extent s can be used to replicate them .    the crucial property that allows us to apply algebraic results in the geometric situation of an arbitrary contact manifold @xmath1 is the _ uniqueness _ of the @xmath11-equivariant quantization map .",
    "for example , the subsymbol is first defined locally in darboux coordinates .",
    "its uniqueness then implies that it is defined globally on @xmath1 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ results ]",
    "we define the modules of tensor densities , s , and symbols , and formulate our main results . in section  [ k ]",
    "we fix local darboux coordinates and review local properties of the contact lie algebra . in section  [ s ]",
    "we study the modules of section  [ results ] under the action of the projective subalgebra , using s to compute contact resonances . in section  [ pq ]",
    "we prove the existence and uniqueness of the projective quantization , the natural projective equivalence from symbols to s. section  [ crcs ] contains the proofs of two of our main results : the existence and uniqueness of the subsymbol and of the fine filtration .",
    "section  [ t ] gives the explicit formula for the projective quantization and the subsymbol and proves our third main result .",
    "fix @xmath18 odd , and let @xmath1 be a smooth @xmath19-dimensional manifold equipped with a contact distribution @xmath20 : a completely non - integrable distribution of codimension  1 . as usual , locally we define the contact structure in terms of a contact form @xmath21 whose kernel is @xmath20 .",
    "the non - integrability of @xmath20 is equivalent to the fact that @xmath22 is a local volume form .",

    "the space of _ principal symbols _ of degree @xmath56 is the quotient @xmath57 it is well - known that its @xmath58-module structure depends only on  @xmath53 .",

    "the adjoint action of the lie algebra @xmath32 of contact s on itself is equivalent to @xmath62 . in other words",
    ", there is a @xmath3-equivalence @xmath63 associating a contact vector field @xmath64 to each element @xmath65 of @xmath62 . the tensor density @xmath65 is called the _ contact hamiltonian _ of @xmath64 .",
    "the notion of the contact hamiltonian is independent of the choice of a contact form @xmath21 .",

    "in fact , the second statement follows from  ( [ lxalpha ] ) , and the first follows from lemma  [ lagrange ] below .",

    "let us stress the fact that differential operators between tensor densities appear naturally in many geometric situations .",
