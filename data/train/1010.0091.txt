    "the standard cosmological model is based on the so - called copernican principle that we are not located in a special position in the universe .",
    "this model can naturally explain almost all observational data , and consequently seems to imply that the copernican principle is a reality . however , we should not blindly rely on this principle without observational justifications .",
    "the highly isotropic cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) implies the isotropy of our universe at our position .",
    "then , if we assume that the copernican principle is correct , we necessarily arrive at the conclusion that our universe is isotropic at every position , or equivalently , our universe is homogeneous and isotropic . by virtue of the homogeneity and isotropy ,",
    "the standard cosmological model is determined by several parameters called the cosmological parameters . in order to determine the cosmological parameters ,",
    "observational data are interpreted under the assumption of a homogeneous and isotropic universe on average . here",
    ", we should note that it is not clear at all how large the systematic errors would be in the determination of the cosmological parameters , if the copernican principle is abandoned .",
    "thus , it is an unavoidable task in observational cosmology to investigate possible `` anti - copernican '' universe models and test if such models can be observationally excluded .",
    "almost all anti - copernican universe models are based on the lematre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) solution which describes the dynamics of a spherically symmetric dust . in anti - copernican universe models ,",
    "an observer like us is usually assumed to be located in the neighborhood of the symmetry center  @xcite . in recent years",
    ", such models have attracted much attention , since some ltb universe models can recover the observed distance - redshift relation without introducing dark energy  @xcite , and various ways to observationally test these models have been proposed by many authors  @xcite .    as shown by previous studies",
    ", the ltb solution can explain various observational data besides the distance - redshift relation without the need to introduce dark energy .",
    "this is because this solution has functional degrees of freedom with respect to the comoving radial coordinate . in order to check the ltb universe models observationally ,",
    "it is crucial to find observable quantities which can reveal differences between the ltb universe models and copernican universe models with the dark energy .",
    "one such quantity is believed to be the redshift drift , i.e. , the time derivative of the cosmological redshift  @xcite . in the case of the @xmath1cdm model , which is the most likely copernican model at present ,",
    "the redshift drift is positive in the redshift domain @xmath2 , since the cosmological constant @xmath1 causes repulsive gravity .",
    "by contrast , there is no exotic matter with the violation of the strong energy condition in the ltb solution .",
    "thus , as long as there is no highly inhomogeneous structure , the redshift drift might be negative in ltb universe models .",
    "although several authors have pointed out the importance of the redshift drift  @xcite , there has been no detailed study of its general behavior in ltb universe models .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to investigate it .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ltb ] , we briefly review the ltb solution . in sec .",
    "[ sec : basiceq ] , we derive the equation for the redshift drift and show the behaviour of the redshift drift near an observer located at the symmetry center in ltb universe models . in sec .  [",
    "sec : negative ] , we define ltb void models and prove a theorem on the redshift drift in these models . in sec .",
    "[ sec : positive ] , we show that the redshift drift can be positive even in an ltb universe model , if an extremely large hump - type mass density distribution exists .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] is devoted to the summary and discussion .    in this paper",
    ", we denote the speed of light and newton s gravitational constant by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we consider a spherically symmetric inhomogeneous universe filled with dust .",
    "this universe is described by an exact solution of the einstein equations , which is known as the lematre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) solution .",
    "the metric of the ltb solution is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an arbitrary function of the radial coordinate @xmath7 .",
    "the matter is dust whose stress - energy tensor is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the mass density , and @xmath10 is the four - velocity of the fluid element .",
    "the coordinate system in eq .",
    "( [ eq : metric ] ) is chosen in such a way that @xmath11 .",
    "the circumferential radius @xmath12 is determined by one of the einstein equations , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is an arbitrary function related to the mass density @xmath15 by @xmath16 @xmath14 is known as the misner - sharp mass that is the quasi - local mass naturally introduced into the spherically symmetric spacetime@xcite . here",
    ", it should be noted that the misner - sharp mass is not necessarily a non - decreasing function of the comoving radial coordinate @xmath7 , even if the mass density @xmath15 is non - negative . in the case",
    "that a hypersurface labeled by @xmath17 is a homogeneous and isotropic space with positive curvature , @xmath7 can be chosen so that the circumferential radius is given by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a positive function of time ( in this case , @xmath20 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath21 is positive for @xmath22 , whereas it is negative @xmath23 .",
    "since @xmath15 is spatially constant by assumption , the derivative of the misner - sharp mass @xmath24 is positive for @xmath22 , whereas it is negative for @xmath23 .",
    "however , in this paper , we assume that the misner - sharp mass is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath7 in the domain of interest .",
    "this assumption is equivalent to the one that @xmath25 is positive if @xmath15 is positive .    following ref .",
    "@xcite , we write the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : einstein - eq ] ) in the form , @xmath26^{2/3 } s(x ) ,   \\label{eq : ys}\\\\ x&=&c^2kr^2\\left(\\frac{t - t_{\\rm b}}{6gm}\\right)^{2/3 } , \\label{eq : defx}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is an arbitrary function which determines the big bang time , and @xmath28 is a function defined implicitly as @xmath29 the function @xmath28 is analytic for @xmath30 .",
    "some characteristics of the function @xmath28 are given in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "as shown in the above , the ltb solution has three arbitrary functions , @xmath6 , @xmath14 and @xmath27 .",
    "one of them is a gauge degree of freedom for the rescaling of @xmath7 . in this paper , since @xmath31 is assumed to be a monotonically increasing function of @xmath7 , we can fix this freedom by setting @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the mass density at the symmetry center at the present time @xmath34 , i.e. , @xmath35 . by this choice",
    ", we have @xmath36 as in the case of the homogeneous and isotropic universe , the present hubble parameter @xmath37 is related to @xmath33 as @xmath38",
    "in order to study the cosmological redshift and the redshift drift , we consider ingoing radial null geodesics .",
    "the cosmological redshift @xmath39 of a light ray from a comoving source at @xmath7 to the observer at the symmetry center @xmath40 is defined by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the time component of the null geodesic tangent , and @xmath43 is the affine parameter which can be regarded as a function of @xmath7 . from the geodesic equations , we have the equation for the redshift @xmath39 as @xmath44 the null condition leads to @xmath45    we denote the trajectories of light rays observed by the central observer at @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively , by @xmath48 and @xmath49 here , by their definitions , we have @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 . substituting eq .   into eqs .   and , and regarding @xmath54 and @xmath55 as infinitesimal quantities , we obtain @xmath56 where we have used the fact that satisfies eqs .   and , and the arguments of @xmath57 and @xmath58 are @xmath59 and @xmath7 .",

    "<S> we study the redshift drift , i.e. , the time derivative of the cosmological redshift in the lematre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) solution in which the observer is assumed to be located at the symmetry center . </S>",
    "<S> this solution has often been studied as an anti - copernican universe model to explain the acceleration of cosmic volume expansion without introducing the concept of dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> one of decisive differences between ltb universe models and copernican universe models with dark energy is believed to be the redshift drift . </S>",
    "<S> the redshift drift is negative in all known ltb universe models , whereas it is positive in the redshift domain @xmath0 in copernican models with dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> however , there have been no detailed studies on this subject . in the present paper , we prove that the redshift drift of an off - center source is always negative in the case of ltb void models . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the redshift drift can be positive with an extremely large hump - type inhomogeneity . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that we can determine whether we live near the center of a large void without dark energy by observing the redshift drift . </S>"
