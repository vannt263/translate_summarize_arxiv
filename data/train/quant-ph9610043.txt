    "information is classically measured in units of bits , which are deterministic two - state systems that are said to exist either as logical zero , @xmath7 or logical one @xmath8 .",
    "however , such a representation is only an approximation of reality , which is described at small size scales by the laws of quantum physics .",
    "quantum - mechanical two - state systems ( `` qubits '' ) differ from the classical bit in that they may exist in a superposition of the two states , for example as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are arbitrary complex coefficients which satisfy @xmath12 .",
    "two continuous real parameters are needed to describe the state of a qubit , and in this sense , more information is somehow carried in it than by a classical bit .",
    "furthermore , qubits may not be cloned@xcite , and even more importantly , they may exist in _ entangled states _ where , for example , two qubits only carry one qubit of _ quantum information_.    unfortunately , quantum information is ( partially ) lost whenever a quantum system is observed ( whether deliberately or inadvertently ) .",
    "this _ decoherence _ process plays a role analogous to noise in a classical communication channel .",
    "a major advance in quantum information theory has been the discovery that quantum information can be redundantly encoded in such a manner that it may be efficiently transmitted with arbitrarily high fidelity through a decohering quantum channel .",
    "the _ quantum error correction codes_@xcite which make this possible are analogous to classical codes for binary memoryless channels . corresponding codes for classical linear codes and reed - muller codes have been found@xcite .",
    "these quantum coding schemes are based on a model for the decoherence of qubits , in which three kinds of errors can occur : bit flips ( @xmath13 ) , phase flips ( @xmath14 ) , and both simultaneously .",
    "this model is general ; it describes all possible decoherence mechanisms for a qubit .",
    "however , in a given physical system , the dominant decoherence process is of a specific nature which may admit a simpler description .",
    "for example , in phase damping , no bit flips occur .",
    "the question therefore arises : given a particular decoherence process , what is the optimal quantum error correction scheme ?",
    "we do not yet know how to handle this general problem .",
    "however in this paper , we report on progress towards a solution , by demonstrating a new class of quantum error correction codes which correct only one particular decoherence process known as amplitude damping .",
    "our approach is similar in philosophy to that of @xcite , but in contrast to that and other previous schemes , instead of qubits , which live in a two - dimensional hilbert space , we utilize bosonic systems which occupy the hilbert space @xmath15 amplitude damping model -----------------------    noise is a fundamental process which accompanies the dynamics of any open system .",
    "traditionally , the dynamics of an open quantum system are described by a `` master equation '' @xcite . the system @xmath10 , described initially by the density matrix @xmath16 , couples to a bath @xmath11 through an interaction hamiltonian @xmath17 .",
    "evolution generates an entangled state of the total system @xmath18 , and we trace over the bath state at the end . taking the system to be a simple harmonic oscillator , and using the simplest bilinear interaction in which photons are exchanged back and forth with the bath , we find in the born and markov approximations an equation of motion for the density matrix @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a coupling constant between the system and the environment .",
    "we have set @xmath21 in ( [ eq : adeqmot ] ) to reflect a reservoir at temperature @xmath22 much smaller than the system s energy scale @xmath23 .",
    "this process describes the gradual loss of energy from the system to the environment , and is known as _",
    "amplitude damping_@xcite .",
    "mathematically , the evolution of the density matrix from @xmath2 to @xmath24 in a particular process may be described as a linear transformation from one density matrix @xmath18 to another , @xmath25 .",
    "this may be expressed ( in the `` positive operator sum representation '' ) as @xmath26 where @xmath27 are positive linear operators , sometimes referred to as `` krauss effects@xcite , '' which are related to the lindblad operators appearing in eq.([eq : adeqmot ] ) . for amplitude damping , we find that @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the probability of loosing a single photon from the system between the initial and final times . after tracing over the final environmental state , we find the operators in the hilbert space of the system alone : @xmath30",
    "if the initial state is pure , it may be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the maximum occupation number of a single bosonic mode . here , the `` @xmath33 '' symbol represents a tensor sum of states , and @xmath34 is a convenient shorthand used to denote a mixed state , as distinguished from a pure state @xmath35 . in other words , @xmath36 %      = \\sum_{k=0}^n a_k |\\psi\\rangle   \\langle   \\psi| a_k^\\dagger \\,.\\ ] ]",
    "the mixed state @xmath37 is a tensor sum of @xmath38 ( un - normalized ) pure states which describe the @xmath38 possible final states of the system ; one may interpret these as non - interfering `` alternative histories@xcite . ''",
    "the normalization of each pure state gives its probability of occurrence .",
    "in general , @xmath0 describes the number of photons lost to the environment .",
    "it is important that even when no photons are lost to the environment , then the state of the system is changed .",
    "so far , we have described the effect of amplitude damping on a single mode system .",
    "consider now a system with @xmath39 modes , and let us use @xmath40 to denote the action of the effect @xmath27 on the @xmath41 mode of a state , @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "after amplitude damping , the initial pure state @xmath43 becomes the mixed state @xmath44           \\cdots          \\left[\\rule{0pt}{2.4ex } { \\bigoplus_{k=0}^{n } a_{km }              |{n_m}\\rangle               } \\right ]   \\ , , \\label{eq : mmodead}\\ ] ] where there are now @xmath45 possible final states .",
    "it is convenient to use the shorthand notation @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the @xmath41 digit of the number @xmath48 written in base n+1 , so that we may rewrite eq.([eq : mmodead ] ) as @xmath49 note that identical states in a tensor sum can be combined using the rule @xmath50 since an overall phase does nt matter ( assuming no entanglement with other systems ) .    as an example",
    ", amplitude damping of the state @xmath51 gives , using @xmath52 the output state @xmath53 this result can be understood intuitively : the original state only contains a single photon , and thus , whenever it is lost , the final state must be the vacuum .",
    "this example indicates that the state of eq.([eq : dualrail ] ) is useful for detection of a single photon loss .",
    "however , no useful information about @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be extracted from the vacuum state , and so it is not useful for error _",
    "let us motivate the remainder of this paper by considering the following example : we _ encode _ the logical zero and one states of a single qubit as @xmath54   % \\hspace*{3ex } %      |1_{l}\\rangle   = |{22}\\rangle \\,,\\ ] ] such that the initial state is the arbitrary qubit @xmath55 the possible outcomes after amplitude damping may be written as @xmath56 where we shall express @xmath48 as a base 5 numeral , and @xmath57 is an unnormalized pure state ( the norm of which gives its probability for occuring in the mixture ) . for small loss probability @xmath58 ,",
    "the most likely final state will be @xmath59 corresponding to no quanta being lost to the bath .",
    "the next most likely states result from the loss of a single photon : @xmath60   \\\\",

    "therefore , we limit our correction scheme to errors losing at most one quantum .",
    "each such error @xmath62 takes @xmath63 and @xmath64 to states @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively .",
    "the key is that @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 @xmath67 are mutually orthogonal , and so are @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 . in principle , a ( `` quantum non - demolition '' ) measurement scheme can detect all error syndromes . furthermore , for each @xmath71 , the norms of @xmath65 and @xmath66 are equal . after detecting an error syndrome , one can apply an appropriate unitary transformation converting @xmath65 and @xmath66 , to @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively .",
    "this makes possible the correction : @xmath72 \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is independent of @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "note , this is done without any information about @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and without diminishing the amplitude of the erroneous state . for this particular code",
    ", the output state has fidelity ( see eq.([eq : fido])@xcite ) @xmath74 with respect to the input .    as a comparison ,",
    "consider the code : @xmath75 with the most probable state : @xmath76 no unitary transformation will bring it back to @xmath77 unless @xmath10 , @xmath11 is predetermined ( a non - unitary transformation can revert the change , but it will reduce the fidelity of the correction process to 1-@xmath78 ) .    in the remainder of the paper , we shall describe the criteria for a scheme in which @xmath0 qubits may be encoded so that loss up to @xmath2 quanta may be corrected . for small @xmath2",
    ", a scheme will be exhibited .",
    "quantum error correction is just the reversing of some effect due to decoherence .",
    "general criteria for this to be possible have been given in the literature@xcite . in this particular case",
    ", we may express the required conditions in the following manner .",
    "let latexmath:[$\\{|c_0\\rangle \\cdots    which encode orthogonal logical states within the @xmath39 mode hilbert space with maximum total photon number @xmath32 , and define @xmath80 as the set of all @xmath39-digit base @xmath38 numbers whose digits sum to @xmath2 ( corresponding to @xmath2 errors ) .",
    "the logical states must satisfy @xmath81 for all @xmath82 . here",
    ", @xmath83 is some constant which depends only on @xmath48 .",
    "this is an extension of the non - degenerate quantum error correction code criteria given by @xcite to the case where none of the @xmath27 operators are identity .",
    "the first condition requires that all erroneous states be orthogonal , and the second requires that the encoded hilbert space not be deformed . here , we present an explicit statement of these two conditions as algebraic conditions on the code construction .",
    "we consider first a codeword @xmath84 which may be expressed as an equally weighted sum of @xmath85 energy eigenstates , @xmath86 ( we shall refer to these as _ quasi - classical states _ , `` qcs '' for short ) .",
    "when all the qcs are equally weighted , we call the code `` balanced '' .",
    "otherwise , the code is referred to as `` unbalanced '' .",
    "each codeword can be represented by a matrix with @xmath39 columns and @xmath85 rows , each row being one of the qcs in the codeword .",
    "for instance , if @xmath87 \\,,\\ ] ] then the corresponding matrix @xmath88 is : @xmath89   \\,.\\ ] ] for @xmath90 errors , we have @xmath91 , and @xmath92 where the row sum @xmath93 . criteria eq.([eq : crittwo ] ) requires the amplitudes of @xmath94 be the same for all @xmath84 , that is : @xmath95 be the same for all @xmath84 .",
    "a sufficient condition for this is the equality of all the @xmath96 for all @xmath71 and for all codewords @xmath84 .",
    "alternatively , one may say that the sum of any row from any @xmath88 equals @xmath32 , the same total photon number in all the qcs .",
    "denote the set of qcs with @xmath39 modes and total photon number @xmath32 as @xmath97 .",
    "it follows that if we construct all the codewords from states in @xmath97 , then the non - deformation constraint eq.([eq : crittwo ] ) is satisfied for @xmath90 .",
    "physically , this requirement stems from the fact that a state with higher number of quanta decays faster . to preserve the a posteriori probabilities of each codeword ,",
    "we must encode them in a subspace in which the decay probabilities are equal for all of them .",
    "similarly , for @xmath3 errors , we have @xmath98 , and , for example , @xmath99 and @xmath100 the non - deformation criteria requires the above sum to be the same for all codewords .",
    "equivalently , the column sum of the @xmath101 column of each codeword divided by @xmath85 has to be independent of the codeword .",
    "similar expressions for other @xmath102 give rise to similar criteria for each column separately .",

    "one should note that although codes can be constructed to correct an arbitrary number of photon loss , the more errors one wishes to correct , the more photons are required . on the other hand , having larger photon number states means a higher probability for the system as a whole to suffer loss of quanta .",
    "these two effects compete against each other to give an upper bound on the fidelity , which we can estimate as follows .",
    "let @xmath32 the required photon number , and @xmath2 be the total number of errors to be corrected .",
    "as previously discussed , due to the constraint equations which hold for error correction to be possible , the two parameters can be reduced to one degree of freedom , in terms of which we may estimate the optimal achievable fidelity . in terms of @xmath2 , the optimum fidelity for fixed @xmath58 is obtained by setting @xmath232 from eq.([eq : explicitfid ] ) , this gives to first order in @xmath58 @xmath233 where @xmath234 is a short hand notation for @xmath235 .",
    "using the stirling approximation for the factorials in @xmath234 , we obtain @xmath236 in general , @xmath32 is much larger than @xmath2 , which allows further simplification of eq.([eq : dfdt ] ) : @xmath237 generally , @xmath32 will asymptotically follow a power scaling law in @xmath2 , so we may approximate @xmath238 where the prefactor @xmath239 and exponent @xmath73 are approximately constant . solving for the optimum @xmath2 we find that @xmath240 plugging back into the eq.([eq : explicitfid ] ) gives us an estimate for the optimal achievable fidelity .",

    "if the qubits are measured , this circuit would then function equivalently to a perfect photon number detector .",

    "the circuit is then applied in reverse to undo the entanglement with the bosonic state , and the appropriate correction procedure is applied to fix the detected error .",
    "this is possible since generalized measurements may be performed on the qubit states to determine the error syndrome without destroying the superposition state of the original qubit encoded in the bosonic state .",
    "our treatment of amplitude damping errors is somewhat unusual from the standpoint of most quantum error correction theories , which deal with a bit flip and phase flip picture of errors .",
    "the relationship can be understood by expressing the @xmath303 and @xmath304 operators as coherent superpositions of such errors ; from eqs.([eq : adqubit ] ) and ( [ eq : adqubitend ] ) , @xmath305 \\\\   a_1 & = & \\frac{\\sqrt{\\gamma}}{2 } \\left[\\rule{0pt}{2.4ex } { \\sigma_x +          \\sigma_y } \\right ] \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with probabilities up to @xmath306 ,",

    "hence , a binary code correcting for any one bit error _ will _ indeed correct all amplitude damping errors up to losing one photon , although not to all orders .",
    "one reason we have studied bosonic codes is to exploit the possibilities for achieving higher efficiencies or easier physical implementation , though the study is theoretically interesting on its own .",
    "it is important to realize that amplitude damping errors are not independent bit errors , since the decay factor of each qcs depends on the total number of excitations in it .",
    "this fact is also pointed out by plenio _ et .",

    "the general relation between binary codes and amplitude damping is still under investigation .",
    "nevertheless , some interesting comparisons may be made .",

    "a naive evaluation of the quantum hamming bound@xcite for binary codes gives a possible rate of @xmath321 .",
    "non - deformation constraints are more restrictive on bosonic error correction codes than on binary codes , but the bosonic states admit coding schemes which are impossible with binary codes .",
    "there is no conclusive statement on comparing the general efficiencies of the two different type of codes , but the examples we have discovered indicate the existence of a rich variety of bosonic codes which may be useful in the future .    the code fidelities may also be compared .",

    "this agreement with the bosonic code is not accidental ; it stems from the use of the same total excitation number .",
    "however , it is worthwhile to point out that despite the effort to balance the codewords , the five - bit code still has better performance on average , due to the small number of excitation involved in the system .    in conclusion",
    ", we have given general criteria for an error correction code which encodes qubits in bosonic states .",
    "this is a generalization of the binary error correction codes .",
    "motivated by the dominant decoherence process ( amplitude damping ) of system such as photons transmitted through optical fibers we classify our errors according to the number of excitations lost , instead of the more common classification of the number of bits or modes corrupted .",
    "we have shown , in one case , specialization to correction amplitude damping does improve the rate , number of encoded qubits to number of required qubits . however , bosonic codes under amplitude damping suffer constraints involving deformation of the hilbert space not shared by the binary codes , rendering the efficiencies lower in the bosonic case when many qubits are encoded .",
    "it is too early to conclude on the relative performance of the binary codes and the bosonic codes .",
    "further study will aim at improving the efficiencies , perhaps by using relative phases to maintain orthogonality of the codewords instead of by using distinct qcs , so that the qcs can occur in more than one codeword .",
    "another possibility is to encode qubits using qcs of different total number of excitations .",
