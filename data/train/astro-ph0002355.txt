    "we believe that the continuum radiation we see from blazars comes from the transformation of bulk kinetic energy , and possibly poynting flux , into random energy of particles , which quickly produce beamed emission through the synchrotron and the inverse compton process .",
    "this is analogous to what we believe is happening in gamma ",
    "ray bursts , although the bulk lorentz factor of their flow is initially larger .",
    "evidences for bulk motion in blazars with lorentz factors between 5 and 20 have been accumulated along the years , especially through the monitoring of superluminally moving blobs on the vlbi scale ( vermeulen & cohen 1994 ) , and , more recently , through the detection of very large variable powers emitted above 100 mev ( see the third egret catalogue , hartman et al . , 1999 ) , which require beaming for the source to be transparent to photon  photon absorption ( e.g. dondi & ghisellini , 1995 ) .",
    "the explanation of intraday variations of the radio flux , leading to brightness temperatures in excess of @xmath1 k ( much exceeding the compton limit ) are instead still controversial ( wagner & witzel 1995 ) .",
    "interstellar scintillation is surely involved , but it can work only if the angular diameter of the variable sources is so small to nevertheless lead to @xmath2 k , which requires either a coherent process to be at work ( e.g. benford & lesch 1998 ) or a doppler factor of the order of a thousand .",
    "another controversial issue is the matter content of jets .",
    "we still do not know if they are dominated by electron  positron pairs or by normal electron ",
    "proton plasma ( see the reviews by celotti , 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "part of our ignorance comes from the difficulty of estimating intrinsic quantities , such as the magnetic field and the particle densities , using the observed flux , which is strongly modified by the effects of relativistic aberration , time contraction and blueshift , all dependent on the unknown plasma bulk velocity and viewing angle .",
    "furthermore it is now clear ( especially thanks to multiwavelength campaigns ) that the blazar phenomenon is complex .    on the optimistic side",
    ", we have for the first time a complete information of the blazar energy output , after the discovery of their @xmath0ray emission , and some hints on the acceleration process , through the behaviour of flux variability detected simultaneously in different bands ( see the review by ulrich , maraschi & urry 1996 ) .",
    "also , blazar research can now take advantage of the explosion of studies regarding gamma ",
    "ray bursts , which face the same problem of how to transform ordered to random energy to produce beamed radiation ( for reviews : piran 1999 ; meszaros 1999 ) .",
    "despite the prediction that jets carry plasma in relativistic motion dates back to 1966 ( rees , 1966 ) , and intense studies over the last 20 years ( begelman , blandford & rees , 1984 ) , quantitative estimates of the amount of power transported in jets have been done only relatively recently , following new observational results .",
    "one important point is that the extended ( or lobe ) radio emission of radiogalaxies and quasars traces the energy content of the emitting region . through minimum energy arguments and estimates of the lobe lifetime by spectral aging of the observed synchrotron emission and/or by dynamical arguments , rawlings & saunders ( 1991 ) found a nice correlation between the average power that must be supplied to the lobes and the power emitted by the narrow line region .",
    "although one always expects some correlation between powers ( they both scales with the square of the luminosity distance ) it is the ratio of the two quantities to be interesting , being of order of 100 .",
    "since we also know that , on average , the total luminosity in narrow lines is of the order of one per cent of the ionizing luminosity , we have the remarkable indication that the power carried by the jet ( supplying the extended regions of the radio  source ) and the power produced by the accretion disk ( illuminating the narrow line clouds ) are of the same order .",
    "celotti , padovani and ghisellini ( 1997 ) later confirmed this by calculating the kinetic power of the jet at the vlbi scale ( see celotti & fabian 1993 ) and the broad line luminosity ( assumed to reprocess @xmath3 of the ionizing luminosity ) .",
    "a possible explanation involves the magnetic field being responsible for both the extraction of spin energy of a rotating black hole and the extraction of gravitational energy of the accreting matter .",
    "assume in fact that the main mechanism to power the jet is the blandford ",
    "znajek ( 1977 ) process : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the specific black hole angular momentum ( @xmath6 for a maximally rotating kerr hole ) , @xmath7 is the magnetic energy density and @xmath8 is the schwarzchild radius . note that eq .",
    "1 has the form of a poynting flux .",
    "assume now that most of the luminosity of the accretion disk is produced at @xmath9 .",
    "the corresponding radiation energy density is then @xmath10 , leading to @xmath11 therefore a magnetic field in equipartion with the radiation energy density of the disk would lead to @xmath12 .",
    "we can estimate the ratio of the outflowing ( in the jet ) to the inflowing mass rate , since @xmath13 if jets carry as much energy as the one produced by the accretion disk , we then obtain that the mass outflow rate is @xmath14 of the accreting mass rate ( if @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) .",
    "bl lac objects and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) are characterized by very rapid and large amplitude variability , power law spectra in restricted energy bands and strong @xmath0ray emission .",
    "these common properties justify their belonging to the same blazar class .",
    "however they differ in many other respects , such as the presence ( in fsrq ) or absence ( in bl lacs ) of broad emission lines , the radio to optical flux ratio , the relative importance of the @xmath0ray emission , the polarization degree , and the variability behavior . within the bl lac class , giommi & padovani ( 1994 )",
    "have subdivided the objects according to where ( i.e. at what frequency ) the first broad ( synchrotron ) peak is located .",
    "low energy peaked bl lacs ( lbl ) show a peak in the ir  optical bands , while in high energy peaked bl lacs ( hbl ) this is in the x  ray band ( see , in this volume , the contributions of costamante et al .",
    ", giommi et al . , pian et al.,tagliaferri et al . , tavecchio & maraschi , wolter et al . ) .    as the emission of all blazars",
    "is beamed towards us , so there must be a parent population of objects pointing in other directions .",
    "the parent populations of bl lacs and fsrqs are believed to be fr i and more powerful fr ii radio galaxies , respectively ( see the review by urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "the absence of broad emission lines in bl lacs is shared by fr i radio galaxies , whose nuclei are well visible by hubble space telescope observations ( chiaberge , capetti & celotti 1999 ) .",
    "this suggests that in fr i and bl lac objects broad emission lines are intrinsically weaker than in more powerful objects .",
    "fossati et al . ( 1998 ) found that the sed of all blazars is related to their observed luminosity .",
    "there is a rather well defined trend",
    ": low luminosity objects are hbl  like , and furthermore their high energy peak is in the gev  tev band . as the bolometric luminosity increases , both peaks shift to lower frequencies , and the high energy emission is increasingly more dominating the total output . ghisellini et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , fitted the sed of all blazars detected in the @xmath0ray band for which the distance and some spectral information of the high energy radiation were available .",
    "they found a correlation between the energy @xmath17 of the electrons emitting at the peaks of the spectrum and the amount of energy density @xmath18 ( both in radiation and in magnetic field ) , as measured in the comoving frame : @xmath19 .",
    "this indicates that , at @xmath20 , the radiative cooling rate @xmath21const .",
    "it also suggests that this may be due to a  universal \" acceleration mechanism , which must be nearly independent of @xmath0 and @xmath18 : in less powerful sources with weak magnetic field and weak lines the radiative cooling is less severe and electrons can be accelerated up to very high energies , producing a sed typical of a hbl .",
    "the paucity of photons produced externally to the jet leaves synchrotron self  compton as the only channel to produce high energy radiation . at the other extreme , in the most powerful sources with strong emission lines",
    ", electrons can not be accelerated to high energies because of severe cooling .",
    "their spectrum is therefore peaked in the far ir and in the mev band . in these sources",
    "the inverse compton scattering off externally produced photons is the dominant cooling mechanism , producing a dominant @xmath0ray luminosity .",
    "for the same sample of blazars fitted in ghisellini et al .",
    "( 1998 ) we can estimate the powers radiated and transported by jets in the form of cold protons , magnetic field and hot electrons and/or electron  positron pairs . since the model allows to determine the bulk lorentz factor , the dimension of the emitting region , the value of the magnetic field and the particle density , we can then determine @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the comoving proton and lepton densities , respectively , @xmath25 is the cross section radius of the jet , and @xmath26 is the average lepton energy . these powers can be compared with the radiated one estimated in the same frame ( in which the emitting blob is seen moving ) .",
    "the power radiated _ in the entire solid angle _ is thus @xmath27 ( the same holds for the power @xmath28 emitted by the synchrotron process ) .",
    "all these quantities are plotted in fig . 2 ( celotti & ghisellini 2000 , in prep . ) . in this figure",
    "hatched areas correspond to bl lac objects .",
    "several facts are to be noted :    * if the jet is made by a pure electron  positron plasma , then the associated kinetic power is @xmath29 . however , we note that @xmath30 posing a serious energy budget problem . * if there is a proton for each electron , the bulk kinetic power @xmath31 .",
    "this corresponds to an efficiency of @xmath3 in converting bulk into random energy .",
    "the remaining 90% is therefore available to power the radio lobes , as required . *",
    "the power in the poynting flux , @xmath32 , is of the same order of @xmath29 , indicating that the magnetic field is close to equipartition with the electron energy density .",
    "this suggests that , on these scales , the magnetic field is not a prime energy carrier , but is a sub  product of the process transforming bulk into random energy .",
    "-1 true cm    -2 .",
    "true cm    -7 true cm",
    "the central engine may well inject energy into the jet in a discontinuous way , with individual shells or blobs having different masses , bulk lorentz factors and energies .",
    "if this occurs there will be collisions between shells , with a faster shell catching up a slower one .",
    "this idea has become the leading model to explain the emission of gamma ",
    "ray bursts , but it was born in the agn field , due to rees ( 1978 ) ( see also sikora 1994 ) .    * * location  * the @xmath0ray emission of blazars and its rapid variability imply that there must be a preferred location where dissipation of the bulk motion energy occurs .",
    "if it were at the base of the jet , and hence close to the accretion disk , the produced @xmath0rays would be inevitably absorbed by photon ",
    "photon collisions , with associated copious pair production , reprocessing the original power from the @xmath0ray to the x  ray part of the spectrum ( contrary to observations ) . if it were far away , in a large region of the jet , it becomes difficult to explain the observed fast variability , even accounting for the time  shortening due to the doppler effect .",
    "the region where the radiation is produced is then most likely located at a few hundreds of schwarzchild radii ( @xmath33 cm ) from the base of the jet , within the broad line region ( see ghisellini & madau 1996 for more details ) .",
    "the extra seed photons provided by emission lines enhance the efficiency of the compton process responsible for the @xmath0ray emission .",
    "this is indeed the typical distance at which two shells , initially separated by @xmath34 cm ( comparable to a few schwarzschild radii ) and moving with @xmath35 and @xmath36 would collide . *",
    "* variability timescales  * in fact if the initial separation of the two shells is @xmath37 and if they have lorentz factors @xmath38 , @xmath39 , they will collide at @xmath40 if the shell widths are of the same order of their initial separation the time needed to cross each other is of the order of @xmath41 .",
    "the observer at a viewing angle @xmath42 will see this time doppler contracted by the factor @xmath43 .",
    "the typical variability timescale is therefore of the same order of the initial shell separation .",
    "if the mechanism powering grb and blazar emission is the same , we should expect a similar light curve from both systems , but with times appropriately scaled by the different @xmath37 , i.e. the different masses of the involved black holes .",
    "* * efficiencies  * as most of the power transported by the jet must reach the radio lobes , only a small fraction can be radiatively dissipated .",
    "the efficiency @xmath44 of two blobs / shells for converting ordered into random energy depends on their masses @xmath45 , @xmath46 and bulk lorentz factors @xmath38 , @xmath39 , as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the bulk lorentz factor after the interaction and is given by ( see e.g. lazzati , ghisellini & celotti 1999 ) @xmath49 the above relations imply , for shells of equal masses and @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "+ efficiencies @xmath44 around 510% are just what needed for blazar jets . * * peak energies ?  * in the rest frame of the fast shell , the bulk kinetic energy of each proton of the slower shell is @xmath53 , where @xmath54 .",
    "this is what can be transformed into random energy .",
    "assume now that the electrons share this available energy ( through an unspecified acceleration mechanism ) . in the comoving frame",
    ", the acceleration rate can be written as @xmath55 .",
    "the typical heating timescale may correspond to the time needed for the two shells to cross , i.e. @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the shell width ( measured in the same frame ) .",
    "the heating and the radiative cooling rates will balance for some value of the random electron lorentz factor @xmath58 : @xmath59 the agreement of the above simple relation with what can be derived from model fitting the sed of blazars is surprisingly good ( see ghisellini 2000 ) . * * radio flares ",
    "* collisions between shells may ( and should ) happen in a hierarchical way .",
    "as an illustrative example , assume that one pair of shells after the collision moves with a final lorentz factor @xmath60 ( this number corresponds to @xmath16 and 20 for the two shells before the interaction ) .",
    "the collision produces a flare say in the optical and @xmath0ray bands . after some observed time @xmath61 two other shells",
    "collide and another flare is produced .",
    "assume that the final lorentz factor is now @xmath62 ( corresponding to an initial @xmath63 and 30 before collision ) .",
    "since the second pair is faster , it will catch up the first one after a distance ( from eq .",
    "5 ) @xmath64 .",
    "a time separation of @xmath65 a day between the two flares then corresponds to @xmath66 1 pc , i.e. the region of the radio emission of the core .",
    "due again to doppler contraction , this radio flare will be observed ony a few days after the second optical flare . since the ratio @xmath67 is small , the efficiency is also small ( at least a factor 10 smaller than the firsts shocks ) .",
    "there is then the intriguing possibility of explaining the birth of radio blobs after intense activity ( i.e. more than one flare ) of the higher energy flux .",
    "radio light ",
    "curves should have _ some _ memory of what has happened days  weeks earlier at higher frequencies .",
    "here i will dare to assemble different pieces of information gathered in recent years in a coherent , albeit still preliminary , picture .",
    "there is a link between the extraction of gravitational energy in an accretion disk and the formation and acceleration of jets , since both have the same power .",
    "objects of low luminosity accretion disks also lack strong emission lines , suggesting that it is the paucity of ionizing photons , not of gas , the reason for the lack of strong lines in bl lacs .",
    "correspondingly , this implies that , if fr i are the parents of bl lacs , they also have intrinsically weak line emission ( i.e. no need for an obscuring torus ) . despite the fact that the jet power in blazars spans at least four orders of magnitude , the average bulk lorentz factor is almost the same , suggesting a link between the power and the mass outflowing rate : their ratio is constant . in the region where most of the radiation is produced , the jet is heavy , in the sense that protons carry most of the bulk kinetic energy .",
    "there the jet dissipates @xmath3 of its power and produces beamed radiation .",
    "the power dissipated at larger distances is much less , and therefore the jet can transport @xmath68 of its original power to the radio extended regions .",
    "one way to achieve this is through internal shocks , which can explain why the major dissipation occurs at a few hundreds schwarzchild radii , why the efficiency is of the order of 10% , and give clues on the observed variability timescales and even on why electrons are accelerated at a preferred energy .",
    "the spectral energy distribution of blazars depends on where shell  shell collisions take place , and on the amount of seed photons present there . even in a single source it is possible that the separation of two consecutive shells is sometimes large , resulting in a collision occuring outside the broad line region . in this case",
    "the corresponding spectrum should be produced by the synchrotron self  compton process only , without the contribution of external photons : we then expect a simultaneous optical@xmath0ray flare of roughly equal powers ( but with the self  compton flux varying quadratically , see ghisellini & maraschi 1966 ) .",
    "this is what should always happen in lineless bl lac objects . on the other hand ,",
    "if the initial separation of the two shells is small ( or the @xmath69factor of the slower one is small ) , the collision takes place close to the disk .",
    "x  rays produced by the disk would then absorb all the produced @xmath0rays and a pair cascade would develop , reprocessing the power originally in the @xmath0ray band mainly into the x  ray band .",
    "we should therefore see an x  ray flare without accompanying emission above @xmath70 .",
    "pairs of shells which have already collided can interact again between themselves , at distances appropriate for the radio emission .",
    "this offers the interesting possibility to explain why the radio luminosity is related with the @xmath0ray one , and why radio flares are associated with flares at higher frequencies .",
    "work is in progress in order to quantitatively test this idea against observations .",
