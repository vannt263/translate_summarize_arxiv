    "a brain  computer interface ( bci ) is a technology the uses only the central nervous system signals ( brainwaves ) of paralyzed or locked  in syndrome ( lis ) patients  @xcite to create a new communication channel with others or to control external devices without depending on any muscle activity  @xcite .",
    "the bci technology has provided a support already to patients life improvement who suffer from severe paralysis due to diseases like an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als )  @xcite .",
    "the contemporary bci applications rely mostly on a visual mode , which generates the most reliable event related potentials ( erp ) so far  @xcite .",
    "however , many lis patients in the advanced disease stages often lose their ability to control reliably even their eyeball focusing or movement abilities  @xcite , and therefore they need the alternative options for bci  enabled communication .",
    "the successful alternative options have been developed recently to utilize spatial auditory  @xcite or tactile ( somatosensory ) modes  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the tactile bci seems to offer the superior communication options in comparison with the contemporary visual and auditory modes in case of lis patients  @xcite .",
    "we present results of a followup study with an extended number to ten subjects comparing to our previous reports  @xcite .",
    "we test the tactile point ",
    "pressure stimulus  based brain  computer interface ( tpbci ) using stimuli generated by a matrix of small solenoids ( see figure  [ fig : position ] ) .",
    "the tpbci device can generate various patterns to be applied to possibly different body areas , and therefore it could be adopted to many patient symptoms .",
    "the presented approach allows for faster and more precise delivery of tactile pressure stimuli comparing to the previously proposed vibrotactile stimulator  based approaches  @xcite and it is not limited to finger tips only  @xcite .    the goal of this study is to compare and test the performance ( bci classification accuracy ) of the novel tpbci paradigm  @xcite in function of two inter  stimulus interval ( isi ) settings .",
    "namely the isi equal to @xmath0  ms ( a very easy for the users ) and @xmath1  ms ( a harder case due to fast repetition of the presented pin  pressure patterns and larger overlap of the brainwave erps ) .",
    "results obtained with ten healthy users offline analysis with stepwise linear discriminant analysis ( swlda ) classifier  @xcite and five different averaging settings are analyzed for statistical siginficance .    from now on the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present methods used and developed in order to capture , process and classify the brainwave response in application to the proposed tpbci .",
    "offline eeg analysis results together with conclusions summarize the paper .",
    "the tactile stimuli were delivered as light pin  pressure patterns generated by a portable computer with a program developed by our team on the arduino uno micro ",
    "controller board managed from our visual programming application designed in max  6  @xcite .",
    "each tactile stimulus pattern was generated via the tactile pressure device composed of nine solenoids arranged in the @xmath2 matrix as depicted in figure  [ fig : position ] .",
    "the binary outputs from the arduino uno micro ",
    "controller board were amplified by a multichannel amplifier ( battery driven for user s safety ) developed also by our team .",
    "there were six linear pattens of tactile pressure stimuli delivered in random order to the user fingers ( for details please refer to  @xcite ) in order to elicit p300 brainwave responses in an oddball style paradigm  @xcite .",
    "the solenoids generated quick , @xmath3  ms long , light pin  pressures with inter  stimulus intervals ( isi ) of @xmath1  ms and @xmath0  ms in two settings as explained in table  [ table : eegexperimentcondition ] with experimental condition details .",
    "the two different isi setups were tested in order to evaluate a possible impact of the fast stimulation repetitions on user s bci performance ( the resulting bci accuracy ) in five different averaging scenarios .      during the eeg experiments",
    ", the users placed the tactile stimulus generator on their dominant hand s fingers with a plastic glove to prevent any spurious electric current interferences possibly originating from the device .",
    "the users responded mentally by confirming / counting only to the instructed patterns while ignoring the others .",
    "the training instructions were presented visually by means of the max  6  @xcite programmed display designed by our team as depicted in figure  [ fig : max1 ] .",
    "symbols inform about the pattern shape to be attended by a user in each swlda training experimental run . ]    in the online bci experiments ( similarly as in our previous study  @xcite ) the eeg signals were captured with a portable eeg amplifier system g.usbamp from g.tec medical instruments , austria .",
    "eight active wet eeg electrodes were used to capture brainwaves with attentional modulation elucidated , within the event related potentials ( erps ) , the so - called `` aha- '' or p300-responses  @xcite .",
    "the eeg electrodes were attached to the head locations _ cz , cpz , p3 , p4 , c3 , c4 , cp5 _ , and _",
    "cp6 _ as in @xmath4 intentional system  @xcite .",
    "a reference electrode was attached to a left earlobe and a ground electrode on the forehead at _ fpz _ position respectively .",
    "the experimental details are summarized in table  [ table : eegexperimentcondition ] .",
    "the users were requested to limit their eye  blinks and body muscle movements to avoid electromagnetic and electromyographic interferences .",
    "the unavoidable eye  blinks were identified within the erps and removed with a threshold setting of @xmath5v .",
    "all eeg experiments were conducted in the life science center of tara , university of tsukuba , japan .",
    "the details of the experimental procedures and the research targets of the tpbci paradigm were explained in detail to the seven human users , who agreed voluntarily to participate in the study .",
    "the electroencephalogram ( eeg ) tpbci experiments were conducted in accordance with _ the world medical association declaration of helsinki - ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects_. the experimental procedures were approved and designed in agreement with the ethical committee guidelines of the faculty of engineering , information and systems at university of tsukuba , tsukuba , japan ( experimental permission no .",
    "@xmath6 ) .",
    "ten subjects participated in two studies with various isi settings for tbci s stimulus speed and difficulty evaluation . the average age of the users was of @xmath7 years old ( standard deviation of @xmath8 years old ; ten men ) .",
    ".conditions and details of the tpbci eeg experiment [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]          the eeg signals were recorded and preprocessed online by an in  house extended bci2000 application  @xcite and segmented ( `` epoched '' ) as features drawn from erp intervals of @xmath9  ms .",
    "a common average reference ( car ) filter were also applied to the segmented signals .",
    "the sampling rate was set to @xmath10  hz , the high pass filter at @xmath11  hz , and the low pass filter at @xmath12  hz . the isi were of @xmath1  ms or @xmath0  ms in two different experimental runs , and each tactile pressure stimulus duration was of @xmath3  ms .",
    "each user performed two sessions of selecting the six patterns ( a spelling of a sequence of six digits associated with each tactile pressure pattern ) .",
    "each target was presented five times in a random series with the remaining non  targets .",
    "we performed offline analysis of the collected online eeg datasets in order to test a possible influence of the two isi settings on the tpbci accuracy ( compare erp results in figures  [ fig : erp300 ]  and  [ fig : erp120 ] depicting an impact of faster isi on the erp shapes and areas under the curve ( auc ) based discriminative latencies ) . the stepwise linear discriminant analysis ( swlda )",

    "the results were slightly better for the longer isi of @xmath0  ms , yet this observation was not confirmed with a wilcoxon rank sum test of a statistical significance for equal medians ( the distributions were not normal ) .",
    "we concluded that the analysis of eeg data obtained from the ten healthy subjects did not confirmed significantly that shorter isi , causing a larger experimental difficulty , would sabotage the tpbci accuracy as summarized in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "the aim of this study was to test the isi variability impact on the bci classification accuracy results in various brainwave averaging scenarios of the proposed tactile pin  pressure bci paradigm .",
    "the offline results obtained with the swlda classifier did not show significant differences , although the median tpbci classification results for isi of @xmath0  ms seemed to be higher .",
    "the results are very promising for future online applications with patients suffering from lis allowing for speeding up the bci stimuli presentation without significant classification drop danger .",

    "thus , we can expect that patients suffering from lis will be able to use the appropriate bci interfaces , according to their intact sensory modalities , more efficiently and comfortably to restore their basic communication needs .",
