    "quantum physics has been applied to enhance communication security .",
    "a well - known example is quantum key distribution ( qkd ) @xcite , which has been proved to be unconditionally secure in principle @xcite .",
    "more recently , position - based quantum cryptography ( pbqc ) has drawn a lot of attention @xcite .    in pbqc , a legitimate party uses its geographical location as its only credential to implement various cryptographic protocols .",
    "one fundamental task in pbqc is secure position verification , in which an honest prover tries to prove to a set of trusted verifiers that he / she is at a certain location .",
    "it has been shown that , given a secure position verification scheme , other position - based cryptographic tasks , such as authentication and key distribution , can also be implemented @xcite .",
    "although previous studies have shown that any pbqc protocols are breakable if the adversaries pre - share an arbitrarily large entangled state @xcite , the security of pbqc in the bounded - quantum - storage model , which is more relevant in practice , is still an open question . in @xcite ,",
    "the security of pbqc has been proved based on the assumption that no entanglement is pre - shared between adversaries . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors proposed a one - round quantum position verification scheme and proved its security against adversaries with an amount of pre - shared entanglement that is linear in the number of qubits transmitted .",
    "in contrast , all classical position - based cryptographic protocols are breakable without using pre - shared entanglement @xcite .",
    "this highlights the advantage of pbqc over its classical counterpart .",
    "one important issue in pbqc which has not been carefully addressed is its tolerance to the loss of the quantum communication channel . in most of the previous studies",
    ", the bb84 encoding scheme has been adopted to implement a pbqc protocol .",
    "it is easy to show ( see section [ sec:2 ] ) that the above protocol is insecure as long as the overall loss is above @xmath2 db . in practice ,",
    "the loss of the measurement device itself ( including optical coupling loss and detector efficiency ) is typically above @xmath2 db .",
    "this suggests the bb84-type pbqc protocols are impractical .    in this paper",
    ", we explore pbqc protocols which can go beyond the above 3 db limit .",
    "we study the performance of various pbqc protocols over a lossy channel under the assumption that no entanglement is pre - shared between adversaries .",
    "these pbqc protocls are derived naturally from the corresponding qkd schemes , including both discrete - variable ( dv ) and continuous - variable ( cv ) schemes .",
    "our study shows that a dv pbqc protocol , which was proposed in @xcite , can tolerate an arbitrarily high loss in the noiseless case . by introducing the decoy state idea @xcite",
    ", the above protocol can tolerate an overall loss of 13 db at a quantum bit error rate ( qber ) of @xmath1% , even when implemented with a practical weak coherent source and realistic single photon detectors ( spds ) .",
    "in contrast , all the cv pbqc protocols studied in this paper suffer from a @xmath2 db loss limitation , even by using arbitrarily squeezed states and noiseless detectors .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec:2 ] , we outline the basic procedures of a pbqc protocol and the main assumptions we adopt . in section [ sec : dv ] , we study the performance of a dv pbqc protocol in both ideal and realistic scenarios . in section [ sec : cv ] , we present our results of cv pbqc protocols .",
    "we conclude with a brief discussion in section [ sec : dis ] .",
    "for simplicity , in this paper , we only consider the one - dimensional case with two verifiers , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and a prover @xmath5 in the middle .",
    "the verifiers wish to verify the position of @xmath5 . unfortunately , there are two adversaries , @xmath6 ( between @xmath3 and @xmath5 ) and @xmath7 ( between @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) who will try to fake @xmath5 .",
    "we assume that @xmath3 and @xmath4 hold synchronized clocks and they also share a secure communication channel ( which could be established by using qkd ) . @xmath6 and @xmath7 have full control of the communication channels ( both quantum and classical ) between @xmath3 and @xmath5 , as well as the one between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , they have perfect detectors ( noiseless and lossless ) and can perform any local operations allowed by quantum mechanics with arbitrarily high precision .",
    "however , @xmath6 and @xmath7 do not share any entanglement .",
    "note that in the above picture , the adversaries can completely hijack signals from @xmath5 .",
    "so , we can simply ignore the existence of @xmath5 in our discussion below .",
    "most existing pbqc protocols are based on the bb84-type coding scheme .",
    "the basic procedure is summarized below :    1 .",
    "the verifiers agree on random bits @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath3 prepares a qubit in the state |=",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 are computational basis states , and @xmath11 is the hadamard matrix .",
    "2 .   @xmath3 sends @xmath12 to @xmath5 through a free - space quantum channel , and @xmath4 sends @xmath13 to @xmath5 through a free - space classical channel . @xmath3 and @xmath4 coordinate their transmission time to make sure that @xmath12 and @xmath13 arrive at @xmath5 at the same time .",
    "as soon as @xmath12 and @xmath13 arrive , @xmath5 performs a measurement in the basis @xmath14 and broadcasts the measurement result @xmath15 back to @xmath3 and @xmath4 immediately .",
    "if the verifiers receive @xmath15 at the time consistent with the position of @xmath5 , _ and _ @xmath15 agrees with @xmath16 , the location of @xmath5 is accepted as authenticated .    intuitively , the security of the above protocol can be understood from the quantum no - cloning theorem @xcite : after step 2 , @xmath6 can intercept @xmath12 and @xmath7 can intercept @xmath13 before @xmath5 receives them .",
    "however , without the other piece of information , neither of them can perform step 3 . while @xmath7 can keep one copy of the classical information @xmath13 and forward another copy to @xmath6",
    ", @xmath6 can not make perfect copies of the quantum state @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath6 keeps @xmath12 in a quantum memory and performs the measurement after she receives @xmath13 from @xmath7 , it will be too late to report the measurement result back to @xmath4 .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath6 forwards @xmath12 to @xmath7 , who in turn performs the measurement , it will be too late to report the measurement result back to @xmath3 .",
    "we remark that the above argument is fallacious if @xmath6 and @xmath7 pre - share entanglement , which allows them to perform quantum teleportation @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will only consider the case of no pre - shared entanglement between adversaries .",
    "one major issue in practice is the low reporting rate expected from honest @xmath5 . due to the channel loss and the low efficiency of practical spds , most of the time",
    ", @xmath5 will report a `` no detection '' event .",
    "the adversaries can take advantage of the low detection probability and fool the verifiers . more specifically ,",
    "once @xmath6 receives @xmath12 , she randomly chooses one of the two bases and performs a measurement .",
    "then she forwards a copy of her basis information and the measurement result to @xmath7 . on the other hand ,",
    "once @xmath7 receives @xmath13 , she forwards a copy to @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath6 happens to use the correct basis , @xmath6 and @xmath7 report the measurement result to @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "otherwise , they claim no detection .",
    "since there are only two possible bases in the above protocol , the adversaries can achieve a @xmath17 reporting rate without introducing errors .",
    "this suggests that the above protocol is insecure as long as the overall loss is above @xmath2 db.s source , which can not be accessed by the adversaries , and can be well calibrated by the verifiers . ]",
    "considering the high coupling loss of a free - space communication channel and the low detection efficiency of a practical spd , the above pbqc protocol may only work over a very short distance . to make pbqc useful in practice , we need protocols which can go beyond this @xmath2 db limit . in the rest of this paper",
    ", we study the performance of various pbqc protocols over a lossy channel under the assumption that no entanglement is pre - shared between adversaries .",
    "one approach to the development of a loss - tolerant pbqc protocol is to employ more than two encoding bases .",
    "here we study the performance of a pbqc protocol based on a natural extension of the bb84 coding scheme , where @xmath3 employs @xmath18 encoding bases uniformly distributed over the whole bloch sphere .",
    "compared to the original pbqc scheme , this protocol also has an enhanced security @xcite .",

    "as noted in @xcite , noisy operation in the honest case do not produce inconsistent results between different verifiers .",
    "this is because the classical communication channel used by @xmath5 to broadcast the measurement results is virtually noiseless . by performing step 5 ,",

    "as @xmath33 , the adversaries reporting rate @xmath34 , which suggests that the above protocol can tolerate arbitrarily high channel loss in the noiseless case .    in practice ,",
    "the quantum communication system between @xmath3 and @xmath5 is noisy due to imperfect state preparation , detector noise , etc . in this case",
    ", the expected qber from the honest @xmath5 will not be zero .",

    "as long as the adversaries can produce the same reporting rate and the qber expected from the honest @xmath5 at a time consistent with the position of @xmath5 , the security of the pbqc protocol is compromised .",
    "the hacking strategy is discussed in detail in the appendix in the case of a finite @xmath18 . here , we proceed with a description of the strategy in the large @xmath18 limit .",
    "as soon as @xmath6 receives the quantum state @xmath12 , she measures it in a basis randomly chosen from the whole bloch sphere always chooses the same basis , the reporting probability will depend on @xmath3 s basis .",

    "it also shows how much loss the pbqc protocol can tolerate given an intrinsic qber .",
    "for example , if the intrinsic qber of the legitimate quantum communication system is @xmath1% , then the adversaries could reproduce the same qber with a reporting rate of up to @xmath44% .",
    "this reporting rate is consistent with the one expected from a quantum channel with an overall loss of @xmath45 db .",
    "this implies that given a @xmath1% intrinsic qber , this protocol is secure as long as the overall loss is below @xmath45 db . in general , the lower the intrinsic qber , the higher the tolerable loss .    in the appendix",
    ", we study the case of a finite number @xmath18 of uniformly distributed bases and obtain the maximum reporting rate for a given qber .",
    "as we show there , the above results are recovered in the large @xmath18 limit .",
    "the convergence is actually fast , indicating that for practical applications @xmath18 need not be very large .      a high quality , efficient single photon source is not available in practice . in this subsection",
    ", we will study the performance of the above pbqc protocol implemented with a practical attenuated laser source .",
    "we assume that the global phase of each laser pulse has been randomized properly , so we can model the source as a phase - randomized weak coherent state .",
    "the performance of the bb84 qkd protocol degrades significantly when implemented with a phase - randomized weak coherent state .",
    "this is mainly due to the photon number splitting ( pns ) attack @xcite : if the quantum signal contains more than one photons , an eavesdropper can split out one photon , store it in a quantum memory , and perform a measurement when the basis information is available .",
    "one way to solve the above problem is to introduce the decoy state idea @xcite .",
    "as we will show below , the decoy state idea can also be applied in pbqc protocols .",
    "the photon number of a coherent state follows a poisson distribution : p_n = e^-_1 where @xmath46 is the average photon number of the coherent state , which is determined by @xmath3 .",
    "we assume that the quantum communication system between @xmath3 and @xmath5 is characterized by the following parameters : @xmath25  the overall transmittance ; @xmath47  the dark - count probability of spd ; and @xmath48  the error probability due to misalignment .    in normal conditions ( no adversaries ) ,",

    "however , in practice , the quantum state prepared by @xmath3 can not be perfect ( or @xmath3 may intentionally introduce a small amount of noise ) .",
    "so the above attack will produce inconsistent results received by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and thus can be detected in step 5 of the protocol .",
    "] we define @xmath53 and @xmath54 as the conditional reporting rate and qber , respectively , given that @xmath3 s signal contains @xmath49 photons . in the attack outlined above , @xmath55 , whereas for a given @xmath43 , @xmath42 is upper bounded by eq .  .",
    "in the case of @xmath52 , determining the optimal measurement strategy for @xmath6 is a problem related to the problem of optimal state estimation with post - measurement information @xcite .",

    "to make their attack undetectable , the adversaries need to match @xmath59 and @xmath60 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 by adjusting @xmath42 .",

    "our simulation shows that as long as the overall transmittance @xmath66 ( which corresponds to @xmath67 db loss ) , the above pbqc protocol is insecure .",
    "this shows that the performance of the pbqc implemented with a weak coherence source is worse than the one implemented with a perfect single photon source .",
    "the basic idea of the decoy - state protocol is quite simple . for each transmission",
    ", @xmath3 randomly chooses a number from a predetermined set @xmath68 , and sets the average photon number of the weak coherent pulse to the corresponding value . at the end of the protocol",

    "this result is comparable with the one based on a perfect single photon source .",
    "furthermore , compared with the weak coherent state protocol without decoy states , the decoy state protocol allows @xmath3 to use a relatively large average photon number , which is more efficient .",
    "continuous - variable ( cv ) qkd protocols based on optical coherent detection ( such as homodyne or heterodyne detection ) have been demonstrated as useful solutions for secure key distribution @xcite .",
    "while the spd used in dv qkd may output a `` no - detection '' event , the homodyne ( or heterodyne ) detector used in cv qkd always yields a measurement result regardless of channel loss .",
    "this suggests the `` post - selection '' strategy discussed in the previous section , where the adversaries report a measurement result only when they happen to use a `` good '' measurement basis , can not be applied in cv pbqc protocols based on coherent detection .",
    "another distinct advantage of the cv protocol is that the local oscillator ( lo ) employed in coherent detection acts as a `` mode selector '' which can suppress broadband noise photons effectively @xcite .",
    "this feature is especially appealing in free - space quantum communication systems where the background noise due to ambient light is high .",
    "one of the most successful cv qkd protocols is the gaussian - modulated - coherent - state ( gmcs ) qkd @xcite . in this protocol , alice draws two random numbers , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , from a set of gaussian random numbers , and sends a coherent state @xmath86 to bob .",

    "can we improve the performance of pbqc by using squeezed states ?",

    "this could explain why pbqc protocols based on the bb84 or gmcs encoding schemes can not go beyond the @xmath2 db loss limit .    a natural way to go beyond",
    "the above @xmath2 db limit is to use multiple encoding bases .",
    "our discussion showed that by introducing the decoy state idea , an extended bb84-type pbqc protocol implemented with a weak coherent source and realistic spds could tolerate a total loss of @xmath0 db when the intrinsic qber is @xmath115 .",

    "later on , @xmath6 measures both the @xmath117-quadrature and @xmath5-quadrature of mode @xmath91 by performing a conjugate homodyne detection . since measurements performed by @xmath3 and @xmath6 commute with each other",
