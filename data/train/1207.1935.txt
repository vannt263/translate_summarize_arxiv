    "fig : bodies_around ] also shows the location of @xmath49 as a function of the radius of bodies .",
    "the location of @xmath49 for small bodies is close to 9au , because @xmath38 and @xmath39 are strongly damped by gas drag .",
    "although the location of @xmath49 moves inward for a massive embryo because of its strong stirring , the feeding zone of the embryo , of which the width is given by 10 times hill radii of the embryo @xcite , is so wide that the embryo can accrete kilometer - sized or smaller bodies .",

    "therefore , the assumption of @xmath50 is valid to investigate embryo grow at the pressure maximum .",
    "the location of the pressure maximum depends on the turbulent strength , @xmath20 value . magneto - rotational instability may cause turbulence in the disk ; its activity depends on an ionization degree and the strength of magnetic field . because of the low ionization degree , a magnetically decoupled midplane dead zone emerges at @xmath51au @xcite , can produce a sufficient optical depth . ] . in the dead zone",
    ", the @xmath20 value is expected to be as low as @xmath52@xmath53 if the net vertical magnetic field is weak enough @xcite ; the pressure maximum is then located at around 9au . for larger @xmath54 , the pressure maximum moves to about 7au .",
    "however , the behavior of bodies is similar ; bodies smaller than 110 km halt inside the feeding zone of an embryo formed at the pressure maximum and thereby these bodies contribute to the embryo growth .",
    "therefore , the location of pressure maximum ( or choosing @xmath20 value ) insignificantly affects the saturn core formation .",
    "we thus fix the pressure maximum at 9au in the following .",
    "we introduce a disk model for the initial surface mass density of solids @xmath55 and gas @xmath56 such that @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are , respectively , the solid and gas surface densities at 9au in the minimum - mass solar nebula ( mmsn ) model @xcite .",
    "we vary scaling factors @xmath60 and @xmath61 to find the conditions for saturn core formation .",
    "solid surface density evolves in the simulation but gas density is set to be constant with time .",
    "we consider the disks with @xmath62 which are small enough for jupiter to reside at the current position without significant type ii migration and large enough to form cores for jupiter and saturn @xcite .",
    "we consider a disk from 8.6au to 35au .",
    "the disk is divided into 14 annuli whose widths are given by 0.1 times the distance from the annulus center to the sun .",
    "the innermost annulus centered at @xmath63 is assumed to be the pressure maximum zone . as shown in section [ sc : pm ] ,",
    "kilometer - sized or smaller bodies stay in the feeding zone of an embryo residing at the pressure maximum . in the mmsn disk , drift time required for larger bodies to go out of the feeding zone of an embryo with mass @xmath64",
    "is longer than the formation timescale of saturn s core , 1@xmath65 years , if the bodies are larger than about 30 km . for bodies with intermediate sizes ,",
    "the drift time is longer than their collisional fragmentation timescale @xcite .",
    "therefore , we ignore radial drift of bodies in the innermost annulus ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath66 and @xmath10 are taken from those at the radial center of each annulus , given by equation  ( [ eq : sigma_gas ] ) and @xmath67 except for the innermost annulus that has @xmath9 .",
    "each annulus has a lot of mass bins to calculate the evolution of the mass distribution of bodies via collisional coagulation and fragmentation among bodies .",
    "collisional outcomes are assumed to be scaled by the dimensionless impact energy @xmath68 according to the simple model that @xcite and @xcite constructed consistently with laboratory experiments and collisional simulations , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the collider masses , @xmath71 is the collisional velocity between the colliders and @xmath72 is the specific energy needed to eject half of the total mass of the colliders .",
    "the collisional cross sections of bodies depend on their random velocities determined by @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "since the stirring of large bodies increases the velocities , the mass distribution of bodies affects the velocity evolution .",
    "therefore , we calculate the mass and velocity evolution simultaneously using the collision rates @xcite and the velocity evolution rates due to mutual interaction of bodies @xcite and due to gas drag @xcite . with a use of an upwind scheme , we calculate radial transport of bodies due to radial drift given by equation  ( [ eq : vd_final ] ) except for the innermost annulus .",
    "in addition , we include the enhancement of collisions with embryos due to their tenuous atmospheres and due to gas drag for small bodies with @xmath73 , where @xmath74 corresponds to several tens centimeter in radius at 9au .",
    "we apply the atmospheric enhancement modeled by @xcite with the grain depletion factor @xmath75 and the collision rate between embryos and small bodies with @xmath76 , given by @xcite . for the ormel & klahr model",
    ", we adopt the headwind velocity of gas to an embryo as @xmath77 , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are , respectively , eccentricity and inclination of the embryo .",
    "since small bodies are strongly coupled with gas flow , the model of ormel & klahr gives a very long timescale for collisions between very small bodies and embryos .",
    "in addition , because the collisional cascade caused by embryo growth stalls at a body size of about 110 m , the total mass of smaller bodies is negligible @xcite .",
    "therefore , we neglect bodies with radius smaller than @xmath80 , where @xmath81 cm in our simulation .",
    "indeed , embryo growth is independent of @xmath80 if @xmath82 cm .",
    "we perform simulations for core formation and growth starting from a monodisperse mass population of planetesimals of mass @xmath83 and radius @xmath84 with @xmath85 . in fig .  [",

    "collisional coagulation of planetesimals produces a small number of large bodies , planetary embryos .",
    "as embryos grow via the accretion of a swarm of planetesimals , massive embryos stir planetesimals and collisional fragmentation among planetesimals turns planetesimals into small fragments . since gas drag suppresses the random motions of very small bodies , fragmentation by collisions among such small bodies no longer occurs . the grinding down of bodies through collisions halts at @xmath89 m , where bodies accumulate ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : zerovd_cumnum ] ) .",
    "the mass distribution is given by three discrete components that are the largest bodies ( planetary embryos ) , initial sized or slightly larger bodies ( planetesimals ) , and small bodies with 1100 m .",
    "the gas drag coefficient @xmath33 is constant for kilometer - sized or larger bodies but it increases with decreasing size in the stokes regime , given by @xmath90 @xcite . here , @xmath91 is the mean free path of gas molecular with @xmath92 .",
    "the fragments accumulating at 1100 m are controlled by the stokes drag .",
    "the equilibrium eccentricity @xmath93 in the stokes regime is estimated as @xcite @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the reduced hill radius of an embryo with mass @xmath96 , @xmath97 is the dimensionless stirring rate for @xmath98 , and @xmath99 is the separation of embryos divided by their mutual hill radius . since @xmath100 in the stokes regime , @xmath101 is independent of @xmath31 ; the eccentricity is the same as that in the case @xmath102 .",
    "when a body of mass @xmath30 collides with a similar - sized body , the impact energy is given by @xmath103 . if the energy is much smaller than @xmath104 , the collision no longer produces significant fragments .",
    "the collisional cascade stalls around @xmath105 with a constant @xmath106 and small bodies accumulate around the radius satisfying the condition , which is obtained from the condition and equation ( [ eq : eeq ] ) as @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the disk midplane temperature and the value of @xmath109 for a body of radius @xmath110 is applied @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xmath111 is consistent with the result of simulations for @xmath106 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : zerovd_cumnum ] ) .",
    "interestingly , @xmath111 is independent of @xmath10 and @xmath5 because gas drag is determined in the stokes regime .",
    "in addition , @xmath112 is smaller than @xmath113 , resulting in a very large accretion rate of the fragments onto an embryo @xcite .",
    "[ fig : zerovd_s1 ] shows the evolution of embryo masses at 9au for the mmsn disk with @xmath114 km and 10 km .",
    "embryos initially grow exponentially with time and the growth time scale is proportional to @xmath115 @xcite , which is called runaway growth .",
    "massive embryos formed by the runaway growth stir remnant planetesimals and then slower , oligarchic growth starts for embryos larger than @xmath116 .",
    "such massive embryos then activate collisional fragmentation of planetesimals .",
    "the very low @xmath38 and @xmath39 of the small resulting fragments damped by strong gas drag tend to accelerate the embryo growth . on the other hand",
    ", the gas drag also leads to the radial drift of the fragments , which generally limits the embryo growth @xcite .",
    "however , near the pressure maximum due to gap opening by jupiter , embryos effectively accrete such fragments without the loss of the fragments . in fig .  [",
    "fig : zerovd_s1 ] , the embryo growth starts being accelerated at @xmath117 ( at about @xmath118 years for @xmath86 km and at about @xmath119 years for @xmath120 km ) , because fragment production becomes efficient at such an embryo mass . at @xmath121 ,",
    "the acceleration slows down due to depletion of the total amount of surrounding bodies by the embryo accretion .",
    "nevertheless , the embryo keeps growing beyond the `` isolation mass '' , which is several earth masses for the mmsn model , because fragments produced in outer annuli drift into the region at @xmath122au .",
    "eventually , an embryo reaches 10 earth masses in @xmath123 years for @xmath86 km , while the embryo mass is about an earth mass in @xmath124 years for @xmath120 km .",
    "in the oligarchic growth of embryos , embryos have orbital separations of 10 hill radii of themselves @xcite . since 10 hill radii of an embryo with @xmath125 at 9au , about 2au , is larger than the pressure maximum region ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bodies_around ] ) , only an embryo larger than @xmath125 can be formed in the pressure maximum . in case that the pressure maximum does not emerge ( dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : zerovd_s1 ] ) , embryo growth is not so rapid and stalls at about @xmath126 , because surrounding planetesimals are lost due to combination of planetesimal fragmentation with the radial drift of resulting fragments ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since there is no pressure maximum in the outer disk , embryos beyond 10au can not become larger than a body of about mars mass .",
    "meanwhile the fragmentation of planetesimals and the ensuing radial drift of resultant fragments remove the solid mass reservoir in the outer disk , which facilitates the formation of a large enough embryo in the pressure - maximum region .",
    "although a core can keep growing at the pressure maximum , the core is required to reach @xmath127 within several myrs for the formation of saturn . for @xmath128 km",
    ", an mmsn disk ( @xmath129 ) can not produce a core with 10 earth masses in several million years ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : zerovd_s1 ] ) .",
    "fragment production from large planetesimals is ineffective because of large @xmath72 and occasional collisions among them , which delays embryo growth via fragment accretion . a large solid surface density ( @xmath130 ) that increases fragment production is necessary for planetesimals with larger @xmath84 to form a massive core in several million years .",
    "a core can reach 10 earth masses in a disk with @xmath131 for @xmath132 km and with @xmath133 for @xmath134 km ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : zerovd_mix ] ) .",
    "note that the growth of cores is almost independent of @xmath61 , because fragments with @xmath111 contributing most to the growth are controlled by stokes drag ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper , we have taken the size of initial planetesimals as a free parameter .",
    "the size depends on the formation mechanisms of planetesimals .",
    "if planetesimals are formed via self - gravitational instability in a thin dust layer @xcite or of dust accumulated in the structure of disk turbulence @xcite , resulting planetesimals are 10 km or larger . on the other hand ,",
    "collisional coagulation of fluffy dust is possible to produce planetesimals overcoming an obstacle of rapid radial drift at @xmath135 @xcite ; the resulting planetesimals may be smaller .",
    "in addition , bodies in a significant amount drift from the outer disk during the collisional growth of fluffy dust and such drifting dust increases the solid surface density form mmsn to about @xmath136mmsn inside @xmath89au @xcite .",
    "therefore , we should address the history of saturn core formation including planetesimal formation .",
    "a planetary embryo born at the pressure maximum migrates due to interaction with the surrounding gas disk ( type i ) .",
    "the time required to go through half the width of the embryo s feeding zone due to type i migration is longer than the growth time of the embryo unless the embryo exceeds @xmath137 @xcite .",
    "the type i migration rate of an embryo with mass @xmath96 at distance @xmath8 is given by @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is a factor that is determined by @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "if horseshoe torques are fully saturated , @xmath142 in a locally isothermal disk and @xmath143 in an adiabatic disk @xcite . in the outer disk where we assume @xmath144 and @xmath145 ,",
    "type i migration is inward due to a negative value of @xmath139 , while outward migration occurs around the gap opened by jupiter where the radial @xmath11 slope has a large positive value",
    ". therefore type i migration stalls at a certain distance under the density profile shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bodies_around ] ; the location of zero migration is at 8.6au in the locally isothermal disk and at 9.1au in the adiabatic disk .",
    "since the location is near the pressure maximum , such a large embryo , which has a wide feeding zone , can grow via the accretion of bodies accumulating at around the pressure maximum .",
    "note that if the torques are fully unsaturated , @xmath146 in the locally isothermal disk and @xmath147 in the adiabatic disk @xcite .",
    "then , @xmath139 is positive ( outward migration ) if @xmath148 has a large value . in the optically thick regions ( inner disks or massive disks ) where viscous heating is more dominant than irradiation",
    ", @xmath148 has a relatively large value .",
    "however , in the outer regions ( @xmath122au ) of moderate disks with @xmath62 that we are concerned with , it is likely that the disk temperature is determined by irradiation rather than viscous heating and that @xmath148 has a relatively small value ( @xmath149 ) .",
    "then , for @xmath150@xmath151 , type i migration is inward ( @xmath152 ) and the argument of the migration trap is still applicable .",
    "furthermore , the torque saturation is likely in the disk of interest .",
    "the saturation is prevented only if the horseshoe liberation time is comparable to the diffusion / thermal diffusion timescale across the horseshoe width @xcite and if an embryo has a low enough eccentricity @xcite .",
    "the embryos resulting form our simulations have eccentricities larger than 0.01 . therefore the condition for type i migration in the outer disk where saturn s core forms is most likely to result in inward migration , except in the vicinity of the gap .",
    "consequently , type i migration does not inhibit the fast formation of saturn s core but rather strengthens it .",
    "once a core exceeds a critical core mass , the core has no longer a static atmosphere and rapid gas accretion starts to form a gas giant .",
    "interior modeling of jupiter and saturn suggests that jupiter s core mass is smaller than @xmath125 , while saturn s core is larger than @xmath153 @xcite .",
    "since heating by the accretion of small bodies onto a core stabilises the atmosphere , the critical core mass becomes large for a fast growth core ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "traditional scenarios , in which the core growth is 510 times slower for saturn than for jupiter , can not explain the estimate of core masses of jupiter and saturn .",
    "however , saturn core grows rapidly at the pressure maximum caused by jupiter s gap opening .",
    "since the growth is possible to be faster for saturn than for jupiter , the resulting core masses of jupiter and saturn may be consistent with those derived form the interior modeling .",
    "since the core of saturn is estimated to be larger than @xmath154 @xcite , saturn should be formed via core accretion .",
    "we have shown that if jupiter has already been completed and opened a gap in the disk , the massive core of saturn has rapidly formed from kilometer sized planetesimals in an mmsn disk or from larger planetesimals in a disk with a larger amount of planetesimals . on the other hand , since small initial planetesimals are quickly removed by combination of fragmentation with gas drag , the core of jupiter is likely to have formed from large initial planetesimals with @xmath155 km at around 5au in a @xmath156mmsn disk @xcite .",
    "jupiter is possible to form earlier than saturn core formation , if either ( 1 ) the solar nebula is as massive as self - gravitational instability occurs , ( 2 ) pressure maxima originally exist in the solar nebula , or ( 3 ) planetesimals of size 100 km are born around 5au in a massive disk .",
    "all the cases are consistent with the sequential formation of saturn .",
    "after the gas accretion , saturn might open up another gap in the disk , resulting in the emergence of an additional pressure maximum .",
    "neptune and uranus mainly consist of ice with more than @xmath125 covered with tenuous atmospheres . near the pressure maximum , such massive icy planets can be formed .",
    "fragments produced in the outer disk accumulate within about the width of the disk scale height near the pressure maximum but the feeding zone of such a massive planet is wider than the scale height ; hence only one planet can be produced .",
    "meanwhile , the orbital eccentricity distribution of kuiper belt objects in the 3:2 mean - motion resonance with neptune suggests that neptune migrated outward from around 20au to the current position @xcite .",
    "neptune was therefore expected to have formed at the pressure maximum and to have then migrated outward due to interaction with the outer planetesimal disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "note that torques from interaction with gas that cause type i migration suppress the planetesimal - driven migration .",
    "since saturn should form in gas with a high density , high gas - to - solid surface densities render type i migration stronger compared to the planetesimal - driven migration .",
    "therefore , the planetesimal - driven migration is negligible for the saturn formation .",
    "however , neptune plausibly migrated outward through interactions with planetesimals because of a low gas density .",
    "uranus might then have formed at around the pressure maximum caused by saturn , where fragments produced from remnant planetesimals that induce the neptune migration accumulate .",
    "therefore , we should also address uranus and neptune formation after saturn s formation .",
    "we have investigated the core formation of saturn at the pressure maximum caused by jupiter s gap opening in the solar nebula .",
    "small particles feel strong gas drag and drift radially . the loss of bodies due to the drift stalls embryo growth before embryos reach the critical core mass @xcite .",
    "although bodies stirred by a large embryo can drift from the pressure maximum , the drift halts near the pressure maximum due to positive radial slope of gas pressure ; hence an embryo at the pressure maximum effectively grows without loss of surrounding bodies ( see section [ sc : pm ] ) .",
    "starting from monodisperse planetesimals , planetary embryos are generated via collisional evolution and stir remnant planetesimals , resulting in fragmentation of planetesimals .",
    "fragments collide with each other and they accumulate at a radius @xmath111 , given by equation  ( [ eq : rf ] ) .",
    "the random velocity of bodies with @xmath111 is well damped by gas drag ; thereby embryos rapidly accrete such bodies .",
    "fragments produced in the outer disk move to the pressure maximum , which contribute to further embryo growth . due to the rapid accretion ,",
    "a core as massive as 10 earth masses forms in several million years , for kilometer - sized initial planetesimals in an mmsn disk , while the core formation needs a disk with 3 times larger solid surface density for 10 km planetesimals and with 10 times solid surface density for 100 km planetesimals .",
    "the growth is almost independent of gas density .",
    "since the rapid formation in a disk with moderate mass is consistent with insignificant type ii migration of jupiter and larger core of saturn than that of jupiter , saturn s core may have formed in the pressure maximum after jupiter opened up a gap in the solar nebula .",

    "<S> a core formed via planetesimal accretion induces the fragmentation of surrounding planetesimals , which generally inhibits further growth of the core by removal of the resulting fragments due to radial drift caused by gas drag . </S>",
    "<S> however , the emergence of the pressure maximum halts the drift of the fragments , while their orbital eccentricities and inclinations are efficiently damped by gas drag . as a result , the core of saturn rapidly grows via accretion of the fragments near the pressure maximum . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that in the minimum - mass solar nebula , kilometer sized planetesimals can produce a core exceeding 10 earth masses within two million years . since jupiter may not have undergone significant type ii inward migration , it is likely that jupiter s formation was completed when the local disk mass has already decayed to a value comparable to or less than jovian mass . </S>",
    "<S> the expected rapid growth of saturn s core on a timescale comparable to or shorter than observationally inferred disk lifetime enables saturn to acquire the current amount of envelope gas before the disk gas is completely depleted . the high heat energy release rate onto the core surface due to the rapid accretion of the fragments delays onset of runaway gas accretion until the core mass becomes somewhat larger than that of jupiter , which is consistent with the estimate based on interior modeling . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the rapid formation of saturn induced by gap opening of jupiter can account for the formation of multiple gas giants ( jupiter and saturn ) without significant inward migration and larger core mass of saturn than that of jupiter . </S>"
