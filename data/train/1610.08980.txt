    "in the last few years there has been a renewed interest in the study of extended and low surface brightness galaxies @xcite .",
    "galaxies with the following characteristics : @xmath924 mag arcsec@xmath4 and @xmath101.5 kpc3.2at the distance of the coma galaxy cluster .",
    "this angular size is roughly the size of the pixel ( 2.8 ) of the dragonfly lens array ( the telescope first used to define this galaxy population ; * ? ? ?",
    "] have been coined ultra diffuse galaxies ( udgs ) by @xcite .",
    "these objects have typical stellar masses around 10@xmath7 m@xmath8 and relatively red ( g - i@xmath20.8 ) colors .",
    "there has been a intense debate about the ultimate nature of these galaxies .",
    "for instance , for some udgs @xcite suggest the intriguing hypothesis that these galaxies could be failed milky way - like objects ( l@xmath11 ) . on the other hand , using their population of globular clusters , @xcite support the idea that these are failed large magellanic cloud - like galaxies ( see also , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "both theoretically and observationally , there is an increasing agreement towards the idea that the vast majority of udgs are dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "the extremely low surface brightness of these galaxies makes it almost impossible to measure their distance using spectroscopic redshifts ( exceptions being df44 & vcc1287 ) . for this reason ,",
    "these galaxies have been explored in galaxy clusters , where the distance to the udgs is inferred by their proximity to the massive structure .",
    "this selection effect towards galaxy clusters could affect our understanding of the nature of these galaxies .",
    "in fact , not all the known udgs are in galaxy clusters with some already found outside these structures .",
    "at least one udg is confirmed spectroscopically @xcite , and a large number of candidates are shown in @xcite .",
    "these last authors , exploring a wide area of 8@xmath128 mpc around the abell168 cluster of galaxies , find udgs both in the cluster and in the large scale structure surrounding this massive object .",
    "having established the existence of udgs both inside and outside clusters , the question which arises is whether these objects are formed outside the clusters and are later on aggregated to them through the infall of galaxy groups .",
    "answering this question could give us important hints on the formation mechanisms of udgs .",
    "in this paper we explore this scenario .",
    "to achieve our goal , we have probed the presence of udgs in a number of well known groups of galaxies located in the deep stripe82 survey @xcite .",
    "we benefit from the careful reduction of this dataset ( the iac stripe82 legacy survey ) performed by @xcite . among the different groups available in the iac stripe82 legacy survey ,",
    "we have selected hickson compact groups ( hcgs ) @xcite .",
    "these are especially useful for our analysis as they are isolated groups by definition .",
    "consequently , the spatial association of udgs presented in the field of view with these objects is more straightforward .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the dataset and in section 3 we explain the criteria for selecting udgs .",
    "section 4 describes how udgs can be grouped into two differentiated samples according to their colour characteristics and stellar population properties . in section 5",
    "we present an evolutionary scenario linking the properties of the blue and red populations of udgs .",
    "section 6 shows how the abundance of udgs is tightly correlated with the halo mass of the structure where they are embedded . finally , we discuss our results in section 7 .",
    "we adopt the following cosmology ( @xmath13=0.3 , @xmath14=0.7 and h@xmath15=70 km s@xmath16 mpc@xmath16 ) .",
    "we use the ab - magnitude system in this work .",
    "the images used in this work are based on the iac stripe 82 legacy survey @xcite .",
    "this survey consists of a new coaddition of the sdss stripe82 data , carefully stacked to preserve the faintest surface brightness structures .",
    "the pixel scale of these images is the same than regular sdss data , i.e. 0.396 arcsec .",
    "the average seeing of our dataset is around 1 arcsec . to conduct this work",
    ", we use the rectified images of the survey . in these images , many residuals of the stacking process have been removed and the sky level has been measured very precisely .",
    "this produces high - quality and homogenized deep images .",
    "the mean limiting surface brightness of our dataset ( 3@xmath17 ; 10@xmath1210 arcsec boxes ) are 29.1 , 28.6 and 28.1 mag arcsec@xmath4 for the _ g _ , _ r _ and _ i _ bands respectively .",
    "this is @xmath21.2 mag deeper than the dragonfly images used to explore udgs @xcite and similar to @xcite .",
    "galaxy groups are gravitationally bound structures with typical values of m@xmath18@xmath210@xmath19m@xmath20 and r@xmath18@xmath2500 kpc .",
    "the groups we explore here are : hcg07 ( r.a.=9.816 , dec.=+0.888 , z=0.0141 ) , hcg25 ( r.a.=50.182 , dec.=-01.052 , z=0.0212 ) and hcg98 ( r.a.=358.55 , dec.=+0.37 , z=0.0266 ) .",
    "hcgs are defined based on their number of bright galaxy members ( @xmath214 ) within some specific magnitude range . together with the number of bright galaxies , hcgs are also defined on the basis of criteria of isolation and compactness , which make them dense galactic associations .",
    "these structures can be as dense as the centers of rich clusters , but with modest velocity dispersions .",
    "they are expected to be dynamically dominated by dark matter .",
    "x - ray emission @xcite and intragroup diffuse light ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been detected in these objects , confirming their spatial association and intense dynamic activity in these structures .",
    "we assume a spatial scale of 0.288 kpc / arcsec for hcg07 , 0.429 kpc / arcsec for hcg25 and 0.535 kpc / arcsec for hcg98 .    to explore our groups ,",
    "we have created wide field imaging mosaics using the software swarp @xcite .",
    "this allow us to combine different images from the iac stripe82 project and increase the search area . for the hcg07 group , we explore the following area 9.5@xmath22r.a.(deg)@xmath2210.5 and 0.25@xmath22@xmath23@xmath221.25 equivalent to 1.04@xmath121.04 mpc at the group distance . for hcg25 , the area probed is 49.5@xmath22r.a.(deg)@xmath2250.5 and -1.25@xmath22@xmath23@xmath22 - 0.75 , i.e. 1.54@xmath120.77 mpc ( in this case the area is limited in declination by the spatial coverage of the stripe82 survey ) .",
    "finally , for hcg98 , the area used is 358@xmath22r.a.(deg)@xmath22359 and -0.25@xmath22@xmath23@xmath220.75 equivalent to 1.93@xmath121.93 mpc .",
    "a first list of galaxy candidates in our mosaics was done using sextractor .",
    "we require all our sources to be detected simultaneously in the @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 bands . to remove as much as possible contamination from point sources , all our targets have a stellarity factor below 0.2 and a minimum area of 15 pixels ( @xmath22.35 arcsec@xmath27 ) .",
    "in addition , we require that the selected sources satisfy the following colour cuts : _ _ g - r__@xmath221.4 and _ _ g - i__@xmath221.8 . these colour criteria remove a large number of targets that have colours not representative of nearby populations ( i.e. background contamination ) . after applying these restrictions",
    ", we reduce our initial sample to @xmath215000 galaxies / deg@xmath27 .",
    "all the sources in the previous sample were fitted using a single srsic model @xcite .",
    "the fitting code used was imfit @xcite .",
    "the srsic models were convolved with the psf of the image .",
    "the iac stripe82 legacy survey provides a psf representative of the local conditions of the image .",
    "each piece of the stripe82 iac survey ( 0.5@xmath120.5 deg ) has its own psf .",
    "we use as input parameters for imfit , the spatial coordinates of the source , the position angle and the effective radius retrieved from the previous sextractor run . in addition , we mask the closest sources to the target under study .    to avoid missing potential udgs sources , we conduct the following sanity checks to the outputs of our model fitting .",
    "any time imfit produces structural parameters representative of a bad fit ( like srsic index close to 0 or very large r@xmath28 ) or in cases where the magnitude of the model is different from the magnitude obtained for sextractor by more than 1 mag , then we restart the imfit modeling again with a different random input seeds and slightly different masking configurations .",
    "this process is repeated until a robust solution is reached .",
    "the structural parameters obtained from the imfit srsic fit are : position angle , ellipticity , srsic index @xmath29 , effective radius ( along the semimajor axis ) r@xmath30 and the global magnitude in each filter .",
    "once the structural parameters of all galaxies in our data are determined , we select those with r@xmath31 1.3 kpc ( in the g - band ) and observed @xmath923.5 mag / arcsec@xmath32 .",
    "this provides around 40 candidates for udg galaxies",
    ". however , an important portion of these sources are artifacts produced by bad identification of objects in the vicinity of bright stars or galaxies .",
    "therefore , we visually explored all the udg candidates and we reject all the false positives .",
    "after this visual inspection we end up with a final sample of 11 galaxies . additionally , for this clean sample , we double check their structural parameters by masking , if necessary , any close or overlapping source to the target that were not masked in the automatic masking process . as a last step ,",
    "we obtain the extinction values for each galaxy from @xcite using their spatial coordinates and we correct their magnitudes .",

    "some of our galaxies , especially the bluer ones , are detected in the _ u _ band as well .",

    "both approaches provide similar stellar masses for the two populations .",
    "the clumpy appearance of the blue udgs suggests that the colours ( and consequently , the stellar population properties ) of these galaxies can be heavily affected by these knots of intense star formation . in this sense , it is worth exploring whether the stellar masses of the blue udgs would change by using the colours of the central part ( r@xmath224 arcsec ) of these objects , where the star formation is less prominent .",

    "we obtain a mean stellar mass for the blue udgs of @xmath21.4@xmath1210@xmath7m@xmath20 , in good agreement with all the previous estimates .",
    "once the stellar masses of our udgs are estimated , we focus our attention on the ages and metallicities of the two populations of udgs . having only two colours",
    ", the expected degeneracy between the age and the metallicity is very high .",

    "note that the gap present around 1.2 gyr in the age - metallicity map corresponds to the transition from the light contribution of agb to rgb stars .    finally , the sample of blue udgs present the following mean colours : _ _ g - r__=0.30@xmath380.03 and _ _ r - i__=0.15@xmath380.03 .",
    "these bluer colours imply that t(gyr)@xmath221 gyr ( see fig .",

    "in this section we explore the following evolutionary scenario : red udgs are the outcome of the group environmental processing of the blue udgs located in their outskirts . in other words ,",
    "blue udgs eventually infall into the group s core where their gas is removed by ram pressure or tidal stripping and they become red udgs with time . in this process , their stellar population gets redder and older but their metallicity should not change . during this process",
    "it is likely that the udgs lose part of their stellar mass ( decreasing their effective radii ) and become more roundish .",
    "is this evolutionary scenario compatible with our observations ? to start with , blue udgs are , in fact , systematically located in the outskirts of the groups ( see fig . [",
    "fig : dist ] ) . in this sense",
    ", the star formation activity of the udgs seems to be strongly related to the location of these galaxies within the dark matter halo of the group .",
    "moreover , the size and stellar mass of the red udgs are smaller than the blue udgs .",
    "the red udgs are also roundish .",
    "we can try to quantify a little bit more the above evolutionary scenario by comparing the stellar population properties of blue and red udgs with the expected theoretical transformation for dwarf galaxies within group environments .",
    "@xcite have studied the environmental processing of dwarf galaxies infalling into groups ( 10@xmath19m@xmath20 ) . according to these authors ,",
    "the dwarf galaxies become gas poor 6 gyr after first infall .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that these simulations are for dwarf galaxies which are more massive ( 10@xmath56m@xmath20 ) than our blue udgs ( 10@xmath7m@xmath20 ) .",
    "having said that , it is reasonable then to explore whether a passive evolution of our blue udgs will resemble the properties of our red udgs .",
    "we conduct such an exercise in fig .",

    ", we calculate the passive evolution of the colours of the blue ( and the core of the blue ) udgs for a fixed metallicity .",
    "we select [ fe / h]=-1.31 . once we have selected a metallicity , it is straightforward to add a colour increase to the observed colours of the blue udgs after a given amount of time . in our case",

    "the location on this map of the average udg in the abell 168 cluster and its surrounding is also shown @xcite .",
    "in addition , we include also the location of the galaxy vcc1287 @xcite .",
    "we add these extra points as these are the only studies ( besides this ) with a characterization of udgs in 3 optical bands .",
    "the scatter of the red udgs in this colour - colour map is larger due to the higher photometric uncertainties at measuring the colours of these fainter objects .",
    "it is worth noting how , after 6 gyr of passive evolution , the location of the blue ( and particularly their cores ) are in nice agreement with the location of the red udgs .",
    "it is important to stress that some of our galaxies ( like udg - b4 ) have some properties in between the red and the blue population .",
    "reinforcing the idea that both populations are connected .",
    "once the evolution in the colour - colour map of the blue udgs has been explored , it is worth taking a look to the change of the surface brightness profiles of these objects assuming a passive evolution .",
    "this is , of course , an oversimplification of the real scenario .",
    "in fact , it is expected that these infalling dwarf galaxies will have some stellar mass loss during the infall process to the group .",
    "an eventual stellar mass loss will produce a decrease in their effective radius ( as most of the mass loss will be likely produced in the outskirts of these objects ) .",
    "the right column ( upper panel ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] shows the observed surface brightness profiles of both blue and red udgs .",
    "the passive evolution of the blue udgs is modeled in the lower panel of the same figure . as can be seen , after 6 gyr of passive evolution all the current blue udgs will be classified as regular udgs ( i.e. large objects with @xmath924 mag arcsec@xmath4 ) . as the srsic index of both blue and red udgs",
    "are very similar ( n@xmath10.8 ) , a passive transformation of the blue population will resemble the red population .",
    "however , despite the similar appearance of the evolved blue udgs in relation to the red udgs , some of the evolved blue udgs show an excess of light in their outer regions compared to the red population .",
    "this is as expected considering that : a ) we have not modeled any mass loss in the profiles of the blue udgs and b ) the profiles of the blue udgs are affected by the presence of intense star forming regions in the outer parts .",
    "considering that these star forming regions are relevant in light but not as much in mass , the time evolution of the surface brightness profiles of the blue galaxies in their outer regions will approximate the shape of the red population . summarizing , under the hypothesis that the blue udgs will passively evolve as the result of their infall into the group s gravitational potential , the global colour and shape properties will be close to the red udg population , making a scenario linking the two type galaxies plausible .",
    "have shown that there is a tight correlation between the number of udgs in a given cluster and the mass of the cluster as parameterized by m@xmath18 . according to that work , the abundance of udgs increases almost proportionally to the mass of the cluster where they are embedded .",
    "have studied such relation for clusters with m@xmath18 @xmath5710@xmath58m@xmath20 . in this work ,",
    "we want to probe where that relation also holds for less massive gravitationally bound systems . to do this task , we have compiled in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmas ] the number of udgs observed in different works as a function of their host velocity dispersion and m@xmath18 .",
    "the velocity dispersion and m@xmath18 are obtained from different works . for the clusters provided by",
    ", we use their m@xmath18 and the velocity dispersion from . for the abell 168 cluster and the ugc842 group presented in @xcite",
    ", we use as sources for their velocity dispersions : @xcite ( for the cluster ) and @xcite ( for the group ) . for the coma cluster @xcite",
    ", the velocity dispersion was taken from @xcite , whereas for the fornax cluster @xcite the velocity dispersion is obtained from @xcite .",
    "finally , for the groups presented in this paper , we have used the velocity dispersions given by .",
    "once we have the velocity dispersions , we follow @xcite to get m@xmath18 for these structures .    fig . [",
    "fig : sigmas ] shows that the tight correlation between the abundance of udgs and the halo mass of the structures where they are located extend also towards lower masses than those originally explored by .",
    "we have fitted our relations assuming a power law , as it was done by : n@xmath59@xmath60 and n@xmath59m@xmath18@xmath61 .",
    "we find the following values : @xmath62=2.43@xmath380.14 and @xmath63=0.85@xmath380.05 . in our plot of m@xmath18 ,",
    "the estimation of this quantity comes from two different sources , however , our results remain basically the same ( @xmath63=0.87@xmath380.05 ) if we use the methodology of @xcite for estimating m@xmath18 for all the structures .",
    "interestingly , found a value for @xmath63=0.93@xmath380.16 in agreement ( within the error bars ) with the expanded mass sample we have explored here .",
    "determining the exponent @xmath63 is key for understanding in which structures the udgs are formed with higher efficiency .",
    "we discuss the implication of our finding in the next section .",
    "in this paper , we have suggested an evolutionary scenario where present - day udgs are the result of the environmental transformation ( mainly by gas stripping ) of infalling low surface brightness dwarf galaxies ( of similar stellar mass and structural parameters ) into the groups and clusters gravitational potential .",
    "we want to expand such discussion further and explore which kind of structures ( groups or clusters ) are more favorable for the formation of udgs .",
    "initially , clusters have been considered the natural place for finding udgs , however , there is increasing evidence ( first noted by @xcite and recently by @xcite ; see also : ) that udgs are also found outside clusters .",
    "the existence of udgs in the field has been also motivated theoretically by @xcite . as there is a tight correlation between the abundance of udgs and the mass of the host structures where they are located",
    ", it is worth exploring what can be learned from this relation .",
    "the relation between the abundance of udgs and m@xmath18 is characterized by a power - law with an exponent slightly lower than 1 , i.e. @xmath63=0.85@xmath380.05 . if @xmath63 were larger than 1 , the udgs will be formed preferentially in clusters .",
    "let s expand on this . under the assumption",
    "( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that clusters were purely the result of merging of smaller sub - units ( i.e. groups of galaxies ) , the abundance of udgs will be never larger ( i.e. @xmath63@xmath11 ) than the contribution of udgs accreted through the infalling of groups to the cluster . consequently , if observations were shown that @xmath63@xmath11 this will be a strong argument favouring the preferential ( in - situ ) formation of udgs in clusters of galaxies .",
    "if @xmath63@xmath221 , however , the observing result is not straightforward to interpret . naively , one could understand that if @xmath63@xmath221 this means that udgs are form preferentially in groups .",
    "as groups are infalling into clusters , one would expect that some udgs could be disrupted during the accretion process and for that cause @xmath63@xmath641 .",
    "@xmath63@xmath221 could be also expected if udgs are more easily destroyed in clusters than in groups over time .",
    "for this reason , if @xmath63@xmath221 one can not firmly conclude that udgs are form preferentially in groups than in clusters .",
    "nonetheless , the observational result is not in contradiction with such hypothesis .",
    "another interesting issue to explore is why the relation between the abundance of udgs and @xmath17 is so tight ( pearson correlation coefficient r=0.964 ) .",
    "this is not at all expected as the number of udgs in a given structure is a function of the depth of the survey used to detect these objects and the background and foreground contamination .",
    "the limiting surface brightness of the different surveys presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmas ] are : 29.2 mag / arcsec@xmath32 ( 3@xmath17 , 10@xmath1210 arcsec in g - band ; @xcite ) , 28.8 - 29.2 mag / arcsec@xmath32 ( 3@xmath17 , 10@xmath1210 arcsec in r - band ; @xcite ) , 28.9 mag / arcsec@xmath32 ( 3@xmath17 , 10@xmath1210 arcsec in i - band ; @xcite ) , 28.9 mag / arcsec@xmath32 ( 3@xmath17 , 10@xmath1210 arcsec in r - band ; ) .",
    "as it can be seen , all the surveys have a relatively similar limiting surface brightness limit .",
    "this is as expected due to technical limits of present - day telescopes ( see a discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "this could explain why the number of udgs detected is similar among clusters of similar masses for different groups .",
    "another crucial issue is related to the expected contamination by fore and background .",
    "all the previous authors have applied some particular recipe for cleaning their number counts .",
    "the tightness of the correlation indicates that the abundance of udgs is somehow robust to the different methodologies .    to conclude , our observations support a scenario where present - day udgs are old ( @xmath12 gyr ) , extended , low surface brightness ( @xmath124 mag / arcsec@xmath32 ) dwarf ( m@xmath65@xmath210@xmath7 m@xmath66 ) galaxies .",
    "these galaxies would have been form preferentially in the field where they would be brighter ( i.e. @xmath2224 mag / arcsec@xmath32 and so eluding the current criteria for selecting udgs ) and younger . later on they would be processed in groups ( on scales of around 6 gyr ) and , ultimately , infalled into galaxy clusters by groups accretion .",
