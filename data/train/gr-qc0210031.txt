    "a long term goal in theoretical cosmology is to understand the structure and properties of the space of all cosmological solutions of the einstein field equations ( efes ) , with a view to shedding light on the evolution of the physical universe from the planck time onward . in particular",
    "one wants to study deviations from the familiar friedmann - lematre ( fl ) models , which describe a universe that is exactly homogeneous and isotropic on a suitably large scale . in working towards this goal one makes use of a symmetry - based hierarchy of cosmological models of increasing complexity , starting with the familiar fl models :    1 .",

    "generic cosmologies    the terminology used in this hierarchy has the following meaning .",
    "a sh cosmology is said to be _ tilted _ if the fluid velocity vector is not orthogonal to the group orbits , otherwise the model is said to be _ non - tilted_. a @xmath3 cosmology admits a local two - parameter abelian group of isometries with spacelike orbits , permitting one degree of freedom as regards spatial inhomogeneity , while a @xmath4 cosmology admits one spacelike killing vector field .",
    "an important mathematical link between the various classes in the hierarchy is provided by the idea of representing the physical state of a cosmological model at an instant of time by a point in a _ state space _ , which is finite dimensional for classes and infinite dimensional otherwise .",
    "the efes are formulated as first order evolution equations , and _ the evolution of a cosmological model is represented by an orbit _",
    "( i.e.  a solution curve ) _ of the evolution equations in the state space_. the state space of a particular class in the hierarchy is a subset of the state spaces of the more general classes , which implies that the particular models are represented as special cases of the more general models .",
    "this structure opens the possibility that the evolution of a model in one class may be approximated , over some time interval , by a model in a more special class .",
    "detailed information about the evolution of cosmological models more general than fl models can only be obtained using numerical simulations or perturbation theory . on the other hand , by introducing suitably normalized variables , one can hope to use methods from the theory of dynamical systems to obtain qualitative information about the _",

    "the asymptotic regime @xmath5 corresponds to the approach to the planck time , while the asymptotic regime @xmath8 could describe the later stages of a particular epoch in the evolution of the universe , for example the radiation - dominated epoch in the early universe .",
    "the above comments provide the background for the present paper , which deals with one of the unsolved problems concerning non - tilted sh cosmologies .",
    "there are two generic classes of non - tilted ever - expanding sh cosmologies , namely bianchi type viii and exceptional bianchi type vi@xmath9 , neither of which have been fully analyzed . in this paper",
    "our interest lies in the late - time asymptotic regime of bianchi viii models .",
    "two important results concerning this regime have been proved .",
    "firstly , a theorem of wald ( 1983 ) shows that bianchi viii models _ with a cosmological constant _ are asymptotic at late times to the de  sitter model , subject to rather weak restrictions on the stress - energy tensor .",
    "secondly , ringstrm ( 2001 ) has recently determined rigorously the late - time behaviour of _ vacuum _ bianchi viii models .",
    "we will comment on his results later . on the other hand , little",
    "is known about non - vacuum models with zero cosmological constant , apart from a brief heuristic discussion of models containing dust or radiation by doroshkevich ( 1973 ) and by lukash ( 1974 ) .",
    "we likewise comment on these results later . in the present paper",
    "we give a rigorous analysis of the asymptotic dynamics at late times of bianchi viii cosmologies whose matter content is a perfect fluid with equation of state @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a constant .",
    "this equation of state includes the physically important cases of dust ( @xmath10 ) and radiation ( @xmath11 ) .    to achieve our goal we formulate the efes for the bianchi viii cosmologies as an asymptotically autonomous system of ordinary differential equations , using the hubble - normalized variables first introduced by wainwright and hsu ( 1989 ) and modified by wainwright ( 1999 ) and nilsson ( 2000 ) in their study of the more special bianchi vii@xmath12 models .",
    "we are then able to apply a theorem of strauss and yorke ( 1967 ) concerning the solutions of asymptotically autonomous systems of differential equations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in",
    "we present the evolution equations for sh cosmologies of bianchi type viii using the orthonormal frame formalism and hubble - normalized variables .",
    "the equations are derived in detail in wainwright and ellis ( 1997 ) ( see chapters 5 and 6 ) .",
    "a change of variable then leads to a new form of the evolution equations that is adapted to the oscillatory nature of the bianchi viii models .",
    "in we present the main results , namely theorem  [ theorem_limits ] and corollary  [ corollary_limits ] , which give the limits in the late - time regime of the expansion - normalized variables and of certain physical dimensionless scalars , thereby describing the asymptotic dynamics .",
    "in we strengthen the results of the theorem and corollary by giving the asymptotic form of the expansion - normalized variables and physical scalars at late times .",
    "the notions of asymptotic self - similarity breaking and weyl curvature dominance are discussed in .",
    "finally , in we conclude by giving an overview of the asymptotic dynamics of non - tilted sh perfect fluid cosmologies , noting that the present paper and the accompanying paper hewitt ( 2002 ) fill the gaps that exist in the literature .",
    "there are four appendices .",
    "appendix  a contains the proof of the fact that bianchi viii universes are not asymptotically self - similar at late times .",
    "appendix  b contains the proof of theorem  [ theorem_limits ] while in appendix  c we provide an outline of the derivation of the asymptotic forms at late times .",
    "finally , in appendix  d we give expressions for the components of the weyl curvature tensor in terms of the expansion - normalized variables .",
    "in this section we give the evolution equations for non - tilted sh cosmologies of bianchi type viii .",
    "as described in we ( see pp  1245 ) , we use expansion - normalized variables @xmath13 defined relative to a group - invariant orthonormal frame @xmath14 , with @xmath15 , the fluid 4-velocity , which is normal to the group orbits .    the variables @xmath16 describe the shear of the fluid congruence , and the @xmath17 , @xmath18 describe the intrinsic curvature of the group orbits .",

    "a similar situation occurs in the bianchi vii@xmath12 models analyzed in whu ( see p  2583 ) .",

    "non - tilted perfect fluid spatially homogeneous cosmologies .",
    "the parameter @xmath146 is related to the group parameter @xmath147 through @xmath148 . ]",
    "the principal features of the asymptotic dynamics are as follows .",
    "firstly , as regards the singular asymptotic regime , the three generic classes , namely bianchi type viii , ix and vi@xmath9 ( see  ) have an oscillatory singularity , and the asymptotic behaviour is described by a two - dimensional attractor containing the kasner equilibrium points in the hubble - normalized state space .",
    "we note that the existence of this attractor has only been proved for the bianchi ix models ( see ringstrm ( 2000 ) ) . for non - generic models",
    "the dynamics near the singularity is remarkably simple in the sense that the models are asymptotically self - similar , being approximated by a kasner solution .",
    "secondly , as regards the late - time regime , the dynamics depends crucially on whether or not the hubble - normalized state space is bounded . for the classes vii@xmath12 and viii the state space is unbounded , and the solutions exhibit weyl curvature dominance ( see ) . for the remaining classes ,",
    "the state space is bounded and the models are asymptotically self - similar . in particular , all class b models , including the generic class vi@xmath9 ,",
    "are asymptotically self - similar , although a complete proof of this fact , except in the vacuum subcase , has not been given , due to a lack of success in finding a monotone function for the evolution equations .    referring to the hierarchy in the introduction",
    ", we conclude by giving some suggestions for future research .",
    "firstly , much work remains to be done before the asymptotic dynamics of _ tilted _ sh models are fully understood . while various formulations of the efes have been given ( see we , p  175 ) the only tilted models that have been analyzed in detail is the full class of bianchi ii models ( see hewitt 2001 ) and a special class of bianchi v models ( see hewitt and wainwright  1992 ) .",
    "the difficultly in analyzing the general class of tilted sh models is highlighted by the fact that at this time not all of the self - similar solutions have been found .",
    "secondly , it is a long - standing conjecture that the occurrence of oscillatory singularities in sh models of bianchi types viii and ix implies that oscillatory singularities will occur in generic spatially inhomogeneous models . over the past five years",
    ", considerable numerical and analytical evidence has been provided to support this conjecture ( see weaver 1998 , berger and moncrief 1998 and berger 2001 ) .",
    "likewise , the occurence of weyl curvature dominance in sh models of bianchi types vii@xmath12 and viii leads us to conjecture that this behaviour will also occur in spatially inhomogeneous models , perhaps as generic behaviour . the simplest class in which this behaviour could occur is the class of @xmath3 cosmologies , since the bianchi vii@xmath12 models are contained as a subclass .",
    "it would thus be of interest to investigate the @xmath3 cosmologies from this point of view .",
    "the authors wish to thank conrad hewitt , ulf nilsson and david siegel for helpful comments and discussions .",
    "this research was supported financially by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada through a research grant ( jw ) and undergraduate research awards to jh ( in 2002 ) , to mh ( in 1997 ) and to dt ( in 2000 ) .",
    "in this appendix we prove , concerning the limit of the hubble - normalized variable @xmath45 in the late - time regime . this result is restated as proposition  [ prop_nplus ] below .    for all non - tilted sh cosmologies of bianchi type viii , with equation of state parameter @xmath1 subject to @xmath46 and density parameter",
