    "b0540 - 69 is a young , rotationally powered pulsar in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) that is similar to the crab pulsar in many ways . with a rotation frequency @xmath2 of almost 20 hz ,",
    "it is one of the most rapidly rotating young pulsars known .",
    "its spin - down luminosity ( @xmath3 ) of @xmath4 erg @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the moment of inertia of the neutron star ( ns ) in units of @xmath7 g @xmath8 , is also among the largest for all pulsars .",
    "the spin - down rate of a pulsar is often described in terms of a braking index @xmath9 , in which @xmath10 . the slowdown of b0540 - 69 is relatively stable for a young pulsar , and it is one of only 8 young pulsars for which a braking index has been reliably measured ( lyne  2015 ) .",
    "it has a characteristic spin - down age ( @xmath11 ) of @xmath12 years .",
    "pulsars are remarkably stable rotators , and the deviations from clocklike precision can provide information about the structure and processes at work in the neutron star and its magnetosphere .",
    "sudden changes in @xmath2 and @xmath0 ( `` glitches '' ) are occasionally seen in pulsars , especially those with ages between @xmath13 and @xmath14 years ( yu  2013 ) .",
    "glitches are thought to occur in rotationally powered pulsars when angular momentum is transferred from a more rapidly rotating component of the ns to the outer crust ( e.g. , anderson & itoh 1975 ; franco  2000 ) .",
    "a different kind of rapid change is seen in some pulsars that affects the spin - down rate . in their examination of long - term monitoring of 366 pulsars",
    ", lyne  ( 2010 ) found that many pulsars rapidly switch between two different spin - down rates .",
    "the time scales for the transitions are quasi - periodic , with typical time scales of years .",
    "`` intermittent pulsars '' are extreme examples of such pulsars .",
    "they transition from a radio - on state to radio - off state with a simultaneous change in the spin - down rate .",
    "the best studied example is psr b1931 + 24 ( kramer  2006 ; young  2013 ) for which multiple transitions on a timescale of weeks from a radio bright state with @xmath15 hz s@xmath16 and a radio quiet state with @xmath17 hz s@xmath16 have been observed .",
    "similar behavior on longer time scales has been reported for psr j1832 + 0029 ( lorimer  2012 ) and psr j1841 - 0500 ( camilo  2012 ) .",
    "all three pulsars show rapid transitions between two states with stable spin - down rates , large differences in the spin - down rates , large changes in the radio flux , and no simultaneous change in @xmath2 . unlike most explanations for glitches , models for these state changes have emphasized changes in the pulsar s magnetosphere ( e.g. , li  2012 ) .",
    "none of the intermittent pulsars have been detected in the optical , x - ray , or gamma - ray bands , but somewhat similar behavior has been seen for the gamma - ray pulsar psr j2021 + 4026 ( allafort  2013 ) . a 4% increase in @xmath0 was seen with a simultaneous decrease of 18% in the flux above 100 mev with a time scale for the transition of less than a week . since there is no radio counterpart , any change in radio flux is not known .",
    "b0540 - 69 has been extensively studied since its discovery with the  ( seward  1984 ) . a small glitch for b0540 - 69",
    "was reported by zhang  ( 2001 ) with a relative change in @xmath2 of @xmath18 and @xmath0 of @xmath19 .",
    "the reality of this glitch was disputed by cusumano  ( 2003 ) and later supported by livingstone  ( 2005 ) .",
    "ferdman  ( 2015 ) examined 15.8 years of data from   and report a second glitch with a relative change in @xmath2 of @xmath20 and @xmath0 of @xmath21 .",
    "both these changes in @xmath0 are orders of magnitude smaller than we report in this paper .",
    "no other glitches have been reported in the extensive monitoring of the pulsar .",
    "optical pulsations are also seen ( mignani  2010 and references therein ) .",
    "manchester  ( 1993 ) discovered radio pulsations with an above average luminosity at 640 mhz of 1200 mjy kpc@xmath22 .",
    "in this paper we present and discuss new timing analysis of b0540 - 69 as observed with  and   details of the observations and the results of the temporal analysis are reported in section 2 , and interpretations are given in section 3 .",
    "finally , section 4 is a summary .",
    "b0540 - 69 was observed with the proportional counter array ( pca ) on board the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( ) ( bradt  1993 ) during a 12.5-year campaign to monitor the nearby psr  0537 .",
    "the final observation was on dec .",
    "31 , 2011 .",
    "we concentrate on observations covering the final 140 days of the campaign .",
    "results from  observations have been reported by zhang  ( 2001 ) , livingstone  ( 2005 ) and ferdman  ( 2015 ) .",
    "the pca is composed of five co - aligned xenon detectors ( proportional counter units ( pcus ) ) with a total area of @xmath23 @xmath24 .",
    "individual pcus were routinely turned off and on to reduce the number of high - voltage breakdowns .",
    "additional observations were made with the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) instrument ( burrows  2005 ) on the _ swift gamma - ray burst explorer _",
    "( gehrels  2004 ) starting in feb . , 2015 .",
    "table [ obs_log ] is a log of the observations .",
    "data reduction for both missions followed very similar procedures .",
    "x - ray events were screened to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio , and then photon arrival times were corrected to the solar system barycenter with the ftool faxbary for  and barycorr for    using the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "position of @xmath25 , @xmath26 ( j2000.0 ) ( mignani  2010 ) .",
    "the mid - point of each observation was chosen as the epoch , and then the best period was determined by comparing multiple folded light curves using efsearch . since the folded light curve is approximately a sine wave ( cusumano  2003 ) , the phase at the epoch was determined by fitting a sine wave to the folded light curve produced with efold and using the phase of the peak of the sine wave .",
    "the resulting frequencies and phases were fit to the usual truncated taylor series expansion of the phase and its time derivatives @xmath2 , @xmath0 , and @xmath27 .",
    "uncertainties quoted in this paper are given at the 90% confidence level unless otherwise noted .",
    "for multi - parameter fits , the other parameters are allowed to vary when calculating the limits .",
    "the pca is sensitive to x - rays in the 2 to 60 kev band with moderate ( @xmath28 ) resolution .",
    "each event is time - tagged on the spacecraft with an accuracy better than @xmath29 s ( rots  1998 ) . to improve the signal - to - noise ratio , only events in the first xenon layer in the energy range of @xmath30 kev",
    "were included .",
    "figure  [ joint_residuals ] shows the frequency residuals for the last 14  observations relative to the best - fit ephemeris model for the first 12 of the observations .",
    "the value of @xmath27 is set to @xmath31 , the best - fit value for observations between oct .",
    "2010 and dec .",
    "the model , whose parameters are given in table  [ ephemeris ] , provides a very good fit to the first 12 observations with rms phase residuals of @xmath321% , but the final two observations deviate dramatically .",
    "a linear fit to the frequencies for the final two observations indicates that @xmath0 has changed by @xmath33 hz s@xmath16 with a statistical uncertainty of @xmath34 hz s@xmath16 at some time between the observations on dec .",
    "3 and dec . 17 .",
    "this is an increase of @xmath35 in the rate at which the pulsar s spin is slowing .",
    "this value is consistent with , but less accurate than , the value determined in section 2.2 using both   and  data .",
    "we note that our value for @xmath27 is @xmath36 lower than the values reported by ferdman  ( 2015 ) for longer intervals of  data .",
    "reprocessing the  data using the ferdman  values for @xmath27 demonstrates that revising @xmath27 would have a negligible effect on our results and would not change our conclusions .",
    "if the sudden change in @xmath0 were due to a glitch , then a simultaneous change in @xmath2 would be expected .",
    "surveys of glitches in other pulsars find that the amplitude of a glitch in @xmath2 correlates with the amplitude of the glitch in @xmath0 for pulsars in general ( espinoza  2011 ) and for the crab pulsar in particular ( lyne  2015 ) .",
    "the correlation for pulsars in general would indicate an accompanying glitch in b0540 - 69 larger than @xmath37 hz , and the correlation for the crab would indicate an accompanying glitch of @xmath38 hz .",
    "there is no indication of an accompanying change in @xmath2 , and we place limits on its possible size by assuming an instantaneous glitch with no recovery and extrapolating the fit to the post - glitch frequencies back toward the final pre - glitch observation . with these assumptions the largest glitch would occur immediately after the final pre - glitch observation with a size of @xmath39 hz .",
    "later glitches would be smaller until at 200 ks after final pre - glitch observation there would be no glitch in @xmath2 .    large glitches in @xmath0",
    "typically decay away on time scales from about a day to weeks .",
    "since the new value for @xmath0 is consistent with that later seen with  ( section [ xrt ] ) , there is also no indication of such a recovery .",
    "we conclude that the sudden change in @xmath0 is almost certainly a state transition rather than a glitch .",
    "we will refer to the state before the transition as the `` low spin - down '' state and the state after the transition as the `` high spin - down '' state .",
    "there is also no indication of a change in the pulsed x - ray emission from b0540 - 69 .",
    "figure  [ pulsed_rate ] shows the average pulsed count rate ( @xmath40 , where a is the relative sine wave amplitude , c is the total number of counts detected , @xmath41 is the exposure time , and @xmath42 is the average number of pcus that were on during the observation ) . the average pulsed count rate for the two observations after the transition ( @xmath43 ) is consistent with the average for the first 12 observations ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "further the folded light curves for these two observations show no significant change .    to confirm the continued nominal performance of the pca including the final two observations , we processed the same observations for psr  0537  following the procedures given in marshall  ( 2004 ) .",
    "after the glitch near mjd 55815 , the final 12 observations are very well fit using the standard form for the ephemeris with an rms phase residual of @xmath45 .",
    "we conclude that the unexpected values of @xmath2 for b0540 - 69 are not due to any instrumental effect .",
    "the x - ray telescope started observations of b0540 - 69 on feb .",
    "17 , 2015 , as part of a target of opportunity campaign .",
    "the xrt is a focusing x - ray telescope with a ccd detector with an effective bandpass of 0.3 - 10 kev .",
    "all observations were made using the window timing ( wt ) mode in which the central 200 ccd columns are continously read out , providing a time resolution of 1.7 ms .",
    "the xrt data were reduced with the standard software ( xrtpipeline v0.13.1 ) applying the default filtering and screening criteria ( heasoft 6.16 ) , using the 20140709 update to the xrt caldb files and the 20150428 update to the clock correction file .",
    "the phase and frequency were measured for each continuous viewing interval ( a `` snapshot '' ) .",
    "each of the   entries in table [ obs_log ] except the first consists of two snapshots separated by about 96 minutes ( the duration of a ",
    "the first entry has a single snapshot .",
    "we obtained the best ephemeris by determining a model for the closely spaced observations and then refining the model as more widely separated observations were added .",
    "all the models assumed a value of @xmath31 for @xmath27 based on measurements with  before the state transition in 2011 .",
    "this parameter makes a very small contribution to the model because the duration of the current ",
    "campaign is only 65 days .",
    "the best - fit model was confirmed using a large grid search of possible combinations of @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "the parameters of the best - fit model and the 90% confidence uncertainties are given in table [ ephemeris ] .",
    "the model provides a good fit to the data with rms phase residuals of @xmath323% .",
    "figure [ joint_residuals ] , which shows the frequency residuals relative to the  ephemeris before the transition , displays the overall history of @xmath2 .",
    "we used two methods to determine @xmath0 after the state transition .",
    "the first method uses the best - fit model for the xrt data ( table [ ephemeris ] ) with a value of @xmath46 at the xrt epoch . after adjusting by @xmath47 to account for the effect of @xmath27 , this is a change in @xmath0 from the value before the transition ( table [ ephemeris ] ) of @xmath48 .",
    "the second method compares the average value of @xmath2 in the final two  observations ( @xmath49 hz @xmath50 hz at mjd 55919.71 ) with the best - fit value for the xrt data of @xmath51 hz @xmath52 hz . the resulting @xmath0 is @xmath53 s@xmath54 at mjd 56498.62 . after adjusting by @xmath55 to account for the effect of @xmath27 ,",
    "the result is @xmath56 s@xmath54 at the xrt epoch , which is larger than result from the first method by @xmath57 s@xmath54 .",
    "this discrepancy is shown in figure  [ joint_residuals ] in which the extrapolation of the xrt ephemeris back to the final two  observations predicts a value for @xmath2 that is @xmath58 larger than that observed .",
    "the uncertainty of the extrapolated values due to the uncertainty in the model s @xmath0 is only @xmath59 hz .",
    "the discrepancy suggests that the evolution of the high spin - down state is more complicated than our simple model .",
    "the second method indicates a change in @xmath0 from the value before the transition of @xmath60 .",
    "since the value of @xmath27 after the state transition is uncertain and the statistical uncertainties are small , we use the value of the adjustments due to @xmath27 to estimate the uncertainty .",
    "the relative change in @xmath0 is then @xmath61 and @xmath62 for the first and second methods respectively .",
    "we adopt @xmath63 , the average of the two methods with an uncertainty that encompasses the individual error bars , as our best estimate of the relative change in @xmath0 .",
    "the folded light curve is similar to that reported from other x - ray observations ( e.g. , cusumano  2003 ) . although the actual light curve is more complicated , a model of a constant plus a gaussian provides a good description of the xrt data .",
    "the best - fit standard deviation for the gaussian is @xmath64 , which is consistent with a fit to the folded light curve for the  data before the state transition .",
    "b0540 - 69 has been extensively monitored by numerous observatories in the more than 30 years since its discovery including _ ginga _ observations spanning 4.4 years ( deeter  1999 ) and the 12.5 years of observations with .",
    "more than 10 measurements of the braking index for the pulsar , which require long spans of data , have been reported ( cusumano  2003 , who list previous measurements ; ferdman  2015 ) .",
    "values for the braking index range from 1.81 ( zhang  2001 ) to 2.74 ( gelman & hasinger 1990 ) .",
    "none of these studies found a sudden change in @xmath0 comparable to the one reported here .",
    "the glitches in @xmath0 reported by zhang  ( 2001 ) and ferdman  ( 2015 ) are @xmath322000 times smaller , and knowledge of the pulsar s phase is maintained throughout the 12.5 years of  monitoring until the final two observations .",
    "when discovered with the  ( seward  1984 ) , b0540 - 69 had a @xmath0 of @xmath65 hz s@xmath16 , which indicates that the pulsar was in the low spin - down state in 1979 and 1980 .",
    "the lack of published values of @xmath0 indicative of the high spin - down state suggests that b0540 - 69 remained in the low spin - down state the vast majority of the time , if not all the time , until the transition in late 2011 .",
    "the sudden change in the spin - down rate is most likely associated with a change in the magnetosphere of the ns .",
    "one possibility is a global change in the conductivity of the magnetosphere .",
    "li  ( 2012 ) developed solutions for pulsar magnetospheres with finite resistivity that mitigate some of the limitations of the vacuum and force - free models .",
    "the dependence of the spin - down luminosity was calculated for a wide range of the conductivity parameter @xmath66 ( expressed in terms of the pulsar angular rotation rate @xmath67 ) and inclination angle @xmath68 using a three - dimensional numerical code . for broad ranges of @xmath68 ( 0@xmath69 to 90@xmath70 and the conductivity ( @xmath71 from 0.04 to 4.0 ) , a 36% increase in the luminosity ( and by extension in @xmath72 ) can be achieved with an increase in @xmath66 of less than a factor of 6 .",
    "there are maximum values of @xmath71 , ranging from 40 at @xmath73 to 1.3 at @xmath74 above which it is no longer possible to explain an increase in the luminosity with an increase in @xmath66 . since for large values of @xmath75 , the component of the electric field parallel to the magnetic field @xmath76 ( kalapotharakos  2014 ) , an increase in @xmath66 may reduce the gamma - ray flux from the pulsar .",
    "the long - term light curve of b0540 - 69 in the energy range of 200 mev to 100 gev ( fermi - lat collaboration 2015 ) shows no indication of change in the gamma - ray flux with an upper limit of 30% .",
    "detailed modelling , such as that done by brambilla  ( 2015 ) for other fermi pulsars , is needed to understand the implication of this constraint on parameters for b0540 - 69 , but this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "another possible explanation for the spin - down transition is a change in torque due to a change in the plasma outflow from the polar caps .",
    "kramer  ( 2006 ) suggested this to explain the state transitions in the intermittent pulsar psr b1931 + 24 .",
    "unlike psr b1931 + 24 , b0540 - 69 appears to be radio bright in its low spin - down state , but its radio flux may significantly increase or its pulse shape may change in the high spin - down state . following young",
    "we estimate the change in the charge density @xmath77 as @xmath78 c m@xmath79 , assuming a pulsar radius of 10 km and i@xmath80 of @xmath81 .",
    "this estimate of 0.78 c m@xmath79 is close to the goldreich - julian charge density for b0540 - 69 of 1.09 c m@xmath79 .",
    "an increase in @xmath77 predicts an increase in the radio flux , which can be tested with radio observations of the high spin - down state .",
    "it also predicts a reduction in the braking index as the relative importance of magnetic dipole radiation decreases .    a change in the amount of open poloidal magnetic flux would also change the spin - down luminosity , which is expected to be proportional to @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the radius beyond which the magnetic field lines become open ( contopoulos 2007 ) .",
    "an 36% increase in the spin - down luminosity with no change in @xmath2 would require a 15% decrease in @xmath83 .",
    "the spin - down rate of b0540 - 69 increased suddenly by 36% ( a change in @xmath0 of @xmath84 hz s@xmath16 ) between dec .",
    "3 and dec . 17 , 2011 .",
    "observations with   in 2015 show that this change in spin - down rate has persisted for more than 3 years .",
    "such a large persistent change in the spin - down rate has never been reported for b0540 - 69 .",
    "there is no indication of a simultaneous change in the pulse shape in x - rays , the pulsed x - ray luminosity , or the total gamma - ray luminosity .",
    "we interpret this change as a transition between two stable states of the pulsar , similar to state transitions in other pulsars .",
    "b0540 - 69 extends the class of state changing pulsars to include a very young and luminous example .",
    "the transitions in b0540 - 69 appear to be rare with the low spin - down state probably lasting more than 30 years .",
    "future work can test predicted changes in the radio flux and the braking index in the high spin - down state .",

    "<S> the relative increase in the spin - down rate @xmath0 of @xmath1 is unprecedented for b0540 - 69 . </S>",
    "<S> no accompanying change in the spin rate is seen , and no change is seen in the pulsed x - ray emission from b0540 - 69 following the change in the spin - down rate . </S>",
    "<S> such large relative changes in the spin - down rate are seen in the recently discovered class of `` intermittent pulsars '' , and we compare the properties of b0540 - 69 to such pulsars . </S>",
    "<S> we consider possible changes in the magnetosphere of the pulsar that could cause such a large change in the spin - down rate . </S>"
