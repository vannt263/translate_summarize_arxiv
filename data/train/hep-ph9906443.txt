    "the qcd phase diagram version circa 1999 @xcite , shown in fig [ fig_phases_th](a ) , looks rather different from what was shown at previous quark matter conferences .",
    "most significant progress is seen in the large - density low - t region , where two new color super - conducting phases have appeared .",
    "unfortunately heavy ion collisions do not cross this part of the phase diagrams : it belongs to neutron star physics .",
    "the subject is covered in talks @xcite , so i only make few comments here . the 2-flavor - like color superconductor csc2 phase was known before @xcite , but realization that it should be induced by instantons @xcite has increased the gaps ( and @xmath0 ) from a few mev scale to @xmath1100 mev ( 50 mev ) .",
    "it is hardly surprising , since the @xmath2 interaction in @xmath3 channel is responsible for chiral symmetry breaking , with the gap ( a constituent quark mass ) 350 - 400 mev .",
    "the symmetries of the csc2 phase are similar to the electroweak part of the standard model , with scalar isoscalar @xmath4 diquark as higgs .",
    "the colored condensate breaks the color group , making 5 out of 8 gluons massive .",
    "the 3-flavor - like phase , csc3 , is brand new : it was proposed in @xcite based on one gluon exchange interaction , but in fact it is favored by instantons as well @xcite .",
    "its unusual features include _ color - flavor locking _ and _ coexistence _ of both types of condensates , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "it combines features of the higgs phase ( 8 massive gluons ) and of the usual hadronic phase ( 8 massless `` pions '' ) .",
    "surprisingly , at very large densities cooper pairs are bound magnetically @xcite , leading to growing gaps at extremely large @xmath7 .",
    "another important new element is the ( remnant of ) the qcd tricritical point @xcite .",
    "although we do not know where it is ] , we hope we know how to find it , see @xcite .",

    "now , with accurate statistical description of the particle composition , small and gaussian event - by - event ( ebe ) fluctuations , and detailed data on collective flow , people are using macroscopic language more than before , and so it is entirely appropriate to start with a discussion of _ where we are on the phase diagram_.    looking at the fireball by a detector is like looking at the sun : one can only see the photo - sphere , with @xmath8 , not the hotter interior . because we can see many hadronic species",
    ", we can also trace down conditions at which the composition is formed .",
    "the result can be summarized as two separate freeze - out points , @xmath9 or kinetic one , and @xmath10 : a recent sample of those coming from sps , ags and sis data is shown in fig.[fig_phases_th](b ) .",
    "the chemical point are about the same for all a , but the thermal ones are `` cooler '' for larger a. for a discussion of freeze - out systematics see @xcite . only at sps",
    "we find that the two freeze - outs are well separated , and so we indeed found a new phase of matter at sps , never seen before : namely a _ chemically frozen thermally equilibrated `` resonance '' gas_.    the zigzag shaped paths on the phase diagram are _ adiabatic curves _ for a particular eos @xcite(b ) which i have discussed at qm97 @xcite(c ) : one can see that measured freeze - out points at sps and ags happen to be close to the predicted paths .",
    "do chemical and thermal points indeed follow the same adiabates of `` resonance gas '' ?",
    "the points in fig.[fig_phases_th](b ) are not accurate enough to say that , but it can be studied in models . in @xcite the urqmd cascade was studied , and although the non - equilibrium effects in some observables can be large , the exact and equilibrium expressions for entropy differ by only about 6% .",
    "also the kinetic models agree that most of the entropy is produced early , and then it is only slightly affected by re - scattering . in summary",
    ": the adiabatic paths seem to be the paths to follow !",
    "the main news from the last few years is that at ags / sps energy domain the heavy ion collisions really produce a _ little bang rather than a fizzle _ , with strong explosive transverse flow converting a significant part of thermal energy into that of collective motion .    looking two decades ago at the pp isr data i have found @xcite no trace of transverse radial flow : the @xmath11 slopes for various secondaries were identical . only in mid-90s a significant difference in slopes",
    "was observed , first for light- and then heavy - ion collisions .",
    "at all previous qm conferences the origin of these slopes was debated .",
    "are differences in aa and pp due to `` initial state '' parton re - scattering or the final state re - scattering of hadrons ?",
    "now the debate is mostly over since the amount of evidences which proves the latter is overwhelming .",
    "let me mention two of them .",
    "( i ) initial state scattering may broaden the nucleon @xmath11 spectra , but it then predicts _ the same _ slope for deuterons , contrary to observations . only a correlation between the two nucleons can explain data , and the calculated flow reproduces it well@xcite .",
    "( ii ) slopes for @xmath12 depend linearly on particle mass ( common flow velocity @xmath13 ) , except for strange baryons .",
    "the largest deviation is found for @xmath14 : this is nicely explained @xcite by its early freeze - out due to smaller cross sections not have a small slope as well ?",
    "see discussion below . ] .    how large is the transverse flow velocity @xmath13 ?",
    "the fits to `` hydro - motivated '' formulae have produced widely varying values , which also were strongly a- and rapidity dependent .",
    "the explanation was worked out in the hydro - kinetic framework @xcite , which i also described at qm97 .",
    "the @xmath15 of this work , `` the larger the system , the further it cools '' , explains both strong a and y dependence of flow .",
    "very large @xmath16 and very low @xmath17 in pbpb were predicted .",
    "later analysis based heavily on na44,na49 * hbt radii * @xmath18 spectra have confirmed such selection @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath13 is important because it _ tells us about the eos of hadronic matter_. the observed values are mostly generated by `` resonance gas '' , which at sps has simple eos @xcite @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath13 is large because `` resonance gas '' at @xmath21 has no hagedorn `` softening '' .",
    "so , the hagedorn softening would have happened in qcd at @xmath22 , if not for the light - quark dominated transition at lower t. ] .",
    "the mixed phase is however softer , with the minimum of @xmath23 ( the _ the softest point _ ) corresponding to all matter converted to qgp .",
    "it was predicted @xcite(a ) that the collisions which start from this condition should last longer .",
    "we are waiting for the next sps run , at 40 gev , to see if this prediction is indeed confirmed .      in high energy collisions",
    "the shape of the `` initial almond '' for non - central collisions leads to enhanced `` in - plane '' flow , in the direction of the impact parameter @xcite .",
    "it is very important because ( as pointed out in @xcite(a ) ) it is developed @xmath24 than the radial one , and thus it may shed light on whether we do or do not have qgp at such time .",
    "now it is measured by the asymmetry of the particle @xmath25 , or @xmath26 harmonics defined as @xmath27 rather than asymmetry of the momentum distribution .",
    "furthermore , @xmath26 can be additionally normalized to the spatial asymmetry of the initial state ( the `` almond '' ) at the same @xmath28 , in order to cancel out this kinematic factor and to see the response to asymmetry .",

    "first news is indication for * softening of eos * at @xmath31 observed by eos detector at ags , exactly where the initial conditions are expected to hit for the first time the critical line ( see @xcite ) . at",
    "the same energy @xmath32 ratio and other strangeness enhancement signals change rapidly .",
    "both indicate that the mixed phase is actually reached _ already at such low energies_.    the dash - dotted curve for energies above the sps is from hydro calculations @xcite . in agreement with @xcite ,",
    "large and near constant ellipticity in this region is found , driven by _ the qgp push _ at early times .",
    "strong decrease of this effect is expected in the sps domain , as the ",
    "qgp push \" disappears .",
    "the dashed curve is my speculation of what the excitation function of @xmath29 may be in the sps domain .",
    "the existence of a @xmath33 is not obvious , but an * inflection point * seems inevitable determine the expansion time : so in this case the argument should be valid . ] .",
    "let us now turn to sps data , which depict @xmath34 dependence of @xmath29 .",
    "this issue is more complicated , because by increasing @xmath28 we make the `` almond '' more elliptic , but also much smaller and thinner : eventually finite size corrections reduce the pressure build - up(a ) is below the hydro prediction . ] .",
    "one needs cascade codes to study this effect : see @xcite .",
    "last year rqmd has been radically changed , including the possibility to vary the eos and to include the  qgp push \" . new version @xcite(b ) predicts a relative growth of ( properly normalized to spatial asymmetry ) @xmath29 at small @xmath28 , to values close to those predicted by hydro .",
    "preliminary na49 data presented at this meeting @xcite indeed observe such enhancement at small @xmath28 .    much more work is clearly needed to understand this complex interplay of eos and finite size effects .",
    "u collisions discussed below in principle provide the means to decouple finite size and deformation issues .",
    "the next run ( 40 agev ) data are also of great importance here : no `` qgp push '' is expected there .",
    "if a clear difference in @xmath35 between 40 and 158 gev is observed , it would really be the first sign of _ the qgp push _ at sps .    whether it is seen at sps or not , it certainly is expected to lead to quite dramatic phenomena at rhic .",
    "a very non - trivial and highly eos - sensitive expansion pattern is predicted in @xcite : the so called `` nutcracker '' scenario ( for non - central collisions ) includes formation of two `` shells '' , which are physically separated from each other by freeze - out , with only a small `` nut '' at the center .",
    "this behavior predicts higher moments @xmath36 of specific kind growing with energy , and spectacular hbt radii .",
    "we are looking forward to first rhic data to see if this is true .",
    "search for `` unusual '' events ( e.g. disoriented chiral condensate ) had attracted significant attention in the past , but they were not found .",
    "na49 has shown that fluctuations in such observables as @xmath37 are rather small and gaussian , without unusual tails .",
    "their widths can be measured rather accurately .",
    "what can we learn from them ?",
    "it is tempting to apply thermodynamical approach based on entropy here annihilation were calculated from ideal gas entropy . ] .",
    "furthermore , as the temperature fluctuation is related to specific heat @xmath38 , it was proposed in @xcite to use it to measure @xmath39 of a hadronic matter at freeze - out .",
    "for example , at the critical point mentioned above , @xmath39 diverges and @xmath40 must vanish .",
    "can this dramatic prediction be somehow observed ?",
    "unfortunately , as explained in @xcite , this argument is too naive .",
    "pions can indeed be used as a  thermometer \" , in contact with a fluctuating medium ( the sigmas ) , but fluctuations of its t measures mostly the _ thermometer s own _ @xmath39 . the critical fluctuations can be seen , but only as a correction at the 10% level or so .",
    "the fluctuations for intensive and extensive observables are generally of different nature .",
    "an example of the former case is @xmath37 : the deviation of the measured width from pure statistics ( mixed events ) is in this case surprisingly small .",
    "fluctuations of particle composition @xcite are also intensive , and they are sensitive to resonances . new point : if one would be able to get any hold on multiple production of multi - strange objects , one can tell if such exotic objects as `` color ropes '' do or do not exist .",
    "an example of an extensive variable is total multiplicity : even restricted to central 5% na49 finds a gaussian width @xmath41 that for random ( poisson ) emission .",
    "as shown in @xcite , only about half of the effect comes from resonances at freeze - out .",
    "the rest must come from fluctuations in initial conditions : see discussion in @xcite .",
    "i think the most interesting part of the development is attention to mixture of the two , such as @xmath42 .",
    "as explained in @xcite , those do not appear in simple statistics , and so carry non - trivial information .",
    "although we have now reached some understanding of the * hadronic stage * of the evolution , from chemical to kinetic freeze - out , we know very little about _ what happens before it_. ignoring details , let me emphasize two major points of view present on the market : ( i ) * the qgp scenario * ( hopefully our future standard model ) , based on a picture of quick matter equilibration ; and ( ii ) * string scenario * , represented by most traditional lund - type event generators like venus and rqmd , or reggion - based approaches like dpm .",
    "a positive feature of the former approach is obviously its conceptual simplicity , while the latter has direct connection to pp and pa phenomenology .",
    "@xmath43 can explain why the initial eos is soft enough not to contribute much to the radial flow .",
    "* particle composition * would be a stronghold of thermodynamics , if not for the fact that in pp and @xmath44 collisions it is also possible to use successfully statistical models .",
    "the difference is however seen in the * strangeness * production , much suppressed in pp and @xmath44 but not in aa .",
    "the qgp scenario explains it naturally , while the string one needs `` color ropes '' ( or other exotic devices ) to explain the strangeness .",
    "significant experimental efforts have been made to locate the transition between two extremes , the pp - type and heavy - ion - type regimes of strangeness production .",
    "excellent data from wa97,na49 for @xmath45 and their anti - particles found that strangeness has _",
    "little dependence on centrality_. lighter ion data obtained before also confirm the impression that strangeness production is _ basically constant _ throughout the sps domain , with the transition being somewhere in the ags domain . to me",
    "it indicates that strangeness `` un - suppression '' is clearly related with the approach of the hadronic phase boundary , production of the mixed phase with at least @xmath46 qgp .",
    "we will separately discuss @xmath47 melting and @xmath48 suppression below : but let me now emphasize their contrasting a dependence .",
    "ceres data on dilepton enhancement below @xmath47 show comparable effect in sau and pbau , while the na50 @xmath48 suppression is drastically different .",
    "why is it so ?",
    "it is a must to see if the energy dependence of two effects is different as well .    by adding @xmath49 in between , and decomposing @xmath48 into @xmath50 and proper @xmath48 parts",
    ", one would get a whole sequence of `` melting '' phenomena , happening as matter becomes hotter / denser .",
    "we will see at rhic how members of the @xmath51 family do the same later on . which of them is the qgp signal then ?",
    "well , this depends on details which we still have to work out .      as `` penetrating probes '' @xcite",
    ", dileptons suppose to tell us the story of `` melting '' of all vector mesons ( @xmath52 ) , replaced by radiation from thermal quarks .",
    "all sps dilepton experiments ( helios-3,ceres , na50 ) see significant dilepton enhancement ( compared to `` trivial sources '' ) , being stronger at small @xmath53 , indicating matter effects .",
    "the first important issue is the origin of the enhancement observed by na50 at @xmath54 .",
    "it was suggested that it is due to _ enhanced charm production _ , but another ( and , in my mind , much more probable ) explanation is the _ thermal qgp emission _ @xcite .",
    "the qgp - like rate reproduces helios3 data @xcite , and preliminary estimates @xcite show it works for na50 data as well .",
    "the origin of a qualitative change of the shape of the vector spectral density @xmath55 for @xmath56 observed by ceres was discussed here in detail @xcite , let me therefore address only one central question : to what extent does the observed `` @xmath47 melting '' indicate an approach to chiral symmetry restoration ?    in - matter",
    "@xmath47 width is significantly increased , mostly by re - scattering on nucleons .",
    "the non - trivial fact is : even for small masses @xmath57 the rate ( obtained in a complicated hadronic calculation @xcite ) happen to be rather close to the `` partonic '' or qgp rate , corresponding to free @xmath58 annihilation in the heat bath .",
    "it tells us that the interaction between @xmath59 and @xmath60 in the vector channel is becoming weak .",
    "@xmath61 axial spectral density is modified similarly as well , the finite - t weinberg - like sum rules @xcite demand that the chirally - odd quantities in its r.h.s .",
    "become small , which means chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "@xmath61 the axial spectral density remains different , chiral symmetry is still broken . although we can not access it directly , one may still look for dalitz - type decays of @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "let me start with a brief comment on the @xmath49 suppression .",
    "the na50 data show that the @xmath63 ratio stop falling and is stabilized ata small value , about 4% .",
    "an explanation suggested in @xcite is : all @xmath49 are killed first , but then are re - created from @xmath48 .",
    "the central na50 finding is of course a statement that @xmath48 suppression for central ( b@xmath64 8 fm ) pbpb collisions is different from extrapolations based on pa and sa collisions",
    ". several mechanisms of this suppression were proposed : ( i ) gluonic photo - effect @xcite ; ( ii ) these states simply do not exist in qgp due to debye screening @xcite ; ( iii ) hadronic co - movers kill them @xcite ; ( iv ) non - monotonous variation of the qgp lifetime , due to the `` softest point '' @xcite .",
    "new data reported at this meeting have clarified the situation for the most central collisions : using now a very thin target , it was found that the 1996 data suffered from multiple interactions .",
    "in fact there is a significantly stronger suppression at small @xmath28 , making the two component picture with separate @xmath50 and @xmath65 thresholds more probable .",
    "it is desirable to make another step , increasing the density and/or the famous variable l : only deformed u provides an opportunity here .",
    "what else can be done to discriminate experimentally these ideas ?",
    "in particularly , how can we tell whether suppression happened quickly or took a longer time ?",
    "the old idea is to study suppression dependence on @xmath53 . unfortunately changing @xmath53 we also change the kinematics :",
    "e.g. destruction by gluons or hadrons goes better if @xmath53 grows .",
    "maybe a better idea @xcite is to use the azimuthal dependence of the suppression .",
    "instantaneous suppression should show @xmath66 asymmetry , but if it takes a few fm / c the anisotropy should show up .",
    "the problem is the initial `` almond '' at @xmath67 8 fm is not very anisotropic , and for larger @xmath28 there is no anomalous suppression .",
    "( here too the deformed u can help . )",
    "@xmath68 is a little brother of @xmath48 , but its production in aa is @xmath69 rather than suppressed , as compared to nn .",
    "whatever effects are killing @xmath48 s , @xmath68 is re - created because strangeness is close to equilibrium at chemical freeze - out .",
    "the first puzzle is the _ apparent absence of @xmath68 in - matter modification . _ as argued @xcite , even modest modification of kaons should strongly ( by factor 2 or so ) increase the width of @xmath68 decay inside the fireball .",
    "non - negligible fraction of @xmath68 , up to a half , should decay in - matter , while experimentally ( see e.g. excellent na49 data presented here by c.hohne ) @xmath66 @xmath68 modification is seen at all !    the second puzzle ( already mentioned in the flow section ) is that the @xmath11 slopes of @xmath68 spectra measured by na49 in kk channel are large , close to those of the @xmath70 ( particles of similar mass ) .",
    "it suggests that somehow @xmath68 participates fully in the radial flow .",
    "how is it possible , with its small re - scattering cross section ? new na50 data on @xmath68 reported at this conference@xcite",
    "have a different slope than na49 , only about 220 mev . if extrapolated from larger @xmath53 ( where na50 data are ) to small ones , they go well above the na49 ones .",
    "all puzzles may be explained if absorption destroy k from most in - matter decays in a collective potential .",
    "] , more so at low @xmath53 .",
    "obviously , there should be no missing @xmath68 in dilepton channel , and so such experiments should see the @xmath68 missing from kk channel at low @xmath53 .",
    "( phenix at rhic will have good resolution in both channels , so it should eventually clarify the issue . )    in summary : as a first ( indirect ) sign of missing ( modified ? )",
    "@xmath68 we have evidences for the unusual change of its @xmath11 slope .",
    "if able to cover smaller @xmath53 , na50 should see @xmath68 spectra which are _ different _ from na49 , including those which decay inside the fireball .",
    "the first obvious connection between the  little bangs \" in aa collisions and the  big bang \" is that both are violent explosions .",
    "expansion of the created hadronic fireball approximately follows the hubble law , @xmath71 , although anisotropic one .",
    "the @xmath72 velocities , the hubble constant and @xmath13 , have been a matter of debates few years ago , but now are believed to be fixed ( at say 10% level ) .",
    "the next important issue in both cases is the _ acceleration history _ , needed to shed some light on the fundamental eos .",
    "cosmologists use distant supernovae to access flow long ago : we use @xmath14 to learn what was the flow at `` mid - time '' ( 5 - 10 fm / c ) .    the last point : angular anisotropy of flow and its fluctuations .",
    "amazingly accurate measurements of the microwave background have found a dipole anisotropy ( due to our motion relative to `` ether '' ) and tiny ( @xmath73 ) fluctuations with angular momentum @xmath74 due to frozen plasma oscillations , from the freeze - out stage in which the qed plasma was neutralized into ordinary atomic matter . in the little bang",
    "we have @xmath75 dipole and elliptic flows of a few percent . @xmath76",
    "higher harmonics are not analyzed yet : there must be some trace of `` frozen qgp oscillations '' as well .",
    "true , cosmologists have much more photons , but they are restricted to _ only one event _ , while we have millions of them !      an old idea is to select head - on ( long - long ) collisions , by triggering on maximal number of participants @xmath77 . because of larger a and @xmath78 , the gain in energy density can realistically reach 35 - 40% @xcite , which is important e.g. for the @xmath48 suppression studies .",
    "the main finding of my recent studies of uu collisions @xcite is however a possible virtue of  parallel \" collisions , in which both long axis are orthogonal to the beam . using @xmath79 control parameters ,",
    "the number of participants and ellipticity , is proportional to this initial deformation ( with eos - depending coefficient ! ) and should have similar distribution . ]",
    ", one can effectively separate those . as one can see from fig.[fig_elliptic](b ) , unlike pbpb collisions , the uu ones provide a range of deformations , with long - to - short ratio reaching about 1.3 .",
    "( those correspond to collisions with two long directions parallel to each other and orthogonal to the beam ) .",
    "it is comparable to the deformation reached for mid - central collisions of spherical nuclei , but now for much larger and denser system .",
    "as mentioned several times in this talk , it may help to clarify many issues , such as presence of the qgp push in elliptic flow at sps , a time scale of the @xmath48 suppression , etc .",

    ". now excitation function of @xmath29 became an important issue , with a potential to see `` the qgp push '' at sps .",

    "*  the nature of the dilepton excess for @xmath80 found by na50 should be understood .",
