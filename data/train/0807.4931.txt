    "the correlation between the peak spectral energy  and the bolometric isotropic energy  emitted during the prompt ( the so called `` amati '' correlation , amati et al .",
    "2002 ) may be a key ingredient for our comprehension of the physics of gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "the proposed interpretations explain the  correlation as either due to geometric effects ( eichler & levinson 2004 ; toma , yamazaky & nakamura 2005 ) or to the radiative process responsible for the burst prompt emission ( thompson 2006 ; thompson , mszros & rees 2007 ) , though there is no unanimous consensus .",
    "in addition , there is no agreement about the reality of the correlation itself . indeed , nakar & piran ( 2005 ) and band & preece ( 2005 ) have pointed out the existence of outliers , while ghirlanda et al .",
    "( 2005a ) and bosnjak et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , considering an updated amati relation , found no new outliers besides grb 980425 and grb 031203 .",
    "more recently it has been argued that this correlation might be the result of selection effects related to the detection of grbs ( butler et al .",
    "2007 - hereafter b07 ) .",
    "the existence of an  correlation was predicted ( lloyd , petrosian & mallozzi 2000 ) before the finding of amati et al .",
    "the prediction was based on the existence of a significant correlation in the observer frame between the peak energy  and the bolometric fluence @xmath0 of a sample of  bursts .",
    "this finding has been recently confirmed by sakamoto et al .",
    "( 2008a ) using a sample of bursts detected by ,  and .",
    "in particular , they note that x - ray flashes and x - ray - rich satisfy and extend this correlation to lower fluences .",
    "amati et al .",
    "( 2002 ) discovered the   correlation with a sample of 12 bursts detected by  with spectroscopically measured redshifts .",
    "later updates ( e.g. lamb , donaghy & graziani 2005 ; amati et al .",
    "2006 ; ghirlanda et al . 2008  hereafter g08 ) confirmed it with larger samples . in the most recent updates ( 76 bursts in g08 and 83 in this paper ) the grbs with measured redshift and",
    "define a correlation @xmath3 , with only two outliers ( grb 980425 and grb 031203 , but see ghisellini et al .",
    "this last sample contains bursts detected by different instruments / satellites , i.e. , , ,  ( all operative in the so  called pre  era ) and , since 2005 ( mostly ) by .",
    "these instruments have different detection capabilities and also different operative energy ranges .    for these reasons",
    "is crucial to answer to the following question : is the   correlation real or is it an artifact of some selection / instrumental effect ?    to investigate this issue",
    "we should move to the observer frame plane corresponding to the amati relation ( i.e. the  plane ) where the instrumental selection effects act .",
    "there , we can place the  cuts \" corresponding to the instrumental selection effects and see if the distribution of the data points are affected by these cuts , or if , instead , they prefer to lie in specific regions of the plane , away from these cuts .",
    "there are two main selection effects : first , a burst must have a minimum flux to be triggered by a given instrument",
    ". this minimum flux can be converted ( albeit approximately ) to a fluence by adopting an average flux to fluence conversion ratio , as done in g08 .",
    "this is the minimum fluence a burst should have to be detected .",
    "we call it  trigger threshold \" , tt for short .",
    "secondly , we need a minimum fluence also to find  and the spectral shape .",
    "in fact we can have bursts that , although detectable , have too few photons around  to reliably determine  itself .",
    "consider also that the limited energy range of any detector inhibits the determination of   outside that range .",
    "we call it  spectral threshold \" ",
    "st .    while both selection effects are functions of we found that the latter is dominant for all the detectors .",
    "in g08 we considered a sample of 76 grbs with redshifts @xmath2 ( which we will call , for simplicity , @xmath2grb sample ) .",
    "these bursts define an amati correlation in the form @xmath4 , consistent with what found by previous works .",
    "moreover , g08 found that these bursts define a strong correlation also in the observer frame ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "we demonstrated that the st truncation effect is biasing the @xmath2grb sample of bursts ( i.e. bursts for which  has been determined from the fit of bat spectra ) while this is not the case for the no  @xmath2grbs ( i.e. bursts for which  has been determined from other instruments , namely , ,  and ) .",
    "this leaves open two possibilities : ( i ) if those described above are all the possible conceivable selection effects , the no  @xmath2grb sample represents an unbiased sample and , therefore , the  correlation defined with these bursts is real ; ( ii ) there are other selection effects biasing the sample of @xmath2grbs .",
    "for instance , the optical afterglow luminosity might be proportional to the burst fluence , resulting in a bias in favour of @xmath6ray bright bursts .",
    "another effect concerns the  bursts , that had to be localized by the wide field camera ( wfc ) of _ beppo_sax .",
    "although , formally , the tt for the wfc should not introduce any relevant truncation , in g08 we have shown that all bursts detected by the wfc ( with and without redshift or measurable ) had fluences much larger than its tt curve .    to proceed further ,",
    "in this paper we consider all bursts with measured , irrespective of having or not a measured redshift .",
    "with this enlarged sample we study if the distribution of grbs in the   plane is : ( i ) consistent or not with the correlation defined by the @xmath2grbs ; and ( ii ) if it is strongly biased or not by the considered selection effects .    besides using existing samples of bursts ( from , sakamoto et al .",

    "this is the   limiting fluence ( st ) which allows to derive a reliable  from the spectral analysis .",
    "we therefore have a complete , fluence limited , sample of  bursts .",
    "with this we can study if there is any  correlation and if it is a result of selection effects or not .    by the same token",

    "this correlation was first found by yonetoku et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , with a small number ( 16 ) of bursts , and was slightly tighter than the  correlation , and had the same slope",
    ". it will be interesting to see if this is still the case considering our sample of 83 @xmath2grbs .",

    "i suggests that they are extremely rare because , otherwise , they would have been easily detected by present and past grb detectors . the absence of bursts in region",
    " ii could be due to selection effects .",

    "different detectors / satellites ( cgro , , , , ) have been contributing the sample of grbs with measured @xmath2 and , possibly introducing different instrumental selection effects .",
    "g08 , by considering the trigger efficiency of these satellites ( from band 2003 ) , excluded that this is affecting the sample of 76 bursts defining the  correlation .",
    "however , a stronger selection effect was studied in g08 : to add a point in the   correlation , in addition to detect it , we need to determine ( through the spectral analysis ) the peak energy .",
    "this requires a minimum fluence .",
    "g08 simulated several spectra of grbs by assuming they are described by a band function .",

    "we can state that a given grb is @xmath64 inconsistent with the correlation , and quantify the probability of having a certain number of outliers lying  say  more than 3@xmath20 away . since the amati correlation , as discussed below , surely incorporates an extra  poissonian dispersion term ( amati , 2006 ) , the scatter distribution may not be a gaussian , but it may correspond to the distribution function of this extra term .",
