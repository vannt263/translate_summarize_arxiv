    "the production of strange particles in heavy - ion collisions is considered as one of the most important signals for the phase transition from hot , dense hadron gas ( hg ) to quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite .",
    "recently we have analyzed the production of strange hadrons over a broad energy range from ags to lhc energies using our new thermodynamically consistent excluded - volume model @xcite .",
    "we have suitably incorporated the attractive interactions between hadrons through the addition of hadron resonances in our model .",
    "we assign an equal hard - core radius to each baryon in order to include repulsive interactions between them while mesons in the model are treated as pointlike particles . using chemical freeze - out criteria as proposed by us",
    "@xcite , we calculate strange and non - strange hadron ratios and compare our results with the experimental data . we also study the production of light nuclei , hypernuclei and their antinuclei from ags to lhc energies using our model and confront our model predictions with the experimental results .",
    "moreover , we analyze the experimental data on rapidity distributions of various hadrons in terms of our model and elucidate the role of the longitudinal flow present in the medium formed in heavy - ion collisions . in the last , we present the conclusions and summary .",
    "the grand canonical partition function for baryons in our thermodynamically consistent excluded - volume model can be written as follows @xcite :    @xmath0},\\ ] ]    where @xmath1 is the degeneracy factor of ith species of baryons , @xmath2 is the energy of the ith particle ( @xmath3 ) , @xmath4 is the eigen volume assigned to each baryon of ith species .",
    "we have assigned an equal volume @xmath5 for each baryon with a hard - core radius @xmath6 .",
    "mesons in our model are considered as pointlike as they can penetrate each others volume .",
    "we have included all the baryons , mesons and their resonances having masses upto @xmath7 in our model . to ensure strangeness conservation , we have imposed the condition of strangeness neutrality by considering @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the strangeness of ith hadron .",
    "recently , gorenstein @xcite has criticized our model on the basis of thermodynamical and statistical consistency and claimed that the thermodynamical average of number of baryons is not equal to its statistical average in our model .",
    "we calculate these two averages in our model and find a relationship between them as follows @xcite : @xmath10 we see that the thermal average of number of baryons is not exactly equal to its statistical average in our model and an extra term appears because @xmath11 , present in the available volume ( @xmath12 ) , is a function of @xmath13 .",
    "we call this extra term as `` correction term '' and plotted this term and @xmath14 with respect to @xmath15 at constant @xmath16 in fig",
    "we find that `` correction term '' gives an almost negligible contribution and hence can be ignored .",
    "thus , our model can safely be considered as thermodynamically consistent @xcite .",
    "variation of thermodynamical average of the number density of baryons and the `` correction term '' with respect to @xmath15 at constant @xmath17 @xcite . ]    the rapidity distributions of baryons can be calculated using our thermal model as follows @xcite :    @xmath18 exp\\left(\\frac{-m_i\\;coshy}{t}\\right)\\big[m_i^2t+\\frac{2m_it^2}{coshy}+\\frac{2t^3}{cosh^2y}\\big].\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 is the mass of the ith species and @xmath20 is the freeze - out volume of the system . after incorporating the longitudinal flow in our thermal model",
    "the formula for the rapidity distributions of baryons takes the following form @xcite :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is a free parameter related with the longitudinal flow velocity ( @xmath23 ) @xcite .",
    "energy dependence of the @xmath24 , @xmath25 ratio at midrapidity .",

    "figure 2 represents the variation of @xmath26 ratio with respect to center - of - mass energies ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "we have compared our model results with that of other models @xcite and find that our model result is closer to experimental data in comparison to other models .",
    "we have shown the variations of the @xmath24 , @xmath25 ratio at midrapidity ( @xmath28 ) with @xmath27 in fig .",
    "we compare our results with the experimental data @xcite and statistical hadron gas model ( hgm ) @xcite .",
    "we find that our model provides a good description of the experimental data at lower energies but fails to describe the data at higher energies .",
    "hgm model , which has included the strangeness saturation factor @xmath29 to account for the partial equilibration of strangeness , describes the data well at the lower and upper energies while it completely disagrees with the experimental data at the intermediate energies .",
    "we also show the results of the hadronic transport model ultra - relativistic quantum molecular dynamical ( urqmd ) @xcite in which kaon coalescence mechanism is used for the production of @xmath30 .",
    "the predictions of urqmd lie well below the experimental data at all energies which suggests that this mechanism fails badly in explaining the production mechanism of @xmath30 .",

    "4 , we present the rapidity distribution of anti - proton ( @xmath31 ) for central @xmath32 collisions at @xmath33 over full rapidity range .",
    "dotted line shows the distribution of @xmath31 due to stationary thermal source which describes only the midrapidity data while it fails to describe the experimental data at other rapidities .",
    "solid line shows the rapidity distributions of @xmath31 after incorporation of the longitudinal flow in our thermal model and it gives a good agreement with the experimental data @xcite . after fitting the experimental data , we get the value of @xmath34 and hence the longitudinal flow velocity @xmath35 at @xmath33 . in fig . 5",
    ", we show the variations of @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 with @xmath27 .",
    "comparisons with the experimental data yield a good agreement between them @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we find that our model provides a good fit to the experimental data on ratios of hadron yields as well as mid - rapidity densities of various particles .",
    "we present an analysis of rapidity distributions of hadrons at various center - of - mass energies using our model .",
    "we see that our thermal model alone can not describe the experimental data fully unless we incorporate flow velocity in the longitudinal direction and as a result our modified model predictions show a good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "although , thermal model fails in case of multistrange particles which suggests that a somewhat different type of mechanism e.g. , coalescence model is required .",
    "further , we have analyzed the production of nuclei and hypernuclei in terms of our model which describe the experimental data very well .",
