    "in a recent communication m.m . block and f. halzen @xcite ( hereafter referred to as bh ) have presented some critical comments on our analysis @xcite ( hereafter fms ) .",
    "some points raised by these authors have already been addressed and discussed in our subsequent work @xcite ( hereafter fms2 ) , available as arxiv since august 16 , 2012 . in this note",
    "we reply to the bh criticisms directed to fms , recalling also some aspects of interest presented in fms2 .    first , to facilitate the discussion and the reference to each part of the bh commentaries , some explanations on the organization of this reply are in order . excluding the acknowledgments and references , bh arxiv comprises four pages and the effective criticisms to fms",
    "correspond to approximately one page .",
    "all the rest of the manuscript ( three pages ) largely overlap with their previous work @xcite ( as advised in the  arxiv admin note \" @xcite ) .",
    "we shall focus on this 25 % material , in our section [ s2 ] .",
    "although not characterized as criticisms , the rest of the bh reproduces their former work on the subject , as a kind of lesson to be learned . in this respect ,",
    "a discussion on some aspects of the fms analysis and a brief commentary on the bh former work are presented in section [ s3 ] .",
    "our conclusions and final remarks are the contents of section [ s4 ] .",
    "the content of the criticisms to fms , presented in bh , can be divided in three blocks , one block referring to the @xmath0 information ( page 1 in bh ) , another block referring to statistical probabilities ( page 2 ) and the last one to predictions at 7 tev ( page 2 ) . in",
    "what follows , each block will be treated as a subsection , in which we first situate and summarize the commentary , or quote it explicitly , and then present our reply .",
    "_ - commentary _",
    "the first effective criticism appears in page 1 , fourth paragraph of the section _ introduction_.",
    "it concerns the fact that in fms the @xmath0 information was not used in global fits with the total cross section data . according to them ,  a statement alluded to ( but _ not _ carried out ) in appendix ... \" .",
    "they also add :  ... in their appendix , they give a rather cumbersome evaluation using their variant 3 model , to _ separately evaluate _ @xmath0 .... \"    _ - our reply _    in fms , the analysis has been based only on the @xmath2 data ( without the inclusion of the @xmath0 information ) for the six reasons explained there , which we consider as six facts .",
    "however , addressing the comments by one of the _ three referees _ in the submission to the braz .",
    ", we have included appendix a in a revised version . in this appendix",
    "we have shown that , even in the case of the largest values of the exponent @xmath3 ( method 1 , v3 and method 2 , v5 ) , the _ predictions _ for @xmath4 are in agreement with the experimental information .    to connect @xmath5 and @xmath4 in an analytical way",
    ", we have used singly - subtracted derivative dispersion relations in the operational form introduced by kang and nicolescu @xcite ( also discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "in particular we have obtained an _ extended _ analytical result for the case of @xmath3 as a _ real _ parameter ( equations a7 and a8 in appendix a of fms ) .    in respect to the effect of the @xmath0 information in data reductions , we have stated at the end of appendix a ( the references that follows concern fms ) : ",
    "finally , we recall that in simultaneous fit to @xmath2 and @xmath0 the subtraction constant affects both the low- and high - energy regions [ 47,48 ] .",
    "that is a consequence of the strong correlation among the subtraction constant and all the other physical free fit parameters .",
    "we plan to discuss this consequence and other aspects of the fit procedures in a forthcoming paper . \"",
    "also , in the last paragraph of our conclusions ( third sentence ) we added :  these are aspects that we expect to consider in a future work , since they may provide information that is complementary to the results here presented . \"    in fact , in the fms2 we have extended the fms analysis in several aspects as referred to and outlined in the introduction of fms2 . in special , not only individual but also novel simultaneous fits to total cross section and @xmath0 information have been developed , leading to solutions with @xmath3 greater than 2 , _ despite the constraint involved_. the origin and role of the subtraction constant have also been discussed in some detail .",
    "therefore , we see no sense in depreciating statements like  alluded but not carried out \" or  they give a rather cumbersome evaluation \" .",
    "the second criticism in bh appears in page 2 , section _ statistical probabilities _ and involves five paragraphs , four with criticisms ( left column ) and the final one with the conclusions ( right column ) .",
    "the main point here concerns the use of the integrated probability @xmath6 to punctually analyze the reliability of the fit results .",
    "we shall treat each paragraph separately and in sequence .",
    "however , before that , some aspects on our fit procedures and on statistical analysis demand a few comments for further reference .",

    "they demand a methodology for the choice of the initial ( feedback ) values of the free parameters .",
    "our strategy has been to test a _ grid _ of different ( physical ) feedback values for the free fit parameters so as to check the stability of the results , as shortly recalled in what follows .    in both cases , fms and fms2 ,",
    "we have considered as feedback the results already found by the particle data group ( pdg ) , which uses the standard compete collaboration highest - rank parametrization ( @xmath3 = 2 , a fixed parameter ) @xcite . in fms",
    "we used the 2010 pdg edition @xcite and in fms2 the updated result from the 2012 pdg edition @xcite .",
    "although applied to only a _ subset _ of the dataset analyzed in pdg , we understand that with these  conservative choices \" ( @xmath3 = 2 ) , we start with reasonable stable solutions ( already found by the pdg ) . with this input",
    "we are then able to investigate possible _ departures from this solution _ in the case of @xmath3 as a free parameter ( including or not the totem datum @xcite , as done in fms and including this point in all fits , as done in fms2 ) . _ in addition _ , in order to investigate the effect of the feedback values in the fit results , we have considered another distinct choices in both fms and fms2 and 3 different versions in each case of fms ( referred to as six variants and a direct fit ) .    as explicitly quoted in fms and fms2 , our data reductions have been carried out with the objects of the class tminuit of the root framework @xcite .",
    "the statistical interpretations of the fit results , as well as aspects related to the error matrix , correlation matrix and analytical error propagation , have been based on the bevington - robinson book @xcite .    for further reference , we recall that the error ( or covariance ) matrix provides the variances ( diagonal ) and covariances ( out of diagonal ) associated with each free fit parameter . the symmetric correlation matrix gives a measure of the correlation between each pair of free parameter through a coefficient with numerical limits @xmath20 1 ( full correlation ) and 0 ( no correlation ) .    in the minimization program",
    "@xcite a confidence level of one standard deviation was adopted in all fits ( up = 1 ) . in each test of fit , successive",
    "running of the migrad have been considered ( up to 200 calls in fms and up to 2,000 calls in fms2 ) , until full convergence has been reached , with the smallest fcn ( @xmath21 ) and edm ( estimated distance to minimum ) , specifically edm @xmath22 ( adequate for the one sigma cl ) .",
    "in addition , the error in the parameters should not exceed the central value .    among _ several different tests _",
    ", we have _ selected _ , under the above criteria , the seven variants presented in fms . these variants are related to two different choices for the input values for all fits , denoted method 1 and method 2 in fms . for further reference and clarity , we summarize and situate below the structure of the grid considered in fms ( v stands for variant and df for direct fit , also a variant ) .    method 1 .",
    "initial feedback values from pdg 2010 ( table 1 , second column ) : @xmath23    method 2 .",
    "initial feedback values distinct from method 1 ( table 3 , second column ) : @xmath24    in the six variants ( including the df ) we have investigated the effects of fixing or not the three fundamental parameters directly related with the energy dependence , namely @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath3 . for the reggeon intercepts we have tested either _ ad hoc _ fixed values 1/2 or fixed ( central ) values from spectroscopic data ( chew - frautschi plots ) .",
    "we stress that these results constitute final solutions , selected under the above mentioned criteria .",
    "therefore our strategy in fms ( and fms2 ) did not involve extremely detailed use of different routines to possibly reach an absolute minimum .",
    "our point has been to investigate a _ grid _ of reasonable physical choices for feedbacks and variants for two ensembles , obtaining solutions through standard running of the minuit . despite of these possible limitations",
    ", we have found several reasonable consistent solutions with @xmath3 greater than 2 and that has been the only essential point raised in fms ( and developed also in fms2 )",
    ".    - _ on statistics _    in fms and fms2 ,",
    "following the pdg procedure , the dataset include statistical and _ systematic errors _ , added in quadrature . in our opinion ,",
    "the inclusion of systematic errors puts certain limits in a _ full _ statistical interpretation of the fit results .",
    "in fact , the @xmath21 test for goodness of fit is based on the assumption of a _",
    "gaussian error distribution _ @xcite .",
    "although statistical uncertainties are considered to follow this distribution , that , certainly , is not the case for systematic uncertainties , which are equally probable quantities .",
    "therefore , we understand that a _ full _ statistical interpretation of data reductions including systematic uncertainties has a somewhat limited validity , specially in what concerns integrated probability ( due to the inclusion of equally probable quantities ) .    in the fms and fms2 , the corresponding dof ( @xmath25 ) and @xmath26 for each fit has been displayed only to shown that they constitute reasonable ( acceptable ) statistical results .",
    "the condition of reduced @xmath21 closest to 1.0 has been one of the criteria used to select a given result , but not the only one .",
    "attempts to a full statistical interpretation of the results , mainly in terms of integrated probabilities , may lead to questionable conclusions , as discussed in what follows .",
    "at last , it is important to note that the focus in fms does not concern comparison among models ( or variants ) , but between two ensembles , with or without the totem datum . also ,",
    "when we refer to _ statistically consistent results _ for @xmath3 = 2 or @xmath3 above 2 , we mean that _ the corresponding numerical result for @xmath3 is consistent within their uncertainty_.    let us now treat each paragraph from section _ statistical probabilities _ in bh .",
    "we shall adopt here their notation ( lower index 1 for the @xmath27 = 1.8 tev ensemble and lower index 2 for the @xmath27 = 7 tev ensemble ) .",
    "@xmath7 first paragraph    - commentary    bh discuss our results in table 1 of fms ( @xmath27 = 1.8 tev ) , comparing the data reductions that can be summarized as follows :    df@xmath28 : @xmath29 @xmath25 = 156 , @xmath29 @xmath26 = 0.931 , @xmath29 @xmath30 = 0.721,@xmath29 case of @xmath3 = 2 ( fixed )    @xmath31v1 : @xmath29 @xmath25 = 155 , @xmath29 @xmath26 = 0.937 , @xmath29 @xmath32 = 0.701 , @xmath29 case of @xmath3 free    according to block and halzen :  ... we get the somewhat strange result that fms have a _ ... better , somewhat more reliable _",
    "fit when they fix the value of @xmath3 at 2 , ... , than they allow it to float , suggesting perhaps that the _ true _",
    "minimum @xmath21 was not achieved in their minimization process . \"",
    "they state in the last sentence :  in any event , fms concluded that the value @xmath3 = 2 was correct for the energy interval 5 @xmath33 1,800 gev . \"    - our reply :    the v1 result has been obtained from df@xmath28 as feedback .",
    "based on bevington and robinson @xcite ( chapter 11 ) and in our above comments on statistics , for @xmath34 155/156 we do not think that @xmath35 0.72 @xmath36 @xmath37 0.70 strictly implies in a better fit , namely that df@xmath28 could be  more reliable \" than v1 .",
    "in fact , let us compare the values of the free parameters in both fits in table 1 of fms ( third and fourth columns ) .",
    "note that the central values of the parameters are identical up to 3 figures , except for @xmath16 ( 0.264 and 0.263 ) and @xmath19 ( 12.0 and 12.2 ) .",
    "all the parameters in both fits are consistent within their errors , leading to the conclusion that both results are , effectively , equivalent ( the corresponding curves in figures 1 and 2 of fms overlap ) .",
    "we understand that in this nonlinear fit , based on the same dataset ( @xmath27 = 1.8 tev ) , to let free _ only one parameter _ ( @xmath3 ) does not allow the punctual statistical interpretation by block and halzen ( we shall return to this point in the discussion on the fourth paragraph ) .",
    "the very small differences in the central values of the parameters , and those in the errors , are associated with the _ correlations among all the fit parameters _ , resulting , in this particular case , in a small decrease of the probability when @xmath3 is let free .",
    "the correlation coefficients associated with both fits are displayed in table [ t1 ] : df@xmath28 above the diagonal of the table and v1 below the diagonal ( we shall return to this point in what follows ) .",
    "perhaps there can be some small differences in reaching a true minimum , but , in our opinion , that does not invalidate our results and interpretation .",
    ".correlation coefficients from the ( symmetric ) correlation matrices @xcite associated with df@xmath28 and v1@xmath28 results .",
    "the off - diagonal coefficients from df@xmath28 are displayed above the diagonal of the table ( not filled ) and those from v@xmath28 , below that diagonal . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ t3 ]    from figure 1 , the _ predictions _ by the compete 2002 and pdg 2010 are in agreement with the totem result , but not the data reduction from the pdg 2012 , which includes this point in the updated dataset : the curve and uncertainty region lie below the totem lower uncertainty bar , _ corroborating _ , therefore , _ the results and conclusions previously presented in fms_. note also that these results ( figure 1 ) corroborate another conclusion in fms , relating the totem point with the highest cosmic - ray estimates for the @xmath1 total cross section ( fly s eye collaboration @xcite and pierre auger collaboration @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , in what concerns our fit results with the amaldi _",
    "_ parametrization ( and in the particular case of figure 1 with @xmath3 = 2 , namely the compete highest - rank result ) , there is no agreement among these three points : curves in consistency with the totem datum lie above the central values of the cosmic - ray estimations and the same is true in the inverse sense .",
    "based on all these facts , we understand that , once included in the dataset , it is , at least , not obvious the 7 tev totem result can be described by a standard @xmath38 $ ] leading dependence and that was the essential  discovery \" in fms . from our analysis ,",
    "this effect is related with the fundamental correlation between @xmath3 and the scale factor @xmath19 ( and also with the subtraction constant @xmath39 in case of simultaneous fits to @xmath2 and @xmath0 data : see appendix a in fms2 on the correlation matrices ) .",
    "note , from table [ t3 ] , that in the compete case , @xmath40 34 gev@xmath12 and in the pdg 2012 edition , @xmath40 16 gev@xmath12 ( below , therefore , @xmath41 25 gev@xmath12 ) : the effect of these differences can be seen in fig .",
    "1 . in particular , _ once included in the dataset _ , it is not expected the 7 tev totem datum might be described for fixed @xmath3 = 2 and @xmath42 , as is the case in bh .",
    "the totem collaboration has already obtained three new high - precision measurements of the total cross section at 7 tev , through different methods and techniques @xcite .",
    "all the measurements are consistent within their uncertainties and therefore confirm the first result they have obtained ( which has been used in fms and fms2 ) . in this respect , we can advance that the inclusion of these three points in our dataset leads also to solutions with @xmath3 greater than two @xcite , corroborating the conclusions in fms .",
    "however , the asymptotic ratio between elastic / total - cross - section , discussed in fms2 , is still under investigation .",
    "a luminosity - independent measurement at 8 tev has been also reported , indicating @xmath43 101.6 @xmath20 2.9 mb @xcite .",
    "this value lies above the prediction in fms2 , namely 98.7 @xmath20 1.0 mb , for @xmath3 = 2.346 @xmath20 0.013 and @xmath19 = 0.383 @xmath20 0.041 gev@xmath12 @xcite .    at this point",
    ", we could conjecture ( if not speculating ) on the implication of a possible increase of @xmath2 faster than @xmath44 .",
    "in contrast with an effective violation of the froissart - martin bound , a fast rise of the total cross section might also be associated with some local effect at the lhc energy region , so that , asymptotically , the bound remains valid .",
    "a faster - than - squared - logarithm rise points also to the possibility of a power - like behavior @xcite , which has always been and important and representative approach ( see , for example , the unitarized model @xcite ) .",
    "these conjectures are not in disagreement with the recent theoretical arguments by azimov @xcite .      here",
    "we present some critical comments on the bh parametrization , the aspen model and the bh results for the total , elastic and inelastic cross sections .",
    "the bh analytical parametrization for the total cross sections , used in global fits to @xmath2 and @xmath0-values from @xmath1 ( + ) and @xmath10 ( - ) scattering , reads @xcite    @xmath45^{\\mu - 1 }    \\ , \\pm \\ , \\delta \\ , \\left[\\frac{\\nu}{m}\\right]^{\\alpha - 1 } + c_0\\ , + c_1\\ , \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\nu}{m}\\right)\\ , + c_2\\ , \\ln^2 \\left(\\frac{\\nu}{m}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    [ eq2 ] where @xmath25 is the laboratory energy , @xmath46 is the proton mass and , in terms of the c.m .",
    "energy , @xmath47 .",
    "comparison with the parametrization used in fms , eq .",
    "( 1 ) , shows that , for @xmath3 = 2 ( fixed ) , both forms have the same _ analytical structure_. however , the striking difference between fms and bh approaches concerns the number of fixed and free parameters and mainly , in the bh case , the way the parameters are fixed , as discussed in what follows .    in the fms analysis , except for a dimensional notation choice , namely @xmath11 = 1 gev@xmath12 , all the 8 parameters involved have been treated as free or fixed in the 6 variants considered .",
    "that is , there is no _ ad hoc _ fixed parameters , except for particular variant tests . in all cases ,",
    "the uncertainties in the free parameters have been explicitly given .",
    "moreover , by letting free different parameters in a _ nonlinear _ fit , we are able to investigate all the correlations involved , the variances , covariances and , as a consequence , the global uncertainties in all fitted and predicted quantities , as done in fms2 .    in the bh approach , besides the arbitrary fixed energy scale ( corresponding to @xmath48 at both low and high energy regions ) , among the 7 parameters in eq .",
    "( 2 ) , 5 are fixed ( without uncertainties ) and only 2 are free in data reductions .",
    "specifically , from table iii in @xcite :    - fixed parameters : @xmath49 = 31.10 mb , @xmath50 = 0.5 , @xmath51 = - 28.56 mb , @xmath15 = 0.415 and @xmath52 = 37.32 mb ;    - fitted parameters : @xmath53 = - 1.440 @xmath20 0.070 mb and @xmath54 = 0.2817 @xmath20 0.0064 mb .    as a consequence ,",
    "the parametrization is linear in any reduction to @xmath2 data , leading to unique solution @xcite .",
    "that , obviously , contrasts with eq .",
    "( 1 ) and with the strategies in fms and fms2 , as commented above .    in bh the reggeons intercepts are fixed , corresponding to @xmath17 = 0.5 and @xmath18 = 0.585 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , which is not in agreement with the spectroscopic data ( chew - frautschi plots ) and scattering fit results , as obtained by several authors @xcite .",
    "since this assumption permeated the intermediate and low energy region , in our opinion , it puts some limits on the reliability of a formal connection with the finite energy sum rules at low energy .",
    "the fixed parameters do not allow the study of correlations and their effects in the fitted and , most importantly , in the predicted quantities .",
    "we shall return to this point in the next subsection on the aspen model .",
    "we also note that , although ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) have the same analytical structure , the bh and fms high energy formulations for @xmath3 = 2 are not equivalent , even in the cases ( variants ) with @xmath17 and @xmath18 fixed .",
    "in fact , in fms all the other parameters are free and the fit extends _ simultaneously _ to both low- and high - energy data ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 contributions in fms ) . as a consequence there",
    "is strong correlations among the parameters from both @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( see , for example , the v4@xmath28 coefficients in table ii in the case of @xmath13 and @xmath19 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) .",
    "since that is not the case in bh formulation ( @xmath49 and @xmath51 , corresponding to @xmath13 and @xmath14 , are fixed ) , we see no correspondence between the high energy formulations , as stated in bh ( after eq .",
    "( 7 ) in that paper ) .",
    "in the bh approach the main hypothesis concerns the imposing that  the fits to the high energy data smoothly join the cross section and energy dependence obtained by averaging the resonances at low energy \" @xcite . in the fms analysis , on the contrary ,",
    " we have tried to identify possible high - energy effects that may be unrelated to the trends of the lower - energy data ... \" @xcite .",
    "therefore , the assumptions , approaches and strategies in fms and bh are completely different .",
    "we see no reason for the comparative discussion presented in bh .      in the aspen model @xcite two fundamental quantities ,",
    "the mass scale @xmath57 and the coupling constant @xmath58 , are unknown parameters , fixed to _ ad hoc _ values of 600 mev and 0.5 , respectively in order to obtain best fits in data analysis .",
    "the @xmath59 parameter , from the gluon structure function , is also fixed at 0.05 .",
    "the two fundamental parameters , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , have been reinterpreted by luna _ et al .",
    "_ in the context of a dynamical gluon mass ( dgm ) approach @xcite . that has allowed connections with nonperturbative qcd , as expected in the soft sector represented by the elastic scattering processes . in the dgm approach ,",
    "two essential parameters are the dynamical gluon mass scale @xmath60 and the soft pomeron intercept @xmath59 . more recently and most important for our purposes , fagundes ,",
    "luna , menon and natale ( flmn ) have developed a detailed analysis on the influence in the evaluated quantities associated with physical intervals for the @xmath60 and @xmath59 parameters @xcite .",
    "moreover , in a similar way as done recently by achilli _",
    "@xcite , flmn have established bounds and uncertainty regions in all evaluated quantities ( fitted and predicted ) , in accordance with the relevant physical intervals for @xmath60 and @xmath59 .",
    "the main conclusion is that the uncertainty regions play a crucial role in the energy region above that used in the data reductions . in other words ,",
    "the relevant intervals for each parameters affect substantially the high - energy predictions and they can not be fixed at _ ad hoc _ values , without a clear physical justification .",
    "the above conclusion , expressed in @xcite , puts serious limits on the predictions of phenomenological models constructed on the basis of fixed parameters , whose numerical values do not have an explicit justification and/or whose _ consequences in the evaluated quantities are not investigated or even discussed_. in our opinion , these limitations are present in the foundations of both the bh analytical parametrization and the aspen model .      in order to connect their global analytical ( empirical )",
    "fits to @xmath2 and @xmath0 data with the inelastic cross section , @xmath61 , block and halzen use the predictions from the aspen model , in a kind of hybrid approach ( semi - empirical or perhaps semi - phenomenological ) @xcite .",
    "the model prediction is parametrized by an analytic expression ( eq .",

    "as commented in fms2 , we understand that the least ambiguous way to estimate the inelastic cross section is through the s - channel unitarity , @xmath61 = @xmath2 - @xmath63 , as has been done by the totem collaboration @xcite . that avoids the model dependence involved in direct estimation of @xmath61 , due to single and double diffraction contributions .    in this respect",
    ", it may be interesting to note the prediction in bh for the inelastic cross secion at 7 tev ( fig . 3 in @xcite ) : the uncertainty region barely reaches the lower error bar in the totem result .",
    "moreover , for the total cross section , the central value of the prediction reaches the low extreme bar of the totem result ( and the uncertainty region , above the central value , lies through the lower error bar of the totem point ) .",
    "it should be also noted that as a one - channel eikonal formalism , the aspen model does not take explicit account of the inelastic diffractive contributions .    in what concerns the bh total cross section prediction at 57 tev and the recent estimation of this quantity by the pierre auger collaboration @xcite ,",
    "we stress a peculiar statement in @xcite ( also present in @xcite ) :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  in particular , the agreement with the new highest energy ( 57 tev ) experimental measurement of both @xmath2 and @xmath61 is striking . \" _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    first , certainly these are not _ experimental measurements _ , due to the strong model dependence involved , as already discussed by several authors and also in @xcite .",
    "they constitute estimations of these quantities because they are based on extrapolations from models tested only in lower energies . moreover ,",
    "recall that the estimation for the @xmath1 total cross section at 57 tev reads @xcite    @xmath64\\ , \\mathrm{mb } $ ] .    as discussed in fms2",
    "( and also in our section ii.b ) , systematic and , here , theoretical ( glauber ) uncertainties are equally probable quantities ( do not follow a gaussian distribution ) .",
    "that means the above central value is equally likely to lie in any place limited by the corresponding nonstatistical uncertainties , namely around @xmath20  23 mb .",
    "therefore , we see no physical meaning in a statement referring to a  striking agreement \" .    at last",
    ", we understand that the bh analysis and the aspen model represent important contributions in the investigation of the high - energy elastic hadron scattering",
    ". however , given the model character and _ ad hoc _ assumptions involved we see no conclusive evidence that the bh results constitute an unique and exclusive solution for the rise of the total cross section at high energies . in this respect , a reanalysis by block and halzen , including in their dataset the four high - precision totem measurements and presenting their linear fit prediction at higher energies , might be instructive .",
    "in fms we have presented a study on the rise of the total hadronic cross section , with focus on the recent 7 tev totem result .",
    "the analysis was based on a specific class of analytical parameterization , eq .",
    "since the effects of all parameters involved have been considered , we were faced with a nonlinear data reduction , which constitutes a non - trivial problem .",
    "our strategy in fms ( and fms2 ) has been to investigate a grid of different physical choices for feedbacks and the corresponding solutions . in both fms and fms2 , beyond a second distinct possibility , we have considered  conservative \" choices for the initial values , namely results previously obtained by the pdg with @xmath3 = 2 .",
    "the data reductions have been developed through standard running of the minuit , namely the default minuit error analysis .",
    "perhaps , in the fits presented in fms a true minimum had not been reached in some cases .",
    "we understand that this does not invalidate the _ general and global conclusions _ from our  grid strategy \" approach ( summarized in section ii and , the corresponding results , in fig . 8 of fms ) .",
    "anyway , further analysis , looking for optimizations in the use of the minuit code , including also tests with other computational tools for nonlinear fits ( as the subroutine minos @xcite ) , are certainly important and we intend to implement that .",
    "the lack of unique solutions in our nonlinear fit procedures has been referred to in fms and fms2 .",
    "we have never claimed to have obtained _ unique or absolute solutions_. in particular , we have concluded in fms ( the equations refer to that paper ) ,    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  from our data reductions through parametrization ( 3 - 5 ) to @xmath1 and @xmath10 scattering above 5 gev , including the 7 tev totem result , we conclude that the total hadronic cross section may rise faster than @xmath44 at high energies . \" _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  our results suggest that the energy dependence of the hadronic total cross section at high energies still constitutes an open problem . \" _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    and in fms2 we have stressed ,    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  we also emphasize that our results represent possible consistent statistical solutions for the behavior of the total cross section , but do not correspond to unique solutions . \" _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    it is important to note that at the highest energies , once treated as free fit parameters , the exponent @xmath3 and the scale factor @xmath19 are correlated in nonlinear data reductions . in the lack of formal and/or theoretical information on the value of this scale factor and without the _ canonical assumption _",
    "@xmath3 = 2 , different solutions , in agreement with the experimental data , can be obtained for the leading @xmath65 contribution .",
