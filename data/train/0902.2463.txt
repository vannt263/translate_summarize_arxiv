    "so the bosonic rvb picture is a natural choice for describing af heisenberg model .",

    ", we should generalize the idea of _ spin - charge separation _ , which has become a very basic concept in understanding the doped mott insulator related to high-@xmath2 cuprate@xcite . unlike a usual quasi - particle that carries both spin and charge quantum numbers in conventional metals ,",
    "it states that the system has two independent elementary excitations , the neutral spinon and the spinless holon .",
    "it is assumed that usual quasi - particle excitations may no longer be stable against the spin - charge separation mechanism once being created , e.g. , by injecting a bare vacancy into the system ; and it has to decay into more elementary spinons and holons . in other words , to theoretically describe the introduction of a single vacancy , one has to first annihilate a particle state @xmath44 together with a bosonic spinon @xmath45 , then generate a spinless operator @xmath46 denotes a holon ( a vacancy ) as @xmath47 in addition , @xmath46 and @xmath45 should satisfy the no - double - occupancy constraint , @xmath48 . in contract to the case of high-@xmath2 cuprates , holons in bosonic @xmath0-@xmath1 model are neutral for they are actually the absence of cold atoms in a certain site .",
    "however , the situation changes when the hole moves . according to marshall@xcite , the ground - state wave function of the heisenberg hamiltonian for a bipartite lattice satisfies a sign rule .",
    "it requires that flips of two antiparallel spins at nearest - neighbor sites are always accompanied by a sign change in the wave function : @xmath49 . to show the sign effect in detail ,",
    "we divide a bipartite lattice into odd ( @xmath50 ) and even ( @xmath51 ) sublattices and assign an extra sign @xmath52 to every down spin at @xmath50 site .",
    "when the hole initially locating at site @xmath9 hops onto a nearest - neighbor site @xmath53 , the marshall sign rule is violated , resulting in a string of mismatched signs on the vacancy s course@xcite .",
    "the spin wave function is changed into@xmath54where @xmath55 is the number of down spin on each @xmath50-sublattice .",
    "in particular , if the hole moves through a closed path @xmath56 on the lattice to return to its original position , it will get a berry phase @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the total number of down spins encountered  by the hole on the closed path @xmath56.@xcite this process is illustrated in fig .",
    "( [ meron]a ) .    to deal with this unavoidable berry phase @xmath57 in the ground - state wave function when",
    "there is mobile hole , we introduce a phase - string transformation@xcite @xmath59 , where @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are occupation number operators of the hole and down - spins , with a phase factor @xmath63@xmath64 $ ] . here @xmath65 denotes position and the subscripts @xmath9 and @xmath53 denote lattice sites . considering the single - occupancy constraint , @xmath66 $ ] , where @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "the phase - shift factor @xmath69 can also be regarded as a unitary transformation on an arbitrary operator : @xmath70 .",
    "for example , operators of holons @xmath46 and spinons @xmath45  are transformed as follow , @xmath71now we have restored the simple spin wave function @xmath72 as equation ( [ wave function ] ) originally defined , but have got a set of nontrivial  operators , and it is just the aim of the above transformation .    furthermore , by defining @xmath73 , we can see that except for a phase factor @xmath74 , holon @xmath75 and spinon @xmath45  are symmetric , @xmath76namely , @xmath77 and @xmath78 the phase factor @xmath74 means an additional lattice @xmath79-flux - per - plaquette for holons . from equation ( [ t ] )",
    ", one can see that there exists a mutual semionic statistics between holons and spinons , where holons perceive spinons as @xmath28-vortices and vice versa .",
    "in particular , after the transformation @xmath80 , @xmath81 obeys fermionic _ _  _ _ anti - commutation@xcite , @xmath82    finally , based on the rvb ground state by considering the phase string effect@xcite , the effective hamiltonian of holons in bosonic @xmath0-@xmath1 model can be written as@xmath83where @xmath84 is the effective hopping amplitude of holons , @xmath85 is the chemical potential .",

    "however , the answer is not quite right .",
    "for a single meron configuration , the energy is logarithmically divergent , @xmath100 with @xmath101 the size of the system . in order to remove this infinite - energy cost , as in the present case",
    ", each holon - meron has to nucleatean anti - meron from the background spontaneously .",

    "spin configuration at a sufficiently large distance is obtained , @xmath109thus , each pair of holons and anti - merons forms a composite , as shown in fig .",
    "( [ meron]c ) .",
    "in contrast to the logarithmically divergent meron - energy , the energy a dipole @xmath110 becomes finite@xcite , @xmath111 $ ] , @xmath112 .",
    "physically , one may consider a bare hole ( spinless holon ) created by anannihilation operator @xmath113 at point @xmath114 , then it may jump to point @xmath115 via some discrete steps , being connected by a phase string in between .",
    "since the holon can reach @xmath115 through different virtual paths originated at @xmath114 , this singular phase string is then replaced by , or relaxes to , a smooth _ dipole _ configuration .",
    "an anti - meron itself is a semi - vortex formed by condensed spinons and it is immobile .",
    "therefore , the hole - dipole as a whole must remain localized ( self - trapped ) in space .",
    "the resulting spin configuration has a dipolar symmetry while the distortion of the direction of magnetization is long ranged and decays as @xmath116kou1,kou2 .",
    "in the lightly doped region , @xmath117 , there exist localized holes that are self - trapped around anti - merons via a logarithmically confining potential @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and their dipolar moments are randomly distributed .",
    "such kind of af ordered state with random dipoles has been studied in refs .",
    "it is known that when @xmath120 , the spin - correlation length is finite for arbitrary doping @xmath121 .",
    "this implies the destruction of long - range af order , as long as @xmath122 .",
    "consequently , af order is limited mainly in finite sizes , where the size @xmath123 of a domain is determined by the hole s concentration , @xmath124 .",
    "accordingly , this state has been termed as a cluster spin glass@xcite .",
    "the spin glass freezing temperature is then expected to vary as @xmath125 , below which holons tend to form a glass and their dynamics strongly slows down .    when doping  increases , more and more dipoles appear . as a result",
    ", the confining  potential @xmath126 between these dipoles will be screened by polarizations of pairs lying between them .",
    "when this screening effect becomes so strong that even the largest pair has to break up , holons and anti - merons are liberated to move individually .",
    "this qualitative analysis suggests that a localization - delocalization phase transition should occur at a critical point @xmath127 , in a fashion of the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition . using the renormalization group method@xcite",
    ", one can determine the critical hole density @xmath128 or temperature @xmath129 at which dipoles collapse and holon - merons are deconfined  from the bound state with anti - merons .",
    "at zero temperature , the critical hole density has been numerically determined as @xmath130therefore , a zero - temperature quantum critical point exists at @xmath131 where hole - dipoles dissolve into holon - merons and anti - merons .",
    "when @xmath132 , fermionic holons are delocalized , so a fermi surface emerges in the momentum space . and",
    "since two holons always _ repulse _ each other , for they are merons with _ same _ topological charges , then these fermions can not pair with each other and it makes the fermi surface stable .",
    "this is different from the case where electrons form cooper pairs in superconductors , because here we have topological repulsions not electronic repulsions .",
    "thus , we display the global phase - diagram of bosonic @xmath0-@xmath1 model in fig .",
    "there exists three different regions globally : region i , af  insulator , @xmath133 ; region ii , insulating spin - glass ( sg ) , @xmath134 ; region iii , topological fermi - liquid ( tfl ) phase with spin - liquid ground state , @xmath135 .",
    "the phase boundary that protects the physics in low doping regimes can be written as @xmath136 is an integration quantity ( see methods ) .",
    "particularly , our results illustrate the emergence of an exotic fermionic state ( tfl ) in a pure bosonic system .    .",
    "different regions are demonstrated in the text .",
    "the inset depicts detailed phase boundaries as well as the quantum critical point @xmath137 in low doping region ( @xmath138 ) .",

    "it is scaled by the superexchange energy @xmath1 as shown in the inset , where we have chosen @xmath140 , namely , @xmath141 and @xmath142.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in tfl state , the effective hamiltonian of holons can be written as @xmath143and the dispersion relation is @xmath144 + \\delta ^{2}},\\]]as fig .",
    "( [ dispersion ] ) shows .    in fig .",
    "( [ fermi surfaces ] ) , we show the evolution of fermi surfaces by plotting four doping cases , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 , respectively . from the global phase diagram fig . ( 3 ) and fig .",
    "( [ fermi surfaces ] ) , we suggest that in experiments people may observe tfl in bosonic @xmath0-@xmath1 model of @xmath149 hole concentration , of which highest fermi energy with clear fermi surfaces are predicted .     of the upper branch",
    "is shown in the unit of @xmath0 with @xmath150.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]        besides , when  holon moves , the spin configuration changes simultaneously , thus there is no long - range af order anymore .",
    "instead , the magnetic ground - state becomes a spin liquid state with invariant spin - rotation and translation symmetry . without anti - merons matching with holons ,",
    "holons exert an effective magnetic field  on spinons ( recall the mutual relation between the two excitations ) , @xmath151 with @xmath152 the density of holons .",
    "hence , a new length scale is introduced to the spinon system , which is the magnetic cyclotron length @xmath153 .",
    "@xmath154 will later be connected to the remaining magnetic correlation length .",
    "as we mentioned above , doping creates a landau - level structure in the spinon spectrum .",
    "thus , low - lying spin fluctuations are expected to be sensitive to dopants .",
    "after calculations , we find @xmath155here @xmath156 is defined as ( @xmath157 ) @xmath158where @xmath159 is the spin - spin correlation function . this is a gaussian type around the af wave - vector @xmath160 with a width @xmath161 .",
    "consequently , it determines the spin - spin correlation in the real space as @xmath162 , where the correlation length @xmath163 is in the same order of the average hole - hole distanceweng .",
    "namely , doped holes break up the long - range af correlation into short - range af fragments within a length scale of @xmath123 .",
    "in contrast , the ground - state of fermionic @xmath0-@xmath1 model is a superconducting state of condensed holons , in which spin liquid state is always masked by holons condensation@xcite . while in bosonic @xmath0-@xmath1 model",
    ", it is the topological fermi liquid state with massless fermionic excitations , in which one can easily detect properties of this spin liquid state . for these reasons ,",
    "the observation of this exotic quantum state ( tfl with short range spin correlation ) in bosonic @xmath0-@xmath1 model may pave an alternative approach to verify the microscopic theory of high @xmath2 superconductivity .",
    "in region i and ii , the system is an insulator in the first place , so the momentum distribution is universal and isotropic in the brillouin zone ( without considering the trapping and boundary conditions ) .",
    "this feature can be detected by measuring density profile measurement@xcite , or via bragg spectroscopy@xcite to observe the momentum spectrum .",
    "additionally , in the nel state ( i ) , the condensate exhibits long range af order , while in the spin glass state ( ii ) , this long ranged magnetic order disappears .",
    "this difference can be distinguished through spatial spin - spin correlations , @xmath164 . as demonstrated in refs.@xcite , using a probe laser beam which goes through the condensate , one can measure the phase shift or change of polarization of the outgoing beam @xmath165 to obtain the magnetization @xmath166 , where @xmath167 is the spatial intensity profile of the laser beam .",
    "the quantum noise @xmath168 reveals the atomic correlations in the system .",
    "this method can directly examine the existence of 2d af correlations .    in region iii",
    ", we have demonstrated that one natural characteristic of tfl is the existence of fermi surfaces in the brillouin zone .",
    "esslinger et al.@xcite had successfully observed the fermi surface in a 3d optical lattice filled with fermionic atoms .",
    "similarly , one may also observe these fermi levels in our bosonic system , as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fermi surfaces ] ) .",
    "besides , the short - range af fluctuations may also be observed .",
    "as equation ( [ spin correlation ] ) indicates , the spin dynamic structure factor as well as the dynamic spin susceptibility function are linked with spin - spin correlations .",
    "the latter one reflects the effective short - range magnetic correlation length @xmath123 .    to sum up , in this paper",
    ", we first demonstrate the implementation of bosonic @xmath0-@xmath1 model in optical superlattices filled with a two - component bec . and for the first time , we systematically discussed the possible quantum phases of this model upon doping .",
    "a key feature is the mutual semionic statistics between the two elementary excitations of the system , holons and spinons .",
    "when there are only a few holes around , they tend to form hole - dipoles , locally changing the underlying spin texture into meron - anti - meron pairs . at low doping",
    ", the deformed spin configuration loses the long - range order , and there emerges a spin glass state .",
    "when holes are prevailing , through a quantum phase transition ( @xmath169 )  that frees those self - localized holons in spin glass state , a strange topological fermi liquid with fermi surface appears in a purely bosonic system , as a significant result of the mutual statistics between holons and spinons .",
    "we also list accessible experimental approaches to verify and detect these novel theoretical predictions .",
    "the two - component bose - hubbard model in a biased superlattice can be generally written as@xmath171 +   \\notag \\\\ & & u\\sum_{i}\\hat{n}_{i\\uparrow } \\hat{n}_{i\\downarrow } + \\frac{u^{\\prime } } { 2}% \\sum_{i}\\hat{n}_{i\\sigma } \\left ( \\hat{n}_{i\\sigma } -1\\right ) ,   \\label{bh1}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath172@xcite with atomic recoil energy @xmath173 , @xmath174 is the wave vector of laser , @xmath175 is the atomic mass , @xmath24 describes external potential .",
    "the inter - species repulsion is defined as @xmath176 with @xmath177 the @xmath178-wave scattering length among species , and the intra - species repulsion is @xmath179 , @xmath180 is the corresponding scattering length .",
    "this term vanishes at exact unit - filling , but can contribute in higher - order tunneling processes .    in the large @xmath170 limit ( @xmath181 ) and nearly unit - filling @xmath182 , which is actually a prerequisite for building the aforementioned superlattices and",
    "is naturally satisfied , the hopping term can be treated as a perturbation .",
    "thus , we introduce two projection operator : @xmath183 projects the initial hilbert space onto the single - occupancy subspace ( @xmath184 ) , @xmath185 projects onto the double - occupancy subspace ( @xmath186 ) .",
    "we further divide equation ( [ bh1 ] ) into @xmath187 , where @xmath188 describes processes in @xmath189 subspace and @xmath190 mixes the upper and lower band via virtual tunnelings .",
    "applying canonical transformation @xmath191 and eliminating first order terms of @xmath190 , we find @xmath192 , \\\\ \\hat{s } & = & \\sum_{mn}\\left\\vert m\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle m\\right\\vert \\left ( \\frac{\\hat{t}_{\\text{mix}}}{e_{n}-e_{m}}\\right ) \\left\\vert n\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle n\\right\\vert .\\end{aligned}\\]]the projector @xmath193 can be chosen as @xmath183 and @xmath194 .",
    "energy differences between upper and lower band are @xmath195 thus @xmath196 with @xmath197 , @xmath198 . after calculating the detailed terms , we can obtain the effective hamiltonian as @xmath199 ,   \\label{heff1}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath200when @xmath177 and @xmath180 do not differ very much ( this condition can somehow be realized in experiments ) , @xmath201with @xmath202 denoting a small spatial inhomogeneity .",
    "in fact , this small inhomogeneity is necessary in our following discussions , for it can be seen as an analogy for the effective inter - layer - coupling in high-@xmath2 cuprates .    at the first glance",
    ", it seems that bosons ( say , @xmath203 ) in shallow sites may hop to neighboring deep sites more easily due to lower  energy barrier they feel , comparing their counterparts ( @xmath27 ) in the reverse process .",
    "however , thanks to spin - dependent controlling techniques , which can be achieved by adjusting parameters of incident light beams , one can regulate tunneling amplitudes of different species , making atoms in different sites feel a similar hopping matrix element , @xmath204 .",
    "this is the reason we straightforwardly set an identical hopping term @xmath0 at the beginning .",
    "meanwhile , to achieve an effective af superexchange interaction , we need to set @xmath205 ( @xmath206 ) to change signs of coefficients : @xmath207 , @xmath208 in equation ( heff1 ) . as a result ,",
    "the global coefficient of spin interaction becomes positive , @xmath209 , as equation ( [ bosonic tj ] ) asks .    under these circumstances ,",
    "we finally derive the bosonic @xmath0-@xmath1 model with a small inhomogeneity in @xmath210 direction , which can be formally written as equation ( [ bosonic tj ] ) .",
    "quite recently , two papers @xcite suggested a similar proposal and made detailed discussions .",
    "this representation is equivalent to the following operator identity between the spin and boson operators . defining @xmath211 and @xmath212 , where @xmath213 creates a fermionic holon , leaving a non - local phase string and @xmath45 annihilates a bosonic ( schwinger - boson ) spinon at site @xmath9 , we rewrite equation ( bosonic tj ) as @xmath214 : @xmath215here @xmath216 is a topological phase with the contribution from spinon number @xmath217 , @xmath218 \\hat{n}_{l\\sigma } ^{b}$ ] and the holon s ( @xmath219 ) contribution , @xmath220 \\hat{n}^{h}.$ ] and @xmath221 and @xmath222 describe quantized fluxes bounded to spinons and holons .",

    "<S> some pioneering works@xcite revealed the promising potential of applying ultracold atoms to make quantum computer and quantum simulator : by changing the intensity , phase and polarization of incident laser beams , one can tune the hamiltonian parameters including the dimension , the hopping strength and the particle interaction at will . </S>",
    "<S> people have successfully observed the mott insulator  superfluid transition in both bosonic@xcite and fermionic@xcite degenerate gases , and have demonstrated how to produce@xcite and control effective spin interactions in a double - well ensemble@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all these evidences imply that an era in which atomic and optical physics unites with condensed - matter physics is within sight .    </S>",
    "<S> particularly , the two - dimensional fermionic hubbard model ( or @xmath0-@xmath1 model ) is one of the most interesting issues depicting the nature of high - temperature superconductivity@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ever since the discovery of high @xmath2 cuprates , tremendous efforts had been contributed to investigations of this model . derived from hubbard model at half - filling ( one electron per site ) </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath0-@xmath1 model describes the motion of doped holes in an antiferromagnetic ( af ) background . </S>",
    "<S> it carries the essence of a strongly correlated electronic system with intrinsic competition between superexchange interaction of spins and hopping processes of charge - carriers ( holes ) . over the past two decades , people have employed many methods and developed different schemes , hoping to fully understand this model . </S>",
    "<S> although a lot of consensus have been accomplished , there are still some ambiguities to be clarified . for example </S>",
    "<S> , can superconductivity evolve from a purely fermionic repulsive many - body system ? are there exist some new phases of matter in high-@xmath2 superconductors ?    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , some people suggest to use its bosonic counterpart , the bosonic @xmath3-@xmath1 model@xcite , as a trial model to investigate , for bosons are much more easier to deal with in both analytic and numerical approaches . after obtaining some experiences and conclusions , </S>",
    "<S> we may use them as  reminders and analogies to original fermionic model . besides </S>",
    "<S> , considering the present situation of experiments in ultracold atoms , where bosons are more accessible to be cooled and controlled , we believe it is worthwhile to explore the bosonic @xmath0-@xmath1 model in optical lattices which can be formally written into two parts : @xmath4where hilbert space is restricted by the no - double - occupancy constraint @xmath5 , @xmath6 annihilates a two - component boson ( @xmath7 denoting two internal states ) and @xmath8 is the ( pseudo)spin operator at site @xmath9 , @xmath10 with pauli matrix @xmath11 , @xmath12 denotes the nearest - neighboring counting . @xmath13 and @xmath14 describes hopping ( @xmath15 ) and an effective af superexchange ( @xmath16 ) interactions respectively .    in a seminal experiment@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> bloch _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ loaded a two - component @xmath17rb condensate , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , into arrays of isolated double wells . by changing the relative phase of the two laser standing  waves , the potential difference @xmath20 in one double - well can be raised or ramped down . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillation of the condensate after such manipulation contained information of the strength and sign of the effective superexchange energy @xmath1 . with proper bias @xmath20 </S>",
    "<S> , they could convert ferromagnetic interaction ( @xmath21 ) into antiferromagnetic one ( @xmath16 ) .     </S>",
    "<S> and @xmath22 ) with a relative phase difference @xmath23 to produce a superlattice . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath24 is the depth of the potential well . </S>",
    "<S> the superexchange processes are realized through virtual hoppings , resulting perturbations @xmath25 in the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) a visualization of a 2d superlattice , blue atoms denote one spin species ( @xmath26 ) and red atoms denote the other species ( @xmath27).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]   and @xmath22 ) with a relative phase difference @xmath23 to produce a superlattice . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath24 is the depth of the potential well . </S>",
    "<S> the superexchange processes are realized through virtual hoppings , resulting perturbations @xmath25 in the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) a visualization of a 2d superlattice , blue atoms denote one spin species ( @xmath26 ) and red atoms denote the other species ( @xmath27).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    to implement a controllable hopping term , we have to generalize the double - wells to a set of biased optical superlattices . as illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ superlattice ] ) , for instance , we can start from the situation with one boson per site , different species in neighboring sites . </S>",
    "<S> then by adding another set of optical lattice adiabatically , whose wavelength is as twice as the original one and has a relative phase difference of @xmath28 , we can build a superlattice ( with shallow sites and deep sites ) , where a certain type of bosons being trapped in a certain type of sites , for instance , @xmath29 in shallow sites and @xmath30 in its neighboring deep sites .    by changing the shape of the superlattice , one can lift the potential difference @xmath20 to a fixed value to realize the effective af superexchange interaction ( @xmath16 ) . furthermore , by adjusting the relative phase and polarization between incident lasers , one can control the tunneling amplitude @xmath31 of different inner states of atoms in different sites to be identical . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we can introduce the hopping effect while keeping a(n ) ( inhomogeneous ) heisenberg - type interaction in an optical superlattice . </S>",
    "<S> ( see methods for details . )    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , according to ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , one can introduce vacancies in a bec trapped in one - dimensional ( 1d ) optical lattice by pointing an electron beam at specific sites to remove atoms . </S>",
    "<S> due to the small diameter ( @xmath32 nm ) of the electron beam compared with the lattice spacing , holes can be doped in without additional losses in other sites . </S>",
    "<S> the final occupying configuration can be visualized with highly spatial resolution through scanning electron microscopy . since </S>",
    "<S> single - occupancy has been achieved in current experiments@xcite as an initial setup , we believe that this technique can be further extended to 2d and 3d superlattices loaded with multi - component atoms , thus one can manipulate and(or ) remove different species deliberately and observe the dynamics of holes with single - atom , single - site sensitivity . above all , the realization of theoretical model ( [ bosonic tj ] ) as well as the necessary doping technique are all within reach in current experiments .    the main analysis is arranged as follows : for bosonic @xmath0-@xmath1 hamiltonian near unit - filling , we analyze the doping effect in a topological perspective . </S>",
    "<S> we show the existence of several exotic phases as vacancies being gradually introduced . </S>",
    "<S> then we discuss how to detect these features in currently - available techniques in ultracold atom experiments . </S>"
