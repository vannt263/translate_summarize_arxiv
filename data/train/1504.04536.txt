    "<S> the observed superconducting dome as function of doping suggests the possibility of unconventional pairing . </S>",
    "<S> as mo is a transition metal and the electronic bands near the fermi level in mos@xmath0 have predominant @xmath2-orbital weight , electron - electron interactions are likely to play a role .    </S>",
    "<S> monolayer mos@xmath0 in the 2h - structure can be regarded as a sibling of of graphene . </S>",
    "<S> compared to graphene with its two c sublattices , in mos@xmath0 , one sublattice site is occupied by mo , while the other sublattice is formed by two s atoms displaced above and below the mo plane . </S>",

    "<S> the possible nature of superconductivity in mos@xmath0 is of high interest to theory@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the work by roldan et al.@xcite compares pairing due to electron - electron interactions and mediated by phonons using effective intra- and inter - pocket interactions between the pockets that form in the conductions band around the @xmath4 and @xmath5 points upon doping . </S>",
    "<S> their conclusion is that phonon - mediated interactions have a smaller effect , and that the resulting pairing is driven by the short - ranged coulomb interactions , and comes out as odd parity . </S>",

    "<S> the natural question arises if the phenomenology is similar . </S>",
    "<S> we we argue that the multi - orbital nature due to the mixing of 3 @xmath2-orbitals at the fermi level in the conduction band causes qualitative differences , at least for model parameters close to the ab - initio predictions . </S>",
    "<S> we in fact show that the hund s coupling is a tuning parameter that takes us from the doped - graphene scenario to mos@xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> we use the temperature - flow frg@xcite to analyze the possible instabilities due to interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the main idea of the method is that at very high temperatures @xmath8 the interactions of the model are given by the bare ones , as all loop corrections are killed by @xmath8 . upon lowering @xmath8 </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath8-flow tracks the build - up of the loop corrections . </S>",
    "<S> the main object of study is an interaction function @xmath24 that depends in our case on three wavevectors @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 for two incoming legs 1 and 2 and one outgoing leg 3 ( with the same spin projection as leg 1 ) in the conduction band . </S>",
    "<S> the flow equations for @xmath28 for charge and spin - rotational invariance are taken from the general frg formalism for one - particle irreducible vertex functions ( for a review , see refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite or also ref . ) and are given in the supplementary material . </S>",
    "<S> we start the flow at an initial @xmath8 of roughly twenty times the bandwidth . lowering @xmath8 generally leads to a strong differentiation of the components of @xmath28 , where certain components become large at low @xmath8 and </S>",
    "<S> actually diverge . </S>",
    "<S> these generalized cooper instabilities can then be interpreted as ordering tendency in a particular channel , depending on which combination of @xmath29 , @xmath30 etc . </S>",
    "<S> actually grows most strongly . </S>",
    "<S> the flow is stopped when the maximal component of @xmath31 grows larger than thirty times larger than the bandwidth . </S>",
    "<S> this defines a critical temperature @xmath32 which should be understood as upper estimate for any true ordering . </S>",
    "<S> more information about the interpretation of the frg flow can e.g. be found in the reviews of refs . @xcite and @xcite . in a true two - dimensional system , </S>",
    "<S> collective effects should in fact destroy any long range order that breaks continuous symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> these effects are however not included in the used approximation in the frg , so do not play a role in our results . also in view of the embedding of the experimental systems in three dimensions </S>",
    "<S> we do not expect that such collective effects have to be considered at this stage . </S>",
    "<S> further , we patch brillouin zone around the @xmath4 , @xmath5 points with patch center points numbered by @xmath33 , as seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> then we discretize the coupling function as @xmath34 , i.e. with @xmath35 components . at each corner </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 , @xmath5 , we take 5 patches ( schemes with more patches have also been checked , the result is stable ) . </S>",
    "<S> we divide the radial direction of each patch into three sectors , providing some more resolution in the radial direction . in the loop calculations , we use 3 radial integration lines in each patch , but did also checks with more lines .     </S>",
    "<S> the fermi surface ( fs ) is around the @xmath4 , @xmath5 points . on the fs </S>",
    "<S> we define 30 patch points ( grey filled circles ) . </S>",
    "<S> the patch index @xmath36 runs from @xmath37 to @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to these fs points , we define two other sets of patch points ( blue and pinks circles ) . </S>",
    "<S> this way , the energy dispersion is monotonic in each sector in radial direction . </S>",
    "<S> right : pair scattering at small @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the green symbols in the main plot show the frg data for the low - t pair scattering @xmath39 near the instability , where the two incoming wavevectors belonging to index @xmath36 and @xmath40 add up to total zero momentum . </S>",

    "<S> inset : @xmath42 as function of patch indices @xmath43 and @xmath44 for @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> clearly visible is that only interactions with a special relation between @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( implying zero total incoming wavevector ) become large . for the data in this plot , @xmath46ev . </S>",
    "<S> , width=325 ]    we run the @xmath8-flow frg for a wider range of electron dopings @xmath17 . for small @xmath17 , we find pairing instabilities with total - momentum - zero cooper pairs in the odd - parity channel , while at larger @xmath17 near van hove filling , a ferromagnetic ( fm ) instability is found . </S>",
    "<S> the latter can be understood as a renormalized version of a stoner instability due to a large dos at the fermi level .    </S>",
    "<S> the data for a prototypical pairing instability at @xmath47 is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] on the right side . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows the coupling function for incoming and outgoing legs at the fermi surface , as function of the two incoming patch indices , with the first outgoing leg fixed in patch 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the two diagonal features are exactly on the lines where the two incoming wavevectors add up to zero . </S>",
    "<S> these pair - scattering processes grow to very large absolute values and cause the instability . </S>",
    "<S> we also see the sign structure with pieces of large positive and large negative values . </S>",
    "<S> this is detailed more in the main part of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , right side , which is basically a cut along the zero - total - momentum diagonal features in the inset . by looking up </S>",
    "<S> the patch numbers fig . 1 one extracts that the pairing changes sign upon rotating the incoming pair by 60 degrees , from one fermi pocket around , e.g. around @xmath4 , to another pocket , e.g. around @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the same sign change is found when the incoming pair is fixed and the outgoing pair is varied . </S>",
    "<S> the couplings do not vary much around @xmath15 points , i.e. is no nodal structure along the fermi pockets . </S>",
    "<S> this odd - parity pairing can be identified to transform according to the one - dimensional @xmath48 irreducible representation of @xmath49 point group of mos@xmath0 . in real space </S>",
    "<S> it can be understood as having its main contributions on the bonds from one mo site to its 6 nearest neighbor mo sites , with the sign alternating upon 60 degrees rotation , implying the odd parity . </S>",
    "<S> the form factor in wave vector space can also be interpreted as @xmath1-wave and reads @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> the fit to this form factor shows good agreement ( red squares and green circles in fig.3 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we also run a momentum - cutoff frg flow@xcite which disfavors fm fluctuations with small wave - vector transfer across the fermi surface down to very low scales@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these flows do not give any instabilities but show some tendency to even - parity pairing . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we can conclude that @xmath1-wave pairing is driven by @xmath51 ferromagnetic fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> a similar conclusion is reached by turning off specific channel spin fluctuation channels in the flow equation directly .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] we show the frg phase diagram of our mos@xmath0 model with doping . in the low doping regime , the discussed @xmath1-wave superconductivity is the dominant instability , with a relatively low critical temperature @xmath32 ( of order @xmath52mev ) . </S>",
    "<S> we can also see that the critical temperature grows with increasing electron doping . </S>",
    "<S> the highest scale for pairing for our parameters is around @xmath53mev , considerably higher than the experimental data around @xmath54mev . </S>",
    "<S> we comment on this further below . </S>",
    "<S> the optimal doping for the @xmath1-wave pairing is reached around @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> this shows good agreement with experiment@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the increasing dos with growing @xmath17 also enhances the fm fluctuations . in simple mean - field or stoner pictures the critical interaction strength required for fm order is inversely proportional to the dos at the fermi level , and as the dos diverges at the van hove filling , one will definitely find ordering in these approaches . in the frg calculations we also obtain a regime where the leading instability is of fm type , however in reduced extent compared to mean - field theory due to the competition with other fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the prediction form the frg approach would be that there are predominant fm fluctuations around the van hove filling . whether the ordering actually occurs or not can not be answered by our calculations . for the hubbard model on the square lattice at large second - nearest - neighbor hopping </S>",
    "<S> , the frg also predicts fm ordering , in agreement with variational montecarlo results@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the van hove filling may be hard to realize precisely in the experiment as disorder and spatial fluctuations will tend to smear out the diverging dos . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the fm correlations should still be visibly enhanced .     versus electron doping @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the blue dots give the @xmath32s according to frg for the @xmath1-wave superconducting phase ( * sc * ) . </S>",
    "<S> the purple dots represent the @xmath32s ferromagnetic state ( * fm * ) , now scaled down by a factor of 100 . </S>",
    "<S> the frg @xmath32s should be interpreted as upper bounds for true ordering temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> right : frg critical temperatures as function of hund s coupling @xmath56 for both the triplet pairing ( blue circles , ) and fm instability ( pink circles , again multiplied by 0.01 ) . </S>",
    "<S> notably , for @xmath57 the dominant pairing instability appears in the @xmath2-wave singlet pairing channel . </S>",
    "<S> , width=302 ]    at small @xmath17 the states near the fermi level are mainly of @xmath18-type . </S>",
    "<S> thus the local intraorbital repulsion , @xmath58 , should be important . </S>",
    "<S> we hence run the flow with only @xmath58 being nonzero . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , the flow still ends up with the @xmath1-wave instability . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath32 is lowered from about 4.8mev with full interactions down to @xmath59mev . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that interorbital processes contribute significantly to the pairing . </S>",
    "<S> next we vary the hund s coupling @xmath56 in the interactions as given in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) , with @xmath58 and @xmath60 fixed , and the doping fixed at @xmath61ev . from fig .  4 </S>",
    "<S> , we can read off an enhancement of @xmath32 in the @xmath1-wave regime by a larger @xmath56 , from @xmath62mev to around @xmath53mev . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath56 enhances the @xmath1-wave instability as well . </S>",
    "<S> even more strikingly , when we set the @xmath63ev , the system gives way to an even - parity pairing structure , with most attractive eigenvalues in the @xmath2-wave symmetry channel@xcite , associated with the two - dimensional @xmath64 irreducible representation of @xmath49 point group . </S>",
    "<S> complex combinations of @xmath12 and @xmath11 break time - reversal symmetry , leading to chiral edge modes as known from strongly doped graphene models@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the importance of the hund s coupling @xmath56 in the fm regime . </S>",
    "<S> the data is shown as pink dots in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 5 . </S>",
    "<S> the critical temperature is again enhanced dramatically when @xmath56 is increased . </S>",
    "<S> the hund s coupling intensifies the fm fluctuations just as it strengthens the @xmath1-wave pairing . </S>",
    "<S> such an effect of @xmath56 also reported in models for naco@xmath65o@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also observe a kink in the critical temperature as a function of @xmath56 at @xmath66ev where the system undergoes a phase transition from even - parity pairing at small @xmath56 to odd - parity pairing . </S>",
    "<S> hence @xmath56 has a key role as a switch between two different situations . on the one hand </S>",
    "<S> , we have the single - orbital scenario of graphene , where @xmath56 is ineffective as the bands near the fermi level are just made from c @xmath67-states . </S>",
    "<S> then one finds strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations and chiral @xmath2-wave singlet pairing . for mos@xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> the multi - orbital character of the conduction band makes @xmath56 important and , for realistic values of @xmath56 according to crpa , one finds predominant fm fluctuations and triplet pairing .    </S>",
    "<S> these considerations indicate that the superconducting ground state is quite susceptible to parameter changes . </S>",
    "<S> this is one reason why the rather large pairing scales @xmath68mev exceeding the experimental scales by one order of magnitude should not be taken as a failure of this theoretical picture . </S>",
    "<S> some reduction of the @xmath32s should be expected if we would be able to include self - energy corrections or more collective fluctuations into the frg , which is however not yet technically feasible for multiband systems . in view of the importance of the hund s rule coupling </S>",
    "<S> , we refer to recent works by georges et al.@xcite , who pointed out that @xmath56 typically degrades the quasiparticle weight resulting in a bad _ hund s metal_. this may be another important factor that reduces the superconducting @xmath32s compared to our study . </S>",
    "<S> then there are uncertainties about the actual experimental system . </S>",
    "<S> disorder is expected to have an effect on the @xmath32 of any unconventional superconductor , although in the @xmath1-wave case only large - momentum impurity scattering will have an impact of the phase structure of the pairing . on the positive side , the high scales from the theory </S>",
    "<S> might actually show that there may be some headroom for reaching higher @xmath32s in mo@xmath69 and related systems .    in mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> the spin - orbit coupling splitting can reach the order @xmath70ev @xcite . in the conduction band near @xmath4 , @xmath5 , the actual values may be smaller @xmath71mev@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath72-component is conserved around the small fermi pockets shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 which then split into two pockets around each @xmath4 , @xmath5 . by time - reversal symmetry , the pockets with the same radius at different pockets will have opposite spin projections . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1-wave pairing does not violate time - reversal symmetry@xcite and should not be changed strongly by the small splitting near @xmath4 , @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> in such a case , the @xmath73 component of the gap function @xmath74 can be expected to be dominant . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to @xmath75 pairing .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the possible pairing structure in monolayer - mos@xmath0 by the unbiased @xmath8-flow frg . for interaction parameters obtained by crpa , </S>",
    "<S> the leading instability at low electron doping lies in the @xmath1-wave pairing channel . </S>",
    "<S> we argued that ferromagnetic fluctuations provide the pairing glue . </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagram exhibits dominant @xmath1-wave pairing up to @xmath76 . for doping close to the van - hove filling </S>",
    "<S> , sufficiently strong interactions result in fm order . </S>",
    "<S> the pairing @xmath32 is maximal around an optimal doping of @xmath77 , in quite a good agreement with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> varying the hund coupling strength @xmath56 showed strong effects on both the @xmath1-wave pairing scale and the fm tendencies . </S>",
    "<S> notably , when @xmath56 is relatively small or set to zero , the leading pairing instability is in the singlet @xmath2-wave channel . </S>",
    "<S> this emphasizes the importance of the hund s coupling and the multi - orbital nature of the mo-@xmath2-dominated conduction band .    </S>",
    "<S> our study extends earlier work by roldan et al.@xcite who already found @xmath1-wave pairing . </S>",
    "<S> it clarifies the nature of the pairing mechanism , the influence of the model parameters , the importance of fm fluctuations and the hund s coupling . </S>",
    "<S> future studies should include the phonon - mediated electronic interactions . </S>",
    "<S> this should allow one to compare the relative importances of these two distinct pictures for the superconductivity in mos@xmath0 .    </S>",
