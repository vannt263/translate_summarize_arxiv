    "the action functionals of the various models of quantum field theory yield many examples of beautiful variational problems .",
    "these problems are usually analytically very difficult , because they represent borderline cases , due to phenomena like conformal invariance .",
    "what makes them still tractable usually is their intricate algebraic structure resulting from the various symmetries of and the interactions between the various fields involved .",
    "mathematically , often a geometric interpretation of these algebraic structures is possible . in any case",
    ", the analysis needs to use the special structure of the action functional .",
    "a well known instance is the theory of harmonic mappings from riemann surfaces to riemannian manifolds , which in the context of qft arise from the action functional of the nonlinear sigma model , or the polyakov action of string theory . here , a particular skew symmetry of the nonlinear term in the euler ",
    "lagrange equations could be systematically exploited and generalized in the work of hlein , rivire and struwe , see @xcite .",
    "this is also our starting point , both conceptually  because we generalize the harmonic map problem  and methodologically  because we shall use their techniques .",
    "in fact , the action functional of the nonlinear sigma model and the polyakov action of string theory constitute only the simplest of their kind . in more sophisticated models ,",
    "other fields enter , in particular a spinor field .",
    "also , when one investigates the harmonic action functional mathematically , naturally also another object enters , the metric @xmath3 or the conformal structure of the underlying riemann surface , and for many purposes , not only the field , but also @xmath3 should be varied . again",
    ", however , in the advanced qft models , there arises another object , a kind of partner of the metric @xmath3 , the gravitino @xmath4 , also called the rarita - schwinger field . in harmonic map theory , or in related theories , like teichmller theory  la ahlfors - bers , one often needs to consider metrics @xmath3 that are not necessarily smooth , and this may lead to delicate regularity questions . likewise ,",
    "the gravitino is not necessarily smooth , and in this paper we address the related regularity questions .",
    "in fact , this article is a part of our systematic study of an action functional motivated from super string theory .",
    "let us now describe its ingredients in more precise terms .",
    "they are a map from an oriented riemann surface to a compact riemannian manifold and its super partner , a vector spinor , with the riemannian metric of the domain and its super partner , the gravitino , as parameters .",
    "this action functional is the two - dimensional nonlinear sigma model of quantum field theory , which has been studied for a long time both in physics and mathematics .",
    "such models have been used in supersymmetric string theory since the 1970s , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more details about the mathematical aspects .    in a recent work @xcite ,",
    "a corresponding geometric model was set up and some analytical issues were studied .",
    "in contrast with the previous models which use anticommuting fields and which are therefore not directly amenable to the methods of geometric analysis , this model uses only commuting fields and thus is given within the context of riemannian geometry .",
    "though this approach makes the supersymmetries involved less transparent , it has the advantages that this model is closely related to mathematically long - studied models such as harmonic maps and dirac - harmonic maps and their various variants . on this basis",
    ", the regularity issues can now be investigated .",
    "the smoothness of weak solutions of the euler ",
    "lagrange equations , with smooth riemannian metric and gravitino , was obtained in @xcite .",
    "the analysis of two - dimensional harmonic maps , and even more so , of dirac - harmonic maps is quite subtle , because they constitute borderline cases for the regularity theory , with phenomena like bubbling .",
    "while the harmonic map case by now can be considered as well understood , and much is known about dirac - harmonic maps , it turns out that major new difficulties from the analytical perspective are caused by the gravitino , even if the gravitino is treated only as a parameter and not as a dependent variable in its own right .",
    "these difficulties arise from the way the gravitino is coupled with the spinor field in the action functional , see below .",
    "these difficulties become even more severe if the gravitino in the model is not smooth .",
    "more precisely , we encounter the following question : _ what is the weakest possible assumption on the gravitino and under such an assumption how smooth will the critical points of the action functional be ?",
    "_ apparently in general we can no longer expect @xmath5 differentiability , but one may still hope to improve the original regularity of the weak solutions . here",
    "we explore this issue .",
    "we shall combine the regularity theory of @xcite with morrey space theory and a subtle iteration argument to achieve what should be the optimal regularity results in our setting .",
    "let us briefly recall the framework of the model in @xcite . for details",
    "we refer to that article and the references therein .",
    "let @xmath6 be a closed riemannian surface with a fixed spin structure and @xmath7 an @xmath8-dimensional closed riemannian manifold .",
    "let @xmath9 be a spinor bundle over @xmath10 associated to the given spin structure , which has real rank four .",
    "this spinor bundle is a dirac bundle in the sense of @xcite . in particular",
    ", there is a canonical spin connection and spin metric which is a fiberwise real inner product .",
    "the clifford multiplication by a tangent vector will be denoted by a dot when no confusion can arise .",
    "a gravitino is by definition a section @xmath4 of the vector bundle @xmath11 .",
    "the clifford multiplication gives rise to a map  @xmath12 , which is given by multiplying the tangent vectors to the spinors .",
    "this map is linear and surjective , and moreover the following short exact sequence splits : @xmath13 the projection map to the kernel is denoted by @xmath14 . in a local oriented orthonormal frame @xmath15 of @xmath10 , using the summation convention as always , this projection is given by @xmath16    now let @xmath17 be a map between riemannian manifolds .",
    "one can consider the twisted spinor bundle @xmath18 .",
    "it is again a riemannian vector bundle over @xmath10 and on it a twisted spin dirac operator @xmath19 is defined , which is essentially self - adjoint with respect to the inner product in @xmath20 .",
    "then the action functional is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the pullback of the curvature of @xmath23 under @xmath24 , and the curvature term in the action is defined , in a local coordinate @xmath25 of @xmath23 and with @xmath26 , by @xmath27 one can easily check that this is independent of the choices of local orthonormal frames . note that this action functional can actually be defined on the space @xmath28 here by @xmath29 we mean the space of @xmath30 sections of the twisted spinor bundle @xmath18 .",
    "it is then clear that an @xmath31 assumption on @xmath4 is sufficient to make the action functional well defined and finite valued .",
    "we remark that the lagrangian of the action appears in this form for reasons of supersymmetry .",
    "note that in the particular case where the gravitino vanishes , this reduces to the dirac - harmonic map functional with curvature term introduced in @xcite and further studied in e.g. @xcite .",
    "if in addition , the curvature terms in the lagrangian also vanish , this reduces to the dirac - harmonic map functional introduced in @xcite , which is studied to a great extent in e.g. @xcite .    taking a local oriented orthonormal frame @xmath32 , the euler ",
    "lagrange equations are @xmath33 where we have used the following abbreviations : @xmath34    to deal with the regularity it is advantageous to embed @xmath7 isometrically into some euclidean space , say @xmath35 , and transfer the various quantities on @xmath23 to their images / pushforwards of @xmath35 .",
    "let @xmath36 be such a smooth isometric embedding with second fundamental form  @xmath37 , and let @xmath38 be the composed map and @xmath39 the pushforward vector spinor .",
    "it suffices to consider the regularity of @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath41 be the global coordinates of @xmath35 and let @xmath42 be a local normal frame of the submanifold @xmath43 .",
    "then @xmath44 can be viewed as a @xmath35-valued function , and @xmath45 , where each @xmath46 is a spinor , satisfies @xmath47 since regularity is a local issue , we may locate the problem on the unit disk @xmath48 .",
    "then the equations satisfied by @xmath40 are @xmath49 and @xmath50 for each @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the euclidean laplacian operator , @xmath53 the euclidean dirac operator , @xmath54 the euclidean gradient operator , the coefficients are written in the following antisymmetric form : @xmath55 while @xmath56 for a detailed clarification of these formulae we refer to @xcite . for the cases of the simpler models , namely dirac - harmonic maps and dirac - harmonic maps with curvature terms ,",

    "unfortunately , if @xmath4 is only assumed to be @xmath31 , it is not yet clear how to achieve this . therefore , we first try to deal with an @xmath0 gravitino with @xmath67 .",

    "we say that a measurable function @xmath69 is an almost @xmath0 function , denoted by @xmath70 , if @xmath71 for any @xmath72 .    for example , for a bounded domain @xmath73 with smooth boundary ( actually a lipschitz boundary is enough ) , the sobolev embedding theorem says @xmath74    then we can state the first result .",

    "the methods used here are quite typical in the analysis of geometric partial differential equations . as we are dealing with a critical case for the sobolev framework , we need a little morrey space theory",
    ". then rivire s regularity theory @xcite and its extensions in e.g. @xcite enable us to utilize the antisymmetric structure of the equations for @xmath24 to improve the regularity .",
    "using similar methods , regularity results for weak solutions of the simpler models , namely dirac - harmonic maps and dirac - harmonic maps with curvature terms , are achieved in @xcite . here in this more general model ,",
    "the structure of the system is even more complicated because of the divergence terms and the appearance of the gravitinos . in the present work",
    ", we obtain regularity results for weak solutions for the case of coarse gravitinos .    with this result in hand , we turn to the system - .",
