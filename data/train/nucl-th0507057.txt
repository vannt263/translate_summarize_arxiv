    "it is quite possible that a new state of matter is created at unprecedented high energy density reached in relativistic heavy - ion collisions at rhic @xcite .",
    "this conclusion is based , in particular , on the success of hydrodynamic models in description of the measured single - particle hadron momentum spectra and elliptic flows @xcite . within the hydrodynamic approach",
    ", there is , in principle , a possibility to extract the equation of state ( eos ) of the thermalized system and then get information about the early stage of the collision processes and even the type of the phase transition between qgp and the hadron matter .",
    "however quantitative determination of the eos in the hydrodynamic approach is a nontrivial problem .",
    "it depends on both the initial conditions and system `` freeze - out '' prescription .",
    "the latter determines the final conditions of hydrodynamic expansion : one can not use hydrodynamic equations for infinitely large times since the resulting very small densities destroy the picture of continuous medium of real particles .",
    "usually , the freeze - out hypersurface which confines the 4-volume of hydrodynamic evolution is included as an external input with respect to hydrodynamic equations .",
    "then , typically , particle spectra are described by the cooper - frye prescription ( cfp ) @xcite which treats freeze - out as a sudden transition from local thermal equilibrium to free streaming that happens on some space - like 3d hypersurface , e.g. , on a space - like part of the isotherm : @xmath5 @xcite . in reality",
    "the process of freeze - out , or particle liberation , is quite complicated because the particles escape from the system during the whole period of its evolution ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a method which is based on boltzmann equation was recently proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe the spectra formation in the hydrodynamic approach to a+a collisions using the escape probabilities .",
    "the region of applicability of cfp and its possible generalizations are discussed there , as well as in ref .",
    "@xcite . in present work",
    "we do not consider the whole complexity of the freeze - out process ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "instead we account for continuous ( in time ) emission process by applying the generalized cooper - frye prescription for an _ enclosed _ freeze - out hypersurface .",
    "such an enclosed hypersurface contains space - like sectors of the volume emission and non - space - like ones ( with space - like normal ) of the surface emission .",
    "it is well known @xcite that protracted surface emission may lead to the ratio of the outward to sideward interferometry radii , @xmath6 , much bigger than unity for typical scenarios of phase transition in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "these expectations are , however , in contradiction with current experimental data from rhic where @xmath7 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this discrepancy is a component of the so - called `` hbt puzzle '' @xcite .",
    "naively , from this one might conclude that the duration of emission is very short .",
    "however , the @xmath6 ratio is also quite sensitive to the shape of freeze - out hypersurface because , unlike @xmath8 , @xmath9 is a mixture of the _ out- _ width , time spread of emission , and the @xmath1 correlations .",
    "indeed , in the gaussian approximation for the correlation function the interferometry radii can be expressed in terms of the space - time variances only , and , therefore , could be used solely for qualitative estimates . ]",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 = @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) are the cartesian components of the vectors @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , respectively , and @xmath21 is the mean 4-momentum of the two registered particles . here",
    "@xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 denotes the averaged ( over the distribution function ) value taken at some momentum @xmath25 .",
    "note that in the bertsch - pratt reference frame @xcite @xmath26 and therefore @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the absolute value of the transverse component of the vector @xmath19 .",
    "it is easy to see from eq .",
    "( [ variance ] ) that _ positive _ @xmath1 correlations , @xmath29 , give a _ negative _ contribution to @xmath9 reducing thereby the @xmath6 ratio .",
    "ratio is realized in a multiphase transport ( ampt ) model @xcite . ]",
    "therefore one can conclude that relatively small @xmath7 ratio in a case of a prolonged surface emission can take place if there are positive @xmath1 correlations in the corresponding sector of the freeze - out hypersurface .",
    "such a sector has typically a space - like 4-normal .",
    "then an interval between space - time points in such a sector can be , generally , space - like as well as time - like . while the bulk of hadrons are emitted from the sector with a time - like normal ( volume emission ) , the surface emission from the sector with a space - like normal can be , nevertheless , important for spectra and hbt radii formation , especially at relatively high @xmath28 . a difference in temperature values and intensities of collective flows particles",
    "freeze out early from the surface , while low-@xmath28 ones decouple later from the system s center . ] in different freeze - out sectors can increase the effect , and thus a consistent description of the single - particle spectra and interferometry radii can be reached in hydrodynamically - motivated models with an enclosed freeze - out hypersurface that accounts for continuous ( in time ) character of particle emission .",
    "it is well known that when the freeze - out hypersurface @xmath30 has non - space - like sectors , the cfp is inconsistent .",
    "then the cfp should be modified to exclude formally negative contributions to the particle number at the corresponding momenta .",
    "the simplest prescription is to present the distribution function as a product of a local thermal distribution and the step function like @xmath31 @xcite , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is a time - like or space - like outward normal to a freeze - out hypersurface @xmath34 .",
    "thereby freeze - out is restricted to those particles for which @xmath35 is positive .    sometimes , to avoid the above mentioned problems with cfp",
    ", the continuity of particles emission in heavy ion collisions is taken into account by means of the emission ( source ) function @xmath36 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , which is used instead of the distribution ( wigner ) function @xmath37 in some hydro - inspired parameterizations and is usually chosen to be proportional to the local equilibrium distribution function , @xmath38 , with a smearing ( proper ) time factor @xmath39 .",
    "first , such a prescription loses an extremely important information about @xmath40 correlations : it is naturally that at early times the emission function is concentrated mostly at the periphery of the system on the boundary with vacuum , since particles can not escape from the hot and dense central region .",
    "the approximation of surface emission is , thus , much more realistic for the early times .",
    "second , while the distribution function is well defined for a given state of the system , like the local bose - einstein or fermi - dirac distributions are associated with a locally equilibrated state , @xmath36 is much more complicated and model dependent @xcite .",
    "it is demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , starting from a particular exact solution of the boltzmann equation , that the emission function is not proportional to the local equilibrium distribution ( wigner function ) , although the system is in a local equilibrium state .",
    "therefore the widely used ( see , e.g. , so called `` blast - wave '' model @xcite ) `` local equilibrium '' ansatz , @xmath41 , is supported neither by analytic kinetic results nor numerical transport calculations except for the formal case when all the particles are emitted simultaneously : the emission function is then the distribution function multiplied by a delta function concentrated on the freeze - out hypersurface . perhaps , too large values of maximal collective velocities , close to the speed of light , which are necessary to fit the spectra in the blast - wave parametrization , and a failure in fitting hbt radii ( especially @xmath8 , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) are caused by an improper description of the particle emission process .",
    "the aim of this work is a coherent description of pion , kaon and proton single - particle momentum spectra as well as the hbt pion radii in central rhic au+au collisions at @xmath42 gev by means of a simple hydrodynamically - motivated parametrization with an enclosed freeze - out hypersurface . as a matter of fact",
    ", we generalize the blast - wave parametrization for a realistic case of continuous emission over the whole lifetime of the fireball .",
    "we demonstrate that a consistent description of the observables is possible if the freeze - out hypersurface has a non - space - like sector emitting a noticeable part of the particles . reducing thereby @xmath6 ratio . ]",
    "the latter condition is satisfied when particles are emitted from the surface of an expanding hydrodynamic tube soon after the hadronization , which at early times happens at the periphery of the volume occupied by quark - gluon matter .",
    "we assume that particles are emitted from some 3d hypersurface when the fireball is in a locally equilibrated ( leq ) state , @xmath43 characterized by the temperature @xmath44 ( which is common for all the particle species ) , collective velocity field @xmath45 and the chemical potentials @xmath46 depending on the particle species @xmath14 .",
    "we refer to the part of 3d hypersurface with a time - like normal vector as @xmath47- ( volume ) freeze - out , or final breakup , and the rest of the hypersurface with a space - like normal as @xmath48- ( surface ) freeze - out , corresponding to continuous emission prior to the final breakup .",
    "we assume that particle densities are uniform at each @xmath49 and @xmath50 hypersurfaces separately , but , in general , are different from each other .",
    "then the temperature and chemical potential in eq .",
    "( [ f-l.eq . ] ) are replaced with @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , @xmath54 for the @xmath49 and @xmath50 freeze - out sectors , respectively . for the sake of simplicity and reduction of the number of parameters",
    "we do not interpolate smoothly the values of temperature and chemical potential between the _ volume _ and _ surface _ sectors of the hypersurface .",
    "a longitudinally boost - invariant expansion is a rather good approximation in mid - rapidity region at rhic @xcite , therefore we assume boost invariance for longitudinal hydrodynamic velocities in this region , @xmath55 , which allows us to parameterize @xmath56 and @xmath57 at 3d hypersurface @xmath58 as @xmath59 , @xmath60 in both sectors of the freeze - out hypersurface , where @xmath61 is the bjorken proper time @xcite and @xmath62 is the longitudinal fluid rapidity , @xmath63 ; in addition , @xmath64 is the absolute value of transverse coordinate @xmath65 .",
    "taking into account the transverse velocity component @xmath66 in the longitudinally co - moving frame , we obtain for the collective 4-velocity @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the transverse fluid rapidity , @xmath69 .",
    "the particle 4-momentum can be expressed through the momentum rapidity @xmath70 , transverse momentum @xmath71 and transverse mass @xmath72 , @xmath73 then @xmath74    the _ volume _ and _ surface _ elements of the freeze - out hypersurface @xmath75 take the form @xmath76 where @xmath77 and `` + '' and `` - '' correspond to the @xmath49 and @xmath50 sectors of the hypersurface respectively . in the s - sector is , of course , not unique and is used because of its convenience for the chosen type of @xmath75 ( see below ) .",
    "it should be changed if @xmath78 on some part of this hypersurface . ] the surface `` moves '' with a velocity less than the speed of light , @xmath79 , hence @xmath80 . if the 2d surface of the 3d @xmath50 freeze - out sector `` moves '' outwards , @xmath81 , then the product @xmath82 will be negative if the @xmath28 of particles are sufficiently small . in that case",
    "such particles can not really escape from the system .",
    "for particles with fairly high transverse momenta one has @xmath83 , and they will be emitted from the surface of the system into vacuum and stream freely towards detectors . to take this into account we use a modified cooper - frye prescription with the substitution @xcite @xmath84 to get the single particle spectra @xmath85 for diverse particle species and the correlation function of pions @xmath86 : @xmath87 here @xmath88 , @xmath89 . to calculate the correlation function in the region of correlation peak we utilize the smoothness mass shell approximation : @xmath90 where @xmath91 .",
    "we assume that the source of particles in central au + au rhic collisions has cylindrical symmetry and is strongly stretched out in the beam direction ( @xmath92 direction ) : the longitudinal size is much larger than the corresponding length of homogeneity @xcite .",
    "the latter allows us to neglect the finiteness of the system in the longitudinal direction when we calculate particle spectra in the mid - rapidity region around @xmath93 . as for the transverse direction ,",
    "we assume that the source has a finite geometrical size encoded in the limits of integration over @xmath64 : @xmath94 for @xmath49emission and @xmath95 for @xmath50emission , where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the initial and finite effective radii of the system .    to fix a model one needs to define @xmath98 and the transverse rapidity @xmath99 .",
    "we choose the simplest ansatz , aimed at catching the main features of particle emission .",
    "we suppose that the _ volume _ ( space - like ) emission happens as assumed in the blast - wave model at the constant @xmath100 , and the _ surface _ emission takes place during the whole time of hydrodynamic evolution of system : @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the initial time of thermalization . because the fireballs formed in rhic collisions expand in transverse direction with rather high transverse velocity , we can assume that @xmath103 for the _ surface _ freeze - out .",
    "correlation in _",
    "s_- sector of freeze - out hypersurface . ] for the sake of simplicity we parameterize @xmath104 by a linear function , @xmath105 taking into account that @xmath106 and @xmath107 , where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the initial and final transverse radii respectively , @xmath108 , we obtain that @xmath109 please note that the chosen form of @xmath104 is just an approximation that reflects the main properties of the _ surface _ freeze - out .",
    "for example , the chosen constant velocity of outward motion of the transverse surface , @xmath110 , is associated with the mean ( averaged over time ) velocity of the surface , which generally can move with time - dependent velocity .",
    "the form of freeze - out @xmath98 is presented in fig .",
    "it is convenient to parameterize the _ volume _ as well as _ surface _",
    "sectors of the 3d hypersurface by @xmath111 and longitudinal rapidity @xmath62 , therefore the integration in eqs .",
    "( [ sp - def ] ) , ( [ corr - approx ] ) is carried out separately for those sectors : @xmath112\\rightarrow \\int d\\sigma _",
    "{ \\mu } ^{v}[ .. ]_{v}+\\int d\\sigma _ { \\mu } ^{s}[ .. ]_{s}$ ] .    to specify the transverse rapidity @xmath99 , we first connect smoothly the values of transverse rapidity in the _ volume _ and _ surface _ sectors of the hypersurface on their `` border '' .",
    "second , since a linear @xmath64 dependence of the radial velocity profile was found in hydrodynamic simulations @xcite for small transverse collective velocities @xmath113 near the center of the system at fixed @xmath114 , we assume that the transverse flow rapidity profile depends linearly on @xmath64 for _ volume _ freeze - out at @xmath115 , @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the maximal transverse rapidity of the fluid . as for the transverse rapidity profile in the _ surface _ sector of the freeze - out hypersurface , we analyzed various parameterizations .",
    "fits to the data prefer a non - zero initial transverse velocity at @xmath118 fm / c , which is physically reasonable .",
    "indeed , it seems to be natural that the transverse flow velocity at freeze - out surface at any time ( or , at least , on average ) should not be smaller than the average `` velocity '' of the surface , @xmath110 .",
    "such an `` initial '' velocity , @xmath119 fm / c ) , can be developed even at the non - thermal partonic stage before @xmath120 .",
    "also a non - zero initial velocity does not contradict an approximate linearity with radius of rapidity profile at early times , in particular at @xmath102 .",
    "one of the simplest parameterizations which satisfies these properties and allows us to connect smoothly the values of transverse rapidity in the _ volume _ and _ surface _ sectors is the following transverse rapidity distribution : @xmath121 note that @xmath107 and @xmath122 .    in the next section",
    "we apply our model to description of pion , kaon and proton transverse momentum spectra and pion interferometry radii in mid - rapidity in rhic au+au central collisions at @xmath42 gev .",
    "we assume a common enclosed freeze - out hypersurface for all particles species .",
    "then the model contains 7 parameters : @xmath102 , @xmath123 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath117 .",
    "as commonly accepted , we assume that at @xmath124 fm / c the system is already in local thermal equilibrium , and so we will not consider this value as a free parameter .",
    "the values of chemical potentials @xmath125 , @xmath126 which are different for different particle species @xmath127 , are not free parameters and are responsible for the absolute normalization of the spectrum . in details , the situation is somewhat more complicated since resonance decays contribute to both the particle spectra and interferometry radii @xcite . about @xmath128 of pions , kaons and",
    "protons come from those decays after chemical freeze - out happens in high - energy heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the corresponding contribution to pion spectra and interferometry radii was estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite within the hydrodynamic model developed in @xcite .",
    "according to the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , resonance decays do not change significantly the slopes of the transverse pion spectra in the region of interest for kinetic freeze - out temperatures @xmath51 and flows at rhic collisions .",
    "note that the resonance emission from the surface is negligible since heavy resonances have too small heat velocities to escape from the expanding system .",
    "as for the pion interferometry radii , the decays of short - lived resonances result in an augmentation of them as compared with the picture of pure thermal emission , especially in the region of small @xmath28 .",
    "this resonance contribution to the pion interferometry radii decreases with the increase of transverse momenta of the pairs and , as it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite , is smaller than @xmath129 @xmath130 for @xmath131 gev ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "based on these studies , we neglect the changes of slopes of particle transverse spectra due to resonance decays and fit the pion interferometry radii starting from @xmath132 gev where the resonance contributions are fairly small .",
    "finally , to fix @xmath126 , @xmath125 for thermal ( primary ) particles at some @xmath51 and @xmath52 , one needs to know what fraction of measured particles is produced by resonances after thermal ( kinetic ) freeze - out .",
    "such a problem is not fully solved until now and needs further analysis .",
    "since the main aim of this paper is to describe the main features of the physical picture of particle emission in central rhic au+au collisions rather than to fine tune the parameters and perfectly describe the data , we fit the fraction of thermal ( direct ) particles within reasonable limits discussed above ; our final choice is presented in the last column of table 1 .",
    "a preliminary analysis shows that a good fit to spectra and correlations formed on an enclosed hypersurface can not be obtained if the _ surface _",
    "temperature @xmath52 is taken within the standard range for kinetic freeze - out : @xmath133 mev @xmath134 ; it should be taken higher than the pion mass @xmath135 .",
    "it forces us to conclude that the temperature of surface emission is close to the chemical freeze - out temperature , or the hadronization one if chemical freeze - out happens at about the same time , as it is argued in ref .",
    "since the periphery of an expanding system is more dilute , the matter there is in the hadronic phase and hadrons can easily escape from this layer into the surrounding vacuum despite the relatively high temperature ; this was argued in detail in ref .",
    "this natural picture of surface emission at earlier times @xmath136 gives us a possibility to assume @xmath137 for pions and kaons , accounting for chemical equilibrium of pions at chemical freeze - out ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and almost zero net strangeness in central rhic au+au collisions at the top energy .",
    "the results of our fit , which are presented in tables 1 and 2 , demonstrate that the best fit fixes the value of @xmath52 at @xmath138 mev , which is indeed very close to the chemical freeze - out temperature @xmath139 mev obtained in ref .",
    "this justifies our assumption _ a posteriori_. the best fit to proton transverse spectra is achieved at @xmath140 mev , which is slightly more than the value @xmath141 mev found in ref .",
    "@xcite for the baryochemical potential . because chemical potentials determine what part of particles",
    "are emitted from the _ surface _ , and these particles have , of course , different spectrum slopes than the ones emitted from the _ volume _ part of the freeze - out hypersurface .",
    "] concerning the values @xmath126 ,",
    "one readily sees that they are not free parameters of the model , since they should be fixed by the measured respective rapidity densities , @xmath142 .",
    "the best fit to data is obtained for the parameters shown in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "we also present there parameters that were kept constant through the fit procedure . as one can see from figs . @xmath143 and tables 1 , 2 , that good description of pion",
    ", proton and kaon spectra and pion interferometry radii is achieved in the mid - rapidity region of central @xmath42 gev au+au collisions .",
    "the star collaboration data are presented for illustration .",
    "we did not fit these data because they are limited to relatively small @xmath144 values as compared to the phenix data , whereas the surface emission gives a significant contribution in the region of high transverse momenta .",
    "it is noteworthy , that the best fit is achieved when the system already at @xmath124 fm / c expands in the transverse direction with a collective velocity field that reaches at the system border ( at @xmath145 ) the value @xmath146 c. it may indicate that a noticeable contribution into buildup of transverse flow at rhic energies is given at times earlier then 1 fm / c , possibly pre - thermal stages of evolution .",
    "it is interesting to note that hydrodynamic simulations @xcite of heavy ion collisions at rhic energies also indicate the necessity of an initial ( pre - hydrodynamic ) transverse flow to better account for slopes of the observed spectra .",

    "demonstrate the fit according to our model , and the dashed lines indicate the contributions to particle spectra and interferometry radii from _ volume _ freeze - out solely .",
    "the latter corresponds , in fact , to blast - wave model calculations with our _ volume _ freeze - out parameters and @xmath151 .",
    "the experimental data are taken from refs .",
    "we used boltzmann approximation for the distribution functions in the single - particle spectra and interferometry radii calculations for all particle species .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "2 that _ surface _ emission leads to a noticeable enhancement of the single - particle momentum spectra in high @xmath28 region , resulting thereby in an increase of the inverse spectra slope , or effective temperature .",
    "this happens because the particles with relatively low @xmath28 are not emitted from the _ surface _ part of the freeze - out hypersurface that moves outwards and so their contribution to the spectra is suppressed , while the particles with sufficiently high @xmath28 are liberated freely .",
    "this effect is taken into account , as discussed in the previous section , by means of multiplying the distribution functions by the step function , see eq .",
    "( [ theta ] ) , thus restricting the freeze - out to those particles for which the product @xmath82 is positive . note that in the blast - wave parametrization , which takes into account only _ volume _ emission , such a high effective temperature can only be obtained at the cost of a very high transverse flow ( @xmath152 and so @xmath153 c , while in our parametrization @xmath154 , @xmath155 c ) at freeze - out @xcite , which seems less realistic and more difficult to reproduce in hydrodynamic models of the system evolution .",
    "the figures @xmath156 , @xmath157 show our results for the interferometry radii of negative pions .",
    "note that the interferometry radii are measured by the phenix collaboration for @xmath158 @xmath130 centrality events at @xmath42 gev @xcite .",
    "therefore , to adjust the results of the phenix collaboration to the most central @xmath159 @xmath130 centrality bin , we increase the corresponding interferometry radii by a factor calculated in accordance with the @xmath160 dependence of the bertsch - pratt radius parameters found in ref . @xcite . as one can see from fig .",
    "3 , the interplay between ( i ) a long emission time , @xmath161 , which gives an increase of the @xmath9 radius , and ( ii ) positive @xmath162 correlations at the _ surface _ part of the hypersurface where @xmath163 , which reduces the radius , provides a _ moderate _ increase of @xmath9 as compared with the _ volume _ emission at constant @xmath114 .",
    "the @xmath8 radius is almost not affected by the _ surface _ emission . on transport",
    "opacity was also found in a covariant transport model @xcite . ] as to @xmath164 , it is less than in the _ volume _ emission case .",
    "the reason is that @xmath164 is strongly affected by the value of the emission time @xmath114 @xcite and , thereby , is reduced by the emission from early times @xmath165 .",
    "this can explain an apparently low freeze - out value of @xmath114 in relativistic heavy ion collisions if it is extracted assuming instantaneous _ volume _ emission at constant @xmath114 .",
    "figure 4 represents our result for the @xmath6 ratio .",
    "one can see that the _ volume _ blast - wave - like emission ( at a constant @xmath114 ) leads to a rather low @xmath6 ratio .",
    "the `` extra '' reduction of @xmath9 is typical for a sharp freeze - out hypersurface with step density profile in the out - direction , @xmath166 and the maximal velocity on the edge . the same boundary effect of the additional broadening of the correlation function at large momenta in the case of sharp step - like freeze - out in the long - direction",
    "have been found and described in detail in ref . @xcite .",
    "as one can see from fig .",
    "4 , this effect becomes softer for an enclosed freeze - out hypersurface despite the the fact that maximum velocity is also achieved at maximum transverse radius which the system occupies during its evolution .",
    "however , negative @xmath167 correlations can totally destroy the effect of relative reduction of @xmath9 .",
    "that is why the positive @xmath167 correlations in our model are very important to achieve a satisfactory description of the experimental data .",
    "we have studied the effect of continuous particle emission on particle spectra and interferometry radii , based on hydro - inspired parametrization of the enclosed freeze - out hypersurface and distribution functions .",
    "our model generalizes the `` blast - wave '' parametrization , which has difficulties in the fitting of the hbt radii and leads to too large transverse velocities .",
    "we demonstrate that @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath25 single particle spectra and @xmath147 interferometry radii at rhic can be described by a physically reasonable set of parameters when a rather protracted emission ( @xmath168 fm / c ) from the _ surface _ sector of the hypersurface that moves `` outward '' is taken into account .",
    "the phase - space distribution of particles emitted from the surface prior to the fireball breakup is similar to the local chemical equilibrium distribution with parameters rather close to the ones found at chemical freeze - out in rhic au+au collisions .",
    "this could indicate a transformation of quark - gluon matter to hadron gas at the periphery of the system with subsequent hadronic emission just after such a transition from the boundary of the fireball during the whole time of the system s hydro evolution .",
    "thereby , the simple physical arguments requiring the freeze - out hypersurface to be enclosed for finite expanding systems result in a successful description of hadronic spectra and interferometry radii .",
    "this means that particle emission from the early stages of fireball evolution has to be taken into account in advanced hydrodynamic models of a+a collisions .",
    "a quantitative description of a continuous escaping of particles can be made , in particular , within the hydro - kinetic approach to spectra formation proposed in ref .",

    "<S> this protracted surface emission is compensated in outward interferometry radii by positive @xmath1 correlations that are the result of an intensive transverse expansion . </S>",
    "<S> the main features of the experimental data are reproduced : in particular , the obtained ratio of the outward to sideward interferometry radii is less than unity and decreases with increasing transverse momenta of pion pairs . </S>",
    "<S> the extracted value of the temperature of emission from the surface of hydrodynamic tube approximately coincides with one found at chemical freeze - out in rhic au+au collisions . </S>",
    "<S> a significant contribution of the surface emission to the spectra and to the correlation functions at relatively large transverse momenta should be taken into account in advanced hydrodynamic models of ultrarelativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions .    _ </S>",
