    "recently , the discovery of a number of fast radio bursts ( frbs ) was reported @xcite .",
    "typically , they are single radio pulses with flux densities @xmath0 and durations @xmath1 at frequency @xmath2 . no counterparts in other wavelengths",
    "have been detected yet @xcite , maybe due to the lack of rapid , multiwavelength follow - up after the bursts . according to their high dispersion measures ( @xmath3 )",
    ", frbs may originate at cosmological distances @xcite , although the possibility that they happened in the dense regions of local galaxies still can not be excluded yet @xcite .",
    "if frbs are at cosmological distances with redshifts @xmath4 @xcite , the characteristic isotropic radio luminosity ( @xmath5 ) will be @xmath6 and the isotropic energy ( @xmath7 ) released is then @xmath8 . the observable event rate of frbs is suggested to be @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the central engines of frbs are under hot debate .",
    "the durations of frbs indicate the emission regions are compact , while the high brightness of the radio emission requires coherent emission to take effect @xcite , which is similar to radio emissions from pulsar magnetospheres @xcite .",
    "also , the energy reservoir in a neutron star ( ns ) magnetosphere is high enough to account for the energy release of frbs .",
    "these few but significant clues motivate some authors to associate frbs with scenarios involving nss .",
    "several possible models have been proposed , e.g. , magnetar giant flares @xcite , collapse of hypermassive neutron stars ( nss ) into black holes @xcite , binary ns mergers @xcite and planetary companions around nss @xcite . at the same time",
    ", other kinds of models have also been proposed , e.g. , binary white dwarf mergers @xcite , flare stars @xcite and evaporation of primordial black holes @xcite .    however , besides the above scenarios , there may be another external way to trigger the energy release in the ns magnetosphere .",
    "pulsar timing observations have revealed that there may be planets @xcite or asteroid belts @xcite around nss .",
    "recent study shows transient , supergiant pulses from active or dormant pulsars may be triggered by debris entering their magnetospheres @xcite . by migrating into the ns light cylinder before",
    "completely destroyed by evaporation and ionizing , the debris can also disrupt current flows and electromagnetic radiation and therefore account for some intermittency seen in pulsars @xcite . on the other hand , it has previously been suggested in the literature that small solid bodies such as asteroids or comets can impact nss occasionally @xcite . by referring to impact , we mean we are considering small bodies of ballistic trajectories ( with low angular momentum ) , as apposed to orbiting objects with significant angular momentum .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the timescale and energy release of these impacts can meet the requirements of frb progenitors from the first view .",
    "thus we suggest that the impacts between nss and comets / asteroids may provide a possible explanation for frbs .",
    "the structure of our paper is as follows .",
    "we briefly describe the impact process in section 2 . in section 3 ,",
    "we present the formulas for the radiation process and derive the basic features of the emission . in section 4 , the remnant x - ray emission in our scenario is discussed .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section 5 .",
    "in our modeling , the calculations are mainly based on the assumption that frbs are at cosmological distances with redshifts @xmath4 .",
    "the absence of correlation of frbs with any known galaxies or galaxy clusters indicates a lower bound on their distance ( @xmath10 100 mpc , @xcite ) .",
    "note that if frbs happen at such a local distance , our model can still work . in that case , we will only need a smaller asteroid to collide with the ns . a more detailed discussion on this point is given in the last section of our paper .",
    "direct impacts between asteroids / comets and nss have been previously discussed in different contexts . in order to give a quantitative description of our model , here",
    "we would like to give a brief review of the impact process , mainly following the study in @xcite .",
    "when a small solid body of mass @xmath11 falls freely in the gravitational field of an isolated ns of mass @xmath12 , it will undergo elongation in the radial direction .",
    "the elongated body will be broken up at the breakup radius and the collapsed material will be compressed by gravitational radial acceleration and magnetic fields of the ns before landing .",
    "for an fe - ni asteroid with a density @xmath13 , radius @xmath14 , and shear strength @xmath15 , the breakup radius of the elongated body is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the gravitational constant .",
    "we assume the leading fragment ( at @xmath18 ) and lagging portion ( at @xmath19 ) have the same velocity @xmath20 ( @xmath20 is determined from the free fall assumption from @xmath21 ) when the asteroid center is at @xmath22 .",
    "the subsequent free fall gives the evolution of the velocities of the leading and lagging fragments ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) as @xmath25 the difference of arrival time at the surface of the ns ( @xmath26 ) is then @xmath27 where the convention @xmath28 in cgs units is adopted hereafter .",
    "this impact time scale is less than the duration of the observed frbs , so the short - time characteristic of frbs can basically be met in our model .",
    "the descriptions above only consider the gravitational influence of the ns on a potential impacting body .",
    "in realistic case , as the asteroid moves toward the ns , it may be evaporated and ionized by radiation from the compact star and its magnetosphere before impacting the ns @xcite .",
    "note that in our model , the conditions are somewhat special .",
    "first , the asteroids are of low angular momentum and possess ballistic trajectories , as opposed to orbiting objects that are spiraling in .",
    "second , the mass of the asteroid is relatively large ( typically @xmath29 g , see section 3 below ) .",
    "it is much larger than the characteristic mass discussed by @xcite for which the effects of evaporation and ionization are important .",
    "third , the asteroid is assumed to be of fe - ni composition and the shear strength will be larger . as a result , the asteroid might be less prominently affected by factors other than the gravitational influence .",
    "we now present a detailed discussion on this point .    for slowly spinning old pulsars",
    ", ionization does not happen until the asteroid has entered the magnetosphere .",
    "the luminosity of x - rays from the magnetosphere may not be high if the tilt angel of the dipolar magnetic field is small @xcite so that we only need to consider the radiation from the ns surface here .",
    "for an old ns with a surface temperature of @xmath30 , assuming that the asteroid at @xmath31 is in thermal equilibrium with the ns surface radiation , then the temperature of the asteroid is @xmath32 k. when @xmath33 reaches the iron evaporation point ( @xmath34 2000 k ) , the corresponding distance is smaller than typical @xmath35 ( @xmath36 cm ) .",
    "it means the evaporation process could be ignored before the tidal breakup .",
    "we now consider possible electrodynamic effects imposed by the magnetosphere .",
    "after the accreted matter enters the magnetosphere , it will be conducting because of the immense electric field in the frame of the matter .",
    "the magnetic skin depth will be small ( @xmath37 cm ) since the conductivity is large @xcite .",
    "therefore , when the accretion column penetrates between two surfaces of constant longitude , it can be treated as a diamagnetic body with all field lines parallel to its surface . on the other hand ,",
    "if the accretion column crosses some regions with a nonzero field - aligned electric field ( @xmath38 , e.g. , @xcite ) , particle acceleration in these regions can yield @xmath39-ray emission that drives electron / positron pair cascades . with these free charges ,",
    "@xmath40 of these regions may actually turn to be zero since the magnetosphere tends to become force - free . as a result ,",
    "in our model , @xmath40 may not have a strong influence on the trajectory of the main part of the incoming matter at the expense of a little front intruding matter .",
    "thus the result of equation ( 3 ) will not be seriously affected after considering the effects of the ns magnetic field in our framework .",
    "when approaching the ns surface , the accretion column will penetrate the magnetic field as a compressed sheet of diamagnetic fluid with all magnetic field lines parallel to its surface .",
    "the compression in longitude reduces the thickness of the sheet to a few millimeters , while its width in latitude would expand to a few kilometers at the ns surface .",
    "the dense matter then plunges into the ns outer crust and the kinetic energy is converted to thermal energy , launching a rapidly expanding plasmoid fireball along the field lines ( see figure 1 for a schematic illustration ) .",
    "a fan of field lines is finally filled with hot plasma @xcite . in the plasma ,",
    "plenty of electrons are accelerated to ultra - relativistic speeds by magnetic reconnection near the collision site .",
    "radiation from this fan of hot plasma will give birth to an observable frb , as detailed in the following section .",
    "the high brightness temperatures of frbs indicate they are connected with coherent emission .",
    "this radiation mechanism may also be involved in radio emission of pulsars .",
    "although the progenitors of frbs are still uncertain , some constraints on the emission region can be derived from observations @xcite . in our scenario , the hot plasma fan can produce the required coherent emission ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the electron bunches originated from the collision will form a shell with a thickness of @xmath41 at @xmath42 from the ns .",
    "the duration @xmath43 of frbs implies @xmath44 .",
    "the emission volume of this shell is @xmath45 .",
    "note that @xmath46 is the ratio of the shell solid angle to @xmath47 . at the bottom of the fan ,",
    "the thickness in longitude is @xmath48 cm as a result of the turbulent expansion , thus a rough estimate gives @xmath49 .",
    "electrons radiate coherently in patches with a characteristic radial size of @xmath50 ( @xmath51 is the characteristic frequency of curvature emission ) , the corresponding volume of each patch is @xmath52 . here",
    "the factor @xmath53 is the solid angle within which electrons can be casually connected in the relativistic beam .",
    "the coherent curvature emission luminosity can be estimated as @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the emission power of a single electron , @xmath56 is the number of electrons in each coherent patch , and @xmath57 is the number of the patches .",
    "the characteristic frequency of curvature emission is @xmath58    on the other hand , the coherent radiation mechanism may be effective only within a certain distance @xmath59 from the pulsar , since the filamentary instability would grow beyond @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "above @xmath59 , the transverse pressure of plasma begins to exceed the magnetic energy density and the coherent emission vanishes @xcite .",
    "as @xmath42 may be slightly less than @xmath59 , we introduce a parameter @xmath60 to describe the deviation from the balance between the plasma pressure and the magnetic energy density , i.e. @xmath61 . here the magnetic field strength can be estimated as @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the surface magnetic field strength at @xmath64 .    using the formulas above and assuming @xmath65 , @xmath66 , we can solve out the typical lorentz factor of electrons in the emitting shell as @xmath67 the corresponding typical values of other quantities are @xmath68 cm , @xmath69 cm , @xmath70 g , and @xmath71 @xmath72 .",
    "it is worthy to note that @xmath73 actually refers to the number density of electrons and positrons generated from photon pair production .",
    "therefore , it could be significantly larger than the goldreich - julian density @xcite .",
    "also , it can be found that @xmath39 and other quantities are insensitive to @xmath46 ( or the real emission volume ) .",
    "actually , the emission volume can be larger than the volume derived from @xmath74 above .    for the radio emission propagating through the plasma",
    ", it is essential that the characteristic plasma frequency must be below the frequency of the propagating radio waves , i.e. , @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the number density of electrons in the comoving frame . using the parameters derived above",
    ", we find this requirement can be satisfied .",
    "in general , both the gravitational potential energy of the asteroid and the magnetic field energy of the ns can provide the energy emitted . if all the energy released is contributed by the former one , i.e. , @xmath77 then the mass needed is @xmath78 g , where @xmath79 is the efficiency of transforming the potential energy into radio radiation and we adopt @xmath80 as the typical value in the following calculations .",
    "this mass is roughly in the mass range of normal asteroids , assuring the self - consistency of our model .",
    "no counterparts associated with frbs have been observed at wavelengths other than the radio range till now , making frbs more mysterious .",
    "a recent multiwavelength follow - up to frb 140514 reveals no variable counterparts or transient emissions associated with it @xcite .",
    "there are two possible reasons for this mysterious fact . on one hand ,",
    "the progenitors of frbs may be such special transient sources so that the duration of signals in other bands are also too short , beyond the reaction capability of telescopes in search .",
    "on the other hand , the flux of frb counterparts may be very weak and be below the detection limit of the telescopes . in our scenario ,",
    "the matter collapsed onto the ns surface may contribute to emissions in other bands .",
    "it is interesting to discuss whether the remnant emissions can be detected by detectors at work .",
    "while some electrons are accelerated to move to the top of the fan , most of the matter collapsed would remain in a column on the ns surface .",
    "the temperature of this matter is high during the impact , and would decrease later when it loses its energy by radiation .",
    "although the cooling process of the hot matter is not clearly known , we can have a rough estimate on the basis of reasonable assumptions .",
    "after the giant flare of 1998 august 27 , transient x - ray emission decaying as @xmath81 was observed from sgr 1900 + 14 .",
    "it was suggested to be the cooling behavior of the heated crust of magnetar @xcite . in our model , we assume that the radiation from the heated matter is thermal and the cooling obeys the same decaying law . thus ,",
    "for a frb at a luminosity distance of @xmath82 , the remnant x - ray light curve is @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the stefan - boltzmann constant and @xmath85 is the temperature of the matter .",
    "the @xmath86 decaying law indicates that the matter cools as @xmath87 .",
    "we further assume the ratio of the energy released in x - ray band to the potential energy is @xmath88 .",
    "then we can obtain @xmath89 and compare it with the sensitivity of current detectors .",
    "figure 2 illustrates the x - ray light curves calculated using different @xmath88 ( ranging from @xmath90 to 1.0 ) , together with the sensitivity line of the @xmath91/x - ray telescope @xcite . from this figure",
    ", it can be seen that the remnant x - ray emission after the collision is well below the sensitivity line and can not be detected .",
    "other factors , e.g. , the spreading of the collapsed matter on the ns surface , and the rotation of the ns , would reduce the flux significantly and are not considered here .",
    "the calculation above is actually an optimistic estimate .",
    "therefore , the x - ray counterparts ( not in the bursting phase ) associated with frbs may not be detected by detectors at work .",
    "in this study , we propose that the impacts between nss and asteroids / comets may be a promising mechanism for frbs . for an asteroid of typical mass of @xmath92 g falling onto the ns surface , a fan of hot plasma would form after the millisecond collision .",
    "the consequent emitting shell at @xmath93 cm , containing electrons / positrons with @xmath94 , will emit in radio wavelength coherently .",
    "the main characteristics of frbs , including the timescale and luminosity , can be well explained in our scenario .",
    "however , the remnant x - ray emission following the frbs will be faint according to the calculations under reasonable assumptions .    in our scenario , @xmath39-ray photons may be emitted , e.g. , by the inverse compton scattering of transient energetic electron / positron pairs on the soft photons within burst timescale",
    ". the @xmath39-ray event may be as short as the radio burst itself , but might last for a rotation period or longer .",
    "the fraction of electron / positron pairs with a high lorentz factor to trigger @xmath39-ray emission is highly uncertain , but we can give a rough estimate based on some simplifications .",
    "we assume the efficiency of transferring the potential energy into @xmath39-ray emission is @xmath95 and the duration @xmath96 is the same to that of radio burst , i.e. , @xmath97 ms",
    ". then we can find the average @xmath39-ray flux during @xmath96 as @xmath98 , which is too low to detect .",
    "the main calculations in this paper are based on the assumption that the frbs are generated at cosmological distances .",
    "nevertheless , our scenario can also work for frbs that somehow happen in local galaxies .",
    "for an frb happens at @xmath99 100 mpc , its isotropic radio energy is then @xmath100 erg . using equation ( 8)",
    ", we can find that the corresponding asteroid mass needed is only @xmath101 g. although the distance is much smaller in this case , the remnant x - ray flux is still low since the potential energy ( and thus the x - ray energy release ) is accordingly reduced .",
    "however , note that the dynamics of small objects ( @xmath102 g ) could be significantly different from that of large objects ( @xmath29 g ) , because the evaporation and electrodynamic effects may be stronger @xcite . a detailed study on these effects will be helpful but it is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "till now , no repeating bursts have been observed from any particular frb sources .",
    "this feature can be reasonably explained in our scenario since a direct collision between an asteroid / comet and the ns can only trigger the burst once , and such collisions are not likely to happen repeatedly on short timescales .",
    "these predictions make our model testable by more observations in the future .",
    "the event rate of frbs is another crucial clue to the progenitors .",
    "the very limited field of view of current large radio telescope makes the observation of large numbers of frbs very difficult .",
    "although only a few frbs have been observed till now , it is widely believed that the actual event rate should be very high , i.e. , @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "we need to know whether this event rate could be explained in our framework .",
    "although it is difficult to assess the exact event rate of our impact processes theoretically , we can give a rough estimate on the basis of some reasonable assumptions .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed for the formation of planetary systems around nss .",
    "the planetary system can be formed along with the progenitor @xcite , from the fall back material after the supernova @xcite , or from the material provided by a lower mass companion @xcite . for a ns with a planetary system ,",
    "it is possible that some asteroids would impact the ns .",
    "first , asteroids could be gravitationally disturbed by other planets and be scattered toward the ns @xcite .",
    "second , the planets may have chances to collide with each other and produce clumps falling to the ns @xcite . in previous studies , the recurrence time ( @xmath103 ) of strong direct impacts ( with @xmath104 g ) in a typical ns planetary system",
    "is estimated to be @xmath105 years @xcite .",
    "noting that the co - moving volume of @xmath106 contains @xmath107 late - type galaxies @xcite , and supposing the number of nss in a typical galaxy is @xmath108 @xcite , the observable event rate of the impact is @xmath109 .",
    "recently the alfvn wing structures formed during the interaction between a relativistic pulsar wind and the orbiting small body were investigated .",
    "it was found that the alfvn wing structures will lead the small bodies in a retrograde orbit to move toward the central ns more rapidly @xcite , which can further increase the collision rate . considering these",
    ", the theoretical event rate can well explain the observed frb rate .",
    "by now , what we are confident about is that the radio emission of frb should be coherent given the millisecond duration and a lower bound on the distance . in fact , what we have proposed is one kind of process that can trigger the coherent emission from the magnetosphere of ns .",
    "the conditions needed to drive the particle bunching , which may involve some kinds of instabilities , is still unclear and is beyond the scope of our work",
    ". future advance in the study of coherent radiation could give more rigorous clues to the progenitors of frbs .",
    "( dotted line ) , 0.1 ( solid line ) , 0.01 ( dash - dotted line ) are adopted during the calculation using equation ( 9 ) .",
    "other quantities are set as typical values , i.e. @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 erg .",
    "the thick dashed line is the sensitivity line of the @xmath91/x - ray telescope @xcite .",
    "note that for the sensitivity line , the x - axis is the integration time , while the y - axis is the corresponding sensitivity limit under this exposure time . ]",
    "we appreciate many helpful comments and suggestions from the anonymous referee .",
