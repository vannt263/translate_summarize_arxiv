    "the idea of quantum pumping , i.e. of producing a dc current at zero bias voltage by time periodic modulation of two system parameters , dates back to the work of thouless @xcite .",
    "the pumping is _ adiabatic _ when the parameters change slowly as compared to all internal time scales of the system and the average charge pumped per period does not depend on the specific time dependence of the parameters . using the concept of emissivity proposed by bttiker et al.@xcite ,",
    "brouwer@xcite related the charge pumped in a period to the derivatives of the instantaneous scattering matrix of the conductor with respect to the time - varying parameters . since then , a general framework to compute the pumped charge through a conductor has been developed for noninteracting and interacting electrons@xcite .",
    "then the interest in the pumping phenomenon has shifted to the experimental@xcite investigations of confined nanostructures , as quantum dots , where the realization of the periodic time - dependent potential can be achieved by modulating gate voltages applied to the structure@xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the modern miniaturization techniques have allowed the realization of artificial structures of the same length scale of molecular objects so that the charge distribution and shape of the system may well change during their operation .",
    "the process of hybridization obtained by joining artificial manmade structures with macromolecules makes possible to get systems whose electrical response is strongly affected by electromechanical tunable interaction .",
    "this happens because at molecular scale the elastic forces controlling the structure of the system are of the same order of magnitude with respect to the electrostatic forces related to the charge distributions .",
    "the interplay between electrostatic and structural degrees of freedom can be experimentally studied by means of the carbon - based technology allowing a full integration between manmade nanostructures and molecular conductors ( as in particular the fullerene @xmath3 ) . in such systems ,",
    "whose theory has been formulated by gorelik _",
    "@xcite , the interplay between mechanical and electromagnetic degrees of freedom is responsible for a mechanical instability that causes a self - oscillating behavior due to a self - consistent bistable potential .",
    "the current induced by this so - called _ _ charge shuttle phenomenon__@xcite is proportional to the frequency of the oscillating part of the system , while the electric charge transported per cycle is an integer multiple of the elementary charge @xmath4 . the coupling between charge transport and vibrational properties of these molecular systems has recently been observed by h. park _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite in an experiment on a single - molecule @xmath3-based transistor .",
    "similar effects have also been observed in experiments on the transport properties of suspended carbon nanotubes where the activation of the breathing modes ( i.e. radial deformations of the nanotube ) has been obtained using an stm ( scanning tunneling microscope ) tip @xcite .",
    "these systems are nowadays known as nanoelectromechanical systems ( nems ) and are very important in clarifying the role of the electron - phonon interactions in molecular conductors and manmade artificial systems . + within the previous scenarios , an interesting question is what type of effect would induce the mechanical degrees of freedom ( oscillations ) on quantum pumping properties . in particular , one can imagine to realize an adiabatic quantum pump with a deformable quantum dot capable of changing its configuration under the combined effect of electrostatic and elastic forces .",
    "this proposal can be realized , for instance , by coupling a suspended nanotube@xcite to external leads through two tunable tunnel barriers .",
    "suspended nanotubes of @xmath5 m of length present a mechanical resonance frequency of @xmath6mhz , i.e. of the same order of the adiabatic pumping frequency and a quality factor @xmath7 ( see for instance fig.3 of ref . [ ] ) .",
    "thus the mentioned molecular systems are good candidates to explore the adiabatic quantum pumping through a deformable system .",
    "+ in this work , by employing a green s function approach , we derive an expression of the adiabatic pumping current through a deformable quantum dot subject to a static electric field @xmath8 generated by a back gate and coupled to two external leads kept at the same chemical potential .",
    "the pumped current in this system is generated by the adiabatic variation of the tunneling rates between the noninteracting leads and the deformable quantum dot . during the pumping cycle",
    "the deformable dot is charged with a finite density and reacting to the presence of the electric field @xmath8 by deforming itself and changing its energy .",
    "the dynamical effects related to the mechanical deformation of the system are considered as adiabatic and are described by using a classical formalism .",
    "the small deformation limit is considered to avoid interesting but very complicated non - linear effects@xcite .",
    "+ an important point is that the parametric pump we have in mind is very different from a shuttle device .",
    "indeed , the shuttle consists of a self - oscillating system able to self - sustain a mechanical oscillation of a small grain when a dc bias is applied to the external leads . in this setup",
    "the charge is transported on the shuttle and is released to the closest lead , the charge on the grain being almost constant during the shuttling time .",
    "thus a crucial ingredient is the possibility to reach closely a given lead to enhance the tunneling rate which then depends strongly on the position of the shuttle in the direction of charge transport ( longitudinal direction ) .",
    "alternatively , we are proposing here a parametric pumping , the only difference from the original work of thouless@xcite being the inclusion of a classical variable associated to the transverse oscillations of the central region subjected to a back gate . in our pumping setup the tunneling rates",
    "are unsensitive to the position of the central region in the longitudinal direction and only depends on the transverse motion of the center of mass of the central region .",
    "the self - oscillating phenomena present in the shuttle dynamics ( see e.g. [ ] ) are then absent in our proposal .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in sec.[sec : model ] we introduce the model hamiltonian and the relevant parameters . in sec.[sec :",
    "x - dyn ] the classical dynamics of the variable @xmath9 describing the motion of the center of mass of the central region is studied within the small deformation limit ( i.e. in linear response ) . in sec.[sec : weak pump ] we derive the weak pumping formula for the current which includes the effects of the additional phase shift @xmath1 due to the dynamics of the @xmath9-variable . in sec.[sec : results ] we present the results of the pumped current at zero temperature by discussing the role of the mechanical oscillations including the effects of the dissipation . some conclusions are given in sec.[sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the system under study is shown in fig.[fig : fig1 ] .",
    "it consists of a deformable quantum dot ( qd ) coupled to two external leads , namely the right lead ( rl ) and the left lead ( ll ) , kept at the same chemical potential @xmath10 .",
    "the middle region is biased by a back gate which generates a time - independent electric field @xmath8 that exerts an electrostatic force @xmath11 , when the electron charge on the qd region is @xmath12 ( being @xmath4 the electron charge ) .",
    "the qd region , which can be made of a nanotube or a @xmath3 molecule , is thus deformed under the effect of @xmath8 and reaches its equilibrium configuration when the elastic force is balanced .",
    "the electron transport in the qd is generated by the adiabatic parametric pumping consisting in the out - of - phase modulation of the two tunnel barrier strength @xmath13 at the interface with the external leads .",
    "+ in order to study the transport through the quantum dot we consider as classical the variables associated to the mechanical deformation of the qd region , namely the position @xmath9 and the momentum @xmath14 of the center of mass , while the electron transport is treated within the quantum theory .",
    "such approximation is justified when the center of mass dynamics is much slower compared to the electron dynamics ( i.e. @xmath15 , being @xmath16 the mechanical frequency of the dot and @xmath17 the tunneling rate controlling the dot - leads dynamics ) . in the following we consider a mechanical frequency @xmath16 of the central region comparable to the frequency @xmath18 of the pump and thus of the order of @xmath19 mhz or less .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the system is the following : @xmath20 where the first term describes the hamiltonian of the free electrons in the ll and rl written in term of the creation ( annihilation ) operators @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) , the second term describes the qd energy in terms of the displacement @xmath9 , the third term represents the tunneling between the leads and the qd , while the last two terms describe the classical degrees of freedom related to the center of mass motion of the qd region having mass @xmath23 and bare resonance frequency @xmath16 .",
    "the energy on the qd thus depends on the classical state of the oscillator while the oscillator is affected by the charge state of the qd .",
    "+ differently from the charge shuttle case , where the tunneling strength @xmath24 depends on the longitudinal position of the shuttle , in the present analysis such dependence is not important and will be neglected in the following analysis .",
    "+ from the classical hamilton equations , @xmath25 , @xmath26 the following equation for the center of mass motion@xcite is obtained : @xmath27 where @xmath28 represents a phenomenological dissipative term . on the r.h.s .",
    "the term @xmath29 is the electrostatic force acting on the deformable dot when the charge density @xmath30 is present on it . under the adiabatic hypothesis ,",
    "the variable @xmath9 and the ac pumping terms @xmath31 can be considered as slow varying parameters and thus we can compute the retarded green s function of the quantum dot within the average - time approximation@xcite : @xmath32 where the wide band limit for the self - energy has been considered , while @xmath33 , @xmath34 being the density of states of the external leads ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the modulation of the tunnel strengths @xmath31 is responsible for an adiabatic modulation of the linewidth @xmath36 , where @xmath37 .",
    "in addition , under no bias voltage applied to the external leads and within the zero temperature limit ( @xmath38 ) , the charge density @xmath30 on the quantum dot region can be determined by the relation @xmath39 whose explicit expression is given by : @xmath40 @xmath10 being the chemical potential of the external leads .",
    "as shown in ( [ eq : charge - density ] ) , the charge density on the dot follows instantaneously the @xmath9-dynamics and thus the equation for the mechanical degree of freedom can be solved at each time .",
    "once the solution for @xmath41 has been obtained , the retarded green s function of the dot can be calculated .",
    "+ the instantaneous current pumped in the lead @xmath42 can be computed within the green s function technique by considering the variation of the charge @xmath43 with respect to the small and slow harmonic variations of the parameters @xmath44 [ ] : @xmath45 . by setting @xmath46 and @xmath47 and by making use of eq.([eq : charge - density ] ) ,",
    "the time derivative of @xmath48 is given by : @xmath49\\partial_t \\gamma(t)\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] noticing that @xmath36 , the r.h.s .",
    "of eq.([eq : charge - der ] ) , can be written as @xmath50 and thus the expression for the current pumped in the lead @xmath42 within the zero temperature limit is recovered@xcite . under time",
    "averaging over one pumping period , the first term in eq.([eq : charge - der ] ) vanishes and the relation @xmath51 is verified .",
    "the dc current pumped per cycle is given by : @xmath52 @xmath18 being the pumping frequency . in the following we focus on the weak pumping limit and confine our analysis to the case of small deformation of the central region . within this approximation the equation of motion of the @xmath9-variable can be linearized and the related solution can be expressed in a simple form .",
    "affects the center of mass dynamics of the qd .",
    "such dynamics takes place in the direction perpendicular to the electrons transport .",
    "the periodic out - of - phase raising / lowering of the barriers strength enables the charge / discharge of the central region which reacts to the electric field @xmath8 due to the electrostatic force.,title=\"fig : \" ] +      in this subsection we treat the dynamics of the @xmath9-variable within the linear approximation and consider the weak pumping limit , @xmath53 .",
    "let us first note that @xmath54 depends on the instantaneous position @xmath9 of the deformable quantum dot and such dependence induces a non linear term in the dynamics as shown by eqs.([eq : dynamics - x ] ) and ( [ eq : charge - density ] ) .",
    "to linearize eq.([eq : dynamics - x ] ) , we expand @xmath55 around the equilibrium position @xmath56 and write @xmath57 . substituting @xmath57 in eq.([eq : charge - density ] ) we get the following weak pumping and small deformation expansion : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is defined from eq.([eq : charge - density ] ) by setting @xmath60 and @xmath61 , while @xmath62^{-1}$ ] , @xmath63 , @xmath64 . substituting eq.([eq : charge - density - expansion ] ) in eq.([eq : dynamics - x ] ) and by introducing the adimensional displacement @xmath65 and time @xmath66 we get the following linear equation : @xmath67 where @xmath2 represents the quality factor of the oscillator ( notice that @xmath68 ) , @xmath69 , while @xmath70 , @xmath71 being the renormalized oscillation frequency : @xmath72 the solution of eq.([eq : dynamics - eta ] ) can be obtained by the classical response function @xmath73 which is solution of the equation @xmath74 where @xmath75 $ ] is a linear differential operator . under the effect of the forcing term @xmath76 , the r.h.s . of the equation ( [ eq : dynamics - eta ] )",
    ", the displacement @xmath77 of the deformable quantum dot can thus be obtained as @xmath78 .",
    "therefore the explicit solution for the @xmath9-variable is : @xmath79 where the quantities @xmath80 and @xmath1 come from the exponential representation @xmath81 of the fourier transform of the response function @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 from eq.([eq : x - solution ] ) is evident that the dynamical phase @xmath1 of the classical response function @xmath85 plays an important role in the quantum pumping .",
    "the knowledge of the dynamics of the deformable quantum dot allows us to derive the retarded green s function eq.([eq : gf ] ) and thus the pumped current .      in this subsection",
    "we derive the expression of the charge current adiabatically pumped under the influence of the center of mass dynamics of the central region . by introducing the retarded green s function in eq.([eq : dc - current ] ) and performing an expansion of the integrand up to second order terms in @xmath86 , the current pumped in the left lead @xmath87 in units of @xmath88 can be written as@xcite : @xmath89,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the _ polaronic energy _",
    "@xmath90 has been introduced .",
    "the current @xmath91 is the current pumped when the quantum dot is in its equilibrium position @xmath56 and whose expression is : @xmath92 eq.([eq : current - bilinear ] ) , which is the main result of this work , clearly shows that the classical phase @xmath1 , coming from the @xmath9-dynamics , may strongly affect the current - phase relation compared to the static situation where an odd behavior of the current with respect to the pumping phase @xmath0 is expected .",
    "when @xmath93 goes to zero , e.g. by switching off the central gate ( @xmath94 ) , the standard weak pumping current is recovered .",
    "furthermore , from detailed analysis of eq.([eq : current - bilinear ] ) one sees that when the pumping frequency @xmath18 becomes very close to the renormalized resonance frequency @xmath71 the pumped current is significantly modified by the additional terms related to the oscillation of the quantum dot . even within the small displacement approximation , the amplitude of the second term on the r.h.s . of the eq.([eq : current - bilinear ] ) proportional to @xmath95 can become comparable to the term proportional to @xmath96 for suitable values of @xmath8 and thus the system may present interesting oscillation - induced effects on the pumped current .",
    "the oscillation - related terms of the current consist of three distinct contributions .",
    "two of them are related to the pumping phase @xmath0 and are proportional to @xmath97 and @xmath98 , while the remaining one is independent from the pumping phase and can be interpreted as a rectification term . concerning the terms containing the pumping phase ,",
    "the current - phase relation is no more an odd function of @xmath0 due to the presence of terms of the form @xmath99 and @xmath100 that can be recognized as interference terms .",
    "if the oscillator has a very high @xmath2 ( low dissipation ) , the terms proportional to @xmath101 become relevant only very close to the resonance frequency ( see fig.([fig : fig2 ] ) ) , while the term proportional to @xmath102 is the dominant one .",
    "thus for weak dissipation , the odd symmetry of the current - phase relation is preserved almost everywhere in the parameters space . on the other hand , when the quality factor of the oscillator is decreased , i.e. for increasing values of the dissipation , the additional terms with phase dependence different from the odd ones start to become relevant .",
    "our analysis thus relates the dissipation of the center of mass motion to the presence of the anomalous terms in the current - phase relation .",
    "+ let us note that the mechanism related to the presence of a dynamical phase shift is more general than the context we are describing here and can in principle be present every time a quantum system is coupled to a subsystem with a classical dynamics ( as , for instance , a classical rlc circuit ) .",
    "+ finally , we also stress that the @xmath103 term of the pumped current we derived in the present analysis has also been obtained in different contexts . for example , in ref .",
    "[ ] where the effect of the inelastic scattering within a two terminal parametric pump was treated by means of the _ fictitious leads method_. in that work a third fictitious lead with a time dependent chemical potential was introduced . in our case , even in the absence of inelastic phenomena , the deformable quantum dot behaves similarly to the fictitious lead of ref . [ ] and thus a @xmath103 term appears . interference - like terms in the current - phase relation were also obtained in ref .",
    "[ ] where an adiabatic quantum pump in the presence of external ac voltages was considered .",
    "in the following we fix the zero of the energy at the fermi level ( @xmath104 ) and consider the zero temperature limit to study the pumped current ( eq.([eq : current - bilinear ] ) ) as a function of the relevant system parameters .",
    "all the energies are expressed in units of @xmath105ev which is of the same order of magnitude of the static linewidth @xmath106 and the _ polaronic energy _",
    "@xmath107 is assumed as a small quantity compared to @xmath108 .",
    "since the _ polaronic energy _ can be tuned by means of the electric field @xmath8 , in the following we assume that the displacement of the central region is a fraction of @xmath109 m and thus @xmath110ev . in starting our analysis",
    "we notice that the behavior of the pumped current depends strongly on the value of the pumping frequency since both the response function @xmath85 and the dynamical phase are functions of @xmath18 .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig.([fig : fig2 ] ) where @xmath101 and @xmath111 are shown as a function of the pumping frequency @xmath18 ( normalized to the mechanical frequency @xmath16 ) while the quality factor is fixed at a relatively low value , @xmath112 ( high - dissipation ) .",

    "furthermore , the specific value of the pumping phase @xmath0 can strongly affect the symmetry of the pumped currents as a function of the pumping frequency .",
