    "correlation of interference over sequential periods of time is an important quantity to study because it affects the correlation of receiver outage , the end - to - end delay , the handoff rate etc .",
    "it arises due to correlations in the propagation channel and the scheme  @xcite . for aloha type of mac ,",
    "the propagation conditions become correlated in time when there are correlations in the fading channel and the user mobility .    keeping in mind the ongoing standardization activities for the deployment of commercial networks ,",
    "the impact of blockage and deployment area on the correlation of interference becomes an attractive topic to study .",
    "thus far , the performance analysis of static networks , e.g.  @xcite neglects the correlation of links that share common obstacles and also assumes infinite deployment area . in  @xcite , these assumptions are not adopted , however , only the short - term correlation of interference is studied using the model , and the user locations are discrete .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a continuous and bounded deployment , and we study the temporal correlation of interference for static users @xmath0 , and users with locations over time .",
    "the former is useful for studying static networks .",
    "the latter can be used to calculate the correlation of interference in highly moving networks @xmath1 and/or the long - term interference correlation in networks with asymptotic independent mobility , e.g. , random walk , brownian motion , constrained mobility with wrap around or bouncing back  @xcite ,  @xcite , etc . studying interference correlation with uncorrelated mobility will also highlight that a bounded domain and/or a domain with blockage can make the interference pattern correlated too . even though the analysis in the space seems to be an over - simplification , it allows getting useful insights about the correlation of interference at a low complexity .",
    "the scenario can also find practical applications , e.g. , in vehicular networks .",
    "next , we summarize the most important insights about the system behaviour which , to the best of our knowledge , are new : ( i ) with uncorrelated user mobility , the temporal correlation of interference becomes inversely proportional to the size of the deployment domain when there is no blockage .",
    "( ii ) with a finite density of blockage , the correlation coefficient stays positive , even if the deployment area is infinite .",
    "this is because blockage introduces correlation in the interference levels generated by different users .",
    "( iii ) in the static case , blockage increases the correlation of interference .",
    "( iv ) with uncorrelated mobility , there is a critical user - to - blockage density ratio that determines the correlation of interference as compared to the case without blockage . at a high density of blockage",
    ", the critical ratio can be expressed in a closed - form .",
    "we consider two independent poisson point processes ( ppps ) , one for the users and the other for the blockage , over the line segment @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "the density of users is @xmath4 and the density of blockage is @xmath5 .",
    "every user transmits with probability @xmath6 , independently of other users and of its own transmissions in previous time slots .",
    "we use a bounded distance - based propagation pathloss model , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the distance and @xmath9 is the pathloss exponent . in order to make the analysis valid also for sub-@xmath10 ghz cellular networks",
    ", we model the fast fading by the rayleigh distrbution with unit mean .",
    "also , there is correlated slow fading due to blockage .",
    "the locations of obstacles are fixed but unknown . the obstacles",
    "do not hinder the user moves but they attenuate the user signal .",
    "it is assumed that the penetration loss per obstacle is uniformly distributed on @xmath11,\\gamma\\leq 1 $ ] .",

    "the distribution of @xmath22 is difficult to obtain in terms of simple functions , however the moments of the penetration loss at distance @xmath25 , i.e. , between the @xmath18-th user and the location @xmath26 can be computed as @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "even though the users are distributed independently of each other , they may be blocked by some common obstacles .",
    "the first - order cross - moment of penetration loss for two users @xmath28 depends on the relative locations of @xmath29 w.r.t .",
    "when the two links @xmath30 and @xmath31 do not share any obstacles , the penetration losses are uncorrelated , @xmath32 . otherwise , @xmath33",

    "we consider static users @xmath0 , and users with infinite velocity @xmath1 . in the former ,",
    "the locations of users are fixed but unknown . in the latter , a new realization of users",
    "is drawn in every time slot . in both cases ,",
    "the statistics of interference are independent of the time slots @xmath34 we take the measurements and the time - lag @xmath45",
    ". therefore the pearson correlation coefficient can be written as @xmath46 for the static case , we denote the correlation coefficient by @xmath47 . for the mobile case ,",
    "we denote it by @xmath48 .",
    "the correlation coefficient is location - dependent but we omit the related index for brevity .",
    "we will show how to calculate the coefficients @xmath49 at the origin .",
    "the expressions at an arbitrary point @xmath14 $ ] can be obtained in a similar manner .",
    "the mean of interference is computed after evaluating the first derivative of the @xmath50 at @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52 where ( a ) follows from the fact that the penetration loss depends on the user location , ( b ) uses that the users are indistinct and also averages over the poisson distribution @xmath53 , @xmath54 is the generalized exponential integral , and the transmit power level has been taken equal to @xmath55 .",
    "the second moment of interference is @xmath56 where it has been used that @xmath57 , and the term @xmath58 captures the correlation in the interference levels generated by different users @xmath59    the calculation of @xmath58 can be split into two terms , @xmath60 , depending on whether pairs of links share common obstacles or not .",
    "the uncorrelated part is equal to @xmath61 , and the correlated part can be written as @xmath62 . in order to calculate @xmath63 ,",
    "one has to take care of the piecewise nature of the pathloss model . for a positive @xmath64",
    ", we finally get @xmath65    in equation  , the integral @xmath66 , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 has the least contribution of the four terms .",
    "it can be computed in terms of the incomplete gamma function only if the constants @xmath69 are equal .",
    "this is not true unless @xmath70 , where the integral becomes trivial to solve and equals @xmath71 . for a positive @xmath5 ,",
    "the integral decays sharply with @xmath72 .",
    "one may avoid numerical integration , and use the laplace method to approximate it instead .",
    "due to the lack of space , we give only the second - order approximation for @xmath73 , @xmath74 , where @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "even this has sufficient accuracy for our problem . for impenetrable blockage",
    ", one has to substitute @xmath77 in equations  ,  . for @xmath77 , equation",
    "becomes indefinite .",
    "one should use @xmath78 instead .",

    "the penetration losses of a single user at different time slots are fully correlated .",
    "hence , @xmath85 where @xmath86 is computed as in  .    with infinite velocity ,",
    "the locations of a user at different time slots are uncorrelated but the penetration losses may still be correlated . hence , @xmath87    using equation  , the first term in equation   can also be written as @xmath88 . the correlation coefficients are computed after substituting equations  ,   in equation  @xmath89      without blockage , the interference levels generated by different users become uncorrelated , i.e. , @xmath90 . after substituting @xmath90 in equation  , and this back in  , we get @xmath91 , and @xmath92    [ remark:1 ] a bounded domain introduces correlation in the distance - based propagation pathloss , and makes the interference level correlated in time , even if the user mobility is uncorrelated . for infinite line , @xmath93 .      with a finite blockage density @xmath95    [ remark:2 ] for infinite line , @xmath96 .",
    "hence , from equation  , @xmath97 .",
    "thus , the coefficient @xmath48 , unlike the coefficient @xmath98 , is positive even if the deployment area is infinite .",
    "[ remark:3 ] starting from equation   and using that @xmath99 , one can show that in a static network , blockage increases the correlation of interference , i.e. , @xmath100 .",
    "[ remark:4 ] using that the pearson correlation coefficient is at most equal to one , one can show that the first derivative of @xmath48 in equation   w.r.t .",
    "@xmath4 is positive .",
    "also , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 .",
    "therefore with uncorrelated mobility , blockage reduces the correlation of interference at low user densities , while the opposite is true at high user densities .",
    "there will be a critical user density @xmath103 where @xmath104 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath105 the ratio of user density to blockage density .",
    "if we expand the moments of interference around @xmath106 , we get @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 . after substituting these approximations in equation",
    ", the correlation coefficients @xmath47 and @xmath48 around @xmath106 , keeping @xmath110 finite or @xmath111 , can be read as @xmath112 where in the expression of @xmath113 , the contribution of the terms @xmath114 has been omitted from the series expansion of the fraction .",
    "this would be a valid approximation for a large @xmath115 .",
    "[ remark:5 ] at a high density of blockage , the correlation coefficients increase with the user - to - blockage density ratio .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : variablelamda ] , we have used equation   to compute the correlation coefficients @xmath116 for various user and blockage densities . in the static case ,",
    "blockage makes the propagation pathloss of different users correlated resulting in higher correlation coefficients than in the case without blockage , see remark  [ remark:3 ] . in the mobile case ,",
    "the impact of blockage on the interference correlation depends on the user density , see remark  [ remark:4 ] : when the user density is low , the interference level is also low , and it would vary significantly with mobility because of the transitions in the propagation conditions , from to and vice versa .",
    "these transitions make the correlation of interference less than in the case without blockage . on the other hand , when the user density is high , the correlation of penetration losses among the user prevails , and mobility does not help much in reducing it .",
    "some users will transit from to but at the same time , some others with transit from to .",
    "overall , the interference level will not vary much .",
    "when @xmath117 , the approximations for a high density of blockage , see equation   become valid . for the parameter settings used to generate fig .",
    "[ fig : variablelamda ] , @xmath118 , we get @xmath119 after neglecting the contribution of the term @xmath114 . from equation",
    "we get @xmath120 for @xmath80 and after neglecting the contribution of the terms @xmath121 .",
    "therefore , @xmath122 for @xmath123 , see fig .  [",
    "fig : variablelamda ] . to sum up , for a high density of blockage",
    ", the critical user - to - blockage density ratio can be expressed in a closed - form in terms of the size of the deployment area @xmath115 , the channel model @xmath124 and the user activity @xmath6 .",
    "when the user density is fixed and finite and the blockage density keeps on increasing , the correlation of penetration losses from different users starts to reduce beyond a certain density of blockage . as a result , the correlation coefficients",
    "@xmath49 will reduce too , see fig .",
    "[ fig : variablemu ] and remark  [ remark:5 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : variablemu ] , we also see that smaller domains @xmath115 are associated with higher correlation coefficients @xmath48 .",
    "this is because a smaller domain results in less randomness in the distance - based propagation pathloss of a user at different time slots . obviously , the impact of distance - based pathloss on the interference is more prominent at low blockage densities . in the static case ,",
    "the size of the deployment domain does not impact much the correlation of interference .",
    "the curves for different domains @xmath115 in fig .",
    "[ fig : variablemu ] practically overlap .",
    "w.r.t . the blockage density .",
    "the parameter settings are available in the caption of fig .",
    "[ fig : variablelamda ] , unless otherwise stated in the legend.,width=336 ]    to get a glimpse on the location - dependent properties of interference correlation , we also study it at the boundary , @xmath125 . without blockage , the correlations coefficients are @xmath91 and @xmath126 .",
    "[ remark:6 ] the coefficient @xmath127 at the boundary is half the coefficient @xmath127 at the center because at the boundary there is more randomness in the distance - based pathloss .    with blockage , the coefficient @xmath47 at the boundary will be marginally higher than the coefficient @xmath47 at the center , because the boundary sees more correlated penetration losses .",
    "on the other hand , the coefficient @xmath48 is smaller at the boundary than at the center , see fig .",
    "[ fig : border ] .",
    "this is because at the boundary , where the level of interference is also less , the randomness in the distance - based propagation pathloss is higher . for increasing density of blockage ,",
    "the generated interference is dominated from the users located close to the boundary .",
    "therefore the higher randomness of the link gains starts to vanish and the correlation becomes less sensitive to the location , see fig .",
    "[ fig : border ] .",
    "it can be shown that for a high density of blockage , the coefficient @xmath48 at the boundary can also be approximated by the expression in equation  .",
    "in this letter , we showed that a bounded domain and/or a domain with blockage can induce temporal correlation of interference even if the user locations are uncorrelated over time . with blockage , the correlation coefficient increases with the density of users .",
    "therefore beamforming techniques , which essentially scale down the density of users generating interference , will scale down the temporal correlation of interference too . extending the results of this paper in two - dimensional areas with beamforming and nonuniform distribution of users , e.g. , due to mobility",
