    "in the present work , we investigate level - set percolation for the gaussian free field on @xmath0 , @xmath1 . this problem has already received much attention in the past , see for instance @xcite , @xcite , and more recently @xcite , @xcite .",

    ", we prove the existence of a non - trivial critical level for all @xmath1 , and the positivity of this critical level when @xmath12 is large enough .",
    "some of our methods are inspired by the recent progress in the study of the percolative properties of random interlacements , where a similar long - range dependence occurs , see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we now describe our results and refer to section [ notation ] for details .",
    "we consider the lattice @xmath0 , @xmath1 , endowed with the usual nearest - neighbor graph structure .",
    "our main object of study is the gaussian free field on @xmath0 , with canonical law @xmath13 on @xmath14 such that , @xmath15 = g ( x , y)$ } , \\text { for all } x , y \\in \\mathbb{z}^d , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 denotes the green function of simple random walk on @xmath0 , see .",
    "note in particular the presence of strong correlations , see .",
    "for any _ level _ @xmath17 , we introduce the ( random ) subset of @xmath0 @xmath18 sometimes called _ excursion set _",
    "( above level @xmath2 ) .",
    "we are interested in the event that the origin lies in an infinite cluster of @xmath19 , which we denote by @xmath20 , and ask for which values of @xmath2 this event occurs with positive probability . since @xmath21\\ ] ] is decreasing in @xmath2 , it is sensible to define the critical point for level - set percolation as @xmath22\\ ] ] ( with the convention @xmath23 ) . a non - trivial phase transition is then said to occur if @xmath24 is finite .",
    "it is known that @xmath25 for all @xmath1 and that @xmath26 ( see @xcite , corollary 2 and theorem 3 , respectively ; see also the concluding remark 5.1 in @xcite to understand why the proof does not easily generalize to all @xmath1 ) .",
    "it is also known that when @xmath27 , for large @xmath2 , there is no directed percolation inside @xmath28 , see @xcite , p. 281",
    "( note that this reference studies the percolative properties of the excursion sets of @xmath29 in place of @xmath30 ) .",
    "it is not intuitively obvious why @xmath9 should be finite , for it seems a priori conceivable that infinite clusters of @xmath19 could exist for _ all _ @xmath31 due to the strong nature of the correlations .",
    "we show in corollary [ c2.7 ] that this does not occur and that @xmath32 in fact , we prove a stronger result in theorem [ t2.6 ] . we define a second critical parameter @xmath33 = 0 \\big\\},\\ ] ] where the event @xmath34 refers to the existence of a ( nearest - neighbor ) path in @xmath28 connecting @xmath35 , the ball of radius @xmath36 around @xmath37 in the @xmath38-norm , to @xmath39 , the @xmath38-sphere of radius @xmath40 around @xmath37 .",
    "it is an easy matter ( see corollary [ c2.7 ] below ) to show that @xmath41 now , we prove in theorem [ t2.6 ] the stronger statement @xmath42 and then obtain as a by - product that @xmath43 ( see theorem [ 2.6 ] below for a precise statement ) .",
    "this immediately leads to the important question of whether @xmath9 and @xmath10 actually coincide . in case",
    "they differ , our results imply a marked transition in the decay of the connectivity function of @xmath28 at @xmath44 , see remark [ 2.8 ] below .    our second result concerns the critical level @xmath9 in high dimension .",
    "we are able to show in theorem [ t3.3 ] that @xmath45 this is in accordance with recent numerical evidence , see @xcite , chapter 4 .",
    "we actually prove a stronger result than .",
    "namely , we show that one can find a positive level @xmath46 , such that for large @xmath12 , the restriction of @xmath47 to a thick two - dimensional slab percolates , see above .",
    "let us however point out that , by a result of @xcite ( see p. 1151",
    "therein ) , the restriction of @xmath48 to @xmath49 ( viewed as a subset of @xmath0 ) , and , a fortiori , the restriction of @xmath28 to @xmath49 , when @xmath2 is positive , do only contain finite connected components : excursion sets above any non - negative level do not percolate in planes .",
    "we refer to remark [ concrems ] 1 ) for more on this .",
    "we now comment on the proofs .",
    "we begin with .",
    "the key ingredient is a certain ( static ) renormalization scheme very similar to the one developed in section 2 of @xcite for the problem of percolation of the vacant set left by random interlacements ( for a precise definition of this model , see @xcite , section 1 ; we merely note that the two `` corresponding '' quantities are @xmath28 and @xmath50 , the vacant set at level @xmath51 )",
    ". we will be interested in the probability of certain crossing events viewed as functions of @xmath52 , @xmath53\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( see for the precise definition ) , where @xmath54 is a geometrically increasing sequence of length scales , see .",
    "note that by , @xmath55 is decreasing in @xmath2 .",
    "we then explicitly construct an increasing but bounded sequence @xmath56 , with ( finite ) limit @xmath57 , such that @xmath58 this readily implies , since @xmath59 for all @xmath60 , hence @xmath61 vanishes . by separating combinatorial complexity estimates from probabilistic bounds in @xmath62 ,",
    "see and lemma [ l2.1 ] , we are led to investigate the quantity @xmath63 \\end{split}\\ ] ] ( see for the precise definition ) , where the @xmath64 boxes are indexed by the `` leaves '' of a dyadic tree of depth @xmath65 .",
    "the key to proving is to provide a suitable induction step relating @xmath66 to @xmath67 , for all @xmath60 , where the increase in parameter @xmath68 allows to dominate the interactions ( `` sprinkling '' ) .",
    "this appears in proposition [ p2.2 ] .",
    "one then makes sure that @xmath69 is chosen small enough by picking @xmath46 large , see theorem [ t2.6 ] .",
    "the resulting estimates are fine enough to imply not only that @xmath70 , but even the stretched exponential decay of the connectivity function of @xmath71 , thus yielding .",
    "the proof of then only requires a refinement of this argument .",
    "note that the strategy we have just described is precisely the one used in @xcite for the proof of a similar theorem in the context of random interlacements .",
    "we actually also provide a generalization of proposition [ p2.2 ] , which is of independent interest , but goes beyond what is directly needed here , see proposition 2.2. it has a similar spirit to the main renormalization step leading to the decoupling inequalities for random interlacements in @xcite , see remark [ r2.3 ] .",
    "we now comment on the proof of , which has two main ingredients .",
    "the first ingredient is a suitable decomposition of the field @xmath30 restricted to the subspace @xmath72 into the sum of two independent gaussian fields .",
    "the first field has independent components and the second field only acts as a `` perturbation '' when @xmath12 becomes large , see lemmas [ l3.1 ] and [ l3.2 ] below .",
    "the second ingredient combines the fact that the critical value of bernoulli site percolation on @xmath72 is smaller than @xmath73 ( see @xcite ) , with static renormalization ( see chapter @xmath74 of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and a peierls - type argument to control the perturbation created by the second field .",
    "this actually enables us to deduce a stronger result than .",
    "namely , we show in theorem [ t3.3 ] that one can find a level @xmath75 and a positive integer @xmath76 , such that for large @xmath12 and all @xmath77 , the excursion set @xmath19 already percolates in the two - dimensional slab @xmath78    as already pointed out , some of our proofs employ strategies similar to those developed in the study of the percolative properties of the vacant set left by random interlacements , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this is not a mere coincidence , as we now explain .",
    "continuous - time random interlacements on @xmath0 , @xmath1 , correspond to a certain poisson point process of doubly infinite trajectories modulo time - shift , governed by a probability @xmath79 , with a non - negative parameter @xmath80 playing the role of a multiplicative factor of the intensity measure pertaining to this poisson point process ( the bigger @xmath80 , the more trajectories `` fall '' on @xmath0 ) , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this poisson gas of doubly infinite trajectories ( modulo time - shift ) induces a random field of occupation times @xmath81 ( so that the interlacement at level @xmath80 coincides with @xmath82 , whereas the vacant set at level @xmath80 equals @xmath83 ) . this field",
    "is closely linked to the gaussian free field , as the following isomorphism theorem from @xcite shows : @xmath84 it is tempting to use this identity as a transfer mechanism , and we hope to return to this point elsewhere .",
    "we conclude this introduction by describing the organization of this article . in section",
    "[ notation ] , we introduce some notation and review some known results concerning simple random walk on @xmath0 and the gaussian free field . section [ nontrivial pt ] is devoted to proving that excursion sets at a high level do not percolate .",
    "the main results are theorem [ t2.6 ] and corollary [ c2.7 ] .",
    "the positivity of the critical level in high dimension and the percolation of excursion sets at low positive level in large enough two - dimensional slabs is established in theorem [ t3.3 ] of section [ poslarged ] .    one final remark concerning our convention regarding constants : we denote by @xmath85 positive constants with values changing from place to place .",
    "numbered constants @xmath86 are defined at the place they first occur within the text and remain fixed from then on until the end of the article . in sections",
    "[ notation ] and [ nontrivial pt ] , constants will implicitly depend on the dimension @xmath12 .",
    "in section [ poslarged ] however , constants will be purely numerical ( and _ independent _ of @xmath12 ) . throughout the entire article , dependence of constants on additional parameters",
    "will appear in the notation .",
    "in this section , we introduce some notation to be used in the sequel , and review some known results concerning both simple random walk and the gaussian free field .",
    "we denote by @xmath87 the set of natural numbers , and by @xmath88 the set of integers .",

    "we also introduce the diameter of any subset @xmath114 , @xmath115 , as its @xmath38-diameter , i.e. @xmath116 .",
    "we endow @xmath0 with the nearest - neighbor graph structure , the edge - set consisting of all pairs of sites @xmath117 , @xmath118 , such that @xmath119 .",
    "a ( nearest - neighbor ) path is any sequence of vertices @xmath120 , where @xmath121 and @xmath122 for all @xmath123 , satisfying @xmath124 for all @xmath125 .",
    "moreover , two lattice sites @xmath126 will be called @xmath127-nearest neighbors if @xmath128 .",
    "a @xmath127-path is defined accordingly .",
    "thus , any site @xmath98 has @xmath129 nearest neighbors and @xmath130 @xmath127-nearest neighbors .",
    "we now introduce the ( discrete - time ) simple random walk on @xmath0 . to this end",

    "furthermore , we write @xmath135 for the canonical law of the walk starting at @xmath98 and @xmath136 for the corresponding expectation . we denote by @xmath16 the green function of the walk , i.e. @xmath137 , \\qquad \\text{for } x , y \\in \\mathbb{z}^d,\\ ] ] which is finite ( since @xmath138 ) and symmetric .",
