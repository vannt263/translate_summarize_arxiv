    "smaller galaxies may be even more prone to gas outflows due to their shallow gravitational potential wells .",

    "however , most nearby dwarf galaxies , especially dsphs , have not experienced appreciable star formation for several gyr . as a result , it is even more difficult to observe gas expelled from local group dwarfs because it must have happened so long ago .",

    "this model provides good matches to the abundance distributions of the less luminous dsphs .",
    "the inferred star formation histories also were qualitatively consistent with histories measured from color - magnitude diagrams .",
    "essentially , nearly all stars in the less luminous dsphs are ancient , and they formed in 2  gyr or less",
    ". however , the models for the most luminous dsphs ( fornax , leo  i , and to some extent , leo  ii ) have chemically measured star formation durations of only @xmath10  gyr .",
    "the color - magnitude diagrams for these galaxies rule out such short star formation lifetimes , and they also rule out single bursts of star formation .",
    "these dsphs experienced several epochs of an increase in star formation rate ( sfr ) followed by a decrease .",
    "the @xcite models permit only one episode of star formation ( a single rise and fall of sfr ) .",
    "therefore , the models are imperfect descriptions of fornax , leo  i , and possibly leo  ii .    on the other hand , for an old enough population , such as the mw dsphs , most of the sne that will ever explode have already exploded .",
    "therefore , the star formation history ( sfr as a function of time ) has a small effect on the total metal production integrated over cosmic time .",

    "if type  ia sne have a prompt component @xcite , then the type  ia sne at early times could feed the same wind as the type  ii sne .",
    "however , the delayed type  ia sne at late times explode at a low rate . without continuous explosions ,",
    "it may not be possible to drive a wind .",
    "nonetheless , nearly all dsphs are free of gas .",
    "therefore , the `` missing metals''the difference between the current metal content of the dsph and the amount of metals estimated to have been produced by all of the dsph s sne  have left the dsphs , whether in coherent winds or otherwise .",
    "@xcite assumed that the composition of the gas lost to sn winds was the same as the gas within the galaxy at the time of loss .",
    "however , outflows could be metal - enhanced , especially because the sne that expel gas from the galaxy are the same events that enrich the galaxy with metals @xcite .",
    "the mass of the outflow is related inversely to its unknown metallicity , and @xcite showed that increasing the outflowing metallicity decreased the total amount of galactic mass loss required by as much as a factor of 40 .",
    "given this uncertainty , we estimate only the mass in ejected metals and not the total mass of ejected material . the uncertainty in the metallicity of the outflows does not extend to the independent estimate of the ejected metal mass .",
    "figure  [ fig : ejecta ] shows the mass in each of several metals lost to sn winds summed over 10  gyr . not surprisingly , the dsphs with larger stellar masses eject more metals than the dsphs with smaller stellar masses .",
    "the @xmath60 relation is linear , which is the result expected if the dsphs lost all of their metals .",

    ", the dsphs could not have truly lost all of their metals because the stars are not metal - free . however , the amount of metals retained ( @xmath61 , the filled points in figure  [ fig : ejecta ] ) in stars is tiny compared to the amount of metals produced .",

    "given its stellar mass of @xmath63 , fornax s stars contain @xmath64 of fe .",
    "even though fornax retained the highest fraction of fe of all eight dsphs considered here , the galaxy presently has only 4% of the fe that it produced . in ursa minor , that fraction is only 0.2% .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : ejecta ] expresses metal retention in another way .",
    "the black circles show the stellar mass - iron metallicity relation for mw dsphs @xcite .",
    "the other points show the mass - metallicity relations for other elements .",
    "the smaller dsphs retain a larger fraction of @xmath1 elements relative to iron than the larger dsphs .",
    "the dependence on stellar mass indicates that the larger dsphs formed stars for longer and therefore experienced a higher ratio of type  ia to type  ii sne .",
    "the mass - metallicity relation indicates that the more massive dsphs retained more of their metals in stars rather than losing them to galactic winds .",
    "therefore , the less massive dsphs contribute a larger fraction of their metal mass to the igm or to their host galaxies . to further explore the importance of small dsphs , we convolve the ejected mass function with the stellar mass function for mw dsphs . @xcite calculated the luminosity function of mw dsphs by correcting the observed sloan digital sky survey luminosity function for sky coverage and bias against low surface brightness dsphs .",
    "the result was @xmath65 . assuming the stellar mass - to - light ratio for an old population , @xmath66 , the relation becomes @xmath67 where @xmath68 is measured in @xmath5 .",
    "figure  [ fig : massfunction ] shows the product of this dsph mass function and the ejected mass function from figure  [ fig : ejecta ] .",
    "even though the small dsphs are more numerous , they are not significant contributors to igm metals . even if the relation for the smaller dsphs is extrapolated to zero mass , then all dsphs the size of leo  i or smaller contributed just @xmath69 of fe to the igm over 10  gyr .",
    "fornax alone provided more fe , and even more massive galaxies likely make fornax s contribution negligible .",
    "the same argument applies to the other metals as well .",
    "averaged over a long enough time , the ratio of the numbers of type  ii to type  ia sne asymptotes to the same value in all dsphs as long as the imf is the same . as a result ,",
    "the [ @xmath1/fe ] ratios of ejecta from dsphs integrated over 10  gyr are not functions of stellar mass . expressed relative to the solar ratios , the 10  gyr ratios for our adopted sn yields and our adopted imf are @xmath70 } = -0.45 $ ] , @xmath71 } = -0.15 $ ] , and @xmath72 } = -0.30 $ ] .    , which is the expected relation if dsphs lost all of the metals they produced .",

    "bottom : the stellar mass - metallicity relation for the stars in dsphs @xcite .",
    "metallicity is given separately as [ fe / h ] , [ mg / h ] , [ si / h ] , and [ ca / h].[fig : ejecta ] ]    , * ? ? ?",
    "the dashed line shows @xmath73 .",
    "the axes are logarithmic , and the metal output from small dsphs is negligible compared to large dsphs.[fig : massfunction ] ]",
    "@xcite theorized that gas - rich dirrs can be converted into gas - free dsphs by interaction with their host galaxies .",
    "tidal stirring can turn disks into spheroids , and ram pressure stripping  in addition to supernova - driven outflow  can remove all of the gas . with this relationship between dirrs and dsphs in mind , we compare our inferences for the metals ejected from dsphs to the observed metal content of the wind presently flowing out the post - starburst dirr ngc  1569 ( @xmath74 , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite estimated that the most recent starburst in that galaxy ejected @xmath75 of oxygen .",
    "they based this estimate on an x - ray spectral fit to several @xmath1 elements , including o and mg . in order to compare to our own ejected metal estimates , we note that @xmath76 is related to @xmath77 by a multiplicative factor ( about 15 , which is also the solar ratio ) because both elements are formed in similar nucleosynthetic processes in massive stars .",
    "therefore , the starburst must have ejected @xmath78 of magnesium .",
    "the mass of stars formed in the burst was @xmath79 over 1020  myr .",
    "ngc  1569 is more massive than any of the dsphs we consider , and the sfr in the burst was much higher than the average rates in the dsphs . nonetheless , the outflowing magnesium mass from the recent burst in ngc  1569 agrees remarkably well with the relation between @xmath77 and @xmath68 defined by mw dsphs .",
    "figure  [ fig : ejecta ] shows that the ngc  1569 outflow falls exactly in line between leo  i and leo  ii . of course , we must keep in mind that we are considering only the very recent starburst and not the entire galaxy , which is 50  times more massive . however , only the ejecta of the current starburst is directly measurable , and the measurement is uncertain by a factor of at least 2 .",
    "@xcite also measured the [ @xmath1/fe ] ratio to be 0.30.6 ( 24 times solar ) .",
    "this value is larger than what we infer for the mw dsphs .",
    "however , the winds flowing out of ngc  1569 came from a very short burst ",
    "likely short enough that type  ia sn ejecta is not present in the winds .",
    "therefore , the [ @xmath1/fe ] ratios merely reflect the fact that the star formation was intense in the recent burst in ngc  1569 but not in the dsphs .",
    "@xcite s completely independent method for measuring the metal content of galactic winds has placed a different , though possibly related , type of dwarf galaxy on the same @xmath80@xmath68 relation as the one defined by mw dsphs .",
    "this result has several implications .",
    "first , ngc  1569 retained almost none of the metals produced in its recent starburst , a result that @xcite  found from their own chemical evolution model .",
    "second , the theoretical sn yields are accurate enough to place the observed magnesium mass ejected from ngc  1569 on the same relation as the the masses ejected from dsphs , which were calculated from the theoretical yields .",
    "finally , even a galaxy as massive as ngc  1569 ( @xmath81  km  s@xmath82 , * ? ? ?",
    "* compared to 10  km  s@xmath82 for a typical dsph ) loses nearly all of the metals it produces .",
    "the possibility that the majority of metals that currently reside in the igm were originally ejected by low - mass systems @xcite emphasizes the need for constraints on models for galactic outflows .",
    "galaxy evolution models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) generally assume that star - forming galaxies drive outflows whose metallicity tracks the interstellar medium , and whose outflowing mass is proportional to @xmath83 . here , @xmath84 is the velocity dispersion that scales with the halo mass ( @xmath85 ) , and @xmath1 is a scaling parameter . setting @xmath86 yields a momentum - driven scaling , and @xmath87 yields a energy - driven scaling .",
    "some models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) invoke a stronger scaling ( @xmath88 ) in order to match the faint end of the luminosity function .",
    "let us assume that the metallicity of outflowing gas @xmath89 tracks the stellar metallicity @xmath90 , which in turn scales with stellar mass as @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "let us further assume the stellar mass  halo mass scaling that is observed at low masses ( @xmath92 , * ? ? ?",
    "the mass in ejected metals is the outflow mass multiplied by the wind metallicity .",
    "therefore , the model assumptions correspond to the assumption that @xmath93 , or @xmath94 and @xmath95 for momentum - driven and energy - driven scalings , respectively",
    ". taken at face value , our observation of the ejected mass relation , @xmath96 , favors an energy - driven scaling .",
    "we emphasize that these inferences depend strongly on the assumed stellar mass  halo mass relation as well as the metallicities within the outflows .",
    "they also neglect many physical processes , such as tidal stripping , that could preferentially affect low - mass systems .",
    "furthermore , much of the metals from type  ia sne are lost well after the cessation of star formation and well after the galaxies are devoid of interstellar gas . that makes the distinction between energy- and momentum - driven winds poorly defined .",
    "these uncertainties emphasize the need for improved observational constraints on the kinematics of low - mass systems as well as the mass - loading and metal mass fractions of outflows from low - mass galaxies .",
    "the biggest limitation of our approach at measuring @xmath58 is that we have measured the mass only in metals .",
    "we provide no constraints on the total outflowing mass , including hydrogen .",
    "therefore , we also provide no constraints on the metal fraction of the outflows .",
    "one way to constrain the metallicity is to fix the total mass participating in gas flows and star formation .",
    "for instance , we could assume that the baryonic mass associated with a dsph obeys the cosmic baryon - to - dark matter ratio .",
    "unfortunately , the disconnect between stellar and dark matter mass @xcite and the tidal interactions @xcite of mw dsphs make it impossible to estimate their total , original dark matter masses .",
    "semi - analytic models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may provide a path forward . by treating a variety of processes that likely affected dsph growth , such as tidal stripping , pre - enriched inflows , and returning outflows , they provide a flexible but complete account of how outflows impact metallicities . a model galaxy",
    "whose chemical abundances match observed abundance distributions @xcite and our inferred ejected metal masses might inform us about these processes .",
    "we encourage interested modelers to interrogate their existing semi - analytic models for unique constraints that our observations place on the way in which low - mass galaxies process their gas into outflows , stars , and evolving gas reservoirs .",
