    "this second option can be excluded if one can make sure that no @xmath141-spheres are ever coned off ( for example , if the whole contractible space is @xmath141-dimensional ) and then the argument works .",

    "now for these @xmath146 and @xmath154 , we see that this map induces the trivial map in homotopy up to dimension @xmath155 if and only if the homotopy groups vanish on @xmath145 .",
