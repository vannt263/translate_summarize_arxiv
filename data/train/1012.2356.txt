    "[ fig : frictionev ] .",
    "points on the contour slightly behind the local maxima will quickly overtake the points with the same @xmath17-values but slightly ahead of the maximum , as those have nonpositive @xmath33 and hence are frozen by the step function factor .",
    "this causes the two pieces of the contour to overlap , and is analogous to the formation of shocks in the inviscid burgers equation .",
    "the `` horizontal '' discontinuity this creates is depicted in the figure as dotted lines . based on the physical interpretation of the equation ,",
    "the way to deal with this multivaluedness is to amputate the portion of the contour where this has occurred , as in the figure .",
    "this generates a corner in @xmath0 ( though in the pictured example , the contour began with corners at the maxima ) .",
    "there are also problematic points around a local minimum of @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath34 be the coordinates of the local minimum on the initial contour .",
    "since @xmath35 , all points @xmath36 ahead of this minimum will have traveled a nonzero angular distance along their characteristics at any @xmath37 , which results in a growing gap of undefined points ( i.e.  points such that eq .",
    "( [ eqn : char ] ) has no solution in @xmath16 at a given @xmath2 ) between @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the obvious thing to do is to interpolate by setting @xmath40 for all @xmath1 in this interval , as this is the only natural way to ensure that the shape remains continuous .",
    "thus intervals of constant @xmath17 ( circular arcs ) are continually growing at local minima .",
    "the two cases just described are the simplest cases where the evolution along characteristics must be repaired to become continuous .",
    "there are several more similar cases involving intervals of constant @xmath17 which lead to multivaluedness ( or no - valuedness ) , but they are all treated by either amputation or interpolation , as described above . in the terminology of melikyan @xcite ,",
    "the points of amputation are `` equivocal '' and the points of interpolation are `` dispersal '' .",
    "from the considerations above , giving an explicit formula for the solution would involve several layers of if - then constructs .",

    "we also give the positions of the endpoints separating these intervals as a function of time .",
    "we define _ rising _ and _ falling faces _ of the contour to be connected components of points on the contour with @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",

    "the shearing is caused by points moving with speed proportional to their radius .",
    "we will call intervals of constant @xmath17 ( circular ) _ arcs _ , and we will classify these into four types . _ rising _ and _ falling arcs _ are those that are adjacent to rising , respectively falling faces on both sides . _",
    "min _ and _ max arcs _ are those which contain local minima , respectively maxima of the contour .",
    "thus , @xmath0 at any fixed time decomposes into a set of faces and arcs .",
    "the evolution of each face or arc can be treated independently of the others for almost all times except for a discrete set of events when a face or arc changes into another type or disappears .",
    "the endpoints of faces or arcs fall into three categories named according to their behavior under time evolution : _ stationary endpoints _ , _ interpolating endpoints _ , and _",

    "the intersection of the area under the contour with a circle of radius @xmath17 will be several disjoint arcs . from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : char ] ) these shrink in time as the left endpoint of each moves with speed @xmath46 towards the right , until the moment this value of @xmath17 is amputated and the entire interval has vanished",
    ". the remaining lifetime of a point @xmath49 inside the contour at time @xmath2 is thus @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the angular distance along the circle of radius @xmath17 from @xmath49 to the left endpoint of its interval on the contour at time @xmath2 . at fixed @xmath17 , @xmath52",
    ", where @xmath53 is the position of this left endpoint on the initial contour , i.e. @xmath53 is an appropriate solution of @xmath54 .    for an amputating endpoint that lies between a rising and falling face , the angular position as a function of time follows the contour of the falling face .",
    "its position is a solution @xmath55 of @xmath56 .",
    "one limit to keep in mind is when the falling face is vertical .",

    "the opposite limit is when the amputating endpoint lies between a rising face and an arc with radius @xmath17 , then the endpoint moves to the right with constant speed @xmath46 .",
    "the nature of the above decomposition of the contour into faces and arcs changes precisely when endpoints collide with each other and faces and arcs merge .",

    "let @xmath65 .",
    "the initial contour ( for @xmath66 ) takes the form @xmath67    in the first instant of time , the local minima at @xmath68 expand by interpolation into min arcs , so the initial contour consists of a min arc of zero width at each of these local minima , each sandwiched between a falling face and a rising face .",
    "[ fig : frictionev ] depicts the first interval of time in the case @xmath69 , where the amputating endpoints at the local maxima ( initially at positions @xmath70 ) move to the right and the interpolating endpoints at the local minima do as well .",
    "the solution in this first time interval consists 12 piecewise smooth curves , four each of min arcs , rising faces , and falling faces ( though there is a @xmath71 periodicity of the contour in @xmath1 which is preserved by the evolution , simplifying matters somewhat ) .",
    "this proceeds until time @xmath72 when the points on the contour above @xmath73 have all been amputated , and we remove the corresponding rising and falling faces . if @xmath74 , the contour now consists of 8 piecewise smooth curves , two each of max arcs , min arcs , rising faces , and falling faces , as in the bottom left of fig .",
    "[ fig : tree ] .",
    "the max arcs vanish at time @xmath75 . during the final phase of the evolution , the contour consists of 6 piecewise smooth curves , two each of min arcs , rising faces and falling faces .",
    "the rising faces and falling faces all vanish at time @xmath76 and for all later times the contour is a circle with radius @xmath77 .",
    "the constructions in the previous section are a bit unwieldy to write out by hand , though it is straightforward to program a computer to map @xmath78 to @xmath14 and thus solve the evolution to the precision of the initial data @xmath14 .",
    "the complexity is all in how the pattern of arcs and faces changes over time . in this section , we extract from the solution above a more combinatorial model of the evolution that focuses on this pattern and may make it more intuitive .     from the origin to the long sides and the distance @xmath79 to the short sides .",
    "the lengths of the edges , corresponding to the widths of radial slices of the pebble , change in time according to their color and position ",
    "black edges at level @xmath80 shrink with rate @xmath81 , white edges sandwiched between black edges grow with rate @xmath81 .",
    "( bottom ) the contour and tree after the four original corners of the rectangle have been amputated.,width=264 ]    first , identify all values of @xmath17 such that the initial contour has a point where @xmath82 ( do not count corners at maxima ) .",
    "order these values from minimum to maximum to define @xmath83 .",
    "geometrically , these critical values are the radii of circles centered at the origin which are tangent to the contour",
    ". these will be the @xmath84 `` levels '' of a planar tree graph which we are constructing , which represents something like a skeleton of the contour .",
    "for example , regular polygons have only one level , the distance from the origin to any edge , and the rectangle discussed earlier has two levels , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "consider the set of intervals arising from the intersection of a circle of radius @xmath87 with the area below the contour",
    ". cut each interval in this set into black and white edges as follows : every subinterval which contains arcs ( i.e. a segment on the contour coincident with the circle of radius @xmath87 ) becomes a white edge , and all other subintervals become black edges .",
    "note that the black edges correspond to subintervals which support some hump of the contour .",
    "each edge is assigned a length equal to the angular width of its subinterval .",
    "the edges just constructed constitute all the edges at level @xmath80 .",
    "an example of white and black edge assignments can be seen on the left of fig .",
    "[ fig : tree ] .",
    "we will now glue these edges into a planar tree .",
    "first , create a root vertex at level 1 .",
    "attach one end of every edge at level 1 to this root vertex , preserving the cyclic ordering of edges .",
    "next , create a vertex at every black edge whose corresponding hump has intervals at level 2 above it , and then attach one end of every edge at level 2 to the appropriate vertex , preserving the linear ordering . repeat this process of creating vertices and gluing for each remaining level .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : tree ] for the example of a rectangle . roughly speaking",
    ", the tree captures the pattern of the protrusions of the contour as we move from the origin outwards .",
    "note that the edges at level @xmath80 are not necessarily all attached to edges at level @xmath88 .",
    "the dynamics of endpoints , faces and arcs yields the following rules for the evolution of the tree . as time progresses , every black edge at level @xmath80 shrinks at the rate @xmath81 .",
    "white edges at level @xmath80 which happen to be sandwiched between black edges ( in the cyclic ordering around the root if @xmath89 , or the linear ordering above a vertex if @xmath90 ) grow at the same rate @xmath81 .",
    "white edges at level @xmath90 which sit alone on a vertex shrink at the rate @xmath81 .",
    "the lengths of all other white edges are held constant .",
    "if the length of an edge shrinks to zero , we remove it ; if two white edges become adjacent on a vertex , we merge them into one white edge with length equal to the sum of their lengths .    under this evolution , the tree contracts from the leaves inwards ; the edges supporting a branch will never vanish before the edges at higher levels connected to it .",
    "the total time of evolution is thus determined by the length of the longest black edge at level 1 . translating back to the original contour ,",
    "this means we just need to measure the angular width of the base of the largest hump .",
    "therefore the contours with fixed minimum radius which take longest to evolve to a circle are those with a single minimum radius .",
    "the tree picture also makes it clear that all contours evolve to a circle with radius equal to the minimum radius of the initial shape .    at all times",
    "the pattern of white edges and black edges at different levels on the tree may be used to reconstruct a coarse version of the contour at that point in time .",
    "this is not a one - to - one correspondence between trees and contours , as there many possible contours that lead to the same tree .",
    "more explicitly , one can place at the left and right of the intervals corresponding to each black edge an arbitrary increasing function ( rising face ) between the radii @xmath87 to @xmath91 , respectively decreasing function ( falling face ) , provided the angular widths of these two functions is consistent with the lengths of the edges above and the length of this black edge .",
    "indeed , not even the maximum height of each hump enters this description .",
    "however , all contours that lead to the same tree have the same pattern of face and arc disappearances .",
    "this property gives some stability to the evolution ",
    "if noise is added to the initial contour , this will only affect the long term behavior insofar as it might change the widths of the bases of the large scale features .",
    "small humps coming from the short - wavelength part of the noise will correspond to short edges on the tree which quickly vanish or merge with the large edges .",
    "the solution in this paper generalizes easily to the case where the equation takes the form @xmath92 with nondecreasing @xmath93 in place of @xmath46 .",
    "if @xmath93 is not nondecreasing the solution above will be modified significantly as then some points of the contour would propagate in the opposite direction .",
    "however , a choice like this would also seem physically unmotivated .",
    "the function @xmath93 allows for more general radius - speed relations , and the tree picture makes it clear that all that changes is the relative rate of growth or shrinkage of each edge , and not the overall qualitative picture ; in particular , this may explain the observation in @xcite that the model was robust to changing @xmath17 to @xmath94 with @xmath95 .",
    "we speculate next on some possible choices for @xmath93 .",
    "the rectangle is the most interesting case studied by roth , marques and durian , as it is the only contour with two widely - separated levels . in their data",
    "( see rightmost panel of fig .  2 in @xcite )",
    ", two of the corners are abraded before the other two , whereas the model predicts that all four corners vanish at the same time ( @xmath96 in the notation of the end of sec .",
    "thus the `` constant '' @xmath4 may differ between the rising faces , perhaps being larger if the radii of the preceding minimum is smaller , and more generally , the speed @xmath93 might in general be a function not just of @xmath17 but also of @xmath97 of the face as well . in principle , ( different branches of ) @xmath98 can be extracted from experimentally measured curve contours by computing @xmath99 , @xmath33 and comparing them at fixed @xmath17 , but preliminary analysis of data provided by roth , marques and durian was not conclusive due to the difficulty of estimating @xmath99 accurately .",
    "we did not carry out an extensive comparison here with the numerical solution of @xcite , but the plotted curves appeared indistinguishable in a few checks .",
    "indeed , it would be interesting to place this work on firmer mathematical ground along the lines of @xcite by analyzing how the corners generated by the amputation and interpolation processes are smoothed by the addition of higher derivative terms , and how this happens in the finite difference scheme of roth , marques and durian . we also did not yet attempt to calculate the typical evolution of area , perimeter and other geometric quantities from our exact solution .",
    "finally , we leave open the question whether erosion or shape evolution models in general may be simplified by posing them as laws for evolving tree graphs",
    ". in particular , it may be easier to construct models for the evolution of an ensemble of pebbles in terms of a mean - field model on trees , rather than attempt a more direct description of ensembles of interacting contours .",
