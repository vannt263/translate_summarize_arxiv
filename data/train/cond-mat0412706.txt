    "low temperature adsorption of highly quantal fluids , such as helium or _ para_-hydrogen ( 2 ) on the outer surface of a fullerene (  buckyball \" ) can provide insight into physical properties of a quantum many - body system confined to spatial regions of nanometer size .",
    "as the diameter of the fullerene is increased , the properties of the adsorbate ought to interpolate between those of a cluster with a solvated impurity , and those of an adsorbed film on an infinite substrate .    in this paper , we consider adsorption of 2 on a single fullerene c@xmath0 , with @xmath1=20 , 36 , 60 and 80 .",
    "all of these molecules are strong adsorbers , and very nearly spherical .",
    "background for this study is provided by the wealth of theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite work , spanning over two decades , aimed at investigating the properties of adsorbed 2 films on various substrates .",
    "this work is also inspired by recent theoretical results on adsorption of helium on buckyballs .",
    "@xcite    a fluid of 2 molecules is an interesting physical system for a number of reasons .",
    "because a 2 molecule is half as light as a helium atom , zero - point motion can be expected to be quite significant ; each molecule is a spin - zero boson , and therefore it is conceivable that , at low enough temperature , a 2 fluid might display physical behavior similar to that of fluid helium , including superfluidity .",
    "@xcite unlike helium , though , bulk _",
    "p_-h@xmath2 solidifies at low temperature ( @xmath3 14 k ) ; this prevents the observation of phenomena such as bose condensation and , possibly , superfluidity , which are speculated to occur in the liquid phase below @xmath4 @xmath5 6 k. solidification is due to the depth of the attractive well of the potential between two hydrogen molecules , which is significantly greater than that between two helium atoms .",
    "several , attempts have been made @xcite to supercool bulk liquid 2 , but the search for superfluidity ( in the bulk ) has so far not met with success .",
    "confinement , and reduction of dimensionality , are widely regarded as plausible avenues to the stabilization of a liquid phase of 2 at temperatures sufficiently low that a superfluid transition may be observed .",
    "indeed , computer simulations yielded evidence of superfluid behavior in very small ( less than 20 molecules ) _",
    "p_-h@xmath2 clusters,@xcite and claims have been made of its actual experimental observation .",
    "@xcite also , a considerable effort has been devoted , in recent times , to the theoretical characterization of superfluid properties of solvating 2 clusters around linear molecules , such as ocs .",
    "the study of hydrogen adsorption on nanocarbons falls within the same general research theme , but is also motivated by possible practical applications ; an important example is hydrogen storage , for fueling purposes .",
    "so far , research along these lines has mostly focused on nanotubes , @xcite but it seems worthwhile to extend the investigation , possibly providing useful quantitative information on adsorption on other nanostructures , including fullerenes .    in this work ,",
    "energetic and structural properties of a layer of 2 molecules adsorbed on a c@xmath6 fullerene are investigated theoretically , by means of ground state quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations . in order to provide a reasonable , quantitative account of the corrugation of the surface of the fullerene , we explicitly modeled in our study each individual carbon ( c ) atom . for comparison",
    ", however , we have also performed calculations with a simpler model , describing fullerenes as smooth spherical surfaces , interacting with 2 molecules via an angle - averaged potential .",
    "only one adsorbed layer is found to be thermodynamically stable on these small nanocarbons . on a corrugated substrate ,",
    "a commensurate solid layer is observed at equilibrium ; as the chemical potential is increased , a discontinuous change to an incommensurate solid layer takes place on c@xmath7 , c@xmath8 and c@xmath9 .",
    "we could not find , within the statistical uncertainties of our calculation , evidence of an incommensurate layer on c@xmath10 .",
    "the difference in compression between commensurate and incommensurate layers , as measured by the effective 2 coverage , is approximately 216% for c@xmath7 , and decreases to @xmath11 25% for c@xmath9 .",
    "obviously , on a smooth fullerene , there is no distinction between commensurate and incommensurate layers . in the absence of corrugation",
    ", energetics of the adsorbed layer are determined primarily by the interactions among 2 molecules .",
    "the ground state of 2 in two dimensions ( 2d ) is a solid , with molecules forming a triangular lattice.@xcite our results indicate that 2 molecules attempt to reproduce the same triangular arrangement as on an infinite plane , even when confined to moving on a spherical surface of radius as small as a few  .",
    "evidence of quantum exchange is absent in these systems , i.e. , no evidence suggesting possible superfluid behavior is gathered in this work .    the remainder of this manuscript is organized as follows : sec .",
    "[ model ] offers a description of the model used for our system of interest , including a discussion of the potentials used and the justifications for underlying assumptions .",
    "[ method ] involves a brief discussion of the computational technique and specific details of its implementation , in addition to details of calibration and optimization .",
    "the results are presented in sec .",
    "[ results ] ; finally , sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] is a summary of the findings and our concluding remarks .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath12 2 molecules , in the presence of a single c@xmath0 molecule .",
    "the latter is assumed fixed in space , owing to its relatively large mass ; the center of the molecule is taken as the origin of a cartesian coordinate frame .",
    "the @xmath1 individual c atoms are fixed at positions @xmath13 , @xmath14=1,2, ... ,@xmath1 .",
    "all of the atoms and molecules are regarded as point particles .",
    "the model quantum many - body hamiltonian is therefore the following : @xmath15 here , @xmath16 is the mass of a 2 molecule , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ( with @xmath19=1,2, ...",
    ",@xmath12 ) are the positions of the 2 molecules , @xmath20 is the potential describing the interaction between any two of them , and @xmath21 represents the interaction of a 2 molecule with a c atom .",
    "all pair potentials are assumed to depend only on relative distances .",
    "the interaction @xmath20 is described by the silvera - goldman potential @xcite , which provides an accurate description of energetic and structural properties of condensed 2 at ordinary conditions of temperature and pressure.@xcite the interaction of a 2 molecule and a c atom is modeled using a standard 6 - 12 lennard - jones ( lj ) potential , with @xmath22 k and @xmath23   ( see , for instance , ref . ) .",
    "the model ( [ hm ] ) already contains important physical simplifications , such as the neglect of zero - point motion of c atoms , as well as the restrictions to additive pairwise interactions ( to the exclusion of , for example , three - body terms ) , all taken to be central , and the use of the highly simplified lj interaction . on the other hand , ( [ hm ] ) is the simplest microscopic model that explicitly takes into account the corrugation of the surface of the buckyball .",
    "a further simplification can be introduced by replacing the third term in ( [ hm ] ) with @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the following , spherically symmetric external potential ( see ref . for details ) : @xmath26 \\nonumber \\\\       & - & \\frac{\\sigma^{6}}{2}\\left[\\frac{1}{(r-\\rm { r})^{4 } } -           \\frac{1}{(r+\\rm { r})^{4}}\\right]\\biggr\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath27 @xmath28 , @xmath29 being the of the fullerene and @xmath30 being the areal density of c atom on its surface ; @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the parameters of the lj potential @xmath20 introduced for the fully corrugated model . by using ( [ sim ] ) , one is describing the fullerene as a smooth spherical shell , i.e. , corrugation is neglected .",
    "this approximation substantially simplifies the calculation ; it has been adopted in recent studies of helium adsorption on buckyballs.@xcite as mentioned above , in this work we have performed calculations based on the full model ( [ hm ] ) , as well as using the effective potential ( [ sim ] ) ; results obtained in the two ways are compared in sec . [ results ] .",
    "accurate ground state expectation values for quantum many - body systems described by a hamiltonian such as ( [ hm ] ) can be computed by means of qmc simulations . in this work ,",
    "the method utilized is _ variational path integral _",
    "( vpi ) , which is an extension to zero temperature of the standard , path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) method .",
    "@xcite vpi ( also referred to as path integral ground state , pigs@xcite ) is a projection technique , which filters out the exact ground state wave function out of an initial trial state .",
    "it is therefore closely related to other ground state projection methods , such as diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) , but has a few distinct advantages ( for a discussion , see , for instance , ref . ) .",
    "the vpi technique works as follows : one samples a large set @xmath33 , @xmath34 of discretized many - particle paths @xmath35 , where @xmath36 represents the positions of all @xmath12 particles in the system at the @xmath19th  slice \" .",
    "these paths are sampled based on the probability density @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a trial wave function for the many - body system , and @xmath39 is a short - time ( i.e. , @xmath40 ) approximation to the imaginary - time propagator @xmath41 \\right|r'\\right\\rangle$ ] .",
    "one can show @xcite that , for any choice of @xmath42 , in the limits @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 is sampled from the square of the exact ground state wave function @xmath46 .",
    "this allows one to calculate the ground state expectation value of any observable @xmath47 diagonal in the coordinate representation as a simple statistical average @xmath48 the ground state energy can be evaluated using the convenient  mixed estimator \" , which yields an unbiased estimate : @xmath49 both expressions ( [ ave ] ) , ( [ ene ] ) can be rendered arbitrarily accurate by letting @xmath50 .",
    "the form of @xmath51 used here is the _ primitive approximation _",

    "since the projection time @xmath57 is necessarily finite , simulations must be performed for increasing @xmath58 , until one finds that estimates of the observables have converged , within statistical errors .",
    "one must also extrapolate estimates obtained for different @xmath56 , in order to infer results in the @xmath44 limit . a more accurate form of @xmath51 ( such as that thoroughly discussed in ref .",
    ", accurate to @xmath59 ) , or a more accurate trial wave function @xmath42 allows one to obtain convergence with larger @xmath56 and/or shorter @xmath58 , but , at least in principle , the extrapolated results ought to be independent of the choices of @xmath51 and @xmath60 .",
    "@xcite in summary , with sufficient computer time and proper calibration of @xmath56 and @xmath58 , one can generate estimates of physical observables that are _ exact _ ( errors being only statistical ) .",
    "individual simulations involve generating the set @xmath33 using a random walk through path space .",
    "the same path sampling techniques of pimc are adopted ; included are trial moves involving rigid displacements of an entire particle path ( _ displace _ type moves ) , and multilevel sampling updates ( see , for instance , ref . ) , which are divided into moves of central path portions ( i.e. , not including an endpoint , namely @xmath19=1 or @xmath19=2@xmath58 ) , and moves that update endpoint configurations ( which involve @xmath60 in the acceptance test , as do the _ displace _ moves ) .",
    "the trial wave function utilized is of the jastrow type : @xmath61    which fulfills the symmetry requirement of a many - boson wave function . in the case of the spherically averaged model , @xmath1=1 and @xmath62=0 .",
    "the pseudo - potentials @xmath63 and @xmath64 were chosen as follows : @xmath65 where @xmath66 for the spherically averaged potential , and @xmath67 for the corrugated case .",
    "the values of the parameters @xmath68 @xmath69 , @xmath70 @xmath71 and @xmath72 were obtained empirically , by minimizing the energy expectation value computed in separate variational calculations .    using the given @xmath42 , we observe convergence of the ground state energy estimates with a projection time @xmath73 = 0.250 k@xmath74 , with @xmath75 k@xmath74 . estimates for all quantities quoted in this study",
    "were obtained using @xmath76 , even though convergence of the estimates for structural quantities can be typically observed with values of @xmath56 significantly greater than @xmath77 ( for an equal projection time ) .",
    "vpi calculations for a range of 2 coverages were carried out for each of c@xmath7 , c@xmath8 , c@xmath9 , and c@xmath10 ( we refer here to the near spherical isomers of each ) .",
    "we use an initial configuration of para - hydrogen molecules surrounding the fullerene at a distance of approximately twice the c@xmath0 radius ( i.e. , making sure that no 2 start off within the buckyball ) . because of the strongly attractive character of the c@xmath0 , for a small enough number of surrounding hydrogen molecules the system remains spatially confined ( i.e. , 2 molecules do not evaporate ) .",
    "thus , even though periodic boundary conditions are used in the simulation , they have no effect , so long as a sufficiently large simulation cell is used .",
    "the systematic errors of our calculation are attributable to the finite projection time @xmath73 and the finite time step @xmath56 .",
    "based on comparisons of results obtained from simulations with different values of @xmath58 and @xmath56 , we estimate our combined systematic error on the total energy per 2 molecule to be of the order of 0.6 k or less .",
    "physical quantities of interest include the ground state energy per 2 molecule @xmath78 and the radial 2 density @xmath79 about the fullerene , as a function of the total number @xmath12 of molecules .",

    ", height=211 ]    there are some qualitative similarities , but also important differences ( mainly at low @xmath12 ) between the results yielded by the two models utilized .",
    "firstly , in the large-@xmath12 limit they yield essentially the same energy estimates , as corrugation becomes unimportant for thick adsorbed films .",
    "this is the case on all fullerenes .",
    "both @xmath78 curves display a single minimum at a specific number @xmath87 of 2 molecules .",
    "the minimum corresponds to the mathematical condition @xmath88 , and physically to the formation of a stable 2 layer . on the corrugated c@xmath7",
    ", a stable layer occurs for a number @xmath89 , significantly smaller than that ( @xmath90 ) obtained on a smooth fullerene .",
    "moreover , the energy per molecule @xmath91 for the corrugated model , is approximately 10% lower than that on a smooth substrate ( @xmath92 ) , i.e. , the corrugated model yields stronger 2 binding .",
    "qualitatively similar results are observed on all fullerenes ; however , the difference between @xmath93 and @xmath94 is seen to decrease with the radius of the fullerene , whereas the difference between the minimum energy values in the two models is @xmath11 10% for all fullerenes .",
    "corrugation introduces the conceptual distinction between a layer that is _ commensurate _ with the substrate ( i.e. , the outer surface of the fullerene ) , and one that is _ incommensurate _ with it . in a commensurate layer ,",
    "each 2 molecule sits right on top of the center of one of the hexagonal ( or , pentagonal ) faces of the polyhedron formed by c atoms .",
    "for example , c@xmath7 has the shape of a dodecahedron , i.e. it has 12 pentagonal faces , corresponding to as many adsorption sites for 2 molecules . in an incommensurate layer , on the other hand , the arrangement of 2 molecules is mostly determined by their mutual interactions ; the fullerene , in this case , merely provides a background attractive potential and a curved geometry .    , but for a c@xmath10 fullerene.,height=211 ]    on all fullerenes studied here , using the corrugated model , the equilibrium adsorbed 2 layer is found to be commensurate . on a corrugated substrate",
    ", one normally sees a transition from a commensurate to an incommensurate layer , as the chemical potential is increased from its equilibrium value.@xcite no such transition can be observed on a smooth substrate , for which commensuration is undefined .",
    "this is indeed what we _ generally _ observe on the various fullerenes that we have considered .",
    "details , however , differ for the different systems .",
    "on c@xmath7 , the number of adsorbed 2 molecules remains constant as the chemical potential is increased ( i.e. , no compression of the commensurate layer is observed ) , until it jumps discontinuously from @xmath95 to @xmath96 ( see fig .",
    "[ energyplot1 ] ) .",
    "this signals the ( abrupt ) appearance of an incommensurate layer .",
    "the number @xmath97 of molecules in such an incommensurate layer is the same as in the equilibrium layer on a smooth c@xmath7 ; this leads us to surmise that the physics of the incommensurate layer on the corrugated fullerene and that of the equilibrium layer on the smooth fullerene are essentially the same .",
    "thus , the main effect of the neglect of corrugation associated with the spherically averaged potential model , is the absence of the commensurate layer . we come back to this point later , when discussing density profiles .",
    "the incommensurate layer that forms on a c@xmath7 fullerene is compressible , i.e. , the number of adsorbed molecules is seen to increase monotonically with @xmath80 , up to @xmath98 ; no second layer formation is seen before @xmath80 reaches the value ( @xmath99 ) corresponding bulk 2 , above which thicker adsorbed films are thermodynamically unstable .",
    "in fact , on none of the fullerenes considered here , do we find more than one stable adsorbed layer .",
    "on c@xmath8 , our results indicate that the commensurate layer is compressible ; here too , however , a discontinuous transition occurs to an incommensurate layer , also compressible and again physically similar to the one that forms on a smooth fullerene .",
    "the same physical behavior to that observed on c@xmath7 is seen on c@xmath9 and c@xmath10 , with an incompressible commensurate layer .",
    "on c@xmath10 , though , we fail to observe an incommensurate layer ; it should also be noticed that , on this system , it is @xmath100 and @xmath101 , i.e. , there is a much smaller relative difference between @xmath93 and @xmath94 than on the other fullerenes .     &",

    "no evidence is seen of second layer formation , on any of the fullerenes studied here , for values of the chemical potential for which the adsorbed film is thermodynamically stable ( i.e. , @xmath108 ) .    on comparing the density profile for the incommensurate layer on a corrugated fullerene ( dashed lines ) with that for a smooth fullerene ( solid lines )",
    ", one observes a further shift to the right for the case of a spherically averaged potential .",
    "perhaps more interestingly , the incommensurate layer on a corrugated fullerene features a greater spatial width , with respect to that on a smooth fullerene ( particularly on c@xmath7 and c@xmath8 ) .",
    "otherwise , these layers seem physically similar ; for example , one can compute an effective 2d density @xmath109 ( different than the coverage @xmath30 discussed above ) defined as @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the position of the peak of @xmath79 .",
    "the values obtained for the two layers are very close . in the case of a smooth fullerene ,",
    "as one goes from c@xmath7 to c@xmath10 , @xmath109 approaches from below the value 0.067 2 , namely the equilibrium density of 2 in 2d.@xcite this suggests that the physics of the incommensurate layer ( and that on a smooth fullerene ) is determined primarily by the interaction among 2 molecules , which attempt to replicate , on a curved surface , the same arrangement as in 2d .",
    "one further thing to note is that the width of the adsorbed 2 layer on these systems is of the order of 1  , very close to that of an adsorbed monolayer film on graphite.@xcite    the computational method adopted here does not allow one to make a direct estimation of the 2 molecule exchange frequency , unlike its finite temperature counterpart ( path integral monte carlo ) .",
    "nevertheless , from visual inspection of many - particle configurations generated in the monte carlo simulation , we observe little or no overlap of paths associated to different molecules , which is substantial evidence that many - particle permutations are absent in this system .",
    "this is consistent with the high degree of localization that molecules experience , both in the commensurate and in the incommensurate adsorbed layers .",
    "using a numerically exact ground state quantum monte carlo method , we studied 2 adsorption on the outer surface of near - spherical fullerenes .",
    "we performed calculations based on a simple model , in which all carbon atoms are included explicitly , i.e. , corrugation of the surface of the fullerene is captured .",
    "a single solid layer of 2 is found to be thermodynamically stable on the fullerenes studied in this work .",
    "we find that the equilibrium adsorbed layer is commensurate with the corrugated surface of the fullerene .",
    "such a layer is found to be compressible on one of the fullerenes ( namely , c@xmath8 ) , incompressible on the others . on increasing the chemical potential ,",
    "a discontinuous transition is observed to an incommensurate layer on all fullerenes , except for the largest one considered here ( c@xmath10 ) .",
    "the basic physics of the incommensurate layer is driven primarily by the interaction among 2 molecules , which attempt to reproduce the same triangular arrangement as on an infinite plane , even when confined to moving on a spherical surface of radius as small as a few  .",
    "indeed , the incommensurate layer is very similar to that found using a simpler model of the system , describing the fullerene as a smooth spherical substrate .",
    "this simpler model yields results for the energetics and structure of the incommensurate layer in good quantitative agreement with those provided by the fully corrugated model ; obviously , however , it is necessary to include corrugation in order to reproduce the commensurate layer .",
    "an interesting question that arises is whether a commensurate layer of helium may exist on these molecules ; the theoretical studies performed so far have made use of a spherically averaged potential to describe the fullerenes.@xcite    no evidence of quantum exchanges among 2 molecules has been observed in this work .",
    "thus , these systems do not appear as not likely candidates for the observation of the elusive superfluid phase of _ para_-hydrogen .    in conclusion",
    ", this study has provided preliminary information on the structure and energetics of hydrogen films adsorbed to the exterior of buckyballs , though much remains to be answered .",
