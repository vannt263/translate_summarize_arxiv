    "solar activity can be seen through the evolution of sunspots number in quasi - periodic oscillatory series with periods going from 8 to 15 years and with a mean period of 11  years . due to the change of magnetic field polarity in solar hemispheres alternatively",
    "each cycle , the period is rather 22 years .",
    "the quasi - periodic evolution of many activity phenomena is still a unsolved key problem in solar physics ( along with , e.g. , heating of the solar chromosphere and corona , and solar flares ) .",
    "an important issue of this understanding is due to the influence of solar activity over the terrestrial climate ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* archibald 2006 ) ) .",
    "many physical models were proposed to understand the basic mechanisms ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* benevolenskaya 1998 ) ) producing solar / stellar activity and its quasi - cyclic evolution . from sunspots time series , mathematical approaches have highlighted several other hidden periods other that the well - apparent 11-years period .",
    "these works contributed to provide some observed parameters to constraint theoretical models , and to predict the future evolution of the sunspots number ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* clilverd  2003 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sello 2003 ) ) . in this work",
    "we follow another mathematical approach , investigating the influence of the past evolution of the sunspots number over the present one .",
    "a natural and simple way to carry out this analysis is to assume that the susnpots number have a temporal delay behaviour .",
    "thus , the relationship between present and past values becomes non - linear and could prove that the past amplitude influence the present one . as for the abovementioned methods , this one also allows some predictions about future solar cycles by using intermediate parameters to characterize the general past evolution .",
    "we consider a temporal delay behavior ( eq .  [ eq1 ] ) to rely the present evolution of a phenomena with some particular events in its past evolution .",
    "the variation of @xmath0 in time is not only related with its current value @xmath1 but also with its past values @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is our temporal delay .",
    "the simplest way is to assume only one past temporal influence and some proportionality between the variables ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* murray 1993 ) ) , as follows :    @xmath4    because we use yearly values of the relative sunspots number , given by sdic ( http:// www.sidc.be/sunspot-data/ ) , @xmath5 is equal to @xmath6 .",
    "the present and past values of @xmath0 are already known and we assumed some values for the parameter @xmath3 ( @xmath7 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : ratiofactor ] , left panel ) .",
    "so we can determine constants @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( eq .  [ eq2 ] ) from the correlation between the sunspots number ratio and the past sunspots number ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ratiofactor ] right panel ) .",
    "the @xmath3 values which minimize the correlation between the sunspots number ratio and the past spots number , are 7 or 8 years ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ratiofactor ] ) . to test the accuracy of our method",
    ", we applied it on the solar cycle  23 ( table  [ tab : cycle23 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : evolspots ] , left panel ) .",
    "our predictions are consistent with the observations , except for the unusually long period of low activity at the end of this cycle .",
    "we also characterized the next solar cycle  @xmath11 ( table  [ tab : prediction ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : evolspots ] ) using our modelling of the solar cycle  @xmath12 as well as the spots number observed until @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the next maximum sunspots number would take place between @xmath15 and @xmath16 and should be close to 60 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : evolspots ] , right panel ) as for the solar cycle  @xmath17 . using",
    "the solar minimum occurred in @xmath18 ( @xmath19 from sdic ) , the predicted maximum is consistent with the value from the linear least - square fit on the both axis ( red line on fig .",
    "[ fig : rminrmax ] ) and is a few smaller than the range given by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* brajsa  ( 2009 ) ) .",
    "moreover the next solar minimum should not occur before 2019 or even 2020 .",

    "* ( hathaway & wilson 2006 ) ) linked probably with magnetic activity by some kind of histeresis mechanism . at present , we can successfully reproduce some previous solar cycles ( e.g. , epoch and solar maximum ) .",
    "we plan to improve our predictive method including the influence of delays for which there is a good correlation .",
    "this more detailed description could allow to solve the overestimation of the next solar minimum and to reproduce the asymmetries observed during the previous cycles .",
    "our final aim is to obtain a reliable prediction of the whole solar activity by identifying the fundamental lower and high activity precursors of its present and future evolution .",
    "all these improvements are still needed to be able to predict future low solar activity periods ( e.g. , maunder / dalton minimum ) ."
