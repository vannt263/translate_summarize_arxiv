    "clusters of galaxies , the largest virialized structures in the universe , play a critical role in understanding the formation and evolution of large scale structure , and determining fundamental cosmological parameters .",
    "it is now well - known that the dark matter , the dominant component , makes up about 80% of the total gravitational mass of a typical galaxy cluster .",
    "the baryonic matter in galaxies accounts for about 3  5% of the total mass .",
    "the remaining mass is made up by hot gas distributed between galaxies , with temperatures over @xmath6 k. this hot gas , called the `` intracluster medium '' ( icm ) , emits x - rays through thermal bremsstrahlung radiation , and makes galaxy clusters the second most luminous x - ray sources in the universe , after quasars . in the era of precision cosmology , it becomes imperative to measure accurately cluster properties , such as its gravitational mass , to a precision of a few percent .",
    "the x - ray measurement of the density and temperature profiles of the hot icm provides one of the most accurate methods to determine the cluster total gravitational mass . for clusters that have not been disturbed recently by a major merger",
    ", the hot icm should obey hydrostatic equilibrium to a good approximation , representing a balance between the gravitational force and thermal gas pressure .",
    "for the special case of spherical symmetry the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium may be written , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the gas density , @xmath9 is the thermal gas pressure , and @xmath10 is the mass enclosed within radius @xmath11 .",
    "applications of the x - ray method to constrain cosmological parameters include , e.g. , measurements of the gas mass fraction ( allen et al .",
    "2007 , and references therein ) , virial mass function ( e.g. , stanek et al .  2006 , and references therein ) and the relationship between the virial concentration and mass ( buote et al .  2007 ) .",
    "it is necessary to use cosmological hydrodynamical n - body simulations to test the key assumptions underlying equation [ [ eqn.he ] ] ; i.e. , spherical symmetry and negligible non - thermal pressure support of the hot icm ( e.g. , evrard et al .",

    "early studies showed that it is possible to recover the cluster mass within a factor of @xmath12 with x - ray telescopes such as _ einstein _ and _ exosat _",
    "( e.g. , tsai et al .",
    "1994 ) , where isothermal gas had to be assumed in the mock x - ray analysis .",
    "most recent studies , which involve mock observations with the most advanced telescopes such as _ chandra _ , allow the radial gas temperature profile to be measured , and use simulations that include a wider range of physical processes .",
    "they find that the global cluster mass , typically computed within a radius of fixed over - density ( e.g. , @xmath5 ) , can be recovered more accurately , with systematic errors typically ranging from 5% to 20% ( see , e.g. , nagai et al .",
    "2007 ) .            over the past decade simulators have emphasized how much additional pressure support from random turbulent gas motion contributes to systematic errors in the x - ray method ( e.g. , bryan & norman  1998 ; kay et al .",

    "it has also been noticed in such high - resolution , hydrodynamic simulations that while the velocity dispersion tensor of the icm is approximately isotropic in the outskirts of clusters , it becomes increasingly tangential at smaller radii , especially for the most relaxed systems ( rasia , tormen , & moscardini 2004 ; lau et al .",
    "2008 , in preparation ) ; recently lau et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have shown the icm velocity dispersion becomes increasingly tangentially anisotropic as one moves inward from @xmath5 , such that for their relaxed clusters the anisotropy parameter falls to @xmath13 near @xmath14 .",
    "these authors consider the non - thermal pressure support of this random turbulent motion ( both radial and tangential ) on estimates of @xmath15 assuming hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "however , rotational support of the gas , and its observable signatures , is not addressed .    in this paper , we show that for the relaxed clusters studied by lau et al .",
    "( 2008 ; nagai et al .",
    "2007 ) support of the icm from rotational and streaming motions is comparable to the support from the random turbulent pressure out to @xmath16 . while the overall magnitude of the rotational motion ( @xmath17 a few hundred @xmath18 ) is not large enough to be detected directly through doppler shifts of emission lines in x - ray spectra , even with the most advanced x - ray telescopes we have today ( e.g. , sunyaev et al .  2003 ; inogamov & sunyaev  2003 ; schuecker et al .",

    "have a distinctly different radial variation in ellipticity .",
    "this demonstrates the utility of x - ray ellipticity profiles as a constraint for future cosmological cluster simulations .",

    "the last section is devoted to summary and discussion .",
    "we use a set of 16 high - resolution , cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of cluster - sized systems in a flat @xmath19 model : @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( the power spectrum normalization at 8@xmath22 mpc scale ) .",
    "these cluster - sized simulations include collisionless dynamics of dark matter , star and intracluster gas .",
    "they also include several critical physical processes such as radiative cooling , star formation and metal enrichment ( csf simulation ) . for comparison",
    "we also analyze one adiabatic cluster simulation , i.e. , no radiative cooling and star formation ( nc simulation ) .",

    "2007 ) , and run in two computational boxes : @xmath25 mpc for cl101107 , and @xmath26 mpc for the rest .",
    "the art is a shock - capturing code that is particularly suited for capturing shocks and turbulent motion , and the use of adaptive mesh refinement also allows us to resolve the detailed cluster structure and the internal gas flows in clusters .",
    "these simulations achieve a dynamic range of @xmath27 @xmath28 , and a peak resolution of @xmath29 kpc , which is well - matched to the spatial resolution of chandra x - ray observations of nearby galaxy clusters .",

    "2007 shows the typical properties of simulated clusters , all the parameters are computed from simulations within a region with an over - density of 500 , with respect to the critical density of the universe .",
    "these clusters have masses ranging between @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and temperatures between 1 kev and 8.7 kev .",
    "the simulated clusters are projected along three orthogonal directions @xmath32 , and x - ray flux maps are created for each projection .",
    "( these coordinate axes reflect the orientation of the entire simulation box and are not adjusted to match the principle axes of each cluster . )",
    "we make the mock _ chandra _ images by convolving the emission spectrum with the response of the _ chandra _ front - illuminated ccds and with an exposure of 100 @xmath33 , a typical exposure for _ chandra _ observations .",
    "we show the images and velocity structures of a relaxed cluster ( cl7 ) in figure  [ image ] and a disturbed cluster ( cl11 ) in figure  [ image11 ] .",
    "cl7 is judged to be the most relaxed cluster in the simulation sample , with a gravitational mass of @xmath34 and a size of @xmath35 kpc . here",
    "@xmath5 is defined as a radius of 500 times the mean density of the universe , @xmath15 is the total gravitational mass within @xmath5 . in contrast",
    ", cl11 is a very disturbed system with @xmath36 and @xmath37 kpc .",

    "the box size of the image is @xmath39 mpc .",
    "the cluster has a very regular appearance in all projections .",
    "however , the x - ray isophotes display significant elongation in the @xmath40 and @xmath41 projections compared to the much rounder isophotes of the @xmath42 projection .",
    "the bottom panel of the figure  [ image ] shows the two dimensional velocity field in the central slices of the simulated cluster cl7 .",
    "the left plot is along the @xmath43 plane , the middle plot is along the @xmath44 plane , and the right is the @xmath45 plane .",
    "the velocity vector is color - coded between 0 and 500 @xmath46 , with the magnitude showing in the bottom color bar .",
    "the most striking feature is that while in both @xmath44 and @xmath45 planes the gas is moving largely randomly , in @xmath43 plane the gas shows a very regular , counterclockwise , rotational motion with velocities between @xmath47 .",
    "in contrast , cl11 is a merging cluster with violent gas motion ( figure  [ image11 ] ) .",
    "merging in the central region creates large scale gas motions on the order of 1,000 @xmath48 .",
    "such merging activity is clearly visible in the velocity fields shown in the @xmath43 plane and @xmath44 plane : gas is moving from the north - west and south - east directions toward the center .",
    "the x - ray images in the three projections are also distorted . unlike cl7 ordered rotational motion",
    "is unimportant in all projections .    in the following subsections we compare the contribution of rotation ( and other streaming motion ) to that of random turbulent motion in supporting the weight of the icm of the simulated clusters .",
    "the total cluster mass @xmath49 enclosed within a surface @xmath50 is given by gauss s law , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the gravitational potential and @xmath53 is the gravitational constant .",
    "assuming the icm is a steady state , inviscid , collisional fluid we may use euler s equation to eliminate @xmath52 in favor of the gas pressure and terms involving the velocity components of the icm , @xmath54 \\cdot d^2 \\mathbf{s},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the gas density and @xmath9 represents the pressure arising from gas motions having a random ( i.e. , maxwellian ) velocity distribution .",
    "we rewrite the previous equation as a sum of four terms , @xmath55 the first two terms on the r.h.s .",

    "@xmath57 is the thermal gas pressure , where @xmath58 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath59 is temperature , @xmath60 is the proton mass , and @xmath61 is the atomic weight . the quantity @xmath62 is the pressure from random turbulent motions .",
    "the last two terms on the r.h.s .",
    ", @xmath63 follow by evaluating @xmath64 in spherical coordinates ( binney & tremaine  1987 ) . here",
    "@xmath65 is the contribution from rotational motion while @xmath66 includes the contributions from other streaming motion .",
    "the combination @xmath67 represents the total contribution to the gravitational support from non - random gas motions . in this paper",
    "we are especially concerned with assessing the relative importance of non - random gas motions to that of the random turbulent motion .",
    "however , we also find it useful to separate the non - random contribution into the terms @xmath65 and @xmath66 . for a cluster supported mostly by rotation @xmath65 will dominate @xmath66 . for a non - rotating cluster with substantial non - random motions ,",
    "@xmath65 and @xmath66 will be of similar magnitude ( but will not necessarily cancel ) .",
    "hence , in our discussion below we always consider the total @xmath67 when assessing the relevance of non - random gas motions , but we use @xmath65 ( @xmath68 ) as a rotation proxy particularly for the relaxed clusters .    in",
    "what follows we choose the surface @xmath50 to be that of a sphere , but we emphasize that we do not assume the cluster is spherical and use the full three - dimensional icm properties produced by the simulation to evaluate the integrals .",
    "furthermore , we do not explicitly calculate @xmath69 since it depends critically on the sizes , velocities , temperatures , and densities of the coherent clumps that move randomly within the icm .",
    "instead , we infer its magnitude from @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the total `` true '' mass of the gas and dark matter computed directly from the particles in the simulation .    to compute the mass profile associated with both the `` true '' mass and the mass components based on eq.[47 ] , we make use of the grid data that is generated from the raw data of the adaptive mesh refinement simulation .",
    "specifically , the raw data is interpolated onto to a uniform @xmath72 cube grid in a @xmath73 mpc@xmath74 box , centered on the simulated cluster .",
    "the spatial resolution therefore is 7.8@xmath22 kpc .",
    "we divide the simulation box into a number of radial bins , and compute each mass component . at each radial bin",
    ", the entire surface is divided into small cells along @xmath75 and @xmath76 directions , over which the integration is performed .",
    "specifically , in each cell we throw test particles randomly , we then compute the mean density , thermal pressure , and velocity by averaging all the test particles . again , since we use gauss s law and compute the integration in three dimensions , our analysis is entirely general with regard to the cluster geometry .          in the left panel of figure  [ m7 ]",
    "we show the `` true '' mass profile of the relaxed cluster cl7 obtained by directly counting the dark matter and mass particles from the simulation .",
    "also displayed are various combinations of @xmath77 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , that result from substituting euler s equation into gauss s law as discussed in the previous section .",
    "we consider seriously the gas properties of the simulated clusters down to a radius of @xmath78 . below this radius",
    "the well - known effect of over - cooling produces unphysical gas density and temperature profiles .    over",
    "most of the cluster region displayed , @xmath77 systematically underestimates the `` true '' mass by 5%-10% .",
    "rotational and other streaming motions provide most of the non - thermal support of the cluster weight over a large range of radii .",
    "the combination of @xmath79 ( green solid line in the figure  [ m7 ] ) is within a few percent of the `` true '' mass out to @xmath80 . for these radii , @xmath81 ( see right panel of figure  [ m7 ] ) , indicating that rotation is the most important streaming motion , consistent with the visual impression of the velocity field shown in figure [ image ] .",
    "we provide a direct comparison of rotation and streaming motions to random turbulent motions in figure [ v7 ] .",
    "( note we take the absolute value of @xmath69 since it fluctuates about zero when its magnitude is small . ) over approximately @xmath82 , @xmath83 generally dominates @xmath69 and remains comparable to @xmath69 all the way out to @xmath84 .",
    "since , as noted above , @xmath81 within @xmath80 , it follows that @xmath65 dominates the non - thermal support of the cluster weight in that region .",
    "in contrast , for the disturbed cluster cl11 @xmath85 over all radii shown ( figures [ m7 ] and [ v7 ] ) .",
    "rotational motion does not dominate , consistent with the lack of circular motion noted from visual inspection of the velocity field shown in figure [ image11 ] . despite the differences between cl7 and cl11 , it is interesting to note that for cl11 @xmath77 typically lies within @xmath86 of the `` true '' mass .",
    "this is of similar magnitude to cl7 , except that cl7 only underestimates the `` true '' mass .",
    "the basic results for cl7 and cl11 apply generally to the other relaxed and disturbed clusters in the simulation . in particular , we show in the right panel of figure [ v7 ] the relative contribution of rotation and other streaming motion to the turbulent motion by averaging the results for all of the relaxed clusters ( solid black line ) and all of the disturbed clusters ( dashed red line ) in the simulation .",
    "( we have used the same clusters designated as `` relaxed '' or `` disturbed '' as nagai et al .",
    "2007 ) . while there is substantial scatter ( not shown ) about these average profiles , particularly for the disturbed systems",
    ", @xmath83 generally dominates @xmath69 over approximately @xmath82 and remains comparable to @xmath69 all the way out to @xmath87 . in the disturbed clusters , @xmath69 exceeds the rotational and streaming terms over most of the region within @xmath5 .",
    "we also analyze a simulation that starts from the same initial conditions as those adopted in cl7 .",
    "however , in this simulation , the icm of the cluster  called `` cl7a ''  evolves adiabatically , i.e. , without radiative cooling .",
    "the major difference between these two sets of simulations is that the csf clusters suffer the so - called `` over - cooling '' problem ( e.g. , balogh et al .",
    "2001 ) : cooling can produce a substantial amount of cold gas that is likely a few times higher than what are observed in real clusters ( gnedin et al .  2004 ) .    in the left panel of figure  [ cl7a ]",
    "we plot mass profiles for various terms in cl7a , applying the same method that we used for cl7 . for this simulation",
    "unfortunately part of the temperature data is corrupted , and we have only those within @xmath88 mpc box and compute the mass profiles out to @xmath89 .",
    "clearly , for the simulation without radiative cooling , @xmath77 closely follows the total mass , and the contribution from @xmath90 is less than 5% over most radii .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the case of cl7 , in which the contribution from the @xmath90 can be up to 10  20% , especially in the inner regions ( see left panel of figure  [ m7 ] ) .",
    "this suggests that rotation and streaming motion contribute less to the gas dynamics in the nc simulations ; i.e. , that without radiative cooling .    to illustrate the different between the csf and nc simulations",
    ", we also plot the rotational velocities in the cl7 and cl7a .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ cl7a ] shows the rotational velocity as a function of radius .",
    "we take the equatorial plane and average the gas velocity projection in the plane in each radial bin .",
    "we notice that both nc and csf simulations show similar gas velocities at @xmath91 , between 200 and 300 @xmath46 .",
    "however , at the inner regions , the gas volocity in the csf simulation rises sharply to above 1000 @xmath46 , while the nc simulation shows a steady decline .",
    "the substantial gas rotation has a strong impact on the gas dynamics in the central regions .",
    "this can be quantified by the ratio ( @xmath92 ) between the kenetic energy in rotation ( @xmath93 ) and the thermal energy ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "for the csf cluster cl7 , we have @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the rotation velocity . taking the typical rotational velocity of @xmath97 at @xmath98 in cl7 ( see figure  [ cl7a ] )",
    ", we estimate the rotational kinetic energy can be as high as about 23% of the thermal energy .",
    "this is actually a conservative lower limit since the gas temperature peaks at @xmath99 kev ( nagai et al .",
    ". it can be as low as @xmath100 kev in the innermost regions .",
    "this ratio decreases to about 10% between 0.2 and 0.3 @xmath5 .",
    "however , for cl7a , due to the relative low velocity , this ratio stays below 10% at most radii.in fact , in the adiabatic simulation the @xmath101 value at @xmath102 is only about @xmath103 the value obtained for the simulation with cooling and star formation .",
    "the substantial icm rotation predicted by the simulations for relaxed cdm clusters needs to be tested by observations .",
    "the straightforward approach to detect rotation and other bulk motion of the icm in clusters is to measure doppler shifts and broadening of emission lines in their x - ray spectra . for a typical bulk - motion velocity of @xmath104 , sunyaev ,",
    "norman & bryan  ( 2003 ) estimated that the doppler shift of an iron line at 6.7 kev would be @xmath105 ev . the x - ray spectrometer ( xrs ) on astro - e2 would have been the first instrument to perform such measurements for many clusters .",
    "but its failure soon after launch means we must await the next generation of x - ray satellites , such as _ constellation - x _ , _ xeus _ and _ spectrum - x _ , for direct measurements of icm motions in many clusters .        in the classic cooling flow model , gas rotation",
    "is expected near the center of the flow due to mass and angular momentum conservation ( e.g. , mathews & brighenti  2003 ) . in the case of elliptical galaxies ,",
    "the x - ray images are expected to be considerably flattened toward the equatorial plane ( e.g. , brighenti & mathews  1996 ; mathews & brighenti  2003 ) .",
    "x - ray morphological information , such as ellipticity , can be used to probe this process then .",
    "x - ray studies that assume negligible icm rotation indicate that both the radial profile ( e.g. , pratt & arnaud 2003 ; lewis , buote , & stocke 2003 ; vikhlinin et al.2006 ; gastaldello et al .",
    "2007 ) and ellipticity ( buote & canizares 1996 ) of the gravitating mass of nearby clusters agree with the radial profile and ellipticity of the dark matter of simulated cdm clusters . therefore ,",
    "if the icm of the simulated cdm clusters in our study is flattened substantially by rotation , their x - ray images on average should have larger ellipticities than observed clusters .",
    "since x - ray ellipticity can be measured precisely for many clusters , below we compare results for the simulated cdm clusters to a sample of observed clusters .",
    "we will also compare to a simulated cdm clusters that involves no radiative cooling and star formation .",
    "this comparison will help us understand the role of over - cooling .",
    "we note that previous studies found that the simulation we use here reproduces reasonably well the spherically averaged global icm properties of observed clusters ( nagai et al .  2007 ;",
    "kravtsov et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "we begin by computing the ellipticity profiles of the x - ray images of the relaxed simulated cluster cl7 for the three orthogonal projections shown in figure [ image ] .",
    "the iterative moment - based procedure we use to evaluate the ellipticities of the simulated x - ray images is the same as that discussed below for the observations of real clusters (  [ obsell ] ) .",
    "we show the x - ray ellipticity profiles for cl7 in figure [ ell ] .",
    "the x - ray ellipticities of the @xmath42-projection are small and have a nearly constant value ( @xmath106 ) from @xmath107 eventually falling to ( @xmath108 ) at @xmath5 .",
    "the very round x - ray isophotes are expected in this projection since one is essentially looking down the axis of rotation .",
    "in contrast , the ellipticities are much larger and show a much stronger variation with radius in the other two projections .",
    "for the @xmath40-projection , the ellipticity is @xmath109 between radii @xmath110 , declines to @xmath111 at @xmath112 , and continues to fall with radius until reaching a value of @xmath113 at @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath41-projection has ellipticities similar to the @xmath40-projection but with @xmath114 smaller values for most radii .",
    "the x - ray ellipticities for radii @xmath115 in the @xmath40 and @xmath41 projections are considerably larger than those of the dark matter ( @xmath116 ) , which also decline with increasing radius .",
    "the larger x - ray ellipticities with respect to the dark matter imply substantial rotational flattening of icm , because ( 1 ) the gravitational potential of an ellipsoid is never flatter than the mass distribution that generates it , ( 2 ) for ( non - rotating ) single - phase hot gas in hydrostatic equilibrium , the x - ray emissivity has the same shape as the gravitational potential , independent of the temperature profile of the gas ( `` x - ray shape theorem '' , buote & canizares 1994 , 1998 ) , and ( 3 ) @xmath65 dominates @xmath66 and @xmath69 .    as a consistency check , we note that at 0.1 @xmath5 both @xmath117 and @xmath101 ( section 2.4 ) are about 0.25 for cl7 , indicating substantial rotational support .",
    "moreover , @xmath118 provides an approximate indication of the axial ratio induced by rotation , and this can explain most of the excess x - ray ellipticity over that produced by the flattened dark matter potential .    to make a proper comparison of the x - ray ellipticity profile of the simulated cdm clusters to the average ellipticity profile of observed clusters we average the ellipticity profiles of cl7 obtained by viewing 100 projections of random orientation @xmath119 .",
    "the average ellipticity profile is calculated by averaging all the ellipticity values of a particular radius obtained for the 100 simulations . to achieve fast computation , we approximate the x - ray emissivity in each cell as @xmath120 , appropriate for thermal bremsstrahlung radiation .",
    "we verified this approximation by comparing to the profiles for the three orthogonal projections projections computed using the full expression for the plasma emissivity .",
    "the angle - averaged x - ray ellipticity profile for cl7 is shown in figure [ ell ] .",
    "the average profile is similar to that from the @xmath40 and @xmath41 projections but with somewhat smaller values ; i.e. , the ellipticity declines from @xmath121 at @xmath122 to @xmath123 at @xmath112 and then settles to a value between 0.15 - 0.20 at larger radii .    using the same procedure , we computed average ellipticity profiles for the other `` relaxed '' clusters in the simulation . since below we consider observations of clusters ( rather than lower mass groups )",
    ", we only include the relaxed simulated clusters with masses above @xmath124 ; i.e. , cl3 , cl5 , cl7 , and cl104 .",
    "we angle - averaged the profiles of these systems and plot the combined average profile of these four systems in figure  [ rosat ] .",
    "the combined profile is very similar to that of cl7 ( figure [ ell ] ) .      for comparison , in figure[ell ]",
    "( dark dashed line ) we show the average ellipticity profile of cl7a obtained from the simulation without cooling or star formation ( nc ) . since we do nt have the temperature data outside of the @xmath88 mpc box and the x - ray emissivity has a very weak dependency on temperature , we approximate the x - ray emissivity in each cell as @xmath125 .",
    "we test our results within the @xmath88 mpc box and do not find any major difference between these two approximations . within the central regions",
    "@xmath126 the ellipticity of the nc cluster is considerably smaller compared to the csf simulation . in fact , the ellipticity profile remains nearly constant with a value @xmath127 for radii larger than @xmath128 .",
    "the much smaller ellipticity in cl7a is consistent with the much smaller rotational support compared to cl7 .",

    "the gas velocities of cl7 and cl7a are similar , as are their average x - ray ellipticities .",

    "its modest spatial resolution ( 0.5  fwhm at 1  kev ; corresponding to @xmath1750  kpc at @xmath1310.1 ) of the pspc will not significantly bias the ellipticity calculation within radii 100200  kpc . in contrast",
    "s excellent spatial resolution ( @xmath170.5 , corresponding to scales of 2  kpc even at redshifts as high as @xmath170.2 ) , but modest field of view ( 4  radius on any single ccd ) allows ellipticities to be measured from scales ranging from @xmath171 to @xmath17100  kpc .",
    "we did not use the  hri due to its smaller field of view and lower sensitivity than the pspc .    to define a sample of relaxed clusters we selected the 10 clusters from the pspc sample of buote & tsai  ( 1996 ) which had the lowest @xmath132  ratio within an aperture of 500@xmath133  kpc .",
    "we adopted the @xmath132  ratio since it is sensitive to unequal - sized mergers ( buote & tsai  1995 ) , and therefore allows us to eliminate obviously disturbed objects .",
    "although there is evidence of correlations between @xmath132   and @xmath134  ( which is sensitive to the cluster ellipticity ) _ for disturbed systems _ ( buote & tsai  1996 ) , we would expect a relaxed cluster to have @xmath132@xmath1350 , and so this selection should not bias us towards low - ellipticity ( relaxed ) clusters .",
    "we excluded one cluster , a2255 , since it has a very extended surface brightness profile that implies that it is not in a relaxed state .",
    "we also excluded a1651 since the existing  observation is very shallow and the cluster is centered close to a chip gap ( restricting the range of radii over which the ellipticity can be computed ) .",
    "although it is difficult to choose relaxed clusters which exactly match the mass distribution of the simulated clusters , to increase the coverage of lower - mass systems we included a2589 , which just missed our @xmath132  cut but is nonetheless very relaxed and has a virial mass @xmath136(zappacosta et al .",

    "such a monochromatic exposure - map is sufficient for our present purposes .",
    "since our adopted procedure to calculate the ellipticity of a cluster involves taking moments of this image , the presence of bright point - sources ( most likely agn ) can lead to errors in the computation .",
    "it is therefore essential to identify and remove these objects from the image .",
    "point - sources were detected by application of the ciao task wavdetect , which was set to search for structure at scales of 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 pixels , and supplied with the exposure - maps to minimize spurious detections at the image boundaries .",
    "the detection threshold was set to @xmath138 , corresponding to 1 spurious source detections per cluster .",
    "all detected sources were confirmed by visual inspection , and , for each , appropriate elliptical regions containing approximately 99%  of its photons were generated .",

    "the data within each of the elliptical point - source regions were replaced with poisson - deviated noise . for each pixel ,",
    "the mean of the poisson deviate was drawn from the corresponding pixel on the normalized background image , taking into account variations in the exposure - map .",
    "provided the detection algorithm accurately characterizes all the point - sources this is a very robust method for source removal .",
    "however , wavdetect occasionally mis - identifies extended cluster emission as a point - source , or mis - estimates the radius enclosing most of the source photons , and so the background map may be locally incorrect .",
    "the point - source free , `` cleaned '' , image was , therefore , visually inspected to assess how accurately sources were removed . in cases where the source replacement was obviously imperfect , suspicious sources were replaced by assuming the mean ( flat - fielded ) count - rate per pixel is uniform over the point - source region ( this is most correct if the source is at a large radius from the cluster center ) .",
    "this count - rate was estimated for each source by centering a circular extraction region on the source centroid and expanding its radius iteratively until at least 50 photons were found within it , taking care to exclude all photons within any of the source regions .",
    "since the exposure may vary over the pixels within a given source region ( especially near the edge of the image ) , the exposure - map was used to correct this rate on a pixel - by - pixel basis before poisson noise was added .",

    "we show the average x - ray ellipticity profiles of the observed clusters and the simulated cdm clusters ( @xmath201 ) in fig  [ rosat ] , with @xmath202 statistical errors on the mean observed values .",
    "we also list the average observed ellipticities and their errors in the last column of table  [ table_ellipticity ] .",
    "the differences between the profiles are very striking .",
    "while the observed clusters have a nearly constant ellipticity profile ( @xmath203 ) , the simulated csf clusters have much larger ellipticity values ( @xmath204 ) at small radii ( @xmath205 ) before declining to @xmath203 near @xmath5 .",
    "for radii above @xmath4 both the shape and normalization of the profiles are similar for both the simulated and observed clusters .",
    "however , the ellipticity profile of the nc cluster cl7a shows much better agreement with the observed clusters over all radii examined .",
    "the relatively small deviations of this single cluster ( formed in the simulation without cooling or star formation ) from the average ellipticity profile of the observed clusters is consistent with the stochastic variation between the observed clusters ( see table a2 ) .",
    "the pronounced discrepancy over @xmath2 , taken together with the discussion in  [ ellsim ] , demonstrates clearly that the icm in the simulated clusters rotates much more rapidly than in the observed clusters .",
    "furthermore , this excess icm rotation in the simulated cdm clusters extends out to @xmath4 since that is where the ellipticity profiles of the observed and simulated clusters diverge .",
    "the averaged profiles for the csf clusters also are slightly lower than the observations at @xmath206 , indicating either that the csf clusters may rotate a little slower than the observed clusters at larger radii and , perhaps more likely , the csf clusters are slightly more centrally concentrated .",
    "over the past decade theoretical studies of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations have emphasized the important role of random turbulent motions in providing pressure support of the icm in galaxy clusters . using the set of high - resolution cdm simulations of nagai et al .",
    "( 2007 ) we have shown instead that rotational support of the cluster weight exceeds that of random turbulence from @xmath207 and remains comparable out to @xmath87 for the clusters classified as the most relaxed in the simulations .    when we compared the average ellipticity profile of the relaxed cdm clusters to that obtained for a set of 9 real nearby clusters observed by _",
    "chandra _ and _ rosat _ , we found the simulated cdm clusters are significantly flatter within @xmath208 and the profile shapes differ interior to @xmath209 . by comparing simulations with and without radiative cooling and star formation , we conclude that this flatness is mainly caused by gas over - cooling and large - scale rotation .",
    "the substantial icm rotation present in the relaxed simulated cdm clusters very likely indicates that a classical `` rotating cooling flow '' ( nulsen , stewart , & fabian 1984 ; kley & mathews 1994 ; brighenti & mathews 1996 ) operates in those systems , implying large mass deposition rates which are not observed . at very small radii ( @xmath210 ) it is well - known that cosmological hydrodynamical simulations fail to reproduce observed icm properties because of over - cooling , but since the icm rotation we have discussed extends to much larger radii , the over - cooling problem apparently does as well .",
    "we stress that the nagai et al .",
    "( 2007 ) simulations are not unusual in regards to displaying signatures of icm rotation .",
    "recently , jeltema et al .  (",
    "2008 ) compare x - ray images of simulated and observed clusters using power ratios ( buote & tsai 1995 ) .",
    "they find that @xmath211 , which is similar to ellipticity , computed within a 0.5  mpc aperture for their relaxed simulated cdm clusters is slightly larger than for the observed clusters .",
    "they also find that distribution of @xmath212 , which is sensitive to asymmetry but not ellipticity , is consistent for the simulated and observed clusters , implying that it is very unlikely that the @xmath211 ( and hence ellipticity ) discrepancy can be attributed to the chosen cosmology .",
    "since 0.5  mpc corresponds roughly to @xmath213 for clusters , the relatively weak discrepancy is consistent with our results ( see figure [ rosat ] ) .    because the unphysical icm rotation in the relaxed cdm clusters extends out to a large radius ( @xmath4 ) , icm quantities determined within these regions in the simulations need to be reconsidered .",
    "for example , it has been noted by several authors that x - ray measurements of @xmath214 for relaxed clusters assuming hydrostatic equilibrium underestimate the actual mass by @xmath215 ( e.g. , rasia et al .",
    "2006 ; nagai et al .",
    "2007 ; burns et al .  2007 ) .",
    "but since the x - ray analysis involves fitting gas density and temperature profiles of the icm over a large radial range interior to @xmath5 , the region of unphysical icm rotation is included in the analysis .",
    "( note that excluding large radial regions can strongly bias x - ray mass estimates  gastaldello et al .  2007 . ) while we do not expect these x - ray mass underestimates to change radically for relaxed simulated cdm clusters without unphysical icm rotation , given that @xmath216 out to @xmath87 in the simulated clusters we have studied , it is not unreasonable to expect the mass underestimate to be cut in half ( see section 2.4 ) .",
    "this would be of considerable importance to studies using x - ray determinations of cluster masses for precision cosmology .",

    "<S> cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters typically find that the weight of a cluster at a given radius is not balanced entirely by the thermal gas pressure of the hot icm , with theoretical studies emphasizing the role of random turbulent motions to provide the necessary additional pressure support . </S>",
    "<S> using a set of high - resolution , hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters that include radiative cooling and star formation and are formed in a cold dark matter universe , we find instead that in the most relaxed clusters rotational support exceeds that from random turbulent motions for radii , @xmath0 , while at larger radii , out to @xmath1 , they remain comparable . </S>",
    "<S> we also find the x - ray images of the icm flatten prominently over a wide radial range , @xmath2 . when compared to the average ellipticity profile of the observed x - ray images computed for 9 relaxed nearby clusters , we find that the observed clusters are much rounder than the relaxed cdm clusters within @xmath3 . moreover , while the observed clusters display an average ellipticity profile that does not vary significantly with radius , the ellipticity of the relaxed cdm clusters declines markedly with increasing radius , suggesting that the icm of the observed clusters rotates less rapidly than that of the relaxed cdm clusters out to @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> when these results are compared to those obtained from a simulation without radiative cooling , we find a cluster ellipticity profile in much better agreement with the observations , implying that over - cooling has a substantial impact on the gas dynamics and morphology out to larger radii than previously recognized . </S>",
    "<S> it also suggests that the 10%-20% systematic errors from non - thermal gas pressure support reported for simulated cluster masses , obtained from fitting simulated x - ray data over large radial ranges within @xmath5 , may need to be revised downward . </S>",
    "<S> these results demonstrate the utility of x - ray ellipticity profiles as a probe of icm rotation and over - cooling which should be used to constrain future cosmological cluster simulations . </S>"
