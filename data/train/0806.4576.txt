    "epidemic models are classically phrased in ordinary differential equation ( ode ) systems for the host population divided in classes of susceptible individuals and infected ones ( sis system ) , or in addition , a class of recovered individuals due to immunity after an infection to the respective pathogen ( sir epidemics ) .",
    "the infection term includes a product of two variables , hence a non - linearity which in extended systems can cause complicated dynamics . though these simple sis and sir models only show fixed points as equilibrium solutions , they already show non - trivial equilibria arising from bifurcations , and in stochastic versions of the system critical fluctuations at the threshold .",
    "further refinements of the sir model in terms of external forcing or distinction of infections with different strains of a pathogen , hence classes of infected with one or another strain recovered from one or another strain , infected with more than one strain etc .",
    ", can induce more complicated dynamical attractors including equilibria , limit cycles , tori and chaotic attractors .",
    "classical examples of chaos in epidemiological models are childhood diseases with extremely high infection rates , so that a moderate seasonal forcing can generate feigenbaum sequences of period doubling bifurcations into chaos .",
    "the success in analysing childhood diseases in terms of modelling and data comparison lies in the fact that they are just childhood diseases with such high infectivity .",
    "otherwise host populations can not sustain the respective pathogens .",
    "in other infectious diseases much lower forces of infection have to be considered leading to further conceptual problems with noise affecting the system more than the deterministic part , leading even to critical fluctuations with power law behaviour , when considering evolutionary processes of harmless strains of pathogens versus occasional accidents of pathogenic mutants @xcite . only explicitly stochastic models , of which the classical ode models are mean field versions , can capture the fluctuations observed in time series data @xcite .",
    "more recently it has been demonstrated that the interaction of various strains on the infection of the host with eventual cross - immunities or other interactions between host immune system and multiple strains can generate complicated dynamic attractors .",
    "a prime example is dengue fever .",
    "a first infection is often mild or even asymptomatic and leads to life long immunity against this strain .",
    "however , a subsequent infection with another strain of the virus often causes clinical complications up to life threatening conditions and hospitalization , due to ade .",
    "more on the biology of dengue and its consequences for the detailed epidemiological model structure can be found in aguiar and stollenwerk @xcite including literature on previous modelling attempts , see also @xcite . on the biological evidence for ade",
    "see e.g. @xcite . besides the difference in the force of infection between primary and secondary infection , parametrized by a so called ade parameter @xmath1 , which has been demonstrated to show chaotic attractors in a certain parameter region , another effect , the temporary cross - immunity after a first infection against all dengue virus strains , parametrized by the temporary cross - immunity rate @xmath2 , shows bifurcations up to chaotic attractors in a much wider and biologically more realistic parameter region .",
    "the model presented in the appendix has been described in detail in @xcite and has recently been analysed for a parameter value of @xmath3 corresponding to on average half a year of temporary cross immunity which is biologically plausible @xcite . for increasing ade parameter @xmath1 first an equilibrium which bifurcates via a hopf bifurcation into a stable limit cycle and",
    "then after further continuation the limit cycle becomes unstable in a torus bifurcation .",
    "this torus bifurcation can be located using numerical bifurcation software based on continuation methods tracking known equilibria or limit cycles up to bifurcation points @xcite .",
    "the continuation techniques and the theory behind it are described e.g. in kuznetsov @xcite .",
    "complementary methods like lyapunov exponent spectra can also characterize chaotic attractor @xcite , and led ultimately to the detection of coexisting attractors to the main limit cycles and tori originated from the analytically accessible fixed point for small @xmath1 .",
    "such coexisting structures are often missed in bifurcation analysis of higher dimensional dynamical systems but are demonstrated to be crucial at times in understanding qualitatively the real world data , as for example demonstrated previously in a childhood disease study @xcite . in such a study first the understanding of the deterministic system s attractor structure is needed , and then eventually the interplay between attractors mediated by population noise in the stochastic version of the system gives the full understanding of the data .",
    "here we present for the first time extended results of the bifurcation structure for various parameter values of the temporary cross immunity @xmath2 in the region of biological relevance and multi - parameter bifurcation analysis .",
    "this reveals besides the torus bifurcation route to chaos also the classical feigenbaum period doubling sequence and the origin of so called isola solutions .",
    "the symmetry of the different strains leads to symmerty breaking bifurcations of limit cycles , which are rarely described in the epidemiological literature but well known in the biochemical literature , e.g for coupled identical cells .",
    "the interplay between different numerical procedures and basic analytic insight in terms of symmetries help to understand the attractor structure of multi - strain interactions in the present case of dengue fever , and will contribute to the final understanding of dengue epidemiology including the observed fluctuations in real world data . in the literature the multi - strain interaction leading to deterministic chaos via ade has been described previously , e.g. @xcite but neglecting temporary cross immunity and hence getting stuck in rather unbiological parameter regions , whereas more recently the first considerations of temporary cross immunity in rather complicated and up to now not in detail analysed models including all kinds of interations have appeared @xcite , in this case failing to investigate closer the possible dynamical structures .",
    "the multistrain model under investigation can be given as an ode system @xmath4 for the state vector of the epidemiological host classes @xmath5 and besides other fixed parameters which are biologically undisputed the parameter vector of varied parameters @xmath6 .",
    "for a detailed description of the biological content of state variables and parameters see @xcite .",
    "the ode equations and fixed parameter values are given in the appendix .",
    "the equilibrium values @xmath7 are given by the equilibrium condition @xmath8 , respectively for limit cycles @xmath9 with period @xmath10 .",
    "for chaotic attractors the trajectory of the dynamical system reaches in the time limit of infinity the attractor trajectory @xmath11 , equally for tori with irrational winding ratios . in all cases",
    "the stability can be analysed considering small perturbations @xmath12 around the attractor trajectories @xmath13 here , any attractor is notified by @xmath14 , be it an equilibrium , periodic orbit or chaotic attractor . in this ode system",
    "the linearized dynamics is given with the jacobian matrix @xmath15 of the ode system eq .",
    "( [ dynamicsf ] ) evaluated at the trajectory points @xmath14 given in notation of @xmath16 .",
    "the jacobian matrix is analyzed for equilibria in terms of eigenvalues to determine stability and the loss of it at bifurcation points , negative real part indicating stability .",
    "for the stability and loss of it for limit cylces floquet multipliers are more common ( essentially the exponentials of eigenvalues ) , multipliers inside the unit circle indicating stability , and where they leave eventually the unit circle determining the type of limit cycle bifurcations . and for chaotic systems lyapunov exponents are determined from the jacobian around the trajectory , positive largest exponents showing deterministic chaos , zero largest showing limit cycles including tori , largest smaller zero indicating fixed points .      to investigate the bifurcation structure of the system under investigation we first observe the symmetries due to the multi - strain structure of the model .",
    "this becomes important for the time being for equilibria and limit cycles .",
