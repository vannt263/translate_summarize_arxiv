    "the factor of @xmath53 favors the two - exciton process at high exciton densities , but goes to infinity when the number of excitons falls to 1 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rateplots ] ) .",
    "this divergence reflects the fact that a single exciton can not decay by a two - exciton process .",
    "the third factor , @xmath54 , is the ratio of the system size  the length of the nanotube  to the exciton radius , which is on the order of the nanotube radius .",
    "it strongly favors exciton - electron recombination .",
    "the physical meaning of this term lies in the finite extent of the exciton wave function . for two excitons to recombine , their wave functions must overlap .",
    "the exciton - electron process involves a bloch electron , which is delocalized throughout the entire system . the electron wave function _ always _ overlaps the exciton wave function .",
    "the boltzmann weight @xmath55 is due to the kinetic energy barrier of exciton - electron recombination .",

    "exciton - electron recombination will be frozen out , but at high temperatures , the boltzmann weight will be irrelevant ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rateplots ] ) .",
    "an important caveat is that the temperature in this expression is the effective temperature of the exciton population .",
    "although most experiments are performed at room temperature , the lasers used to generate excitons could cause significant heating of the nanotube , resulting in a much larger effective temperature .    despite the numerical prefactor and kinetic energy barrier ,",
    "the rate of exciton - electron recombination is comparable to two - exciton recombination .",

    "this suggests that auger recombination of dark excitons mediated by a free charge carrier leads to an exciton lifetime on the order of a few @xmath6 .",
    "exciton - electron recombination could provide an efficient nonradiative decay mechanism for dark excitons in carbon nanotubes .",
    "eq .  ( [ eq : ratio ] ) suggests two experimental signatures of auger recombination mediated by free charge carriers .",
    "first , the decay rate is proportional to the doping density and will increase linearly with the number of free charge carriers at low doping densities .",
    "( at higher doping densities , the approximation of infinitesimal doping breaks down and a modified calculation of the rate is necessary . )",
    "the number of free charge carriers could be controlled with a gate voltage for nanotubes deposited on a substrate .",
    "another possibility is intentionally doping nanotubes with specific surfactants or solvents . for nanotubes in solution ,",
    "the quantum yield varies with the ph.@xcite exciton - electron recombination could be relevant to this effect .",
    "the second experimental signature of auger recombination mediated by free charge carriers is a freeze out at low temperatures . for @xmath58",
    ", no excitons will acquire the necessary kinetic energy to decay by this process . the decay rate should decrease with decreasing temperature , as should the quantum yield . a plot of the logarithm of the decay rate versus the inverse temperature should exhibit linear scaling .",
    "these effects could be extracted from the exponential tails of fluorescence and transient absorption measurements . at short times ,",
    "exciton - exciton recombination is the dominant relaxation pathway and the effects of single - exciton processes would be difficult to extract from the data .",
    "a model calculation suggests that auger recombination mediated by free charge carriers in carbon nanotubes could provide an efficient nonradiative decay channel for dark excitons .",
    "nanotubes may be doped  intentionally or unintentionally  and this would provide a population of free charge carriers that could participate in auger recombination processes . as a result , the decay rate of a dilute exciton population could be highly sensitive to doping and the temperature of the sample .",
    "recombination mediated by free charge carries is not the only candidate for an efficient nonradiative decay process .",
    "et al . _",
    "have analyzed multi - phonon decays and phonon - assisted decays in doped carbon nanotubes as well as the effects of exciton localization.@xcite experimental measurements of the relation between exciton lifetimes , the doping density , and temperature should give more insight into the mechanism responsible for the low quantum yields in carbon nanotubes .",
    "more detailed calculations might provide new insight as well .",
    "the model presented here could be extended in several ways .",
    "one is to include the effects of two degenerate valleys in the nanotube band structure .",
    "this is unlikely to have a significant effect on the result .",
    "the symmetry of a dark exciton , which forbids its own radiative recombination , would only have a small effect on the calculated decay rate .",
    "the dominant contribution to the decay rate comes from the scattering process in which a free electron recombines with the hole in the exciton .",
    "the antisymmetry of the exciton wave function does not have a significant effect on the probability of finding a _ free _ electron and the bound hole in the same place .",
    "it seems likely that free charge carriers in carbon nanotubes can have a significant effect on exciton population dynamics , but further study is necessary to definitively establish their role in the low quantum yields reported in photoluminescence experiments .",
