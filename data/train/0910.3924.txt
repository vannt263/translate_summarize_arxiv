    "a precise understanding of the origin of observed neutrino masses and mixing is one of the major goals of particle physics right now .",
    "a simple paradigm for understanding the smallness of the masses is the seesaw mechanism  @xcite where one introduces three standard model ( sm ) singlet right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos with majorana masses @xmath4 , which mix with left - handed ( lh ) ones via the yukawa coupling @xmath5 .",
    "the resulting formula for light neutrino masses is given by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the dirac neutrino mass .",
    "since the sm does not restrict the majorana mass @xmath4 , we could choose this to be much larger than the weak scale thereby providing a natural way to understand the tiny neutrino masses .",
    "this is called the type i seesaw .",
    "there are several variations of this mechanism where one replaces the rh neutrino by either a sm triplet higgs field ( type ii seesaw )  @xcite or sm triplet of fermions ( called type iii seesaw )  @xcite .",
    "a great deal of attention has been devoted to testing these ideas . as far as the type i seesaw",
    "is concerned , the prospects of testing this depends on the scale @xmath4 as well as any associated physics that comes with it at that scale .",
    "it can be accessible to current and future collider experiments if the scale is not far above a tev . a different way to test the type i seesaw mechanism follows from the observation that this mechanism involves the mixing of the lh neutrinos with sm singlet heavy neutrinos as a result of which there would in general be violation of unitarity of the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) mixing matrix that describes only the mixing of the three light neutrinos .",
    "one could contemplate searching for such effects in oscillation experiments  @xcite .",
    "however , in the type i seesaw case , the resulting mixing effects are of order @xmath8 and since neutrino masses are in the sub - ev range , such non - unitarity effects are too small to be observable for generic high scale seesaw models",
    ". this would also be true with tev mass rh neutrinos unless there are cancellations to get small neutrino masses from large dirac masses using symmetries ( see for example cases with  @xcite ) .",
    "we note that the non - unitarity effects are also there in the type iii seesaw case but not in the type ii case even though they have other interesting effects such as lfv processes  @xcite .    since the testability of seesaw",
    "is intimately related to the magnitude of the seesaw scale , a key question of interest is whether there could be any theoretical guidelines for the seesaw scale . in such a case , the searches for seesaw effects in experiments could then be used to test the nature of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "it is well - known that   @xcite the simplest grand unified theory ( gut ) realizations of the seesaw mechanism are based on the @xmath0 group which automatically predicts the existence of the rh neutrinos ( along with the sm fermions ) required by the seesaw mechanism .",
    "an advantage of gut embedding of the seesaw mechanism is that the constraints of gut symmetry tends to relate the dirac neutrino mass @xmath7 to the charged fermion masses thereby making a prediction for the seesaw scale @xmath4 from observations . for type",
    "i seesaw gut embedding , typical values for the @xmath4 are very high ( in the range of @xmath9 - @xmath10 gev ) .",
    "this makes both the collider as well as non - unitarity probes of seesaw impossible .",
    "the key feature that leads to such restrictions in type i seesaw case is the close link between the @xmath11 breaking rh neutrino mass and the smallness of the lh neutrino masses .",
    "a completely different realization of the seesaw mechanism is the so - called inverse seesaw mechanism  @xcite , where instead of one set of three sm singlet fermions , one introduces two sets of them @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) . in the context of @xmath0 models , since one of the two sets can be identified with the sm singlet neutrino in the @xmath0 * 16 * -representation containing matter , the others would have to be a separate set of three @xmath0 singlet fermions . due to the existence of the second set of singlet fermions ( and perhaps additional gauge symmetries e.g. @xmath0 ) , the neutrino mass formula in these models has the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 breaks the lepton number .",
    "because of the presence of this new mass scale in this theory , the seesaw scale @xmath4 can be very close to a tev even for `` large '' dirac masses .",
    "this makes the tests of this possibility in colliders much more feasible .",
    "in fact it has recently been argued that  @xcite the inverse seesaw scenario can also lead to non - negligible non - unitarity effects which can be accessible at the future long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "there are also significant lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) effects in these models as noted many years ago in ref .",
    "these possibilities have generated a great deal of interest in the inverse seesaw models in recent days  @xcite .",
    "our effort in this paper focuses on possible grand unification of inverse seesaw models .",
    "similar unification studies have been performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , but they have not addressed the non - unitarity issues .    an interesting question is whether such models are necessarily compatible with grand unification when the seesaw scale is in the tev range and if so what kind of non - unitarity effects they predict .",
    "we find that it is indeed possible to embed the tev scale inverse seesaw models within a simple @xmath0 framework consistent with gauge coupling unification and realistic fermion masses .",
    "the @xmath0 symmetry helps to reduce the number of parameters in the inverse seesaw matrix , once we require degeneracy of the tev scale rh neutrinos to have successful resonant leptogenesis . within this set of assumptions",
    ", we present our expectations for the non - unitarity effects as well as consequences for lepton flavor violation which are in the testable range in future experiments .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we describe the general framework of the inverse seesaw model and its embedding into a generic supersymmetric @xmath0 theory . in section 3 ,",
    "we analyze the non - unitarity predictions of the inverse seesaw model . in section 4",
    ", we investigate a specific @xmath0 breaking chain and obtain the gauge coupling unification with tev scale left - right symmetry with unification scale consistent with proton decay bounds . in section 5",
    ", we analyze the renormalization group ( rg ) evolution of the yukawa couplings and obtain the running masses for quarks and leptons at the unification scale to check that our model leads to realistic fermion masses . in section 6 , we determine the dirac neutrino mass matrix using the results of section 5 . in section 7",
    ", we study the implication of our model on non - unitarity effects and its phenomenological consequences .",
    "a brief summary of the results is presented in section 8 . in appendix",
    "a , we have given the expressions for the masses of the @xmath0 higgs multiplets in our model , and in appendix b , we have derived the rg equations for the quark and lepton masses and the ckm mixing elements in the context of a supersymmetric left - right model .",
    "the inverse seesaw scheme was originally suggested  @xcite for theories which lack the representation required to implement the canonical seesaw , such as the superstring models . as noted in the introduction ,",
    "the implementation of the inverse seesaw requires the addition of three extra sm gauge singlets @xmath16 coupled to the rh neutrinos @xmath17 through the lepton number conserving couplings of the type @xmath18 while the traditional rh neutrino majorana mass term is forbidden by extra symmetries .",
    "the lepton number is broken only by the self coupling term @xmath19 .",
    "the mass part of the neutrino sector lagrangian in the flavor basis is given by @xmath20 where @xmath15 is a complex symmetric @xmath21 matrix ( with dimension of mass ) , and @xmath7 and @xmath4 are generic @xmath21 complex matrices representing the dirac mass terms in the @xmath22 - @xmath23 and @xmath23 - @xmath24 sectors respectively . in the basis @xmath25 , the @xmath26 neutrino mass matrix becomes @xmath27 the lh neutrinos can be made very light ( sub - ev scale ) , as required by the oscillation data , even for a low @xmath4 , much smaller than the unification scale ( @xmath28 ) , provided @xmath15 is sufficiently small , @xmath29 , as the lepton number breaking scale @xmath15 is decoupled from the rh neutrino mass scale . assuming @xmath30 ( with @xmath31 tev ) , the structure of the light neutrino majorana mass term at the leading order in @xmath32 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : neutrino ] ) , where @xmath33 is a complex @xmath21 matrix .",
    "we note that in the limit @xmath34 which corresponds to the unbroken lepton number , we have massless lh neutrinos as in the sm . in reality",
    ", a small non - vanishing @xmath15 can be viewed as a slight breaking of a global @xmath35 symmetry ; hence , the smallness of @xmath15 is natural , in the t hooft sense  @xcite , even though there is no dynamical understanding of this smallness .    the generic form of the inverse seesaw matrix in eq .",
    "( [ eq : big ] ) has more parameters than the usual type i seesaw .",
    "however , if we embed this theory into a grand unified theory such as @xmath0 , that will help in reducing the parameters as we show below . in order to embed the inverse see - saw mechanism into a generic @xmath0 theory , we have to break the @xmath11 symmetry by using a @xmath36 pair rather than the @xmath37 pair of higgs representation .",
    "all the sm fermions are accommodated in a single @xmath38 representation of @xmath0 and we use three copies of @xmath39 for three generations . for each of them ,",
    "we add a gauge singlet fermion @xmath40 to play the role of @xmath16 .",
    "we assume more than one copy of @xmath41 higgs multiplets in order to have a realistic fermionic spectrum .",

    "thus , we can get sub - ev light neutrino mass for @xmath53 kev .",
    "since this is a supersymmetric theory , such small values do not receive radiative corrections and keep the model natural . in the following section , we consider three generations which then results in the non - unitarity effect .",
    "it is important to note that in our model , we do not need to impose a discrete @xmath54-parity to our matter fermions , unlike the usual @xmath55 @xmath0 models discussed in literature , in order to prevent fast proton decay via dimension-4 operators of the type @xmath56 because these operators are already suppressed by a factor @xmath57 for a low - scale @xmath11 breaking with @xmath58 tev .",
    "the @xmath21 light neutrino mass matrix in eq .",
    "( [ eq : neutrino ] ) can be diagonalized by a unitary transformation : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the standard pmns matrix . since the above diagonalization of @xmath61",
    "does not diagonalize the matrices @xmath4 and @xmath15 , there will be off - diagonal mixing between the different light neutrinos even after diagonalization of @xmath61 due to their mixing with the heavy neutrinos .",
    "in other words , in the basis where the charged - lepton mass matrix is diagonal , @xmath60 is only a part of the full mixing matrix responsible for neutrino oscillations .",
    "we have to examine the full @xmath26 unitary matrix @xmath62 which diagonalizes the mass matrix @xmath63 given by eq .",

    ". then the new pmns matrix becomes  @xcite @xmath68 in the commonly used parametrization  @xcite , @xmath69 , and hence , all the non - unitarity effects are determined by the hermitian matrix @xmath70 which depends only on the mass ratio @xmath33 and not on the parametrization of the pmns matrix .",

    "the flavor and mass eigenstates of the lh neutrinos are now connected by a non - unitary mixing matrix @xmath69 , where the non - unitarity effects entering different neutrino oscillation channels are measured by the parameter @xmath76 . in particular , the @xmath77-violating effects in the leptonic sector will now be governed by the pmns matrix @xmath78 instead of @xmath60 through the jarlskog invariant  @xcite @xmath79 where the indices @xmath80 run over @xmath81 and @xmath82 , while @xmath83 can be 1 , 2 and 3 . in the standard pmns parametrization of @xmath60 by the three mixing angles @xmath84 and the dirac @xmath77-phase @xmath85 , one can expand eq .",

    "however , @xmath93 depends on the off - diagonal elements of @xmath76 ( generally complex ) and does not necessarily vanish even if both @xmath94 and @xmath85 are zero ; in fact , it might even dominate the @xmath77-violating effects in the leptonic sector .",
    "2 .   the heavy neutrinos @xmath17 and @xmath95 entering the charged - current sector can also mediate the rare lepton decays , @xmath96 .",
    "hence , unlike in the canonical seesaw model where this contribution is suppressed by the light neutrino masses  @xcite , in this case it is constrained mainly by the ratio @xmath33 .",
    "the lfv decays mediated by these heavy neutrinos have branching ratios  @xcite @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the total decay width of @xmath99 and the function @xmath100 is defined by @xmath101 for degenerate rh neutrino masses , a reasonable assumption inspired by resonant leptogenesis  @xcite , the amplitude is proportional to @xmath102 , and hence , for sizeable @xmath67 and tev - scale rh sector , one could expect appreciable rates in the lfv channels . on the other hand , in the conventional type i seesaw model , one has approximately @xmath103 , and therefore , the branching ratio , @xmath104 is strongly suppressed .",
    "3 .   the heavy neutrinos @xmath17 and @xmath95 also couple to the gauge sector of the sm and can be produced on - shell , if kinematically accessible , at hadron colliders via the gauge boson exchange diagrams . due to their pseudo - dirac nature , the striking lepton number violating lhc signature of the fine - tuned type i and type iii scenarios , namely @xmath105 jets , will be suppressed for heavy majorana states due to cancellation between the graphs with internal lines of the @xmath23 and @xmath106 type which have opposite @xmath77-quantum numbers .",
    "however , the lfv processes are insensitive to this effect and one can expect to get observable signals at the lhc",
    ". the most distinctive signature would be the observation of lfv processes involving three charged leptons in the final state plus missing energy , i.e. @xmath107 jets  @xcite .",
    "thus we see that the phenomenology of the inverse seesaw mechanism depends crucially on the mass ratio @xmath33 . as noted earlier",
    ", we can choose the rh neutrino masses to be degenerate ( with eigenvalue @xmath108 ) , inspired by resonant leptogenesis .",
    "so we are left with a single mass parameter @xmath108 , together with the dirac mass matrix @xmath7 and the arbitrary small mass parameter @xmath15 . in what follows",
    ", we explicitly determine the form of @xmath7 in the context of a realistic supersymmetric @xmath0 model and then use the present experimental bounds on the elements of the non - unitary parameter @xmath109 to get a lower bound on the rh neutrino mass scale @xmath108 .",
    "finally we fit the observed lh neutrino mass and mixing parameters by the inverse seesaw formula to determine the structure of @xmath15 .",
    "we then study the phenomenological consequences of our results .",
    "as we have mentioned earlier , in order to embed the inverse seesaw mechanism into a supersymmetric @xmath0 theory , we have to break the @xmath11 symmetry by using a * 16 *  @xmath110 pair rather than a * 126 *  @xmath111 pair of higgs representation . in this context , there are two symmetry breaking chains that are particularly interesting :    * @xmath112  @xcite * @xmath113 + @xmath114  @xcite    where , as an example of our notation , @xmath115 means @xmath116 . in this paper , we consider only the former ( and simpler ) case of @xmath0 breaking chain .",

    ", we consider a model with two @xmath119 at the tev scale .",
    "this requires that we reexamine the unification issue with two higgs bi - doublets .",
    "we show that we not only obtain the gauge coupling unification at a scale consistent with the proton decay bounds , but also successfully reproduce the observed fermion masses and mixing .",
    "to study the running of the gauge couplings and the possibility of their unification at a scale @xmath121 gev , we divide the whole energy range @xmath122 into three parts , according to the above mentioned symmetry breaking chain :    * first , we have the well known sm from the weak scale @xmath123 to the susy - breaking scale @xmath124 ( which , for practical purposes , we assume to be a little higher than @xmath123 ) ; * then we have the mssm from @xmath124 to the @xmath11 breaking scale @xmath118 ( which is assumed to be of order tev , so that it is of interest for colliders ) ; * finally , we have the supersymmetric left - right ( susylr ) model from @xmath118 to the unification scale @xmath125 ( expected to be around @xmath126 gev )",
