    "in neutron - rich nuclei , there often appear exotic phenomena which are very different from those in stable nuclei due to the excess neutrons . some properties of neutron - rich nuclei",
    "are concerned with differences between proton and neutron densities .",
    "neutron halo and skin structures are typical examples . another related subject is deformations of proton and neutron densities . for example , the difference of the deformations between proton and neutron densities were theoretically suggested in some be , b and c isotopes @xcite .",
    "these phenomena imply that the structure of the nuclei far from the @xmath10-stability line often contradicts to the usual understanding for stable nuclei where the proton and neutron densities are consistent with each other in a nucleus .",
    "they may lead also to exotic phenomena in excitations and reactions .",
    "one of the current issues is the dipole excitations in neutron - rich nuclei @xcite .",
    "since it is quite natural to expect the low - energy isovector - dipole excitations due to the difference between the proton and neutron densities , interests are attracted to the soft resonances below the giant dipole resonance(gdr ) , their collectivity and the contributions of the excess neutrons .",
    "in fact , the features of dipole transitions in neutron - rich o isotopes have been studied experimentally@xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "they have been found to be different from those in the stable nucleus , @xmath2o , especially in the low energy region below the gdr .",
    "the dipole excitations have been studied also in c isotopes by suzuki et al . with shell model calculations@xcite , where they suggested that coherent neutron transitions enhance the strengths at the excitation energy @xmath11 mev .",
    "our present interest is in the isovector dipole excitations in the light neutron - rich nuclei and in the effect of the ground state properties like the deformations on the @xmath9 strengths .",
    "a method of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics(amd)@xcite is one of powerful approaches for nuclear structure study .",
    "the method is superior especially in the description of cluster aspect , which is important in light unstable nuclei as well as in light stable nuclei@xcite . in the systematic studies of",
    "be , b , and c isotopes performed with the amd method , a variety of structure such as the neutron skin and the deformed states have been suggested in those nuclei , and some of them have been discussed in relation to cluster aspect@xcite .",
    "the experimental data for various properties of the neutron - rich be , b and c isotopes have been successfully reproduced by the amd calculations .",
    "we should stress that the amd calculations well agree to the experimental data of quadrupole moments and @xmath12 strengths in neutron - rich b and c , which can not be reproduced by the shell model calculations without using system - dependent effective charges . for the study of dipole excitations in the amd framework",
    ", we apply a time - dependent method and calculate the dipole strengths in a similar way to the the time - dependent hartree - fock(tdhf ) .",
    "the point is that we are able to study dipole resonances with the framework which can describe cluster aspect .",
    "one of the advantages of the time - dependent amd is that we can link the excitations with such collective modes as core vibration , core - neutron motion and inter - cluster motion which should be important to understand the role of the excess neutrons in the dipole resonances .",
    "the time - dependent method of amd have been proposed and applied to heavy - ion reactions by ono et al . in 1992@xcite",
    "earlier than the application of the amd to the nuclear structure study . for collective motion on the static solution",
    ", however , the time - dependent amd calculations have not been performed yet . in this paper , we formulate a method based of the time - dependent amd for the study of @xmath9 response in analogy to the tdhf . in order to see its validity , we first apply it to @xmath5c and @xmath8o , and show comparison with the experimental data and other theoretical calculations .",
    "then we apply this method to be , b and c isotopes and discuss the properties of dipole strengths in the neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "we try to see how the dipole strength distribution is influenced by such structure as deformations , neutron skin , the existence of core and clusters .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we explain the formulation of the present method for the @xmath9 response , which is based on the time - dependent amd",
    ". adopted effective nuclear forces are described in [ sec : interaction ] . in [ sec : results ] , we show the results of @xmath5c , @xmath8o and the comparison with the experimental data , and also the dipole transitions in be , b , c isotopes .",
    "the discussion of the @xmath9 excitations in neutron - rich be , b , and c isotopes are given in [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "finally , in [ sec : summary ] we give a summary .",
    "we explain the formulation of the time - dependent version of amd for study of isovector dipole excitations . by simulating time evolution of the collective motion on the static solution with the time - dependent amd",
    ", we can calculate the response of a nucleus to external dipole fields and obtain the dipole strengths in the similar way to tdhf approaches .    the time - dependent method in the amd framework",

    "although an extra normalization factor of the wave function arises from this transformation , it gives no effect on the physical quantities because the amd framework is always based on the normalized wave functions .    by using the equation of motion ( eq.([eq : eqmotion ] ) ) , we can calculate the time evolution of the system , @xmath48 , from the initial state @xmath49 following the time - dependent amd .",

    "the reason for such a large @xmath58 is considered to be due to the limitation of the present model space and lack of the effects of continuum states . for the quantitative discussion of the magnitude of the gdr strength , further quenching and the spreading are needed in the present calculations .    although the quantitative description of the peak positions and the magnitudes of the gdr are not sufficient , the characteristic behavior of the calculated cross section is in reasonable agreement with that of the experimental data , and is consistent with other theoretical calculations . since @xmath5c has the oblate deformed ground state , the vibration for the @xmath84 and @xmath85-axes forms the gdr in the same energy , which results in an enhancement of the lower part of the gdr . in the results of @xmath8o ,",

    ", we can state that the calculated strengths of the low - lying resonances reasonably agree to the experimental data .",
    "one of the reason for the overestimating excitation energies of the dipole resonances is considered to be because the surface diffuseness may be underestimated by the simple amd wave function",

    "the dipole resonances in @xmath0be can be decomposed into two parts @xmath102 mev and @xmath103 mev .",

    "the lower peak appears in the vibration along the longitudinal axis(@xmath85 ) . as seen in figs.[fig : radii ] and [ fig : defo ] , @xmath101be has the large prolate deformation of the neutron density as well as the large neutron radius , and hence , it has the enhanced neutron skin structure along the longitudinal direction .",
    "the decrease of the excitation energy of the lower gdr peak is naturally understood because of the developed neutron skin .",
    "also in the tdhf+abc calculations @xcite , the gdr for the longitudinal motion appears at @xmath93 mev , while the higher peak for the transverse motion is around @xmath112 mev .",
    "although the peak position of the gdr for each direction is similar to the present results , the gdr is not splitting in the tdhf+abc results because the widths are largely spread .",
    "another difference with the present results is that there exists a very soft resonance at @xmath113 mev in tdhf+abc .",
    "these differences seem natural because of the following reason .",
    "the spreading and quenching of the gdr may be large in @xmath101be , which has a small neutron separation energy and therefore the dipole strengths should be affected by the continuum states and the long tail of the neutron halo structure .",
    "these effects are not taken into account in the present framework , while they are included in the tdhf+abc . in the shell model calculations ,",
    "the large @xmath9 strength is found in the low energy region ( @xmath114 mev ) when including the @xmath115 shell configurations with a warburton - brown(wbp ) interaction @xcite .",

    "the excitation energy of the gdr is smaller than that of the @xmath117b .",

    "the reason why four neutrons move coherently in the @xmath137+@xmath5c+@xmath137 configuration is easily understood as follows . since the @xmath137+@xmath5c+@xmath137 configuration is linear",

    ", the remarkable soft peaks appear at @xmath3 mev due to the motion of the valence nucleons against to the core , while the gdr at @xmath121 mev arises from the vibration within the core . therefore it is considered that the gdr may reflect mainly the features of the core nuclei instead of the deformations of the total system .",
    "in fact , the gdr of @xmath0be lies at a similar excitation energy to that of @xmath147be .    below the gdr region",

    "especially , @xmath0be , @xmath1b and @xmath2c have the remarkable soft peaks , which are decoupled with the gdr . in the neutron - rich nuclei ,",
    "the cluster sum rule@xcite is a convenient measure to estimate the contribution of the motion of the excess neutrons in the dipole strengths@xcite . assuming clustering with a core and @xmath149 valence neutrons",
    ", we consider the core cluster with @xmath150 and the valence cluster with @xmath151 .",
    "the cluster sum rule is given as , @xmath152 this value is the remainder when one subtract the core contribution of the classical ewsr from the total @xmath120 value .",
    "consequently , @xmath153 is the margin which indicates the contribution of the excess neutrons .",
    "the integrated strength of the low - energy resonances should be compared with @xmath153 to see the softness and collectivity of the resonances due to the valence neutron motion against the core . in table",
    "[ tab : c - sum ] , the ewsr for the low - lying resonances are listed with the values of the classical trk sum rule and the cluster sum rule(@xmath153 ) . in the derivation of the cluster sum rule @xmath153 ,",
    "the core cluster is assumed to be @xmath100be , @xmath117b , @xmath5c and @xmath2o , in be , b , c and o isotopes , respectively .",
    "we show the ewsr values integrated up to @xmath154 mev and @xmath125 mev in the present results , and the ewsr with other calculations .",
    "the ratios of the ewsr to @xmath120 and @xmath153 are shown in figs.[fig : sum](a ) and [ fig : sum](b ) , respectively . in c isotopes , @xmath96 mev ) is the largest in @xmath2c and it declines in further neutron - rich c isotopes .",
    "the present results of c isotopes well agree to the shell model calculations@xcite . also in b isotopes , the similar feature is found .",
    "namely , @xmath96 mev ) is the largest in @xmath1b and it decreases in further neutron - rich nucleus @xmath7b .",
    "the striking point is that the ewsr for the low - lying resonances is remarkably enhanced in the moderately neutron - rich nuclei with an appropriate number of excess neutrons , but it is suppressed in very neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "it is reasonable because the enhancement of the soft dipole strengths is due to the coherent motion of the valence neutrons relative to the core .",
    "it means that the decoupled collective modes appear based on the relative motion between the core and valence neutrons and the motion inside the core , in @xmath1b and @xmath2c . on the other hand , as the neutron skin develops in further neutron - rich nuclei @xmath155 , the motion of the excess neutrons is not decoupled but they join the neutrons inside the core . as a result , in @xmath7b and @xmath126c , the soft dipole mode is assimilated into the gdr , and the excitation energy of the gdr decreases . also in @xmath0be , the ewsr for the low - lying resonances is significant as well as @xmath1b and @xmath2c . in these nuclei , the cluster sum rule value @xmath153 is almost exhausted by the calculated @xmath156 mev ) . in @xmath101be , the @xmath157 mev ) is very large due to the peak at @xmath158 mev .",

    "does not originate in the soft resonance decoupled from the gdr , but the gdr for the longitudinal vibration itself contributes the ewsr for low - energy region because it becomes soft due to the prolate deformation with a developed neutron skin structure .",

    "it was found that the remarkable peaks appear in @xmath0be , @xmath1b , and @xmath2c at @xmath3 mev which almost exhaust the values of the cluster sum rule .",
    "these soft dipole resonances arise from the relative motion between excess neutrons and the core , which is decoupled with the motion inside the core . in other words ,",
    "these soft resonances appear due to the excitation of the excess neutrons around the rather hard core .",
    "this nature of the neutron excitation and the inert core may have a link with such ground - band properties of the @xmath2c as the unusually small @xmath162@xcite , which has been recently investigated in theoretical and experimental studies @xcite .",
    "in further neutron - rich b and c isotopes with @xmath155 , the strength for the soft dipole resonances declines compared with that of @xmath1b and @xmath2c .",
    "it is considered to be because the motion of the excess neutrons assimilates into the neutron motion within the core . as a result , the excitation energies of the gdr decrease with the enhancement of the neutron - skin .",
    "it is striking that the strength for the soft dipole resonances does not necessarily increase with the increase of the excess neutrons .",
    "instead , the feature of the soft resonances rapidly changes depending on the proton and neutron numbers of the system .",
    "the key of the soft dipole resonance with a remarkable strength is how the coherent motion of the valence neutrons is decoupled with the motion inside the core .",
    "the present method based on the time - dependent amd is regarded as a kind of small - amplitude time - dependent hartree - fock calculations within the amd model space .",
    "the point of the method is that we are able to study dipole resonances with the framework which can describe cluster aspect . in the amd approach ,",
    "the dipole excitations are expressed by the motion of single - particle gaussian wave packets , because the expectation value of the dipole operator is related directly to the centers of the gaussian wave packets .",
    "one of the advantages of the time - dependent amd is that we can link the excitations with such collective modes as core vibration , core - neutron motion and inter - cluster motion , which should be important to understand the role of the excess neutrons in the dipole resonances .",
    "recently , extended methods of time - dependent mean - field calculations have been proposed and applied to the dipole transitions in neutron - rich nuclei . in the tdhf+abc approach , which have been applied to deformed neutron - rich nuclei by nakatsukasa and yabana@xcite ,",
    "the effects of continuum states are taken into account .",
    "another method is the time - dependent density - matrix theory which has been applied to @xmath163o by incorporating two - body correlations @xcite . in the present work",
    ", the contributions of continuum states are omitted , and the detailed descriptions of wave functions and two - body correlations should be insufficient , as the model space is a simple amd wave function written by a slater determinant of gaussian wave packets .",
    "therefore , we put an artificial smoothing parameter to simulate the width of the dipole resonances , because it is difficult to describe the escape and the spreading widths of the resonances in the present framework .",
    "further extensions of the model must be essential to give quantitative discussions of the excitation energies and the strengths of the dipole resonances in nuclei near the drip line .",
    "it should be necessary to solve the remaining problem of the soft resonances in halo nuclei @xcite .",
    "we comment that the usual amd wave functions applied to the nuclear structure study are the advanced ones with some extensions such as the parity and spin projections , deformed gaussian base and generator coordinate method @xcite , though the present amd wave function is the simplest one with no extension . a combination of the time - dependent method and the extended amd wave functions should be needed to include higher correlations beyond the present calculations , and also to obtain better description of the ground state properties .",
    "moreover , interaction dependence of the dipole transitions is a remaining problem .",
