    "recently , ryo hanaki introduced the notion of a _ pseudodiagram _ of a knot , link or spatial graph  @xcite .",
    "a pseudodiagram of a knot is a knot diagram that may be missing some crossing information , as in figure  [ f0 ] . in other words , at some crossings in a pseudodiagram it is unknown which strand passes over and which passes under .",
    "these undetermined crossings are called _",
    "precrossings_. special classes of pseudodiagrams are knot diagrams and knot _ shadows _ , i.e. pseudodiagrams containing only precrossings .",
    "pseudodiagrams were originally considered because of their potential to serve as useful models for biological objects related to dna , but they are interesting objects in their own right .    , width=364 ]    of particular interest in pseudodiagram theory is the computation of the _ trivializing number _ and _ knotting number _ for pseudodiagrams .",
    "the trivializing number is the least number of precrossings that must be resolved into crossings in order to produce a pseudodiagram of the unknot .",
    "( that is , regardless of how the remaining precrossings are resolved , the unknot is always produced . )",
    "similarly , the knotting number is the least number of precrossings that must be determined to produce a nontrivial knot .",
    "much work has been done to analyze trivializing and knotting numbers  @xcite ,  @xcite .    for the purposes of this paper ,",
    "we are interested in studying the knot theory that arises from considering equivalence classes of pseudodiagrams under equivalence relations generated by a natural set of reidemeister moves .",
    "we refer to these objects as _",
    "pseudoknots_. our choice of the set of reidemeister moves for pseudoknots , pictured in figure  [ rmoves ] , was inspired by the theory of singular knots .",
    "singular knots are knots that contain a finite number of self - intersections .",
    "if we view precrossings as singular crossings , we recover all of the pseudoknot reidemeister moves , with the notable exception of the pseudo - reidemeister i ( pr1 ) move .",
    ", width=556 ]    we note that the pr1 move ought to be included for the following reason .",
    "consider a pseudodiagram @xmath1 and the pseudodiagram @xmath2 that is related to @xmath1 by a pr1 move that introduces a new precrossing , @xmath3 . given a resolution of the precrossings in @xmath2 , the canonical corresponding resolution of the precrossings in @xmath1 produces the same knot type , regardless of how @xmath3 was resolved in @xmath2 .",
    "so , in an important sense , pr1 preserves the knot type of a pseudodiagram .",
    "now that we have defined pseudodiagrams , we d like to learn what we can about their classification .",
    "we d also like to extend several classical knot theoretical notions to our new setting . in section",
    "[ were ] , we introduce the primary invariant we use to classify pseudoknots , and in section  [ families ] , we discuss the classification of several pseudoknot families .",
    "we then turn to the extension of the crossing number in section  [ crossnum ] .",
    "section  [ hom ] is concerned with the homtopy of pseudoknots , and we propose a notion of chirality in section  [ chiral ] .",
    "we conclude with a few open questions and provide an appendix for tables of pseudoknots with up to five crossings .",
    "as with any knot theory , the primary question in pseudoknot theory asks how we might classify pseudoknots .",
    "that is , given any two distinct pseudoknots , how might we prove that they are distinct .",
    "one partial answer is to consider the set of all possible knots that can be produced by resolving all precrossings in a diagram of the pseudoknot .",
    "a more sophisticated answer is to consider the invariant we call the _ weighted resolution set _ of a pseudoknot .",
    "the _ weighted resolution set _ ( or _ were - set _ ) of a pseudoknot @xmath1 is the set of ordered pairs @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a resolution of @xmath1 ( i.e. a choice of crossing information for every precrossing ) and @xmath6 is the probability that @xmath5 is obtained from @xmath1 by a random choice of crossing information , assuming that positive and negative crossings are equally likely .    to illustrate this definition ,",
    "consider the pseudoknot @xmath7 in figure  [ part_tref ] .",
    "there are @xmath8 ways to resolve the precrossings in the diagram .",
    "three of the four resolutions result in the unknot , @xmath9 , while one resolution results in the trefoil , @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the were - set for this example is @xmath11 .",
    "note that if we resolve one of the precrossings of @xmath7 to be a positive crossing , the were - set of the resulting pseudoknot is @xmath12 .",
    "this shows that the were - set is indeed a more powerful invariant than the ( unweighted ) resolution set , as the added probabilities can distinguish these two pseudoknots .",
    ", that produces the unknot and the trefoil .",
    "[ part_tref],width=96 ]    the were - set is an invariant of pseudoknots .",
    "it suffices to show that the were - set of a pseudoknot is unchanged by the pseudo - reidemeister moves .",
    "we will in fact show that all moves except the pr1 move preserve the resolution multiset ( i.e. the set of knots obtained by resolving precrossings in all possible ways , with multiplicity ) .",
    "therefore , they preserve the were - set .",
    "first , all classical reidemeister moves clearly preserve the resolution multiset since they involve no precrossings .",
    "the two pr3 moves behave much like the classical moves . regardless of",
    "which resolution is chosen for the single precrossing , a classical r3 move is possible on the resolution , so the knot type is unchanged .",
    "thus the were - set is also unchanged .    for pr2",
    ", we note that , both before and after the move , there are two possibilities for the precrossing resolution of the pseudoknot . in each case",
    ", there is precisely one precrossing resolution that yields alternating crossings while the other yields a local diagram that r2 may be applied to .",
    "the alternating resolution that is obtained before the move is identical to the one obtained after the move .",
    "thus , the knot types for this choice of resolution before and after the move are identical .",
    "the non - alternating choice of resolution also produces the same knot both before and after the pr2 move because a simplifying r2 move is possible in each case .",
    "it follows that the resolution multiset is unaffected by the pr2 move , and thus so is the were - set .    finally , we consider the pr1 move .",
    "we note that either resolution of the precrossing can be removed with a simplifying classical r1 move , so this move does not change the knot type of any resolution .",
    "since we have two choices for the precrossing in pr1 , the multiplicity of every resolution is increased by a factor of two after the move that adds a precrossing is performed . since doubling the multiplicity of each knot in the resolution multiset does not affect the ratios of the resolutions , the were - set is unchanged .",
    "to help us understand the relationship between pseudoknots and their were - sets , we compute the were - sets for the shadows of various families of knots . note that whenever we refer to such a shadow , we are considering the pseudoknot associated to a shadow of the standard projection of the knot .",
    "we begin by considering torus knots , with a focus on @xmath13-torus knots .",
    "a @xmath13-torus knot is particularly straightforward to analyze since it is the closure of a @xmath14-braid ( i.e. a braid with two strands ) that has an odd number of crossings .",
    "( recall that the closure of a @xmath14-braid with an even number of crossings produces a link . ) to determine the resolutions of a @xmath13-torus shadow , it suffices to consider the shadow of its corresponding @xmath14-braid .",
    "it is well known that braids can be represented by elements of a group called the _ braid group _  @xcite .",
    "for example , a @xmath14-braid can be represented by a word in the generators @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath15 represents a negative crossing between the two strands and @xmath16 represents a positive crossing .",
    "( note that the fact that these generators are inverses follows from the r2 move . )",
    "all resolutions of the shadow of a @xmath14-braid , therefore , correspond to powers of @xmath15 .",
    "this leads us to the following result .",
    "suppose @xmath17 is the shadow of a @xmath14-braid with @xmath18 crossings .",
    "then there are @xmath19 ways to resolve the precrossings to obtain the braid @xmath20 . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath21 is a pseudodiagram of a @xmath14-braid with @xmath18 precrossings and the classical crossings contribute a total of @xmath22 to the braid word for @xmath21 , then there are @xmath23 ways to resolve @xmath21 to get a braid with reduced word @xmath24 .",
    "[ braid ]    if we choose @xmath25 of the @xmath18 crossings to be negative ( corresponding to @xmath15 ) and @xmath26 to be positive ( corresponding to @xmath16 ) , then the reduced braid word corresponding to the resulting braid is @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , there are @xmath19 ways to choose the @xmath26 positive crossings .",
    "the second statement follows as an immediate corollary .",
    "every resolution of the shadow of a @xmath13-torus knot is a @xmath27-torus knot , with @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , there are @xmath29 ways to obtain a @xmath27 torus knot from the @xmath13-torus shadow . in particular , since the unknot is its own mirror image ( as it can be represented both as a @xmath30- and @xmath31-torus shadow ) , there are @xmath32 ways to get the unknot .",
    "[ 2ptorus ]    a @xmath13-torus knot is the closure of the 2-braid with @xmath33 crossings corresponding to the braid word @xmath34 . by the previous lemma",
    ", there are @xmath35 ways to get the braid @xmath36 from the shadow of the 2-braid with @xmath33 crossings , and the closures of these braids are precisely the @xmath27-torus knots . clearly , no other knot types are obtainable from the standard projection , since every resolution is the closure of a @xmath14-braid .",
    "the knotting number of the shadow of a @xmath13-torus knot is equal to @xmath37 .",
    "any crossing can be removed by a suitable resolution of an adjacent precrossing .",
    "so if we have chosen @xmath26 crossings ( say , positively ) and have @xmath38 left to choose , the difference must be at least @xmath39 to ensure that a nontrivial knot is produced .",
    "if we let @xmath40 , then @xmath41 this is the least number of crossing choices we can make to be sure we have a knot .    while the were - sets of @xmath13-torus knot shadows are straightforward to describe , other kinds of torus knot shadows present more of a challenge",
    ". one interesting feature of the @xmath13-torus knots is that every resolution is itself a @xmath13-torus knot for some @xmath33 . for the @xmath42-torus shadow",
    ", however , a similar result fails to hold .",
    "the were - set of the shadow of the ( 3,4)-torus knot is    @xmath43    we note that it contains knots which are not torus knots .",
    "the @xmath44-torus knot is also of particular interest .    the probability of obtaining an unknot from a knot shadow is higher than the probability of obtaining any other knot type for shadows with up to 12 crossings .",

    "just as with classical knots , we have a natural notion of crossing number for pseudoknots , as follows .",
    "the _ crossing number _ , @xmath99 , of a pseudoknot @xmath5 is the minimum number of total crossings ( both classical and precrossings ) of any projection of that pseudoknot .    given this definition , one natural question that arises is the following .",

    "equivalently , if it is possible to reduce any resolution of a pseudoknot , is it necessarily possible to reduce the pseudoknot ? + using the were - set invariant , we are able to answer this question negatively . indeed , there are pseudoknots with crossing number strictly greater than the maximum of the crossing numbers of knots in the resolution set .",

    "on the other hand , there is a nice class of examples for which our question can be answered positively .",
    "first , some terminology is needed .",
    "a crossing in a pseudodiagram is called _ nugatory _ if there exists a circle in the plane enclosing part of the knot which intersects the knot at the crossing and nowhere else .",

    "in our example @xmath100 , we saw that if crossing @xmath76 is resolved one way , the knot @xmath91 results . if the crossing is resolved the other way , we get the knot @xmath105 .",
    "an interesting question to consider is whether there is a similar example of a pseudodiagram with a single non - nugatory precrossing such that both resolutions produce the same knot rather than two different knots ( so the were - set has a single element ) .",
    "in fact , the rational knot @xmath106 is such an example for _ unoriented _ pseudoknots",
    ". both resolutions of the precrossing yield the knot @xmath107 .",
    "the precrossing in a pseudodiagram with this curious property are called _ cosmetic _ or ( non - nugatory ) _ degenerate _ crossings .",

    "this problem was first posed by x .- s .",
    "lin and appears as problem 1.58 in rob kirby s problem list .",
    "in this section , we consider more broadly the relationship between pseudoknots that is generated by crossing changes .",
    "two pseudoknots are called _ homotopic _ , or _ crossing - change equivalent _ , if their pseudodiagrams can be related by sequences of crossing changes and pseudo - reidemeister moves .    in the case of classical knots ,",
    "the notion of homotopy is uninteresting .",
    "indeed , every classical knot is homotopic to the unknot . the notion of homotopy for pseudoknots ,",

    "while there exist homotopically nontrivial pseudoknots , the following result gives a large class of pseudoknots which remain homotopic to the unknot .",
    "every pseudoknot that can be represented by a pseudodiagram with a single precrossing is homotopic to the unknot .",
    "first , recall that a knot diagram is _ based _ if a base point ( different from the crossing points ) is specified on the diagram , and _ oriented _ if an orientation is assigned to it .",
    "let @xmath5 be a knot and @xmath108 be a based oriented diagram of @xmath5 .",

    "note that @xmath109 is the diagram of a trivial knot .",

    "the @xmath139-unknotting number is @xmath140 while the unknotting numbers of both resolutions are 1 .",
    "in the previous sections , we used the were - set as our primary invariant for distinguishing pseudoknots .",
    "in fact , there is a stronger version of the were - set that remains invariant .",
    "the _ signed weighted resolution set _ of a pseudoknot is a were - set where distinctions are made between resolutions and their mirror images . while theorem  [ 2ptorus ] is in fact a result about signed were - sets",
    ", we have not often made the distinction between a knots and their mirror images .",
    "the following example illustrates how this distinction can be useful .",
    "consider the standard trefoil shadow , @xmath141 .",
    "the were - set of this pseudoknot is @xmath142 ( where @xmath10 may denote both the right- and the left - handed trefoils ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the trefoil with two precrossings and a positive crossing , @xmath143 , has the same were - set , despite the fact that the left - handed trefoil , @xmath144 , is not a possible resolution of @xmath143 but is a possible resolution of @xmath141 .",
    "indeed , the signed were - set of @xmath143 is @xmath145 , where @xmath146 emphasizes that the resolution is the right - handed trefoil .",
    "of course , @xmath144 is in the ( signed ) were set , @xmath147 , of @xmath141 .",
    "so we see that the signed were - set can distinguish these two pseudoknots .",
    "there are other interesting examples of pseudoknots with the same were - sets but different signed were - sets .",
    "for instance , the pseudoknots @xmath148 and @xmath149 have the same were - set @xmath150 . however , their signed were - sets are @xmath151 and @xmath150 respectively .",
    "when we begin to make distinctions between knots and their mirror images , it is natural to ask questions regarding which knots are equivalent to their mirror images , i.e. which knots are _ amphicheiral_. the mirror image @xmath152 of a pseudodiagram @xmath153 is the diagram obtained from @xmath153 by making all positive crossings negative and vice versa , leaving all precrossings untouched .",
    "two pseudoknots are mirror images of one another if thy have pseudodiagrams that are mirror images . given this notion of mirror image for pseudoknots , we introduce the related notion of amphicheirality for pseudoknots .    a pseudoknot @xmath5 is called _ amphicheiral _ if @xmath5 and its mirror image @xmath154 are ambient isotopic .    in order to recognize amphicheiral pseudoknots we can use signed were - sets , where to an amphicheiral pseudoknot @xmath5 and its mirror image @xmath154 correspond the same signed were - sets .    in order to construct an infinite number of amphicheiral rational pseudoknots with one or two precrossings",
    ", we can use the following two theorems for classical knots :    a rational knot is amphicheiral _ iff _ its conway symbol is mirror - symmetric and has an even number of crossings .    every rational unknotting number 1 knot can be expressed by one of the following conway symbols @xmath155 @xmath156 where @xmath157 for @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "the knot family @xmath160 ( @xmath93 ) , which includes knots @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163,@xmath164 , satisfies the criteria of both theorems and consists of amphicheiral rational knots with unknotting number 1 .",
    "if we substitute a crossing @xmath74 by a precrossing in any knot in this family , we obtain the family of pseudoknots @xmath165 ( pictured in fig . [ f10]a ) .",
    "the resolutions of this pseudoknot are the unknot and knot @xmath160 , which are both amphicheiral .",
    "thus , all pseudoknots @xmath165 are amphicheiral .    from this same knot family",
    ", we derive the family of amphicheiral pseudoknots @xmath166 with two precrossings .",
    "indeed , we notice that its resolutions are the amphicheiral knots @xmath160 , the unknots @xmath167 and @xmath168 , and the amphicheiral knot @xmath169 ( see fig . [ f10]b ) .    ;",
    "( b ) @xmath166 .",
    "[ f10],width=364 ]",
    "while we have alluded to several open questions throughout our paper , we conclude with several more interesting questions about pseudoknots .",
    "* question 1 : * is each pseudoknot uniquely determined by its signed were - set ?    * question 2 : * do flypes involving nugatory precrossings preserve pseudoknot type ?    *",
    "question 3 : * earlier , we considered shadows of @xmath14-braids . what is an appropriate definition , in general , of pseudobraids ?",
    "in particular , when are two pseudobraids equivalent ? furthermore , in classical braid theory there are markov moves that characterize when two braids have equivalent closures .",
    "is there an analog for pseudobraids ?",
    "knot tables of prime pseudoknots with at most 9 crossings are based on the computation of their were - sets .",
    "the number of obtained pseudoknots is given in the following table :          we are grateful to jim morrow and the nsf for allowing us to work on this research as a part of the university of washington reu .",
    "we also wish to acknowledge seattle university for summer research support .",

    "it is also a pleasure express our gratitude to lena folwaczny for pointing out the history of the cosmetic crossing problem and to roger fenn for sparking our interest in this problem .",
