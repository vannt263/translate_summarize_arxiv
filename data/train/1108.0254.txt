    "the electron  impact ionization processes play a crucial role in the physics of the high atmospherical layers , astrophysics , radiation damage of biological objects , and controlled fusion facility operation . that is why these processes remain a subject of researchers interest for long time ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "our pa results coincide with the experimental ones better than those of m3dw - oamo both in the binary peaks position and in the recoil peaks magnitude , though the recoil peak is slightly underestimated in our results at @xmath144 ev .",
    "the ecs-2bd results @xcite coincide well in magnitude with the pa results , but demonstrate strong underestimation of the angular shift with respect to the direction of the momentum transfer vector @xmath28 .",
    "the ecs-2bd method takes into consideration only the second  order born term bi ",
    "dipole component , i.e. the contribution to the second  order born term that is linear with respect to both radius  vectors of two target electrons .",
    "the hartee ",
    "fock approximation is considered here taking into account interaction of only one target electron with scattered electron but exactly .",
    "hence one can conclude that the main contribution to the angular shift is given by the second born term components which depend only on the coordinates of one electron .",
    "this can explain the failure of the ecs-2bd in describing of the angular distribution of ejected electrons in the h@xmath0 double ionization @xcite .     + ( a ) +   + ( b ) +    we calculated the tdcs for a non - aligned n@xmath0 molecule at the experimental parameters @xcite .",
    "the variational functions @xcite were used as the functions of initial states of n@xmath0 orbitals . in fig.[figsigma2sg ] we show the pa and pa1b results together with the experimental data @xcite , and also the tcc-1b results @xcite for the ionization of an electron from an inner @xmath147 shell of n@xmath0 . since the pa1b result is much closer to the experimental data than that of pa , the experimental data and the tcc-1b results are normalized to fit the pa1b .",
    "we suppose that such a discouraging pa failure is caused by using the approximation of one active electron and , as a consequence , with neglecting the target interelectron correlation and the change of the rest electrons state during the interaction with the incoming electron . in the first born model",
    ", the target electron acquires the escape velocity after a single act of momentum transfer from the incident electron and rapidly leaves the molecule , so , other electrons have no time to change their state and the frozen core approximation is correct .",
    "high - order born terms include two - step processes : after the first momentum transfer the electron can stay in the excited state ( note , that it is most probable for initially strongly bound internal electrons ) and leave the molecule only after the second momentum transfer .",
    "certainly , during the first stage the other electron has time to change its state .",
    "since the interelectron correlation leads to the growth of the average interelectron distance , it should obviously lead to a decrease of the repulsion of the ejected electron from the other target electrons in comparison with the frozen core approximation .",
    "so , in the intermediate state of a two - step process , the active electron is actually stronger bound with the molecule then in the frozen core approximation and has less chance to leave the molecule after the second impact . as result ,",
    "the ionization via two - step processes is strongly overestimated when using the frozen core approximation . in pa1b",
    "the two - step processes are omitted , while in pa with frozen core they are present and strongly overestimated .",
    "apparently , that is why the pa1b turned out to be much closer to the experimental data than the pa .",
    "+ ( a ) +   + ( b ) +    in fig.[figsigmasum ] the same as in fig.[figsigma2sg ] is shown , but for the outer shells ionization .",
    "we calculated the contributions to the tdcs given by the ionization from @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150shells of n@xmath0 , and summarized them with the coefficients 1 , 0.78 , and 0.32 respectively , following @xcite . here the experimental data and the tcc-1b data are rescaled to fit the pa binary peak value . in this case",
    "our pa results are obviously closer to the experimental points than those of the pa1b and the tcc-1b , though the pa notably underestimates the recoil peak value at @xmath144 ev and the angular shift of the binary peak at @xmath145 ev .",
    "these distinctions seem to be associated with the target outer shells dynamics .",
    "+ ( a ) +   + ( b ) +   + ( c ) +    also we calculated the tdcs of the ionization of aligned h@xmath0 for the following experimental parameters @xcite : the energy of impact electron @xmath151 ev , the scattering angle @xmath152 , and the ejected electron energy @xmath153 ev ( fig .",
    "[ figsigmah2aligned ] ) .",
    "since the incoming electron momentum @xmath154 is rather small and the scattering angle is large , it can be considered as a rigorous test of the paraxial approximation applicability limits .",
    "the initial orientation of the molecule in @xcite was measured by registering the protons that appear due to the dissociation of the residual h@xmath2 ion . since the dominant channel of this process is ground - state dissociation , we used the internuclear distance @xmath155 a.u . for h@xmath0 , when this process is possible .",
    "[ figsigmah2aligned ] , beside our pa results and the experimental data @xcite , also demonstrates the molecular three - body distorted wave ( m3bdw ) results and the three - coulomb wavefunction approach for the helium target multiplied by the interference factor ( 3caif ) results from @xcite .",
    "the experimental data are normalized to binary peak magnitude in our pa @xmath155 curve for @xmath156=45@xmath157 .",
    "it is seen that our method yields the values of binary to recoil peak magnitudes ratio closest to the experimental one compared with other theoretical methods .",
    "the distinctions from the experiment may be a consequence of neglecting the ionization ",
    "dissociation via autoionizing states in our method , whereas this process gives a significant contribution to the ionization dissociation of the h@xmath0 molecule .",
    "we have calculated the tdcs of the intermediate  energy electron ionization of the helium atom , the hydrogen molecule , and the nitrogen molecule using the method based on the paraxial approximation for the incoming electron and the time - dependent hartree - fock method with frozen core for the target electrons .",
    "the comparison with experimental data shows that this method works very well both for helium and h@xmath0 , and quite well for n@xmath0 in the case of electron ejection from outer shells . for inner @xmath147 shell of n@xmath0",
    "the agreement is good for the pa1b , but worse for pure pa , apparently because of the insufficiency of the frozen core approximation .",
    "in contrast to original scattering problem , pa can be easy combined , for instance , with time - dependent density functional method allows to calculate a evolution of all electronic orbitals with an approximate account of a interelectronic interaction with an acceptable cost of computer resources .",
    "so , we plan to develop pa approach on this way .",
    "we also plan to use the method ( in its present form ) to study the dependence of the mdcs on the projectile charge sign .",

    "<S> we have implemented the paraxial approximation followed by the time - dependent hartree - fock method with frozen core for the single impact ionization of atoms and two - atomic molecules . </S>",
    "<S> it reduces the original scattering problem to the solution of a five - dimensional time - dependent schrdinger equation . using this method we calculated the multi - fold differential cross section of the impact single ionization of the helium atom , the hydrogen molecule and the nitrogen molecule by the impact of an intermediate  energy electrons . </S>",
    "<S> our results for the he and the h@xmath0 are quite close to the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , for n@xmath0 the agreement is good for the paraxial approximation combined with first born approximation , but worse for pure paraxial approximation , apparently because of the insufficiency of the frozen core approximation . </S>"
