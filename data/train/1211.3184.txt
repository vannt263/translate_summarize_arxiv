    "one can define differential forms in this context in the usual way by defining them on each local uniformizing chart . in this fashion",
    ", it can be shown that all the usual theory of differential forms , including de rham cohomology and poincar duality carries over to the smooth orbifold case .",

    "notice that this action is free away from the origin and has an isolated fixed point at the origin .",
    "the above definitions are much simpler than the general definitions of an orbifold and an orbifold singularity . by the standard terminology , the above would be considered an isolated orbifold singularity . in general",
