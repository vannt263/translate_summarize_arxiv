    "interpretation of these volume - averaged quantities remains difficult , in part because the earliest phases of galaxy formation are poorly understood .",
    "age determinations for galaxies at intermediate and high redshift provide an accurate clock for galaxy formation at early times .",
    "application of this technique has been hampered by the small samples of suitable galaxies at appropriate redshifts , and the difficulty of obtaining reliable age estimates from low signal - to - noise spectra .",
    "age determinations for the prototypical evolved red galaxy , 53w091 , range from @xmath13  gyr ( dunlop et al . 1999 ; nolan et al .",
    "2001 ) to as young as @xmath14  gyr ( bruzual & magris 1997 ; yi et al . 2000 ) .",
    "visible - light surveys of galaxies at @xmath15 are biased against inclusion of red galaxies and hence are limited in their ability to shed light on the formation of the oldest and most massive galaxies .",
    "near - ir surveys of galaxies with red optical - to - ir colors provide the requisite samples of massive galaxies at redshifts that constrain the formation epoch .",
    "most spectroscopic studies of the red @xmath16 or @xmath17 population to date ( e.g. cimatti et al .",
    "2002 ; yan et al .",
    "2004 ) , have not revealed signatures of evolved populations at z @xmath18 due to observational limitations . at higher redshifts",
    "the strong signatures of older stellar populations ( e.g. , 4000   break and caii h&k lines ) are beyond the reach of most ccd - based spectrographs . at z @xmath19 ,",
    "strong uv resonance lines are redshifted into the atmospheric passband , allowing identification of uv - bright galaxies . in the intermediate regime , @xmath20 , evolved galaxies must be probed with weak photospheric features of mgii , mgi and feii .    the red galaxy population ( e.g. @xmath21 ) is a mix of evolved and reddened star forming systems .",
    "estimates of the fraction of star forming galaxies in this population range from 20 - 60% ( e.g. cimatti et al .",
    "2002 ; smail et al .",
    "2002 ; yan et al . 2004 ) .",
    "although the @xmath22 red @xmath23 selected galaxy population ( e.g. franx et al . 2003 ) likely contains evolved objects , those with confirmed redshifts all have strong star formation signatures in their rest - uv spectra ( van dokkum et al . 2003 ) , possibly due to observational limitations .",
    "similarly , the massive k - bright galaxies at @xmath24 from the goods and k20 surveys ( daddi et al . 2004 ) have high inferred star formation rates .",
    "the gemini deep deep survey ( gdds : abraham et al .",
    "2004 , hereafter paper i ) , was the first to identify evolved galaxies at @xmath1 in significant numbers ( also see cimatti et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the gdds is a spectroscopic study of galaxies in the @xmath10 range within four separate areas of the las campanas ir survey ( mccarthy et al .",
    "2001 ) . very long exposures , using the ` nod & shuffle ' sky cancellation technique yielded high quality spectra from which redshifts could be derived for 272 galaxies with @xmath25 ( vega ) . catalogs , field locations , mask design , and sample selection",
    "are given in paper i. twenty gdds galaxies with @xmath26 display clear signatures of old stellar populations .",
    "in this paper we present spectra of these galaxies along with preliminary age determinations and consider the implications of these results for our understanding of the formation of massive galaxies .",
    "the sample of 20 gdds galaxies with @xmath28 with spectra characteristic of old populations is listed in table  1 .",
    "the object designation is given in the first column , followed by the redshift .",
    "confidence classes and spectral classifications are given in paper i. high confidence redshifts were determined for 71% ( 75/105 ) of the @xmath29 galaxies and 67% ( 35/52 ) of the @xmath30 subsample .",
    "these two samples span the redshift range from 0.8 - 2.1 . among objects with spectroscopic redshifts ,",
    "51% of the @xmath29 sample have unambiguous old stellar components .",
    "the redder galaxies ( @xmath30 ) show an even greater preponderance for pure - old spectra with 72% having significant old populations . about half of the objects with @xmath29 and @xmath27 have old spectra , while 80% of the objects with @xmath30 and @xmath27 have old spectral classifications . _",
    "thus 50 - 80% of the @xmath26 red gdds sample show spectra with contributions from old stellar populations_. the contribution of old stars in our @xmath27 sample is similar to that seen in the @xmath31 samples ( e.g. , cimatti et al .",

    "figures  1 and 2 convey the key result presented in this paper : there is a significant population of color - selected luminous field galaxies at @xmath20 with spectra dominated by old stars .",
    "unlike radio - selected evolved galaxies at @xmath46 previously reported ( e.g. dunlop et al .",
    "1996 ) , our objects have a high surface density on the sky ( @xmath2 sq .",
    "arcmin@xmath3 ) .",
    "the existence of massive galaxies at redshifts up to @xmath24 with evolved spectra argues for an early formation episode and strains semi - analytic cdm models ( e.g. cole et al .",
    "2000 ; baugh et al .",
    "2003 ) . the most successful models ( somerville et al .",
    "2004 ) can produce sufficiently massive galaxies at early epochs , but still have difficulties in producing red and old galaxies at @xmath47 .",
    "the critical empirical issue is understanding the age of the stellar populations , and hence the formation redshifts , in the old red galaxies at the highest redshifts possible .",
    "we made a preliminary attempt to derive very conservative ( i.e. minimum ) ages for the galaxies listed in table  1 by making use of both the information in the spectra and @xmath48 photometry .",
    "for each galaxy , we systematically compared the observed sed with a set of synthetic spectra computed with pgase.2 ( fioc & rocca - volmerange 1997 ) and constructed a multi - dimensional @xmath49 surface spanning a wide range of star - formation histories , ages , extinction ( a@xmath50 ) and metallicities .",
    "the observed sed of each galaxy comprises a flux - calibrated gdds spectrum and a broad - band spectral energy distribution combined with weights assigned in proportion to the band - width of the observations . in most cases",
    "the spectra and broad - band photometry carry nearly equal weight .",
    "all the models use a salpeter ( 1955 ) imf with an upper - mass cutoff of 120m@xmath51 .",

    "instantaneous - burst models with 12  metallicities ranging from 20% to 175% of solar were considered , together with exponentially declining star formation histories with 10  e - folding times ranging between 0.1  gyr and 3  gyr .    from the @xmath49 surface , a best - fit age , star formation history , metallicity and extinction were derived .",
    "the range of acceptable ages for a given galaxy was limited by the age of the universe at its observed redshift .",
    "statistical uncertainties on the age were computed from the set of models satisfying @xmath53 .",
    "an extensive description of the underlying models and our approach to fitting data to these will be given in le borgne et al .",

    "we summarize the results of our age determination analysis using the pgase.2 models in table  1 . in column 6 of table  1",
    "we list the best - fit ages and the range of acceptable ages .",
    "bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) instantaneous - burst models yield best fits with age differences smaller than 0.2  gyr .",
    "columns 7 through 11 give the e - folding time , a@xmath54 , abundance , @xmath49 value and formation redshift for the best - fitting models , respectively .",
    "the reduced @xmath49 values exceed unity , in part , because of imperfections in the model spectral libraries .",
    "the formation redshifts are determined from the redshift of observation , the best - fit age and the age of the universe in a @xmath55  km s@xmath35mpc@xmath35 cosmology . in nearly all cases",
    "the best fits were achieved with either an instantaneous burst or a short e - folding time exponential burst ( @xmath56  gyr ) , with a preponderance favoring the instantaneous - burst models .",
    "the single - burst and exponential model fits generally favor metallicities higher than 50% solar .",
    "super solar metallicities reduced the @xmath49 values in @xmath57% of the cases .",
    "we truncated our metallicity search space at [ fe / h]@xmath58 .",
    "while large values are seen in the cores of local ellipticals ( e.g. thomas et al . 2003 ) , the large apertures of our spectroscopic and photometric measurements ( @xmath59kpc diameter ) and the abundance gradients seen in ellipticals produce luminosity weighted abundances within our apertures that are closer to solar ( see jrgensen et al . 1997 ; arimoto et al .",
    "for the four objects that favor models with [ fe / h]@xmath60 , fits with the metallicity capped at the solar value yield best - fit ages that are 0.5 - 1.0  gyr older than those listed in table  1 .",
    "we have measured the mass - density in high - mass objects and determined the contribution from the @xmath61 objects using the procedures from paper iii .",

    "limiting the models to [ fe / h ] @xmath7 shifts the inferred median age and @xmath8 to 2.3  gyr and 3.2 , respectively ; imposing a@xmath50 = 0 in addition yields a median @xmath8 of 4.0 .",
    "the spectra of the red gdds galaxies reveal unambiguous evidence for old and metal - rich galaxies over the full range from @xmath10 .",
    "our preliminary , conservative analysis implies early and rapid formation for a substantial fraction of these . the median @xmath68 , age , @xmath8 , and mass for the sample in table  1 are 1.49 , 1.5  gyr , 2.5 , and @xmath69  m@xmath51 , respectively .",

    "more plausible models , those with star formation extended over one or more dynamical times , produce best - fitting ages that are typically @xmath70  gyr @xmath71 than those in table  1 , implying @xmath72 for a substantial fraction of the galaxies .    taking the @xmath8 in table  1 as indicative of the onset of star formation",
    ", the `` median '' red galaxy requires a constant star formation rate of 50  m@xmath51 yr@xmath35 over the full 1.5  gyr period from @xmath73 to @xmath74 to produce the required stellar mass .",
    "these rates are higher than that of a typical lyman break galaxy ( lbg ) at @xmath12 ( e.g. shapley et al . 2003 ) . constant star formation rate models , however , reproduce neither the colors nor the spectra of the red galaxies .",
    "star formation with an e - folding time of @xmath66  yr implies peak sfrs @xmath75  m@xmath51yr@xmath35 at @xmath76 in the most massive galaxies .",
    "these high star formation rates , coupled with the strong clustering of the red galaxy population ( e.g. mccarthy et al . 2001 ) and the differences in stellar mass , suggest that these objects are probably not closely connected with the @xmath77 lyman - break galaxy population .",
    "assembly of the massive gdds galaxies from many sub - units still requires early , and short - lived , star formation , although the units could be smaller than the typical @xmath78m@xmath51 of the gdds galaxies .",
    "while star formation in smaller sub - galactic units will proceed with shorter dynamical times , the best - fitting instantaneous burst ( or even @xmath79  gyr ) models imply impressive synchronization in the truncation of star formation among the precursors .",
    "the near - solar metallicities required to fit the strong uv stellar lines and the favored single - burst models naively argue for a single massive star formation episode ( per galaxy ) at @xmath80 as the simplest formation scenario .",
    "it appears that there is a continuous coeval population of massive red galaxies that are traced , in order of decreasing redshift , by : @xmath22 red @xmath23 galaxies , red gdds galaxies at @xmath81 and the classical `` eros '' at @xmath82 observed in the k20 , lcir and other surveys .",
    "these all point to an early formation epoch for the progenitors of present day massive galaxies .",
    "our analysis implies high peak star formation rates at @xmath83 . at present",
    "the only candidates for such rapidly forming massive galaxies at high redshift are the sub - mm luminous sources .",
    "the median redshift ( @xmath84 ) for the bright scuba sources ( chapman et al .",
    "2003 ) is indistinguishable from our current conservative @xmath85 estimate for the red gdds galaxies . a significant fraction of the gdds galaxies , however , appear to have formation redshifts outside the range of known scuba redshifts .",
