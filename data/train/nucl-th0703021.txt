    "the concepts of charge independence and charge symmetry provide powerful tools in organizing the multiplet structure of systems of hadrons and nuclei .",
    "these symmetries are not perfect ; diverse small but interesting violations have been discovered ; see the reviews of refs .",
    "our concern here is with charge symmetry breaking .",
    "hadronic states can be regarded as approximately charge symmetric , i.e.  invariant under a rotation by @xmath4 around the 2-axis in isospin space .",
    "charge symmetry  ( cs ) is a subset of the general isospin symmetry , charge independence  ( ci ) , which requires invariance under _ any _ rotation in isospin space . in quantum chromodynamics  ( qcd )",
    ", cs requires that the dynamics are unchanged under the exchange of the up and down quarks  @xcite . in the language of hadrons",
    ", this symmetry translates into e.g.  the invariance of the strong interaction under the exchange of protons and neutrons .",
    "however , since the up and down quarks do have different masses  ( @xmath5 )  @xcite , the qcd lagrangian is not charge symmetric and neither are the strong interactions of hadrons .",
    "this symmetry violation is called charge symmetry breaking  ( csb ) .",
    "the different electromagnetic interactions of the up and down quarks also contribute to csb .    observing the effects of csb interactions",
    "therefore provides a probe of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which are fundamental , but poorly known , parameters of the standard model .",
    "for example , the light quark mass difference causes the neutron to be heavier than the proton .",
    "if this were not the case , our universe would be very different , as a consequence of the dependence of big - bang nucleosynthesis on the relative abundances of protons and neutrons . experimental evidence for csb",
    "has been demonstrated many times , see e.g. refs .",
    "two exciting recent observations of csb in experiments involving the production of neutral pions have stimulated current interest : many years of effort led to the observation of csb in @xmath8 at triumf . after a careful treatment of systematic errors , the csb forward - backward asymmetry of the differential cross section",
    "was found to be @xmath9  @xcite , where the former error is statistical and the latter systematical .",
    "in addition , the final experiment at the iucf cooler ring has reported a very convincing @xmath10 signal near threshold ( @xmath11  pb at @xmath12  mev and @xmath13  pb at @xmath14  mev )  @xcite .",
    "these data are consistent with the pion being produced in an @xmath15-wave , as expected from the proximity of the threshold ( @xmath16  mev )",
    ". studies of the @xmath10 reaction thus present exciting new opportunities for developing the understanding of csb .",
    "the reaction @xmath10 obviously violates isospin conservation , but more specifically , it violates charge symmetry since the deuterons and the @xmath2-particle are self - conjugate under the charge - symmetry operator , with a positive eigenvalue , while the neutral pion wave function changes sign .",
    "this reaction could thus not occur if charge symmetry were conserved , and its cross section is proportional to the square of the csb amplitude .",
    "this phenomenon is unique , because all other observations of csb involve interferences with charge - symmetric amplitudes .    due to the recent availability of high - quality experimental data on csb , a theoretical interpretation using fundamental csb mechanisms",
    "is called for . at momenta",
    "comparable to the pion mass , @xmath17 , qcd and its symmetries ( and in particular csb ) can be described by a hadronic effective field theory  ( eft ) , called chiral perturbation theory  ( @xmath18pt ) , for extensive reviews see refs .",
    "this eft has been extended to pion production in refs .",
    "@xcite where typical momenta are @xmath19 , with @xmath20 as the nucleon mass ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite where pion production was studied neglecting this large momentum in power counting ) .",
    "the eft formalism provides specific csb effects in addition to the nucleon mass difference .",
    "in particular , there are two pion - nucleon seagull interactions related by chiral symmetry to the quark - mass and electromagnetic contributions to the nucleon mass difference  @xcite .    in previous work  @xcite , the cross section for the reaction @xmath10 was computed near threshold by chiral eft techniques , using a chiral power counting scheme to assess the expected importance of different interaction terms .",
    "the first paper  @xcite used a plane wave approximation along with gaussian bound - state wave functions .",
    "these initial calculations yielded computed cross sections that are a factor of @xmath21 larger than the measured ones .",
    "the effects of initial - state interactions and realistic bound - state wave functions were included later  @xcite , with resulting cross sections of the order of several hundred pb or more .",
    "it is thus clear that more work is needed to understand the order of magnitude of the measured cross section , such as a treatment of the effects of loop diagrams along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we consider here one specific contribution that has previously been neglected  the influence of the coulomb interaction in the initial state .",
    "the formalism employed is similar to that of ref .",
    "the main objective is to assess the relevance of this mechanism , so we use simple bound - state wave functions and neglect the effects of strong interactions in the initial state .",
    "it is worthwhile to explain some basic features of the calculation that result from invariance principles : spin , isospin , and symmetry requirements restrict the partial waves allowed for the @xmath10 reaction . in the spectroscopic notation @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are , respectively",
    ", the spin , orbital , and total angular momenta of the @xmath3 state , and @xmath25 denotes the pion angular momentum , the lowest allowed partial waves are @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "hence , production of an @xmath15-wave pion requires that the initial deuterons be in a relative @xmath28-wave , with spins coupled to a spin-1 state , forming together a state with zero total angular momentum . on the other hand ,",
    "a @xmath29-wave pion is produced only when the deuterons are in a relative @xmath30-wave , with spins maximally aligned to spin 2 , requiring either a coupling with @xmath31 or @xmath30-states of @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "interferences between @xmath15- and @xmath29-waves disappear for any unpolarized observable .",
    "we shall therefore be concerned with the production of an @xmath15-wave pion . in the mechanism proposed here",
    ", the coulomb interaction between the two protons of different deuterons converts the initial relative @xmath28-wave state into an @xmath32-wave state .",
    "parity conservation then requires that one of the resulting pairs of nucleons be in a @xmath29-wave with orbital angular momentum unity .",
    "the strong pseudovector pion production operator then converts this @xmath29-wave state into an @xmath15-wave state .",
