    "the expansion history of the universe are presently studied with a few observational probes , such as the supernova ia , baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) , weak gravitational lensing , and galaxy clusters , etc .",
    "each of these probes has its pros and cons , and suffer from different systematic uncertainties ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a new observational probe of the cosmic expansion history would be invaluable , and can provide additional cross check with the results obtained from the existing methods . combining the results obtained by different means may further help to constrain robustly the dynamical nature of the universe .",
    "@xcite proposed a novel approach to explore the expansion history of the universe , which is based on the age ",
    "redshift relation of passively evolving massive galaxies .",
    "assuming that the passively evolving galaxies at different redshifts were born approximately at the same time , the age of these galaxies can then be taken as a cosmic chronometer .",
    "if the ages of such galaxies can be accurately estimated , then this age ",
    "redshift relation may be used to determine the cosmic expansion history .",
    "even if there is some systematic errors in the absolute age measurements , it is argued that such errors could be canceled in the relative age of these galaxies at different redshifts , thus providing a good measurement of @xmath8 : @xmath9 indeed , observations show that the most massive galaxies are mainly composed of old stellar populations formed at redshifts @xmath10 , less than @xmath11 of their present stellar mass is formed at @xmath12 @xcite , hence these galaxies are suitable for this application .",
    "@xcite applied this method to a sample of massive galaxies at low redshift by fitting their spectra with the single stellar population ( ssp ) spectra based on the speed model @xcite , and obtained @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite assembled a high redshift data set obtained from the gemini deep survey ( gdds ) and some other archival data , and applied the same method to estimate @xmath8 for a large redshift range ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "these earlier works on the age ",
    "redshift relation adopted the ssp to fit each galaxy spectrum in the sample , and selected the age of the oldest one in each redshift bin as the envelop of the age .",
    "however , the poor signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath1 ) spectra of individual galaxies and the contamination from the telluric emission and absorption may lead to uncertainties in the age estimates , and the method of the oldest galaxy envelop draw results from a small number of galaxies at the extremes of the distribution , which may also undermine the validity of the result , and makes the method hard to use .    to overcome this problem",
    ", @xcite obtained the combined spectra for those luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) with similar physical properties in each redshift bin by co - adding their spectra , of which the @xmath1 is much higher than individual galaxies .",
    "they then estimated the age of the combined spectra by using the standard lick absorption line indices , which may be regarded as the mean age of a large sample of galaxies .",
    "they obtained the age  redshift relation , but they did not use this relation to further constrain the hubble parameter .    in this paper , we first select a lrg sample from the sdss data release 7 ( dr7 ) . in order to improve the @xmath1 and remove the contamination , we also use the combined spectrum rather than the single spectrum of each galaxy .",
    "however , we adopt the full spectrum fitting method , different from the standard lick absorption line indices adopted by @xcite , to estimate the mean age of the combined spectrum , and then obtain the age  redshift relation .",
    "furthermore , we also use the age - redshift relation obtained from the combined spectra to constrain the hubble parameter at the present time @xmath2 and analyze the possible systematic bias in the estimated @xmath2 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2 ,",
    "we describe the selection criteria of the lrg sample . in section  3 , we provide the details of the fitting method and the age ",
    "redshift relation estimated from the lrg sample . in section  4 , we constrain the hubble parameter by using the obtained age - redshift relation .",
    "discussions on the resulted age  redshift relation and the possible associated systematic bias are given in section  5 .",
    "conclusions are summarized in section  6 .",
    "in order to obtain the age  redshift relation and use it to measure the hubble parameter , it is necessary to first select a large sample of passively evolving galaxies that contains the oldest populations with homogeneous physical properties .",
    "the sdss is currently the largest survey that provides hundreds of millions of detected objects with accurate photometric and astrometric calibrations , and part of the objects have excellent spectra @xcite .",
    "it is generally accepted that the lrgs are passively evolving galaxies and that they host the oldest stellar populations .",
    "therefore , we pick our sample from the lrgs of the sdss dr7 @xcite .    for our purpose , it is necessary to determine the physical properties of the lrgs with relatively high accuracy by using their spectra . considering that some physical parameters such as the velocity dispersions and emission lines are available in the mpa / jhu sample only for cut i lrgs ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we select only from the cut i lrgs . to obtain accurate estimates of the age through the full spectrum fitting method",
    ", the selected galaxies should also have sufficiently high @xmath1 .",
    "our selection criteria for lrgs are similar to that described in @xcite , but with an additional restriction on the @xmath1 as follows :    * selecting galaxies from catalog archive server ( cas ) database using the ` target_galaxy_red ` flag ; * selecting galaxies with @xmath15 per pixel ( in the continuum of the r - band wavelength range ) ; * selecting galaxies which further satisfying the restrictions : ` specclass eq spec_galaxy`,`zstat eq xcorr_hic ` , ` zwarning eq 0 ` , ` eclass < 0 ` , ` z < 0.4 ` and ` fracdev_r > 0.8 ` ( see more details in * ? ? ? * ) .        according to the criteria above ,",
    "71,971 lrgs are selected from the sdss dr7 and their redshift distribution is shown in figure  [ fig : f1 ] ( the dotted histogram ) .",
    "these lrgs are probably contaminated by the bulges of late - type galaxies at low redshift , due to the limited fiber size ( 3 ) of the sdss spectrograph .",
    "such late contaminants would however have new star formations , and it is well known that the [ o ] and @xmath16 lines are indicators of star formation , hence we can remove the spiral bulges from the selected sample and obtain an sample of quiescent lrgs by using the spectral line data . here",
    "we use the mpa / jhu spectral line data , which has been widely used in selecting quiescent galaxies in the literature .",
    "we select those lrgs as quiescent only if their @xmath16 and [ o ] line emission are consistent with zero at @xmath17 level . with this criterion ,",
    "we obtain 27,208 quiescent lrgs .",
    "we note here that using other emission lines to select quiescent galaxies may result in a similar quiescent lrg sample , as @xcite pointed out that all other emission lines ( such as the joint constraint of @xmath18 and [ o ] or n and s ) show similar zero - emission line distributions .    to estimate the hubble expansion rate @xmath8 by using the age - redshift relation , it is important to select samples of galaxies with homogeneous physical properties as demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the quiescent lrgs selected above are divided into four sub - samples according to their velocity dispersions , which are listed in the mpa / jhu galaxy catalog .",
    "the velocity dispersion bins for each sub - sample of the lrgs are @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "we denote these four sub - samples as sub - sample i , sub - sample ii , sub - sample iii , and sub - sample iv , respectively . in each of the velocity dispersion bins ,",
    "the number of galaxies is still sufficiently large for the following co - adding spectra to reach a high @xmath1 ( @xmath23 )",
    ". we do not consider galaxies with velocity dispersions larger than @xmath24 , as the total number of those galaxies at @xmath25 is too small ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "in addition since the total number of galaxies with velocity dispersion less than @xmath27 is 1843 , much smaller than the number of galaxies in all other sub samples , we also exclude these galaxies .",
    "the number of galaxies in each sub - sample is listed in table  [ tab : t1 ] , and after excluding those lrgs with @xmath28 or @xmath29 , the total number of the final sample is 23,883 .",
    "the redshift distribution of these galaxies is shown in figure  [ fig : f1 ] ( the solid histogram ) .",

    "there are three commonly adopted methods for measuring the age and metallicity of a stellar system from its spectrum : ( 1 ) the sed fitting , ( 2 ) the lick indices fitting , and ( 3 ) the full spectrum fitting .",
    "the first method is only sensitive to the general shape of the continuum , the second one focuses on using the strength or equivalent width of lines and specific spectrum features , and the third one accounts all the information of the spectrum , including both the continuum and the lines and specific features .",
    "the full spectrum fitting method has several advantages , such as being insensitive to extinction or flux calibration errors , and it is also not limited by the physical broadening of lines since the internal kinematics is determined simultaneously with the population parameters @xcite , though it is insensitive to the element ratio effects because of yet no available models about these . on the other hand , it is more sensitive to the wavelength range of the spectrum adopted in the fitting and the resolution of the spectrum compared with the fitting with the lick indices .      `",
    "ulyss ` is an open - source software package developed by a group in universit de lyon , which implements the full - spectrum fitting to study physical properties of stellar populations . in ` ulyss ` , an observed spectrum is fitted by a model spectrum , adopting a linear combination of non - linear components , optionally convolved with a line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) and multiplied by a polynomial function .",
    "the multiplicative polynomial is adopted to absorb errors of the flux calibration , galactic extinction and other factors which may affect the shape of the spectrum .",
    "it minimizes @xmath40 value by the mpfit function when matching an observed spectrum with the model ones . the line spread function ( lsf ) , an analogy to the point spread function ( psf ) for images ,",
    "is also introduced in ` ulyss ` in order to effectively match the resolution of the model spectrum to the observations . for details about ` ulyss ` , the readers are referred to @xcite . since the full spectrum fitting method may be sensitive to the wavelength range of the spectrum adopted in the fitting , we adopt the galexev / stelib model , a popular single stellar populations ( ssps ) synthesis model which covers the largest wavelength range , i.e. @xmath41@xmath42 .",
    "this wavelength range includes the ca triplet ( @xmath43 ) , which is a prominent feature produced primarily by an old population of red - giants and thus important for determining the age of the quiescent lrgs @xcite .",
    "the galexev / stelib(gs ) population model is produced by the isochrone synthesis code of bc03 @xcite , which is widely used in sdss data analysis .",
    "it use the stelib library which contains 249 spectra , but only 187 stars have measured metallicity and can be used to compute the predicted spectra with a 3 spectral resolution . the gs model adopts the padova  94 isochrones @xcite and the chabrier imf @xcite . totally",
    "696 ssps , covering the age of @xmath44  gyr and the [ fe / h ] of @xmath45  dex , are included in the gs model .",

    "it is necessary to transform either the model spectrum or the observed spectrum to match the resolution of the other one .",
    "the spectral resolution is characterized by the instrumental broadening or the lsf . in practice , the lsf is not necessarily a gaussian and may vary with wavelength ( see more details on the lsf in @xcite ) . in",
    "` ulyss ` , three types of calibrations ( arc lamp , standard star , twilight spectrum ) can be used to determine the relative lsf between the model and the observation . in this paper",
    ", we use the standard star to do the calibrations . `",
    "ulyss ` adopts a convolution of the model with a series of lsfs , which are determined at some wavelengths , and then interpolates linearly in the wavelength range between two convolved models .",
    "we follow the steps described in @xcite and @xcite to match the resolution of the spectra for galaxies in our sample with that from the gs model .",
    "we use the spectrum of sdss standard star , which is already contained in the ` ulyss ` package , as a representative of the sdss observations . for the gs model spectrum ,",
    "the relative lsf is obtained in ` ulyss ` by comparing the spectrum of the observed spectrum of the sdss standard stars with the gs model spectrum of the stars with the same physical properties .",
    "we then adopt this relative lsf to generate the resolution - matched gs model spectrum by the lsf convolution function in the ` ulyss ` package .",
    "below when we mention the gs model spectrum we are actually referring to such resolution - matched ones .",
    "we adopt the ssps given by ` ulyss ` to fit the combined spectrum or the spectrum of each galaxy in our sample but do not consider the detailed star formation history ( sfh ) of each galaxy , as the sample is almost homogeneous and the galaxies in it are passively evolving .",
    "we defer the discussion of the effect due to the difference in the sfh of each galaxy to section  [ sect : discussion ] .",
    "high @xmath1 spectra are essential to obtain accurate estimates of the age of galaxies .",

    "redshift relation effectively , the uncertainties in age estimates need to be smaller than @xmath48 . for the majority of galaxies in our sample ,",
    "however , their sdss spectra have @xmath51 , which leads to @xmath52 uncertainties in age estimates . to overcome this problem",
    ", we choose to co - add the spectra of galaxies in each sub - sample ( and each red - shift bin ) to obtain a combined spectrum with significantly higher @xmath1 ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "to do this , we first correct the foreground galactic extinction by using the reddening maps of @xcite for each galaxy .",
    "as the number of galaxies at @xmath54 is too small in all of the sub - samples , these galaxies are neglected in the following analysis .",
    "the galaxies in each sub - sample are then divided into @xmath55 redshift bins from @xmath56 to @xmath57 with a redshift step of @xmath58 . a combined spectrum",
    "is then obtained for each redshift and velocity dispersion bin by co - adding the rest frame spectra of all the galaxies in that bin through the ` iraf ` task ` scombine ` .",
    "we thus obtained 12 combined spectra over redshift bins from @xmath59 to @xmath60 for each sub - sample .",
    "the combined spectra are then fitted by ` ulyss ` . `",
    "ulyss ` use levenberg - marquardt routine to search the parameter space to get the minimization of @xmath40 .",
    "so it needs some initial guess value to begin searching the parameter space . in this paper",
    ", we set the initial guess for the age to 8 gyr and for metallicity to solar metallicity since the lrgs are expected to be old and metal rich .",

    "@xcite studied the spectra of 124 early - type galaxies in both high and low density environments by using the absorption line indices , and they also found that @xmath79 correlates with @xmath82 . adopting the data in @xcite , the slope of the @xmath84 relation",

    "we perform monte - carlo simulations to visualize the degeneracies and validate the errors by simulating the effect of the noise . for each combined spectrum , we perform 1000 simulations . in each of the simulations a random gaussian noise is added to the combined spectrum and the amplitude of the added noise is set to the estimated noise associated to the combined spectrum .",

    "note also there is strong degeneracy between @xmath90 and ( @xmath2,@xmath94 ) obtained from the fitting , which introduces a large uncertainty in the estimation of @xmath90 .    according to the above fittings , obviously a strong constraint on @xmath2 can still be obtained by either assuming a simple model independent form of the evolution of @xmath8 or a flat universe , i.e. , @xmath148 , although the age  redshift relations are obtained in a limited redshift range and the uncertainties in the age estimates may be substantial .",
    "the @xmath2 estimated from the sub - sample with lower velocity dispersion tends to be higher than that from the sub - sample with higher velocity dispersion ( more massive and luminous lrgs ) , which may be due to some bias introduced by the systematical difference in the assembly history of less massive galaxies and massive galaxies .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the evolution of galaxies in the red sequence is heavily dependent on luminosity , i.e. , the lower the luminosity of the galaxies , the more significant the population of new stars formed since @xmath149 .",

    "considerable progress has been made in determining the hubble parameter over the past two decades by using many different techniques ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "for example , the hubble parameter is estimated to be @xmath154 by using the tip of the red giant branch as an alternate calibration to the cepheid distance scale @xcite ; @xmath155 by using the surface brightness fluctuation to determine cosmic distances @xcite ; @xmath156 by using type ia supernovae @xcite ; @xmath157 by using the sunyaev - zeldovich effect @xcite ; and @xmath158 by using the bao signature in the matter power spectrum @xcite .",
    "the hubble space telescope key project yielded a consistent value of @xmath159 by combining the data obtained from different techniques @xcite .",
    "@xcite also obtained a value of @xmath160 by combining the wmap-5 data with the sne ia and bao data , while @xcite found consistently low values of @xmath2 , from several different tracers they obtain a mean value of @xmath161 .",
    "considering of the possible systematic error in the @xmath2 estimation by using the age ",
    "redshift relation , our estimates of @xmath2 are fully consistent with those listed above .",
    "in this paper , we have obtained the mean age , metallicity and velocity dispersion for a sample of quiescent galaxies selected from the sdss dr7 in different redshift bins .",
    "the age - redshift relation derived from those quiescent galaxies is consistent with the expectation from the @xmath7cdm cosmology and may provide a good estimate of the hubble parameter ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "however , the estimate of @xmath2 is valid only if those quiescent galaxies are passively evolving and the galaxies in different redshift bins represent the same population formed more or less at the same time . in order to check whether these requirements are satisfied for the quiescent galaxy sample selected in this paper , we perform some tests below to investigate the evolution effects due to different star formation history or galaxy mergers , and illustrate that those quiescent galaxies are indeed more or less formed at the same epoch using the evolution of their average colors .      according to the selection criteria , most galaxies in our sample should be quiescent galaxies and supposed to be passively evolving .",
    "however , the star formation history of those galaxies may not be a single burst . to test whether there are significant younger stellar populations in the galaxies",
    ", we re - do the full spectrum fitting for each combined spectrum by adopting two stellar components , one young stellar population ( ysp ) and one old stellar population ( osp ) .",
    "the age of the young stellar population is assumed to be in the range from @xmath162  gyr to @xmath163  gyr , while for the old population it is assumed to be in the range from @xmath163  gyr to @xmath164  gyr .",
    "for both populations , the metallicity is a free parameter without restrictions . according to the fitting results , we note here that the fitting age of the ysp always reaches the edge of its limits ( the age of ysp is always either @xmath162  gyr or @xmath163  gyr ) , which means that a ysp with an age in the given range can not be found .",
    "furthermore , even if there exist a ysp , the light fraction ( lf ) is very small ( @xmath165 on average ) so that it can be neglected .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the ysp ( the age of which @xmath166  gyr ) is negligible and not required in the fitting .",
    "we also test the cases by setting a larger upper limit on the age of the ysp , e.g. , @xmath167  gyr , @xmath168  gyr or even @xmath169  gyr ( or alternatively a lower limit on the age of the old stellar population , i.e. , @xmath169  gyr to @xmath170  gyr ) , and also find that no significant ysp is required by the fitting .",
    "all these tests suggest that most of the quiescent lrgs may be passively evolving and not experience significant recent ( @xmath171  gyr ) star formation . for those galaxies at low redshift bins , however , we find there may exist ysp s with age @xmath172  gyr , possibly due to the later major mergers ( see discussions in section  [ sect : discussion2 ] ) .",
    "to close this sub - section , we note here that @xcite find bright lrgs being consistent with pure passive evolution while faint lrgs slightly deviating from pure passive evolution as revealed by the evolution of the number and luminosity density of lrgs as well as that of their clustering .",
    "the lesser passiveness of lrgs with smaller velocity dispersion seems not to be able to be directly revealed by the combined spectra of lrgs studied in this paper , which might be due to that the signature of ysps ( probably with quite different ages ) in ( some of ) the lrgs may be diluted or smoothed due to the co - adding of a large number of lrg spectra in our analysis .",
    "high s / n spectra of individual lrgs may be helpful to clarify the less passiveness of small lrgs , however , the s / n of most lrgs in our sample are only slightly larger than 10 and not sufficiently high for clarifying this problem .",
    "the combined spectrum in each redshift and velocity bin may only represent the mean spectrum of galaxies in that bin .",
    "does the physical properties derived from the model fitting of this combined spectrum represent the mean properties of all galaxies in that bin ? in order to test this , we fit each single spectrum for all the galaxies in each velocity dispersion bin and redshift bin with ` ulyss ` .",

    "we have combined the spectra of galaxies in each redshift and velocity dispersion bin together to improve the @xmath1 . however , the age difference obtained by modeling the combined spectra can represent the age difference of the universe only if those galaxies at different redshifts are the same population and were formed more or less in the same epoch .",
    "there is a potential caveat to this approach , i.e. , if a significant fraction of quiescent galaxies experience major mergers and thus some star formation at low redshift @xmath4 , then some quiescent galaxies in the redshift bin @xmath175 were formed at @xmath176 and they were not represented by those galaxies in the redshift bin @xmath177 .",
    "it is important to check the effect of the major merger of galaxies on the age - redshift relation .",
    "the major merger rate of galaxies is defined as the number of mergers per galaxy with mass larger than a threshold ( @xmath178 ) per unit time and denoted as @xmath179 , and it can be roughly estimated by the fitting formula given by @xcite , i.e. , @xmath180,\\ ] ] where the normalization is @xmath181 { \\rm gyr^{-1}},\\ ] ] and the redshift evolution is @xmath182 and @xmath183 . for the galaxies in our sample , they are generally brighter than @xmath184 @xcite and have stellar masses in the range from @xmath185 to a few times @xmath186 according to @xcite . assuming that the minimum mass of those galaxies is @xmath187 , the average number of major mergers experienced by a galaxy at redshift @xmath92 since @xmath188 is @xmath189 where @xmath190 is given by eq .",

    "note that almost all the major mergers are dry mergers for massive galaxies with mass @xmath198 similar to that in our sample @xcite .",
    "these dry mergers may also lead to new star formation or star burst in the galactic centers , and thus introduce a systematic bias to the age  redshift relation , because the mean age obtained from the combined spectra by the gs model at low redshift bins may be systematically underestimated due to the additional population of stars formed later .",
    "we check the effect of these major mergers on the age ",
    "redshift relation as following .",
    "first , we assume an underlying age - redshift relation according to the @xmath7cdm , i.e. , the age of the galaxy at redshift @xmath92 is @xmath199 , and @xmath200 , @xmath201 , @xmath202 are assumed . here",
    "@xmath202 is adopted according to the average formation time obtained by fitting the age - redshift relation for four velocity dispersion bins ( see section  [ sect : hubble_parameter ] for details ) .",

    "redshift relations for the quiescent lrgs in this paper is larger than that obtained by thomas et al .",

    "note that this fraction may be an upper limit as the lrgs studied here are quiescent ones , in which the star formation generated by major mergers might be even less .",
    "therefore , the fraction of the young population contributing to the combined spectrum is @xmath213 , and the fraction of the old population is @xmath214 .",
    "we fit these spectra obtained for each redshift by the same method as that in section  [ sect : combined spectrum ] and obtain the age for these combined spectra . similar to that in section  [ sect : hubble_parameter ] , we obtain the best fit of @xmath215 by fixing @xmath201 .    from the above calculation , we conclude that @xmath2 may be systematically overestimated by up to @xmath3 if using the age - redshift relation obtained from the combined spectra . considering this systematic bias , @xmath2 estimated from the age  redshift relation in this paper is consistent with those estimated by other techniques .",
    "note also that the systematic bias introduced to the @xmath2 estimate appears not significant for the two sub - samples with the highest velocity dispersions , which might mean that those very massive lrgs are really quiescent and have approximately zero star formation at redshift @xmath216 .",
    "@xcite have pointed out that the brightest galaxies show the smallest departure from pure passive evolution .",
    "therefore , the most massive lrgs with velocity dispersion @xmath217 may be efficient tools to constrain the cosmological parameters , such as @xmath2 , through the age ",
    "redshift relations extracted from their spectra .",
    "we also check whether the g - r color of the galaxies having the combined spectra in each redshift bin is consistent with that of the model galaxies that have the same spectrum as the combined spectrum in the highest redshift bin . to do this ,",
    "we extract a model spectrum from the gs model grid , whose age and metallicity are the best fitting results with ` ulyss ` for redshift bin 0.36 - 0.39 , then we let this spectrum evolve toward the low redshift .",

    "we fit these galaxies with ssps .",
    "the initial settings are the same as that in section  [ sect : combined spectrum ] .",
    "similarly , we extract the corresponding spectrum from the gs model according to the best fit .",
    "then we calculate the g - r color and find that dispersion of the g - r color is very small compared with that of the combined spectrum , which means the results of the single spectrum are consistent with that of the combined spectrum .      in this paper",
    ", we use the galexev / stelib model to fit the combined spectra , as its wavelength coverage is wider compared with the other models provided by the ` ulyss ` package . for completeness",
    ", we also test the pegase - hr / elodie3.1 model and the vazdekis / miles model , and find there is some model dependence .",
    "the model dependence may be caused by the limitation of wavelength coverage as the pegase - hr / elodie3.1 model covers the wavelength from @xmath222@xmath223 , and for the vazdekis / miles model it is @xmath224@xmath225 .",
    "this result is consistent with that of @xcite , in which they analyzed the photometric data of a large sample of elliptical galaxies and found that @xmath226 and @xmath227 for two different stellar population synthesis models , i.e. , pegase and gissel , respectively .",
    "the main ingredients of those models are the stellar evolution tracks , the stellar library , the imf , the grids of ages and metallicities , and the sfhs , etc .",
    "each model may have different settings in one or more of those ingredients .",
    "as demonstrated by @xcite , at present there are still some differences in the output between these different models",

    "we note here that is also interesting to test the model given by @xcite , which is based on the fuel consumption theorem and quite different from the other models .",
    "however , it is not easy to test this model because it is not yet included in the ` ulyss ` code .    from the above tests , we conclude that the age  redshift relation obtained from the combined spectra of a large sample of quiescent lrgs can be used to constrain the hubble parameter @xmath2 ( and possibly other cosmological parameters if combining with other data sets ) .",
