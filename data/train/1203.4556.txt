    "they concluded that many exact solutions presented in literature are wrong , except the one with the delta function potential .",
    "this not only casts doubt on the existing solutions in literature , but also makes it very difficult to find a meaningful solution . in this manuscript",

    "the fastest way to introduce memory effects into an existing equation is to replace a time derivative with its fractional counterpart . in this regard , recently we have reconsidered the time fractional schrdinger equation and its separable solutions [ 2 ] .",
    "the space fractional schrdinger equation naturally incorporates non local effects and was first introduced by laskin [ 3 - 7 ] .",
    "it is intriguing that the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics over lvy paths , which has many interesting examples in nature , leads naturally to the space fractional schrdinger equation where the space derivative is replaced by the fractional riesz derivative [ 2,7 ] . in this",
    "regard , riesz derivative plays a central role in the fractional generalization of the schrdinger equation , where solutions for various potentials are available [ 3 - 9 ] .",
    "it should be emphasized that even thought memory and/or non local effects can be studied via the fractional generalizations of certain derivatives in physical equations , there could also be  interesting cases where fractional derivatives alone are not sufficient [ 10,11 ] .",
    "for example , path integral formulations of quantum mechanics over distributions other than the lvy distribution , would not necessarily lead to a fractional schrdinger equation .",
    "fractional extension of quantum mechanics that treats coordinates and conjugated momentum equivalently have also been considered in literature [ 12 ] .",
    "to understand the effects of fractional derivatives in schrdinger equation , one could try effective potentials within the framework of quantum mechanics . in this regard ,",
    "we have introduced the effective potential approach for the time fractional schrdinger equation [ 2 ] , which allowed us to write the time dependence of the separable solutions , which is a mittag - leffler function with an imaginary argument , as the product of its purely oscillating and purely decaying parts . in this manuscript , we also write the effective potential for the space fractional schrdinger equation and apply it to the infinite well problem .",

    "note that the integral @xmath23 is a singular integral with poles on the real axis at @xmath24 which could be evaluated via analytic continuation as a cauchy principal value integral [ 13 ] .    substituting @xmath25 we first write @xmath26 as two integrals:@xmath27 for the first integral , @xmath28 we close the contour in the upper half @xmath29plane with a semicircular path of radius @xmath30 and",

    "the proof for the even values of @xmath41 is similar .",
    "for the separable solutions of the free space fractional schrdinger equation we use laskin s notation : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the riesz derivative and @xmath49 for a separable solution , @xmath50 found by solving the free space fractional schrdinger equation we can define an effective potential in terms of the schrdinger equation as @xmath51 @xmath52 for separable solutions , the free space fractional schrdinger equation reduces to @xmath53 where the energy eigenvalues , @xmath54 come from the solution of equation ( 33 ) with the appropriate boundary conditions and , the time dependence is given as @xmath55 since in the presence of a potential , @xmath56 the corresponding fractional hamiltonian : @xmath57 is hermitian , the energy eigenvalues are real [ 7 ] .",
