    "superstring theory has emerged as the most promising candidate for a quantum theory of all known interactions .",
    "the phenomenology of @xmath5 heterotic string theory  @xcite exhibits many of the attractive features of the low - energy physics that we see today .",
    "in particular , the four - dimensional standard model ( sm ) gauge group @xmath6 and its generations can be easily incorporated .",
    "string theory also offers an elegant explanation for the doublet - triplet splitting problem  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the unification of gauge couplings and gravity is an intrinsic property of heterotic string theory .",
    "remarkably , unification of couplings is a prediction of string theories even without any grand unified theory ( gut ) below the planck scale .",
    "indeed , gauge and gravitational couplings unify at tree level as  @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the string - scale unification coupling constant , @xmath9 is the newton constant , @xmath10 is the regge slope , @xmath11 are the gauge couplings and @xmath12 are the so - called affine or ka - moody levels at which the group factors @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are realized in the four - dimensional string .",
    "the appearance of non - standard affine levels @xmath12 plays an important role in string theories . while the non - abelian factors @xmath16 and @xmath17 should be positive integers , the abelian factor @xmath18 can take a priori any arbitrary value , only constrained to be @xmath19 for the right - handed electron to have a consistent hypercharge assignment .",
    "furthermore , these factors determine the value of the mixing angle @xmath20 at the string scale .    since string theory relates a dimensionless gauge coupling to a dimensionful gravitational coupling , eq .",
    "( [ unif_rel ] ) itself predicts the unification scale @xmath21 , where @xmath22  gev is the planck mass .",
    "this scale is lowered by the inclusion of one - loop string effects and in the weak coupling limit one finds  @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 @xmath26 is the euler constant .",
    "it has also been noted  @xcite that the unification scale in the strong coupling limit can be much lower than the perturbative result given by eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) .",
    "yet , it is not clear whether unification is a robust prediction in this case .",
    "gauge coupling unification is one of the few solid pieces of evidence in favor of supersymmetry .",
    "it is well known that the extrapolation of low - energy data within the framework of the mssm yields an almost perfect unification of gauge couplings at the scale @xmath27  gev , which is about a factor of 25 lower than the string scale of eq .",
    "( [ lambda_s ] ) .",
    "the resolution of this discrepancy has been the subject of many studies and several paths to unification have been proposed  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it is remarkable that , in the non - supersymmetric sm , the one - loop @xmath28 and @xmath29 gauge couplings already unify at a scale @xmath30  gev , which is close to the unification scale predicted by the string theory . in this case",
    ", gauge coupling unification could be achieved for a hypercharge normalization @xmath31  @xcite . however , if two - loop effects are taken into account , the above scale should be at most @xmath32  gev  @xcite , which is one order of magnitude smaller than the expected string scale . for high - scale supersymmetry breaking",
    ", it has been recently shown that gauge coupling unification can be achieved at about @xmath33  gev in axion models with sm vector - like fermions  @xcite , or at @xmath34  gev in the sm with suitable normalizations of the @xmath13 , which can be realized in specific orbifold guts  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the unification scale in all of these cases is somehow below the expected string scale .    in view of the above considerations and in the light of the current precision electroweak data , in this letter we study the problem of gauge coupling unification within string theory , with the aim to look for the minimal particle content which is necessary to add to the sm in order to achieve unification at the weakly coupled heterotic string scale .",
    "we show that the addition of vector - like fermions with an intermediate mass scale leads to such a unification , provided that the hypercharge affine level is non - canonical , i.e. @xmath35 . the existence of such matter states is in general expected in realistic string theories .",
    "we also study the possibility that the extra matter content , which leads to unification , has a mass scale below the tev scale . among the possible minimal solutions",
    ", we find that unification can be achieved with the introduction of three vector - like fermion doublets with a mass around 700  gev , if the affine levels are @xmath36 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this normalization is consistent with an @xmath3 or @xmath37 string - gut compactification  @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the gauge coupling constants at one loop is governed by the renormalization group equations ( rge ) @xmath38 where @xmath39 and the @xmath40-function coefficients @xmath41 are given by @xmath42-\\frac{11}3\\,c_2(g_i)\\ , \\ ] ] for non - supersymmetric theories .",
    "the function @xmath43 is 1 for complex scalars , 2 for chiral fermions and 4 for vector - like fermions .",
    "the casimir group invariant for the adjoint representation , @xmath44 , is @xmath45 for @xmath46 groups and null for a @xmath47 group .",
    "the functions @xmath48 encode the group structure contributions as follows @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the dimension of the representation concerning the invariant subgroup @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the dynkin index which , in our convention , is @xmath53 for the fundamental representations of @xmath46 groups and @xmath54 for the @xmath55 group .",
    "we use the convention that the hypercharge @xmath56 .",
    "in particular , for the sm with @xmath57 generations and @xmath58 complex higgs doublets one finds @xmath59    let us now examine the one - loop running of the gauge couplings . the unified coupling constant @xmath60 at the scale @xmath61 is expressed in terms of the @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath55 gauge couplings and the corresponding affine levels @xmath12 through eqs .",

    "( [ eq : sol1 ] ) we find @xmath82 , a value which is clearly outside the experimental range given in eq .",
    "( [ n : mz ] ) .",
    "the above result already indicates that the string - scale unification of gauge couplings requires either non - perturbative ( or higher - order perturbative ) string effects to lower the unification scale or extra matter particles to modify the rge evolution of the gauge couplings .",
    "it is precisely the second possibility that we consider in this work .    anticipating a possible string - gut compactification scenario",
    ", we shall restrict our analysis to the inclusion of fermions in real irreducible representations .",
    "the addition of chiral fermions leads in general to anomalies and their masses are associated to the electroweak symmetry breaking , which imposes further constraints .",

    "to perform a more precise analysis of string unification , a two - loop rge study becomes necessary . we make use of the two - loop rges of gauge couplings  @xcite , which include the one - loop yukawa coupling running and take properly into account the new physics contributions and threshold . in table",

    "one may ask whether such an intermediate mass scale could be naturally generated . in principle , it might be due to the possible presence of nonrenormalizable higher - order operators or could be associated with an approximate global symmetry , such as a chiral symmetry of peccei - quinn type .    we have also searched for minimal solutions where the new matter states have a mass scale below the tev scale .",
