    "so far we have only considered the scattering relations between the optical in- and out - fields , which due to the linearity of the equations of motion are the same for large classical fields as well as single photons . in practice",
    "additional noise sources will limit the operation of the device to a minimal power level , or equivalently to a minimal number of photons in the probe beams .",

    "( [ eq : pnoise ] ) also shows that the thermal noise level can be further reduced in the strong coupling regime . in this case",
    "the maximal operation bandwidth is @xmath173 and the noise power is suppressed by an additional factor @xmath174 .",
    "this is due to the fact that thermal noise is mainly produced at the two split mode frequencies @xmath175 , while the non - reciprocal effects rely on the transparency window between those modes .",
    "note that while om cooling saturates at @xmath176 , the noise suppression in our device can always be improved with increasing ratio @xmath177 , eventually limited by the onset of the om instability at @xmath178 .",
    "in summary , we have shown that optomechanics can induce non - reciprocity in the optical domain .",
    "in particular , an optomechanical ring resonator coupled to a waveguide induces a non - reciprocal phase in the under - coupled regime ( @xmath43 ) and forms an optical isolator in the critically coupled regime ( @xmath179 ) .    from an application perspective",
    ", this system provides an optical isolator that can be integrated on - chip .",
    "the bandwidth of such a device will be limited by the amount of pump power that the system can tolerate , before nonlinear effects become significant . in current experimental settings",
    "this amounts to bandwidths in the few mhz regime , which however could be further improved in optimized designs .    from a fundamental point of view",

    ", the implementation of magnetic hamiltonians using micron - sized om elements could pave the way for the exploration of fractional quantum hall physics @xcite and various other exotic states of light .",
    "we study the effect of off - resonant om interactions @xmath107 , which lead to a phase sensitive transmission or equivalently , a partial squeezing of light in the output field . for simplicity",
    ", we consider without mode coupling ( @xmath82 ) , assume @xmath180 and @xmath154 , and set the pump field to the red sideband @xmath92 .",
