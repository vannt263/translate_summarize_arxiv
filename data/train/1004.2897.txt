    "additionally , frenkel and coworkers explored the formation of smectic lcs of perfectly aligned @xcite and freely rotating @xcite hard rods , and found a thermodynamically stable smectic phase of hard rods as a result of entropic effects .",
    "the equilibrium properties of smectic lcs are well - studied and are well - understood by now @xcite .",

    "by contrast , the dynamics on a single - particle level in smectic lcs have only recently received attention , although an early study on the diffusion ( or `` permeation '' ) of anisotropic particles had already been reported more than forty years ago by helfrich in order to explain the capillary flow in cholesteric and smectic lcs @xcite .",
    "substantial advances in new experimental techniques ( e.g. nmr coupled to strong magnetic field gradients @xcite or fluorescent labeling @xcite ) disclosed the non - gaussian nature and quasi - quantized behavior of the layer - to - layer diffusion .",
    "these achievements sparked off new theoretical work , based on dynamic density functional theory , which not only confirmed the non - gaussian layer - to - layer hopping - type diffusion and the presence of permanent barriers due to the static smectic background , but also showed the relevance of temporary cages due to the mutual trapping of neighboring particles @xcite .",
    "we note that non - gaussian dynamics due to a rattling - and - jumping diffusive behavior is common in two - dimensional liquids @xcite , cluster crystals @xcite , and glasses @xcite , and has also been observed for the diffusion of a single particle in a periodic external potential @xcite .",

    "the denser state is characterized by a much stronger confinement of the particles to the middle of the smectic layers .",
    "this is especially evident at @xmath50 as the height of the barrier increases from @xmath99 to @xmath100 from @xmath101 to 0.557 .",
    "a similar behavior was detected in experiments on smectic lcs of _ fd _ viruses , where the height of the energy barriers was found to increase from @xmath102 to @xmath103 by decreasing the ionic strength @xcite . according to the authors , a low ionic strength gives rise to stronger correlations due to more pronounced electrostatic interactions between the virus particles , resulting in higher energy barriers .",
    "older experiments on thermotropic liquid crystals estimated energy barriers of @xmath1041 - 4@xmath105 @xcite .",
    "our results are in good quantitative agreement with those obtained by computer simulations in ref .",
    "@xcite , where rods with @xmath9 and 5.0 were studied . additionally , these authors found that the energy barrier for a rod to achieve a transverse inter - layer position was several @xmath105 higher than that to diffuse from layer to layer , confirming the difficulty to detect transverse particles in between smectic layers @xcite .",
    "we further observe that the packing fraction is not the only parameter affecting the effective potentials @xmath56 as displayed in fig .",
    "it is interesting to note that the two systems @xmath35 and @xmath40 , with @xmath106 and @xmath107 as denoted by the open triangles ( @xmath89 ) and with @xmath108 and @xmath109 as shown by the solid circles ( ) , corresponding to very similar packing fractions @xmath110 and 0.557 , respectively , exhibit barrier heights that differ by approximately @xmath111 .",
    "the barrier height at fixed @xmath23 thus increases with the particle anisotropy .",
    "the effect of the particle anisotropy on the effective potential can also be illustrated by comparing the barriers for the systems @xmath36 and @xmath40 with @xmath18 and @xmath112 ( @xmath94 ) and @xmath50 and @xmath109 ( ) , respectively . in this case , although the packing fractions are significantly different ( @xmath23 = 0.568 and 0.557 ) , both barrier heights are @xmath100 .",
    "this result shows that a more pronounced particle anisotropy yields significantly higher energy barriers . in conclusion ,",
    "the barrier height increases with increasing packing fraction and particle anisotropy .",
    "moreover , in our recent work on perfectly aligned hard rods , we noticed that the freezing out of the rotational degrees of freedom has also a quite tangible impact on the height of the barriers , which were found to be higher than those observed in systems of freely rotating rods , especially at low packing fractions @xcite .",
    "such barriers fade out gradually by approaching the continuous n - sm transition , while they remain finite in the case of the first order n - sm transition of freely rotating hard rods .",
    "one might expect that structural defects , such as screw dislocations and stacking faults , could facilitate the layer - to - layer diffusion by creating barrier - free nematic - like pathways through the layers @xcite .",
    "the small size of our system and the periodic boundary conditions preclude the development of such defects .",
    "the periodic shape of the effective potential determines a hopping - type diffusion along the direction parallel to the nematic director @xmath54 , with the particles rattling around in their original layer until they find the appropriate conditions to overcome the barrier and jump to a neighboring smectic layer .",
    "an efficacious way to quantify the diffusion of rattling and jumping rods along @xmath54 is provided by the computation of the self part of the vhfs defined in eq .",
    "( 2 ) . in fig .",
    "3 , we show the self vhfs for the six systems of interest as a function of _ z _ at several equidistant times _ t_. we detect the appearance of peaks at well - defined locations corresponding to the center - of - mass of the smectic layers along @xmath54 , in agreement with previous experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite results . for each aspect ratio",
    ", we note that the height of the peaks is larger and the number of peaks is generally higher at the lowest packing fraction .",
    "this indicates that decreasing the pressure leads to a higher number of jumping particles which are able to diffuse longer distances .",
    "these _ fast _ particles determine the heterogeneous dynamics of the system and affect its structural relaxation .     for smectic lcs of hard spherocylinders with varying length - to - diameter ratios @xmath113 and reduced pressures @xmath17 .",
    "length - to - diameter ratio , pressure , and packing fraction are given in each frame as ( @xmath7 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) .",

    "the ngps as measured in our six systems are shown in fig .",
    "4 . the in - layer ngps , @xmath117 , are essentially negligible for the whole time range , implying a gaussian in - layer dynamics which is typical of a liquid - like system . the layer - to - layer ngps exhibit a time - dependent behavior , which is strictly linked to the caging effect exerted on the rods by their nearest neighbors .",
    "more specifically , @xmath118 is basically zero at short times when the rods are rattling around their original location and do not perceive the presence of the surrounding cage . between @xmath119 and 1.0 , @xmath118 starts to increase , indicating the development of dynamical heterogeneities . during this time interval ,",
    "the motion of the rods is hampered by the trapping cages and becomes subdiffusive .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the average life - time of the cages corresponds to the time between @xmath120 and @xmath121 , the maximum value of the ngp , which occurs at time @xmath122 with @xmath123 , depending on the system .",
    "this peak increases with packing fraction and its location determines the beginning of the long - time diffusive regime , where the deviations from gaussian behavior start to decrease .",
    "increasing the pressure affects the _ z_-diffusion in a twofold manner : ( _ i _ ) it increases its heterogeneous behavior , and ( _ ii _ ) it delays the onset of the long - time diffusive behavior .",
    "comparison of the two systems @xmath35 and @xmath40 , corresponding to very similar packing fractions , shows that the dynamics becomes more non - gaussian for system @xmath40 consisting of longer rods and higher energy barriers . on the other hand , for systems @xmath36 and @xmath40 , displaying similar barrier heights , the non - gaussian dynamics is again more pronounced for system @xmath40 with longer particles .",

    "interestingly , we observed that some rods diffuse very fast , others move to the inter - layer spacing , where they might reside for a long time , and then return to their original layer , and others move from one layer to another several times or perform consecutive jumps as shown in fig .",

    "these transverse inter - layer particles might diffuse either to a new layer or go back to the old one by keeping or changing their original orientation .",

    "single jumps are significantly more frequent than multiple jumps , especially at high densities where the latter are less than 1% of the total number of jumps .",

    ", we introduced a _ dynamic _",
    "cluster criterion .",
    "more specifically , we assume that two jumping rods _",
    "i _ and _ j _ are actually moving cooperatively , if ( 1 ) their arrival times @xmath79 and @xmath80 in their new layers satisfy the condition @xmath176 and ( 2 ) their _ z _ and _ xy _ distances at @xmath79 and @xmath80 are smaller than _ h _ and _ d _ , respectively . to select a consistent value for @xmath84",
    ", we use the distribution of jump times @xmath167 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath84 is the maximal jump time @xmath177 ( i.e. long enough for all jumps to be performed according to @xmath167 ) , we find that for @xmath18 the ratio between the number of collective jumps and the total number of jumps is @xmath178 as given in table i. these jumps involve mainly two or three rods , whereas collective jumps of 4 or more rods are extremely rare .",
    "we further note that the vacated space of a jumping rod can be either occupied by another rod jumping in the same direction or by a rod jumping in the opposite direction , with roughly the same probability .",
    "a less restrictive spatial criterion would not affect significantly these values .",
    "by contrast , the number of collective jumps is rather sensitive to the temporal criterion .",
    "if we reduce @xmath84 to the median jump time @xmath172 , then the fraction of collective jumps , @xmath32 , decreases substantially as shown in table i. regardless the details of the cluster criterion , we thus find a fraction of @xmath179 of the jumps to be collective , the more so for longer rods at lower pressures .",
    "the motion is indeed strongly cooperative at low packing fractions , despite the larger static stringlike clusters detected in the denser systems ( see fig .",
    "this result is most probably due to the permanent smectic barriers which increase upon approaching the smectic - to - solid phase transition and hence hamper the attempted jumps of the rods in the strings .",
    "by contrast , in glass - forming systems , where no permanent barriers are observed , the cluster size increases upon approaching the glass transition @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have studied the diffusion and structural relaxation in _ equilibrium _ smectic lc phases of hard rods with different anisotropies by computer simulations . remarkably , these systems exhibit non - gaussian layer - to - layer diffusion and dynamical heterogeneities which are similar to those observed in _ out - of - equilibrium _ supercooled liquids .",
    "the simultaneous presence of temporary cages due to the trapping action of neighboring rods and the permanent barriers due to the static smectic background , provokes a rattling - and - jumping diffusion which influences the long - time structural relaxation decay . in analogy with glassy systems",
    ", one can clearly distinguish three separate time regimes for _ z_-motion .",
    "the short - time diffusive regime , with the rods rattling around their original location without feeling the surrounding neighbors , is characterized by a gaussian distribution of the _ z_-displacements and an exponential temporal relaxation .",
    "the subdiffusive regime at intermediate times displays a non - gaussianity and a plateau in both mean square displacement and intermediate scattering function . at this stage ,",
    "the interlayer dynamics is heterogeneous with fast - moving particles diffusing individually or cooperatively in a stringlike fashion .",
    "finally , at long times , the systems enter a second diffusive regime with gaussian distributions of the displacements and non - exponential decay of the intermediate scattering function . by contrast , at all time - scales , the in - layer diffusion is typical for two - dimensional fluids with a negligible ngp and a structural relaxation which is at least 4 time decades faster than the inter - layer one .    the analysis of the self - vhfs points out the tendency for the rods to diffuse from layer to layer through quasi - discretized jumps .",
    "this hopping - type motion is significantly hampered in very dense systems , where the barriers for the layer - to - layer diffusion intensify the confinement of the rods to the middle of the smectic layers .",
    "the temporal extension of the jumps is not uniform , but characterized by a rather broad time distribution which covers approximately two time decades .",
    "depending on the dwelling time between two successive jumps of the same particle , single and multiple jumps have been detected , with the former significantly more frequent than the latter , especially at high densities .",
    "although the inter - layer rods are usually oriented along the nematic director , some of them assume a transverse orientation .",
    "the long tails of the vhfs indicate the presence of particles that are able to diffuse much longer distances than the average , especially at low packing fractions .",
    "interestingly , the dynamic behavior of such fast - moving particles supports the intriguing analogy with glassy systems even further .",
    "in particular , fast - moving particles assemble in stringlike clusters whose average length increases upon approaching the smectic - to - crystal phase transition . likewise",
    ", fragile and strong glass - formers show a similar tendency when cooled down towards the glass transition temperature @xcite .",
    "we also gave clear evidence that the strings detected in static configurations can promote collective diffusion of jumping particles .",
    "this is especially tangible at low packing fractions where the hampering action of the permanent energy barriers is less effective .",
    "finally , we also investigated the effect of particle anisotropy on the non - gaussian layer - to - layer diffusion and cooperative motion in smectic lcs .",
    "we find that at fixed packing fraction , the barrier height increases with increasing particle anisotropy , and hence the dynamics is more heterogeneous and non - gaussian for longer rods , yielding a lower diffusion coefficient along the nematic director and smaller clusters of inter - layer particles that move less cooperatively . at fixed barrier height , the dynamics becomes more non - gaussian and heterogeneous for longer rods ; smaller clusters move more collectively , giving rise to a higher diffusion coefficient along the nematic director .",
    "our results , which might be relevant for the study of the dynamics in confined fluids @xcite as well as for the diffusion of lipids and proteins in cellular membranes @xcite , are already stimulating the analysis of dynamical processes in columnar liquid crystals , where the presence of inter - columnar energy barriers provokes a non - gaussian hopping - type motion and a relaxation behavior that is also remarkably similar to that of out - of - equilibrium supercooled liquids @xcite .",
