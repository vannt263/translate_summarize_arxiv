    "in the standard model ( sm ) , flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes are absent at the tree level .",
    "they only appear at the loop level and are further strongly suppressed by small ckm mixing angles .",
    "consequently , fcncs are highly sensitive probes of any new physics ( np ) that is not flavor blind . remarkably , up to now",
    "all experimental results on flavor observables are consistent with sm expectations and lead to strong indirect constraints on np models even at energy scales far beyond the direct reach of colliders .",
    "indeed if new degrees of freedom exist that couple to quarks at tree level with generic flavor and cp violating interactions , flavor constraints , in particular constraints from neutral kaon mixing , require the corresponding np scale to be above @xmath4  tev .",
    "if np does exist at the tev scale , as naturalness arguments indicate , then current flavor constraints already imply that its flavor structure has to be highly non - generic .    in this talk",
    "i describe the impact that the recent experimental progress on @xmath5 and charm physics observables has on models of np . after reviewing the status of the tension between @xmath6 and @xmath7 in sec .",

    "combining babar and belle results of the @xmath6 decay leads to the following average for its branching ratio  @xcite @xmath10 in the sm , the charged current @xmath6 decay proceeds through tree level exchange of a @xmath11 boson and is helicity suppressed by the @xmath12 mass .",
    "the sm prediction of the branching ratio depends sensitively on the value of the ckm element @xmath13 . using an average , obtained from direct measurements in inclusive and exclusive semi - leptonic",
    "b decays , @xmath14  @xcite as well as the precise lattice determination of the b meson decay constant @xmath15  mev  @xcite , one obtains @xmath16 within @xmath17 , this is compatible with the experimental value .",
    "if one instead uses an indirect determination of @xmath13 from the measurements of @xmath7 as well as @xmath18 one finds @xmath19 which is more than a factor of two and almost @xmath20 below the experimental value .",
    "interpreted as a hint for np , this tension between @xmath21 and @xmath7 can be addressed either by a sizable negative np phase in @xmath22 mixing or by o(1 ) np effects in @xmath6 .",
    "a well known example is tree level charged higgs exchange that can lead to large modifications of @xmath6 . while in two higgs doublet models of type ii , the charged higgs contribution necessarily interferes destructively with the sm , the more general framework of two higgs doublet models with minimal flavor violation ( mfv ) allows also for constructive interference and an explanation of the tension  @xcite .",
    "cp violation in @xmath1 mixing is strongly suppressed in the sm and therefore an excellent probe of np .",

    "the small preference for a negative np phase in @xmath22 mixing on the other hand can be addressed for example in two higgs doublet models with mfv through tree level exchange of flavor changing neutral higgs bosons .",
    "if the quartic couplings in the higgs potential are mssm - like , these models predict a much larger np phase in @xmath1 mixing than in @xmath22 mixing  @xcite , which is clearly excluded by the current data . with more general higgs potentials however ,",

    "in the sm , the rare leptonic decays @xmath2 and @xmath42 are strongly helicity suppressed by the muon mass and their branching ratios are tiny  at the level of @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively . due to the remarkably precise determinations of the b meson decay constants on the lattice  @xcite",

    "upper bounds are reported by cdf  @xcite , cms  @xcite and lhcb  @xcite . performing a naive combination of the available results one finds @xmath56 while in @xmath42 there is still room for almost an order of magnitude enhancement , the recent results on @xmath2 only allow for moderate deviations from the sm prediction .",
    "on the one hand this leads to very strong constraints on models with scalar operators , on the other hand , models without scalar operators are starting to be probed by @xmath2 only now .",
    "an important observable in the future will be the ratio of the @xmath1 and @xmath22 branching ratios . in models with minimal flavor violation",
    "there exists a strong correlation @xmath57 given the existing bounds on @xmath52 , an enhancement of @xmath58 by more than a factor of 2 would not only be a clear indication of np , but also of new sources of flavor violation beyond the ckm matrix .",
    "the semileptonic exclusive @xmath59 decay and its conjugated mode @xmath60 are described by 4-fold differential decay distributions @xmath61 and @xmath62 in terms of the dimuon invariant mass @xmath63 , and three angles @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( see _ e.g. _",

    "measurements of angular observables exist from babar  @xcite , belle  @xcite , cdf  @xcite and lhcb  @xcite and all show reasonable agreement with the sm predictions so far .",
    "the various observables each depend in a characteristic way on the wilson coefficients of the dimension six @xmath75 operators contributing to @xmath9 .",

    "the strongest bounds currently come from branching ratios and cp averaged angular coefficients , and therefore the imaginary parts of @xmath85 are much less constrained than the real parts .",
    "future improved measurements of cp asymmetries in @xmath9 that are directly sensitive to new cp violating phases will be essential to probe the imaginary parts of the wilson coefficients .",
    "cp violation in the charm sector is highly cabibbo suppressed in the sm and therefore very sensitive to possible np effects .",
    "current bounds on cp violating parameters in @xmath89 mixing are at the level of @xmath90  @xcite and still far above the naive sm expectation of @xmath91 .",
    "naive sm estimates for direct cp violation in singly cabibbo suppressed @xmath92 decays such as @xmath87 and @xmath88 are even smaller , @xmath93 .",

    "this result has been confirmed by cdf  @xcite and a combination that includes also previous results from babar and belle leads to  @xcite @xmath97 which is approximately @xmath33 away from 0 . to a very good approximation",
    ", @xmath94 corresponds to the difference in the direct cp asymmetries in @xmath87 and @xmath88 and is therefore expected to be at least one order of magnitude smaller in the sm , unless the hadronic matrix elements entering the sm prediction are strongly enhanced with respect to naive estimates  @xcite . while the required strong enhancement is not expected to be natural in the sm  @xcite , it can not be excluded presently  @xcite . nonetheless , the interpretation of the experimental results as a signal of np is interesting and motivated .",
    "possible np explanations typically will predict non - standard signals also in other low energy flavor observables or characteristic signatures at colliders that can be searched for and that can be used to test the np hypothesis .",
    "both model independent analyses  @xcite , and studies of concrete np scenarios ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) show that np explanations of large direct cp violation in singly cabibbo suppressed @xmath98 decays are often highly constrained by other flavor observables , in particular @xmath89 mixing and @xmath99 , _",
    "i.e. _ direct cp violation in neutral kaon decays . among the numerous np possibilities , the one that generically avoids both these constraints are loop induced chromomagnetic dipole operators @xmath100 that can lead to chirally enhanced contributions to the direct cp asymmetries .",
    "studies of cp asymmetries in radiative @xmath101 decays could help to probe the possible dipole origin of @xmath94  @xcite .    among np models",
    "that contribute significantly to @xmath94 through tree - level induced four fermion operators , only few are viable .",
    "known examples include models where the np contribution is mediated by scalars with masses at the electro - weak scale and flavor changing couplings  @xcite .",
    "if these models induce @xmath102 operators , they can be tested using isospin sum rules for cp asymmetries  @xcite .",
    "the necessarily light scalars can be searched for at the lhc .    finally ,",
    "depending on the exact flavor structure of the tree - level models , @xmath94 can originate from either @xmath103 or @xmath104 or from both .",
    "this is in contrast to the dipole operator explanation where one ( naively ) expects @xmath105 .",
    "correspondingly , the separate measurement of the direct cp asymmetries in @xmath106 and @xmath95 would add valuable information to pin down the possible origin of direct cp violation in charm decays .",
    "in absence of any direct evidence for new physics at the lhc , flavor physics continues to stay at the forefront of the search for new phenomena at the tev scale .",
    "while the current experimental results on rare decays like @xmath8 and @xmath3 are in reasonable agreement with sm predictions , they still allow for sizable new physics effects , that can be uncovered with improved precision in the near future .",
    "moreover , anomalies in the current flavor data , like the tension between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the large dimuon charge asymmetry or the recent evidence for direct cp violation in charm decays might already be the first indirect signs of physics beyond the standard model .",
