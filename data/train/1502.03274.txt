    "in nature , complex and chaotic flow universally appears in various systems from small to large scale , for instance , in watercourses , rivers , oceans , and the atmosphere .",
    "such a flow , called turbulence , has attracted considerable attention in various fields because understanding it leads to significant development of fundamental and applied sciences such as mathematics , physics , and technology .",
    "though turbulence has been studied for a long time , however , it is considered to be one of the unresolved problems and becomes an important issue in modern physics .",
    "originally , turbulence has been studied in classical fluids , where it is important to investigate statistical quantities such as the probability density function of the velocity field @xcite .",
    "one of the most significant quantities is the kinetic energy spectrum corresponding to a two - point correlation function of the velocity field , which is known to exhibit the famous kolmogorov @xmath2 power law .",
    "this kolmogorov law appears as a result of the constant - flux energy cascade in wave number space , and the observation of this power law is very important in the study of turbulence .    in quantum fluids , turbulence also appears and has been investigated for many years @xcite .",
    "this turbulence is called quantum turbulence ( qt ) , in contrast to classical turbulence ( ct ) , and was originally developed in the field of superfluid helium .",
    "qt offers rich phenomena such as thermal counterflow @xcite , richardson cascade @xcite , kelvin wave cascade @xcite , the bottleneck effect @xcite , velocity statistics @xcite , and the reconnection of quantized vortices @xcite , leading to a deep understanding of turbulence , and it has been actively studied until today .",
    "recently , atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) have been providing a novel stage for turbulence studies in quantum fluids @xcite .",
    "this system has three advantages for investigating turbulence in quantum fluids .",
    "the first advantage is the experimental visualization of the density and vortex distribution @xcite , which gives us a large amount of information about turbulence .",
    "such an observation is difficult in superfluid helium , though the vortices have been visualized recently by use of tracer particles @xcite .",
    "the second advantage is the high controllability of the system by optical techniques @xcite , which enable us to change the shape of the quantum fluid and the interaction between particles .",
    "this can access new problems : the geometrical dependence of turbulence such as two - dimensional qt .",
    "this kind of study is being actively investigated .",
    "the third advantage is the realization of multicomponent becs such as binary @xcite and spinor becs @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamics in this kind of quantum fluid will give us novel physics , and investigations in this area have recently begun @xcite .",
    "thus , turbulence in the atomic becs can address exotic phenomena not found in superfluid helium .    at present",
    ", there is some research on turbulence in atomic becs , and most theoretical and numerical studies consider turbulence with many quantized vortices . in three- and two - dimensional systems , when many quantized vortices",
    "are nucleated , the kolmogorov @xmath2 power law is numerically confirmed in incompressible kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "recently , two - dimensional qt has been actively investigated , with discussion of features characteristic of two - dimensional systems such as inverse energy cascades @xcite , vortex clustering @xcite , negative temperature @xcite , and decay of vortex number @xcite .    in experiments ,",
    "some groups have succeeded in generating turbulence in atomic becs @xcite , where it has been possible to obtain turbulence with many quantized vortices .",
    "all these experimental studies focus on quantized vortices , investigating the anomalous expansion @xcite , vortex dynamics @xcite , annihilation of vortices @xcite , and so on . however , the kinetic - energy spectrum corresponding to a two - point correlation function of the velocity field has not yet been observed , and we can not confirm the kolmogorov @xmath2 power law .",
    "this means that kolmogorov turbulence has not been observed .",
    "let us elucidate the meaning of kolmogorov turbulence .",
    "in the usual hydrodynamic turbulence ( ht ) , the vortices give important structures , whose dynamics generates the @xmath2 power law in the kinetic - energy spectrum due to a constant - flux cascade for the kinetic energy .",
    "however , in other systems , various power laws appear as a result of the constant - flux cascade for some quantity such as the wave energy , wave action , and so on . in these cases ,",
    "the common physics for the appearance of the power law is the constant - flux cascade . in this paper , we call such turbulence with the constant - flux cascade kolmogorov turbulence . in the turbulence study",
    ", it would be very important to observe kolmogorov turbulence ; however , observing the superfluid velocity directly in turbulence of atomic becs is difficult , so we can not confirm whether kolmogorov turbulence appears as of now .    to shed light on the above problem , we focus on weak wave turbulence ( wt ) with a strong condensate in atomic becs because the density profile of the bec is observable and thus plays an important role in observing kolmogorov turbulence . in this turbulence ,",
    "bogoliubov waves are significant , so we call it bogoliubov - wave turbulence in this paper",
    ".    originally , in classical fluids , wt , which is turbulent flow dominated by waves , has been studied @xcite .",
    "it is much different from ht because vortex structures are regarded as important in ht @xcite .",
    "there are weak and strong kinds of wt , depending on whether the nonlinearity is weak or strong . in weak wt ,",
    "a constant - flux cascade of wave energy or wave action generates power - law behaviors in the spectrum , and kolmogorov turbulence is known to occur in various wave systems such as those involving fluid surfaces ( gravity and capillary waves ) @xcite , magnetic substances ( spin waves ) @xcite , and elastic media ( acoustic waves ) @xcite .",
    "we expect that it is possible to confirm kolmogorov turbulence in atomic becs by the observation of the density profile in bogoliubov - wave turbulence . in this paper , by applying weak wt theory @xcite to the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation , we theoretically and numerically study the power - law behaviors for three spectra of a macroscopic wave function , density distribution , and bogoliubov wave distribution , discussing the experimental possibility for observing kolmogorov turbulence by means of the density spectrum .    there are some previous works on bogoliubov - wave turbulence in three - dimensional systems @xcite . in previous studies",
    "@xcite the @xmath0 power law in the bogoliubov - wave energy spectrum was analytically derived , and the equation of the fluctuation was derived with the assumption that the condensate function has a constant amplitude with a phase rotation induced by the chemical potential .",
    "subsequent work @xcite has suggested the @xmath0 power law in the spectrum for the macroscopic wave function and a result consistent with this power law was numerically obtained .",
    "we reconsider this bogoliubov - wave turbulence , analytically deriving the @xmath1 power law in the spectrum for the macroscopic wave function and numerically confirming this power law .",
    "we find that the condensate dynamics induced by the fluctuation , which is neglected in the previous studies , is important for bogoliubov - wave turbulence .",
    "furthermore , we focus on the spectrum for the density distribution , obtaining the @xmath0 power law , and discuss the experimental possibility of this power law .",

    "such a strong wt is the future work .",
    "in this section , we derive the three power exponents for @xmath22 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 . in sec . v a",
    ", we detail the difference between the power exponents in previous results and ours . in sec . v b ,",
    "we propose some conditions to observe kolmogorov turbulence in atomic becs and comment on the turbulence theory beyond the weak wt one .",
    "we consider that our result for @xmath21 may be the key to achieve this observation . in sec .",
    "v c , we discuss an inconsistency of our analytical calculation in sec .",
    "iii .      in a previous study @xcite , the spectrum of the macroscopic wave function",
    "was suggested to obey a @xmath0 power law in a three - dimensional system .",
    "however , our result has another @xmath1 power law .    to discuss the reason for this difference , we review the derivation of the @xmath0 power law in this previous paper @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "zahkarov and nazarenko studied bogoliubov - wave turbulence using the two canonical variables @xmath160 and @xmath161 with @xmath162 . to study the fluctuation around the strong condensate",
    ", they took expressions @xmath163 and @xmath164 , where the quantity @xmath165 corresponds to the condensate and @xmath166 and @xmath167 correspond to the fluctuations . by using the following canonical transformation for these canonical variables",
    ", they introduced new canonical variables @xmath168 , diagonalizing a one - body hamiltonian as @xmath169 the canonical variables @xmath168 were defined by @xmath170 @xmath171 with the fourier components @xmath172 $ ] and @xmath173 $ ] . here , note that @xmath174 is different from @xmath50 of eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian4 ] ) .",
    "then , they derived the @xmath0 power law in the bogoliubov - energy spectrum defined by @xmath175 the previous paper @xcite makes use of this power law to derive the power exponent of the spectrum for the macroscopic wave function . in this previous paper @xmath176",
    "is estimated as @xmath177 with @xmath178 .",
    "then , in the low - wave - number region , @xmath179 is approximately satisfied , so that they derived the @xmath0 power law in the spectrum @xmath20 for the macroscopic wave function .",
    "however , owing to the weak fluctuation , the macroscopic wave function @xmath3 can be expanded as @xmath180 by applying the fourier transformation to eq .",
    "( [ comp1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath181 as a result , in the low - wave - number region , the approximation used in weak wt theory gives @xmath182 which obviously leads to the @xmath1 power law in @xmath20 because @xmath183 .",
    "thus , the derivation of the @xmath0 power law for @xmath20 in the previous work @xcite seems not to be correct .      in atomic bec experiments",
    ", observations can be made of the density distribution , which accesses the spectrum @xmath21 .",
    "this can be the key to confirming the presence of kolmogorov turbulence ; if we can observe the @xmath0 power law in this spectrum , then kolmogorov turbulence is present .",
    "we discuss three points related to observing the @xmath0 power law in @xmath21 .",
    "the first point is that one must take a wide scaling region ; that is , one must prepare an atomic bec that is much larger than the coherence length .",
    "the @xmath0 power law appears in the low - wave - number region @xmath184 , but , in the trapped system , there is a limit on the system size of the order of the thomas - fermi radius @xmath185 .",
    "this scale can be the lower limit of the scaling region for the @xmath0 power law .",
    "thus , the radius @xmath185 should be at least a factor of 10 larger than @xmath186 .",
    "the second point concerns how to excite the system weakly in the low - wave - number region .",
    "the @xmath0 power law is valid under the weak nonlinearity condition @xmath153 , so that fluctuations of both density and phase should be very weak . in our calculation , the density fluctuation is about @xmath187 as shown in fig .",
    "however , this may be too weak to observe .",
    "we must investigate the spectrum dependence on the strength of the fluctuation , for instance , the condition at which the prediction of weak wt theory is broken ; this , however , is a subject of future work . also , it is necessary to excite a large - scale modulation because the @xmath0 power law results from the direct energy cascade .",
    "thus , candidates for the excitation are considered to be repulsive or attractive gaussian potentials moving slower than the sound velocity or a shaking trapping potential with fixed frequency . however",
    ", the excitation mode induced by these methods should depend on size , strength , and the velocity of the gaussian potential or frequency and displacement of the shaking , etc .",
    "understanding the excitation methods is essential for observing kolmogorov turbulence in atomic becs and should be numerically investigated hereafter .",
    "the third point is that one must take surface effects into consideration . in a three - dimensional system ,",
    "we can obtain the density distribution integrated along the incident direction of the probe light , so that this distribution contains information of the surface profile as well as the bulk .",
    "since our result should be applicable to the bulk of the trapped bec , the surface effect may alter the power law of eq .",
    "( [ w_d_p_rel4 ] ) .",
    "if the system size is much larger than the damping length of the surface wave into the bulk @xcite , this power law is expected to be relevant .    finally",
    ", we comment on turbulence theory beyond weak wt theory .",
    "recently , yoshida and arimitsu have studied strong turbulence with the spectral closure approximation , deriving the some power exponents @xcite .",
    "these power exponents have not been confirmed numerically .",
    "these power laws may be another key to confirmation of kolomogorov turbulence in atomic becs because , in this theory , the fluctuation is large and it is easy to observe .      in sec .",
    "iii and appendix a , we apply weak wt theory to eqs .",
    "( [ density_equ ] ) and ( [ bogo_equ ] ) , obtaining eq .",
    "( [ kin_equ1 ] ) . however , this derivation has an inconsistency for the perturbative expansion in eqs .",
    "( [ gp_condensate ] ) and ( [ gp_fluctuation2 ] ) . in this expansion , we keep the second order of the fluctuation @xmath188 in both equations , which is not consistent because the right - hand sides of eqs .",
    "( [ gp_condensate ] ) and ( [ gp_fluctuation2 ] ) are the first and second order of smallness , respectively . to do a reliable expansion",
    ", we must take the third order of @xmath188 in eq .",
    "( [ gp_fluctuation2 ] ) , but this calculation is very difficult .",
    "our numerical calculation exhibits that the condensate dynamics is different from @xmath46 , so that we must take the nonlinear dynamics for @xmath29 . in this paper , although our calculation contains the inconsistency for the perturbative expansion , we treat the coupled nonlinear dynamics for the condensate and the fluctuation . thus , our theory for this coupled dynamics is insufficient .",
    "the construction of the improved theory is the future work . in spite of this inconsistency , the analytical results exhibit good agreement with the numerical results .    as another possibility",
    ", our numerical calculation seems not to be substantially satisfied with the weak nonlinear condition .",
    "however , if we use the weaker fluctuation , the computational time for the formation of the power law is much longer , which can not be confirmed at present .",
    "we have theoretically and numerically studied bogoliubov - wave turbulence in a uniform bec at zero temperature by using the gp equation .",
    "our application of weak wt theory to the gp equation leads to the three power exponents @xmath159 , @xmath1 , and @xmath189 corresponding to the spectra for the bogoliubov - wave distribution @xmath22 , the macroscopic wave function @xmath20 , and the density distribution @xmath21 . by numerically calculating the gp equation , we have confirmed the good agreement with these power exponents . in our analytical and numerical calculation , we found that taking account of the condensate dynamics coupled with the fluctuation , an aspect not treated in previous works @xcite , was important .",

    "iii c , the terms with @xmath60 are neglected .",
    "we calculate the canonical variable @xmath197 and the condensate density @xmath69 at @xmath196 up to the second order of @xmath200 by using the perturbative expansion : @xmath206 @xmath207 from eqs .",

    "( [ ap1 ] ) because such terms lead to the third order of @xmath200 in eq .",
