    "the existence of the gunn - peterson absorption trough in the spectra of the highest redshift qsos ( @xmath0 ) suggests that hydrogen in the early universe is significantly neutral ( @xmath1 in mass average ; e.g. , @xcite ; see also @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , hydrogen in the vicinity of the qsos may be highly ionized by ionizing photons from qsos ( i.e. , the proximity effect ; e.g. , @xcite ) , as indicated in the qso spectra by the transmission of flux at wavelengths between the gunn - peterson trough and the ly@xmath3 line center .",
    "these highly ionized regions around the qsos are generally idealized as spherical in the rest frame of the qso and called strmgren spheres .",

    "observers on earth perceive an object ( here the highly ionized region ) by the light reaching earth at the same moment . since the speed of light is finite , the apparent shape of the expanding ionization front around the qso may not be spherical .",
    "@xcite show that the ionization fronts along the line of sight and transverse to it may have different observed sizes ( see also discussions on the size along the line of sight in @xcite and related discussions in @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we generalize the time - delay effect to all angles around the highest redshift qsos and illustrate the expected apparent shape of the surrounding ionization front and its evolution ( for the relativistic time - delay effects in other astrophysical contexts , e.g. , see also @xcite ) .",
    "we show how the shape depends on the qso luminosity evolution and its environment ( such as the neutral hydrogen fraction and clumpiness ) .",

    "suppose that the nuclear activity of the qso is triggered at cosmic time @xmath7 .",

    "if photons emitted from ( or passing through ) the ionization front , e.g. , point @xmath12 in figure  [ fig : f1 ] , reach the distant observer at the same time as photons from the qso , the photons from @xmath12 should be emitted from ( or pass through ) @xmath12 at cosmic time t_a = t(z_q)+r(t_a)/c , 0 , [ eq : ta ] where @xmath13 is the qso redshift , @xmath14 is the cosmic time corresponding to @xmath13 , @xmath15 is the speed of light , and @xmath16 is the angle between @xmath17 and the observer s line of sight @xmath18 ( see fig .

    "they should emit from the qso @xmath5 at an earlier time t_o = t_a - r(t_a)/c .",
    "[ eq : to ] given any @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , the solution of equation ( [ eq : to ] ) @xmath19 is unique since the expansion speed of @xmath22 is slower than @xmath15 .",

    "because of the existence of the term `` @xmath32 '' in the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq : geom ] ) , the apparent shape @xmath33 is neither a spheroid ( the apparent shape of relativistically expanding spherical shell of radio sources discussed in @xcite ) unless @xmath28 is a linear function of @xmath24 nor a `` light - echo '' paraboloid around a nova or supernova @xcite .",
    "we define the apparent radial expansion speed of the ionization front at a given @xmath16 by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the comoving distance of @xmath31 and @xmath36 is the time interval measured by the observer with including the effect of the cosmological time dilation . according to equations ( [ eq : ta])([eq : geom ] ) , the apparent radial expansion speed of the ionization front in units of @xmath15 at a given @xmath16 is given by @xmath37 note that the physical expansion speed of the ionization front in the qso rest frame is dr / dt_a=(dr / d)/(1+c^-1dr / d)<c , [ eq : drdta ] which is consistent with special relativity that real information does not travel faster than the speed of light . if @xmath38 is highly relativistic , the apparent expansion is superluminal at sufficiently small @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is close to @xmath41 when @xmath42 .",
    "we can also define the apparent transverse expansion speed in units of @xmath15 through @xmath43 , which gives the conventionally transverse superluminal phenomenon at sufficiently small @xmath16 if @xmath44 . according to equation ( [ eq : speed ] )",
    ", the lower limit on the qso lifetime can be constrained simply by the apparent sizes of the ionization front , e.g. , @xmath45 or @xmath46 .",
    "we denote the mean neutral hydrogen fraction in the region surrounding the qso prior to the triggering of its nuclear activity by @xmath48 ( @xmath49 several percent to 1020% in @xcite ; and the rest of the hydrogen has been ionized by stars or collisionally ionized in large halos ; also cf . , @xcite or for a higher fraction @xcite ) , where @xmath50 is the average proper number density of neutral hydrogen and @xmath51 is the density of total hydrogen .",
    "after the nuclear activity is triggered , the expansion of the ionization front ( or the strmgren sphere ) in the rest frame of the qso as a function of @xmath24 ( not as a function of @xmath19 here ) may be described by the following equation ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) : = ( ) -_bc n^2 r^3 , [ eq : stromevol ] where @xmath52 is the ionizing photon emission rate of the qso at its age @xmath24 , @xmath53(@xmath54 at @xmath55k ) is the hydrogen recombination coefficient to excited levels of hydrogen , @xmath56 is the clumping factor describing the effective clumpiness of hydrogen ionized by qso photons , and `` @xmath57 '' represents the space average over the sphere with radius @xmath31 .",
    "note that here @xmath58 is a little different from the conventional definition of @xmath59 .",
    "the second term on the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq : stromevol ] ) accounts for the recombination of ionized hydrogen within the strmgren sphere . in equation ( [ eq : stromevol ] )",
    "we set the parameters ( @xmath60 ) to be the values at cosmic time @xmath61 , and their changes during the time interval @xmath62 of the qso photon propagation in the strmgren sphere have been assumed to be negligible . for simplicity , we also neglect their dependence on @xmath31 and set them to be constants in the calculations below .",
    "thus , the solution of equation ( [ eq : stromevol ] ) is given by r()=^1/3 , [ eq : rsol ] where the recombination timescale & & x(c n_b)^-1 + & & 410 ^ 6 ( ) ( ) ( ) ^3 [ eq : trec ] characterizes the role of the recombination term in equation ( [ eq : stromevol ] ) .",
    "the physical expansion of the ionization front in the rest frame of the qso @xmath38 was discussed in @xcite by accounting for finite light travel time and ignoring the recombination terms , and was generalized in equation ( 1 ) of @xcite . here applying equation ( [ eq : stromevol ] ) into equation ( [ eq : drdta ] ) , we obtain the physical expansion of the ionization front as follows : = c , where @xmath63 . at @xmath64",

    "[ eq : geom ] ) and thus @xmath66 is simply @xmath67 ; at @xmath68 we have @xmath69 and thus @xmath66 is simply @xmath70 .",
    "note that in principle the apparent ionization front at @xmath68 may not necessarily correspond to the maximum angle of the apparent ionized region extended on the sky ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] ) .    note that in equation ( [ eq : stromevol ] ) @xmath52 is a non - decreasing function of @xmath24 so that @xmath28 expands with increasing @xmath24 .",
    "when @xmath52 decreases with increasing @xmath24 ( e.g. , close to the quenching of the qso nuclear activity ) and @xmath71 , the ionization front shrinks , and its evolution may not be described by equation ( [ eq : stromevol ] ) if the characteristic decreasing timescale of @xmath52 is significantly short compared to the recombination timescale . for simplicity , in this paper",
    "we ignore the decreasing phase of the qso luminosity evolution , which has been shown to at least not dominate the main population of luminous qsos observed at relatively low redshifts @xcite .",
    "below we assume two simple models of @xmath52 ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "as the ionization front expands , if @xmath71 ( and @xmath80 in model ii ) , the recombination within the highly ionized hii region is approximately balanced by the emission of the ionizing photons from the qso , and we have r ( ) . which is insensitive to the detailed value of @xmath24 for model ( i ) and depends on @xmath24 only through @xmath81 in model ( ii ) . in case that @xmath82 in model ( ii ) , @xmath28 at @xmath83 still follows equation ( [ eq : strom2s ] ) , but",
    "the effect of recombination is not important and @xmath28 is mainly determined by the qso emission .",
    "given equation ( [ eq : strom2s ] ) , for the exponential increase of the luminosity evolution in model ( ii ) , the changing rate of @xmath28 with @xmath24 is larger than @xmath15 if @xmath84 .",
    "by combining equations ( [ eq : geom ] ) and ( [ eq : rsol ] ) , we obtain the evolution of the apparent shape of the ionization front ( @xmath26 ) for different models of the qso luminosity evolution , which is shown in figure  [ fig : model1 ] .",
    "the evolution of the apparent shape and size depends on the qso luminosity evolution and its environment ( e.g. , the hydrogen reionization history or structure formation ) through the parameters ( @xmath85 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : model1 ] , the parameters ( @xmath86 ) are set so that @xmath87 is larger in the right panels than in the left ones .",
    "top panels ( a ) and ( b ) are for model ( i ) of @xmath52 . as seen from them , the apparent shapes of the ionization fronts are generally not a sphere , especially if @xmath30 is short ( inner curves ) and @xmath87 is large ( e.g. , because @xmath88 is high or @xmath89 is low ; right panel ) .",
    "the apparent shape expands as @xmath30 increases .",
    "when @xmath30 is long enough , the apparent shape at small @xmath16 ( see the definition of @xmath16 in fig .  [",
    "fig : f1 ] ) starts to be almost independent of @xmath30 and approaches a sphere , since the radius of the strmgren sphere approaches the equilibrium value @xmath90 ( eq .  [ eq : strom2 ] ) at which the ionizing photon emission is balanced by the recombination . with increasing @xmath30 , the shape at large @xmath16 continues to expand and",
    "finally the whole apparent shape becomes spherical ( see the outmost curve in panel a ) . according to equation ( [ eq : rs ] ) , the stronger the @xmath88 or the smaller the @xmath58 , the larger the final equilibrium sphere radius .",
    "in addition , in case that @xmath87 is significantly small ( @xmath91 ) , the expansion may become non - relativistic at a time much earlier than @xmath92 , thus the apparent shape may approach a sphere even if @xmath93 ( but @xmath94 ) . figure  [ fig : model1]c - f illustrate the apparent shapes for model ( ii ) of @xmath52 , where the timescales of increasing luminosity are set to have @xmath95 and 3 , respectively . in model",
    "( ii ) the size of the apparent shape is sensitive to @xmath30 even if @xmath30 is long because @xmath96 increases with time exponentially ; and the shape does not evolve towards a spherical shape , especially if @xmath97 is small ( bottom panels e - f ) .    for the realistic case of the highest redshift qsos with gunn - peterson troughs observed so far ( @xmath98 ; @xcite ) , @xcite study the environmental effect of their surrounding regions and obtain @xmath99 and @xmath10040 ( which are shown to be consistent with the observed strmgren radii ) .",
    "then the recombination timescale @xmath101 is @xmath102 ( eq .  [ eq : trec ] ) , which is significantly shorter than the qso lifetime ( @xmath103 ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus the ages of most observed qsos should be long enough that the sizes of the ionization fronts along the line of sight are close to the equilibrium values . for the observed qsos with @xmath104 , the apparent size at @xmath64",
    "is @xmath105(@xmath106 ) @xcite , and the apparent shapes should be close to the outer curves shown in figure  [ fig : model1]a and c ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : aniso ] if the qso emission is anisotropic ) .",
    "statistically a small fraction of observed qsos would also have significantly short ages and the apparent shapes of their ionization fronts should systematically deviate from a spherical shape ( see the inner curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : model1 ] ) .",

    "panel ( a ) is for model ( i ) of @xmath96 and panel ( b ) for model ( ii ) .",
    "as seen from figure  [ fig : speed ] , the speed is superluminal at small @xmath16 and @xmath110 . for the specific case of @xmath64 , we have @xmath65 and @xmath111 ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : geom ] and [ eq : betaapp ] ) , and the corresponding superluminal expansion is also mentioned or discussed in some recent literature @xcite . in panel",
    "( b ) , the speed at small @xmath16 may also become superluminal even at large @xmath110 because the ionizing photon emission rate and @xmath28 ( eq .  [ eq : strom2s ] ) increases exponentially in model ( ii ) .",
    "the expansion of the highly ionized regions around the highest redshift qsos with gunn - peterson troughs provides another astrophysical example of the superluminal phenomenon ( for other examples , e.g. , see reviews in @xcite ) .",
    "in the above , qso ionizing photons have been assumed to be emitted isotropically .",
    "however , in reality the qso emission may be anisotropic at least in these two cases : ( i ) a torus is surrounding the central black hole in the qso , which blocks the ionizing photons from the central engine ; ( ii ) the uv ionizing photon emission from the accretion disk surrounding the black hole is anisotropic ( see also discussions of the effects of anisotropy of qso emission in @xcite and @xcite ) .    in case ( i ) , the highly ionized region in the rest frame of the qso may appear simply like a large - scale version of the [ oiii ] ionization `` cone '' detected in local seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "the expected apparent shape is easily correspondingly adjusted depending on the normal direction and the opening angle of the torus .    in case ( ii ) , we assume that the emergent intensity from the accretion disk is @xmath112 because of the limb - darkening effect ( e.g. , @xcite ) , where @xmath113 is the cosine of the angle between the disk normal and the emitting direction ( so far there is no much evidence to show that uv photons from qsos are strongly beamed ) . here",
    "the qso anisotropic emission is symmetric about the disk plane and axisymmetric about the disk normal .",
    "although both the relativistic time - delay and the anisotropy of the qso emission may make the apparent shape deviate from a spherical shape , their effects are different . as mentioned above ,",
    "the time - delay effect decreases @xmath28 with increasing @xmath16 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : geom ] ) and does not break the rotational symmetry of the ionized region about the observer s line of sight @xmath18 . for the anisotropic effect here , the detailed dependence of the apparent size on @xmath16 is significantly affected by the detailed geometric configuration between the accretion disk and the observer . the rotational symmetry of the apparent shape around the observer s line of sight is generally broken unless the disk normal is coincident with the observer s line of sight .",
    "we denote the angle between the disk normal and the observer s line of sight by @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) . for @xmath116 ,",
    "the cross sections of the apparent ionized region are illustrated in figure  [ fig : aniso ] , where the observer s line of sight is on the cross section , @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) is the angle of the cross section anti - clockwise from the plane in which @xmath18 and the disk normal are located , and @xmath119 .",
    "although in general @xmath28 does not necessarily decrease with increasing @xmath16 if the qso emission is anisotropic , the apparent size in any direction from the central qso with @xmath120 is still systematically not larger than the size in the opposite direction because of the time - delay effect and the symmetry assumed for the anisotropic emission here .",
    "given the detailed discussions in ",
    "[ sec : results ] , if the qso age is significantly long compared to the hydrogen recombination process and the qso luminosity evolution is significantly slow , the apparent ionized region follows the same symmetry as the qso emission ( i.e. , symmetric about the disk plane and axisymmetric about the disk normal here ) .",
    "as seen from figure  [ fig : aniso ] , the smaller the @xmath110 and the smaller the @xmath114 , the less important the anisotropic effect .",
    "we use figure  [ fig : f1 ] to illustrate the possible observational tests of the apparent shape . the discussion below may be generalized to the anisotropic case of qso emission .",
    "if there exists a background object @xmath121 behind the highly ionized region ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] ) , significant transmission of ly@xmath3 ( and/or ly@xmath122 ) photons may be present on the gunn - peterson trough in the observational spectrum of @xmath121 at wavelengths corresponding to redshifts @xmath123 to @xmath124 [ somewhat like ( but it may be much broader than ) the observed emission spike on top of the gunn - peterson trough of sdss j1148 + 5251 ; see figs .  4 or 5 in @xcite ] .",
    "similarly , the spectra of background objects lying inside the highly ionized regions ( see also discussions for inside objects in @xcite ) may also show transmission features of ly@xmath3 photons at the wavelength corresponding to the redshift when its light travels out of the ionized region .",
    "if the background object is the qso itself , we have @xmath65 at @xmath64 ( eq .  [ eq : geom ] ) and the size of the apparent ionization front @xmath125 , which can be measured directly from the wavelength difference between the gunn - peterson trough and the ly@xmath3 line center in the qso spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "note that the existence of ly@xmath3 emitting galaxies lying behind or inside the highly ionized regions of the highest redshift qsos is likely and detection of them is possible by current techniques , since the apparent `` strmgren sphere '' with a physical size @xmath126 at @xmath6 covers an area about @xmath127 on the sky and is large enough for this compared to the survey areas of some ly@xmath3 surveys ( see table 1 in @xcite ) that have successfully discovered galaxies at @xmath128 . by obtaining observational spectra of a number of background sources with different projecting distances ( @xmath129 ) to the highest redshift qso(s ) , one can measure the proper distance of @xmath130 ( or @xmath131 , @xmath132 ) for each source behind the region(s ) ( or @xmath132 for inside sources ) and then statistically map the three - dimensional apparent shape of the highly ionized region(s ) surrounding the qso(s ) .",
    "the distribution of these distances as a function of @xmath133 may be used to statistically constrain the evolution of the apparent ionization fronts ( and hence the qso luminosity evolution and its environment ) , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : ratio ] .",
    "in addition , the apparent shape of the highly ionized region surrounding the qsos with gunn - peterson troughs might also be revealed by radio surveys of the hyperfine transition @xmath2 line emission of neutral hydrogen ( e.g. , the low frequency array , the square kilometer array , the primeval structure telescope , the mileura wide - field array ) , a possible technique to map the neutral hydrogen distribution at high redshift ( see discussions in * ? ? ? * ) .    for the observer on earth",
    ", the physical distance of @xmath134 can be obtained by @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the angular diameter distance to the qso and @xmath137 is the angle of the qso and the ionization front ( e.g. , point @xmath12 ) separated on the sky .",
    "the transformation of the angular and the redshift space to real space ( @xmath134 and @xmath130 , @xmath131 or @xmath132 etc . ) depends on the cosmological parameters . if the qso age and environment are effectively constrained by the apparent ionization front ( through @xmath138 , @xmath139 etc . ) at small @xmath140 and if the anisotropy of qso emission is effectively constrained by some cross sections of the apparent ionized region , the apparent physical sizes of the ionized region at other directions may be predicted by using the method in this paper .",
    "thus , the ratio of the redshift difference between the qso and the apparent ionization front at @xmath140 to the maximum angle(s ) of the apparent ionized region ( or cross sections ) extended on the sky might be used to provide constraints on the cosmological parameter @xmath4 by the alcock - paczyski test @xcite , since the angular size significantly depends on @xmath4 but the redshift size does not at @xmath6 .",
    "in this paper we have illustrated the apparent shape of the ionization front around the highest redshift qsos , and its evolution , with gunn - peterson troughs in the spectra .",
    "we have shown that the apparent shape and its evolution depend on the age and the luminosity evolution of the qso , the recombination process of ionized hydrogen surrounding the qso , and the anisotropic property of the qso emission . both the relativistic time - delay effect and the anisotropy of qso emission may make the apparent shape deviate from a sphere .",
    "the time - delay effect systematically makes the apparent size of the ionization front in the directions away from the observer smaller than the size in the directions towards the observer .",
    "the deviation of the shape caused by the time - delay effect is not significant if the qso age is significantly long compared to the hydrogen recombination process within the ionization front and the qso luminosity evolution is significantly slow .",
    "the time - delay effect does not break the rotational symmetry of the ionized region about the observer s line of sight to the qso .",
    "the apparent expansion of the ionization front may be superluminal at the early stage of its expansion or if the qso ionizing photon emission rate increases dramatically ( e.g. , exponentially ) . the anisotropic effect on the apparent shape",

    "<S> although the highest redshift qsos ( @xmath0 ) are embedded in a significantly neutral background universe ( mass - averaged neutral hydrogen fraction @xmath1 ) as suggested by the gunn - peterson absorption troughs in their spectra , the intergalactic medium in their vicinity is highly ionized . </S>",
    "<S> the highly ionized region is generally idealized as spherical and called the strmgren sphere . in this paper , by combining the expected evolution of the strmgren sphere with the rule that the speed of light is finite , we illustrate the apparent shape of the ionization fronts around the highest redshift qsos and its evolution , which depends on the age , luminosity evolution , and environment of the qso ( e.g. , the hydrogen reionization history ) . </S>",
    "<S> the apparent shape may systematically deviate from a spherical shape , unless the qso age is significantly long compared to the hydrogen recombination process within the ionization front and the qso luminosity evolution is significantly slow . </S>",
    "<S> effects of anisotropy of qso emission are also discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the apparent shape of the `` strmgren sphere '' may be directly mapped by transmitted spectra of background sources behind or inside the ionized regions or by surveys of the hyperfine transition ( @xmath2 ) line emission of neutral hydrogen . </S>"
