    "the possible existence of nanoscale electronic inhomogeneity  the propensity of charge carriers doped into the cuo@xmath1 plane to form nanoscale structures  has drawn much attention in the field of high-@xmath0  superconductivity .",
    "neutron scattering studies on nd co - doped la@xmath7sr@xmath8cuo@xmath9 ( nd - lsco )  @xcite and stm / sts studies on bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath3  ( bi2212 )  @xcite have led to suggestions that such self - organization may manifest itself as one - dimensional `` stripes '' in nd - lsco , or two - dimensional `` patches '' in bi2212 . in the former case ,",
    "the inter - stripe spacing in the superconducting regime is reported to be approximately four times the in - plane lattice constant , about 1.5 nm , and in the latter case the patches are estimated to be 1 - 3 nm across .",
    "many theoretical studies suggest that the spatial electronic inhomogeneity in the hole - doped cuo@xmath1 planes is an essential part of high-@xmath0  physics  @xcite .",
    "however , at present , the importance of , or even the existence of generic nanoscale electronic inhomogeneity remains controversial  @xcite .",
    "if nanoscale electronic inhomogeneity exists in the superconducting cuprates , the doped holes will distribute themselves in the cuo@xmath1 planes so as to minimize their total energy . in real materials ,",
    "the cuo@xmath1 planes are usually inhomogeneous due to local lattice distortions and/or the random coulomb potential resulting from chemical disorder , which differs from system to system .",
    "therefore , even if electronic inhomogeneity may itself be a genuine property of doped cuo@xmath1 planes , the spatial variation of doped holes will likely depend on the details of each material .",
    "for example , in the framework of the stripe model  @xcite , incommensurate spin and charge correlations are stabilized in nd - lsco by the long - range distortion of the cuo@xmath10 octahedra in the low - temperature tetragonal phase , which creates one - dimensional potential wells . for bi2212 , it is argued that the random coulomb potential caused by excess oxygen atoms in the bio planes pins the doped holes , thus creating patch - shaped inhomogeneities  @xcite .",
    "these observations suggest that _ electronic and chemical inhomogeneity are inseparable from each other _ , and that the understanding of the latter is imperative for an understanding of the former .",
    "motivated by this line of reasoning , we have examined the effects of chemical inhomogeneity in single - layer bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cuo@xmath6 ( bi2201 ) and double - layer bi2212 .",
    "although widely used for surface sensitive measurements such as stm  @xcite and angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes )  @xcite , a detailed understanding of their materials properties is very limited , when compared to other materials such as lsco or yba@xmath1cu@xmath11o@xmath12 .",
    "the bi - based cuprates contain excess oxygens in bio planes and one can change their carrier concentration by changing the amount , @xmath13 .",
    "the excess oxygen would engender a random coulomb potential in the cuo@xmath1 planes .",
    "besides the oxygen nonstoichiometry in bio planes , there exists another source of chemical inhomogeneity which inherently exists in typical samples .",
    "although referred to as bi2201 and bi2212 , it is empirically known that stoichiometric bi@xmath14sr@xmath14cuo@xmath15 and bi@xmath14sr@xmath14cacu@xmath1o@xmath16 are very difficult to synthesize  @xcite , even in a polycrystalline form . in order to more easily form the crystal structure ,",
    "one usually replaces sr@xmath17 ions by trivalent ions , such as excess bi@xmath18 ions or la@xmath18 ions , forming bi@xmath19sr@xmath7cuo@xmath15 , bi@xmath1sr@xmath7la@xmath20cuo@xmath15 , and bi@xmath19sr@xmath7cacu@xmath1o@xmath16 . as listed up in ref .",
    ", a typical bi : sr nonstoichiometry , @xmath21 , for bi2212 is around 0.1 , which yields a @xmath22=89 - 91k . to our knowledge , the highest @xmath22 reported in the literature is 95k ( ref . ( g),(i ) )",
    ". for bi2201 , @xmath22 of bi@xmath19sr@xmath7cuo@xmath15 is around 10k for @xmath21(bi)@xmath23 , whereas la substituted bi2201 ( bi@xmath1sr@xmath7la@xmath20cuo@xmath15 ) has a higher @xmath2430k for @xmath21(la)@xmath25  @xcite .",
    "since the sr atom is located next to the apical oxygen which is just above the cu atoms , the effect of sr site ( also referred to as the a - site ) cation inhomogeneity is expected to be stronger than that of the excess oxygens in bio planes .",
    "note that bio planes are located relatively far away from cuo@xmath1 planes , with sro planes in between .    in this study",
    ", we evaluate the effect of chemical inhomogeniety in the bi - based cuprates . for bi2201",
    ", we have grown a series of bi@xmath1sr@xmath4ln@xmath5cuo@xmath15 crystals with various trivalent rare earth ( ln ) ions . in this series",
    ", the magnitude of the local lattice distortion can be changed systematically by making use of the different ionic radii of the substituted ln ions .",
    "we find that @xmath0   monotonically decreases with increasing ionic radius mismatch . for bi2212 ,",
    "a series of bi@xmath19sr@xmath7cacu@xmath1o@xmath16 crystals with varying values of @xmath21 were grown in order to evaluate the effect of bi : sr nonstoichiometry .",
    "in addition , we also have grown bi@xmath1sr@xmath1ca@xmath26y@xmath27cu@xmath1o@xmath16 , and find that substitution of y for ca site helps to enforce bi : sr stoichiometry and to raise @xmath0  to 96 k for @xmath28 .",
    "our results demonstrate that the cation disorder , in particular that located at the sr site , significantly affects the maximum attainable @xmath0(@xmath29 )  in the bi - based superconductors . in order to explain our results we use a conceptual hierarchy that classifies and ranks the principal kinds of chemical disorder possible in these systems .",
    "we then extend our arguments to other cuprates to examine whether a general trend exists in the hole - doped high-@xmath22 superconductors .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section ii contains detailed information about sample preparation and characterization .",
    "the experimental results are presented in section iii and discussed in section iv , while the effects of disorder in other cuprates is addressed in section v.",
    "single crystals of bi2201 and bi2212 were grown using the travelling - solvent floating - zone technique , which is now the preferred method for synthesizing high - purity single crystals of many transition metal oxides .",
    "this technique allows for greater control of the growth conditions than is possible either by standard solid state reactions or by the flux method .",
    "powders of bi@xmath1o@xmath11 , srco@xmath11 , caco@xmath11 , ln@xmath1o@xmath11 ( ln = la , pr , nd , sm , eu , gd , y ) , and cuo ( all of 99.99% or higher purity ) were well dried and mixed in the desired cation ratio ( bi : sr : ln : cu=@xmath30 for bi2201 and bi : sr : ca : cu=@xmath31 for bi2212 ) , and then repeatedly calcinated at about 800@xmath32c with intermediate grinding . eventually , the powder was finely ground and formed into a 100 mm long rod with a diameter of 5 mm .",
    "the crystal growth was performed using a crystal systems inc . infrared radiation furnace",
    "equipped with four 150 w halogen lamps . except for nearly - stoichiometric ( @xmath33 ) bi2212",
    ", the rods were premelted at 18 mm / h to form dense feed rods .",
    "the crystal growth was carried out without the use of a solvent and at a growth speed of 0.3 - 0.4 mm / h for bi2201 and 0.15 - 0.2 mm / h for bi2212 .",
    "the growth atmospheres adopted for the bi2212 growth are listed in table 1 .",
    "bi2201 single crystals were grown in 1 atm of flowing o@xmath1 .",
    "the growth condition for the @xmath33 bi2212 sample was more stringent than for the other samples . in order to obtain homogeneous polycrystalline feed rods ,",
    "a mixture of starting powders with the stoichiometric ratio bi : sr : ca : cu=2:2:1:2 was calcinated in stages , at temperatures increasing from 770@xmath32c to 870@xmath32c in 10@xmath32c increments , with intermediate grindings .",
    "the final calcination temperature ( 870@xmath32c ) was set to be just below the composition s melting temperature ( 875@xmath32c ) .",
    "the duration of each calcination was about 20 hours . to avoid possible compositional fluctuation in the feed rod , instead of premelting ,",
    "the feed rod was sintered four times in the floating - zone furnace at a speed of 50 mm / h . this process allowed us to obtain dense feed rods , approximately 95% of the ideal density .",
    "the atmosphere required for stable crystal growth was @xmath34 o@xmath1 , a range much narrower than for nonstoichiometric or y - doped bi2212 .",
    "the grown crystal rod contained small amounts of a single - crystalline srcuo@xmath1 secondary phase , indicating that the sample still suffers from bi : sr nonstoichiometry .",
    "single - phase bi2212 single crystals could be cleaved from the grown rod .",
    "no traces of impurity phases were found in other compositions .",
    "inductively coupled plasma ( icp ) spectroscopy was carried out to determine the chemical compositions of the crystals .",
    "additional electron - probe microanalysis ( epma ) was also carried out on the bi2201 crystals .",
    "the results confirm that the actual compositions follow the nominal compositions , as listed in table 1 for bi2212 .",
    "hereafter , we basically denote the samples by nominal composition to avoid confusion . in order to determine the maximum @xmath0  for each cation composition ( i.e. , to achieve optimal hole concentration ) ,",
    "the bi2212 samples were annealed at various temperatures and oxygen partial pressures using a tube furnace equipped with an oxygen monitor and a sample transfer arm , which allowed us to rapidly quench the annealed samples from high temperatures within a closed environment .",
    "this procedure ensures that the variation of @xmath0  among the samples is primarily due to cation nonstoichiometry and not due to differing hole concentrations .",
    "annealing conditions for obtaining optimal ( op ) , and typical underdoped ( ud ) and overdoped ( od ) samples are listed in table 1 .",
    "the results for bi2201 are on the as - grown crystals and accordingly may not exactly reflect @xmath29 .",
    "however , by carrying out a series of annealing studies , we have confirmed that the systematic change of @xmath0  among our samples is not due to different hole concentrations , but due to the different ln ions .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     superconducting transition temperatures were determined by ac susceptibility measurements using a quantum design physical properties measurement system ( ppms ) .",
    "the transition temperatures reported here correspond to the onset of a diamagnetic signal .",
    "we note that the different definition of @xmath0(such as the interecept between the superconducting transition slope and the @xmath35 axis ) does not affect our conclusions due to the sharp superconducting transition ( less than 2k for most samples ) , as shown below .",
    "although it is hard to determine the exact superconducting fraction due to the demagnetization factor of the plate - shaped crystals , the magnitude of the superconducting signal suggests the bulk superconductivity of the grown samples .",
    "no appreciable differences were observed between different samples from the same growth , or between different crystals prepared under identical conditions , an indication of the macroscopic homogeneity of the crystals and the reproducibility of our sample growth process .",
    "we have grown a series of ln@xmath18 substituted bi@xmath1sr@xmath4ln@xmath5cuo@xmath15 single crystals with ln = la , pr , nd , sm , eu , gd , bi . the ionic radius of ln@xmath18 ions , @xmath36 , decreases monotonically with increasing atomic number , 1.14   ( la@xmath18 ) , 1.06   ( pr@xmath18 ) , 1.04   ( nd@xmath18 ) , 1.00   ( sm@xmath18 ) , 0.98   ( eu@xmath18 ) , 0.97   ( gd@xmath18 ) , and 0.96   ( bi@xmath18)@xcite .",
    "accordingly , by introducing different ln ions , we can systematically change the ionic radius mismatch between sr@xmath17 ( 1.12  ) and ln@xmath18 .",

    "1(a ) , we show magnetic susceptibility data for a series of ln@xmath18 substituted samples grown under the same conditions . the @xmath0  of the la - doped sample was 33 k with a transition width of less than 1 k , a reasonable result for an as - grown crystal with this composition  @xcite . as shown in fig .",

    "there is no trace of superconductivity down to 1.8 k for the bi - substituted sample .",
    "this is reasonable , since the ionic radius of bi@xmath18 is the smallest of the ln ions , and the shape of the bi@xmath18 ion tends to be asymmetric due to the presence of a ( 6s)@xmath39 lone pair  @xcite , which might cause additional local lattice distortions .",
    "these observations demonstrate the strong sensitivity of @xmath0  to sr site substitution in bi2201 .",
    "although one can minimize the magnitude of the local lattice distortion through the choice of the la@xmath18 ion , which has a radius similar to that of sr@xmath17 , there remains another type of chemical disorder , that is , the random coulomb potential caused by heterovalent ion substitution . for lsco , @xmath40cu nqr spin - lattice relaxation rates experiments have revealed signatures for an electronic inhomogeniety and the results have been discussed in connection with the random distribution of sr@xmath17 ions@xcite . considering that both lsco and bi2201 contain a - site chemical disorder",

    "we will discuss this issue in more detail below .",
    "since cation substitution at the sr site has such a dramatic effect on @xmath0  in bi2201 , in particular for ln = bi , one might expect to find similar results for bi2212 . to verify this",

    ", width=264 ]    although @xmath0  of bi2212 can be raised by trying to enforce bi : sr stoichiometry , the preparation of nearly stoichiometric samples becomes much more difficult than when nonstoichiometry is allowed .",
    "this could be due to a greater stability of the crystal structure when it contains additional positive charges , which are usually introduced by allowing the bi@xmath18:sr@xmath17 ratio to be larger than one , as discussed in ref . .",
    "if this is indeed the case , one might expect to be able to synthesize higher-@xmath29  samples more easily by introducing extra positive charges via cation substitution that causes disorder less severe than substitution of bi@xmath18 ions at the sr site .",
    "in the case of bi2201 we observed that the substitution of additional ln atoms can eliminate excess bi atoms from the unfavorable sr site position , effectively lowering the magnitude of disorder and raising @xmath0 . in the double - layer material bi2212",
    ", there is an additional crystallographic site , the ca site located between the cuo@xmath1 planes , which can also accept trivalent dopant ions .",
    "one might expect ln@xmath18 ions at the ca site to be a weaker type of disorder than bi@xmath18 ions at the sr site , since there are no apical oxygens in the ca planes that could couple to cu atoms in the cuo@xmath1 planes .    to test this idea",
    "we have also grown y - substituted bi@xmath1sr@xmath1ca@xmath26y@xmath27cu@xmath1o@xmath16 crystals .",
    "we find that this compound is as easy to prepare as ordinary ( nonstoichiometric ) bi2212 , and that for y - bi2212 the bi : sr ratio indeed tends to be stoichiometric . furthermore , as shown in fig .",
    "2(d ) , @xmath29  for the @xmath28 sample was increased to 96.0 k , a value higher than for any other bi2212 sample reported in the literature.@xcite we also grew @xmath51 and @xmath52 samples and confirmed that @xmath29@xmath53 k in both cases .",
    "the effect on @xmath0  of structural distortions associated with cation substitution has been extensively studied in lsco - based materials  @xcite , and it is established that @xmath0   strongly depends on the a - site ( la site ) ionic radius mismatch .",
    "for instance , attfield _ et al .",
    "_ used simultaneous co - substitution of several alkaline earth and ln ions to hold the average a - site ionic radius constant while systematically controlling the variance of the a - site ionic radius , and found that @xmath0  is affected not just by the average radius , but also by the degree of disorder ( the variance ) at that crystallographic site .",
    "our study of single - layer bi2201 continues this line of inquiry to a different superconducting material and demonstrates a similar sensitivity of @xmath0  to a - site disorder .",
    "we note that our results qualitatively agree with those of a previous study on polycrystalline bi2201 samples@xcite .",
    "one can see the same trend in bi2212 crystals with varying degrees of chemical inhomogeniety . as expected , we find that @xmath0  is strongly dependent on the a - site disorder introduced by the bi : sr nonstoichiometry .",
    "furthermore , we also demonstrate that by the seemingly counter - intuitive method of introducing additional y@xmath18 ions , and hence a new type of disorder , we can raise @xmath29  to 96 k while minimizing a - site disorder .",
    "this suggests that , although the minimization of chemical disorder is important for raising @xmath0 , different types of disorder are not equally harmful .",
    "this is consistent with the observation @xcite that by carefully controlling disorder in the triple - layer material tlba@xmath1ca@xmath1cu@xmath11o@xmath54 ( tl1223 ) @xmath22 can be raised from @xmath55 k to 133.5 k , a new record for that system , and that ba site ( the a - site in this system ) cation disorder(deficiency ) has the strongest effect on @xmath0 .",
    "numerous experiments on bi2212 have suggested non - uniformity in its electronic properties .",
    "these include broad linewidths seen in inelastic neutron scattering experiments  @xcite , residual low - energy excitations in the superconducting state observed in penetration depth measurements  @xcite , finite spin susceptibility at low temperatures observed in nmr studies  @xcite , and short quasiparticle lifetimes detected by complex conductivity experiments  @xcite .",
    "the most recent of these are stm / sts measurements @xcite that purport to directly image patch - shaped , electronically inhomogeneous regions .",
    "the bi : sr nonstoichiometry which inherently exists in most samples may be partially responsible for these experimental observations .",
    "although the present results do not directly prove the presence of nanoscale electronic inhomogeneity , they can be taken as a circumstantial supporting evidence , since they successfully prove the existence of nanoscale chemical inhomogeneity which potentially pins down electronic inhomogeneity . to explain their stm / sts results , pan _",
    "et al._@xcite attribute the source of pinning centers to excess oxygen in the bio planes .",
    "although the overall framework addressed by pan _ et al .",
    "_ should still hold , we consider that the bi ions on the sr site are more effective as pinning centers since they are closer to the cuo@xmath1 planes and affect @xmath0  more directly . indeed , assuming a random distribution of bi ions on the sr site and a nonstoichiometry of @xmath56 , the average separation between bi ions is @xmath57 nm , comparable with the length scale observed in the stm / sts studies .",
    "recent @xmath58y nmr experiments on ybco indicate that the spatial inhomogeniety in this system is much less severe than in lsco or bi2212  @xcite .",
    "this is reasonable since the latter two systems exhibit a much higher degree of disorder located at the a - site ( la site ( lsco ) and sr site ( bi2212 ) ) , whereas ybco ( ba site ) is thought to be free from such cation disorder .",
    "indeed , recent penetration depth measurements on the ybco variant nd@xmath59ba@xmath7cu@xmath11o@xmath12 , with cationic disorder at the ba site , demonstrate that the superconducting properties of this system change quite sensitively with the degree of nd / ba nonstoichiometry  @xcite .",
    "the two main lessons to be learned from our bi2201 and bi2212 case studies are that ( 1 ) chemical inhomogeneity affects @xmath29  and that ( 2 ) the effect of disorder differs depending on its location . in the following , we attempt to classify the various sites at which chemical disorder is possible and categorize other superconducting families on the basis of which kind of disorder is prevalent in each system .    in fig .",
    "3 , we classify 25 cuprate superconductors based on the pattern of the chemical disorder and the number of cuo@xmath1 planes in the unit cell . @xcite in the first row , we illustrate three possible locations of chemical disorder relative to the cuo@xmath60 pyramids in multilayer materials , or to the cuo@xmath10 octahedra in single - layer materials . pattern ( a ) corresponds to the bi : sr nonstoichiometry in bi2201 and bi2212 , or sr@xmath17 ions doped into the la site in lsco , referred to as a - site disorder so far .",
    "the disorder is located next to the apical oxygen . pattern ( b ) corresponds to y@xmath18 substitution for ca@xmath17 in bi2212 and represents disorder located next to the cuo@xmath1 plane , but at a position where there are no apical oxygen atoms with which to bond .",
    "there is no corresponding ( b ) site in single - layer materials . pattern ( c ) disorder is further away from the cuo@xmath1 plane .",
    "we include excess oxygen @xmath13 in bi- and tl - based cuprates , oxygen defects in cuo chains in yba@xmath1cu@xmath11o@xmath12 , and hg deficiency @xmath61 as well as excess oxygen @xmath13 in hg@xmath26ba@xmath1ca@xmath62cu@xmath63o@xmath64 in this category .",
    "we note that the materials are catalogued based on the @xmath65 form of disorder that they are believed to exhibit .",
    "as demonstrated in the present case study , the effect of the chemical disorder is expected to be stronger for pattern ( a ) than for pattern ( b ) , which is reasonable considering the role of the apical oxygen atom in passing on the effect of disorder to nearby cu atoms .",
    "first , the random coulomb potential caused by type ( a ) disorder changes the energy levels of the apical oxygen orbitals , which can be transmitted to cuo@xmath1 planes through the hybridization between the apical o(2p@xmath66 ) orbital and the cu(3d@xmath67 ) orbital .",
    "second , the displacement of the apical oxygen caused by type ( a ) disorder brings about a local lattice distortion to the cuo@xmath1 planes .",
    "the effect of pattern ( c ) disorder is expected to be weakest since the disorder is located relatively far away from the cuo@xmath1 plane .",
    "the number of cuo@xmath1 planes per unit cell may be regarded as another parameter that , in effect , determines the magnitude of the chemical disorder . as demonstrated in bi2212",
    ", multilayer materials can accommodate heterovalent ions by making use of type ( b ) substitution whose effect on @xmath0  was seen to be weaker than type ( a ) substitution .",
    "furthermore , the space between the cuo@xmath1 planes forming a multilayer may buffer the impact of the disorder . for instance , in single - layer materials ,",
    "any displacement of the  upper \" apical oxygen in a cuo@xmath10 octahedron creates stress in the cuo@xmath1 plane because the motion of the octahedron is constrained by the  lower \" apical oxygen .",
    "double - layer materials contain cuo@xmath60 pyramids rather than cuo@xmath10 octahedra , and the separation between cuo@xmath1 planes relieves this stress , reducing the effects of type ( a ) disorder .",
    "this buffer zone between the outer cuo@xmath1 planes is further increased in triple - layer materials , with the additional benefit that the middle layer is somewhat  protected \" from the direct effects of pattern ( a ) ( and ( c ) ) disorder .",
    "cursory examination of fig .",
    "3 reveals that @xmath29  generally increases both across the rows and down the columns of the chart .",
    "indeed , there is no material in ( a-1 ) which possesses a @xmath29  higher than 50 k. furthermore , bi2201 in column ( a ) has a lower @xmath29  than tl2201 in column ( c ) , despite their similar crystal structures .",
    "similarly , @xmath29of tlba@xmath59la@xmath68cuo@xmath60 ( tl1201 ) is lower than that of hgba@xmath1cuo@xmath69 ( hg1201 ) .",
    "this trend is closely obeyed when one concentrates on the variation within a single family of materials , each denoted by a different color in the chart .",
    "for example , across the first row , oxygen - intercalated la@xmath1cuo@xmath69 located in ( c-1 ) has higher @xmath29  than sr - substituted la@xmath1cuo@xmath9 ( a-1 ) . down the column",
    ", @xmath29  of the bilayer la - based system la@xmath7sr@xmath8cacu@xmath1o@xmath10 ( a-2 ) is higher than that of its single - layer cousin .",
    "the classification suggests a negative correlation between the effective magnitude of chemical disorder and @xmath29 .",
    "additional remarks are made in ref.s .",
    "we note that one may also have to consider other factors which characterize the _ global _ materials properties and are likely to play a significant role as well in determining @xmath29 , such as madelung potential@xcite , bond valence sum@xcite , band structure @xcite , block layer @xcite , multi layer @xcite etc .",
    "although the present scheme is somewhat oversimplified and does not take account of these parameters , we believe it serves as a useful framework within which to consider the chemical disorder effects prevalent in these materials , at least some of which , if ignored , have the potential to lead to the misinterpretation of experimental data . finally , similar to previous work on tl1223 @xcite and to the present work on bi2212 , it might be possible to raise @xmath29  of certain other cuprates by minimizing the effects of chemical disorder .",
    "in summary , we present case studies of the effects of chemical disorder on the superconducting transition temperature of the single - layer and double - layer bi - based cuprate superconductors .",
