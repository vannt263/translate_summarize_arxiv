    "the propagation of cosmic rays ( crs ) through turbulent magnetic fields is effectively described as a diffusion process .",
    "this approach provides an excellent description of the observed spectra and chemical abundances of galactic crs up the cr knee at a few pev .",
    "the arrival direction of crs is mostly isotropized in this process and the location of the sources is hidden .",
    "the first order correction to the isotropic distribution is a small dipole anisotropy that scales with the local cr gradient according to fick s law .",
    "the phase and strength of this dipole is expected to be a combined effect of the relative motion of the solar system with respect to the frame where crs are isotropic  @xcite , the density gradient of crs , the strength of diffusion , and the strength and orientation of regular magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "various cr observatories have revealed anisotropies in the arrival directions of tev  pev galactic crs on large and small angular scales  @xcite . in this letter",
    "we will focus on small - scale anisotropies that have been studied via a power spectrum analysis by icecube  @xcite and hawc  @xcite ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) . @xcite",
    "have argued that small - scale anisotropies can naturally emerge as a next - to - leading order correction of the diffusive approximation if one takes into account the local scattering of crs within the diffusive scattering length .",
    "@xcite showed that under certain simplifying assumptions these small - scale fluctuations necessarily arise from the application of liouville s theorem . assuming a simple hierarchical evolution equation of the multipoles predicts a power spectrum that matches well the observations .",
    "fluctuations of the arrival direction of crs induced by local turbulent fields are not directly accessible in standard diffusion theory .",
    "this becomes obvious if one considers the angular power spectrum of the cr phase - space distribution ( psd ) @xmath0 defined as @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes a unit vector of @xmath3 and @xmath4 are legendre polynomials of degree @xmath5 . here and in the following we use the abbreviation @xmath6 for the local psd .",
    "in general , the small - scale magnetic field that determines the psd is unknown .",
    "therefore , the psd can only be predicted as an average over a statistical ensemble of random small - scale magnetic fields , usually characterized by its power spectrum . in ergodic systems , the average over turbulent magnetic field configurations , _",
    "i.e. _ ,  the _ ensemble _ average denoted in the following by @xmath7 , is equivalent to a time - average .",
    "however , the ensemble average of @xmath8 is proportional to @xmath9 , which is _ larger _ than the product of the ensemble averages , _",
    "i.e. _ ,  the standard solution of diffusion theory .",
    "on large timescales , the motion of crs in turbulent magnetic fields can be effectively approximated as a diffusion process .",
    "the angular - integrated psd @xmath10 then satisfies a diffusion equation , @xmath11 , where the diffusion tensor @xmath12 can be expressed as @xmath13 here , @xmath14 denotes a unit vector along the regular magnetic field . in general , the ( scattering ) rates @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are independent of one another .",
    "the presence of a small local gradient @xmath18 induces a dipole anisotropy in the quasi - stationary solution as a result of fick s law , @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , standard diffusion theory predicts that the dipole strength of the relative intensity @xmath20 is given as @xmath21 we will see in the following that this relation becomes modified once we consider corrections of the psd product in the ensemble average .",
    "this will also introduce multipoles at small angular scales , which can be related to properties of relative diffusion .",
    "we now study the effect of small local fluctuations of the psd around the ensemble average , @xmath22 . according to liouville s theorem",
    "we can relate the local ( _ i.e. _ ,  @xmath23 ) psd @xmath6 to the contribution backtracked along cr trajectories to an arbitrary time , @xmath24\\nabla n\\,,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote the local cr density and gradient and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the position and momentum of a cr ( that is at position @xmath29 and @xmath30 at time @xmath31 ) at backtracking time @xmath32 .",
    "now , in the limit of large @xmath32 the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : backtrack ] ) is dominated by the third term scaling with the position of the particle .",
    "also , for two momenta @xmath33 we can assume that the ensemble average of fluctuations are uncorrelated , @xmath34 , for sufficiently large backtracking times when the cr trajectories eventually separate .",
    "in the degenerate case @xmath35 the two backtracked cr trajectories stay correlated over arbitrarily long backtracking times .",
    "it will be sufficient to assume that @xmath36 remains finite .",
    "we can then express the multipole spectrum of the ensemble - averaged relative intensity as the limit @xmath37 @xmath38 being shorthand for @xmath39 .",
    "note that the @xmath40 multipole spectrum is generated through _ relative _ diffusion : it can be easily seen that the sum over _ all _ ensemble - averaged multipoles of the relative intensity can be expressed via the symmetric part of the diffusion tensor @xmath41 in the limit of large backtracking times @xmath32 , @xmath42 on the other hand , the average monopole contribution in this limit can be expressed as @xmath43 where the symmetric part of the relative diffusion tensor is defined as @xmath44 with @xmath45 . therefore , the sum of multipoles @xmath40 is related to the relative diffusion tensor . for uncorrelated particle trajectories , this expression reduces to the normal diffusion tensor .",
    "however , particle trajectories with a small relative opening angle will follow similar trajectories and the relative contribution ( [ eq : krel ] ) remains small over long timescales .",

    "we show results in terms of the dipole @xmath47 ( black ) , monopole @xmath48 ( blue ) , and medium-@xmath5 multipoles ( green ) .",
    "we also show the asymptotic noise level ( [ eq : noise ] ) ( red ) and the dipole prediction ( [ eq : standardc1 ] ) of standard diffusion ( magenta ) evaluated by the replacement @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cell ] ) . ]",
    "in the following , we will study the development of small - scale anisotropies via numerical simulations ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we follow the approach of @xcite and define a three - dimensional ( 3d ) turbulent magnetic field as the sum @xmath50 with @xmath51 random phases @xmath52 and wave vectors @xmath53 with 3d random orientations , on top of a regular field @xmath54 .",

    "we assume a kolmogorov - type phenomenology with @xmath62 and the strength of the turbulence relative to the regular magnetic field is fixed via a parameter @xmath63 and the normalization of the spatial average @xmath64 .    for the galactic environment",
    "we expect a regular magnetic fields of the order of @xmath65 g and a turbulent component with @xmath66 and a coherence scale @xmath67  pc .",
    "the larmor radius of 1 - 10  tev crs is then of the order of @xmath68 corresponding to a few hundred au .",
    "a numerical study of this configuration with the methods described above is very time - consuming since the asymptotic behavior relevant for the multipole configuration is reached at a very late stage . instead , here we will study a simple turbulent configuration that allows us to reach the necessary statistics to study the predicted effect qualitatively .",
    "we choose @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath71 with @xmath72 and fix the rigidity of the crs to @xmath73 .",
    "we sample over @xmath74 different turbulent magnetic field configurations . for each field configuration",

    "we also show the expected monopole component ( [ eq : c0 ] ) as blue lines . at large times , the high-@xmath5 components in the multipole expansion are dominated by noise , due to the finite number of trajectories .",

    "[ fig1 ] ) . given the finite number of trajectories , it might be difficult to disentangle noise variance and cosmic variance in the simulations ; we hence limit ourselves to the former only . similar to the simulation , the sensitivity of experimental data to high-@xmath5 multipoles is limited to shot noise indicated as dotted lines in the plot .",
    "overall , the simulation agrees well with the icecube and hawc data . for an isotropic gaussian field",
    ", deviations at multipoles of @xmath90 can be due to cosmic variance with @xmath91 .",
    "furthermore , the limited field of view of the observatories introduces additional systematic errors , in particular for low-@xmath5 multipoles , which are not included in the error bars of fig .",
    "in the following , we derive the asymptotic form of the power spectrum via a microscopic description of relative diffusion . as before , we split the psd into the average and fluctuating parts , @xmath92 .",
    "the ensemble - averaged boltzmann equation can be written as  @xcite @xmath93 here we have introduced the angular momentum operator @xmath94 and the rotation vectors @xmath95 and @xmath96 .    the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq : genboltzmann ] ) encodes the particle scattering in the random fields .",
    "the influence of the turbulence is typically approximated as a friction term introduced by @xcite ( bgk ) . in its original version",
    "this term drives the ensemble - averaged distribution @xmath97 to its isotropic mean @xmath25 with an effective relaxation rate @xmath98 , _",
    "i.e. _ ,  @xmath99 .",
    "the parameters @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are the effective parallel , perpendicular , and axial scattering rates , and can be related to the bgk rate @xmath98 via @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 . substituting into eq .",
    "( [ eq : k ] ) we find that the standard @xmath103 and @xmath104 ( [ eq : standardc1 ] ) scale as @xmath105 and @xmath106 , respectively , similar to the sum ( [ eq : id1 ] ) in the relative diffusion approach .",
    "we can generalize the bgk approximation of the friction term to higher multipoles if we consider the effect of turbulence on the particle momenta as a brownian motion on a sphere  @xcite . for a distribution @xmath107 on a sphere the brownian diffusion of momenta",
    "is described via @xmath108 . in particular ,",
    "if initially the configuration is localized , @xmath109 , then the solution at later times is given as @xmath110 .",
    "this reduces to a two - dimensional gaussian distribution of the opening angle @xmath111 defined via @xmath112 with a width @xmath113 .",
    "therefore , for the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq : genboltzmann ] ) we make the ansatz @xmath114 which is a natural generalization of the bgk approach . note that this simple treatment of the scattering term is only approximate .",
    "depending on the strength and coherence length of the turbulent magnetic field , the effective relaxation can in general be anisotropic even for a fully isotropic turbulence .",
    "however , in our case we are interested in the qualitative behavior and development of high-@xmath5 multipoles , and the first order bgk approximation seems appropriate .",
    "now , for the asymptotic solution of @xmath8 at large backtracking times we have to look for stationary solutions of the equation @xmath115 as before , we make the ansatz @xmath116 with the stationary solution @xmath117 . assuming that the spatial dependence of @xmath118 is small compared to @xmath119 we can replace the gradient term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : clevolution ] ) via @xmath120 . on the other hand , the second and third terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : clevolution ] ) are now non - trivial terms in the evolution that will lead to mixing and damping of multipoles .",

    "the relative and correlated scattering rates , @xmath124 and @xmath125 , respectively , depend on the relative distance of the trajectories at early times , which in turn depends on the trajectories opening angle . note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : bgk2 ] ) is necessarily symmetric under the interchange of @xmath126 as well as @xmath127 and is the most general linear approximation of all possible scalar combinations of @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "note that as in the original bgk ansatz , we do not account for the possibility of anisotropic scattering in turbulent fields .",
    "we now look for the power spectrum of a stationary solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : clevolution ] ) using the approximation ( [ eq : bgk2 ] ) .",
    "the product @xmath130 can be expanded into eigenstates of @xmath131 and @xmath132 and the power spectrum integral ( [ eq : celldef ] ) corresponds to projections onto the state @xmath133 with @xmath134 . the rotation term corresponding to the regular magnetic field in eq .",
    "( [ eq : clevolution ] ) does not contribute .",
    "since the relaxation rates @xmath135 and @xmath136 in the approximation ( [ eq : bgk2 ] ) are assumed to depend only on @xmath137 the relative rotation proportional to @xmath138 is the only non - vanishing term .    for identical momenta and rigidities , the relative diffusion should vanish completely .",
    "one way to see this is by considering a toy model where the initial configuration of crs is homogeneous  @xcite . from this setup",
    "one can infer that the psd at any time obeys @xmath139 .",
    "therefore , in this case we must also have @xmath140 .",
    "since this is independent of the initial configuration we must therefore conclude that @xmath141 .",
    "a functional dependence can be obtained from a geometrical argument : two particles emitted locally under a small opening angle will separate with a reduced relative velocity @xmath142 as long as both particles are experiencing a strongly correlated magnetic field .",
    "this leads to the ansatz @xmath143 with @xmath144 . to allow for a weaker or stronger @xmath145-dependence",
    ", we have generalized this form to @xmath143 , with @xmath146 .    under these assumptions and approximations ,",
    "the stationary average @xmath147 spectrum then obeys the set of equations ( see appendix  [ app1 ] ) @xmath148 with the effective dipole source term @xmath149 .",
    "since the rhs of the previous equation is an expansion in terms of legendre polynomials , we can easily derive the stationary spectrum as @xmath150 with the assumed @xmath143 , this simplifies to @xmath151 in the limit @xmath152 , @xmath153 , and so @xmath154 .",

    "while our ansatz @xmath143 is phenomenological in nature , a microscopic derivation of @xmath135 , in quasi - linear theory , will be presented in future work .",
    "we have discussed the appearance of small - scale anisotropy from the propagation of crs in local turbulent magnetic fields . we have shown that this effect can be understood as a phenomenon of relative diffusion , where crs with similar arrival directions experience correlated motion in the local magnetic environment .",
