    "( short exposures were taken in order to get proper motions of the brighter stars , using the first epoch in f336w . )",
    "all sets of images are well dithered , following the recipe by anderson & king ( 2000 ) .",
    "first- and second - epoch data of field far have already been fully described in b01 .",
    "the third epoch for this field ( go-8679 ) , consists of 98 @xmath36 1300s in f606w and 148 @xmath36 1300s in f814w .",
    "( we use the acs wide field images , which consist of 5 @xmath36 360s in f775w , only to produce the median super - sampled image in fig .  5 , below .",
    "we carried out the astrometry , for each filter and each epoch , with algorithms based on the effective - point - spread - function ( epsf ) fitting procedure described by anderson & king ( 2000 ) .",
    "the essence of the method is to determine a finely sampled psf of high accuracy , from images at several dither offsets .",
    "fitting of this psf to individual well - exposed star images gives a positional accuracy of @xmath38 pixel , without any systematic errors that depend on the location of the star with respect to pixel boundaries .",
    "unlike b01 , where we used global transformations between star positions in different epochs , here we make a local 6-parameter linear transformation for each star , using a surrounding net of several dozen well - measured stars ( isolated , low residuals , cluster members , high signal - to - noise , not saturated ) , to calculate the displacement of the star between the two epochs .",
    "the wfpc2 distortion has been corrected using the new improved solution by anderson & king ( 2003 ) ; even with this improved distortion correction , however , some distortion error remains . because its relative effect on two points increases with their separation , a global transformation has errors that a local transformation avoids .",
    "further details will be given in a paper on our methods ( anderson & king , in preparation ) .",
    "as a result of these changes in procedure , the proper motions used here have higher accuracy than those in b01 .",
    "their apparent dispersion has now decreased by about 10 % , indicating a clear decrease in measuring error .",
    "proper motions have been obtained combining the following pairs of data sets . in the fields center and",
    "near we used f336w 1995 and f814w 2000 shallow , for bright stars ( less than 2 magnitudes below the turn - off ) , and f814w 1995 and f814w 2000 deep , for faint stars ( more than 2 magnitudes below the turn - off ) ; in field far we used f814w 1995 and f814w 2001 , and also f555w 1995 and f606w 2001 , for faint stars .",
    "since the purpose of this paper is purely astrometric , we will present instrumental magnitudes only .    for convenience we will hereafter refer to f336w , f555w , and f814w as @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively , although it should be clearly understood that all photometry presented here is in the uncalibrated instrumental pass - bands .",
    "figure 2 shows the vector - point diagram of relative proper motions for all the independent measurements .",
    "the axes are parallel to right ascension and declination .",
    "since the cluster stars have been used as the reference list , the origin is at their centroid .",
    "the separation between cluster and field stars is clear .",
    "we arbitrarily considered to be cluster members all the stars with relative proper motion less than 5 mas yr@xmath21 . with this membership criterion ,",
    "cluster members have been plotted in fig .  2 as small points , and the field stars as heavier points .",
    "it is worth noting that the difference of motion of the cluster and the field stars reflects the low tangential motion of m4 around the galactic center ( which we shall show below is much lower than the circular velocity , so that m4 is close to its apogalacticon ) .",
    "for fields near and center , unlike field far ( studied in b01 ) , we have f336w images , which allow us to build two - color diagrams ( tcds ) .    in fig .",
    "3 we show the proper - motion separation for field near . the top panels show the 5-year displacements in the @xmath41 images , and in the bottom panels are the corresponding tcds in ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) for all the stars for which we have magnitudes in all three bands . the main limitation in the number of stars in fig .",
    "3 comes from the fact that faint main sequence stars are missed in @xmath39 .    in these diagrams the white dwarf sequence and main sequence of the cluster are clearly visible , plus the main sequence of the field .",
    "note that there are no field white dwarfs in the small wfpc2 field .",
    "an important result is the detection of an extragalactic point - source candidate , highlighted in the right panels of fig .   3 with an open circle , and labeled `` qso '' .",
    "this source falls in a position in the tcd beyond the locus defined by black bodies , incompatible with a star but compatible with an active galactic nucleus .    to show this , in fig .",
    "4 we present a simulated two - color diagram for qsos ( 3-pointed asterisks ) and a mixture of field stars ( small dots ) , kindly provided by grazian ( private communication ) , superposed on the m4 stars of fig .  4 ( open squares ) .",
    "the figure shows that our qso ( marked by vertical and horizontal lines ) falls in the region where qsos with @xmath44 are most concentrated .",
    "the code which created the simulated diagram is a modified version of hyperz ( bolzonella , miralles , & pell 2000 ) in  filters , using template stars from lejeune & schaerer ( 2001 ) and composite spectra of qsos from cristiani & vio ( 1990 )",
    ".    visual inspection of the presumed qso on an image reveals a faint surrounding blur that is not star - like .",
    "5 shows a part of a median image of 3 f775w acs / wfc images , super - sampled by a factor of 2 in each direction .",
    "( the acs images were chosen because of their better sampling .",
    "these images are raw , i.e. , without flat - fielding or removal of bias and cosmic rays , but they are adequate for the present purpose . ) in this figure , the stars labeled star13 are brighter than our extragalactic source candidate ( labeled qso ) , but they do not show any blur . though its extragalactic nature should be confirmed by spectroscopy , the color and the morphology of this source make the hypothesis that it is a background qso very likely .",
    "its extragalactic nature is further supported by the fact that the absolute proper motion of m4 that we will obtain in the following is consistent with the hipparcos - based value in the literature ( see below ) .",
    "the fact that this source is very close to point - like allows us to use our effective psf to measure its luminosity and position accurately .",
    "we can consider the extragalactic point source as an absolute reference point , from which we can infer absolute motions of objects in our fields .",
    "having derived this reference point , we can now use the stars from all three of our fields , as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "we find for the cluster @xmath45 the error in this proper motion comes almost completely from the error in measuring the positions of the qso .",
    "it is somewhat larger than the error in a well - exposed star position .",
    "since qsos behind other globular clusters will be useful too , it is of interest to ask what positional accuracy can be expected for them .",
    "we believe that the answer is that they should have the same accuracy as stars .",
    "the lower accuracy in the present case arises from an error in the first - epoch position that was 0.046 pixel , compared with 0.020 ( just like a well - exposed star ) in the second epoch .",
    "we believe that this error comes from the fact that the qso is about 1 magnitude fainter than what we would consider well - exposed and from the fact that a diffraction spike was only 4 pixels away at the first epoch ( 5 pixels at the second epoch ) .",
    "( this spike _ corresponds _ to the one visible in fig .",
    "5 to the left of the qso , but on account of a difference in telescope orientation it was considerably closer to the qso in the two - epoch wfpc2 images on which our measurements were necessarily made . )",
    "this proper motion was obtained only from the data sets f814w 1995 and f814w 2000 deep .",
    "the other data - set pair available for this object ( f336w 1995 and f814w 2000 shallow ) was taken with different filters , and this fact might introduce systematic biases . moreover , the latter sets of images have significantly lower signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the error has been calculated as the sum , in quadrature , of the errors in each epoch , and also an estimate of the error in the transformation , based on the number of stars used in the local transformation and on the rms of the displacement of these ( anderson & king , in preparation ) .",
    "our proper motion is in agreement with that of dinescu et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , @xmath46 , @xmath47",
    "@xmath3 @xmath48 , in which they use hipparcos - measured stars to link relative motions to an absolute system ; our difference is @xmath49 in the ra direction and @xmath50 in the declination direction .",
    "as we have said , this agreement with the solidly based hipparcos system strengthens our identification of our reference object as extragalactic . in galactic",
    "coordinates our proper motion becomes : @xmath51 in fig .",
    "6 we show the vector - point diagram of the proper motions in galactic coordinates , after placing the origin at the extragalactic source .",
    "the mean displacement of the cluster stars with respect to the extragalactic source is the combined effect of the motions of the sun and the cluster around the galaxy .",
    "we use the computational matrix in johnson & soderblom ( 1987 ) to derive the cluster space velocity with respect to the sun , @xmath52 .",
    "[ note that @xmath53 is a right - handed coordinate system , so components are positive in the direction of the galactic center , galactic rotation , and the north galactic pole , respectively . ]    assuming the following : 1 ) mean coordinates @xmath54 = ( @xmath55 ) , for the m4 fields ; 2 ) j2000 galactic coordinate system defined as before ; 3 ) a distance of m4 from the sun of 1.8 kpc ( a mean of various values in the literature ) , with an uncertainty of 10% ; 4 ) a radial velocity of 70.5 @xmath6 0.3 km s@xmath21 ( from the harris [ 1996 ] on - line catalog , june 1999 update ) ; 5 ) a right - ascension proper motion @xmath56 mas yr@xmath21 , and a declination proper motion of @xmath57 mas yr@xmath21 for m4 , we get : @xmath58 ) km s@xmath21 .",
    "then , assuming a galactocentric distance for the sun of 8.0 kpc and adopting a solar motion of @xmath59 km s@xmath21 ( binney & merrifield 1998 , p.  628 ) , we get for m4 @xmath60 which is the cluster space velocity relative to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) .",
    "if we assume a lsr circular motion of @xmath61 220 km s@xmath21 at our distance of 8.0 kpc , the cylindrical velocity components of m4 in a galactic rest frame are @xmath62 which corresponds to a galactic - rest - frame speed of 56 @xmath6 20 km s@xmath21 .",
    "we note how a small variation in the assumed parameters  in particular in the distance ",
    "well within the uncertainties , can turn the orbit from prograde into retrograde .",
    "( if we were to assume a distance of 2.2 kpc for m4as in the on - line catalog of harris  we would get @xmath63 km s@xmath21 . )",
    "our measure of the absolute proper motion of m4 is not affected by its annual parallax ( which is @xmath64 mas ) , given that the observations used in the present work were all taken at the same time of year .",
    "m4 is a globular cluster projected near the edge of the galactic bulge ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) , at a distance of about 2 kpc from the sun .",
    "we expect a modest number of foreground disk stars in our fields ( from here on we use `` foreground '' to mean in front of the bulge rather than in front of the cluster ) , but in the background we look through the outer edge of the bulge , and the inner part of the halo , at a height of @xmath67 kpc above the plane .",
    "although at such heights the density of the bulge and halo are both rather low , the volume we are probing is sizable , so that we see a large number of these stars .",
    "their absolute proper motion is just the reflection of the sun s angular velocity with respect to that point ; from that we can derive the value of the angular velocity of the lsr with respect to the galactic center , which is the fundamental galactic - rotation constant @xmath68 ( cf .",
    "kerr & lynden - bell 1986 , olling & merrifield 1998 ) . in this respect",
    "we do not need to involve ourselves with the complicated question of whether the distant field stars ( after elimination of foreground stars ) belong to the bulge , the halo , or some transition population ; the geometry along our line of sight is the same in any case , with the average velocity of these stars having no component toward or away from the galactic center .    to derive the value of @xmath5",
    "we need three steps :  ( 1 ) find the mean distance of the stars whose motion we are observing , ( 2 ) correct the observed proper motion for the velocity of the sun with respect to the lsr , and ( 3 ) relate the corrected proper motion to the angular velocity of the lsr with respect to the galactic center .    for the distance of the stars that we are observing ,",
    "we adopt the following working hypotheses :    1 .   the field stars are mainly bulge / halo members .",
    "( we will show below , on the basis of the observed distribution of the proper motions and colors , that the foreground stars have a negligible influence . )",
    "the stars whose motion we are studying are part of a spherical spatial distribution around the galactic center .",
    "we use this hypothesis just for simplicity in the estimation of the distance of its centroid ; a modest flattening ( like that of the bulge ) makes very little difference in this .",
    "our observations go deep enough that we do not lose stars on the far side of our sample , so that on the average they are indeed at the tangent point .",
    "( in asserting this we neglect the small effect of the @xmath69 flare - out of our cone of observation , which puts the average distance a little beyond the tangent point . in the non - rotating halo this has no effect , and in the modestly rotating bulge the stars in front of the tangent point and those behind it , closely equal in number , have oppositely directed transverse motions , which cancel each other in the mean . )    from these it follows that we can express the distance of the centroid , in our line of sight , of the bulge / halo stars ( which , for brevity , we will refer to simply as the bulge ) as a geometrical constant times the distance of the sun from the galactic center .",
    "this distance is @xmath70",
    "if we take @xmath71 kpc , then @xmath72 kpc .",
    "next , the difference between the proper motion of the bulge stars and that of the extragalactic point source is the absolute proper motion of that point in the bulge . to measure that motion",
    ", however , we must remove the foreground stars from our sample of field stars . to do this",
    "we draw a putative halo main sequence by shifting that of m4 down by 3.1 magnitudes , to allow for the difference in distance .",
    "then we draw a line 0.5 magnitude redder in color , to allow for the presence of stars of higher metallicity and for a small amount of observational error .",
    "we exclude the 411 stars to the right of this line .    fig .",
    "6 shows the proper motions of m4 and of the surviving 1086 field stars , in galactic coordinates .",
    "the origin has been set at the extragalactic point source , labeled qso .",
    "the error bars show the uncertainties in the motions with respect to the mean motion of the cluster stars . we have drawn a heavy circle at a radius of 4 times the semi - interquartile distance of the field stars from their median position .",
    "we considered stars inside it to be reliable members of the population whose motion we are studying , so we calculated the mean motion from them .",
    "this is the mean absolute proper motion of the bulge , and is shown as an arrow in fig .",
    "its error  calculated as @xmath73is indicated on the head of the arrow with a tiny error bar .",
    "( the larger error bar at the foot of the arrow shows the measurement error in the position of the qso . )",
    "the results are :   @xmath74 mas yr@xmath21 , @xmath75 mas yr@xmath21 .",
    "inclusion of the error in the qso position increases the sigmas to @xmath76 mas yr@xmath21 , however .",
    "we also carried out the same procedure with the entire set of field stars .",
    "the resulting mean motion differed by a little less than 5% from what we got from the purified sample , showing that the foreground stars did indeed need to be removed but that our results are not sensitive to exactly how we did the rejection .",
    "the apparent motion of the field stars is the reflection of the sun s motion with respect to that point .",
    "what we need instead , however , is the velocity of the lsr with respect to our region of observation ; this requires a correction for the solar motion with respect to the lsr .    both for this step and for the final step of converting the proper motion in this field into the apparent motion that we would observe at the galactic center",
    ", we need to rotate the components of a vector @xmath53 , in the local galactic system , into an orientation that accords with the direction of m4 from us , so that @xmath77 is in the radial - velocity direction , @xmath78 in the @xmath79 direction , and @xmath80 in the @xmath81 direction . that rotation is easily accomplished in two steps .",
    "first , rotate around the north celestial pole so that the new @xmath82 axis points toward longitude @xmath79 rather than the galactic center : @xmath83 then rotate around the @xmath84 axis by an angle @xmath81 , in the direction from @xmath82 toward @xmath85 : @xmath86 the combination of the two is @xmath87 the effect of the sun s motion with respect to the lsr , for which we assume @xmath88 km s@xmath21(binney & merrifield 1998 , p.   628 ) , then becomes @xmath89 km s@xmath21 , @xmath90 km s@xmath21 .",
    "the corresponding corrections to our observed proper motion of the bulge are these linear velocities divided by @xmath91 ( where 4.74 is the equivalent in km s@xmath21 of one astronomical unit per tropical year , and expressing @xmath92 in kpc will give a result in mas yr@xmath21 ) .",
    "thus @xmath93 mas yr@xmath21 , @xmath94 mas yr@xmath21 .",
    "since it is the reflection of this that shows up at the bulge , we must subtract these quantities from the observed proper motion of the bulge .",
    "the resulting angular proper motion of our bulge field with respect to the lsr is thus @xmath95 mas yr@xmath21 , @xmath96 mas yr@xmath21 .",
    "( note that because the correction for solar motion is a small one , [ 1 ] our choice of a value for @xmath97 was not critical and [ 2 ] we need not increase our quoted errors on account of any uncertainty in the solar motion . )    for the final step of moving from the apparent proper motion of bulge stars at the position of m4 to the angular velocity of the lsr around the galactic center , we note that if we assume circular motion for the lsr , then its velocity @xmath98 is perpendicular to a line from the sun to the galactic center , so that @xmath99 .",
    "( 2 ) then give @xmath100 on the other hand , the relation between transverse velocities and proper motions gives , with substitution from eq .",
    "( 1 ) , @xmath101 combining these two pairs of equations then gives @xmath102 these are two equations for @xmath5 , which give independent estimates of its value : @xmath103 if we were to take a weighted mean ( or what is equivalent , find @xmath5 by least squares from the two equations ) , the second equation would make only a very small contribution . since the referee has pointed out to us , besides , that @xmath104 would need to be corrected for a systematic contribution from bulge rotation seen at an oblique angle  a very uncertain quantity  we choose to solve for @xmath5 from the @xmath105 equation alone .",
    "the result is @xmath106 km s@xmath21 kpc@xmath21 .",
    "this is an independent measurement of this quantity , of which there are various other values in the literature .",
    "it is related in complicated ways to the other constants of galactic rotation , and a full discussion of that problem would be far beyond the scope of this paper . suffice it to say that our value is close to the @xmath107 km s@xmath21 kpc@xmath21 that is quoted in the comprehensive review by kerr & lynden - bell ( 1986 ) .",
    "although we have argued that our results do not depend on whether our field stars are members of the galactic bulge or halo population , we conclude this section by presenting some evidence that relates to this question , in the form of the sizes of the velocity dispersions .",
    "we took each of these to be half of the interval , centered on the mean , that includes 68.3% of the sample .",
    "the results are @xmath108 corresponding to 108 and 95 km s@xmath21 , respectively , under the assumption of @xmath109 kpc ( corresponding to @xmath110 kpc , according to eq .",
    "[ eq : mu1 ] ) . for what it is worth ,",
    "these values correspond to those found by spaenhauer , jones , & whitford ( 1992 ) , and by kuijken & rich ( 2002 ) , for bulge fields closer to the galactic center .",
    "the higher dispersion along galactic parallels than along galactic meridians is suggestive of galactic rotation , which should be seen in the bulge but not in the halo .",
    "in this work we have presented an astrometric study of the closest galactic globular cluster m4 , based on multi - epoch  observations .",
    "we have been able to separate almost perfectly the member stars from the field objects , and to identify an extragalactic point - source candidate ( qso ) .",
    "the qso allowed us to measure the absolute proper motion of m4 , for which we find @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath111 .",
    "moreover , we have been able to measure the apparent proper motion of the bulge and from it to derive an estimate of the value of @xmath112 km s@xmath21 kpc@xmath21 .    in a future paper",
    "we will use these proper motions to study the cluster members in more detail , studying the color  magnitude diagram , two - color diagram , luminosity function , mass function , and mass segregation .",
    "we are also working on the full data base , including the new acs / wfc images , to derive internal proper motions .",
    "it should soon be possible to derive a precise geometrical distance ( with an accuracy of a few per cent ) based on the comparison of the proper - motion dispersion with that of the radial velocities for a large sample of stars , using newly available multi - fiber high - resolution spectroscopic facilities like flames@xmath37giraffe at @xmath113 , a project we have already submitted to eso .",
