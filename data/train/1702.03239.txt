    "in order to understand the nuclear properties in the quasicontinuum , statistical quantities are used , such as the nuclear level density and the @xmath0-ray strength function ( @xmath0sf ) @xcite for a particular multipolarity .",
    "the strength function is the average reduced radiation or absorption probability of photons of given energy @xmath5 .",
    "it is commonly adopted that the e1 strength function is dominated by the giant electric dipole resonance ( gdr ) around @xmath6 mev , which can be reproduced , not too far from the maximum , by a classical lorentz line @xcite .",
    "it was earlier assumed that the e1 strength function for lower energy @xmath0-rays corresponds to the tail of this lorentzian .",
    "current experimental data @xcite show that the lorentzian description fails for these energies . in order to account for the lower @xmath0 energies ,",
    "the kadmenski- markushev - furman ( kmf ) model @xcite was suggested .",
    "empirical modifications of this model @xcite have also been used to describe the behavior of the e1 strength function at low @xmath5 with the use of the temperature - dependent gdr width .",
    "experimentally , resonances in the low @xmath5 region have long been observed , commonly termed as pygmy dipole resonances and attributed to the enhancement of the e1 strength function @xcite , partly due to the presence of a neutron skin .",
    "recent studies in rare earth nuclei have shown @xcite that bumps in the @xmath7 3 mev region are of m1 character .",
    "actually , the m1 transitions seem to play an active role in the @xmath0sf being described also by a lorentz line @xcite based on the existence of a resonance that originates from spin - flip excitations in the nucleus @xcite .    in the last decade things",
    "have become more complicated , since measurements of the @xmath0sf @xcite have revealed a newly observed minimum around @xmath8 mev , so besides the high @xmath5 enhancement , there is also a low @xmath5 enhancement .",
    "the first attempts to understand the low-@xmath5 enhancement @xcite used the kmf model to describe the gdr ; the contribution of the giant magnetic dipole resonance to the total @xmath0sf is fitted by a lorentzian , similarly to the e2 resonance , while the low-@xmath5 region is described by a separate term that has a power - law parametrization . in @xcite",
    "the authors used a functional form of the @xmath0sf with contributions from e1 and m1 resonances plus an exponential low - energy enhancement function to simulate two - step @xmath0-cascade spectra .",
    "they found that all m1 strength functions show a low-@xmath5 increase compared to the uncertain behavior of the low - energy e1 strength functions .    in @xcite",
    "it was found that the e2 transitions are of minor importance whereas the dipole transitions dominate in the low-@xmath5 enhancement region .",
    "the first theoretical evidence of the strong enhancement at low @xmath5 came from the shell model calculations of @xmath9(m1 ) values for @xmath10zr , @xmath11mo @xcite and @xmath12fe @xcite where the calculated @xmath9(m1 ) and the @xmath0sf showed large values for low @xmath5 .",
    "the influence of this low energy enhancement of the @xmath0sf is not of minor importance , as it has been found that the neutron capture reaction rates can grow due to this effect by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude @xcite .    in this study , we calculate @xmath9(m1 ) for @xmath13cr , @xmath14cr , and @xmath2v in the model space of @xmath3 using the oxbash shell model code @xcite . although the model space is small , the results lead to new insights . in addition , we are able to consider the m1 strength for transitions to excited states ( @xmath0 absorption ) . from this",
    "we show for the first time that the low - energy part of the m1 distribution is peaked at zero energy , and falls off exponentially below and above that point . for these nuclei",
    "we consider the states with @xmath15 obtained with the f742 hamiltonian from @xcite that reproduces the known low - lying energies in the nuclei of interest .",
    "the results are largely independent of the nucleus , the range of initial spins and the excitation energy .",
    "we show that the slope of the exponential fall off is determined mainly from the @xmath4 ( pairing ) part of the hamiltonian .    in the discussion",
    "we compare the m1 strength results for the @xmath3 model space with those obtained from the full @xmath16 model space for @xmath2v , again for states with @xmath15 . by allowing the successive occupance of all the orbitals of the @xmath16 shell , starting with the @xmath3 orbital alone ,",
    "we explore how the addition of orbitals affects the low - energy enhancement and the overall m1 strength disrtibution .",
    "we also compare our results to the available experimental m1 strength function of @xmath14v .",

    "the average m1 strength distribution @xmath18(m1 ) is shown in fig .",

    "the calculated @xmath9(m1 ) values are sorted according to increasing transition energy , @xmath5 , and grouped in energy bins of 0.2 mev width . for each bin",
    "the average @xmath9(m1 ) value , @xmath34 , was found by dividing the sum of the @xmath9(m1 ) values in this bin by their number .",

    "a similar exponential behavior is seen in all regions of excitation energy , even for the lowest region of 0 to 2 mev , where only @xmath0 absorption can take place .",
    "this result is very different from the brink - axel model where the strength function on excited states is related to the absorption strength function in the ground state .",
    "in contrast , the low - energy distribution is a generic feature for excited states , that can not be obtained from information on the ground state since it peaks at zero energy .",
    "comparative @xmath9(m1 ) diagrams for all three nuclei at @xmath21 = 6 - 8 mev can be seen in fig .",
    "they all have essentially the same functional form .",
    "the results for @xmath14cr divided into different ranges for the initial spin are shown in fig .",
    "the exponential shape is independent of spin .    in our orbital space ,",
    "the two - body interaction hamiltonian has only eight non - zero matrix elements , four for the isospin @xmath37 pairs and four for @xmath4 . by following the procedure of @xcite",
    ", we divide the hamiltonian into two parts and , keeping the symmetry , let them vary through the numerical coefficients , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath40 where the part @xmath41 contains the single - particle energies , @xmath42 includes the matrix elements with @xmath37 while @xmath43 includes the matrix elements with @xmath4 .",
    "the absence of the @xmath4 matrix elements , ( mainly pairing , @xmath440@xmath451 and @xmath442@xmath451 ) , makes the spectrum collapse to low energies .",
    "we find that the shape of the m1 distribution depends very little on the @xmath37 interaction , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , but there is a strong dependence on the strength of the @xmath4 interaction .",
    "for the case of the nuclei studied , it is found that the slope , @xmath46 , of the exponential functions fitted on the @xmath34 , is almost constant for all nuclei , while the height seems to vary more , depending on the nucleus . a closer look in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows that the selected @xmath23 value of the preexponent for @xmath13cr slightly overestimates the @xmath34 function ; however , the choice of a common @xmath23 value for these nuclei gives a good description of the @xmath34 .",
    "the approximation of the m1 strength by an exponential function has already been proposed in @xcite . there",
    ", the @xmath34 was calculated using the shell model for @xmath47mo and @xmath10zr , in a model space which permits both positive and negative parity states .",
    "the slope of the exponential for the positive parity states ranges from @xmath46=(0.33 - 0.41 ) mev , the lowest value corresponding to @xmath10zr .",
    "the slope of the negative parity states ranges from @xmath46=(0.50 - 0.58 ) mev for the mo isotopes , while @xmath46=0.29 mev for @xmath10zr @xcite .",
    "the slope for both parities is much more steep than the one found in this study .",
    "the difference in the exponential slopes in the two studies can be attributed to the different orbitals used for the studied nuclei . in our calculations we know that it is only the @xmath3 orbital that contributes to the low@xmath48energy enhancement , but we do nt know which are the important orbitals for @xcite . from the text it seems that these are the @xmath49 and @xmath50 , but no further conclusions can be drawn .",
    "however , we can say that the use of different orbitals will give rise to different slopes .",
    "another thing that could be affecting the slope of the low - energy enhancement , is the masses of the studied nuclei . as has already been shown , the pairing interaction is the main factor that affects the m1 distribution .",
    "the pairing changes the slope of the @xmath34 , in a way that , less pairing , gives a steeper slope .",
    "pairing depends on @xmath51 by a factor of @xmath52 @xcite , so in the @xmath51=90 - 96 region , pairing is 25@xmath53 smaller than the @xmath51=48 - 50 , thus the slope of the m1 distribution will be steeper .    in order to explore the point that the consideration of different orbitals will give rise to different slopes , we present in figs .",
