    "in the framework of the unification scheme @xcite of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , blazars are the radio  loud agns with jets oriented close to the line of sight of the observer .",
    "their emission encompasses the whole electromagnetic spectrum , from radio band to gamma - ray energies . a small fraction ( @xmath150 objects )",
    "have been detected at tev energies with cherenkov detectors ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "+ the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blazars shows two humps , whose origin is believed to be the boosted non - thermal emission from the relativistic jet , overwhelming the thermal components . in general , the synchrotron emission from energetic electrons in a tangled magnetic field accounts for the low energy bump of the sed .",
    "the emission mechanisms responsible for the high - energy bump , peaking in gamma - rays are still matter of debate . both hadronic and leptonic",
    "models can explain the observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the high - energy emission is explained in leptonic models as due to the inverse  compton ( ic ) scattering of relativistic electrons of the jet with a seed photon field for both bl lac objects and for flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) .",
    "photon field for the inverse - compton scattering can originate from the synchrotron emission itself ( synchrotron self compton , ssc , @xcite ) .",
    "the sed of bl lac objects is usually explained with sc and ssc emissions .",
    "+ the high energy bump of fsrqs is usually modeled in the external compton ( ec ) scenario , with photon fields for the ic originating from a source external to the jet .",
    "there are several sources of external photon fields that can play a role : the direct thermal radiation from the disk , the reprocessed disk emission from the broad line region ( blr ) or from the molecular torus @xcite , the thermal radiation from an hot corona @xcite .",
    "it is generally assumed ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) that the intensity of each external photon field depends on the distance of the emitting region from the super massive black hole ( smbh ) and on the accretion disk luminosity .",
    "particularly important , these external radiation fields can also absorb the gamma - ray photons , through the pair creation reaction @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , the intense emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) from the blr can partially absorb gamma rays at least for fsrqs with the most luminous accretion disk ( l@xmath3 @xmath1 10@xmath4 - 10@xmath5 erg s@xmath6 ) . above 20 gev/(1+z ) a spherical shell blr is virtually opaque to gamma rays emitted in the center , mainly due to luminous h ly@xmath7 and continuum emission of the blr .",
    "@xcite computed the blr optical depth ( @xmath8 ) as a function of the location of the gamma - ray dissipation region , assuming a blr luminosity of @xmath9=2.3@xmath10 erg / s , and a spherical shell geometry for the blr with internal radius @xmath11 , and external radius @xmath12 .",
    "they evaluated @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) at 35 gev , and @xmath13.3 ( @xmath15 ) at 50 gev for gamma - ray photons emitted at the mid point @xmath16 between internal and external radius ( at the internal radius ) of a blr with luminosity @xmath17 erg / s .",
    "@xcite also evaluated the optical opacity for the case of 3c 279 with a fainter blr ( @xmath18 erg / s ) .",
    "they obtained @xmath8 @xmath11 ( 7 ) at 35 gev , and 0.6 ( 5 ) at 50 gev for a gamma - ray emitting region at @xmath16 ( at @xmath11 ) of the blr shell .",
    "+ in the standard view , high energy emission from fsrq has been located inside the blr , whose intense emission provides the ideal environment for a powerful ic emission . @xcite and @xcite found marginal evidence that the gamma - emitting region is located within the blr during at least two flares of 3c 454.3 .",
    "however , there is growing evidence that , at least in some occasions or in some sources , the emission can occur much farther ( up to few pc ) from the central smbh .",
    "the sed modeling of fsrqs flares bounds the dissipation region at the edge , or outside the blr in a few cases : for pks 1222 + 216 ( dissipation region @xmath19 0.1 pc , @xcite ) , 3c 279 ( dissipation region at 0.070.26 pc , @xcite ) , pmn j2345 - 1555 ( 0.1 pc , @xcite ) , pks 1510 - 089 ( 0.07  3.2 pc , @xcite ) , gb6 j1239 + 0443 ( 0.2  7 pc , @xcite ) , pks b1424 - 418 ( 7 pc , @xcite ) .",
    "+ the study of the time - dependent polarimetric radio images at 43 and 86 ghz , the optical polarimetry , and the light curves from radio to gamma - rays for the fsrq 3c 454.3 @xcite , and for the bl lac objects oj287 and ao 0235 + 164 @xcite suggest that the low and high energy emission is located close to the 43 ghz core , at a distance of the order of tens of parsec from the smbh .",
    "this localization of the blazar zone for 3c 454.3 is in contrast with the results of @xcite .",
    "the gamma - ray emitting region for this fsrq is up for debate .",
    "+ while the evidence for emission events at large distances seems to imply large sizes for the active regions , there are clear indications that , at least in some occasions , the radiating region is very compact .",
    "fast variability with timescale of the order of several minutes has been detected at tev energies for several bl lac objects ( bl lac , mrk 501 , mrk 421 , pks 2155 - 304 ) , and for the fsrq pks 1222 + 216 . for the bl lac objects ,",
    "the observed variability time is too short when compared to the light crossing time of the horizon of the events @xcite , and for pks 1222 + 216 , the variability timescale is much shorter than that expected from a jet active region radiating at @xmath19 0.1 pc from the smbh .",
    "+ to overcome this problem , several mechanisms are proposed to produce fast flares : @xcite argues that radiative cooling of the shocked outflow layer can focus and lead to reconfinement of the ejecta . @xcite and",
    "@xcite proposed that rapid flares could be produced by turbulent cells in the relativistic plasma .",
    "alternatively , the fragmentation of the reconnection layer in magnetic reconnection events can produce a large number of plasmoids @xcite .",
    "the observable features of such events are the overlapped emission of these plasmoids with timescale of the order of a day ( or longer ) , and the occasional growth of exceptional plasmoids generating the observed fast flares .",
    "+ it is clear that the observations of emission states in which the spectrum extends beyond the energies expected from the absorption is particular relevant to investigate flares occurring far from the smbh , and to study their nature . with these motivations",
    "we have started a dedicated program , selecting flares from fsrqs with relevant emission above 10 gev in the archival , and in incoming  data of _ fermi  lat _ @xcite .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]      an obvious problem of the cooling scenario ( and , more generally , of the observed variability , see below ) is that , assuming a single , homogeneous emission region , the observed variability timescales would be dictated by the much longer light - cross time @xmath20 , which in the most extreme cases is of the order of 130 days . while ( by construction ) this timescale is in agreement with the duration of the observed active phases ( see figure [ fig_lcall1 ] , [ fig_lcall2 ] , [ fig_lcall3 ] ) , it is too long to explain the faster spikes in the gamma - ray light curve and the observed spectral variability .",
    "a possibility to solve this problem is to abandon the one - zone framework and to assume , besides the large region , accounting for the long duration flare , other , much smaller sub - regions responsible for the fast variability .",
    "different realizations of this idea are implemented in the reconnection model @xcite and in the turbulence scenario @xcite .",
    "+ in the magnetic reconnection framework , as presented in @xcite for the case of a blob size larger than the typical reconnection site , one can envisage the following scenario .",
    "reconnection sites occurring in the whole large emitting volume provide an almost stationary source of high - energy electrons ( randomly oriented envelope - plasmoids ) , whose integrated emission accounts for the long - lasting high - states ( this would correspond to the _ slow - envelope _ emission in @xcite )",
    ". the randomly oriented production of envelope - plasmoids troughtout the whole blob mimics the randomly oriented electron velocity distribution from the whole blob in leptonic models .",
    "occasionally , much more powerful events produce small ( compared to the whole blob ) plasmoids whose emitted luminosity is comparable or even larger than the envelope one , and oriented toward the observer ( _ monster - plasmoids _ ) .",
    "these events could explain the fast spikes in the light curve , and fast gamma - ray spectral variability that we showed for 4 sources .",
    "electron energy distribution is expected to be similar for envelope- and monster - plasmoids .",
    "+ we just depicted a multi - zone scenario which , instead , we modeled in the framework of single - zone homogeneous models , assuming large blob size ( @xmath21 )",
    ". we will show that the model we provided accounts for the envelope - emission ( assuming electrons accelerated throughout the whole blob ) , even if we showed fast - spikes during he activity periods : _",
    "i ) _ the envelope- and monster - plasmoid will dissipate at the same @xmath22 , thence the @xmath23 opacity and the klein - nishina arguments apply simultaneously for the two - components of the model , and the dissipation zone must be searched for at the outer edge of the blr or beyond ; _ ii ) _ in our seds we integrated gamma - ray data for long lasting periods including the envelope emission , and the fast spikes which are expected to have a similar intensity to the envelope emission , and similar electron energy distribution ; _ iii ) _ the x - ray , nir , and optical - uv data where never collected during he fast spikes .",
    "so , at most , we overestimated the gamma - ray spectra by a factor 2 for the envelope emission ( because envelope- and monster - plasmoid emission are expected to give similar intensities ) ; _ iv ) _ a correction in sed modeling to account for the fast - spikes will eventually cause the compton dominance to be lowered for the envelope - emission , and thence the @xmath24 to be raised of the same amount , and finally the product @xmath25 to be lowered by a factor @xmath12 in order to maintain the synchrotron and ssc emission at the observed value .",
    "the last requirement could be accomplished with modest changes of @xmath26 and/or @xmath27 ( and thence of @xmath22 ) .",
    "+ a similar idea could be sketched for the turbulence scenario @xcite .",
    "of course this scheme needs to be quantified and specified , a task clearly beyond the aims of the present study .",
    "our systematic study enlarges the sample of fsrqs showing evidence of gamma - ray flares occurring outside the blr .",
    "the lack of the expected absorption signatures due to the interaction with the blr radiation field constraints the dissipation region outside the cavity of the blr for all the sources , and outside the core of the blr spherical shell for the 5 most powerful broad line emitters in our sample .",
    "this consideration does not depends on the emitting mechanism of fsrqs .",
    "it is based on existing measurement of the broad line luminosities , and slightly depends on the blr geometry and emission model @xcite . + in the framework of leptonic models for blazar emission , we showed that ic on blr photon field is subject to klein - nishina suppression .",
    "the lack of this suppression , and of the @xmath28 absorption in our spectra could only be explained assuming a dissipation region at the outer edges of the blr or further out .",
    "+ furthermore , the leptonic sed modeling locates , in some cases , the radiating zone at parsec scale , assuming the existence of the molecular torus for all the sources @xcite .",
    "if this is not the case , the solution must be put just outside the broad line regions , because , in this hypothesis , the comoving intensity of the external radiation field drops rapidly with the distance of the moving source from the smbh .",
    "+ once the region within the blr cavity is excluded , the location of the blazar zone is a stable result of leptonic sed modeling for solutions found within the core of the blr ( between inner and outer shell radii of the blr ) because of the rapidly varying external radiation energy density @xmath29 from the inner to the outer radius of the blr .",
    "the characterization of the blazar - zone as located outside the blr is also a stable result of leptonic modeling , once the solution is found outside the external radius of the blr .",
    "but in this case , the refined localization depends on the chosen details in the modeling ( @xmath30 ratio , the electron density , and @xmath27 ) , because the external radiation field @xmath31 is constant up to @xmath32 .",
    "+ here we assumed the emitting ( envelope ) region to encompass the entire jet cross section , and a jet aperture angle @xmath33 .",
    "recent vlbi observations ( clausen - brown et al . 2013 , jorstad et al . 2005 , pushkarev et al . 2009 ) indicate slightly lower values , @xmath34 .",
    "however , even these lower aperture angles would imply in several cases jet cross section radius larger than @xmath35 cm ( see table [ tab_he_sed_model ] ) , i.e. minimum variability timescales of several days .    as already noted , for several sources such long minimum variability timescales",
    "are inconsistent with the much shorter variability timescale inferred from the gamma - ray light - curves .",
    "this problem can not be easily solved assuming that the region is located at smaller distance from the smbh , since the variability timescale of @xmath36 day can be reproduced only with radii of the order of @xmath37 cm , which implies distances in several cases smaller than the blr radius . the same problem , i.e. the inconsistency between the observed variability timescales and those expected from the estimate of the source dimension , has been encountered in several other blazars , both bl lacs and fsrqs ( e.g. the bl lac object mrk 421 , @xcite , or pks 2155 - 304 , @xcite ) .",
    "for fsrq the most extreme case is that of pks 1222 + 216 , which showed a doubling of the tev flux in about 10 minutes @xcite .",
    "+ we point out that the location of the blazar zone in this work has been achieved within the framework of leptonic models , and we did not try other modeling such as the spine - sheath or hadronic ones .",
    "+ we obtained periods of he activity lasting from 1 d to about a month .",
    "the he activity periods coincide with activity at lower energy . within this period of activity",
    "we have identified shorter periods with timescales of the order of 0.20.6 d characterized by brighter emission of he gamma - rays .",
    "focusing on these short periods , a rather obvious consequence of our searching criterion is the relevant flux we derive above 10 gev .",
    "we indeed evaluated that chance probability of our searching method is very low for at least 2 flares ( cta 102 and pks 0805 - 07 ) over 4 sources for which we can try this study .",
    "for the other two flares that we examined in details ( 3c 454.3 , and pks 1502 + 106 ) the gamma - ray spectrum from 200 mev to 10 gev ( i.e. , below the energy threshold of our searching method ) is rather hard .",
    "thence the hard gamma - ray spectra obtained below 10 gev are not biased results .",
    "they imply an energy spectral index @xmath38 1 , suggesting that the emission derives from a fresh ( i.e. not cooled ) population of electrons injected / accelerated in the source .",
    "the spectral fit to gamma - ray spectra of periods b for the flares of cta 102 and 3c 454.3 ( table [ tab_period_b_fit_complete ] ) , when compared to periods a , reveals a break , or a curvature , or a cutoff .",
    "the limited statistics does not allow us to discriminate among the different models .",
    "we note that the fit with a broken powerlaw gives @xmath39 @xmath1 0.75@xmath400.32 for 3c 454.3 , and 0.72@xmath400.35 for cta 102 .",
    "one valuable option is that we are observing the progressive cooling of the fresh high - energy electrons , leading to a break with @xmath41 .",
    "the relatively long cooling time implied by the data supports the view that the emission occurs through the ec scattering in an environment with a low energy density of the target photons , such as that of the dusty torus .",
    "the spectra for period a of the other sources show similar trend ( with the exception of pks 0805 - 07 ) .",
    "the gamma - ray spectra of periods c , d give a further hint of the ongoing cooling .",
    "we note , however , that period a for cta 102 corresponds to a fast flare in the whole _",
    "lat _ energy band",
    "( not only at he ) , as shown in figure [ fig_lcall3 ] .",
    "this consideration makes it hard to correlate periods a and b for this source in terms of slow  cooling , with period a encompassing the whole development of the gamma - ray flare . + it s worth mentioning the gamma - ray spectrum reported in @xcite for pks 1222 + 216 , obtained integrating fermi ",
    "lat gamma - ray data for 8 days around the fast tev flare studied in @xcite . with this integration time , in the slow cooling dominated scenario , the cooled electron population dominates the gamma - ray spectrum .",
    "@xcite reports @xmath42 and they invoke the slow  cooling scenario for the tev flare . + some of the gamma - ray spectra integrated on long periods for 4c + 38.41 and b2 1520 + 031 show peculiar structures , reminiscent of absorption features .",
    "we performed the time - resolved study of the gamma - ray spectra of 4c + 38.41 which showed the brighter he flare .",
    "the analysis revealed , instead , that there was at least one period in which the spectrum is flat ( period a ) , followed by periods in which the spectrum is soft ( period b ) . as above this behaviour could be interpreted as due to the injection and subsequent cooling of high - energy electrons in the emitting region .",
    "the integrated spectra show both mechanisms in action , resulting in absorption  like features .",
    "it is not always possible to time - resolve acceleration from cooling  dominated periods . in fact , we reported in table [ tab_he_sample ] that the he gamma - rays are emitted on long timescales , possibly causing the superpositions of accelerations and cooling phases .",
    "+ we did not attempt with this study to establish if he is a rare emission phase or not for fsrqs .",
    "from the sub - sample of 10 fsrqs reported here , we triggered @xmath130 he flares in total , ranging from 1 to 8 per source within 5.3 years of _ fermi  lat _ operations .",
    "we will address this study on the whole _",
    "lat _ sample in a forthcoming paper .",
    "+ summing up , our findings picture a scenario in which , during he flares , the emission from fsrq occurs in regions distant from the central bh .",
    "further , we find evidence for the likely presence of substructures , responsible for the observed relatively rapid variability ( flux and spectrum ) .",
    "this framework is similar to that inferred from the observations of other fsrq , especially during the emission of tev photons . among the possible theoretical scenarios advanced to explain such a phenomenology",
    ", we briefly discuss the reconnection model of @xcite and that invoking turbulence in the flow @xcite . in the relativistic magnetic reconnection scenario envisaged in giannios ( 2013 ) , long term high states",
    "are thought as the  envelope \" of events of dissipation of magnetic field in the jet through reconnection . during these events",
    "there is the possibility that  monster plasmoids \" form , which accounts for the fast flares .",
    "the discussion in @xcite was tailored to the case of the tev flare of pks 1222 + 220 , but the scenario should be applicable to the cases presented in our paper with small changes .",
    "turbulence in the flow has been invoked as a possible mechanism able to produce rapid flickering of the light - curve both for fsrq @xcite and bl lac objects @xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "small cells of fluids characterized by fast turbulent speed can produce the rapid flares , while the long - term emission is produced by the larger active region encompassing the whole jet . in the @xcite model ,",
    "the activity is triggered by the passage of the flow in a re - collimation shock , thought to form at parsec scale when the jet internal pressure drops below that of a confining medium .",
    "in this idea , the modulation of the injected power into the jet by the central engine accounts for the long - term evolution of the emission , while the emission from single turbulent cells produce the rapid flares .",
    "simulation along the lines of those reported in @xcite could test if the scenario can reproduce the phenomenology shown by lat .",
    "+ the evidence of an emitting region outside the blr led to the obvious conclusion of an interaction of the emitted gamma - ray with the external radiation field of the ir torus .",
    "the consequent absorption would lead to a cut - off in the gamma - ray spectrum in the vhe ( very high energy , @xmath43gev ) range @xcite , where the imaging cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) systems operate .",
    "the detection by iacts of the fsrqs of our sample would allow to verify this hypothesis .",
    "the objects of this study have high redshift and the absorption by the optical and ir extragalactic background light ( ebl ) has a non - negligible effect that must be taken into account .",
    "the unabsorbed fraction at 100 gev spans from a factor 0.75 for pks 2345 - 1555 at z=0.6 up to 0.1 at z=2 .",
    "ebl absorption is more severe at 300 gev , where most of the present generation of cherenkov telescopes ( magic , hess and veritas ) have their highest sensitivity . at 300 gev",
    "the unabsorbed fraction ranges from a factor 0.1 at z=0.6 up to @xmath44 at z=2 .",
    "therefore the possibility of detection in the vhe range relies on one side on instruments with the lowest energy threshold such as magic @xcite , and on the other side on the high sensitivity of the cherenkov telescopes of future generation , such as the cherenkov telescope array ( cta , @xcite ) .    assuming a sensitivity of @xmath45 erg/@xmath46/s at 100 gev for few hours of observations by present iacts @xcite and an unabsorbed fraction of @xmath47 , the extrapolation of the spectra shown in figure [ fig_period_a_b ] shows that some of the sources with the hardest and highest flux , e.g. cta  102 , 3c  454.3 , pmn  j2355 - 1555 , could be detected during a flaring episode , or could yield a sound upper limit constraining the cut - off . on the other hand the fast drop of the flux at higher energies would reduce the possibility to measure precisely the spectrum at few hundreds of gev , which is the necessary condition to disentangle the absorption of ebl from the internal absorption due to the ir radiation field . to perform this measurement",
    "the existing iacts should restrict to the nearest sources , while most distant ones will be the targets of the forthcoming cta , which promises a sensitivity up to an order of magnitude better than the present generation of cherenkov telescopes .",

    "<S> the gamma - ray emission offers a powerful diagnostic tool to probe jets and their surroundings in flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , sources emitting at high energies ( @xmath0 gev ) give us the strongest constraints . </S>",
    "<S> this motivates us to start a systematic study of flares with bright emission above 10 gev , examining archival data of _ fermi_-lat gamma - ray telescope . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> , we began to trigger target of opportunity observations to the _ swift _ observatory at the occurrence of high - energy flares , obtaining a wide coverage of the spectral energy distributions for several fsrqs during flares . among the others we investigate the sed of a peculiar flare of 3c 454.3 , showing a remarkable hard gamma - ray spectrum , quite different from the brightest flares of this source , and a bright flare of cta 102 . </S>",
    "<S> we modeled the sed in the framework of the one  zone leptonic model , using also archival optical spectroscopic data to derive the luminosity of the broad lines and thus estimate the disk luminosity , from which the structural parameters of the fsrq nucleus can be inferred . </S>",
    "<S> + the model allowed us to evaluate the magnetic field intensity in the blazar zone , and to locate the emitting region of gamma rays in the particular case in which gamma - ray spectra show neither absorption from the blr , nor the klein - nishina curvature expected in leptonic models assuming the blr as source of seed photons for the external compton . </S>",
    "<S> for fsrqs bright above 10 gev , we where able to identify short periods lasting less than 1 day characterized by high rate of high energy gamma rays , and hard gamma - ray spectra . </S>",
    "<S> + we discussed the observed spectra and variability timescales in terms of injection and cooling of energetic particles , arguing that these flares could be triggered by magnetic reconnections events or turbulence in the flow . </S>"
