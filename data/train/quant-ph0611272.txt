    "any measurement performed on a quantum systems alters the state of system itself .",
    "as a consequence , any scheme aimed to extract _ information _ about the state of a system unavoidably produces a _",
    "disturbance_. the same is true if we focus on a specific quantity rather than the state as a whole : any scheme devised for the _ estimation _ of an observable or generalized observable produces a _ distortion _ of the probability distribution of the measured quantity .",
    "the trade - off between the amounts of the extracted information about a quantum state and the corresponding added disturbance , from now on the _ information / disturbance _ trade - off , has received much attention @xcite . besides fundamental interest this is motivated by practical applications in quantum communication and quantum cryptography @xcite .",
    "the information / disturbance trade - off crucially depends on the set of input states and may be quantified in terms of fidelities . for finite - dimensional systems , inequalities on fidelities , which express the bounds on precision imposed by quantum mechanics , have been derived in several cases .",
    "these include a single copy of an unknown pure state @xcite , many copies of identically prepared pure qubits @xcite , a single copy of a pure state generated by independent phase - shifts @xcite , an unknown spin coherent state @xcite , and single copy of an unknown maximally entangled state @xcite .",
    "optimal measurement schemes , which saturate the bounds , have been also devised @xcite and implemented @xcite .    a relevant concept in quantum estimation is universality .",
    "a protocol is said to be universal if the fidelities are independent on the input state , at least within the class of states under investigation .",
    "in fact , for systems with infinite - dimensional hilbert space an information / disturbance trade - off has been derived for an unknown coherent state ( _ i.e. _ for a set of coherent states with flat distribution of the amplitude ) assuming universality and gaussian operations @xcite . an optimal measurement scheme saturating this bound has also been proposed and realized @xcite .",
    "in addition , it has been shown how to slightly improve the trade - off using non gaussian operations @xcite .",
    "the quantum mechanical back - action in the measurement of a specific observable has been extensively studied in the context of quantum nondemolition measurements ( qnd ) @xcite . in a qnd scheme , an observable",
    "is measured , without destroying the state carrying the information , with the aim of keeping the distortion ( back - action ) in the conjugated observable and thus preserving the value of the observable itself @xcite .",
    "the corresponding _ estimation / distortion _ trade - off has been mostly analyzed in terms of variances .    in this paper",
    "we report a detailed analysis of an optical scheme based on linear optical components and homodyne detection that can be used to achieve two different , though related , tasks . on the one hand it allows to implement non universal estimation protocol for gaussian sets of coherent states and to improve the trade - off , _",
    "i.e. _ the extraction of information with minimum disturbance , in comparison with universal protocols . on the other hand",
    ", it represents a nondemolitive measurement scheme of a generalized observable , the annihilation operator , suitable for a generic set of states , _ i.e. _ an indirect measurement of the @xmath0-function .",
    "we assess its qnd performances in terms of fidelities @xcite , which quantify how much the measured distribution resembles the @xmath0-function of the input states , and how much the distribution of the output states has been distorted by the measurement protocol . going beyond variances allows us to investigate non gaussian states .",
    "indeed , we analyze the _ estimation / distortion _ trade - off for gaussian sets of coherent states and thermal sets of fock number states .",
    "the scheme under investigation is that used in ref .",
    "@xcite to investigate the universal gaussian information / disturbance trade - off for an unknown coherent state .",
    "the same scheme has also been used to demonstrate @xmath1 optimal gaussian cloning of coherent states @xcite and suggested for more general cloning task , such as @xmath2 cloning of coherent states @xcite or cloning of general gaussian states @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section [ s : scheme ] we describe the measurement scheme as well its statistics and dynamics . in section",
    "[ s : est ] we introduce the inference rules and the fidelities , whereas in sections [ s : coh ] and [ s : fock ] we explicitly evaluate the trade - offs for gaussian sets of coherent states and thermal sets of fock number states , respectively . section [ s : outro ] closes the paper with some concluding remarks .",
    "the measurement scheme we are going to analyze is schematically depicted in fig .  [",
    "f : scheme ] , where we show the configuration used for state inference ( left ) as well as that used for nondemolitive measurement of the @xmath0-function ( right ) . in our scheme",
    ", the signal @xmath3 , _ i.e. _ mode @xmath4 , is mixed with the vacuum at a beam splitter with transmissivity @xmath5 .",
    "the reflected beam is then measured by a double homodyne detector with quantum efficiency @xmath6 .",
    "the outcomes of the measurement are complex numbers @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 being the outcomes from the two homodyne detectors , which are used either to infer the state at the input , or collected to build an estimate of the input @xmath0-function . in both cases , a suitable real rescaling factor @xmath10 may be used to optimize the fidelities .",
