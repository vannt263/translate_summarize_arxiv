    "large amplitude alfvn waves are ubiquitous in space and astrophysical environments . such waves are believed to play key roles in the so - called dsa ( diffusive shock acceleration ) process in which charged particles are diffusively accelerated in the course of multiple scattering through turbulent alfvn waves upstream and downstream of collisionless shocks .",
    "the dsa is widely accepted as one of the most efficient acceleration mechanisms of galactic cosmic rays of energy up to @xmath0 @xcite . in the process",
    "it is implicitly assumed that the alfvn turbulence is phase randomized and its spectrum is time stationary . on the other hand ,",
    "turbulent alfvn waves commonly observed in the solar - terrestrial environments are often intermittent , and coherent mhd structures are frequently superposed .",
    "namely , the phase random approximation can not be assumed @xcite and a spectrum of turbulence may evolve both in space and time @xcite .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that nonlinear wave - wave interactions tend to generate coherence among wave phases , and that spatial and temporal scales of relaxation processes in space plasmas are much larger than typical scales of our solar - terrestrial system .",
    "this may hold true with some high energy astrophysical environments .",
    "that is , spatial and temporal scales of a relaxation process are not negligibly small in comparison with scales of a whole acceleration site . generally speaking ,",
    "particle acceleration rate through coherent wave - particle interactions is much higher than that through incoherent , or fully turbulent , wave - particle interactions @xcite .",
    "therefore , acceleration processes through coherent wave - particle interactions in a developing turbulence , where a turbulence has not been fully developed , should be paid more serious attention .",
    "it is well - known that in various space plasma environments a nonequilibrium ion distribution function generates large amplitude alfvn waves through some instabilities and that those waves nonlinearly evolve to produce coherent magnetic wave forms .",
    "one of the common interpretations of generation mechanisms of such wave forms accompanying density fluctuations which are frequently observed in the solar wind @xcite is a parametric instability where nonlinear wave - wave interactions convert energy of a parent wave into several daughter waves with different frequencies and wavelengths @xcite .",
    "although in the context of cosmic ray acceleration in turbulent media the above process was taken into account to estimate steady state distributions of wave intensities @xcite , its developing processes and associated coherent wave - particle interactions have never been considered .",
    "recent numerical studies revealed that successive parametric instabilities result in turbulent wave forms which have not been fully developed @xcite .",
    "however , only a few past studies paid much attention to particle acceleration processes in such a developing turbulence .",
    "furthermore , only limited spatial and temporal evolutions of wave forms or spectra were discussed , since a computational resource was limited .    in this paper long time evolution of parametric instabilities of a large amplitude alfvn wave in a rather large spatial domain is reproduced by utilizing one - dimensional relativistic full particle - in - cell ( pic ) code .",
    "a plasma is assumed to be composed of electrons and positrons , since electron - positron pairs can be the dominant constituent of some high energy astrophysical plasmas like in the vicinity of a pulsar , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , gamma ray burst ( grb ) , and so on . in the simulation we observe a particle acceleration process which is quite efficient and is due to interactions between coherent alfvn waves and relativistic particles .",
    "the process is quite different from some other coherent acceleration processes being discussed recently , in which high frequency electrostatic waves play essential roles , like electron surfing acceleration induced by a cross field buneman instability @xcite and wakefield acceleration @xcite .    simulation settings and results are represented in section 2 .",
    "the acceleration process is discussed in detail by using an analytical model and test particle simulation in section 3 .",
    "summary and discussions are given in section 4 .",
    "long time evolution of parametric instabilities of a large amplitude monochromatic alfvn wave in a relativistic pair plasma is reproduced by performing a one - dimensional pic simulation .",
    "a parent wave is given only at the beginning of the run as a monochromatic and right - handed circularly polarized alfvn wave with amplitude @xmath1 and wavenumber @xmath2 ( number of wave mode is 512 ) which gives a frequency @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the ambient magnetic field which is along the @xmath5axis , @xmath6 denotes speed of light , and @xmath7 is nonrelativistic gyrofrequency , respectively .",
    "corresponding velocity perturbations of the pair plasma are given by the relativistic walen relation @xcite .",
    "boundary conditions are periodic for particles and all field components .",
    "system size is @xmath8 .",
    "squared ratio of nonrelativistic gyro and plasma frequencies is @xmath9 , and normalized scalar temperature for both electrons and positrons is @xmath10 .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] shows time evolutions of energy densities ( upper panel ) and fourier spectra of wave amplitudes for @xmath11 and @xmath12 field components ( lower panels ) . in the upper panel",
    "the solid lines denote electron and positron kinetic energies ( labeled by ` elec . ' and ` posi . ' ) , transverse magnetic field energy ( ` @xmath13 ' ) , and transverse and longitudinal electric field energies ( ` @xmath14 ' and ` @xmath12 ' ) , respectively .",
    "the dashed line indicates the total energy , which is well conserved during the run .",
    "although rather long system evolution ( up to @xmath15 ) is calculated , the system is still far from the so - called equilibrium state . in the lower panels wave amplitude spectra for positive and negative helicity ( corresponding to positive and negative wavenumbers respectively ) modes of the @xmath11 component",
    "are shown in the left ( @xmath16 ) and middle ( @xmath17 ) panels by using a technique of fourier decomposition @xcite .",
    "note that in the middle panel the actual sign of the wavenumber is negative . since most of the daughter waves are right - hand polarized , the left ( middle ) panel shows wave intensity mainly of positively ( negatively ) propagating waves . at the beginning",
    "only the parent wave has significant intensity at @xmath18 in the left panel , although it is not particularly outstanding in the figure because of the narrow spectrum . in the early stage ,",
    "@xmath19 , the parent wave energy is transfered to a variety of daughter waves through large number of channels of wave - wave interactions . in this stage",
    "two parametric instabilities are dominant .",
    "a modulational instability generates daughter magnetic fluctuations with the same signs of wavenumber as that of the parent wave .",
    "they are observed in the @xmath16 spectrum .",
    "couplings among the daughter and the parent waves result in compressional electrostatic fluctuations with wavenumber smaller than that of the parent wave as seen in the right panel . in a decay instability ,",
    "on the other hand , daughter magnetic fluctuations have negative wavenumbers which appear in the @xmath20 spectrum , while daughter electrostatic fluctuations have wavenumbers larger than that of the parent wave in the right panel .",
    "most of the parent wave energy is wasted in this stage .",
    "however , the intensities of the daughter waves are still large so that successive parametric instabilities occur thereafter .",
    "these successive processes are sustained mainly by decay instabilities which can be confirmed because peak wavenumbers of the @xmath12 spectrum is always larger than those of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 spectra .",
    "the previous simulation study by @xcite confirmed occurence of up to the second decay instability for the case of @xmath21 .",
    "fig.[fig2]a demonstrates electron energy distribution functions at various times .",
    "fourier amplitude spectra of @xmath11 component at the corresponding times are plotted in fig.[fig2]b .",
    "rapid heating occurs after the first instabilities developed ( @xmath22 : black dashed line ) . up to this stage ,",
    "most of the electrons show semi - stochastic motions in a noizy system with a primary wave . here",
    "we refer the primary wave and the noize to the parent wave and superposition of the daughter waves , respectively .",
    "this results in rapid scattering in pitch angle as shown in fig.[fig2]c , where an average pitch angle of electrons with respect to @xmath4 and its standard deviation are plotted as a function of time .",
    "the standard deviation just after its rapid growth at @xmath23 is @xmath24 , which roughly coincides with an analytical estimate of the maximum pitch angle width of an electron resonating with the monochromatic parent wave ( see appendix ) .",
    "after the parent wave disappears , most of the electrons are detrapped by the parent wave and start to wander in the phase space .",
    "as time passes , a high energy tail appears in the electron distribution function ( fig.[fig2]a ) , which gradually approaches a power - law spectrum with index @xmath25 ( @xmath26 : gray solid line , @xmath27 : black solid line ) . at the same time the wave amplitude spectrum develops the power - law type spectrum also , with the index @xmath28 , while the wave spectral peak shifts toward lower wavenumbers .",
    "a behaviour of the most efficiently accelerated electron is shown in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "fig.[fig3]a indicates energy time history of the electron .",
    "spatial trajectory of the electron during @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) is plotted in fig.[fig3]c(d ) .",
    "a background color scale denotes strength of magnetic fluctuations @xmath31 .",
    "horizontal arrows in fig.[fig3]c(d ) and fig.[fig3]a correspond to each other denoting time intervals where strong accelerations occur .",
    "fig.[fig3]e(f ) shows a snapshot of the wave profile at the time denoted as the dashed line in fig.[fig3]c(d ) .",
    "the red , blue , and black lines represent @xmath32 , @xmath11 , and an envelope , respectively .",
    "the dotted line indicates the position of the electron .",
    "it is seen that strong acceleration occurs when the electron is trapped in a trough of the magnetic envelope .",
    "such sharp envelope troughs are temporarily observed in various regions of the system throughout the run .",
    "hence , the electron experiences similar acceleration processes several times . in this example one may recognize four such acceleration periods . only the second and the third periods are marked ( the first ( fourth ) one is @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) ) .",
    "the acceleration occurs always perpendicular to @xmath4 as seen in fig.[fig3]b which shows a trajectory of the electron in the @xmath35 space , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 denote the four - velocities perpendicular and parallel to @xmath4 .",
    "the red markers indicate positions of the electron in the phase space at the same time as fig.[fig3]e ( lower marker ) and fig.[fig3]f ( upper marker ) .",
    "we checked a hundred most efficiently accelerated electrons trajectories and confirmed that all of them show essentially the same features as mentioned above , i.e. , trapping within the envelope troughs and successive perpendicular acceleration . in the next section",
    "the acceleration process is modeled and analyzed in detail .",
    "in the pic simulation shown above sharp magnetic envelope troughs are locally formed throughout the period of strong electron accelerations . in a successive decay process a number of daughter alfvn waves propagating both parallel and antiparallel to @xmath4 are excited . depending on their phases , amplitudes of some wave modes are sometimes locally canceled out each other , or they are simply less dominant in amplitude . then , there appear some regions where two oppositely propagating waves dominate . here",
    ", the envelope structures observed in the pic simulation are modeled by a superposition of such two oppositely propagating waves as follows .",
    "@xmath38 @xmath39 eq.([bw ] ) is equivallent to @xmath40 hereafter , we assume @xmath41 and @xmath42 are both positive without losing generality .",
    "typical waveforms at two different time domains are shown in fig.[fig4]a and b. the black solid and dashed lines denote @xmath43 and @xmath44 components of rotating carrier waves , and the gray lines represent envelopes which is independent of time . in the neighborhood of a trough , it is confirmed that eqs.([bw ] ) and ( [ ew ] ) give a reasonable model of a waveform observed in the pic simulation shown in fig.[fig4]c . in the following motion of a test particle in this system",
    "is analyzed .      in this section",
    "we consider motion of an electron in the electromagnetic waves given by eqs.([bw ] ) and ( [ ew ] ) .",
    "the equation of motion is @xmath45 @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 indicate charge and rest mass of the electron , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "when we write @xmath53 and introduce normalized variables as @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , eqs.([eqom ] ) and ( [ dxdt ] ) are written as follows .",
    "@xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 here , @xmath64 , and the dot denotes time derivative in terms of @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "note that a variation of normalized particle energy , or the lorentz factor , is given as @xmath66 in the following behaviours of the electron is discussed by using eqs.([dux])-([dgam ] ) .",
    "the above set of equations clearly has several fixed points as listed in table [ tbl1 ] . here",
    ", @xmath67 denotes a value of @xmath36 at a corresponding fixed point and @xmath68 .",
    "apparently , the fixed points i - iii ( iv - vi ) correspond to troughs ( crests ) of the magnetic envelope .",
    "as far as the acceleration is concerned , it is easily inferred that the fixed points iv - vi are not important since the electric field strength is very weak around there .",
    "actually , efficient acceleration observed in the pic simulation always occurs around the troughs of the magnetic envelope .",
    "therefore , only the fixed points i - iii are focused here .",
    "stability of these fixed points is discussed in the following .",
    "expanding eqs.([dux])-([dgam ] ) around the fixed point i and retaining only the first order terms , we obtain @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes small first order quantities .    from eqs.([delua ] ) and ( [ delx ] ) , we have @xmath75 the above expression represents a trapping oscillation with trapping frequency @xmath76 , which is rewritten with the original parameters as @xmath77 .    from eqs.([delue ] ) , ( [ delpsi ] ) , and ( [ delgam ] ) , on the other hand , we obtain @xmath78 here , the first term in the parenthesis ( or the second term in the right hand side of eq.([delpsi ] ) ) arises from the variation of the lorentz factor , i.e. , due to the relativistic effect . in the non - relativistic limit , therefore , eq.([ddue ] ) represents a trapping motion in the perpendicular momentum space with frequency @xmath79 .",
    "however , in the relativistic case with @xmath80 , @xmath81 ( and @xmath82 ) diverges in time .",
    "when @xmath67 is small enough so that @xmath83 , the above inequality is hardly satisfied . in such a case ,",
    "the fixed point is stable .",
    "but if @xmath67 becomes large and the inequality is satisfied , such an electron gains transverse energy while it keeps being trapped in the @xmath5direction .",
    "we consider this solution later more in detail .    for the fixed point ii , equations corresponding to eqs.([ddua ] ) and ( [ ddue ] )",
    "are obtained by formally changing the sign of @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , the system is unstable for parallel fluctuations while it is stable for perpendicular fluctuations .",
    "this fixed point is actually conjugate to the relativistic fixed point discussed above .",
    "another fixed point ( iii ) , conjugate to the nonrelativistic one , which should be a saddle point in @xmath85 phase space , appears at @xmath86 as singular points of @xmath87 , where @xmath88 .      in order to study perpendicular dynamics",
    "let us first consider a reduced system in which parallel quantities are fixed at the fixed point , i.e. , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "then we only have to consider the following two equations .",
    "@xmath92 here , @xmath93 has been introduced .",
    "this system has a hamiltonian defined as @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are satisfied .",
    "contours of the hamiltonian for @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 are represented as gray lines of the upper ( linear scale ) and lower panels ( logarithmic scale ) in fig.[fig5]a .",
    "the above parameters are chosen so that the waves interacting with the accelerated electron in the second acceleration stage observed in the pic simulation ( fig.[fig3]e ) is appropriately reproduced .",
    "it is easily confirmed that a center at @xmath100 , which is clearly recognized in the lower panel , corresponds to the nonrelativistic stable fixed point of the fixed point i and another center at @xmath101 , which can be seen both in the upper and lower panels , to the relativistic fixed point ii discussed above .",
    "the nonrelativistic center should satisfy the following condition from table [ tbl1 ] .",
    "@xmath102 although @xmath103 in the small amplitude limit , it is never satisfied in the nonrelativistic case since @xmath104 . therefore , the nonrelativistic center appears only when wave amplitude becomes finite .",
    "the closed trajectories around this center essentially coincides with the nonresonant trapping discussed by @xcite .    at the relativistic center",
    ", the resonance condition @xmath103 should be satisfied in the ultrarelativistic limit , since @xmath105 is negligible . in such a case relativistic decrease of the gyro frequency allows another resonance with low frequency waves .",
    "this resonance can also be present in small amplitude limit .",
    "relativistic linear resonance conditions between an electron and two oppositely propagating waves ( @xmath106 ) are shown in fig.[fig5]c .",
    "the two resonance lines intersect at @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 are satisfied , while there never appears such an intersection in nonrelativistic limit .",
    "this indicates that an electron can resonate simultaneously with two waves in the relativistic case . by using eq.([hamilton ] ) , the maximum width of the separatrix in @xmath36 is estimated as @xmath110 furthermore , the maximum @xmath36 on the separatrix is given by @xmath111 for instance , @xmath112 for the parameters used in fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "this gives a good agreement with the electron energy achieved in the end of the second acceleration stage observed in the pic simulation .",
    "so far we have only looked at a subset of the system in which @xmath113 .",
    "if we allow @xmath114 to slightly deviated from zero , it should satisfy @xmath115 around the fixed point in the original system eqs.([dux])-([dxi ] ) .",
    "hence , the system is stable for @xmath116 and is unstable for @xmath117 in terms of parallel fluctuations . the black solid line in fig.[fig5]a and [ fig5]b shows a numerical solution of eqs.([dux])-([dxi ] ) .",
    "a trajectory of the electron initially positioned near the separatrix at @xmath118 ( indecated by a small arrow in fig.[fig5]a ) is represented .",
    "the electron moves alomost along the separatrix when it is in @xmath119 .",
    "but when the electron enters in @xmath117 , its trajectory starts deviating from the separatrix . and",
    "finally it is clearly detrapped when it approaches @xmath120 .",
    "the trajectory in the momentum space shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5]b is very similar to what is observed in the pic simulation which is again plotted as a gray line .",
    "let us briefly discuss the power - law like distribution of electorns in the current acceleration process .",
    "it is shown in fig.[fig2]a that a high energy tail with power - law index @xmath121 evolves in the late stage of the simulation .",
    "this power - law nature may be related with power - law spectrum of wave amplitude of magnetic fluctuations . in the stage of successive decay instabilities ( @xmath122 )",
    "a spectral cascade of the magnetic fluctuations occurs with keeping a power - law index of the wave amplitudes almost constant with @xmath123 ( fig.[fig2]b ) .",
    "the enhancement of the wave amplitude at higher wavenumber regime , @xmath124 , is the remnant of initial parent wave and side band waves generated by the modulational instabilities in the early stage of the run . in order to confirm correlations between the wave and electron energy spectra , the following test particle simulation with periodic boundary conditions",
    "is performed .",
    "waves are given by superposition of a number of right hand polarized alfvn waves with power - law spectrum shown in fig.[fig6 ] ( power - law index @xmath125 is an external parameter ) , which models the lower wavenumber part of fig.[fig2]b .",
    "both positive and negative wavenumber modes are evenly distributed .",
    "the wave form is given by @xmath126 where @xmath127 and @xmath128 are initial wave phases which are randomly distributed at @xmath129 , and corresponding transverse electric fields are given by @xmath130 .",
    "the power - law index @xmath125 is fixed to 1.0 for @xmath131 , where @xmath132 and @xmath133 is the coherence wavenumber .",
    "the system size @xmath134 is common for all the following runs , and @xmath135 and @xmath136 if not specified .",
    "in such a system where a number of waves propagate in two opposite directions , particles are expected to be stochastically accelerated via second order fermi like process .",
    "first , this is confirmed by solving nonrelativistic equations of motion of @xmath137 electrons .",
    "an initial distribution function is given as a spatially homogeneous gyrotropic ring distribution with @xmath138 .",
    "fig.[fig7 ] shows distributions in ( a ) @xmath139 and ( b ) @xmath140 phase spaces , and ( c ) energy distribution functions at two different times , @xmath141 and @xmath142 , respectively , where @xmath143 denotes particle velocity and @xmath144 is normalized kinetic energy .",
    "the solid gray lines in fig.[fig7]b denote envelope profiles of given magnetic fluctuations .",
    "the particles are spatially bunched around the troughs of the magnetic envelopes because of mirror effect . in the velocity space",
    "the particles rapidly pitch angle diffuse ( fig.[fig7]a ) while the averaged particle energy slowly increases in time ( fig.[fig7]c ) .",
    "these are the features of a stochastic or a second order fermi acceleration . in comparison ,",
    "drastic changes occur if relativistic effects are taken into account .",
    "the simulation results with the same initial conditions as in the nonrelativistic case are plotted in fig.[fig8 ] with the same format as fig.[fig7 ] . here ,",
    "the normalized kinetic energy is defined as @xmath145 .",
    "compared with the nonlerativistic case , the maximum particle energies at each corresponding time are extremely higher , and they are at the same order as that obtained from eq.([maxu ] ) with @xmath146 and @xmath147 ( the black solid and black dashed lines in fig.[fig8]c ) . spatial bunching of particles similar to the nonrelativistic case is found in fig.[fig8]b , while a fraction of the bunched particles are accelerated to extremely high energies .",
    "such high energy particles have rather large pitch angles , denoting perpendicular acceleration ( fig.[fig8]a ) .",
    "interestingly , a power - law like energy distribution appears only at @xmath141 in fig.[fig8]c , although the corresponding energy range in the distribution function is small ( the black solid line ) .",
    "the power - law index does not change even in the case with a different initial ring velocity , @xmath148 ( not shown ) .",
    "however , the spectrum becomes softer when @xmath149 is assumed ( the gray dashed line in fig.[fig8]c ) .",
    "when the coherence wavenumber is large as @xmath150 , the bulk electrons are accelerated and the energy distribution is no longer power - law at @xmath141 ( the gray dotted line in fig.[fig8]c ) . it is noted from eqs.([width ] ) and ( [ maxu ] ) that the minimum @xmath36 of the separatrix of the relativistic resonance of the dominant wave mode at @xmath146 decreases with increasing @xmath133 .",
    "hence , most of electrons which initially distribute below the separatrix can enter inside the separatrix through stochastic motions at rather early stage , and they can be perpendicularly accelerated within a short time in the similar way seen in the previous section ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig5 ] ) .",
    "the peak energy is roughly consistent with the @xmath151 estimated by using @xmath147 and @xmath152 from eq.([maxu ] ) .",
    "in contrast , for small wave amplitude , @xmath153 , the maximum energy at @xmath141 is much smaller than the value obtained from eq.([maxu ] ) ( not shown ) .",
    "the reason may be that in this run the minimum @xmath36 of the separatrix is rather high because of its narrow width so that particles which initially distribute far below the separatrix have not entered in it until this time .",
    "in fig.[fig8]c the power - law like nature appears as a transient state in the system at @xmath141 for @xmath154 . in this run , at later time ( @xmath155 ) , high energy end of the particle distribution is so enhanced that the energy distribution does not fit the power - law spectrum(black dashed line ) .",
    "it is confirmed that the hump of the high energy part grows at least till @xmath156 .",
    "after sufficiently long time , it probably results in bulk acceleration as seen in the case of small @xmath133 . in the pic simulation",
    "the wave spectrum is not time stationary but cascading through the successive decay instabilities as already mentioned . in other words ,",
    "a wave with a certain wavenumber has finite life time .",
    "this may be why the high energy tail evolves without extra accumulation at high energy end of the distribution function in the late stage , @xmath157 , of the pic simulation ( fig.[fig2]a ) . to confirm this ,",
    "an additional test particle simulation is performed by assuming that wavenumber of the magnetic field with maximum intensity varies in time as @xmath158 which gives a reasonable fit in the late stage of the pic simulation . the particle distribution and waves at @xmath141 in the run corresponding to the black solid line in fig.[fig8]c",
    "are chosen as initial conditions .",
    "then , in the later time @xmath155 high energy tail extends roughly obeying the power - law and some low energy particles remain unaccelerated , as shown in fig.[fig8]c as the gray solid line .",
    "in the present paper an efficient particle acceleration process in the course of successive parametric instabilities of large amplitude alfvn waves was investigated .",
    "the acceleration takes place as a result of interactions between coherent waves in the developing alfvn turbulence and relativistic particles .",
    "an important point is that relativistic wave - particle interactions allow simultaneous resonance between a particle and two different waves .",
    "the maximum attainable energy through this acceleration process was analytically estimated .    in this acceleration process",
    "a high energy particle is preferentially accelerated . during the successive decay instabilities , a peak of the wave fourier spectrum shifts in time toward a lower frequency ( longer wavelength ) regime .",
    "because of relativistic decrease of particle s gyro frequency , low frequency waves preferentially resonate with and accelerate particles with large energy . therefore ,",
    "if once a particle is accelerated and its effective mass is increased , in later time such a particle easilt satisfies the resonance condition with lower frequency waves generated by successive decay processes .",
    "fig.[fig3]a shows an example of such an electron s energy time history in which one can recognize four acceleration phases around @xmath159 , and @xmath160 .    by utilizing test particle simulations in section 4",
    ", it is shown that relativistic effetcs are essential in producing nonthermal particles .",
    "note that the system discussed in section 3 is exactly the same as that discussed by @xcite , although they mainly focused on stochastic off - resonance diffusion in the phase space with an application to planetary magnetospheres in mind . actually , the regular trajectories in fig.3(d ) in @xcite correspond to the relativistic resonance focused in this paper .",
    "enhancement of lyapunov exponent at @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is an integer , shown in their fig.8 might be related with the relativistic resonance . in our test particle simulation",
    "the power - law like energy distribution function similar to what was observed in the pic simulation is reproduced by assuming the time evolving fourier spectrum of alfvn turbulence .",
    "finite life time of a wave mode in developing turbulence may contribute to creation of such a distribution function .",
    "however , details of the acceleration process including analytical estimate of the power - law index are still unclear and will be investigated in the near future .",
    "the acceleration process discussed in this paper is essentially different from some of the recently studied coherent acceleration processes , i.e. , electron surfing acceleration and wakefield acceleration . in these processes",
    "electrostatic field plays essential roles .",
    "furthermore , the processes mainly affect electrons since generated electrostatic waves have rather high frequencies , while ion acceleration may also occur in a very late stage of nonlinear evolution of a system @xcite . in the acceleration process discussed here",
    "roles of electrostatic fields are subdominant , although they are necessary for the decay instabilities .",
    "it should be noted further that the process may be able to act on ions too when a left hand polarized wave is introduced as an initial parent wave .",
    "the alfvn waves are essentially incompressible so that they may survive for rather long period compared with electrostatic langmuir or ion acoustic waves .",
    "hence , the process may last for long time , and may also follow the above mentioned electrostatic acceleration processes in some occasions .    in the present study all the multidimensional effects have been excluded . in higher dimensional cases daughter waves propagating in oblique to the ambient magnetic field can also have finite growth rates @xcite .",
    "it is confirmed by mhd simulation that these waves destroy the planar structure assured in a one dimensioal simulation @xcite .",
    "however , in low frequency regime the decay instability of parallel progagation is dominant @xcite . therefore , at least in such a regime the acceleration process observed here are expected to work , while acceleration rate may decrease to some degree because of appearance of nonplanar structures .",
    "this is similar to what is discussed for electron surfing acceleration in which the acceleration takes place even in two dimensional cases despite decrease of acceleration rate @xcite . at all events ,",
    "further investigations are necessary for estimate efficiency of this acceleration process in a more realistic situation .",
    "we finally give a comment on applications of this acceleration process .",
    "since the situation simulated in section 2 is rather general , there may be several fields of application like a pulsar wind nebula , a pulsar magnetosphere , an outflow of grb , and an agn jet , and so on .",
    "vicinity of a relativistic shock is probably one of the candidates .",
    "similary to the earth s foreshock , large amplitude alfvn waves may be generated by beam - plasma interactions between backstreaming ions and an upstream plasma , and the waves nonlineary evolve via parametric instabilities .",
    "since the acceleration is efficient and locally takes place , it may contribute to the so - called injection process into the dsa .",
    "as another possible case , cosmic ray - plasma interactions upstream of a supernova remnant shock are now extensively studied after the pioneering works by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "most of such studies pay attention to amplification of upstream magnetic fluctuations that can be scatterers of cosmic rays .",
    "and that is expected to result in increase of maximum attainable energy in the dsa process .",
    "on the other hand , amplified magnetic fluctuations may lead to the local and the coherent acceleration process discussed here .",
    "in other words , some particles may be accelerated through this process without crossing a shock . in this sense",
    "the process is similar to the so - called second order fermi acceleration , although an efficiency of the acceleration process discussed here is much higher than that of the second order fermi process as shown by the test particle simulation .",
    "the authors thank victor muoz for useful discussions .",
    "the pic simulation was performed by the super computer in isas / jaxa sagamihara .",
    "this work was supported in part by incentive aid to the prominent research , interdisciplinary graduate school of engineering sciences , kyushu university 2007 .",
    "according to @xcite , an equation of motion of an electron in a monochromatic circularly polarized wave in a wave frame is reduced as @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the pitch angle cosine , @xmath165 the particle gyrophase with respect to the wave phase , and @xmath166 is hamiltonian .",
    "the above expressions are held even when relativistic effects are taken into account by putting @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "electron trajectries interacting with the parent wave ( @xmath169 and @xmath170 ) for different values of @xmath171 are plotted in fig.[figa ] . here ,",
    "@xmath172 is assumed since the value is derived as average one at @xmath173 in the pic simulation .",
    "the factor of @xmath174 is neglected because of its smallness .",
    "fig.[figa ] is essentially the same as fig.5 in @xcite .",
    "the maximum value of half the width of the separatrix is @xmath24 ( at @xmath175 ) , which roughly coincides with the standard deviation of pitch angle observed in the pic simulation at @xmath173 ( fig.[fig2]c ) .",
