    "hd  209458b has the distinction of being the first identified transiting extrasolar planet @xcite .",
    "this 0.69 jupiter - mass planet orbits a g0v stellar primary ( k@xmath3=6.3 ) every 3.52 days and was the first exoplanet with a detected atmosphere @xcite .",
    "it was also one of the first planets found to emit detectable amounts of infrared radiation @xcite .",
    "the dayside mid - infrared spectrum for this planet , based on spitzer irs observations , has been previously obtained @xcite .",
    "mid - infrared dayside photometry @xcite provides evidence for an atmospheric temperature inversion @xcite and has been used to support a classification scheme for the hot - jupiter type exoplanets @xcite .",
    "mid - infrared photometric measurements of the orbital phase light curve of hd  209458b @xcite find that the dayside and nightside brightness temperatures are similar .",
    "models of atmospheric circulation for hd  209458b suggest that the zonal wind structure is a function of altitude @xcite , and mid - infrared dayside emission could vary @xcite .",
    "the recent announcement of the detection of h@xmath2o and ch@xmath1 in the terminator regions of the hot - jupiter hd  189733b ( swain , vasisht & tinetti 2008b ; hereafter svt08 ) via near - infrared spectroscopy using the hubble space telescope ( hst ) demonstrated that molecular spectroscopy of bright transiting planets is possible .",
    "the subsequent hst detection of h@xmath2o , co@xmath2 , and carbon monoxide ( co ) on the dayside of hd 189733b provides significant constraints for atmospheric models and suggests that exoplanet molecular spectroscopy may become routine ( swain et al .",
    "2009 ; hereafter s09 ) in the near future .",
    "this is significant because molecules provide a powerful tool for determining the conditions , composition , and chemistry of exoplanet atmospheres . in this paper",
    ", we report on the first ever spectroscopic detection of molecules in the atmosphere of hd  209458b , making this the second exoplanet for which molecular spectroscopy has now been demonstrated .",
    "we observed hd  209458 for five consecutive hst orbits using the nicmos camera in imaging - spectroscopy mode covering the wavelengths 1.52.5 @xmath0 m using the g206 grism .",
    "as in previous observations ( svt08 , s09 ) , the defocus mode was used , resulting in a spectral resolution of @xmath4 .",
    "observations were conducted on june 15 , 2008 , from ut 09:38:59 to ut 16:45:24 .",
    "a total of 310 usable snapshot spectra were acquired with an individual exposure time of @xmath5 s. using the system ephemeris @xcite we determine that the bulk of the first two orbits ( @xmath6 & @xmath7 ) coincides with the pre - ingress light curve , the third and part of the fourth orbit ( @xmath8 & @xmath9 ) cover the occultation , while the fifth orbit ( @xmath10 ) is post - egress ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . we find that 75 exposures cover the full eclipse , 43 exposures are in ingress / egress , and 192 exposures cover the pre - ingress or post - egress intervals .",
    "the effective exposure time for each spectrum was @xmath5 s. to determine the spectrometer wavelength calibration , narrow band ( f190 ) filter calibration exposures were acquired during @xmath6 .",
    "our data analysis methods , based on decorrelation of instrument parameters from the measured spectrophotometric light curves , have been described previously ( svt08 , s09 ) . for the results presented here ,",
    "the data - analysis approach remains largely unchanged but is updated in two significant ways .",
    "first , the decorrelation for instrument parameters is based on detector pixel values ; in the past we averaged the detector data to the defocused spectral resolution prior to the decorrelation .",
    "the new approach has the advantage of determining the corrected , decorrelated spectrum using the full oversampling of the instrument .",
    "second , we now derotate and shift the spectrum ( via interpolation ) to achieve the same sampling at all wavelengths and times .",
    "this effectively places observations in a common , pixel - based , reference frame .",
    "we tested this new reduction method by computing a dayside spectrum of hd  189733b and comparing it to our previous result ( s09 ) ; the agreement between the two methods was found to be excellent , with differences between the spectra always within the statistical uncertainty of the measurement . as with our previous observations of the primary and secondary eclipse of hd  189733b , we found the instrument parameters for the first orbit , @xmath11 , differed significantly from the remaining orbits , @xmath12@xmath13 ; following our previous approach ( svt08 , s09 ) , we omitted the @xmath11 spectra from the analysis .",
    "to add an additional constraint to any possible orbit - to - orbit brightness changes , we arranged for contemporaneous , high - precision , visible photometry using the micro - variability and oscillations of stars ( most ) satellite @xcite .",
    "the most observations were timed to provide a photometry measurement during each hst orbit ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , and the data were calibrated using the method described by @xcite .",
    "the near - infrared dayside spectrum of hd  209458b shows three clear peaks at 1.6 , 1.81.9 , and 2.2 @xmath0 m , while between the peaks the flux density decreases to near - zero ( within the measurement error ) .",
    "the spectrum has an average uncertainty per data point of @xmath14 , corresponding to a dynamic range of 13,300:1 ( 75 ppm ) , with a wavelength resolution of @xmath15 at 2 @xmath0 m . to maximize wavelength coverage for the spectral interpretation , we incorporated mid - infrared spitzer photometry data @xcite and spectroscopy data ( originally obtained by richardson et al .",
    "we have previously undertaken our own calibration of these spitzer irs data @xcite , and we use those results in the discussion that follows .",
    "the interpretation of the data was done using two independent spectral retrieval methods incorporating a line - by - line radiative transfer model ( @xcite , svt08 , s09 ) , and the results from both models are in agreement .",
    "the radiative transfer calculations assume local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) conditions , as expected for pressures exceeding 10@xmath16 bar that are probed by the near - infrared spectrum .",
    "we evaluated a variety of temperature ( @xmath17 ) together with the effects of ch@xmath1 , h@xmath2o and co@xmath2 , which are assumed to have constant mixing ratios .",
    "we use the ch@xmath1 line list of @xcite for temperatures at 800 , 1000 , and 1273 k to quantify the affects of ch@xmath1 at wavelengths of 1.582.5 @xmath0 m , outside of which we use absorption parameters by @xcite .",
    "the hot water lines from @xcite and @xcite were used to quantify the water features .",
    "absorption by co@xmath2 is calculated from the hitran hot co@xmath2 line list @xcite .",
    "absorption coefficients of h@xmath2o and co@xmath2 are calculated using line - by - line techniques every 0.004 @xmath18 wavenumbers .",
    "the radiative transfer calculation has 80 vertical grid points that extend from 10@xmath19 to 10 bar .",
    "the effects of particulates are excluded .",
    "the combination of near - infrared and mid - infrared data probes the temperature profile over a pressure range of a few bars to 10@xmath20 bars and provides evidence for a temperature inversion .",
    "the 8 @xmath0 m brightness temperature is 1770 k , while the 2.22.4 @xmath0 m brightness temperature ranges from 11001600 k ; this temperature difference , combined with the difference in pressure probed by these wavelengths , indicates the presence of a temperature inversion .",
    "we find that a temperature inversion could occur somewhere between @xmath21 @xmath22@xmath23 bar , where temperatures increase by roughly 500700 k. this temperature - inverted region resembles those of planetary stratospheres ; it occurs at a similar pressure level and causes a convectively stable temperature profile . the model spectrum from three exemplar temperature profiles ( inverted ) are shown in fig .",
    "3 ( together with a temperature profile with no inversion ) , and the model residuals ( fig .",
    "4 ) show the improved fit with a temperature inversion .",
    "the presence of the stratosphere coupled with a relatively steep stratospheric temperature gradient implies the existence of a local absorber that heats the atmosphere and maintains the local temperature structure .",
    "the temperature profile we derive confirms the previous identification of a @xmath17 inversion @xcite , but the profile reported here differs in terms of the detailed shape .",
    "our estimates for the temperature profile and molecular mixing ratios are based on modeling the combined near - infrared and mid - infrared data sets .",
    "however , the recent finding of variability in the mid - infrared emission spectrum of hd  189733b @xcite suggests caution is needed when deriving constraints from the noncontemporaneous mid - ir data .",
    "although the presence of h@xmath2o and ch@xmath1 can explain most of the spectrum , we find that an additional absorber is required around 2.1 @xmath0 m , and we attribute this to co@xmath2 .",
    "the evidence for a temperature inversion comes from the mid - infrared spectrum , and the mid - infrared data provide some additional constraints on the mixing ratios for h@xmath2o and co@xmath2 .",
    "we find that a range of temperature profiles and molecular mixing ratios are consistent with the data as illustrated by the models shown in fig . 4 and the sample contribution functions shown in fig . 5 , which correspond to three possible temperature profiles .",
    "providing improved observational constraints on the location of the tropopause and the molecular mixing ratios will require additional observations , for which there are two possibilities .",
    "the first is to improve the spectral coverage and/or spectral resolution of the dayside spectrum , which could be done in the future with jwst .",
    "the second is to use a transmission spectrum ( obtained during primary eclipse ) to estimate the molecular abundances in the terminator regions ; subject to some assumptions , this could be used to place constraints on the abundance of one or more molecules .",
    "hst transmission spectra for this planet have been obtained and are being analyzed by our team .",
    "however , the interpretation of the transmission spectrum is complex due to the presence of temporal variability ( the subject of a forthcoming paper ) .",
    "there are two important caveats concerning our derived temperature profiles .",
    "first is the assumption of emission from a uniform disk rather than from a realistic irradiated hemisphere ; as such , the spectrum and t - profile we derive is disk - averaged .",
    "second , the spectral retrieval process used in our best fitting models implicitly acknowledges the possible role of dynamics in establishing atmospheric temperature by relaxing typical 1-line model constraints on the temperature gradient .",
    "thus , portions of the atmosphere of hd  209458b may support departures from radiative equilibrium .",
    "fully self - consistent modeling would require handling heat advection in the context of a global circulation model , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "it is worth noting that the presence of a relatively strong dayside temperature inversion significantly complicates the spectral retrieval process for hd  209458b relative to the case of hd  189733b .    given that the dayside emission spectra for hd  189733b and hd  209458b have been observed with nearly identical instrument configurations , we can make a preliminary comparison of these two planets ( see fig .",
    "6 ) . for the present , we restrict this discussion to the near - infrared to avoid the complications introduced by the presence of mid - infrared variability observed in hd  189733b @xcite . in both planets ,",
    "the near - infrared dayside emission spectrum probes the @xmath24 bar portion of the atmosphere .",
    "similarities  both planets show the presence of h@xmath2o , co@xmath2 , and @xmath25 for pressures near 1 bar .",
    "differences  the abundance of ch@xmath1 is significantly enhanced in hd  209458b relative to hd  189733b , and the temperature at 1 bar is higher in hd  209458b , as well .",
    "the observed differences in the near - infrared dayside spectra of these two hot - jupiters are likely due to differences in temperature and composition ; hd209458b is dominated by ch@xmath1 absorption features , while hd  189733b is dominated by absorption from h@xmath2o and co@xmath2 .",
    "in summary , we have presented the first near - infrared spectrum of light emitted by hd  209458b . using an iterative forward model approach for spectral retrieval",
    ", we find that h@xmath2o , ch@xmath1 , and co@xmath2 , together with a temperature inversion , are present in the dayside atmosphere of hd  209458b .",
    "there are a range of temperature profiles and molecular abundance solutions that are consistent with the data .",
    "additional observational constraints on the atmospheric temperature structure and composition will require either improved wavelength coverage / spectral resolution for the dayside spectrum or a transmission spectrum .",
    "we note that some of the temperature profiles consistent for these observations raise the question of whether the dayside atmosphere is in radiative equilibrium .",
    "although advection of heat could support departures from radiative equilibrium , our present knowledge of most molecular opacities at high temperatures limits our ability to determine decisively whether the radiative equilibrium condition is met or not ; thus there is an urgent need for further laboratory studies to obtain molecular databases for determining high temperature opacities of the most common molecules expected in hot - jupiter atmospheres .",
