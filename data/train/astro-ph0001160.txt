    "it has been shown @xcite that in order to obtain a reasonable efficiency , the grb itself must arise from internal shocks ( iss ) within the flow , while the afterglow is due to the external shock ( es ) produced as the flow is decelerated upon collision with the ambient medium . in the simplest version of the fireball model , a spherical blast wave expands into a cold and homogeneous ambient medium ( waxman 1997 ; mszros , p. & rees , m. 1997 ; katz & piran 1997 ; sari , piran & narayan 1998 , hereafter spn ) .",
    "an important variation is a density profile @xmath7 , suitable for a massive star progenitor which is surrounded by its pre - explosion wind .    in this letter",

    "we assume that the electrons ( initially ) and the magnetic field ( always ) hold fractions @xmath10 and @xmath11 of the internal energy , respectively .",
    "we consider synchrotron emission of relativistic electrons which are accelerated by a strong blast wave into a power law energy distribution : @xmath12 for @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the number density and internal energy density in the local frame and we have used the standard value , @xmath16 .    after being accelerated by the shock , the electrons cool due to synchrotron radiation losses .",

    "the spectrum consists of four power law segments : @xmath30 and @xmath31 , from low to high frequencies .",
    "the spectral slope above @xmath23 is related to the electron injection distribution : the number of electrons with lorentz factors @xmath32 is @xmath33 and their energy @xmath34 .",
