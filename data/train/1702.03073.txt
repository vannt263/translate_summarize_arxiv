    "over the last few decades the studies of bose - einstein condensates have revealed several interesting features arising from a nonlinearity that stems from a mean field picture of atomic interactions .",
    "this leads to a nonlinear schr@xmath5dinger equation which in this context is called the gross pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) since the condensates are produced in a trapping potential @xcite-@xcite . while the statics and dynamics of the single species condensate has been exhaustively researched , that of the binary condensate is somewhat more problematic and hence some questions remain at a fairly basic level when an analytic treatment is attempted . some of these have to do with oscillation frequencies and dynamics of the condensate which is not in equilibrium @xcite .",
    "an useful approximation scheme has been discussed by navarro et al @xcite , who have used a variational model @xcite with a gaussian trial function for each of the two condensates .",
    "the trap is actually three dimensional .",
    "but one can vary the frequencies in different directions to produce very elongated ( cigar shaped ) or highly flattened ( pancake shaped ) condensate profile and thereby generating effectively one dimensional or effectively two dimensional condensate respectively . in this effective lower dimensional system ,",
    "the shape of the condensates does not change in the other directions meaning the other directions are frozen out .",
    "however , the dimensionality reduction is an approximation providing the effective one dimensional or two dimensional results instead of genuine one dimensional and two dimensional results . in principal",
    ", there are a number of techniques of reducing the relevant three dimensional gpe to an effectively one dimensional ( quasi - low dimensional ) dynamics @xcite .",
    "this quasi - condensate @xcite has the same density profile and local correlation properties as true condensates .",
    "we have recently found @xcite that introducing an approximation , based on ehrenfest equation , which is independent of the initial form of the wave function works well for the single component system and provides reliable results for initial shapes which are gaussian or localized hyperbolic functions . however , our approach is complementary to that of navarro et al who use a generalization of the variational technique . in this present work ,",
    "we show that a similar description using ehrenfest relations can be set up for the binary condensates also and can be very effective in probing whether there can be a nearly shape invariant properties of initial wave packets .",
    "another interesting set of problems in dynamics of binary bec involving rabi switching of condensate wave functions and the interface instability has been considered by @xcite .",
    "following the works of mccarron et al @xcite , it is possible to produce phase separated condensate and that should make the free expansion dynamics experimentally feasible . for the most part in sec ii , we focus on the following scenarios an equilibrium situation exists for the binary condensate in a trapping potential and at t=0 , the trap is switched off .",
    "one would like to know how the dynamics will proceed .",
    "in particular , we are interested in exploring how closely does an initial packet retains its shape i.e. , how much coherent it is . with this in mind",
    ", we introduce an ehrenfest equation based approach for studying the dynamics and show that it is a reasonably versatile tool for handling several issues in the dynamics of the binary condensates which remained unexplored .",
    "we analyse the dynamics both in homogeneous system and in phase separated regime with interesting combinations of parameters .",
    "we indicate the appearance of almost coherent wave packet for @xmath6 . the possibility of breakdown of the wave packet due to the collisions between the wave packets in the phase separated regime is also presented .    in sec iii ,",
    "we discuss over the following framework consider the equilibrium binary bec in a trapping potential and at @xmath7 , the trap frequency is changed .",
    "similar as in the sec ii , an interesting question then concerns the dynamics of the condensate in this framework .",
    "thereafter , we proceed to investigate the existence of shape invariant states both in mixed and overlapping initial condition . for two species @xmath8 and @xmath9 cgpe can be written as    @xmath10    where we have considered identical masses @xmath11 for both the species for simplicity in analysis .",
    "the interaction strengths ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath0 ) can be positive ( repulsive interaction ) or negative ( attractive interaction ) or combinations of them .    to write down the ehrenfest equations , we write eq.([eq1 ] ) as @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "as is often the case , we consider the highly anisotropic situation where an effective one dimensional solution emerges and one can replace the @xmath18 in eq.([eq1 ] ) or ( [ eq2 ] ) by @xmath19 . the initial wave function is taken to be @xmath20 i.e. , separable in the indices @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that this separability persists at later times and the wave function is @xmath21 hence the average position of species @xmath8 is @xmath22 and that of species @xmath9 is @xmath23 with similar results holding for any other operator @xmath24 .",
    "consequently , the ehrenfest equation for species @xmath8 reads @xmath25\\rangle_{\\alpha}+\\langle[o,\\big(g_{\\alpha}p_{\\alpha}+g_{\\alpha\\beta}p_{\\beta}\\big)]\\rangle_{\\alpha}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and a similar equation holds for species @xmath9 .",
    "we write the explicit answers for the first few moments for the species @xmath8 ( with similar equation holding for species @xmath9 )    @xmath26    these moment equations are exact and hold for all packets .",
    "consequently , they can lead to exact conservation laws which are not found from any other approach . for a free particle of only one species",
    ", we note that    @xmath27    while for the two species problem of free particles with equal number of particles for both the species , we find from eq.([eq4b ] ) along with its counterpart for species @xmath9 , @xmath28&=-g_{\\alpha\\beta}\\int^{\\infty}_{\\infty}\\big(p_{\\alpha}\\frac{dp_{\\beta}}{dx}+p_{\\beta}\\frac{dp_{\\alpha}}{dx}\\big)dx\\nonumber\\\\&=-g_{\\alpha\\beta}\\int^{\\infty}_{\\infty}\\frac{d}{dx}\\big(p_{\\alpha}p_{\\beta})dx\\nonumber\\\\&=0\\label{eq6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] indicating @xmath29 similarly from eq.([eq4d ] ) along with its counterpart for species @xmath9 , we deduce the following for equal number of particles of species @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath30 furthermore , for an arbitrary external potential @xmath31 , we get @xmath32 which for the single species problem reduces to @xmath33 the advantage of using ehrenfest s equation for exploring the dynamics lies in being able to obtain constraining equations like eq.([eq7])-eq.([eq10 ] ) .",
    "it should be noted though that while the presence of the interaction term in the gross - pitaevskii still allows to write some conservation laws till the second moment , there is a clear complication for the higher moments . in this case",
    "it is clear that for the third and higher moments , the phase of the evolving wave function is going to play an important role .",
    "we point this out with the single species problem for the free particle which is the simplest to implement .",
    "we find for the third moment ( now we have no subscript on @xmath34 and @xmath35 for @xmath36 ) @xmath37 @xmath38 where , @xmath39 @xmath40 in the above equation , @xmath41 is not a constant of motion , as can be easily seen from its dynamics @xmath42dx\\ ] ] the above equation , apart from establishing that @xmath41 is not constant for a free particle , also shows that development of @xmath41 requires knowledge of amplitude and phase of @xmath43 separately .",
    "this is a complication which shows that the higher order moments bring in the details of the dynamics of the wave function and are not determined by the moments alone .",
    "this is a fact that needs to be kept in mind while assessing the success in dealing with the low order moments .",
    "having pointed out a potential problem with higher moments , we now proceed to discuss specific time developments for the centres and the widths of the initial wave packet . for @xmath44 , we find by straight forward algebra from eq.([eq4a])-([eq4e ] ) @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the separation between the two centers .",
    "similarly the second moment @xmath47 , is found to have the dynamics ( exact ) .",
    "@xmath48 with a similar equations for the species @xmath9 . what about the probability distribution @xmath49 ?",
    "the structure will be assumed to have the form @xmath50 which makes the strong supposition that an initial form of the probability distribution ( provided through the initial condition for the gpe ) will be preserved with the time dependences appearing in @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the primary issue will be to check whether this assumption is reasonable or not . in the next two sections we will use this technique to discuss the dynamics of the wave packets separately in the free particle regime and in a simple harmonic confining potential .",
    "we consider the initial condition of eq.([eq2 ] ) appropriate at @xmath7 when the trap is switched off .",
    "subsequently the dynamics is that of a free system .    depending upon the sign of @xmath53",
    ", we can have phase separated or overlapping initial densities of the two species @xcite . for positive values of @xmath54 , we have overlapping wave functions and for @xmath55 , we have separated wave functions .",
    "we accordingly write the initial wave packets for species @xmath8 and @xmath9 as @xmath56 with the understanding that @xmath57 corresponds to overlapping initial conditions and @xmath58 corresponds to a phase separated state . in",
    "what follows , we will assume that it is possible to discuss the separate evolution of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , although the parameters of one will influence those of the others .    with the help of eq(s).([eq18 ] ) and",
