    "coherent states were initially introduced by schrdinger in 1926 @xcite in the context of classical - quantum correspondence of dynamical systems . after a dormant period of more than three decades , these states were re - casted in 1963 by glauber in the quantum mechanical description of coherent electromagnetic field @xcite . due to their special properties ,",
    "coherent states became indispensable to many research fields , such as , quantum optics @xcite , quantum information @xcite and quantum computation @xcite .",
    "in particular their ability to get entangled in various optical systems arose them as to become a key resource in many modern technologies , such as , quantum meterology@xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite , and various quantum gates @xcite .",
    "+ motivated by their usefulness and abandon applications in a large variety of disciplines @xcite , various generalization schemes have been introduced @xcite and the coherent states have been constructed for a large class of physical systems@xcite .",
    "the generalized coherent states for the systems possessing non - linear energy spectrum may take the potential to describe the non - linear quantum optics and can be useful in related technologies@xcite .",
    "moreover , such constructions take the promise to converge various research areas to motivate new interdisciplinary research , for instance , most recently coherent states have been used in string theory @xcite , squeezed states in non - commutative spaces @xcite and their entanglement generation by means of beam splitters @xcite .",
    "+ in this article generalized coherent states have been discussed in the context of position - dependent effective mass ( pdem ) systems .",
    "pdem systems are of great interest due to vast applications in various areas of physics @xcite .",
    "the quantum mechanical description of such systems becomes challenging due to the existence of position dependence in the kinetic energy term .",
    "pdem systems have been discussed extensively in the contexts of finding their solutions @xcite , ladder operators and associated algebras @xcite , constructing the coherent states @xcite . + most recently",
    ", a generalized scheme for constructing the ladder operator for pdem systems have been introduced @xcite . in present work , we will use these ladder operators to construct the coherent states for pdem systems .",
    "the general formalism has been applied to different quantum systems with spatially varying mass .",
    "various properties of the coherent states for these systems has been discussed .",
    "we close our work by some concluding remarks .",
    "the classical dynamics of a pdem system is governed by a hamiltonian , @xmath0 which can be quantized by considering the symmetric ordering of the operators concerning momentum and spatially varying mass @xcite as @xmath1 where @xmath2 represents the parameter that specify space - independent properties of the potential , such as range , strength and diffuseness .",
    "+ in order to obtain the corresponding ladder operators for the underlying system , we factorize the hamiltonian given in eq .",
    "( [ 1.3 ] ) , as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the ground - state energy of the hamiltonian @xmath5 and @xmath6 represent a pair of operators @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the super - potential depending on the parameter @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "however , it is important to note that these operators can not be treated as the ladder operators since their commutator @xmath9 $ ] , depends on the position variable @xmath10 @xcite . in order to overcome",
    "this difficulty we need to introduce new operators whose commutator is independent of any dynamical variables . an integrability condition known as shape invariance ( si )",
    "@xcite plays a vital role in this regard .",
    "the si condition in terms of the operators , defined in eq .",
    "( [ op ] ) , is given as @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the remainder term independent of the dynamical variables .",
    "this reparametrization of parameter @xmath14 is achieved by means of a similarity transformation , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a translation operator defined as @xmath17 such that @xmath18 . by means of the translation operator ( [ st ] ) and",
    "the operators ( [ op ] ) , we introduce a pair of new operators @xmath19 so that the integrability condition ( [ 4.1 ] ) , together with the similarity transformation introduced in eq .",
    "( [ ac ] ) , takes the form @xmath20=r(\\alpha_{0}),\\ ] ] which resembles the well known heisenberg weyl algebra and this suggests us to consider @xmath21 as the appropriate ladder operators @xcite .",
    "these ladder operators satisfy the relation @xmath22 which provide us with the eigenvalues of @xmath5 given in ( [ 1.3 ] ) , as @xmath23 in order to obtain the normalized eigenstates of @xmath5 , we see that the ladder operators act on the eigenstates @xmath24 , of the given system as @xmath25^{\\frac{1}{2}}|\\varphi_{n+1}\\rangle , \\nonumber\\\\ \\hat{l}_{-}(\\alpha_{1})|\\varphi_{n}\\rangle&= & \\bigg[\\sum_{k=1}^{n}r(\\alpha_{k})\\bigg]^{\\frac{1}{2}}|\\varphi_{n-1}\\rangle.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as a result the normalized eigenstates of @xmath5 are given as @xmath26 is the generalized factorial defined as @xmath27\\dots[r(\\alpha_{1})].\\ ] ]",
    "as mentioned before , the ladder operators provides a strong base for the construction of algebraic dependent coherent states .",
    "earlier , this kind of states have been constructed for the constant mass systems @xcite .",
    "our aim is to generalize this notion to incorporate the spatial dependence of mass .",
    "assume that the systems under consideration have infinite bound states .",
    "following the usual way of constructing coherent states for any quantum mechanical system , we define coherent states @xmath28 as eigenstates of the lowering operator @xmath29 , introduced in eq .",
    "( [ 4.6 ] ) , as @xmath30 where `` @xmath31 '' is a complex parameter . in order to derive an explicit expression for these coherent states , we express @xmath28 as a superposition of the eigenstates @xmath32 of the system under consideration as @xmath33 ) , we get @xmath34 which on simplification provides us with the following equation @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a constant that needs to be determined and @xmath37 is the generalized factorial introduced in eq .",

    "another important observation about these states is that although the states @xmath28 are normalized but they are not orthogonal to each other since @xmath43 + we now investigate the overcompleteness property of the generalized coherent states for the shape invariant potentials with pdem .",
