    "hadron colliders will produce the electroweak vector bosons @xmath1 and @xmath2 with a high rate at large energies , and many processes , like e.g.  higgs - boson production or heavy - quark production , can proceed via vector - boson vector - boson scattering .",
    "the experimental study of these and similar processes is expected to lead to an understanding of the higgs sector of the electroweak standard model and eventually of the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism .",
    "in addition , vector - boson pair production at hadron colliders will provide information on the self - couplings of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons and possibly play an important role in the search for new physics .    in lowest order ,",
    "vector bosons can be produced by quark - antiquark annihilation in hadron collisions .",
    "however , at high energies , higher - order processes where vector bosons emitted from incoming quarks or antiquarks initiate a hard scattering process can be enhanced by logarithmic factors and thus can compete with the lowest - order production mechanism . these processes",
    "have successfully been described with the help of the effective vector boson method ( evbm ) which applies the concept of partons in a hadron to the case of vector bosons : vector bosons are viewed as partons in quarks and electrons , as quarks and gluons are partons in hadrons . in analogy to the weizscker - williams approximation of qed @xcite the cross section for a scattering process @xmath3 at a center - of - mass energy @xmath4 is factorized into probability densities @xmath5 for finding a vector boson @xmath6 with polarization @xmath7 in the incoming fermion @xmath8 , and hard vector - boson scattering cross sections at a reduced center - of - mass energy @xmath9 : @xmath10 the basic assumptions in the effective vector boson method are that the dominant contributions for producing the final state @xmath11 is due to vector - boson initiated processes and that the cross section for the scattering of an off - shell vector boson can be related to the corresponding on - shell cross section .    in the application of the method to processes with two intermediate vector bosons ( see fig .",
    "1 ) it was assumed that convolutions of single - vector - boson probability densities are sufficient to obtain luminosities for vector - boson pairs , @xmath12 which can be used to express the cross section for two - fermion scattering in terms of the vector - boson vector - boson scattering cross section : @xmath13    ( 4,6 ) ( -.2,5.3)@xmath14 ( -.2,0.8)@xmath15 ( 3.3,5.3)@xmath16 ( 3.3,0.8)@xmath17 ( 4.,3.0)@xmath18 ( -.1,4.2)@xmath19 ( -.1,2.0)@xmath20 ( -6.5,-8.0 )    the possibility to generalize the equivalent photon approximation to the case of massive vector bosons was first noted in @xcite and explicitly formulated in @xcite .",
    "originally , the concept was invented for the description of processes at very high energies and thus included a number of approximations valid at high energies only .",
    "these approximations were partly of kinematic origin and concerned the neglect of mass terms , or of the transverse momentum of the intermediate vector bosons . according to the details of the approximation",
    ", a variety of versions for vector - boson distributions with differing numerical results can be found in the literature .",
    "the most simple of these approximations  the leading logarithmic approximation ( lla)amounts to taking a zero - mass limit .",
    "in addition , since it was observed that for the production of a heavy higgs particle in vector - boson scattering the cross section is dominated by longitudinal polarization @xcite , first applications of the method neglected contributions from transversely polarized vector bosons and the interference between amplitudes for different polarizations .    comparisons with exact calculations have shown that the method is indeed helpful and leads to reliable results , in particular for higgs boson production @xcite and for heavy fermion production @xcite . the application to vector - boson vector - boson scattering off",
    "the higgs resonance @xcite was less successful ; the effective vector boson method overestimated the exact result @xcite . adding the ( positive ) contribution from transversely polarized vector bosons @xcite",
    "could , of course , not lead to an improved agreement between the evbm and exact calculations for vector - boson pair production .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that approximations of kinematic origin can be avoided and a set of exact vector - boson distributions was derived . there",
    "it was also shown that interference terms ( i.e.non-diagonal contributions ) do not appear in the case of single - vector - boson processes ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the only remaining necessary assumption in using the evbm for single - vector - boson processes concerned the off - shell behaviour of the hard scattering cross section .",
    "we will show that the improvement obtained with the results of @xcite is not sufficient to accurately describe two - vector - boson processes .",
    "the simple convolution of two single - vector - boson probabilities as in eq .",
    "( [ deflumi ] ) ignores the mutual influence of the emission of one boson on the probability for the emission of another .",
    "in addition , interference contributions need not vanish , as has been noticed in the specific example of higgs boson production in @xcite .",
    "this is in analogy to two - photon processes @xcite where it was shown already in @xcite that the extension of the weizscker - williams method from one photon to the case of two photons is not straightforward .",
    "the main purpose of the present work is the extension of the effective vector boson method to the case of processes with two vector bosons , as needed in the study of vector - boson vector - boson scattering .",
    "it thus combines the exact treatment of the two - boson kinematics , presented for photons in @xcite , with the exact definition of vector - boson distributions , presented for single vector bosons in @xcite .",
    "our derivation ( section 2 ) will not use any kinematic approximation .",
    "it turns out that non - diagonal terms are indeed needed . in section 3",
    ", we will present exact luminosity functions for vector - boson pairs in quark or electron initiated processes .",
    "one can then identify the additional approximation needed to reduce these luminosities to convolutions of the exact single - vector - boson densities of @xcite ( section 4 ) and in the high energy limit we also recover the leading logarithmic versions of vector - boson distributions as used in the literature ( section 5 ) .",
    "finally , in section 6 we will also present numerical results for these exact luminosities and compare them with the ones of simplified approaches .    despite of the fact that both single - vector - boson distributions and two - vector - boson luminosities can be obtained exactly without any approximation ,",
    "there remains the question whether the set of feynman diagrams that can be described with the help of the evbm is indeed the dominating one .",
    "the answer to this problem depends on the process and has to be found in a case - by - case study .",
    "of particular concern in this respect is the question whether the considered subset of diagrams is gauge invariant . in @xcite",
    "it was observed that for off - shell vector - boson scattering there may occur strong gauge cancellations between those contributions taken into account in the evbm and bremsstrahlung diagrams which are ignored .",
    "motivated by this , kunszt and soper @xcite argued that the extrapolation to off - shell masses is not always guaranteed , but for heavy higgs - boson production they show in an axial gauge the validity of the basic assumption that the extrapolation to off - shell masses is indeed a smooth one .",
    "our final explicit expressions for the two - vector - boson luminosities are obtained with specific simple assumptions for the off - shell behaviour of the vector - boson scattering cross sections .",
    "however , we keep a clean separation of exactly calculable parts and model assumptions and our expressions are written in a form which allows for an easy accommodation of an improved off - shell dependence , as soon as the corresponding information would be available .",
    "apart from these caveats , our luminosities are exact results of a calculation of a subset of feynman diagrams .",
    "in particular , their range of validity is not restricted to large energies .",
    "therefore we will also present some of the results for an energy of @xmath21 gev , relevant for a next - generation @xmath0 collider .",
    "the alternative approach of using convolutions of the lla single - vector - boson distributions is not applicable at these small energies .",

    "we will use this form in our numerical examples .",
    "related to the different possible choices of the argument of the logarithm is the interpretation of the scaling variable @xmath155 . in @xcite ,",

    ", the calculation was performed using a longitudinal polarization vector for on - shell vector bosons , whereas in @xcite @xmath253 was defined taking into account that the vector bosons have off - shell masses @xmath254 .",
    "this and a more sophisticated assumption concerning the off - shell behaviour of the hard scattering cross section in @xcite is the reason for the difference between the distribution functions for longitudinal polarization in @xcite and @xcite . the distribution for transversely polarized vector bosons in @xcite and @xcite agree with each other ( after correcting misprints in the latter reference ) . of course",
    ", all distributions agree in the leading logarithmic approximation .",
    "in presenting numerical results for luminosities of vector - boson pairs , we restrict ourselves to the representative case of @xmath0 annihilation . in our examples for the numerical evaluation we used @xmath255 , @xmath256 gev , @xmath257 gev and the fermion vector - boson couplings",

    "the luminosity @xmath238 for transversely polarized @xmath1 is the biggest one , followed by @xmath261 and @xmath240 . from fig .  3",
    "one concludes that the non - diagonal luminosities @xmath262 and @xmath263 are comparable in size with the diagonal ones and thus can not be neglected .",
    "the parity violating luminosity @xmath264 varies comparatively little with @xmath155 at not too high @xmath155 , and at higher @xmath155 it becomes equal to the @xmath265 luminosity .    in order to estimate the improvement obtained by using the exact luminosities",
    "as compared to former simpler approaches , we show in the following series of figures ratios of the exact results and the convolutions of the exact single - vector - boson distributions from @xcite as well as their lla versions . the ratio of the convolutions ( [ conv ] ) and the exact luminosities is shown in fig . 4 for a @xmath259 pair in a @xmath164 tev @xmath0 pair .",
    "the discrepancy grows with decreasing @xmath155 and is largest for transverse polarizations in which case it reaches a factor of @xmath266 at @xmath267 . at higher energies",
    "the agreement between the two versions is better as seen in fig .  5 where the same ratio is shown for a value @xmath268 tev , which is a typical @xmath269 sub - process energy in @xmath270 collisions at @xmath271 tev .",

    "we note that the disagreement at @xmath274 would have been larger if we had used @xmath9 instead of @xmath249 in the argument of the logarithms .",
    "we also present some results relevant for a @xmath275 gev @xmath0 collider .",

    "the luminosities reach their highest value not far from threshold .",
    "the behavior of the different polarizations with varying @xmath155 is as described for the @xmath164 tev case .",
    "there is a resemblance between the pairs @xmath265 , @xmath111 and @xmath278 , @xmath279 . in both cases ,",
    "the luminosity proportional to the product of vector and axial - vector coupling is smaller than its partner at low @xmath155 but then joins it at high @xmath155 .",
    "finally , figs .",
    "9 and 10 show the luminosities for a @xmath280 pair .",
    "the major changes as compared to the @xmath259 case are due to the change in the vector - boson couplings , while the changes due to the different vector - boson masses are small .",
    "the @xmath280 luminosities are more than an order of magnitude smaller than the @xmath259 luminosities . owing to the small vector coupling of the @xmath2 , the luminosities which are proportional to the product of vector and axial - vector coupling are negligible .    in summary ,",
    "only the luminosities for longitudinally polarized vector boson pairs in regions of high @xmath281 and @xmath155 might be described by the convolutions or the lla . for luminosities involving transverse polarizations ,",
    "neither of these two approximations reproduces the exact calculations with a reasonable accuracy . the disagreement becomes worse with decreasing @xmath155 and decreasing @xmath281 .    to obtain luminosities relevant for deep - inelastic lepton nucleon scattering or for processes at hadron colliders , one would have to adjust the factors in ( [ lumis3 ] ) containing the vector and axial - vector coupling constants and , in addition , to fold the luminosities with quark distribution functions .",
    "this would result in luminosities for vector - boson pairs in an @xmath282 , @xmath270 or @xmath283 initial state .",
    "we have derived exact distribution functions for a pair of vector bosons inside a pair of fermions .",
    "in contrast to previously used approximations , our distributions take into account the mutual influence of the emission of one boson on the emission of the other .",
    "the commonly used leading logarithmic approximation and a convolution of exact distribution functions for single vector bosons inside fermions are obtained if one neglects regions in phase space in which the virtual vector bosons have four - momenta squared much larger than their squared masses .",
    "we have shown that for transverse polarizations of the vector bosons , these approximations do not reproduce the exact calculation with a reasonable accuracy .    our results are obtained from an exact calculation of a subset of feynman diagrams without the need to introduce any approximation except specific assumptions for the off - shell behaviour of vector - boson scattering cross sections . a different off - shell behaviour could be taken into account in our formalism without additional complications .",
    "of course , in order to obtain complete predictions for cross sections of vector - boson production in @xmath0 or hadron colliders , one would have to add contributions from feynman diagrams which are not of the type as shown in fig .  1 , as for example @xmath269 annihilation or bremsstrahlung processes .",
    "these additional contributions might become particularly important at smaller energies .",
    "finally one should note that we did not attempt to take into account any kind of experimental cuts on kinematical variables for final state particles , like transverse momenta or rapidities .",
    "these cuts would , first of all , enter in the expressions for the vector - boson scattering cross sections .",
    "as far as experimental cuts on final state momenta imply restrictions also for the momentum transfers @xmath137 , or the scale variable @xmath155 , it would be straightforward to modify our expressions for the luminosities accordingly .",
    "the four - momenta in the center - of - mass system @xmath55 of @xmath60 and @xmath61 are @xmath284 with @xmath285 and @xmath286 . for simplicity , we assume that the final state @xmath22 produced via the 2-boson process allows to specify the @xmath155- and @xmath287-axes of a coordinate system .",
    "if the state @xmath22 decays into @xmath40 particles with momenta @xmath288 , we choose this system such that the @xmath287-component of one specific four - momentum , say @xmath289 , of the set of @xmath288 vanishes and its @xmath155-component is non - negative .",

    "the overall azimuth of the system is defined by choosing the @xmath287-component of @xmath296 to be zero and its @xmath155-component non - negative , so that @xmath297 with @xmath298 and @xmath299 .",
