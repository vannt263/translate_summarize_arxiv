    "given a radon measure @xmath5 on @xmath6 and a continuously differentiable kernel @xmath7 that satisfies the antisymmetry condition @xmath8the singular integral operator @xmath9 associated with @xmath10 and @xmath5 is formally given by @xmath11 notice that the above integral does not usually exist when @xmath12 .",
    "the truncated singular integral operators @xmath13 , @xmath14 ; @xmath15 are considered in order to overcome this obstacle . in the same vein",
    "one considers the maximal operator @xmath16 @xmath17 and the principal values of @xmath18 at every @xmath19 which , if they exist , are given by @xmath20 the singular integral operator @xmath9 associated with @xmath5 and @xmath10 is said to be bounded in @xmath21 if there exists some constant @xmath22 such that for @xmath23 and @xmath14 @xmath24    the natural question as to whether the @xmath21-boundedness of the operator @xmath9 forces its principal values to exist @xmath5 almost everywhere has been considered in many papers ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . even when @xmath5 is an @xmath25-dimensional ahlfors - david ( ad ) regular measure in @xmath6 :",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath10 is any of the coordinate riesz kernels : @xmath27 the question remains open for @xmath28 .",
    "when @xmath29 , or equivalently in the case of the cauchy transform , the above question has a positive answer by the results of mattila , melnikov and verdera ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "later on , in @xcite , tolsa improved the afore mentioned results by removing the ahlfors - david regularity assumption .    in different settings the answer to the above question can be negative .",
    "let @xmath30 be the 1-dimensional four corners cantor set and @xmath5 its natural ( 1-dimensional hausdorff ) measure .",
    "david in @xcite , constructed caldern - zygmund standard , or simply cz standard , kernels that define operators bounded in @xmath21 whose principal values fail to exist @xmath5 almost everywhere .",
    "although david s kernels can be chosen odd or even are not homogeneous of degree -1 .",
    "in this note we consider classical plane sierpinski gaskets of hausdorff dimension @xmath0 , @xmath31 .",
    "for each of these @xmath0-ad regular sets @xmath2 , we find families of cz standard , smooth , and antisymmetric kernels of the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 is some increasing @xmath34 function satisfying the homogeneity condition @xmath35 for @xmath36 and @xmath37 is odd on the unit circle @xmath38 .",
    "if @xmath4 is the restriction of the @xmath0-dimensional hausdorff measure on @xmath2 , these kernels define singular integral operators bounded in @xmath3 whose principal values diverge @xmath39 almost everywhere . the proof is based on the @xmath40-theorem of david and journ , proved in @xcite , and the symmetry properties of sierpinski gaskets allowing heavy cancelations .    unfortunately if in the above kernels we replace the function @xmath41 by @xmath42 , where in this case the kernels would be @xmath0-homogeneous in the classical sense",
    ", we can not say if the corresponding operators are bounded ( or not ) in @xmath43 .",
    "however their principal values diverge @xmath39 almost everywhere , as the proof of section 4 goes through with no changes .",
    "modified slightly , the proof can be applied to many other symmetric self similar sets , e.g. the four corners cantor sets with hausdorff dimension less than @xmath44 or the self similar sets discussed in @xcite .",
    "the dimensional restriction is essential for the proof and it is not known to us if there exist cz standard kernels , of the same form as in ( [ ke ] ) , satisfying the homogeneity condition @xmath45 , that define singular integral operators bounded in @xmath43 but whose principal values diverge almost everywhere .",
    "let @xmath46 and consider the following three similitudes ( depending on @xmath47 ) @xmath48    * @xmath49 * @xmath50 * @xmath51    let @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the set @xmath54 can be partially ordered in the following way , for @xmath55 , @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes the restriction of @xmath58 in its first @xmath59 coordinates . for @xmath60 ,",

    "denote @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the limit set of the iteration @xmath70 is self similar and in fact it is an @xmath71-sierpinski triangle with hausdorff dimension @xmath72 notice that for @xmath46 , @xmath73 . as a general property of self",
    "similar sets the measures @xmath74 @xmath75 are @xmath76-ad regular .",
    "hence there exists a constant @xmath77 , depending only on @xmath47 , such that for @xmath78 and @xmath79 , @xmath80    the spaces @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the usual euclidean metric , are simple examples of spaces of homogeneous type ( see @xcite for definition ) .",
    "we want to find caldern - zygmund standard kernels on @xmath83 that define bounded singular integral operators on @xmath84 . in that direction , for @xmath46 , we need to define two auxiliary families of functions .    _ the functions @xmath85 _ : for",

    "therefore @xmath139 for some @xmath140 , @xmath141 .",
    "this implies that , @xmath142 since @xmath143 we get @xmath144 as @xmath145 and @xmath146 we deduce that @xmath147 and @xmath148 therefore as @xmath149 and @xmath150@xmath151 for some @xmath152 . from ( [ 1 ] ) ,",
    "( [ 2 ] ) , ( [ 3 ] ) and the definition of @xmath153 and @xmath154 we deduce that @xmath155 and @xmath156 hence @xmath157 and by antisymmetry @xmath158 it follows that the kernels @xmath159 are cz standard , in fact condition ( [ k2 ] ) is much stronger than the ones appearing in the usual definitions of cz standard kernels ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "as stated before , we want to show that the kernels define singular integral operators that are bounded in @xmath160 , and examine their convergence properties .",
    "for all @xmath46 the maximal singular integral operators @xmath162 , @xmath163 are bounded in @xmath160 .",
    "the idea is to use the @xmath40 theorem of david and journ in the context of @xcite .",

    ": let @xmath170 for some @xmath171 .",
    "if @xmath172 , @xmath173 , we get @xmath174 furthermore there exists some @xmath152 such that for @xmath175 @xmath176 , @xmath177 and for @xmath175 @xmath178 , @xmath179 hence @xmath180 but for @xmath181  we have that @xmath182 @xmath183 and consequently @xmath184 .",

    "as @xmath186 for all @xmath196 the same holds for their transposes .    due to the structure of the spaces @xmath197 the proof of the @xmath40 theorem in this setting is essentially the same with the one appearing in @xcite .",
    "as commented in @xcite and in @xcite , in order to be able to use the @xmath40 theorem we need some suitable decomposition of dyadic type , as in @xcite and @xcite , to replace the usual dyadic cubes in @xmath6 . in our setting the required such family @xmath198",
    "consists of all the triangles appearing in every step of the iteration process , i.e. @xmath199 and @xmath200 in the assumptions of the original david - journ @xmath40 theorem the operators should also satisfy an extra condition the so called weak boundedness .",
    "this condition is only used in the proof , as it appears in @xcite , to show that there exists some absolute constant @xmath30 , such that for all dyadic cubes @xmath201 @xmath202 but since the operators @xmath164 are canonically associated with antisymmetric kernels the weak boundedness comes for free , see e.g. @xcite .    applying the @xmath40 theorem",
    "we derive that every element of the sequence @xmath203 is bounded in @xmath204 with bounds not depending on @xmath59 .",
    "this fact enables us to extract some linear @xmath160-bounded operator @xmath9 as a weak limit of some subsequence of @xmath205 . finally using the version of cotlar s inequality , as it is stated in ( @xcite , p.59 )",
    ", we get that there exists some constant @xmath30 such that for all @xmath206 @xmath207 where @xmath208 is the hardy - littlewood maximal operator related to the measure @xmath209 .",
    "therefore we conclude that @xmath210 is bounded in @xmath211 .",
    "let @xmath46 . for @xmath212 almost every point in @xmath213 the principal values of the singular integral operator",
    "@xmath214 do not exist .      to every @xmath217 assign naturally the code @xmath218 such that @xmath219 and consider the set @xmath220 the set @xmath221 had full @xmath222 measure as its complement @xmath223 is countable .",
    "in fact the set @xmath223 consists of the vertices of every triangle @xmath224 , @xmath225 .",
    "notice that there exist some @xmath226 and some @xmath227 such that for every @xmath228 and every @xmath229 , satisfying @xmath230 , there exist @xmath231 and positive numbers @xmath232 with the properties ,        to see this , let some @xmath239 and denote @xmath240 . for all @xmath241 , @xmath242 for all @xmath243 and @xmath244 , where @xmath245 , @xmath246 and @xmath247 where @xmath248 or @xmath249 .",
