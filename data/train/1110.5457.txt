    "many interesting swelling and shrinking phenomena are observed when a porous medium deforms as a consequence of the variation of the fluid mass content .",
    "the behavior of the system can be controlled via different external parameters , e.g.  the fluid chemical potential  @xcite or a mechanical pressure exerted on the solid component @xcite .    by focusing the attention on this last class of phenomena",
    "we are led to consider the so  called consolidation problem . despite the existence of classical and well known theories @xcite , the dilatant / contractant behavior of porous solids needs , however , deeper investigation .",
    "we refer , in particular , to undrained conditions , i.e. , to the case in which the loading rate does not allow pore  water pressure dissipation . in these conditions ,",
    "the coupling between shearing and dilatancy typically induces the formation of strain localization bands .",
    "in particular shear bands with transeverse size depending on the texture and the constitutive properties of the material , see e.g. @xcite , are seen .",
    "for instance , in simple shear test , densely or loosely packed granular media exhibit dilatancy or compaction behavior .",
    "moreover due to porosity change , the fluid can migrate through the pores and eventually remain segregated , possibly enhancing localised overpressurization and fluidization of the soil , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "local dilatancy is typically modeled in the framework of ( poro)plasticity by assuming that irreversible deformations take place inside the porous medium , see e.g. the general treatises @xcite .",
    "special important applications to multi  phase porous media and geomaterials have been considered in the recent literature @xcite by approaching plasticity with strain gradient @xcite or multi  scale analysis @xcite .    in the papers @xcite",
    "we have attacked this problem from the point of view of bifurcation theory and we have shown that it is possible to describe interesting phenomena ( still in the range of non  linear elasticity ) taking place when the pressure exerted on the solid exceeds a suitable limiting value .",
    "more precisely , we have proven that enhanced models based on gradient elasticity allow for describing the transition between phases of the porous medium associated with different fluid content , say a fluid  rich and a fluid  poor phase .",
    "in other words the theory proposed in those papers is able to describe the occurrence of segregation and local overpressurization of the pore  water , see the above quoted references for more details .",
    "experiments demonstrate that the presence of a pressurized fluid ",
    "rich phase at the base of a layered granular material can give rise to an unstable ( with respect to possible fluidization ) configuration of the system @xcite .",
    "this result is achieved in laboratory , see @xcite , considering a fluidized column test setup where a fluid is forced to flow through a saturated sample from the bottom . by tuning the velocity of the fluid , the drag force acting on the solid grains , and hence the possible unbalance of gravity ,",
    "is controlled @xcite .",
    "the model in @xcite is able to explain the formation of fluid  rich regions inside a porous material via a sort of segregation process , due to different initial data and parametrized by the pressure applied to the solid ; note that the control parameter in the experiment quoted above is , instead , the velocity of the injected fluid .",
    "different dissipation mechanisms , driven by the microstructural properties of the material , give rise to different deformation paths and fluid mass content evolutions .    in this paper we show that , depending on the dissipative mechanism which is taken into account , the evolution is described either by an allen  cahn or by a cahn  hilliard  like system of partial differential equations , which indeed play an important role in the theory of phase ordering dynamics  @xcite .",
    "when a system is quenched from the homogeneous phase into a broken  symmetry one , think to a ferromagnet or to a gas abruptly cooled below their critical temperature , the two phases have to separate and order has to increase throughout the system via domain coarsening .",
    "this phenomenon can be described via a field @xmath0 on the physical space @xmath1 , with @xmath2 the physical dimension , having the proper physical interpretation , for instance local magnetization in ferromagnets , density in liquid  vapor systems , and concentration in alloys .",
    "a possible model for the evolution of this field is the allen  cahn equation @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a positive constant and @xmath5 a double well regular function .",
    "the allen  cahn equation , also called the time ",
    "dependent ginzburg ",
    "landau equation , was introduced in @xcite to describe the motion of anti  phase boundaries in crystalline solids . in this context",
    "@xmath0 represents the concentration of one of the two components of the alloy and the parameter @xmath6 the interface width .",
    "the allen  cahn equation is not suited to describe phase separation when the order parameter is conserved , namely , when the integral of the field @xmath0 on the whole space @xmath7 is constant . on the other hand this is possible in the framework of the cahn  hilliard equation @xmath8 by assuming @xmath9 on @xmath10 , that is by requiring the derivative of @xmath0 and that of the laplacian of @xmath0 orthogonal to the boundary to vanish on the boundary @xmath10 itself .",
    "the cahn  hilliard equation was firstly introduced to describe spinodal decomposition in alloys  @xcite .    a straightforward way to derive the allen  cahn and the cahn ",
    "hilliard equations is that of assuming the evolution of the field @xmath0 to be governed by a gradient equation @xcite @xmath11 associated with the landau energy functional @xmath12{{\\textrm{d}}}x\\ ] ] the functional above has a clear physical interpretation : the term @xmath13 has two minima corresponding to the two phases , while the gradient  squared term associates an energy cost with an interface between the two phases .",
    "if no constraint to the total value of the order parameter is imposed , it is possible to compute the gradient of the landau functional in the hilbert space @xmath14 to get the allen  cahn equation .",
    "when the integral of the field @xmath0 is assumed to be constant throughout the evolution , computing the gradient in the @xmath14 results into a non  local evolution equation , while by using the hilbert space @xmath15 the cahn  hilliard equation is found .",
    "the above described approach is general and applies to any physical interpretation of the two equations . when the discussion is bounded to particular physical systems , phenomenological approaches",
    "can also be used requiring the a priori specification of the constitutive equations .",
    "the related physical literature is huge and , among others , we refer to @xcite . in the context of binary fluids , for example",
    ", @xmath0 is the fluid concentration .",
    "assume the continuity equation in the form @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the fluid current prescribed in terms of the chemical potential @xmath18 by fick s law @xmath19 , with @xmath20 a positive constant . by letting @xmath18",
    "be the functional derivative of @xmath21 , one gets @xmath22 which is the cahn  hilliard equation .",
    "in our problem the allen  cahn and the cahn  hilliard ",
    "like equations appear in a completely natural way by using the variational description of continuum mechanics . by following  @xcite",
    "we describe the porous material via two fields , the _ strain _ @xmath4 and the _ fluid density _ ( measured with respect to the solid reference volume ) @xmath23 .",
    "we then assume that the possible motions of the system are those such that the variation of the action equals the opposite of the time integral of the virtual work of the dissipative forces corresponding to the variation of the fields . solving the variational problem",
    "we get the equations of motion .",
    "the explicit form of the equations of motion depends not only on the form of the action but also on the way in which the dissipation phenomenon is modeled  @xcite . assuming the potential energy to be quadratic in the first derivatives of the strain and of the fluid density , the evolution is described by an allen  cahn  like equation for the field @xmath23 provided that dissipative forces are assumed to be proportional to the second derivative of the velocity of the fluid .",
    "we refer to this assumption as to the stokes dissipation . on the other hand , we find that the evolution is described by a cahn  hilliard  like equation for the field @xmath23 provided dissipation is modeled via the darcy law , namely , the dissipative forces are proportional to the velocity of the fluid .",
    "it is possible to give a nice physical interpretation to the fact that the evolution is described by the allen  cahn or the cahn  hilliard  like equations depending on the way in which dissipation is put into the game . with homogenization arguments",
    "it has been proven that when the characteristic length at the local @xmath24 and at the macroscopic @xmath25 scales separate , say @xmath26 , then the resistance experienced by the fluid when flowing through the porous material can be described by the darcy law . on the other hand when the separation of scales is poor , the darcy limit unfairly approximates the flow , since the macroscopic characteristic length is of the same order of magnitude as the pore characteristic size @xcite . in other words in this case",
    "the solid grains have to be considered as microporous themselves .",
    "moreover , we note that the steady stokes equations , which describe the behavior of the fluid at the microscopic level , can be upscaled to a set of equations describing a non  stokesian flow only if the size of the solid obstacles to the fluid motion have a critical size with respect to the inter ",
    "obstacle distance , see for more details ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  3.1 ) . this condition",
    "provide the so  called brinkman limit .",
    "conversely when the ostables are too small the homogenized equations coincide with the stokes equations . thus the allen  cahn  like equations , which correspond to a purely stokesian flow , are controlled by the viscosity of the fluid ; on the other hand the cahn  hilliard  like equations , which correspond to a darcy flow , are controlled by the permeability of the solid skeleton .",
    "in particular the cahn  hilliard ",
    "like model reads , within the framework of soil consolidation theory , as a generalization to strain gradient materials of the one  dimensional terzaghi problem , see @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first introduce the model in section  [ s : model ] . in section  [ s : lin ]",
    "we assume small variations of the fields with respect to some reference values , and we find the allen - cahn and cahn  hilliard  like equations . in section  [ s : risultati ]",
    "we consider a special model allowing to describe solid  fluid segregation in consolidation  @xcite and we give a numerical study of the equations deduced in the previous sections .",
    "in this section we introduce the one dimensional poromechanical model whose geometrically linearized version will be studied in the following sections .",
    "kinematics will be briefly resumed starting from the general statement of the model @xcite together with some particular issue introduced in @xcite .",
    "the equations governing the behavior of the porous system will then be deduced prescribing the conservative part of the constitutive law through a suitable potential energy density @xmath27 and the dissipative contributions through purely stokes or darcy terms .",
    "special emphasis will be given to the boundary conditions and the extended definition of the essential and the natural ones will be discussed .",

    "the _ solid placement _",
    "@xmath31 is a @xmath32 function such that the map @xmath33 , associating to each @xmath34 the position occupied at time @xmath35 by the particle labeled by @xmath36 in the reference configuration @xmath37 , is a @xmath32diffeomorphism . the _ fluid placement _",

    "the three fields @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are not at all independent ; indeed , by definition , we immediately have that @xmath46 for any @xmath34 and @xmath47 .    in the sequel",
    "we shall often use the inverse functions of the space sections of the field @xmath44 , @xmath43 , and @xmath45 .",
    "we shall misuse the notation and let @xmath48 be the inverse of the map @xmath49 at a given time @xmath35 .",

    "one can arbitrarily choose two among the three fields @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "since the reference configuration @xmath37 of the solid component is know a priori , a good choice appears to be that of expressing all the dynamical observables in terms of the fields @xmath43 and @xmath45 which are defined on @xmath37 .",

    "sufficiency we shall report the computation in detail for the one  dimensional case .",
    "it is natural to assume that , if the system is acted upon only by conservative forces , its dynamics is described by a _",

    "the discussion has been conducted along very general lines . in the following sections we shall specify first the form of the virtual work of the drag forces and then that of the action .",
    "we shall obtain , finally , an explicit representation of the equations of motion ( see ( [ em06 ] ) and ( [ em06bc ] ) ) with suitable boundary conditions .      the way in which dissipation has to be introduced in saturated porous media models is still under debate , see for instance @xcite .",
    "in particular according to the effectiveness of the hypothesis of separation of scales , between the local and macroscopic level , darcy s or stokes effects are accounted for .",
    "we first consider the so ",
    "called darcy effect , i.e. , the dissipation due to forces proportional to the velocity of the fluid component measured with respect to the solid . by following phenomenological arguments @xcite or by developing suitable homogenization schemes",
    "it is seen that the fluid flow is , in this case , controlled by the permeability of the porous material .",
    "a natural expression for the virtual work of the dissipation forces acting on the fluid component and taking into account the darcy effect is @xmath84   [ \\delta\\chi_{{\\textrm{f}}}(\\chi^{-1}_{{\\textrm{f}}}(x , t),t )   -   \\delta\\chi_{{\\textrm{s}}}(\\chi^{-1}_{{\\textrm{s}}}(x , t),t ) ] \\,{{\\textrm{d}}}x\\ ] ] where @xmath85 is a constant proportional to the inverse of permeability and @xmath86 is the variation of the field @xmath44 induced by the independent variations @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the quantity @xmath87 $ ] is the dissipative force density ( relative to the current configuration space volume ) which depends on the kinematic fields only through the velocity of the fluid component relative to the solid .",
    "apparently equation ( [ lv01 ] ) for the virtual work of darcy dissipative forces is consistent with the classical expression of darcy dissipation associated with the viscous flow through a porous continuum , see @xcite .    following the recipe described above we have to express the virtual work in terms of the field @xmath43 and @xmath45 .",
    "we first remark  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix c ) that @xmath88 for any @xmath34 and @xmath47 . moreover , noted that @xmath89 , by using the definition of the eulerian velocities , from ( [ vf ] ) we get @xmath90 in order to get an expression of the virtual work comparable to that of the action , we have to rewrite the integral as an integral extended to the solid reference configuration .",
    "given @xmath35 , by performing the change of variables @xmath91 in the integral in ( [ lv01 ] ) and by using equations ( [ sv02 ] ) and ( [ lv05 ] ) we get @xmath92    for the virtual work of the drag forces it is often considered also the contribution of the stokes effect  @xcite , namely , the virtual work of dissipative forces controlled by the second derivative of the velocity of the fluid component relative to the solid .",
    "this contribution is typically the leading term in the case when separation of scales between the local and the macroscopic level is no more valid . in these cases",
    "dissipative stresses must be taken into account at macroscopic level too @xcite and , thus , the second derivative of the fluid velocity appears in the governing equations . a naive choice for the virtual work of the dissipation forces would be @xmath93 ''    \\ ,   [ \\delta\\chi_{{\\textrm{f}}}(\\chi^{-1}_{{\\textrm{f}}}(x , t),t )   -   \\delta\\chi_{{\\textrm{s}}}(\\chi^{-1}_{{\\textrm{s}}}(x , t),t ) ] \\,{{\\textrm{d}}}x\\ ] ] with @xmath94 a positive constant ;",
    "note that the second derivative is taken with respect to the space variable @xmath58 in the current configuration @xmath95 .",
    "following the same thermodynamic argument as that developed for darcy dissipation , to the expression above of the virtual work corresponds the effective power @xmath96 ''    \\ ,   [ v_{{\\textrm{f}}}(x , t)-v_{{\\textrm{s}}}(x , t ) ] \\,{{\\textrm{d}}}x\\ ] ] since it is not negative definite , the proposed expression of the virtual work is not physically acceptable .",
    "this problem has been nicely solved in  @xcite where the following expression of the virtual work @xmath97 '    \\ ,    [ \\delta\\chi_{{\\textrm{f}}}(\\chi^{-1}_{{\\textrm{f}}}(x , t),t )   -   \\delta\\chi_{{\\textrm{s}}}(\\chi^{-1}_{{\\textrm{s}}}(x , t),t ) ] ' \\,{{\\textrm{d}}}x\\ ] ] with @xmath98 , has been proposed .",
    "equation ( [ lv10 ] ) for the virtual work of dissipative forces is indeed definitely consistent with the expression of the fluid dissipation when the fluid velocity satisfies the navier  stokes equations .",
    "as a matter of facts replacing the virtual displacement with velocities in the above expression yields the effective power of the stokes drag forces which results to be negative definite .",
    "note that , by performing an integration by part of ( [ lv10 ] ) , a term similar to ( [ lv12 ] ) is found plus a contribution on the boundary of the actual domain .",
    "we rewrite , now , the expression of the stokes virtual work as we have done for the darcy contribution and we shall find an equation similar to ( [ lv02 ] ) .",
    "in other words we shall express all the functions appearing in ( [ lv10 ] ) in terms of the fields @xmath43 and @xmath45 and , via the changing of variable @xmath91 for any fixed @xmath35 , extend the integral to the domain @xmath37 .",
    "the computation is performed in the [ s : bold ] ; the result is @xmath99\\,{{\\textrm{d}}}x_{{\\textrm{s}}}\\ ] ] where we have omitted , for simplicity , to write explicitly that all the functions are evaluated in @xmath100 . from ( [ lv02 ] ) and ( [ lv16 ] ) we finally have the following expression for the virtual work of the drag forces obtained by taking into account both the darcy and the stokes effects @xmath101 where we have set @xmath102 and @xmath103    since we need an expression of the virtual work in terms of the variations @xmath80 and @xmath81 of the basic fields , we integrate ( [ lv18 ] ) by parts and get @xmath104 as already noticed only in the brinkman limit darcy and stokes dissipative effects",
    "can be accounted for together ; on the other hand , in the general case , they are treated separately .",
    "this is indeed what we shall do in section [ s : lin ] .      in order to write explicitly the variation of the action we specify , now , the form of the lagrangian density . in the sequel we shall not consider the inertial effects , so that , the lagrangian density will be the opposite of the potential energy density associated to both the internal and external conservative forces . as it has been shown in  @xcite ( see equation  ( 18 ) therein )",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the potential energy density depends on the space and time variable only via two physically relevant functions : the strain of the solid and a properly normalized fluid mass density  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , consider the jacobian @xmath105 of the solid placement map , which measures the ratio between current and reference volumes of the solid component , and let @xmath106/2\\ ] ] be the _",

    ", i.e. , @xmath200 , in @xcite we could prove the existence of a connection , but we were not able to find it explicitly . studying in more detail the behavior of the solutions of the system ( [ problema - staz00 ] ) is a difficult task since , in this case , the problem can not be rewritten as a one dimensional conservative mechanical system .",
    "we shall then study the behavior of the solutions close to the two phases by linearizing the stationary equations , while far from the points representing the phases we shall use a finite difference numerical approach .",
    "the first question that naturally arises looking at the solutions obtained in the degenerate case , see figure  [ f : staz01 ] , is the nature of the bump . in the degenerate case",
    "the bump is due to the fact that the solution of the stationary problem , once projected onto the @xmath23@xmath4 plane , has to lie on the constraint curve , so that its shape depends on that of the constraint itself . in the not degenerate case no constraint curve exists , in other words",
    "it does not exist any a priori privileged manifold on the plane @xmath23@xmath4 .",
    "it is then possible ( in principle ) that the bump is associated to solutions oscillating close to the phases .    in order to discuss the existence of such oscillatory solutions we linearize the problem close to the phases .",
    "let @xmath250 be one of the two points @xmath218 and @xmath219 representing , respectively , the standard and the fluid  rich phase .",
    "by expanding the first gradient part of the stationary equations ( [ problema - staz ] ) around @xmath250 to the first order , we get the linearized equations @xmath251 if we let @xmath252 and @xmath253 , the above equations become @xmath254 where we consider the column vector @xmath255 and set @xmath256 note that the matrix @xmath257 is trivially real and symmetric ; moreover , in the not degenerate case @xmath200 it is also positive definite .",
    "the matrix @xmath258 , on the other hand , is real and , by schwartz theorem , symmetric .",
    "moreover , as we proved in @xcite , it is positive definite at any pressure greater than the critical one @xmath171 ; in particular it is positive definite at the coexistence pressure .    looking for solutions of ( [ lin01 ] ) in the form @xmath259 , with @xmath260 and @xmath261",
    ", we get that the constant vector @xmath262 has to be a solution of @xmath263 .",
    "set @xmath264 ; in order to have not vanishing @xmath262 solving the above equation , @xmath18 has to be a solution of the secular equation @xmath265 .",
    "since @xmath257 is real , symmetric , and positive definite and @xmath258 is real and symmetric , it follows that the solutions @xmath266 and @xmath267 of the secular equations are real .",
    "moreover , since @xmath258 is positive definite we have that those solutions are positive themselves ( see , for instance , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  40 , chapter  6 ) ) .",
    "thus the secular equations have four real pairwise opposite eigenvalues .",
    "this implies that the two fixed points are unstable , as it also follows from the existence of the connection , and that no oscillation around the fixed points is expected .",

    "cahn  like set of partial differential equations is affected by initial conditions during a characteristic time interval much larger than the corresponding one typical of the cahn  hilliard  like equations , see figures  [ f : acdin01]@xmath262 and [ f : chdin01]@xmath262 , which correspond to the formation of the drop - like shape of the profile .",
    "it is worth to notice that both the allen  cahn and the cahn ",
    "hilliard evolution processes separately exhibit a consistent behavior when the initial data is changed . in particular , starting from spatially random or stratified initial conditions , both equations provide , after a transitory regime , a quasi  static evolution of an interface  like profile which nucleates and propagates at the same time and with the same velocity . on the other hand",
    "the numerical simulations suggest that the quasi ",
    "static evolution process starts at different characteristic times and develops with different velocities when the darcy and stokes dissipation mechanisms are considered .    as already mentioned these two mechanisms correspond respectively to the presence ( darcy & cahn  hilliard regime ) or absence ( stokes & allen  cahn regime ) of scale separation and , thus , to the cases in which the fluid dissipative flow is parametrised either by the permeability of the solid or by the viscosity of the fluid .",
    "in these two situations the micro  structure of the corresponding porous media is quite different : materials with scale separation are constituted by solid grains which do not hinder the fluid flow strongly ; the grains can be regarded as undeformable and impermeable , suffering an equivalent drag force due to the average fluid velocity . on the other hand materials with no scale separation",
    "are micro  porous and the fluid flow is much more hindered by the micro  structure of the skeleton .",
    "this could provide a possible explanation for the very high discrepancy between the characteristic times of evolution for the cahn  hilliard and the allen ",
    "cahn  like system of equation : when dealing with a cahn  hilliard dissipative process the time necessary to approach the stationary state is lower than that necessary to reach the same state through an allen  cahn evolution , see figures   [ f : acdin04 ] , [ f : acdin06 ] , [ f : chdin04 ] , and  [ f : chdin06 ] .    comparing the distance between the current and the stationary strain energy for the cahn  hilliard and allen  cahn evolution process",
    ", three or two different regimes can be appreciated .",
    "these indeed correspond to the smearing out of the random oscillation ( if any ) , to the formation of the intermediate drop  like solution , and tothe nucleation of the interface  like profile .",
    "deeper investigations will be developed in the future in order to better explain such phenomenon , also accounting for different boundary conditions .",
