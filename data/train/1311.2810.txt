    "the implications of this macromolecular crowding on the characteristics of diffusing particles of various sizes are still under debate @xcite .",
    "another source impeding the free diffusion of particles in eukaryotic cells stems from a network of cytoskeletal filaments and internal membranes like the endoplasmic reticulum or the nuclear membrane .",
    "such forms of crowding impair the particle diffusivity inside a cell and may alter the law of diffusion altogether , from brownian motion to a subdiffusive law . in the latter case ,",
    "the mean squared displacement ( msd ) scales as @xcite @xmath1 with the anomalous diffusion exponent @xmath2 .",
    "experimental data are available , inter alia , for the in vivo subdiffusion of proteins @xcite and enzymes @xcite , endogenous submicron particles ( lipid and insulin granules ) @xcite , viral particles @xcite , fluorescently labelled gold particles @xcite , messenger rna molecules @xcite , as well as the telomeres of chromosomes @xcite . in vitro ,",
    "dense solutions of coil - like polymers , proteins , or worm - like micelles often mimic the effects of molecular crowding which depend on the particle size , the solution viscosity , and the effective medium porosity @xcite . similarly , in large scale computer simulations of crowded lipid membranes , subdiffusion is observed for various membrane chemistries @xcite .",
    "measuring the apparent _ local _ diffusivity of smaller proteins in bacterial @xcite and eukaryotic @xcite cells reveals a nontrivial dependence on the position in the cell .",
    "one reason for this spatial variation of the diffusivity may be the cells geometrical shape @xcite .",
    "thus , certain cell types possess a ` fried egg - shape ' ( fig .  [ fig - diff - lang ] ) with a significant variation of the cell thickness from the periphery towards the nucleus",
    ". a higher apparent abundance of proteins in the cytosol near the nucleus , interpreted as a higher cytoplasm diffusivity , may simply originate due to the 2d imaging of the fully 3d particle trajectories .",
    "away from the thicker perinuclear region , the cell periphery offers only a thin , nearly 2d domain for the particle diffusion .",
    "another source for the variations of the local diffusivity is the heterogeneity of the density of the macromolecular crowding in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm , as well as of the dense cytoskeletal meshwork near the cell periphery , and the accumulation of large cellular organelles in a perinuclear region .",
    "how exactly this affects the porosity of the cytoplasm and the diffusivity of tracers of different sizes is not well established @xcite .",
    "specifically , substantial deviations from the stokes - einstein law for protein tracers of varying molecular weights ( mw ) diffusing in the _ e. coli _ cytoplasm were observed and the diffusivity shown to follow the scaling law @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "small tracer proteins apparently experience a higher porosity near the nucleus of mammalian cells @xcite , while the diffusion of larger proteins becomes progressively restricted @xcite .",
    "thus , from a biological perspective , a stochastic model with spatially - varying diffusivity may mimic the effects on the diffusion of tracer particles in the heterogeneous environment of the crowded cellular cytoplasm and will serve as an empirical description of secondary processes such as intracellular , diffusion - controlled reactions .",
    "we here study the physical properties of such a heterogenous diffusion process ( hdp ) .",

    "@xcite ; courtesy to jrg langowski.,width=302 ]    important clues come from viral particles , a major class of natural diffusers in the bacterial cytoplasm .",
    "after internalisation by receptor - driven endocytosis @xcite , viruses often recruit highly processive cellular motor proteins @xcite which ensure fast and efficient viral transport between the cell periphery and the nucleus , where the viral replication and assembly often occurs @xcite .",
    "the intra - cellular dynamics of viruses and their multi - step infection pathways , as monitored by single - particle tracking , exhibits some features of anomalous diffusion @xcite .",
    "for instance , the scaling exponent @xmath4 of the viral motion is shown to depend on the region of the cytoplasm in which the diffusion takes place .",
    "three different modes of transport for adeno - associated viruses @xcite were identified in living substrate - adhered hela cells @xcite .",
    "the first is brownian motion with @xmath4=1 albeit with a much smaller diffusion coefficient than in dilute aqueous solution .",
    "the second mode is that of subdiffusion with @xmath5 and with a broad apparent distribution of diffusivities .",
    "the third mode is that of motor - driven transport of viruses via quasi-1d persistent walks along microtubular filaments , mediated by molecular motors driven by energy from atp conversion . upon infection ,",
    "the ballistic , driven motion with @xmath4=2 yields an effective drift of virions towards the nucleus .",
    "these diffusion - based and active modes of viral transport can interchange .",
    "although the fraction of actively - transported virions is relatively small @xcite , this ` active pathway ' is often vital for a successful viral infection .",
    "small viruses can reach the nucleus solely by thermal diffusion , while larger virions have no chance but rely on the active transport mechanism . indeed , an accumulation of viruses near the nucleus was shown to be inhibited by microtubuli - depolymerising drugs ( e.g. , nocodazole ) that suppress motor - assisted virus transport @xcite .",
    "several recent models of intermittent transport @xcite were implemented to describe kinetics of viral infection , and search optimisation models with 2d versus 3d intermittent dynamics were developed @xcite .",
    "a number of diffusion @xcite , diffusion - reaction - advection @xcite , and kinetic transport @xcite models were suggested to rationalise the features of intracellular virus trafficking .",
    "in particular , the kinetics of spreading of a viral population starting at the cell membrane and the accompanying nucleus invasion times were computed @xcite and compared to typical time scales of viral infection recorded experimentally @xcite . in a series of theoretical and computer simulation studies holcman and colleagues",
    "@xcite modelled the process of viral trafficking as a sequence of alternating brownian 2d diffusive excursions and ballistic motor - powered propulsions along radially - ordered microtubuli filaments .",
    "the dynamical characteristics of viral invasion were computed in such a 2d planar pie - like model .",
    "the probability density function ( pdf ) and the mean time of nucleus invasion by viruses were evaluated @xcite .",
    "more advanced theoretical models can also include a rate of viral degradation in the cytoplasm @xcite , the kinetics of viral binding to microtubuli , and some bi - directionality of virus transport by the motors .",
    "here we consider the passive diffusion of tracer particles of sizes comparable to a virus capsid in a model cell . to construct our model",
    "we include the following information . from the viral trajectories reported in refs .",
    "@xcite we conclude that those particles exhibiting normal diffusion with @xmath6 take azimuthal journeys , at about constant separation from the cell nucleus .",
    "such propagation likely takes place in a region of roughly constant diffusivity . in contrast , that part of the viral population that diffuses anomalously mainly travels in the radial direction .",
    "we propose below that heterogeneities of the medium during the journey of a particle from the cell membrane to the nucleus gives rise to anomalous ( in particular , sub - diffusive ) features for this second population of particles .",
    "recently , extending previous studies @xcite we examined effects of position - dependent diffusivities on the ensemble and time averaged characteristics for 1d hdps @xcite .",
    "we tested several functional forms for @xmath7 ( power - law , logarithmic , and exponential ) to rationalise their implications onto diffusive and ergodic properties of the process . for power - law forms of @xmath8 we predicted from stochastic simulations and analytical calculations the regimes of sub- and super - diffusive behaviour .",
    "the conditions for weak ergodicity breaking were also analysed in details , an important feature when information from single particle tracking studies is evaluated in terms of time averages @xcite .",
    "the diffusion is non - ergodic in 1d due to the heterogeneities of the medium . in general , despite a non - brownian scaling of the msd , the time averaged msd was shown to follow a strictly linear growth with lag time .",
    "these features are similar to those for continuous time random walk processes @xcite .    for the 2d hpds examined below we also find non - ergodic behaviour .",
    "in addition , we compute a number of biologically relevant quantities such as the survival probability @xmath9 of particles in a circular domain for both diffusion from the inside of the cell to the outside and vice versa , the first - passage time dynamics for reaching the domain boundary , the pdf for the spreading of diffusing particles starting at the cell centre , at the cell boundary , and for initially uniformly - distributed walkers .",

    "we introduce the basic notations and the main quantities to be analysed .",
    "we outline the numerical scheme used in computations as well as the implemented theoretical concepts . in section [ sec - results ]",
    "we report the main simulations results and support them by asymptotic analytic calculations .",
    "we analyse the effects of the system heterogeneity and polar cell geometry on diffusive , kinetic , and ergodic properties of the hdp . in section [ sec - discussion ]",
    "the conclusions are drawn and possible applications of the results are discussed .",

    "[ fig - surv - prob - in].,width=264 ]      the survival probability for the diffusion from the outer boundary to the cell ` nucleus ' exhibits the exponential scaling @xmath129 in contrast to the @xmath130 law ( [ eq - surv - t12 ] ) for the opposite direction in the same domain .",
    "this exponential scaling is akin to the standard problem of 2d diffusion in a circular domain with a sink @xcite , see also ref .",
    "@xcite for the exponential scaling of @xmath9 in the 3d case .",
    "the characteristic time @xmath131 of the decrease of @xmath9 with time corresponds to the time the particles spend diffusing from the outer to the inner boundary in a medium with average diffusivity . as the radial diffusion is quasi-1d we can write @xmath132 for not too large @xmath133 values , when the medium diffusivity varies only moderately in the concentric shell , such an ansatz for @xmath131 works quite well .",
    "these asymptotes are shown as dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig - surv - prob - in ] , in comparison to the simulation results for @xmath9 .    similarly to the results for nucleus - to - membrane diffusion in fig .",
    "[ fig - arrival - out ] , we evaluate the distribution of the arrival times from the cell periphery to the nucleus of different sizes , compare fig .  [ fig - arrival - in ] .",
    "we studied the diffusion of particles in a 2d circular domain with a radially varying diffusivity @xmath0 .",
    "we showed that the resulting hdp is weakly non - ergodic in the sense that time and ensemble averages of physical quantities such as the msd behave differently .",
    "this effect was shown to depend on the initial conditions of the diffusive walkers .",
    "the diffusion in the direction of the diffusivity gradient was shown to be anomalous , while the azimuthal diffusion occurs in a nearly constant environment and is brownian .",
    "this behaviour is reminiscent of the radial and azimuthal diffusion of viral particles monitored in the bacterial cytoplasm , with purely radially varying diffusivity @xcite .",
    "specifically for the evaluation of single particle tracking data , our results for the non - ergodicity imply that ( i ) the time averages of physical quantities such as the msd behave differently from their ensemble analogues , and that ( ii ) individual time averages are not reproducible , i.e. , there occurs a major scatter in the amplitudes of these quantities . both need to be taken into account for a proper physical interpretation of data .",
    "we demonstrated that the diffusion from the domain centre to its boundary ( nucleus to membrane ) and the reverse process obey entirely different behaviours for the respective survival probabilities .",
    "namely , the @xmath134 scaling law was found for nucleus - membrane diffusion and the exponential @xmath135 decay was identified for membrane - nucleus diffusion .",
    "this latter fact as well as the spreading of particles according to these two scenarios can be rationalised in terms of a domain - averaged diffusion coefficient .    a quantitative understanding and the ability to tune viral diffusion in living cells has enormous potential as a tool to control and hopefully suppress the proliferation of infection .",
    "viral gene delivery carriers @xcite with a high transfection efficiency actively transported by motors @xcite are nowadays extensively used for gene delivery purposes .",
    "we note that our model may also be applied to macroscopic systems .",
    "thus , the spatial spreading of epidemics in a population of animals subject to non - homogeneous habital or foraging conditions is another possible area for application for our model .    in the present paper , we focused on the statistical and nonergodic properties of hdps in circular domains .",
    "a mathematical investigation of the process of viral infection in the presence of three inter - connected diffusion pathways ( anomalous diffusion , normal diffusion , and active directional transport ) is currently under way @xcite .",
