    "one of the most important and interesting predictions of quantum field theory is that the quantum vacuum state is not truly empty , but instead filled with virtual particles which are continuously created and annihilated due to the zero - point fluctuations @xcite . in quantum electrodynamics",
    "these fluctuations lead to a number of measurable effects in the realm of microscopic physics , such as the van der waals force between atoms in vacuum , natural widths of spectral lines , lamb shift , and anomalous magnetic moment of electron @xcite . in macroscopic level",
    ", the vacuum fluctuations manifest also themselves in a variety of observable mechanical phenomena and the archetype of them is the so - called static casimir effect @xcite .",
    "this effect which arises from the pressure that virtual photons exert on stationary boundaries , has been observed in different experiments @xcite and plays a very important role both in fundamental physics investigations as well as in understanding the basic limits of nanomechanical technologies @xcite .",
    "another manifestation of the zero - point fluctuations is the creation of real particles out of the vacuum induced by the interaction with dynamical external constraints @xcite . in this effect ,",
    "energy is transferred from the external field to the zero - point fluctuations transforming them into real particles .",
    "although a material boundary is somewhat analogous to an external constraint , there is no particle creation from the vacuum in the case of static boundaries ( static external constraints ) .",
    "however , if the boundaries are nonstationary , and the boundary conditions depend on time , there is particle creation from the vacuum in addition to the casimir force .",
    "such quantum vacuum amplification effect is commonly referred to as the dynamical casimir effect ( dce ) @xcite(for an extensive recent review , see @xcite ) .",
    "whereas the static casimir effect arises from a mismatch of vacuum modes in space , the dce originates from a mismatch of vacuum modes in time domain .",
    "examples of the dce range from cosmology , such as particle creation in a time - dependent cosmological background @xcite to cavity qed , such as photon generation in fabry - perot cavities with moving mirrors @xcite .",
    "there is an extensive literature on various aspects of the creation of photons due to the dce using various theoretical methods .",
    "for example , photon creation was described based on a hamiltonian approach @xcite .",
    "cavities with the insertion of dispersive mirrors or a slab with a time - dependent dielectric permittivity were considered @xcite .",
    "multiple - scale analysis was applied to the calculation of the flux of created particles @xcite .",
    "photon creation in a harmonically oscillating one - dimensional cavity with mixed boundary conditions has been analyzed @xcite .",
    "the dce has also been investigated in the context of cavity qed @xcite , in bose - einstein condensates @xcite , in excition - polariton condensates @xcite , in superconducting circuits@xcite , and in a quantum - well assisted optomechanical cavity @xcite . besides its intrinsic importance as a direct proof of the vacuum fluctuations ,",
    "various practical applications of the dce has been proposed , e.g. , for generation of photons with nonclassical properties @xcite , for high precision optical interferometry@xcite , for generation of atomic squeezed states @xcite , for multipartite entanglement generation in cavity networks@xcite , and for quantum communication protocols @xcite .    from the experimental point of view",
    ", the detection of the dce induced by moving boundaries is a serious problem .",
    "the main difficulty is largely due to the challenging prerequisite of generating appreciable mechanical frequencies of moving boundaries ( of the order of ghz ) to obtain a detectable number of photons .",
    "although there are some experimental proposals for the detection of the dce involving real mechanical motion of boundaries ( see for instance @xcite ) , several analogue systems have been proposed for observing the casimir radiation based on simulating moving boundaries by considering material bodies with time - dependent electromagnetic properties . the first analogue system consisting of a nonlinear optical medium with time - dependent refractive index was introduced in @xcite and later on , its experimental implementation was reported @xcite . in @xcite the casimir radiation within a cavity containing a thin semiconducting film with time - dependent conductivity and centered at the middle of the cavity has been investigated . an explicit analogy between photon emission of a coherently pumped thin nonlinear crystal of type @xmath0 inside a cavity and the photon generation via the dce have been established @xcite . in @xcite an experimental layout for measuring the dce has been proposed where the optical length of a cavity is varied in time by means of a train of ultrashort pulses that modulate the effective refractive index of the cavity material . by using a varying boundary condition in a superconducting waveguide @xcite which simulates a single moving mirror ,",
    "the first experimental demonstration of the dce has recently been reported @xcite . moreover , a second observation of the dce has been reported @xcite based on periodical changes in the index of refraction of a microwave cavity with a josephson metamaterials .    motivated by the above - mentioned investigations on analogue models for the dce , in the present contribution we propose a model system for the generation of the casimir radiation in a cavity containing a degenerate optical parametric amplifier ( opa ) which is pumped by an amplitude - modulated field according to the harmonic law @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a constant amplitude and @xmath3 , @xmath4",
    "are , respectively , the amplitude and frequency of modulation . the temporal change in pump amplitude leads to a modulation of the cavity length which is equivalent to an apparent displacement of the cavity mirrors . in all of the previous investigations carried out on the dce",
    ", a kind of rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) has been applied to neglect the contribution of rapidly oscillating terms of the modulation frequency ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the main feature of our treatment is that we release this limitation to include the corresponding counter rotating terms ( crts ) .",
    "we will find that taking into account the crts in the model under consideration leads to an interference between the constant amplitude , @xmath2 , and the oscillatory term .",
    "the total number of generated photons consists of three contributions , i.e. , constant pumping , time varying pumping , and their interference which originates from crts . due to this interference ,",
    "the mean number of generated photons and their quantum statistical properties exhibit oscillatory behaviours which are controllable through the modulation frequency @xmath4 .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section .",
    "[ sec2 ] we describe the model system and show the analogy between the time modulation of the pump and the time modulation of the cavity length in the conventional dce .",
    "we also solve analytically the quantum langevin equations for the cavity - field operators .",
    "we calculate the mean number of generated casimir photons and analyse its temporal behaviour in section .",
    "we study the quadrature squeezing , photon counting statistics and the power spectrum of the generated casimir radiation in section .",
    "finally , we summarize the main results of the paper in section .",
    "as schematically shown in fig.[fig1](a ) , we consider a system composed of a sub - threshold degenerate opa inside a fabry - perot cavity with fixed mirrors at zero temperature .",
    "we assume that the opa is pumed by a coupling field whose amplitude is time - modulated according to eq .",
    "( [ pump ] ) .",
    "we also take into account the dissipation of the cavity field to the environment with a decay rate @xmath5 .",
    "we show that this non - stationary cavity qed results in the dce . in a degenerate opa a pump photon of frequency @xmath6",
    "is down- converted into a pair of identical photons of frequency @xmath7 .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the system in the interaction picture is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9(@xmath10 ) is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of the cavity field .",
    "here , it should be emphasized that in the above hamiltonian we will not make use of the rwa for the term @xmath11 in the amplitude @xmath12 and we want to examine the influence of the corresponding crts on the generation and quantum statistical properties of the casimir photons . before proceeding to discuss the dynamics of the system under consideration , it is worthwhile to beriefly describe the analogy between the time modulation of the pump and the time modulation of the cavity length in the conventional dce .",
    "following the same method as used in @xcite , it is easy to show that the time - modulated nonlinear parametric interaction in the model system , described by the hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) , is equivalent to an apparent periodic displacement of the cavity mirrors which is given by @xmath13 , where the effective length of cavity is @xmath14 , with @xmath15 and @xmath16 as the length and the refractive index of the nonlinear crystal , respectively ( see fig.[fig1](b ) ) . furthermore , the maximum of the effective speed of the mirror is obtained as @xmath17 ( for example , if @xmath18 and @xmath19 hz , then @xmath20 is of order @xmath21 ) . as we will show latter , in comparison to the analogue model introduced in @xcite , where the refractive index of nonlinear crystal coated on the mirror",

    "furthermore , the main characteristics of the power spectrum , i.e. , its height , width , and number of peaks can be controlled , in particular , by adjusting the modulation frequency and the interaction time in the steady state . the results also reveal that the comparison of the output power spectrum in the presence of the time- modulated pumping with one which obtained by constant pumping provides a way for the detection of the generated casimir photons .",
