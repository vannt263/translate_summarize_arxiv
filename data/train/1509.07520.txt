    "the process of planet formation requires that small dust grains in the interstellar medium ( ism ) undergo a dramatic transformation , growing by more than 12 orders of magnitude in order to form terrestrial planets and the cores of gas and ice giants . as a very first step",
    ", these @xmath7m - sized ism dust grains must increase their size and become macroscopic @xcite , a process that alters the optical properties of the dust grains considerably : as grains reach millimeter or larger sizes , the absolute value of the dust opacity , @xmath8 , decreases , and at the same time the power - law spectral index of the dust opacity , @xmath2 ( where @xmath9 ) , becomes smaller ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since thermal dust emission at millimeter and centimeter wavelengths is ( mostly ) in the optically thin regime , the observed dust continuum emission will trace the bulk of the disk mass modulated by the dust opacity : @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the dust mass surface density and @xmath12 is the planck function evaluated at the dust temperature @xmath13 . for optically thin dust ,",
    "warm enough to be in the rayleigh - jeans ( r - j ) regime ( @xmath14 ) , it follows that @xmath15 .",
    "thus , direct measurements of the dust emission spectrum ( i.e. , the spectral energy distribution , sed , at long wavelengths ) can be used to derive the value of @xmath2 , a method extensively employed in the literature .",
    "disk - integrated measurements , from sub - mm to cm wavelengths , have shown that in most protoplanetary disks the value of @xmath2 tends to be lower than in the ism ( where @xmath16 , consistent with the presence of @xmath7m - sized dust grains or smaller in the interstellar medium , * ? ? ?",
    "possible explanations for the low values of @xmath2 include the presence of regions of high optical depth , which will drive the dust emission spectrum to be close to @xmath17 , and thus a low @xmath2 would be inferred ( incorrectly ) .",
    "however , @xcite has shown this would be only plausible for the brightest and most massive disks .",
    "different composition and/or porosity could affect the optical properties of dust grains ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but for a sensible set of dust properties the most significant influence on the opacity spectral index arises from an increase in grain size @xcite",
    ". thus , the difference in the dust opacity spectral index of disks , as compared to the ism , implies that growth of at least 4 orders of magnitude in size has taken place inside circumstellar disks ( for a review see : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "but since most of these measurements are of the global disk properties , they provide limited knowledge of the evolution of the dust properties as a function of the distance to the central star ( hereafter referred to as radius ) .",
    "theoretical analyses predict that the average dust grain size will change with radius , as dust grows and fragments while it is transported throughout the disk @xcite .",
    "a fundamental limiting factor to the largest grain size is that of the radial drift problem . while solids move at keplerian velocities in the disk , the gaseous component moves at slightly sub - keplerian speed due to gas pressure support .",
    "this velocity difference induces a drag in the large particles , which end up losing angular momentum and drifting radially to smaller and smaller orbits , until they are accreted onto the star and lost from the solid population @xcite .",
    "this barrier will limit the maximum grain size allowed in a disk , with mm and cm - sized particles at tens of au from the star drifting inwards in timescale shorter than the disk lifetime @xcite .",
    "thus , measuring changes in the dust properties as a function of radius is essential to investigate the effects of this barrier in the grain size distribution of disks .",
    "only recently have measurements reached the required sensitivity and a sufficient lever arm in wavelength to characterize radial variations of the dust properties @xcite . with wavelength coverage that spanned an order of magnitude , from sub - mm to cm wavelengths , observational constraints in dust opacity were obtained for the disk around the young star as  209 @xcite . in this study ,",
    "a gradient in the value of @xmath2 was found from @xmath18 at @xmath1920",
    "au to @xmath20 at more than @xmath1980  au , while a constant value of the dust opacity throughout the disk failed to reproduce these observations .",
    "furthermore , these results seem to agree with a population of dust grains limited by radial drift . here",
    "we explore further this issue , by studying how the dust properties vary with radius in the protoplanetary disks that surround the young stars cytau , located in the taurus star forming region at a distance of @xmath21  pc @xcite , and doar25 , located in the l1688 dark cloud at a distance of @xmath22  pc @xcite .",
    "doar25 and cytau  are pre - main sequence stars of k5 and m1 spectral type , respectively .",
    "both stars are quite young : cytau  is @xmath23 myr old , while doar25  is about 4 myr old @xcite , and both present a significant emission excess over the stellar photosphere , from near - infrared to millimeter wavelengths .",
    "doar25  has been imaged at sub - millimeter wavelengths with the submillimeter array @xcite , and cytau  was imaged at the 1.3 and 2.8  mm bands with the plateau de bure interferometer @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we triple the number of circumstellar disks for which our multiwavelength analysis has been used to measure any radial changes in the dust properties , particularly in the dust opacity .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : first , we describe the observations and data calibration procedures in section  [ obsdata ] , and we present observational results from these data in section  [ observationalresults ] . in section  [ modeling_emission ]",
    "we discuss the model of the disk emission employed in this paper , followed by section  [ results_modeling ] where observational constraints derived from this modeling are presented .",

    "once a disk is resolved by interferometric observations , its visibility profile will decline from this reference line .",

    "furthermore , a compact source will have a shallower decline with _",

    "dust in the surface layer will absorb the short - wavelength stellar emission and re - radiate it at longer wavelengths . as the disk interior absorbs the reprocessed emission , the inner regions of the disk can be efficiently heated .",

    "more specifically , although the dust composition does affect the absolute value of opacity , the fact that the dust emission is optically thin at long wavelengths (  5.3 ) means that the derivation of the dust opacity spectral index @xmath2 is insensitive to the assumed absolute opacity value and hence dust composition .",
    "this follows since the only frequency dependence when the emission is optically thin corresponds to @xmath123 .    finally ,",

    "thus , variations in the dust properties of these disks , particularly @xmath3 , should be directly constrained without this assumption .    following the method outlined by @xcite , we find the best - fit dust opacity ( which depends on @xmath3 ) , along with the best - fit surface density , that is needed to reproduce the constraints on @xmath208 found in section  [ sigma_temp_results ] . since the temperature profile at each wavelength ( @xmath209 )",

    "@xcite presented simple analytical forms for the variation of @xmath3 with radius for two different regimes : when a population of dust grains is limited by fragmentation of dust particles , whose differential velocity is driven by turbulence in the disk : @xmath217 and when a population of dust grains is limited by radial drift , as larger particles are removed from the population and accreted onto the star due to gas drag : @xmath218 here @xmath219 and @xmath220 are the gas and dust surface density profile , @xmath221 is the dust grain internal density , @xmath222 is the disk turbulence parameter as presented by @xcite , @xmath223 is the velocity at which a collision between dust grains will result in fragmentation rather than growth , @xmath224 is the local keplerian velocity , and @xmath225 is the local sound speed of the gas .    employing our constraints on the disk surface density , which assume a constant gas - to - dust ratio of 100:1 over the entire disk , we compared our derived observational constraints on @xmath3 vs. radius with these grain growth models , adopting standard values for the turbulence ( @xmath226 ) , dust density ( @xmath227 g @xmath228 , from the @xcite abundances adopted in this paper ) , and fragmentation velocity ( @xmath229  m s@xmath230 * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "also , we verify that mm - sized particles are in the epstein regime throughout the disk ( with a stokes number @xmath231 ) , which is a necessary condition for the use of equation  [ drift_barrier ] as the size limit in radial drift . for this particular set of turbulence and fragmentation parameters , the theoretical @xmath3 curves for cytau  and",
    "doar25  are shown in figures  [ amax_cytau ] and [ amax_doar25 ] , respectively , where the continuous line illustrates the maximum grain size for a drift - dominated population , and the dashed blue line correspond to a fragmentation - dominated population .",
    "note that since our constraint on the surface density with radius depends on the adopted grain size distribution slope , @xmath155 , the drift and fragmentation barriers will depend on @xmath155 as well .    in both disks and with this standard set of parameters , the fragmentation barrier under - predicts the maximum grain size achievable .",
    "following equation  [ frag_barrier ] , a better correspondence could be found if : ( 1 )  the disk turbulence were lowered to @xmath232 , or ( 2 )  the gas - to - dust ratio were higher than 100:1 by an order of magnitude , or ( 3 )  the critical velocity for fragmentation were higher than @xmath229  m s@xmath230 .",
    "this last option seems unlikely if grains are compact , given that threshold velocities for fragmentation and/or bouncing of up to a few m s@xmath230 have been measured experimentally for compact centimeter and decimeter - sized grains ( see e.g. , @xcite for silicate grains , @xcite and for icy grains , and @xcite for a review ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if grains are porous ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , fragmentation could occur at higher threshold velocities .",
    "however , porous grains have larger cross sections resulting in mass loss through collisional erosion rather than fragmentation , which similarly halts the growth of these grains @xcite .",
    "now , the second option of a higher gas - to - dust ratio needs to be pursued with measurements of the total gas mass in these disks in particular , but this alternative also seems unlikely given the recent results in the taurus - auriga star forming region where low gas - to - dust ratios ( well below the ism standard of 100:1 ) are inferred for a large number of circumstellar disks by @xcite . finally , the first option of a quiescent disk of low turbulence ( @xmath233 ) for the disks around cytauand doar25(and also as  209 ) seems plausible , and would further augment grain growth .",
    "we test this option by calculating the expected maximum grain size when the disk turbulence is an order of magnitude lower ( @xmath234 ) , and we find a better correspondence with our @xmath3 constraints on cytau  and doar25  ( for this last disk we also increased the fragmentation velocity by 25% ) .",
    "note that values of @xmath232 would still produce turbulent relative velocities high enough for fragmentation , a condition attained when @xmath235 , and confirmed for both cytau  and doar25 .",
    "the prediction of low turbulence should be tested with future observations of the turbulent linewidth in these circumstellar disks .    at the same time",
    ", the radial drift barrier roughly agrees with our @xmath3 inference in both disks .",
    "for doar25 , the growth barrier imposed by a radial drift of macroscopic particles is within a factor of a few of the observational constraint , and the same occurs for cytau  at least up to @xmath236  au .",
    "most likely it is both mechanisms that are at play _ simultaneously _ in these disks .",
    "finally , we note that at a radii @xmath237  au , the population of grains in cytau  is above both barriers by a factor of few at least , and this is the case for both a shallow or a steep grain size distributions .",
    "this result is readily appreciated in the cytau  data , where millimeter - wave emission at 1.3 and 2.8  mm is observed at large distances from the star , indicating the presence of mm - sized grains at @xmath214  au .",
    "if the gas surface density distribution were different from the dust surface density we measured , the pressure gradient term @xmath238 in equation  [ drift_barrier ] would change , and thus a region of higher gas pressure , i.e. , a local maximum in @xmath239 , could trap mm - sized dust grains in the outer disk of cytau . in such a scenario , grains can overcome the radial drift barrier that is expected when the gas distribution just monotonically increases with radius .",
    "the origin of these pressure enhancements is strongly debated : locally they may arise from turbulent eddies @xcite , while on a global disk scale they may emerge from rossby - wave instabilities @xcite , long - lived vortices , or from the gap opened by one or multiple planets . however , higher angular resolution observations of the distribution of small and large grains , as well as observations of tracers in the gas emission , are needed to understand what is the likely cause of these large grains still present in the outer disk of cytau .",
    "over the past several years there have been multiple examples of circumstellar disks where the interpretation of radial variations of the dust properties is supported by resolved observations at mm and cm wavelengths @xcite . for example , in tw  hya , @xcite found that a radially homogeneous distribution of small and large grains ( larger than @xmath240  @xmath7 m ) was not a suitable representation of the observations , and a steeper @xmath103 for the larger grains was required to fit these multi - wavelength dataset .",
    "and recently @xcite studied a sample of disks and found that those with a steep midplane density gradient generally possess a smaller value of @xmath2 , indicative of dust growth and radial evolution .",
    "the largest sample to date has been gathered by @xcite , where dual - wavelength observations of disks in taurus - auriga at angular resolutions between @xmath241 were presented .",
    "this study found evidence for changes in the value of @xmath2 for several sources including cytau .",
    "albeit limited by the angular resolution of the lowest frequency band , which corresponds to @xmath214  au resolution for their 2.7  mm observations of cytau , these authors infer a change from @xmath242 in the inner disk to high @xmath2-values in the outer disk of this young star .",
    "however , given the closeness in frequency of the two wavelengths studied by @xcite , together with the lack of high spatial resolution at 2.7 mm , implies that their constraint is consistent with a constant value of @xmath2 at the @xmath46 level for this particular object . as shown in section  [ beta_constraints ] , our increased wavelength coverage and high sensitivity allows us to discriminate radial variations of the dust emissivity index for cytau  with high significance , where a constant value of @xmath2 is excluded at more than @xmath202 .",
    "this arises because the uncertainty in the spectral index ( @xmath243 ) is directly related to the wavelength coverage and snr of the observations . in the case of dual - wavelength observations , simple error propagation results in an uncertainty of @xmath244 , which indicates that an efficient way to reduce the uncertainty in @xmath245 , and thus in @xmath2 , is to expand the wavelength coverage .    to compare radial changes in the dust properties for different circumstellar disks",
    ", we have gathered measurements from the literature that attempt to constrain @xmath192 , mostly from observations at the 1 and 3  mm bands .",
    "since most of the available measurements barely resolve each circumstellar disk , we employ only two representative measurements of @xmath2 , one from the inner disk regions and another from the outer disk .",
    "thus , for each published result we compile the value of @xmath2 and its @xmath96 uncertainty at the best resolution of the observations ( between @xmath246 au depending on each target ) to illustrate the inner disk constraint in @xmath2 , and at either the observed outer disk radius or at @xmath247  au , whichever is smallest , to represent the constraint of @xmath2 in the outer disk ( except for ry  tau and dg  tau , which at the outer disk radius have an unconstrained value of @xmath2 ; for these we select the outermost radii for which a @xmath2 constraint is still significant ) .",
    "the compiled literature measurements are presented in the left panel of figure  [ comparison_beta ] , where we have computed the slope in @xmath192 between the inner and outer disk for each star ( dashed lines ) , and the average slope in @xmath192 for all the disks analyzed in the literature ( grey shaded region ) .",
    "the steepest change in the dust emissivity spectral index occurs for dg  tau  b ( where @xmath248 at 20au , increasing to @xmath249 at 120 au ; * ? ? ?",
    "excluding the added uncertainty in @xmath2 due to the absolute flux scale uncertainty for the two millimeter - wave bands observed for dg  tau  b , the resulting change in @xmath192 for this object is comparable to the constraints found for cytau , doar25 , and as  209 , which are presented together on the left panel of figure  [ comparison_beta ] .",
    "interestingly , the mean @xmath192 profile from literature measurements is less steep than for the 3 disks analyzed in a consistent fashion .",
    "this could be due to the fact that most previously published observations only include dust emission traced at millimeter wavelengths ( 1 and 3  mm bands ) , which may be optically thick and thus reduce the overall value of @xmath2 .",
    "since the young stars presented in the left panel of figure  [ comparison_beta ] boast some of the brightest disks observed in millimeter continuum emission , they represent a population of massive disks where high optical depth at millimeter wavelengths may be expected .",
    "thus , including long - wavelength observations is critical for the calculation of @xmath192 , not only for the increased lever arm but also to avoid regions of high optical depth .",
    "we note that the comparison between previous results in the literature ( @xmath250 ) and our multiwavelength analysis ( @xmath251 ) should ideally be performed over a similar wavelength range to avoid potential biases between different wavelengths that trace different grain sizes , and could explain some of the differences between @xmath252 and @xmath253 seen in figure  [ comparison_beta ] .",
    "finally , we note that cytau  shows the steepest rise in @xmath2 with radius , indicative of a substantial change in dust properties over tens of au in this disk , while the smoothest rise in the emissivity spectral index occurs for as  209 in the inner disk and for doar25  in the outer disk .",
    "however , these differences at not significant when the disks are compared at the @xmath46 level .",
    "we present multi - wavelength observations of the protoplanetary disks surrounding the young stars cytau  and doar25 .",
    "observations at 0.9 , 1.3 , 2.8 , 8.0 and 9.8  mm spatially resolve the dust continuum emission from these disks , down to scales of tens of au . from observations obtained at 5  cm , we quantify the amount of continuum emission whose origin is not thermal dust emission .",
    "we estimate the level of contamination for doar25  to be @xmath254% of the integrated emission at 8.0 and 9.8  mm , while for cytau  we establish an upper limit of contamination of @xmath255% of the total emission at 7.1  mm .",
    "although these levels of contamination may seem small , they need to be quantified when characterizing the dust emission spectrum .",
    "the temperature and surface density profiles for both disks were constrained at all observed wavelengths shorter than 5  cm , and from this modeling , we find that a constant dust opacity with radius does not fit these observations .",
    "this result is supported by the observational fact that the normalized visibility profiles of the dust continuum emission differ for different wavelengths : cm - wave observations trace emission from a compact disk structure , while mm - wave observations trace a more extended disk structure .",
    "since our modeling indicates that the dust continuum emission is optically thin over the spatial scales explored ( and this is also warranted by the observed brightness temperature profiles in  3.4 ) , the observed emission spectrum will be directly proportional to the dust opacity spectrum , which allows us to infer radial variations of the dust opacity spectral index , @xmath192 .",
    "we find that a constant value of @xmath2 is excluded by our observations at more than @xmath202 in both disks .",
    "close to the central protostar , for @xmath256  au , the constraints on @xmath192 are of high significance and indicate a rapid change of the dust properties between the inner disk and the outer disk . in the outermost regions of the disk where the dust emission has lower snr , we can only set an lower limit for the dust opacity spectral index and we find that @xmath257 for cytau  at @xmath5  au , while @xmath258 for doar25  at @xmath5  au .",
    "we find that for the disks of as  209 , cytau , and doar25 , the profiles of @xmath192 are steeper than for the available @xmath192 constraints from the literature at the @xmath96 level @xcite , while these are all consistent at the @xmath46 level .",
    "the increased wavelength coverage presented here and by @xcite is critical for obtaining constraints of high significance on @xmath192 .    assuming that the changes in the dust properties discussed above arise only from changes in the maximum particle size of the disk grain size distribution , we derive radial variations of the maximum grain size , @xmath6 .",
    "for the two different grain size distribution explored , @xmath212 and @xmath156 , we find a gradient in @xmath3 with increasing grain size at smaller radial distance from the star , in both the cytau  and doar25  disks .",
    "we compare the observational constraints in @xmath6 with theoretical expectations of the maximum grain size when a population of grains grows and evolves while being limited by fragmentation or by radial drift . for an assumed disk turbulence of @xmath259",
    ", the fragmentation barrier does not seem to be the limiting factor in the growth of these grains , as we observe millimeter and centimeter dust particles at distances from the star where the fragmentation barrier should have depleted these large particles . however , our observations seem to be consistent with a low - turbulence disk midplane with @xmath260 in cytau  and doar25 , as well as in as  209 @xcite . if disks are generally low - turbulence , then fragmentation may play a lesser role in shaping the grain size distribution of protoplanetary disks .",
    "future constraints on disk turbulence will be necessary to assess this process . for the cytau  disk ,",
    "the population of grains inferred from our observations is above the growth barrier imposed by radial drift and fragmentation , with a difference of of a factor of a few at @xmath261  au radius .",
    "we hypothesize that this difference could be readily explained if a region of higher gas pressure exists in the outer disk , and is keeping these millimeter - sized particles from drifting inwards .",
    "future high resolution observations that trace millimeter dust grains , as well as the gas distribution , are needed .",
    "observations with the atacama large sub - millimeter array ( alma ) will be extremely well suited for such investigations , as spatial resolutions matching the vla observations at 7  mm ( of @xmath24 or better ) are already possible @xcite .",
    "finally , future observations of multiple disks at different stages of evolution ( classical vs. transitional ) , as well as different stellar mass or disk masses , will provide valuable information related to the first steps toward planet formation .",
