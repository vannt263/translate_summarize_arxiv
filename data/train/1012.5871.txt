    "one of the fundamental problems in the classification of complex surfaces is to find a new family of complex surfaces of general type with @xmath0 . in this paper",
    "we construct a new minimal complex surface of general type with @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .    in order to classify complex surfaces of general type with @xmath0",
    ", it seems to be natural to classify them first up to their topological types .",
    "for instance if @xmath5 is a _ numerical godeaux surface _ , that is , a minimal complex surface of general type with @xmath0 and @xmath6 , then it is known that @xmath7 for some @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the algebraic fundamental group of @xmath5 ; cf.reid  @xcite .",
    "it is conjectured that the moduli space of numerical godeaux surfaces has exactly five irreducible components corresponding to each @xmath10 for all @xmath8 .",
    "the conjecture is proved for @xmath11 ; cf.reid  @xcite .",
    "furthermore for each @xmath8 there are numerical godeaux surfaces with @xmath10 ; cf.bauer-catanese-pignatelli  @xcite .    in case of _ numerical campedelli surfaces _ , that is , minimal complex surfaces of general type with @xmath0 and @xmath1 , it has been known by reid  @xcite and xiao  @xcite that the algebraic fundamental group of a numerical campedelli surface is a finite group of order @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore the topological fundamental groups @xmath13 for any numerical campedelli surfaces are also of order @xmath12 in as far as they have been determined .",
    "hence it is a natural conjecture that @xmath14 for all numerical campedelli surfaces .    conversely one may ask whether every group of order @xmath12 occurs as the topological fundamental group or as the algebraic fundamental group of a numerical campedelli surface .",
    "it is proved that the dihedral groups @xmath15 of order @xmath16 or @xmath17 of order @xmath18 can not be fundamental groups of numerical campedelli surfaces ; naie  @xcite , mendes lopes - pardini  @xcite , mendes lopes - pardini - reid  @xcite , reid  @xcite .",
    "however all groups of order @xmath12 , _ except _",
    "@xmath15 , @xmath17 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , occur as the topological fundamental groups of numerical campedelli surfaces .",
    "the first example of numerical campedelli surfaces was constructed by campedelli himself and his example has @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore mendes lopes , pardini , and reid ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) constructed and classified all numerical campedelli surfaces with @xmath22 and showed that the topological fundamental group equals the algebraic fundamental group .",
    "an example with @xmath23 was constructed by reid  @xcite .",
    "catanese  @xcite constructed an example with @xmath24 by taking a @xmath25-quotient of a certain double cover of a linearly symmetric quintic .",
    "an example with @xmath26 was constructed by inoue  @xcite as the quotients of the hypersurfaces of the product of three elliptic curves .",
    "such an example was also constructed by j. keum  @xcite .",
    "recently , several examples of numerically campedelli surfaces with @xmath27 were constructed by the so - called product - quotient method , that is , first take a product of two curves and then take a quotient of the product by a group action ; bauer - catanese - grunewald - pignatelli  @xcite , bauer - pignatelli  @xcite .",
    "classically many examples of numerical campedelli surfaces with @xmath27 are constructed by the method of taking quotients of group action . on the other hand numerical campedelli surfaces with small fundamental groups",
    "were constructed by the so - called @xmath4-gorenstein smoothing method developed in y. lee - j .",
    "for instance a simply connected numerical campedelli surface was constructed by y. lee - j .",
    "park   and an example with @xmath28 was constructed by j. keum - y .",
    "park  @xcite .    unlike the case of topological fundamental group",
    ", there is a numerical campedelli surface with @xmath29 . recently neves and papadakis  @xcite constructed a numerical campedelli surface with @xmath29 ( in fact @xmath30 ) by constructing the canonical ring of the tale six to one cover using serial unprojection together with a suitable base point free action of @xmath20 .",
    "therefore all abelian groups of order @xmath12 _ except _ @xmath19 occur as the first homology groups ( and algebraic fundamental groups ) of numerical campedelli surfaces . nevertheless , the question on the existence of numerical campedelli surfaces with a given topological type was completely open for @xmath19 until now .    the main result of this paper is the following .",
    "[ theorem : main - theorem - intro ] there exists a minimal complex surface of general type with @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore its algebraic fundamental group @xmath31 is also @xmath19 .    to our knowledge",
    "there were no such examples previously known , and it settles the existence question for numerical campedelli surfaces with @xmath32 and furthermore the existence question for @xmath33 because it can be shown that the algebraic fundamental group of the numerical campedelli surface in the main theorem is also equal to @xmath19 .",
    "the reason is the following argument used in bauer - catanese - pignatelli  @xcite ( pignatelli  @xcite ) : as mentioned above , by reid  @xcite and xiao  @xcite , any numerical campedelli surface has @xmath33 .",
    "then it follows that the algebraic fundamental group is the quotient of the topological fundamental group by the intersection @xmath34 of all normal subgroups of finite index . since the first homology group @xmath35 of the main example is finite , the intersection @xmath34 is contained in the commutator subgroup of the topological fundamental group .",
    "it follows that @xmath35 , the abelian quotient of the topological fundamental group , is also the abelian quotient of the algebraic fundamental group .",
    "it has been known by reid  @xcite and xiao  @xcite again that the only possible non - abelian group of algebraic fundamental groups for a numerical campedelli surface is the quaternion group @xmath36 ; but , its abelian quotient is @xmath37 .",
    "therefore the algebraic fundamental group of the surface in the main theorem above is abelian and hence it is equal to @xmath19 .    in order to construct",
    "such a surface we use the @xmath4-gorenstein smoothing method in y. lee - j .",
    "we blow up an elliptic enriques surface @xmath38 in a suitable set of points so that we obtain a surface @xmath39 with special linear chains of @xmath40 s .",
    "then , by contracting these linear chains , we obtain a singular surface @xmath41 with permissible singular points in section  [ section : main - construction ] .",
    "each of these singular points admits a local @xmath4-gorenstein smoothing . in section  [ section : global - q ]",
    "we show that the obstruction space of a global @xmath4-gorenstein smoothing of the singular surface @xmath41 is zero by a similar strategy as in j. keum - y .",
    "park  @xcite .",
    "hence these local smoothings can be glued to a global @xmath4-gorenstein smoothing of the whole singular surface @xmath41 .",
    "finally , we show that a general fiber @xmath42 of a @xmath4-gorenstein smoothing of @xmath41 is the desired surface .",
    "the main ingredient of this paper is the proof of @xmath43 in section  [ section : z_4 ] . for proving it , instead of a general fiber @xmath42",
    ", we consider a rational blow - down @xmath44-manifold @xmath45 obtained by replacing certain small neighborhoods of the linear chains in @xmath39 with the corresponding milnor fibers .",
    "the rational blow - down @xmath44-manifold @xmath45 is known to be diffeomorphic to a general fiber @xmath42 by milnor fiber theory .",
    "we first prove @xmath46 by analyzing the long exact sequence of homologies induced from a pair ( @xmath45 , the milnor fibers ) .",
    "we then construct carefully a certain loop @xmath47 lying on a certain curve of genus @xmath48 in the blown - up surface @xmath39 and we prove that @xmath49 is generated by the loop @xmath47 , which finishes the proof . in order to show that the loop @xmath47 is a generator of @xmath49 , we lift the loop @xmath50 , a loop twice of @xmath47 , up to a certain blown - up k3 surface @xmath51 which is a unramified double cover of the blown - up enriques surface @xmath39 and in @xmath51 we construct a real two dimensional surface @xmath52 such that the lifting of @xmath50 is one of the boundary components of @xmath52 . by analyzing the boundaries of @xmath52",
    "we can show that the lifting of @xmath50 into @xmath51 is not homologous to zero and this fact will imply that @xmath47 is a generator of @xmath49 .",
    "in this paper we construct four different families of numerical campedelli surfaces with torsion @xmath19 .",
    "we will show that there is a @xmath4-gorenstein smoothing of the singular surface @xmath41 in the main construction such that a general fiber @xmath42 of the @xmath4-gorenstein smoothing of @xmath41 has a non - ample canonical divisor ; proposition  [ proposition : main - not - ample ] . in ",
    "[ subsection : main - modified - ample ] , by modifying the configuration used in the main construction , we construct another numerical campedelli surface with @xmath2 whose canonical divisor is ample .",
    "furthermore , we construct two more examples of numerical campedelli surface with @xmath2 using different configurations in  [ subsection : more - not - ample ] . finally , we also construct a numerical campedelli surface with @xmath53 using a similar method in appendix .",
