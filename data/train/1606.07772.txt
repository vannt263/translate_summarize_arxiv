    "we are fundamentally driven to find and tell stories , likened to _ pan narrans _ or _",
    "homo narrativus_. stories are encoded in art , language , and even in the mathematics of physics : we use equations to represent both simple and complicated functions that describe our observations of the real world . in science , we formalize the ideas that best fit our experience with principles such as occam s razor : the simplest story is the one we should trust .",
    "we tend to prefer stories that fit into the molds which are familiar , and reject narratives that do not align with our experience @xcite .",
    "we seek to better understand stories that are captured and shared in written form , a medium that since inception has radically changed how information flows @xcite . without evolved cues from tone , facial expression , or body language , written stories",
    "are forced to capture the entire transfer of experience on a page .",
    "an often integral part of a written story is the emotional experience that is evoked in the reader . here",
    ", we use a simple , robust sentiment analysis tool to extract the reader - perceived emotional content of written stories as they unfold on the page .",
    "we objectively test aspects of the theories of folkloristics @xcite , specifically the commonality of core stories within societal boundaries @xcite .",
    "a major component of folkloristics is the study of society and culture through literary analysis .",
    "this is sometimes referred to as _ narratology _ , which at its core is `` a series of events , real or fictional , presented to the reader or the listener '' @xcite .",
    "in our present treatment , we consider the plot as the `` backbone '' of events that occur in a chronological sequence ( more detail on previous theories of plot are in appendix  [ sec : plots ] ) .",
    "while the plot captures the mechanics of a narrative and the structure encodes their delivery , in the present work we examine the emotional arc that is invoked through the words used .",
    "the emotional arc of a story does not give us direct information about the plot or the intended meaning of the story , but rather exists as part of the whole narrative ( e.g. , an emotional arc showing a fall in sentiment throughout a story may arise from very different plot and structure combinations ) .",
    "this distinction between the emotional arc and the plot of a story is one point of misunderstanding in other work that has drawn criticism from the digital humanities community @xcite . through the identification of motifs @xcite , narrative theories",
    "@xcite allow us to analyze , interpret , describe , and compare stories across cultures and regions of the world @xcite .",
    "we show that automated extraction of emotional arcs is not only possibly , but can test previous theories and provide new insights with the potential to quantify unobserved trends as the field transitions from data - scarce to data - rich @xcite .",
    "the rejected master s thesis of kurt vonnegut  which he personally considered his greatest contribution  defines the _ emotional arc _ of a story on the `` beginning  end '' and `` ill fortune  great fortune '' axes @xcite .",
    "vonnegut finds a remarkable similarity between cinderella and the origin story of christianity in the old testament ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vonnegut ] in appendix  [ sec : extras ] ) , leading us to search for all such groupings . in a recorded lecture available on youtube @xcite ,",
    "vonnegut asserted :    `` there is no reason why the simple shapes of stories ca nt be fed into computers , they are beautiful shapes . ''    for our analysis , we apply three independent tools : matrix decomposition by singular value decomposition ( svd ) , supervised learning by agglomerative ( hierarchical ) clustering with ward s method , and unsupervised learning by a self organizing map ( som , a type of neural network ) .",
    "each tool encompasses different strengths : the svd finds the underlying basis of all of the emotional arcs , the clustering classifies the emotional arcs into distinct groups , and the som generates arcs from noise which are similar to those in our corpus using a stochastic process .",
    "it is only by considering the results of each tool in support of each other that we are able to confirm our findings .",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "we first introduce our methods in section  [ sec : methods ] , we then discuss the combined results of each method in section  [ sec : results ] , and we present our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusion ] . a graphical outline of the methodology and results can be found as fig .",
    "[ fig : infographic ] in appendix  [ sec : extras ] .",
    "to generate emotional arcs , we analyze the sentiment of 10,000 word windows , which we slide through the text ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : timeseries - schematic ] ) .",
    "we rate the emotional content of each window using our hedonometer with the labmt dataset , chosen for lexical coverage and its ability to generate meaningful word shift graphs , specifically using 10,000 words as a minimum necessary to generate meaningful sentiment scores @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that dictionary - based methods for sentiment analysis usually perform worse than random on individual sentences @xcite , and although this issue can be resolved by using a rolling average of sentences scores , it begets a basic misunderstanding of similar efforts @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : harry - potter ] , we show the emotional arc of _ harry potter and the deathly hallows _ , the final book in the popular harry potter series by j.k . rowling .",
    "while the plot of the book is nested and complicated , the emotional arc associated with each sub - narrative is clearly visible .",
    "we analyze the emotional arcs corresponding to complete books , and to limit the conflation of multiple core emotional arcs , we restrict our analysis to shorter books by selecting a maximum number of words when building our filter .",

    "we apply rough filters to the collection ( roughly 50,000 books ) in an attempt to obtain a set of books that represent english works of fiction .",
    "we start by selecting for only english books , with total words between 20,000 and 100,000 , with more than 40 downloads from the project gutenberg website , and with library of congress class corresponding to english fiction . to ensure that the 40-download limit is not influencing the results here , we further test each method for 10 , 20 , 40 , and 80 download thresholds , in each case confirming the 40 download findings to be qualitatively unchanged .",
    "next , we remove books with any word in the title from a list of keywords ( e.g. , `` poems '' and `` collection '' , full list in appendix  [ sec : construction ] ) . from within this set of books , we remove the front and back matter of each book using regular expression pattern matches that match on 98.9% of the books included .",

    "we use ward s method to generate a hierarchical clustering of stories , which proceeds by minimizing variance between clusters of books @xcite .",

    "the som works by finding the most similar emotional arc in a random collection of arcs .",
    "we use an 8x8 som ( for 64 nodes , roughly 5% of the number of books ) , connected on a square grid , training according to the original procedure ( with winner take all , and scaling functions across both distance and magnitude ) .",
    "we take the neighborhood influence function at iteration @xmath4 as @xmath18\\ ] ] for a node @xmath19 in the set of nodes @xmath20 , with distance function @xmath21 given above and total number of nodes @xmath1 . for results shown here",

    "we implement the learning adaptation function at training iteration @xmath4 as @xmath23 , again with @xmath24 , a standard value for the training hyper - parameters .",
    "we obtain a collection of 1,327  books that are mostly , but not all , fictional stories by using metadata from project gutenberg to construct a rough filter .",
    "we find broad support for the following six emotional arcs :    * `` rags to riches '' ( rise ) .",

    "`` cinderella '' ( rise - fall - rise ) . *",
    "`` oedipus '' ( fall - rise - fall ) .",
    "importantly , we obtain these same six emotional arcs from all possible arcs by observing them as the result of three methods : as modes from a matrix decomposition by svd , as clusters in a hierarchical clustering using ward s algorithm , and as clusters using unsupervised machine learning . we examine each of the results in this section .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : svd-12-comp ] we show the leading 12 modes in both the weighted ( dark ) and un - weighted ( lighter ) representation . in total , the first 12 modes explain 80% and 94% of the variance from the mean centered and raw time series , respectively .",
    "the modes are from mean - centered emotional arcs , such that the first svd mode need not extract the average from the labmt scores nor the positivity bias present in language @xcite .",
    "the coefficients for each mode within a single emotional arc are both positive and negative , so we need to consider both the modes and their negation",
    ". we can immediately recognize the familiar shapes of core emotional arcs in the first four modes , and compositions of these emotional arcs in modes 5 and 6 .",
    "we observe `` rags to riches '' ( mode 1 , positive ) , `` tragedy '' or `` riches to rags '' ( mode 1 , negative ) , vonnegut s `` man in a hole '' ( mode 2 , positive ) , `` icarus '' ( mode 2 , negative ) , `` cinderella '' ( mode 3 , positive ) , `` oedipus '' ( mode 3 , negative ) .",
    "we choose to include modes 712 only for completeness , as these high frequency modes have little contribution to variance and do not align with core emotional arc archetypes from other methods ( more below ) .",
    "we emphasize that by definition of the svd , the mode coefficients in @xmath14 can be either positive and negative , such that the modes themselves explain variance with both the positive and negative version . in the right panels of each mode in fig .",
    "[ fig : svd-12-comp ] we project the 1,327  stories onto each of first six modes and show the resulting coefficients .",
    "while none are far from 0 ( as would be expected ) , mode 1 has a mean slightly above 0 and both modes 3 and 4 have means slightly below 0 . to sort the books by their coefficient for each mode , we normalize the coefficients within each book in the rows of @xmath14 to sum to 1 , accounting for books with higher total energy , and these are the coefficients shown in the right panels of each mode in fig .",

    "there are many possible emotional arcs in the space that we consider . to demonstrate that these specific arcs are uniquely compelling as stories written by and for _ homo narrativus _ , we consider the true emotional arcs in relation to their most suitable comparison : the book with randomly shuffled words ( `` word salad '' ) and the resulting text from a 2-gram markov model trained on the individual book itself ( `` nonsense '' ) .",
    "we chose to compare to `` word salad '' and `` nonsense '' versions as they are more representative of a null model : written stories that are without coherent plot or structure to generate a coherent emotional arc , which is not true of a stochastic process ( e.g. , a random walk model or noise ) .",

    "the success of the stories underlying these emotional arcs suggests that the emotional experience of readers strongly affects how stories are shared .",
    "we find `` icarus '' ( -sv 2 ) , `` oedipus '' ( -sv 3 ) , and two sequential `` man in a hole '' arcs ( sv 4 ) , are the three most successful emotional arcs .",

    "we again emphasize that our method of mining emotional arcs from novels does not measure the popular notion of `` plot '' . to make the distinction even clearer ,",
    "using terms often employed in narratology we consider the common notion of `` plot '' to be _ fabula _ whereas the emotional arc is an attempt to measure the emotional trajectory of the _ syuzhet _ , what could be commonly referred to as the `` structure '' @xcite .",
    "for example , the difference between booker s _ overcoming the monster _ and _ rags to riches _ may very well have a similar emotional arc , while being distinct plots .",
    "nevertheless , we include our research on the different types of plots that have been enumerated .",
    "there have been various hand - coded attempts to enumerate and classify the core types of stories from their plots , including models that generalize broad categories and detailed classification systems .",
    "we consider a range of these theories in turn while noting that plot similarities do not necessitate a concordance of emotional arcs .",
    "* three plots : in his 1959 book , foster - harris contends that there are three basic patterns of plot ( extending from the one central pattern of conflict ) : the happy ending , the unhappy ending , and the tragedy @xcite . in these three versions ,",
    "the outcome of the story hinges on the nature and fortune of a central character : virtuous , selfish , or struck by fate , respectively . * seven plots : often espoused as early as elementary school in the united states",
    ", we have the notion that plots revolve around the conflict of an individual with either ( 1 ) him or herself , ( 2 ) nature , ( 3 ) another individual , ( 4 ) the environment , ( 5 ) technology , ( 6 ) the supernatural , or ( 7 ) a higher power @xcite . * seven plots : representing over three decades of work , christopher booker s _ the seven basic plots : why we tell stories _ describes in great detail seven narrative structures : @xcite * * overcoming the monster ( e.g. , _ beowulf _ ) . * * rags to riches ( e.g. , _ cinderella _ ) . * * the quest ( e.g. , _ king solomon s mines _ ) . *",
    "* voyage and return ( e.g. , _ the time machine _ ) . * * comedy ( e.g. , _ a midsummer night s dream _ ) . * * tragedy ( e.g. , _ anna karenina _ ) . * * rebirth ( e.g. , _ beauty and the beast _ ) .",
    "+ in addition to these seven , booker contends that the unhappy ending of all but the tragedy are also possible . * twenty plots : in _ 20 master plots _ , ronald tobias proposes plots that include `` quest '' , `` underdog '' , `` metamorphosis '' , `` ascension '' , and `` descension '' @xcite .",
    "* thirty - six plots : in a translation by lucille ray , georges polti attempts to reconstruct the 36 plots that he posits gozzi originally enumerated @xcite .",
    "these are quite specific and include `` rivalry of kinsmen '' , `` all sacrificed for passion '' , both involuntary and voluntary `` crimes of love '' ( with many more on this theme ) , `` pursuit '' , and `` falling prey to cruelty of misfortune '' .",
    "here we include additional supporting information .",
    "to generate emotional arcs , we consider many different approaches with the goal of generating time series that meaningfully reflect the narrative sentiment . in general",
    ", we proceed as described in fig .",
    "[ fig : timeseries - schematic ] and consider a method of breaking up the text as having three ( interdependent ) parameter choices for a sliding window :    1 .",
    "length of the desired sample text .",
    "2 .   breakpoint between samples . 3 .",
    "overlap of each sample .",
    "these methods vary between rating individual words with no overlap to rating the entire text . to make our choice , we consider competing two objectives of time series generation : meaningfulness of sentiment scores and increased temporal resolution of time series . for the most accurate sentiment scores",
    ", we can use the entire book .",
    "the highest temporal resolution is possible with a sliding window of length 1 , generating time series that have potentially as many data points as words in the book .    since our goal is not only the generation of time series , but the comparison of time series across texts , we consider the additional objective of consistency .",
    "we seek time series which are consistent both in the accuracy of the time series , as well as consistent in the length of the resulting time series .",
    "again these goals are orthogonal , and we note that our choice here can be tuned to test the sensitivity .",
    "we normalize the length of emotional arcs for books of different length ( while using a fixed window size ) by varying the amount that the window needs to move . to make a time series of length @xmath25 from a book with @xmath1 words",
    ", we fix the sample length at @xmath19 and set the overlap of samples to @xmath26 words .",
    "this guarantees that we have temporal resolution @xmath25 and sample length @xmath19 for any @xmath27 .",
    "we do not consider books with @xmath28 words .    to generate a sentiment score as in fig .",
    "[ fig : timeseries - schematic ] , we use a dictionary based approach for transparency and understanding of sentiment .",
    "we select the labmt dictionary for robust performance over many corpora and best coverage of word usage .",
    "in particular , we determine a sample @xmath29 s average happiness using the equation : @xmath30 where we denote each of the @xmath1 words in a given dictionary as @xmath31 , word sentiment scores as @xmath32 , word frequency as @xmath33 , and normalized frequency of @xmath31 in @xmath29 as @xmath34 .",
    "we note here that , in general , for each emotional arc we subtract the mean before computing the distance or clustering .      in our first analysis",
    ", we generated the null set of emotional arc time series by randomly shuffling the words in each book .",
    "other variations on generating this null set include sampling from a phrase - level parse of the book with a markov process , using continuous space random walks directly , or shuffling on sentences .",
    "even more sophisticated approaches could utilize recursive neural nets ( rnns ) , for examples see http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn - effectiveness/. for a realistic comparison to meaningful stories , we generate `` nonsense '' using a markov chain model ( mcm ) trained on 2-grams from each book . to contrast these approaches , consider the beginning of one null version of _",

    "this was such a rule at processions and besides , that finished the first witness , said alice , and went stamping about , reminding her very much at first but she stopped hastily , for the rest were quite silent for a baby altogether alice did nt think , said the queen , who was sitting on a little worried .",
    "sure , it ll never go there again said alice , who had been to her in such a nice little dog near our house i should say with what porpoise .",
    "you do nt seem to put everything upon bill . and the muscular strength , which remained some time in silence at last she spread out her hand in hand , in chains , with the dream of wonderland of long ago anything had happened .",
    "as far out to be nothing but the great wonder is , said alice , with their hands and feet at the flowers and the queen say only yesterday you deserved to be two people . here",

    "everything seemed to be sure but i shall be a very long silence after this , as it s coming down . in that direction ,",
    "the duchess said to alice a good deal on where you want to go .",

    "so they could nt guess of what work it would be like , said the king sharply do you take me for his housemaid , she pictured to herself , after all .",
    "yes , but it was quite silent for a rabbit .",
    "she waited for a minute , nurse .",
    "begin at the house before she had tired herself out with trying , the queen put on your shoes and stockings for you said the dodo .",
    "how can i have nt opened it yet , before alice could see it trot away quietly into the roof of the mock turtle , suddenly dropping his voice , what have you been doing here .",
    "it was high time to begin with , the gryphon added come , there s no pleasing them .",
    "alice remained looking thoughtfully at the other , saying to herself , whenever i eat or drink anything so i should think you d like it , said the caterpillar .",
    "ugh said the king .",
