    "successful inflation then requires the @xmath97 field to have just enough kinetic energy so that it reaches the local maximum of the potential with negligible kinetic energy .",
    "this seems rather improbable since it is realized only for a very narrow band of initial values .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the @xmath106-term ( @xmath107 ) in the potential is positive .",

    "( @xmath110 for @xmath57 tev ) , the @xmath106-term in the potential does not play a significant role .",

    "since the derivative of the radiative term has a lower bound at @xmath111 depending on @xmath15 , this condition puts a lower bound on @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) for @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "there is also a different branch of solutions with higher values of @xmath27 where instead of the radiative term the quartic term is important .",
    "these solutions allow smaller values of @xmath15 , but with the quartic term dominating the spectral index is greater than unity . ]    here some discussion of initial conditions is in order .",
    "the initial values of the fields can vary in different regions of the universe .",
    "furthermore , the couplings in the khler potential are determined by the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of moduli fields , which can also vary in different regions .",
    "the regions with vevs such that the inflaton mass is suppressed will inflate more and become exponentially large compared to other regions . in this sense , for negative values of @xmath22 so that the potential has a positive ( mass)@xmath116 term , the smallness of @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) can be regarded as a selection effect ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion )",
    ".    however , for positive values of @xmath22 the potential has a negative ( mass)@xmath116 term which can lead to a local maximum .",
    "once the inflaton field is sufficiently close to this local maximum ( with negligible kinetic energy ) , eternal inflation is realized .",
    "it would then seem that the regions satisfying the conditions for eternal inflation would always dominate , since even if they are initially rare , their volume will increase indefinitely @xcite .",
    "it is , however , also possible that there are no regions satisfying these conditions .",
    "alternatively , eternal inflation could occur not only close to the local maximum mentioned above , but also at higher energies regardless of the value of @xmath22 .",
    "it then becomes notoriously difficult , if not impossible , to compute the probability distribution of observables such as @xmath0 , even if the initial distribution of @xmath22 is assumed to be known .    to summarize , it is not clear whether the parameter range explored in this paper is less likely to be observed compared to the minimal khler potential or negative @xmath22 cases .",
    "even if we only consider @xmath22 small enough so that the potential remains monotonic , @xmath0 can still be significantly lower compared to the minimal khler case for large values of @xmath15 , with @xmath119 for @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "finally , we note that for susy hybrid inflation there are additional constraints if the symmetry breaking pattern produces cosmic strings @xcite .",
    "for example , strings are produced when @xmath122 break @xmath123 to @xmath124 matter parity , but not when @xmath122 are @xmath125 doublets .",
    "in this section we assumed that cosmic strings are not produced .",
    "a variation on susy hybrid inflation is obtained by imposing a @xmath126 symmetry on the superpotential , so that only even powers of the combination @xmath127 are allowed @xcite : @xmath128 where the dimensionless parameter @xmath15 is absorbed in @xmath129 .",
    "the resulting scalar potential possesses two ( symmetric ) valleys of local minima which are suitable for inflation and along which the gut symmetry is broken .",
    "the inclination of these valleys is already non - zero at the classical level and the end of inflation is smooth , in contrast to susy hybrid inflation .",
    "an important consequence is that potential problems associated with topological defects are avoided .",
