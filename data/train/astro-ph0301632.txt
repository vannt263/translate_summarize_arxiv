    "measurement of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation have shown the universe to be ( very close to ) spatially flat .",
    "however , matter only makes up a third of the critical density  the dominant contribution to the energy density of the universe appears to exist in an unclustered form called `` dark energy '' .",
    "furthermore , observations of distant supernovae have indicated that the expansion of the universe has entered a phase of acceleration .",
    "this is explicable if dark energy has recently come to dominate the dynamics of the universe and exerts a large negative pressure .",
    "this situation occurs naturally if einstein s equations contain a cosmological constant , but the observed magnitude of the vacuum energy is wildly inconsistent with the current predictions of quantum physics .",
    "this has motivated the consideration of a more general dark energy equation of state , @xmath4 ( turner & white 1997 ) .",
    "an accelerating universe is produced if @xmath5 and vacuum energy is described by @xmath6 .",
    "if the dark energy is the product of new physics , such as quintessence ( e.g. ratra & peebles 1988 ) , then the resulting equation of state varies with redshift and must be treated as a more general @xmath7 ( e.g. linder & huterer 2003 ) .    securing more accurate measurements of the dark energy component",
    "is of prime cosmological importance .",
    "a number of methods have been investigated , most notably the use of type ia supernovae as `` standard candles '' ( e.g. weller & albrecht 2002 ) .",
    "other possible probes include counts of galaxies ( newman & davis 2000 ) and of clusters ( haiman et al . 2001 ) , weak gravitational lensing ( cooray & huterer 1999 ) , the alcock - paczynski test applied to small - scale galaxy correlations ( ballinger et al .",
    "1996 ) and use of the cmb ( e.g. douspis et al . 2003 ) . in this paper",
    "we examine a probe of dark energy that has not received much attention in the literature ( e.g. lahav 2002 ) , but which we believe has many advantages : baryonic oscillations in the galaxy power spectrum .",
    "the cmb power spectrum contains acoustic peaks .",
    "coupling between baryons and photons at recombination imprints these `` wiggles '' into the matter power spectrum on a scale corresponding to the sound horizon in the early universe ( peebles & yu 1970 , eisenstein & hu 1998 ) .",
    "the positions of the peaks and troughs in fourier space are calculable from straight - forward linear physics and act like a `` standard cosmological ruler '' ( eisenstein , hu & tegmark 1998 ) . therefore a power spectrum analysis of a galaxy redshift survey containing acoustic oscillations can be used to measure the cosmological parameters ( eisenstein 2002 ) : the conversion of the redshift data into real space requires values of the parameters to be assumed ; an incorrect choice leads to a distortion of the power spectrum and the appearance of the acoustic peaks in the wrong places .",
    "standard ruler techniques for deducing the cosmic parameters have been proposed many times before . in the alcock - paczynski test ( alcock & paczynski 1979 )",
    "a spherical system is distorted into an ellipsoid in the wrong cosmological model .",
    "other examples include the detection of a characteristic clustering scale within the 2df quasar survey ( roukema , mamon & bajtlik 2002 ) and the use of the angular power spectrum of dark matter haloes ( cooray et al .",
    "our study is focussed on the ability of the standard ruler provided by the baryonic peaks to measure the dark energy .",
    "mapping the acoustic peaks in the galaxy power spectrum at high precision , matching those already measured in the cmb power spectrum , would provide a spectacular confirmation of the standard cosmological model in which mass overdensities grow from the seeds of cmb fluctuations .",
    "the sharp features of the baryonic oscillations represent a powerful and precise observational test of the current cosmological paradigm ( `` @xmath8-cdm '' ) .",
    "accurate delineation of the baryonic oscillations lies beyond the current state - of - the - art galaxy redshift surveys , the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( colless et al .",
    "2001 ) and sloan digital sky survey ( york et al . 2000 ) .",
    "moreover , it is advantageous to place the survey volume at higher redshift ( eisenstein 2002 ) , where the linear regime of galaxy clustering extends to smaller physical scales ( unveiling acoustic oscillations to higher spatial frequencies ) .",
    "in this initial study we present a simple `` proof - of - concept '' that acoustic oscillations measured at high redshift may be used to accurately determine the dark energy parameter @xmath2 , restricting our attention to cosmological models with constant ( redshift - independent ) @xmath2 .",
    "we perform simulations to quantify the scale of redshift survey required to recover the wiggles and determine the resulting constraints on @xmath2 .",
    "we suggest that measurement of the dark energy should be a prime motivation for the next - generation galaxy redshift survey .",
    "in this section we investigate the scale of redshift survey required to measure the acoustic oscillations in the galaxy power spectrum with a specified accuracy .",
    "we modelled the baryonic oscillations using the transfer function fitting formulae of eisenstein & hu ( 1998 ) .",
    "the matter power spectrum @xmath9 is deduced from the transfer function @xmath10 using @xmath11 ; we took the primordial spectral slope to be @xmath12 , as ( approximately ) suggested by inflationary models , and fixed the normalization @xmath13 such that @xmath14 .",
    "the transfer function model is specified by assigning values to the matter density @xmath15 , the baryon density @xmath16 and hubble s constant @xmath17(100 km s@xmath18 mpc@xmath18 ) .",
    "we assumed that it does not depend on the dark energy equation of state : the energy density of dark energy , @xmath19 , relative to that of matter , @xmath20 , scales with redshift as @xmath21 and is a negligible contributor to physics before recombination ( as @xmath5 ) .",
    "of course more complex dark energy models with varying @xmath2 may lead to significant effects at the epoch of recombination ; we do not consider these here , but point out that the cmb is well described by simple matter - dominated models ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) . in this section",
    "we assume @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath6 ( i.e. a cosmological constant ) .",
    "our assumed value for @xmath16 is consistent with the latest cmb results ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) , constraints from big bang nucleosynthesis theory ( e.g. omeara et al .",
    "2001 ) , and the shape of the galaxy power spectrum measured by the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( percival et al .",
    "we assume throughout this study that the universe is flat , @xmath25 .",
    "the baryonic oscillations can be conveniently displayed by dividing the model @xmath9 by a smooth reference spectrum containing no wiggles ( lower panel of figure [ figpkmod ] ; the reference spectrum was obtained from the fitting formulae of eisenstein & hu ( 1998 ) together with the transfer function ) .",
    "the result is well - approximated by a slowly - decaying sinusoidal function whose peaks are harmonics of the sound horizon scale : approximate formulae for their positions in fourier space are given by eisenstein & hu ( 1998 ) .",
    "the amplitude of the wiggles increases with the baryon density @xmath16 .",
    "the key quantity we wish to observe is the `` wavelength '' of the acoustic oscillations in @xmath26-space , which we denote as @xmath27 , and which is related to the sound horizon at recombination by @xmath28 .    , @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",

    "we fixed the overall amplitude of @xmath9 such that @xmath46.,width=264 ]    if dark energy is neglected at high redshift , the co - moving sound horizon size at last scattering , @xmath47 , is given by ( hu & sugiyama 1995 , cornish 2001 ) : @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 are the values of the scale factor @xmath51 at recombination and matter - radiation equality respectively .",

    "@xmath27 is our `` standard measuring rod '' . in a redshift survey at intermediate redshift @xmath40 ,",
    "the _ apparent _ size of the oscillation wavescale @xmath27 will depend on the cosmological geometry , now including the effects of dark energy . as we will see in section [ secwmeas ]",
    ", the effects of assuming an incorrect world model ( e.g. incorrect @xmath2 ) would include a distortion of the measured value of @xmath27 .",
    "( there will be different effects parallel and perpendicular to the line - of - sight , but these are averaged out in our approach ) .",
    "to zeroth order , the precision with which we can empirically measure @xmath27 tells us how accurately we can measure the geometrical distance to the redshift @xmath40 and hence how accurately we can measure the equation of state .",
    "we have assumed that the power spectra of galaxies and of matter are related by a linear bias factor @xmath55 ( where @xmath56 ) . provided our simulated surveys are dominated by sample variance ( see section [ secsimpcalc ] ) , the value of @xmath55 is unimportant : the fractional error bars @xmath57 ( i.e. the appearance of figures [ figpkmod ] and [ figpkreal ] ) do not change if @xmath9 is scaled by a constant factor ( see equation [ eqerr ] ) . however , increasing the value of @xmath55 ( hence increasing @xmath58 ) reduces the fractional error due to shot noise , and hence reduces the number of objects required to render shot noise negligible , by a factor @xmath59 . the assumption of linear bias is simplistic and we plan to include more complicated ( redshift - dependent ) biassing schemes in a future study .",
    "we scaled the power spectrum to redshift @xmath40 using the appropriate growth factor , @xmath60 . throughout this paper",
    "we use the approximation of carroll , press & turner ( 1992 ) for @xmath61 .",
    "this formula is only valid for @xmath6 , but is a satisfactory estimate for models with @xmath62 , given that we only treat small departures from @xmath6 and that we divide out the overall shape of @xmath9 in the analysis procedure .",
    "these model power spectra are only valid in the linear regime of structure formation ; on smaller scales the non - linear growth of structure washes out the baryonic oscillations . at redshift zero",
    ", the linear regime only extends to @xmath63 mpc@xmath18 ( see meiksin , white & peacock 1999 , percival et al .",
    "2001 ) and perhaps only the first major peak shown in figure [ figpkmod ] is preserved ( i.e. the peak at @xmath64 mpc@xmath18 ; there is a small peak predicted at @xmath65 mpc@xmath18 which is undetectable due to cosmic variance ) . at higher redshifts ( @xmath66 ) the linear regime extends to much smaller scales , unveiling more acoustic peaks .",
    "moreover , a high - redshift study is necessary to probe dark energy effectively : the conversion of redshifts to spatial scales only depends on the hubble constant @xmath67 at low @xmath40 and can not distinguish between different values of @xmath2 .",
    "a galaxy power spectrum deduced from a redshift survey is subject to redshift - space distortions owing to the peculiar velocities galaxies possess on top of the bulk hubble flow .",
    "there are two effects ( kaiser 1987 ) : the coherent infall of galaxies into concentrations of mass ( which boosts power on all scales by a constant factor ) and the incoherent velocities of galaxies in the central regions of clusters ( which damps power on small scales ) .",
    "we make no attempt to simulate these effects .",
    "redshift - space distortions will only produce smooth changes in the shape of the angle - averaged @xmath9 , not sharp features such as acoustic peaks , and we note again that the fractional error bars @xmath57 do not depend on the absolute value of @xmath9 ( equation [ eqerr ] ) .",
    "in fact , we explicitly divide out the shape using the smooth reference spectrum . moreover",
    ", incoherent velocities do not have an important effect on the large scales probed by acoustic oscillations .",
    "these velocities can be modelled by a 1d pairwise dispersion @xmath68 , and become important on scales @xmath26 where @xmath69 .",
    "at redshift zero , @xmath70 km s@xmath18 and power is hence damped on scales @xmath71 mpc@xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , simulations indicate that the value of @xmath68 drops by a factor @xmath72 between @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( magira , jing & suto 2000 ) .",
    "some models of galaxy clustering ( peacock & smith 2000 , seljak 2000 ) predict that the baryonic oscillations in the power spectrum are diluted by a wiggle - free halo contribution ( which amounts to a non - local recipe for bias , in which the probability of finding a galaxy is not a simple function of the local mass density ) . in our initial treatment",
    "we assume a standard linear bias factor .",
    "however , this should not modify our results to first order : at @xmath73 , the halo contribution to the matter power spectrum becomes equal to the linear contribution at @xmath75 mpc@xmath18 ( peacock & smith 2000 , figure 2 ) , whereas most of our high - redshift constraining power ( all of it in the case of @xmath76 ) originates from @xmath77 mpc@xmath18 . at higher redshifts",
    "the transition in these halo clustering models scales to higher @xmath26 as described in smith et al .",
    "( 2002 , figure 15 ) .",
    "a simple calculation demonstrates that to delineate the oscillations in the galaxy power spectrum accurately , we need to survey a cosmological volume greater than that of the local sloan digital sky survey ( which we take as a uniform cone of @xmath78 deg@xmath79 to @xmath80 , i.e. @xmath81 mpc@xmath82 ) .",
    "there are two sources of statistical error in a power spectrum measurement : _ sample variance _ ( the number of independent wavelengths @xmath83 of a given fluctuation that can fit into the survey volume @xmath84 ) and _ shot noise _",
    "( the imperfect sampling of fluctuations by the finite number of galaxies @xmath85 ) .",
    "the error due to sample variance on a power spectrum measurement , averaged over a radial bin in @xmath26-space of width @xmath86 , is @xmath87 ( e.g. peacock & west 1992 ) .",
    "this expression is derived from the density of states and the volume of @xmath26-space enclosed by the radial bin .",
    "the initial factor of @xmath88 is due to the fact that the density field is real rather than complex , thus only half the modes are independent .",
    "( for a realistic survey geometry equation [ eqerr ] is only an approximation , as neighbouring @xmath26-modes are correlated ) .",
    "figure [ figpkmod ] indicates that for a statistically significant measurement of the acoustic peak at @xmath89 mpc@xmath18 we require @xmath90 as the fractional height of this peak is about 4 per cent . thus taking @xmath91 mpc@xmath18 ( @xmath92 ) we find that @xmath93 .",
    "the number of galaxies needed to render shot noise negligible in this case is @xmath94 ( assuming @xmath95 and using the input model power spectrum to read off @xmath96 mpc@xmath82 at @xmath89 mpc@xmath18 ) .",
    "we constructed detailed simulations to determine the scale of survey required to measure the oscillation wavescale @xmath27 with a given accuracy .",
    "when measuring a power spectrum from a realistic survey , the quantity we derive is actually the power spectrum convolved with the survey window function in @xmath26-space , @xmath97 , the fourier transform of the window function in real space . to detect baryonic oscillations",
    "it is important that @xmath97 is compact ( non - zero only for @xmath98 ) , otherwise the smoothing effect of the convolution seriously reduces the amplitude of the oscillations .",
    "this restricts us to relatively simple survey geometries .",
    "( any remaining convolution has no effect on the observed oscillation wavescale @xmath27 ) .",
    "we considered two different potential surveys : the first directed at redshift range @xmath99 and the second probing the range @xmath100 .",
    "these ranges are reasonable possibilities for future large - scale surveys .",
    "the lower - redshift survey could target either luminous star - forming galaxies via 3727@xmath101 [ oii ] emission , or luminous elliptical galaxies using absorption features such as the 4000@xmath101 continuum break .",
    "in either case , @xmath102 is a reasonable limit where these spectral features move out of optical wavebands . for the higher redshift survey ,",
    "the lyman break selection technique operates efficiently for @xmath103 as the 912@xmath101 break shifts through the optical @xmath104-band .",
    "both these redshift regimes have already been explored by small surveys of hundreds of galaxies ( e.g. le fevre et al .",
    "1995 , steidel et al . 1998 ) and it is now becoming feasible to extend these efforts to far larger surveys .    for each redshift range @xmath99 and @xmath103 we defined a survey volume @xmath84 by an angular patch on the sky of size @xmath105 .",
    "we varied the volume @xmath84 by changing @xmath106 such that @xmath107 in each case ( @xmath108 and @xmath109 respectively ) . for the @xmath76 survey we restricted the power spectrum measurements to the fourier range @xmath110 mpc@xmath18 , which encompasses the first two detectable acoustic peaks .",

    "we generated many different gaussian realizations of @xmath85 galaxies from the model @xmath9 within the survey volumes @xmath84 , using fast fourier transform techniques .",
    "for simplicity we assumed a constant selection function across the survey volume ( i.e. a constant galaxy number density ) .",
    "a more realistic flux - limited survey will detect galaxies with a varying redshift distribution @xmath124 , but optimal weighting techniques for deriving @xmath9 exist in this case ( feldman , kaiser & peacock 1994 ) .",
    "we also neglected the evolution of @xmath9 with redshift over the survey depth , fixing the model power spectrum at the mean redshift of the survey ( i.e. @xmath125 or @xmath126 ) .",
    "this approximation has a negligible effect on the results as we are only interested in the relative positions of the peaks and troughs in @xmath9 , which are independent of redshift .    for the @xmath76 survey we assumed a linear bias factor @xmath95 for the galaxies .",
    "the potential @xmath120 survey will most likely be targetted at lyman break galaxies , which are known to be strongly biased tracers of mass ( steidel et al . 1998 ) ; in this case we assumed a linear bias parameter @xmath127 .",
    "as noted above , the main effect of this assumption is to reduce by a factor @xmath59 the number of galaxies @xmath85 required to render shot noise negligible .",
    "we measured the ( noisy ) power spectrum of each gaussian realization using the standard method ( see e.g. hoyle et al .",

    "the baryon wiggles method uses a known ruler and is therefore independently sensitive to distortions in @xmath154 and @xmath168 , through the parallel and perpendicular components of the power spectrum ( although in this initial treatment we average the power spectrum over angles ) .",
    "numerically , this is equivalent to the _ absolute deviation _ from unity of the solid and dashed lines in figure [ figdistort ] .",
    "thus the `` lever arm '' for detecting any departures from @xmath6 is a factor @xmath172 higher at @xmath42 for our method and , in contrast to the alcock - paczynski test , it does not depend on small - scale non - linear clustering details .",
    "we simulated surveys in the redshift ranges @xmath99 and @xmath100 , as before , using the same measured ranges of @xmath26 and linear bias factors . in each case",
    "we defined the survey volume by a @xmath173 angular patch .",
    "this generated a volume @xmath174 for the @xmath76 survey and @xmath175 at @xmath148 .",
    "we assumed redshift catalogues of @xmath176 galaxies at @xmath141 and @xmath177 galaxies at @xmath120 , such that the measurements were not limited by shot noise .",
    "these examples are somewhat arbitrarily chosen , but are indicative of future large - scale redshift surveys .",
    "we selected the galaxies from a redshift distribution that populated the survey volume approximately uniformly .",
    "we allowed the baryon density to vary over the range @xmath178 ( centred on the result @xmath23 assumed in section [ seclammeas ] ) . for each corresponding power spectrum we generated a set of galaxy realizations and converted these to redshift catalogues supposing a `` true '' cosmology @xmath6 .",
    "we then re - measured @xmath9 for each realization for a range of `` assumed '' cosmologies , @xmath179 . there are some theoretical reasons to suppose @xmath180 , but we do not impose this restriction on our analysis ( caldwell 1999 ) .    for each assumed value of @xmath2 we used 400 different galaxy realizations to derive a distribution of fitted wavescales in @xmath26-space .",
    "if the assumed value of @xmath2 differs from the `` true '' cosmology @xmath6 , then the fitted wavescales will be distorted ( see figure [ figpkdist ] ) and their distribution will not be centred on the expected wavescale ( computed from eisenstein & hu 1998 , equation 26 ) . this allowed us to assign a likelihood to each value of @xmath2 , based on the position of the expected wavescale in the measured distribution .",
    "for example , 68 per cent of the fitted wavescales lie between the @xmath138 and @xmath139 percentiles of the measured distribution .",
    "thus if the expected wavescale lies at the @xmath138 percentile of the distribution , the value of @xmath2 is rejected with `` @xmath181 significance '' .",
    "likewise , if the expected wavescale lies at the @xmath182 percentile of the distribution , the value of @xmath2 is rejected with `` @xmath183 significance '' .",
    "figures [ figwmeasz1 ] and [ figwmeasz3 ] display the final results for the @xmath76 and @xmath120 surveys : @xmath181 and @xmath183 confidence levels for the value of @xmath2 as a function of @xmath16 . for the fiducial value of @xmath23 we can indeed measure @xmath2 to a @xmath181 accuracy of @xmath184 , bearing out our back - of - the - envelope calculation in section [ secwintro ] .",
    "this of course assumes the fiducial model @xmath6 ; the error bar will have some dependence on the `` true '' value of @xmath2 , which we do not investigate here .    for comparison",
    ", we extended the angular area of the simulated @xmath134 survey by a factor of five , generating @xmath185 galaxies over a volume @xmath186 . in this case",
    ", the wiggle wavescale and dark energy parameter can be measured with respective accuracies @xmath187 per cent and @xmath188 ( assuming @xmath23 ) .",
    "baryonic oscillations offer a measurement of the dark energy equation of state that complements other methods .",
    "the precision obtainable from the surveys simulated above , @xmath3 ( @xmath189% confidence ) , is comparable to that achieved by combining together all existing relevant observations .",
    "the current high - redshift supernovae data requires @xmath190 at @xmath191% confidence for a flat geometry ( garnavich et al .",
    "1998 ) , and the latest ( wmap ) cmb measurements , taken together with other datasets , imply @xmath192 at @xmath191% confidence ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) . moreover , if deviations are to be detected from the @xmath6 paradigm , observations are required at @xmath193 where we expect the corresponding cosmological effects to be strongest : universal expansion switches from deceleration to acceleration at this epoch .    a high - quality sample of 2000 high - redshift supernovae distributed from @xmath194 to @xmath195 , provided by the snap satellite ( aldering et al .",
    "2002 ; http://snap.lbl.gov ) , promises to measure a constant @xmath2 to a precision @xmath196 ( @xmath189% confidence ) and constrain its time variation .",
    "the latter is further improved when combined with the accurate measure of @xmath169 provided by planck satellite observations of the cmb ( frieman et al .",
    "the baryon oscillations and supernovae methods of probing the dark energy should powerfully complement each other .",
    "supernovae provide a `` standard candle '' approach ( i.e. a measurement of the luminosity distance ) , whereas baryon oscillations provide a `` standard rod '' approach , measuring this rod in both the transverse and radial directions .",
    "the transverse rod measures the angular diameter distance . in conventional cosmology and physics , luminosity distance and angular diameter distance are both related to @xmath197 in equation [ eqcosmo ] by @xmath198 factors .",
    "however , this is not true of all scenarios ; for an exotic alternative involving photons oscillating into undetectable light axions see cs ' aki et al .",
    "the baryonic oscillations additionally measure the standard rod radially , yielding a measurement of @xmath199 which is equivalent to the hubble parameter @xmath200 . to the best of our knowledge",
    "the baryonic oscillations provide the only direct route to @xmath200 at high redshift .",
    "the efficacy of the supernova approach is determined by how accurately systematic errors can be controlled .",
    "these systematic astrophysical effects include the possible presence of non - standard host galaxy extinction , the evolution of supernovae with redshift , the effect of gravitational lensing , and variable milky way dust extinction .",
    "it is important to correct the supernova magnitudes by a light - curve factor ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1997 ) and/or colour / spectrum factor ( riess et al . 1998 ) .",
    "in contrast , the acoustic oscillations method is not limited by systematic errors , but by statistical uncertainties due to sample size .    the two approaches also differ in their requirement of a local calibration . in the supernova method",
    ", cosmological parameters follow from the relative brightnesses of supernovae at different redshifts : hence the nearby supernova factory ( http://snfactory.lbl.gov ) plans a detailed study of several hundred low - redshift supernovae . in contrast , the measuring - rod length for the acoustic peaks is given directly by fundamental physics ( @xmath169 and @xmath201 ) and does not require additional observations at @xmath73 .",
    "the use of counts of galaxies or clusters as probes of dark energy also depends on understanding critical systematics such as the variation with redshift of the intrinsic number density of the objects , and the ability to identify systems of comparable mass at different redshifts .",
    "the approach presented here is essentially a geometrical method , similar in conception to the alcock - paczynski test .",
    "a classic application of the alcock - paczynski test is to small - scale galaxy clustering parallel and perpendicular to the line - of - sight ( ballinger et al . 1996 ) .",
    "however , in this case it is very difficult to distinguish the geometrical distortions imprinted by an incorrect cosmology from redshift - space distortions . in contrast ,",
    "baryonic oscillations probe clustering on much larger scales , where redshift - space distortions are insignificant .",
    "in our very empirical approach , the measurement of @xmath2 depends only on knowledge of the positions of the acoustic peaks and troughs in the power spectrum ( and not on the detailed shape and amplitude of the power spectrum ) .",
    "it is the positions of these peaks , our `` standard rod '' , which are the least model - dependent aspects of the power spectrum .",
    "detailed models exist for physics before recombination , tested by increasingly accurate observations of the cmb power spectrum .",
    "the subsequent physics governing the growth of structures lies firmly in the well - understood linear regime for the scales of interest .",
    "however , three important issues have been ignored in this initial investigation and will be considered in a future study ( see also seo & eisenstein , in prep . ) .",
    "the most important unexplored effect in the use of baryonic oscillations is the possible existence of more complicated galaxy biassing schemes ( a non - linear bias that may evolve with redshift ) .",
    "this said , linear scale - independent bias should not be a bad approximation on large scales ( e.g. peacock & dodds 1994 ) . secondly , we have restricted our attention to models with a constant , redshift - independent value of @xmath2 .",
    "our approach can be simply extended to constrain models of varying @xmath2 , such as the common parameterizations @xmath202 or @xmath203 which will be the subject of a future study .",
    "thirdly , we have neglected the uncertainty in the value of @xmath15 , which clouds precise knowledge of the expected positions of the acoustic peaks .",
    "it is easy to estimate the implications of uncertainty in @xmath15 for our method , assuming a `` true '' cosmology @xmath22 , @xmath6 .",
    "we saw in section [ secwintro ] that a shift @xmath204 produces a radial distortion ( in @xmath199 ) of @xmath205 per cent at @xmath42 . using equation [ eqcosmo ] , a similar distortion is produced by a shift @xmath206 .",
    "however , the sound horizon is also changed by @xmath207 per cent in the same sense ( using the fitting formula of eisenstein & hu 1998 , equation 26 ) , thus the effects largely cancel out . the `` overall '' radial distortion ( relative to the sound horizon ) becomes 2 per cent when @xmath208 , which is reassuring : combining the wmap cmb results with other astronomical data sets produces a current measurement of @xmath15 with accuracy @xmath209 ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) , and this situation should improve in the light of new data .",
    "however , the @xmath148 survey demands much tighter knowledge of @xmath15 than the @xmath141 survey , because the @xmath210 term inside the @xmath157 in equation [ eqcosmo ] starts heavily winning and the distortion due to a shift in @xmath2 decreases .",
    "the result is that at @xmath122 , the shift @xmath211 produces the same overall radial distortion as @xmath204 .",
    "thus the application of this method at @xmath122 requires more accurate knowledge of @xmath15 than is achievable from current data .",
    "it is worth considering whether an imaging survey using photometric redshifts could accurately measure the acoustic peaks ( see also eisenstein 2002 ) .",
    "let us introduce a gaussian scatter @xmath212 in each galaxy redshift .",
    "this corresponds to a smearing in co - moving co - ordinates of magnitude @xmath213 . taking a concrete example , if @xmath214 ( a realistic estimate of the best possible current accuracy of photometric redshifts , e.g. wolf et al . 2003 ) then @xmath215 mpc at @xmath216 .",
    "the effect on a spherically symmetric @xmath9 in ( @xmath217,@xmath218,@xmath219)-space is a damping of all modes by a factor @xmath220 ( in the flat - sky approximation ) , where the @xmath40-axis is the line - of - sight . considering the modes in a spherical shell of radius @xmath221 mpc@xmath18 ,",
    "the majority are too heavily damped to provide signal .",
    "the surviving useful modes ( with @xmath222 mpc@xmath18 ) are located within a `` ring '' in @xmath26-space , corresponding to a reduction in the number of useful modes by a factor @xmath223 . to achieve the same power spectrum precision on this scale @xmath26 , the sky area of the imaging survey ( i.e. density of states in @xmath26-space )",
    "must be increased by this same factor @xmath224 such that the ring contains the same number of modes as the original spherical shell .",
    "however , the most significant disadvantage of the photometric redshifts approach is one loses the capacity to decompose the power spectrum into its radial and tangential components , which separately constrain the hubble constant and angular diameter distance through distortions in @xmath168 and @xmath154 ( eisenstein 2002 ) . in our initial `` proof - of - concept '' treatment , we have averaged the power spectrum over angles and not pursued these separate constraints , which certainly merit more detailed calculation ( see seo & eisenstein , in prep . ) .",
    "as noted above , the radial component of @xmath9 is damped by a factor @xmath225 , which becomes unacceptably small unless @xmath226 or ( taking @xmath221 mpc@xmath18 ) @xmath227 at @xmath216 .",
    "spectroscopic resolution @xmath228 is thus required for sufficiently accurate redshifts .",
    "finally , how realistic is it to carry out such redshift surveys in practice ?",
    "our simulated surveys involve @xmath229 galaxies over @xmath145 deg@xmath79 of sky .",
    "the exposure times for spectra of these objects would be of order 12 hours on 8-metre class telescopes , based on existing data ( e.g. steidel et al .",
    "an 8-metre telescope with a @xmath230 diameter field of view , capable of taking spectra of up to 3000 galaxies simultaneously , could accomplish such a survey in 60120 nights .",
    "such an instrument is eminently feasible and has been proposed several times ( glazebrook 2002 ) . in particular , a detailed concept design has been put together for the gemini telescopes ( barden 2002 ) . the observing time and",
    "data volume of such a survey is very similar to that of the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( colless et al .",
    "this initial study has demonstrated that , under a simple set of assumptions , baryonic oscillations in the galaxy power spectrum may be used to measure accurately the equation of state of the dark energy . for example , a survey of three times the sloan volume at mean redshift @xmath76 can measure the sound horizon ( i.e. the wiggle scale ) with an accuracy of 2 per cent , and the parameter @xmath2 ( assumed constant ) with precision @xmath204 , assuming @xmath23 .",
    "this probe of the dark energy is complementary to the supernova method , with an entirely different set of uncertainties dominated by sample size rather than systematic effects",
    ". it would provide the second independent pillar of evidence for the current epoch acceleration of the universal expansion .",
    "the constraints on @xmath2 become tighter as the survey volume is enlarged .",
    "we conclude that delineation of the baryonic peaks , and their use as a standard cosmological ruler to constrain cosmological parameters , should form an important scientific motivation for the next generation of galaxy redshift surveys .",
