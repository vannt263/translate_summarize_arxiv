    "recently , in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) the first moments of the transverse polarized structure function @xmath0 have been measured @xcite . among the leading twist-2",
    "part @xmath0 contains a non - power suppressed twist-3part , which it is intended to measure + cern - th/97 - 4 + january 1997    at hermes and the smc .",
    "although at present the statistic is too low to extract the evolution of the twist-2 part of @xmath0 with respect to the momentum transfer @xmath1 , it may be important for future high - precision measurements to know the theoretical prediction also for the twist-3 part .",
    "this higher - twist contribution is in fact expressed in terms of three particle operators sandwiched between the polarized nucleon state ; therefore , it possesses no simple parton interpretation .",
    "furthermore , also for ( higher - twist ) operators with fixed spin there remains a mixing problem due to the renormalization .",
    "consequently , the evolution equation is no longer of the type of a dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) equation .",
    "introducing so - called qausi - partonic operators , bukhvostov , kuraev and lipatov derived evolution equations for higher - twist correlation functions and computed the twist-3 evolution kernels and the anomalous dimensions for both the non - singlet and the singlet channels @xcite .",
    "their non - singlet result was confirmed in the axial gauge as well as in the covariant gauge by different authors using quite different techniques .",
    "the results in @xcite coincide with the original result ; however , in @xcite the transposed local anomalous dimension matrix was obtained .",
    "recently , two more independent calculations @xcite support the bukhvostov , kuraev and lipatov result .",
    "it should be mentioned that special emphasis was given in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) to the equation of motion ( eom ) operators . as is expected from the renormalization properties of gauge - invariant operators @xcite , the result obtained in the off - shell scheme coincides with the previous ones in which the mixing with the eom operators was neglected from the beginning of the calculation . in the minimal subtraction scheme",
    "this result is obvious at leading order .",
    "however , beyond the leading order it is not excluded that a non - proper regularization of infrared singularities spoils the general renormalization principles .    here",
    "we apply an appropriate technique , which is based on the non - local operator product expansion introduced by anikin and zavialov @xcite and the renormalization group equation for light - ray operators @xcite . for several years geyer , robaschik and",
    "others applied this approach to the calculation of leading twist non - forward evolution equations @xcite relevant for deeply inelastic compton scattering and , more recently , for the forward twist-3 non - singlet channel @xcite .",
    "a similar approach was independently developed by balitzky and braun @xcite and among other studies , applied to the one - loop calculation of the non - forward twist-3 singlet channel .",
    "although the singlet result @xcite coincides with the local anomalous dimension matrix given in @xcite ( up to obvious misprints in both papers ) it is desired to have a third independent calculation .",
    "on the other hand it is also theoretically interesting to study the evolution of power - suppressed contributions . calculating the first few moments of twist-4 operators , a first step in this direction was done in @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that also one - loop order calculations are cumbersome and will be more difficult for increasing twist .",
    "thus , it would be desired to have an algorithm that allows the use of computer power .",
    "such an algorithm will be given in this paper for light - ray operators .",
    "applying the non - local operator product expansion @xcite the structure functions for dis are factorized in coefficient functions and forward matrix elements of light - ray operators . the well - known result for the longitudinal structure function @xmath2 reads in leading order @xmath3 the quark distribution functions ( containing quark and antiquark ) are defined as matrix elements of leading twist-2 operators : @xmath4 where the renormalization point @xmath5 of the operator is set equal to the momentum transfer @xmath6 .",
    "the twist-2 operators are defined as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a light - like vector . here and in the following we apply for simplicity the light - cone gauge , i.e. @xmath9 .",
    "a gauge invariant definition in a general gauge is obtained by including a path - ordered link factor .",
    "the operator product analysis to leading order suggests that the structure function @xmath10 can be written in the form of a generalized wandzura - wilczek relation @xcite : @xmath11 so that the burkhardt - cottingham sum rule @xcite , i.e. @xmath12 , is obviously fulfilled . here",
    "@xmath13 is decomposed in the twist-2 part given by @xmath2 and a remaining , not - power suppressed , twist-3 part @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the twist-3 contribution @xmath15 can now be formally expressed as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the polarization vector and the twist-3 light - ray operator is defined as @xmath18 \\gamma^5       d^{\\sigma}(u,\\kappa_1\\tilde{x},\\kappa_2\\tilde{x } )        \\psi_q(\\kappa_2 \\tilde{x } ) , \\\\",

    "the gluon field lies between the two quark fields . because of the support property @xmath27 , the variable @xmath25",
    "is then restricted to @xmath28 and can be interpreted as an effective momentum fraction .",

    "the moments with respect to @xmath41 correspond to matrix elements of operators with definite spin @xmath42 , so that their evolution equation will be diagonal with respect to @xmath42 .",
    "however , for the remaining mixing problem there is no known analytical solution . in two limits for @xmath43 and ( only in the non - singlet channel ) also in the large @xmath44 limit , the evolution equation for @xmath45 reduces to an equation of the dglap type @xcite .    in the singlet channel",
    ", there appears a mixing problem .",

    "the relevant feynman diagrams for the calculation of the evolution kernel to leading order are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "in addition to the one - particle irreducible diagrams , the application of the equation of motion can be represented by reducible diagrams @xcite . in the following",
    "we describe shortly the computational calculation of the twist-3 evolution kernels in the light - cone gauge .",
    "the applied method can be easily modified for a covariant gauge and can be extended to twist higher than 3 .",
    "because of the light - cone gauge all operator vertices @xmath49 have only a pure exponential @xmath50-dependence . here",
    "@xmath51 includes the lorentz , flavour , and colour structure of the operator .",
    "however , the gluon propagator contains a spurious pole : @xmath52 which will be regularized by the leibbrandt - mandelstam prescription @xcite : @xmath53 with the dual light - like vector @xmath54 , i.e. @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the dirac algebra can be performed with one of the usual high - energy programs ( such as form , feyncalc or tracer ) .",
    "the integration over the loop momentum and the final simplification of the result were done with a rule - based program written in mathematica .",
    "after cancellation of common scalar products between numerator and denominator , as well as the decomposition of @xmath57 , each diagram is expressed in terms of the following dimensional regularized tensor integrals : @xmath58 with the help of the + -prescription @xmath59 the integral @xmath60 can be decomposed in @xmath61 where @xmath62 contains no more spurious poles .",
