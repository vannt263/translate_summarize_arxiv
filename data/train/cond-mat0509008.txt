    "_ all collinear ground states have the same generic zero modes_.    \\(a ) ( b )    zero modes mean that the quadratic correction to the classical energy due to small deviations from collinear order vanishes .",
    "it is interesting to note , that the zero modes associated with loops that have alternating classical spins @xmath34 , are modes associated with the transformations under which @xmath24 is invariant .",
    "in fact , deviations that rotate spins along these loops by any angle @xmath19 take a collinear state to a non - collinear classical ground state , and when @xmath115 , the rotation takes one collinear classical ground state to another .",

    "for any such mode @xmath117 , the diamond lattice vector @xmath118 is an eigenvector of @xmath119 with the same eigenvalue @xmath120 in this fashion , we can get rid of @xmath110 generic zero modes by projecting to a space that lives on the diamond lattice sites only , and is orthogonal to all generic zero modes . as already noted , since the generic zero modes are the same for all states , we can consistently disregard them and limit ourselves solely to diamond lattice eigenmodes of eq .",

    "we will find , in the following section , that these are modes that have divergent fluctuations .      as is apparent in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fluct ] ) , divergent harmonic fluctuations occur whenever a certain mode @xmath123 satisfies @xmath124 this can be shown to occur if and only if @xmath85 is not diagonalizable , i.e. , when the jordan form of the matrix has a block of order 2 .",
    "@xmath125 we call the mode @xmath126 , which is a zero mode of @xmath83 , but not an eigenmode of @xmath85 , a _ divergent zero mode_. as we noted before , a more accurate description would be to refer to the pair of conjugate operators @xmath127 , @xmath128 as the quantum mechanical divergent mode .",

    "the mode is constructed in the following way : in addition to @xmath13 , one other , freely chosen , ( even ) nearest neighbor @xmath135 of @xmath132 must be in the support of @xmath130 . if the bond connecting @xmath13 and @xmath135 is satisfied ( antiferromagnetic ) @xmath136",

    "even and odd divergent modes are linearly independent from each other , and any divergent modes can be separated to a sum of an even divergent mode and an odd divergent mode , and since odd and even modes are linearly independent from each other , one can construct a real - space basis for divergent modes from the single - sublattice divergent modes .",
    "\\(a ) ( b )    if we examine the rules of constructing real space divergent modes , we find that their support ( on the diamond lattice ) can either be unbounded in space , or bounded along _ only one _ of the major axes , as in fig .",

    "this can be easily proved : suppose that an even divergent mode is bounded in the @xmath66 direction .",

[ sec : model ] they referred to spin directions .",
    "the site @xmath13 has an odd neighbor at @xmath139 ( where the lattice constant of the underlying cubic lattice is taken to be @xmath76 ) , that has two ( even ) neighbors at @xmath140 ( and thus can not be in the support of the mode ) , and two neighbors at @xmath141 .",

    "our discussion so far has focused on spin waves in real space , and has therefore been applicable to any ( even non - periodic ) classical collinear ground state .",

    "upon diagonalization , we obtain that the number of bands in the brillouin zone is equal to the number of sites in the magnetic unit cell , i.e. the number of sublattices .",
    "the bands can be classified as follows : half of the energy bands belong to generic zero modes , which have vanishing energy throughout the brillouin zone .",

    "since the divergent modes are bounded , at most , in one direction , the fourier space basis is constructed by taking linear combinations of bounded planar modes , which are localized modes along the ( major ) axis normal to the plane .",
