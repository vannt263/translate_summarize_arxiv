    "qcd is the underlying theory of strong interaction , which has three fundamental properties : asymptotic freedom , confinement , and approximate chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking .",
    "perturbative qcd has been tested to very high accuracy .",
    "but the low energy sector of qcd ( i.e. , hadron physics ) still remains very challenging .",
    "precision - test of standard model and search for new physics require good knowledge of hadrons as inputs such as parton distribution functions , hadron distribution amplitudes etc .",
    "the motion and interaction of hadrons differ from those of nuclei and elementary particles like quarks , gluons , leptons and gauge bosons .",
    "hadron physics is the bridge between nuclear physics and particle physics .",
    "the famous higgs mechanism contributes around 20 mev to the nucleon mass through current quark mass .",
    "nearly all the mass of the visible matter in our universe comes from the non - perturbative qcd interaction",
    ". therefore study of hadron spectroscopy explores the mechanism of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking , and the mass origin .",
    "quark model is quite successful in the classification of hadrons although it s not derived from qcd .",
    "any state with quark content other than @xmath0 or @xmath1 is beyond the naive quark model .",
    "but quark model ca nt be the whole story .",
    "qcd may allow much richer hadron spectrum such as glueballs , hybrid mesons / baryons , multiquark states , hadron molecules .",
    "although experimental search of these non - conventional states started many years ago , none of them has been established without controversy experimentally !    typical signatures of these non - conventional states include :    * exotic flavor quantum number like @xmath2 * exotic @xmath3 quantum number like @xmath4 exotic meson * overpopulation of the qm spectrum like the scalar isoscalar spectrum below 1.9 gev : @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 .    in this talk",
    "i will review the recent progress on the p - wave charmed mesons in the past several years , especially @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "i will also discuss the important progress on the charmonium and charmonium - like system including x(3872 ) , x(3940 ) , y(3940 ) , y(4260 ) , z(3930 ) etc .",
    "interested readers may consult the recent review on new hadron states @xcite .",
    "heavy quark expansion provides a systematic method to deal with hadrons with a single heavy quark .",
    "the angular momentum @xmath16 of the light quark in the @xmath17 system is a good quantum number in the heavy quark limit .",
    "heavy mesons form doublets with different @xmath16 and parity . for @xmath18",
    ", we have the ground doublet @xmath19 . for the @xmath20 p - wave states",
    ", we have two doublets : @xmath21 , @xmath22 . the @xmath19 and @xmath22 doublets agree with theoretical expectation quite well .",
    "in contrast , there are two puzzles with the @xmath21 doublet .",
    "the heavy - light system is the qcd `` hydrogen '' !    the non - strange @xmath21 doublet decay through s - wave .",
    "they are very broad with a width around 300 mev .",
    "the non - strange @xmath23 doublet decay through d - wave .",
    "they are narrow with a width around 20 mev .",
    "there was one measurement of the @xmath24 mass from belle collaboration @xmath25 mev with a large width @xmath26 mev @xcite , where we use the star to indicate this @xmath24 state belongs to the @xmath21 doublet . for the @xmath27 state , there were two measurements .",
    "focus collaborations reported @xmath28 mev with a width @xmath29 mev @xcite while belle observed it at @xmath30 mev with a width @xmath31 mev @xcite .    for the strange doublet",
    ", we have @xmath32 mev , @xmath33 mev @xcite . @xmath34 and @xmath35 lie below dk ( d*k ) threshold .",
    "they are roughly 160 mev below quark model prediction @xcite .",
    "both of them are extremely narrow .",
    "their strong decays violate isospin symmetry and occur with help of a virtual @xmath36 meson : @xmath37 .",
    "the mass of @xmath38 from three lattice qcd simulations is still larger than experimental value @xcite .",
    "naively one would expect that @xmath14 lies 100 mev above @xmath12 because of the mass difference between strange and up quarks .",
    "now arise the two puzzles : ( 1 ) why is the mass of @xmath39 so low ?",
    "( 2 ) why are @xmath34 and @xmath40 nearly degenerate ?",
    "the low mass of @xmath39 inspired various tetraquark schemes .",
    "for example , if @xmath40 and @xmath34 were in the anti - symmetric @xmath41 multiplet , their flavor wave functions are @xcite @xmath42 @xmath43 since they contain the same amount of strange , they would have roughly the same mass .",
    "but tetraquarks always contain the color - singlet times color - singlet component in their color wave function .",
    "they would fall apart easily and become very broad .",
    "there always exist two difficult issues for the tetraquark interpretation : ( 1 ) where are the conventional @xmath21 states in the quark model ? ( 2 ) where are those partner states in the same tetraquark multiplet ?",
    "in fact , babar collaboration scanned around 2.31 gev , 2.46 gev and below 2.7 gev .",
    "not surprisingly , they found neither additional @xmath21 states nor their spin - flavor partner states .",
    "belle , babar and cleo collaborations measured the ratio of radiative and strong decay widths of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , which is collected in table [ tab - ratio ] .",
    ".comparison between experimental ratio of @xmath44 radiative and strong decay widths and theoretical predictions from light - cone qcd sum rule approach.[tab - ratio ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     however y(4260 ) was not seen in the @xmath45 annihilation .",
    "in fact , r distribution dips around 4.26 gev .",
    "its leptonic width is small : @xmath46 ev @xcite and its hidden charm decay width is large : @xmath47 mev !    according to the pdg assignment of the @xmath48 charmonium , there are four s - wave states @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and two d - wave states @xmath53 , @xmath54",
    ". naively one would expect the @xmath55 state lying above 4.4 gev .",
    "in other words , there is no suitable place for y(4260 ) in the quark model spectrum .",
    "all the above states have a sharp peak in r distribution . but",
    "y(4260 ) has a dip !",
    "the discovery of y(4260 ) indicates the overpopulation of the @xmath48 spectrum if pdg classification of the observed @xmath48 charmonium is correct .    from bes and cleoc s recent measurement , the hidden charm decay width of @xmath56 : @xmath57 kev @xcite . if y(4260 ) is a charmonium state , one might expect a comparable @xmath58 decay width instead of @xmath59 mev .",
    "similar di - pion transitions from @xmath51 or @xmath54 were not observed in the same experiments .",
    "one may wonder whether the conventional charmonium assignment is in trouble .",
    "virtual photon does not couple to glues directly and glueballs easily decay into light hadrons which were not observed experimentally .",
    "so y(4260 ) does not look like a glueball .",
    "although it lies close to @xmath60 , @xmath61 or @xmath62 thresholds , y(4260 ) does not seem to arise from the threshold or coupled - channel effects since the @xmath58 spectrum is very symmetric .",
    "there is no obvious distortion from nearby thresholds .",
    "could y(4260 ) be a tetraquark ?",
    "tetraquark falls apart into @xmath63 very easily .",
    "so @xmath64 should be one of the dominant decay modes",
    ". its width would be much larger than 90 mev ! moreover , if the isoscalar component of the photon had produced y(4260 ) with @xmath65 , its isovector componet would also have produced @xmath66 with @xmath67 , which decays into @xmath68 .",
    "this possibility had been ruled out by babar collaboration @xcite !    several groups suggested that y(4260 ) may be a a hybrid charmonium in 2005 @xcite .",
    "its mass leptonic width , total width , production cross section , decay pattern ( hidden charm vs open charm ) , flavor blind decays into @xmath58 and @xmath69 , overpopulation of @xmath48 spectrum and its large hidden charm decay width satisfy the very naive expectation of a hybrid charmonium state .",
    "it s very interesting to recall that quigg and rosner predicted one @xmath48 charmonium state at 4233 mev using the logarithmic potential thirty years ago , which was identified as the 4s state @xcite . in order to study possible effects of color screening and large string tension in heavy quarkonium spectra , ding , chao , and",
    "qin also predicted their 4s charmonium state exactly at 4262 mev twelve years ago @xcite ! their potential is quite simple : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the string tension and @xmath72 is the screening parameter .",
    "with such a perfect agreement , one may wonder whether pdg assignment misses one @xmath48 charmonium state in the quark model . or",
    "does the same traditional quark potential hold for higher states far above strong decay threshold ?",
    "however , two serious challenges remain for the conventional quark model interpretation : ( 1 ) how to generate the huge @xmath58 decay width ? ( 2 ) how to explain the dip in the r distribution ?",
    "after four years extensive theoretical and experimental efforts , the situation of @xmath73 mesons is almost clear : both @xmath74 and @xmath75 are probably @xmath76 states .",
    "but the higher charmonium sector is still very controversial    * z(3930 ) is very probably @xmath77 * x(3940 ) may be @xmath78 * y(3940 ) needs confirmation * x(3872 ) may be a candidate of @xmath79 ( or molecule ) * y(4260 ) may be a candidate of hybrid charmonium ( or charmonium ) .",
    "besiii in beijing will start taking data this year and will increase its database by 100 times .",
    "jlab , b factories and other facilities are increasing the database continuously .",
    "j - parc will start running at the end of next year .",
    "there will be great progress in the search of non - conventional hadrons and more unexpected ...",
