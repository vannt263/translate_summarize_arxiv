    "axially symmetric solutions of a theory of gravitation are of great interest because of its astrophysical applications , e.g. they can model spiral galaxies @xcite and accretion disks around compact structures @xcite . there is a vast literature on analytical general relativistic self - gravitating disk models and extensions to modified theories of gravity .",
    "the first general relativistic solutions were obtained by bonnor and sackfield @xcite , representing a thin disk of matter without stress .",
    "morgan and morgan studied thin disks with transverse stress @xcite and with radial stress @xcite .",
    "kuzmin - like thin disks in general relativity were constructed by bik , lynden - bell and katz @xcite and vogt and letelier @xcite , among others .",
    "an extension of the simplest kuzmin - like disk presented in @xcite to six - dimensional gravity was proposed in @xcite . for a survey on analytical thin - disk models in both general relativity and newtonian gravitation , see @xcite .",
    "relativistic thick disks extending the miyamoto - nagai model @xcite were proposed in @xcite and @xcite , with a six - dimensional counterpart presented in @xcite .",
    "spiral galaxies present a myriad of rotation curve profiles @xcite .",
    "models based on newtonian gravity are not able to reproduce these profiles by considering only the corresponding density profiles inferred by photometry .",
    "also , an appropriate full general relativistic formulation of the above problem is still an open question .",
    "the current explanation for these and other astrophysical phenomena is the presence of dark matter halos ( @xcite , see @xcite for a comprehensive review of the dark matter paradigm and @xcite for a detailed historical overview of the subject ) , although recent work on quantum corrections to general relativity has given results as good as the dark matter framework ( pseudoisothermal halo ) , at least in spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this discrepancy led many scientists to investigate whether the effect of modifications of the law of gravity on large scales could solve the `` missing mass '' problem ( see @xcite for a modification of gravity which deals with rotation curves of spiral galaxies and @xcite for a thorough review of the mond framework ) .",
    "however , so far no modification of the law of gravitation was able to explain these `` missing matter '' phenomena in all scales .    concerning modified theories of gravity based on generalizations of the geometrical concept of spacetime , hermann weyl presented in 1918 a generalization of riemannian geometry in an attempt to give a unified theory of gravitation and electromagnetism @xcite .",
    "his idea was based on the association of the electromagnetic 4-potential @xmath1 with the nonmetricity of spacetime .",
    "after some criticisms regarding the non - integrability of length in his theory the idea was abandoned @xcite , reappearing later ( in a cosmological context ) in a work of dirac @xcite .",

    "a recent review on the applications of weyl geometry to gravitation and quantum mechanics is presented in @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to construct analytical thin - disk models in the integrable weyl - dirac theory proposed by israelit @xcite and to compare its observables with the corresponding gr ones obtained by the same procedure .",
    "apart from matter creation itself @xcite , it is of extreme importance to analyze the motion of astrophysical bodies under the influence of the background fields generated by gravity and geometry , such as the motions of stars in a spiral galaxy .",
    "our main goal in this paper is to compare the rotation curves and density profiles predicted by the present model to the corresponding general relativistic model , and see whether they are consistent with observations without the introduction of dark matter halos",
    ". applications of israelit s weyl - dirac ( w - d ) theory to cosmology are presented in @xcite , and to spherically symmetric spacetimes in @xcite . as far as we know , the present paper is the first attempt to obtain exact solutions of an integrable w - d theory which model galactic disks , as well as to analyze the behavior of test particles in a given background of @xcite ( applications of the original non - integrable w - d theory @xcite to galactic rotation curves are presented in @xcite ) .",

    "as far as we know , the possible physical origins of these new charges @xmath165 and @xmath166 for ordinary matter remain unclear . nevertheless , we consider the results presented here a first step towards a definitive answer for the above issues .    however , it is valuable to remark that the family of solutions obtained from the spherically symmetric solution in vacuum @xcite has the property that for arbitrarily close rotation curves there are many possible density and pressure profiles , a situation that does not arise neither in the newtonian kuzmin model @xcite nor in its general relativistic extension @xcite .",
    "the existence of a variety of kuzmin - type disks with virtually the same rotation curve and very qualitatively different density profiles , as presented in section [ rcdp ] , is a particular feature of the weyl - dirac theory studied here .",
    "it occurs because the vacuum spherically symmetric solution of the theory in the gauge @xmath93 ( buchdahl s solution @xcite ) , used as an `` image charge '' for the construction of the present disk , introduces new parameters besides the schwarzschild - like parameter @xmath52 .",
    "also , this theory allows the existence of an _ exact _ matching between rotation curves whose corresponding density profiles may be completely different .",
    "these configurations may be obtained , for instance , by a suitable gauge transformation applied to the gr kuzmin model @xcite .",
    "this situation is very different from newtonian gravitation , in which the density profile of a razor - thin disk and its corresponding circular velocity profile are in a one - to - one correspondence ( see @xcite , section 2.6.2 ) . in this way",
    ", the obtention of the appropriate gauge function @xmath0 for galactic scales is mandatory , as well as physical constraints on the charge @xmath165  and , as a consequence , on @xmath166  which determines the equations of motion for test particles ( [ eqmovisr ] ) .",
