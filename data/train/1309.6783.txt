    "redshift - space distortions ( rsd ) of galaxy clustering , which appear as systematic effects in determining the redshift of each galaxy via spectroscopic measurements and manifestly break statistical isotropy @xcite , are now recognized as a sensitive probe of the growth of structure . combining the distance measurement of galaxies using the baryon acoustic oscillations as standard ruler ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ", rsd offers a unique opportunity to test the theory of gravity on cosmological scales ( e.g. , @xcite ) and help us obtain a deeper understanding of the current accelerating expansion of the universe .",
    "this is indeed one of the main goal of on - going and up - coming galaxy surveys such as the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey of sloan digital sky survey iii , the wigglez survey , the subaru measurement of imaging and redshifts , the dark energy survey , the bigboss project , and the esa / euclid survey , which will provide precision measurements of the power spectrum ( or correlation function )",
    ". the late - time cosmic acceleration , first discovered by the observations of distant type ia supernovae @xcite , may be the result of a dark energy which can be realized in the presence of dynamical scalar field , or it may indicate the breakdown of general relativity ( gr ) on cosmological scales .",
    "the latter case requires a consistent model of gravity that explains the accelerating expansion on large scales with the modification of gravity , while neatly evading the stringent constraints on the deviation from gr at solar system scales ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this respect ,",
    "the large - scale structure offers the best opportunity to distinguish between modified gravity and dark energy models in gr , and the measurement of rsd is a powerful tool to probe gravity .",
    "given the high - precision measurements of rsd in the near future , accurate theoretical templates of the redshift - space power spectrum or correlation function is highly demanded in order to detect a small deviation of gravity from gr .",
    "this is indeed now active research subject , and there are many studies to accurately model rsd .",
    "the rsd measurement is basically made at the scales close to the linear regime of gravitational evolution , but the nonlinearity arising both from the gravity and the rsd is known to play a crucial role .",
    "moreover , due to the non - gaussian nature of rsd @xcite , the applicable range of linear theory prediction is fairly narrower than that in real space .",
    "thus , beyond the linear scales , a sophisticated treatment is required for reliable theoretical predictions with a wider applicable range .",
    "recently , based on the perturbation theory of large - scale structure , several improved models of rsd have been proposed @xcite",
    ". these models properly account for the non - gaussian nature of rsd , and are tested against @xmath1-body simulations , successfully describing redshift - space power spectrum and/or correlation function at weakly nonlinear regime .",
    "applying these models to real observations , constraints on the growth of structure have been also obtained ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that the proposed models of rsd have been so far tested only in the case of gr .",
    "further , beyond linear theory , the template of rsd is computed with the perturbation theory under the assumption that gravity is described by gr .",
    "thus , the observational constraints derived from the pt - based template can be only used as a consistency test with gr , and a care must be taken in addressing the constraint on a specific model of modified gravity .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to examine these issues based on an improved model of rsd developed by ref .  @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum expression of this model is similar to the one proposed by ref .",
    "@xcite and the so - called streaming model frequently used in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but it includes two important pt corrections as a result of the low-@xmath2 expansion .",
    "although the model also includes a phenomenological term to account for the finger - of - god damping arising from the small - scale physics , combining the recently developed resummed pt , it successfully describes not only the matter but also the halo power spectra in @xmath1-body simulations @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the model can be used as a theoretical template to simultaneously constrain the parameters associated with the cosmic expansion and the structure growth in an unbiased manner , and applying it to the luminous red galaxy sample of sloan digital sky survey data release 7 , a robust contraint is obtained @xcite .    here , extending these previous works in gr , we put forward a prescription to compute the redshift - space power spectrum in modified gravity models .",
    "as a specific example , we explicitly compute the redshift - space power spectrum in @xmath0 gravity model , as one of the representative modified theory of gravity @xcite . the theoretical prediction based on the standard pt calculation",
    "is compared with the results of @xmath1-body simulations , and a good agreement is found .",
    "then , we will discuss the potential impact of the precision modeling of rsd on the model - independent test of gr and/or constraint on modified gravity models .",
    "we will show that a tight and unbiased constraint on modified gravity models is achieved only with an improved pt model of rsd in which the effect of modified gravity is properly taken into account in the pt calculation . with the improved pt template ,",
    "testing gr will be made possible in a model - independent way , but we argue that a quantitative characterization of the small deviation from gr generally requires a prior knowledge of modified gravity models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : rsd_model ] , we begin by briefly reviewing the model of rsd proposed by ref .  @xcite . employing the standard pt calculation",
    ", we then give a prescription on how to compute the redshift - space power spectrum in modified gravity models . in appendix",

    "sec : rsd_frmodel ] , as one of the representative models of modified gravity , we consider the @xmath0 gravity model , and quantitatively compare the pt predictions in redshift space with @xmath1-body simulations . based on this , in sec .",
    "[ sec : implications ] , a potential impact of the precision pt model of rsd is discussed , particularly focusing on a precision constraint on the model parameter of modified gravity , and model - independent analysis of detecting or characterizing a small deviation from gr .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to the summary and conclusion .",
    "we begin by writing the exact expression for redshift - space power spectrum .",
    "let us denote the density and velocity fields by @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "owing to the distant - observer approximation , which is usually valid for the observation of distant galaxies of our interest , one can write ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the separation in real space and @xmath7 indicates an ensemble average . in the above expression , the @xmath8-axis is taken as an observer s line - of - sight direction , and we define the directional cosine @xmath9 by @xmath10 .",
    "further , we defined @xmath11 , and @xmath12 for the line - of - sight component of the velocity field .",
    "note that the above expression has been derived without invoking the dynamical information for velocity and density fields , i.e. , the euler equation and/or continuity equations .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ eq : pkred_exact ] ) does hold even in modified gravity models .",
    "( [ eq : pkred_exact ] ) can be re - expressed in terms of the cumulants .",
    "then , the term in the bracket is factorized into two terms , each of which includes the exponential factor ( e.g. , see eq.(6 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite for explicit expression ) . among these , the overall factor , expressed as @xmath13 with @xmath14 being the cumulant , is responsible for the suppression of the power spectrum arising mostly from the virialized random and coherent motion on small scales .",
    "the effect of this is known to be partly non - perturbative , and seems difficult to treat petrubatively . since it has been shown to mainly change the broadband shape of the power spectrum",
    ", we may phenomenologically characterize it with a general functional form @xmath15 with @xmath16 being a scale - independent constant . on the other hand ,",
    "the remaining factor includes the term leading to the kaiser effect in the linear regime @xcite , and is likely to affect the structure of power spectrum on large - scales .",
    "although there also appears the exponential factor @xmath17 in each term of this factor , these contributions should be small as long as we consider the large scales , and the perturbative treatment may be applied .    with the proposition given above , ref .",
    "@xcite applied the low-@xmath2 expansion , keeping the overall prefactor as general functional form @xmath18 .",
    "the resultant power spectrum expression at one - loop order becomes @xmath19\\ , \\nonumber\\\\ & \\quad\\times\\,\\bigl\\ { p_{\\rm kaiser}(k,\\mu)+a(k,\\mu)+b(k,\\mu ) \\bigr\\ } ,   \\label{eq : tns_model}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which we hereafter call tns model .",
    "owing to the single - stream approximation in which the dynamics of large - scale structure is described by the density @xmath3 and velocity divergence @xmath20 , the quantities @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are explicitly written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 respectively denote auto - power spectra of density and velocity divergence , and their cross power spectrum .",
    "the function @xmath28 is cross bispectrum defined by @xmath29 note that in deriving eq .",
    "( [ eq : tns_model ] ) , we do not assume any gravity model .",
    "although the expression ( [ eq : tns_model ] ) has been originally derived based on the consideration in gr , as long as the deviation from gr is small , eq .  ( [ eq : tns_model ] ) can apply to any model of modified gravity .    as we mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , the main characteristic of the model given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tns_model ] ) is the two additional terms @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which represent the higher - order coupling between velocity and density fields .",
    "it has been shown in previous studies in gr that these two terms enhance the power spectrum amplitude over the scales of baryon acoustic oscillations , and moderately but notably change the acoustic structure imprinted in the power spectrum @xcite . as a result",
    ", the model ( [ eq : tns_model ] ) successfully describes both the matter and halo power spectra of @xmath1-body simulations at weakly nonlinear scales @xcite .",
    "these features are expected to hold qualitatively even in the modified theory of gravity , but quantitative aspect of the rsd would generally differ from that of gr , which we will study in detail .      to compute the redshift - space power spectrum beyond linear theory",
    ", we apply the pt treatment of gravitational evolution , and calculate each term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tns_model ] ) in the quasilinear regime .",
    "while the power spectrum calculation in the case of gr has been made possible with resummed pt scheme up to the two - loop order ( e.g. , @xcite in redshift space , and @xcite in real space ) and the applicable range of the pt prediction has become wider , we here work with the standard pt calculation at one - loop order for the predictions in modified theory of gravity .",
    "although the standard pt treatment in gr is known to produce ill - behaved pt expansion that lacks good convergence properties ( e.g. , @xcite ) , using the standard pt as theoretical template , we can still get a fruitful cosmological constraint at the quasilinear scales ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the present paper ,",
    "we use the standard pt formalism developed by ref .",
    "@xcite , which is suited to deal with a wide class of modified gravity models . in",
    "what follows , we separately give a prescription on how to compute the power spectrum corrections in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tns_model ] ) .",
    "the term @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tns_model ] ) is the leading - order contribution to the redshift - space power spectrum . in the large - scale limit where the linear theory prediction is safely applied , we have @xmath30 , and eq .",
    "( [ eq : kaiser ] ) is reduced to the kaiser formula , @xmath31 @xcite , where @xmath32 is the linear growth rate defined by @xmath33 with @xmath34 being the linear growth factor . beyond the linear theory ,",
    "a simple relation between density and velocity divergence fields no longer hold , and we need to separately evaluate the three power spectra , @xmath25 , @xmath27 and @xmath26 , especially in the modified gravity models @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the gr , one crucial point in the modified gravity models is that a new scalar degree of freedom , sometimes referred to as the scalaron , arises and modifies the force law . in the presence of an extra scalar field , even though the conservation law of energy momentum tensor remains unchanged , the poisson equation is inevitably modified and is coupled to the field equation for scalaron . in particular , in successful modified gravity models that have a mechanism to recover gr on small scales , the scalaron generally acquires nonlinear interaction terms , and they play an important role to recover gr on small scales .",
    "thus , we need to properly take into account such a nonlinear interaction of the scalaron , and consistently solve the evolution equations of density and velocity divergence .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have developed a formalism to calculate the nonlinear power spectrum in a wide class of modified gravity models , including @xmath0 gravity and dvali - gabadadze - porratti ( dgp ) braneworld @xcite models .",
    "the formalism perturbatively treats the effect of nonlinear scalaron , and employing the standard pt technique , we have explicitly computed the power spectrum of density field , @xmath25 , at one - loop order , which reproduces the @xmath1-body results at quasi - linear scales . in what follows , we adopt this formalism to perturbatively compute auto- and cross - power spectra of density and velocity divergence .",
    "the basic equations for perturbations are briefly summarized in appendix [ sec : basiceqs_mg ] .    to compute the one - loop power spectra , specifically in the @xmath0 gravity model presented below ( sec .  [",
    "sec : rsd_frmodel ] ) , the analytic calculations starting naively with the basic equations in appendix [ sec : basiceqs_mg ] is technically difficult in practice , because the perturbation equations can not be separately treated in time and scales .",
    "instead of solving the equations for @xmath3 and @xmath35 in appendix [ sec : basiceqs_mg ] , we will numerically solve the evolution equations for the power spectra @xmath36 called the closure equation in ref .",

    "implementation and technical detail of the numerical scheme to solve the closure equations are presented in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also appendix a of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .      next consider the @xmath22 term .",
    "the expression given in eq .",

    "the non - vanishing components of @xmath44 and @xmath45 are exactly the same as those presented in ref .  @xcite ( see sec .",
    "iii - b2 ) .",
    "since the @xmath22 term appears as a next - to - leading order correction , the tree - level calculation of the bispectrum is sufficient for a consistent calculation of redshift - space power spectrum at one - loop order .",
