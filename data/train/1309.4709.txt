    "<S> the douglas  rachford splitting algorithm is a classical optimization method that has found many applications . when specialized to two normal cone operators , it yields an algorithm for finding a point in the intersection of two convex sets . </S>",
    "<S> this method for solving feasibility problems has attracted a lot of attention due to its good performance even in nonconvex settings .    in this paper , we consider the douglas  rachford algorithm for finding a point in the intersection of two subspaces . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that the method converges strongly to the projection of the starting point onto the intersection . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , if the sum of the two subspaces is closed , then the convergence is linear with the rate being the cosine of the friedrichs angle between the subspaces . </S>",
    "<S> our results improve upon existing results in three ways : first , we identify the location of the limit and thus reveal the method as a best approximation algorithm ; second , we quantify the rate of convergence , and third , we carry out our analysis in general ( possibly infinite - dimensional ) hilbert space . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide various examples as well as a comparison with the classical method of alternating projections .    * </S>",
