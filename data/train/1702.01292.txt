    "one of the most serious drawbacks associated to einstein s theory of general relativity ( gr ) is the unavoidable existence , under reasonable physical assumptions , of spacetime singularities deep inside black holes , as well as in the early universe @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that at such singularities the predictability of physical laws comes to an end because measurements are no longer possible .",
    "the underlying reason is that the existence of incomplete geodesics implies the destruction / creation of observers and/or information ( light signals ) as some limiting boundaries are approached . as a way out of this problem , penrose introduced @xcite",
    "the cosmic censorship conjecture , by which singularities emerging out of gravitational collapse are assumed to be hidden behind an event horizon , so they can not causally affect physical processes taking place in the portion of universe accessible to far away observers .",
    "since sweeping the problem under the carpet does not solve it , finding a consistent description of the interaction between gravity and matter , where the resolution of spacetime singularities may be naturally achieved , has become a major goal from different perspectives ( classical and quantum , fundamental and phenomenological ) .",
    "it is typically argued that spacetime singularities should be resolved by a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "this is supported by the idea that the quantum degrees of freedom of the gravitational field are expected to be non - negligible in regions of very high curvature .",
    "this view , inherited from the effective field theory approach to quantum theory , is very appealing but should be taken with care in gravitational scenarios , where the notion of singularity is not necessarily tied to the divergence of some quantities in some regions @xcite . for geometric theories of gravity ( classical theories ) , the very existence of observers is more fundamental than the possibility of obtaining absurd results in a measurement , as the latter is not possible without the former .",
    "it is for this reason that the existence of incomplete geodesics , for which the affine parameter is not defined over the whole real line , appears as the key element in the singularity theorems .    in the context of gr ,",
    "the incompleteness of geodesics usually occurs simultaneously with the divergence of scalar quantities , such as the energy density of the matter sources or certain curvature invariants .",
    "these divergences appear as a _ reason _ for the incompleteness of the geodesics , leading to a _ rule of thumb _ for the identification of singular spacetimes @xcite ( see @xcite for a critical viewpoint on this issue ) .",
    "indeed this has shaped many approaches to the singularity problem based on the idea that such quantities should remain bounded ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) .",
    "one of such approaches is given by classical non - linear models of the electromagnetic field .",
    "this is supported on the success of born - infeld theory of electrodynamics , where a square - root modification of the maxwell action gets rid of the divergence of the self - energy of coulomb s field by imposing a maximum bound on the electric field at the center @xcite .",
    "it is natural to wonder whether a similar mechanism for the removal of singularities could occur in the context of gravitation . in this sense",
    "born - infeld electrodynamics , though successful in making the energy density of the electromagnetic field finite , fails to keep at bay divergences on the curvature scalars when coupled to gravity , which comes alongside with the incompleteness of ( some ) geodesics @xcite . in this",
    "regard , similar attempts using other well defined non - linear electrodynamics models have failed as well @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , it is worth mentioning that some examples of non - linear electrodynamics do regularize curvature divergences @xcite , but such models are constructed in an ad hoc way and yield unphysical features , as shown by bronnikov @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this strategy has been extended to the case of gravitational actions going beyond the einstein - hilbert lagrangian of gr , such as gauss - bonnet and , more generally , lovelock theories @xcite , where similar disappointing results have been obtained ( see e.g. @xcite for some attempts in this context ) .",
    "consequently , it is fair to say that such models have been unable to find a fully consistent way out of the singularity problem in gr .    in this work",
    "we shall examine in detail the relation between energy density , curvature invariants , and geodesic completeness in some theories of gravity beyond gr .",
    "this will allow us to see if the correlations observed in gr among those quantities still persist in other gravitational theories ( see @xcite for related ideas explored in this context ) .",
    "in other words , can matter / curvature infinities be seen as the _ reason _ for the incompleteness of geodesics ?",
    "this study is relevant in order to understand what problems , if any , a quantum version of those theories of gravity should solve .    in our approach ,",
    "we interpret gravitation as a geometric phenomenon , but geometry as something more than just curvature . in the metric - affine ( or palatini ) formulation of classical gravitation , geometric properties such as non - metricity and torsion , besides curvature , are allowed by construction .",
    "the lack of these freedoms in the usual riemannian approach could be an excessive constraint with a potentially non - negligible impact on the problems that gravity theories typically exhibit at high - energy .",
    "it should be noted that non - metricity and torsion are necessary to deal with different kinds of geometric defects in continuum systems with a microstructure , such as bravais crystals or graphene @xcite .",
    "for this reason , metric - affine geometry is commonly used in the study of condensed matter physics @xcite . nonetheless ,",
    "for operational convenience , in this work we shall neglect torsion ( see , however , @xcite for a discussion on the role of torsion in metric - affine theories ) and focus on non - metricity only @xcite .",
    "indeed , the question of whether gravity as a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime is purely a matter of metrics or if the affine structure of spacetime is on equal footing as the metric one has been at debate since soon after the establishment of gr ( see e.g. @xcite for a pedagogical discussion ) .",
    "certainly , when gr is formulated  la palatini , the variation of the action with respect to the independent connection yields a set of equations that simply express the metric - connection compatibility condition .",
    "the fact that this approach yields the same dynamics as that of considering the metric as the only independent degree of freedom ( _ metric _ approach ) has frequently lead to regard the palatini variation as merely an alternative way to deriving the field equations of gr . for other theories of gravity , however , the compatibility between metric and connection is broken and the peculiarities of the metric - affine approach become manifest .    the scenario considered here corresponds to a simple quadratic @xmath0 gravity extension of gr ( for which many applications have been investigated in the literature , see e.g. @xcite ) , formulated in a metric - affine framework .",
    "it should be pointed out that with the advent of the gravitational wave astronomy following the discovery of gw150914 by ligo @xcite , both gravitational extensions of gr and exotic compact objects in such models can be put to experimental test @xcite . as the matter sector , in our setup we consider an anisotropic fluid ( constrained to satisfy standard energy conditions ) , which has been recently investigated in some detail in a number of astrophysical / cosmological scenarios @xcite .",
    "such fluids include a number of particularly interesting cases , such as that of non - linear electrodynamics .",
    "the resulting spacetimes are split into four different cases , depending on the combinations of the signs of the coupling constant of the quadratic gravity contribution and of a constant associated to the matter sector .",
    "a noteworthy feature of many of the solutions obtained is the emergence of a finite - size wormhole structure [ see @xcite for detailed account on wormhole physics ] replacing the point - like singularity typically found at the center of gr black holes .",
    "it is worth pointing out that wormholes have been suggested as solutions to spacetime singularities in approaches to quantum gravity such as loop quantum gravity @xcite and shape dynamics @xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein , where wormholes are linked to regularization mechanisms . )",
    "the main aim of the present work is to determine when the typically assumed correlation between divergence of curvature scalars and geodesic incompleteness is broken . in this sense",
    ", we note that the concept underlying the formulation of the singularity theorems @xcite is that of geodesic completeness , namely , whether a geodesic curve can be extended to arbitrarily large values of its affine parameter or not .",
    "this is a logically independent and more primitive concept than that of curvature divergences [ see @xcite for a nice discussion on this issue ] , with the latter playing no role on such theorems . as already mentioned , the widespread identification between them in the literature is explained as due to the fact that in many cases of interest ( particularly in gr ) those spacetimes having ( some ) incomplete geodesics , also yield ( some ) divergent curvature scalars @xcite . in some of the spacetimes found here",
    "we explicitly show that the presence of wormholes yield geodesically complete spacetimes , though curvature scalars may blow up at the wormhole throat .",
    "in other cases without wormholes , we meet the incompleteness of geodesics despite the finiteness of curvature scalars .",
    "the relation of these magnitudes with the ( boundedness of the ) energy density of the matter fields is also discussed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : ii ] we introduce the action and main equations of @xmath0 gravity formulated  la palatini . in sec .",
    "[ sec : iii ] we specify the matter sector of our theory under the form of an anisotropic fluid and introduce a number of constraints on it .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : iv ] , we focus our discussion upon a quadratic @xmath0 model and solve the field equations for the metric . sec .",
    "[ sec : v ] contains the main results of this work , where we study the four different classes of spacetimes , and discuss in detail the relation between energy density , curvature scalars , and geodesic completeness .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : vi ] with a summary and some perspectives .",
    "the action of @xmath0 gravity can be written as    @xmath1    with the following definitions and conventions : @xmath2 is newton s constant in suitable units ( in gr , @xmath3 ) , @xmath4 is the determinant of the spacetime metric @xmath5 , @xmath0 is a given function of the curvature scalar , @xmath6 , where the ricci tensor , @xmath7 , which follows from the riemann tensor as @xmath8 , is entirely built out of the affine connection , @xmath9 , which is a priori independent of the metric ( metric - affine or palatini approach ) .",
    "finally , @xmath10 is the matter action , which is assumed to depend only on the matter fields , collectively denoted as @xmath11 , and on the metric @xmath5 .    performing independent variations of the action ( [ eq : action ] ) with respect to metric and connection one gets two systems of equations @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the stress - energy tensor of the matter .",
    "it is worth mentioning that eq .",
    "( [ eq : connection ] ) simply states that the independent connection fails to be metric or , in other words , that a non - metricity tensor @xmath15 is present . in the gr case , @xmath16 and eq .  ( [ eq : connection ] )",
    "becomes @xmath17 , which is fully equivalent to @xmath18 and thus @xmath19 becomes the levi - civita connection of the metric @xmath5 , while the field equations ( [ eq : metric ] ) boil down to those of gr with possibly a cosmological constant term .",
    "this is the underlying reason for the equivalence between the palatini and metric formulations of gr . for more",
    "general @xmath0 lagrangians , however , non - metricity becomes an inherent feature of the field equations .",
    "it is also important to understand the intimate relation existing between matter and gravity in palatini theories of gravity .",
    "tracing with @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : metric ] ) yields the result @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the trace of the stress - energy tensor .",
    "this is not a differential equation , but instead it just establishes an algebraic , non - linear relation between curvature and matter .",
    "given an @xmath0 theory , solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : trace ] ) yields a solution @xmath23 , which generalizes the gr relation , @xmath24 .",
    "this algebraic relation explains the absence of extra dynamical degrees of freedom in our theory as compared to the usual metric approach , where the scalar curvature satisfies a second - order differential equation , thus implying the presence of propagating scalar degrees of freedom . in the palatini case ,",
    "the additional curvature terms are just nonlinear functions of @xmath22 and can be collected as extra pieces in an effective stress - energy tensor .",
    "this way , the palatini field equations for the metric ( [ eq : metric ] ) can be simply written as @xmath25 where the _ effective _ stress - energy tensor is written as @xmath26\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{f_r}\\left[\\nabla_\\mu \\nabla_\\nu f_r - g_{\\mu\\nu}\\box f_r\\right ] \\",
    ".\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] however , from a practical point of view , in many cases of interest it is easier to solve the field equations by noting that the result @xmath23 allows us to introduce in eq .",
    "( [ eq : connection ] ) a rank - two tensor @xmath27 satisfying @xmath28 such that the independent connection @xmath19 can be expressed as the christoffel symbols of the metric @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath29 \\ .\\ ] ] comparing this with eq .",
    "( [ eq : connection ] ) , it is immediately seen that the physical metric @xmath5 can be obtained out of @xmath27 according to the conformal transformations @xmath30 where , recall , @xmath31 is a function of the matter , @xmath32 .",
    "an alternative representation of the field equations is now possible in terms of @xmath27 by contracting eq .",
    "( [ eq : metric ] ) with @xmath33 and using the relations ( [ eq : conformal ] ) to obtain @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the ricci tensor constructed with the christoffel symbols of the metric @xmath27 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : lcfr ] ) .",
    "note that due to the fact that @xmath36 all the objects on the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fieldh ] ) are just functions of the matter . thus eq .",
    "( [ eq : fieldh ] ) represents a set of second - order field equations for @xmath27 and , since the conformal transformations ( [ eq : conformal ] ) depend only on the matter sources , the field equations for @xmath5 will be second - order as well . in vacuum , @xmath37 ,",
    "one has @xmath38 ( up to a trivial re - scaling of units ) and the field equations ( [ eq : fieldh ] ) reduce to those of gr with a cosmological constant term , which confirms the absence of ghost - like propagating degrees of freedom in these theories .",
    "in this work we are interested on obtaining black hole solutions in palatini @xmath0 theories , and to compare their structure with that of electrically charged black holes of gr . however , due to the fact that the non - linear corrections appearing on the right - hand - side of the new gravitational field equations ( either in eq .",
    "( [ eq : grlike ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ eq : fieldh ] ) ) depend just on the trace of the matter , @xmath39 , the new dynamics encoded in palatini @xmath0 theories can only be excited when non - traceless stress - energy tensors are considered .",
    "this implies that considering a classical maxwell electromagnetic field , whose trace is zero , would yield electrovacuum solutions identical to those of gr with a cosmological constant ( reissner - nordstrm - anti - de sitter black holes ) .",
    "thus , in order to explore new physics in these scenarios , we must consider stress - energy tensors with a non - vanishing trace .",
    "one can then assume that a trace anomaly or other types of corrections are generated by quantum effects and propose a stress - energy tensor of the following form : @xmath40 this corresponds to an anisotropic fluid , where @xmath41 is the energy density and @xmath42 are the ( different , in principle ) pressures .",
    "this class of fluids has been recently considered in refs .",
    "@xcite where , working in slightly different scenarios , it was found that wormhole solutions can be constructed in eddington - inspired born - infeld theories of gravity without violation of the energy conditions .",
    "in contrast to that approach , as we shall show below , in the palatini @xmath0 scenario considered here , wormholes can be obtained directly as solutions of the field equations without _ a priori _ designer approach .      to simplify the analysis and obtain analytically accessible scenarios ,",
    "let us constrain the functions defining our model .",
    "first we restrict the fluid to satisfy @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is a free input function whose form will be specified later .",
    "thus , the stress - energy tensor for this fluid reads @xmath46 \\ .\\ ] ] a motivation for considering these constraints is the fact that the form of the stress - energy tensor ( [ eq : sef ] ) exactly matches that of some non - linear theories of electrodynamics . indeed , in such a case , defining the matter model as a given function @xmath47 of the two field invariants @xmath48 and @xmath49 , that can be built out of the field strength tensor @xmath50 and its dual @xmath51 ,",

    ", one finds that the standard conservation equation , @xmath57 , holds in these theories .",
    "now , considering static spherically symmetric spacetimes , we can write a line element for the spacetime metric @xmath5 as @xmath58 where the functions @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are to be determined by integration of the gravitational field equations .    with this line element , the conservation equation above just reads @xmath62r_x / r=0 $ ] , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 , which can be integrated to give a relation between @xmath61 and @xmath65 as    @xmath66 \\ , \\ ] ]    where @xmath67 is an integration constant with dimensions of length and @xmath68 is the energy density without dimensions . to proceed further and integrate explicitly this equation",
    ", we need to specify a function @xmath45 .",
    "let us take the choice @xmath69 where , for dimensional consistency , @xmath70 is a dimensionless constant and @xmath71 has dimensions of inverse density .",
    "this choice covers a number of interesting cases and allows us to obtain analytical solutions . indeed , in this case , from the expression ( [ eq : kchoice ] ) , the relation between @xmath65 and @xmath61 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rrho ] ) is explicitly written as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a reference energy density that arises as an integration constant and can be fixed from the asymptotic behavior of the fluid .",
    "in particular , for @xmath74 , the fluid density and the metric far from the center tend to those generated by a maxwell field , namely , @xmath75 , which allows to relate @xmath76 with the electric charge , @xmath77 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath78 , the stress - energy tensor of the fluid exactly becomes that of a maxwell field with a vanishing trace and , as already mentioned , this yields the same dynamics as that of gr .",
    "however , non - trivial combinations of @xmath70 and @xmath71 provide modified field equations and generate new solutions .",
    "the analysis now requires to be split into the cases @xmath79 and @xmath80 , since their properties are very different . for @xmath81",
    "there is a critical radius @xmath82 } r_0 $ ] at which the energy density blows up .",
    "thus the location of the standard divergence in the density of the fluid ( maxwell case ) shifts from @xmath83 to the finite radius @xmath84 . on the other hand , for the case",
    "@xmath79 the energy density is finite everywhere , having a maximum value @xmath85 at the center .",
    "this is quite a similar result as that found in certain models of non - linear electrodynamics , such as the one of born and infeld @xcite , where the electric field attains a maximum value at the center and regularizes the energy density . in sec.[sec : v ] we will study the implications and impact of the finiteness ( or not ) of the energy density , via the bound ( [ eq : bound ] ) , on the regularity of the corresponding spacetimes .",
    "note in this sense that the particular case with @xmath78 and @xmath86 was studied in detail in ref.@xcite .    to simplify the analysis and the notation",
    "let us fix @xmath74 from now on and define @xmath87 , with @xmath88 denoting the sign of @xmath71 , and introduce the dimensionless variable @xmath89 , with @xmath84 the critical radius defined above .",
    "then , we get @xmath90 so that the energy density of the fluid simply reads @xmath91    to conclude this section , we emphasize that we are only considering matter sources satisfying the energy conditions .",
    "for instance , the weak energy condition ( wec ) states that the following conditions have to be fulfilled @xcite : @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tani ] ) . for the particular ansatz ( [ eq : sef ] ) with the choice ( [ eq : kchoice ] ) and the expressions for the energy density ( [ eq : ed1 ] ) and ( [ eq : bound ] )",
    ", it follows that the wec will be satisfied whenever @xmath95 , which is consistent with the choice @xmath74 above .",
    "to work with the simplest possible scenario , let us consider the quadratic @xmath0 model @xmath96 where @xmath97 is a constant with dimensions of length squared .",
    "this model is particularly amenable for calculations because the trace equation ( [ eq : trace ] ) yields @xmath24 , which is the same linear relation as in gr , this result being just an accident related to the functional form of the quadratic model in four dimensions . with this choice , we find that the quantity @xmath31 , which will play a key role in the characterization of the solutions , takes the simple form to take positive and negative values , then @xmath98 should be parameterized as @xmath99 .",
    "this leads to four types of models depending on the different combinations of @xmath100 and @xmath101 . ]",
    "@xmath102 where @xmath103 ( and we have introduced @xmath104 to denote the energy scale associated to the gravitational coupling constant @xmath105 ) represents the relative strength between the matter and gravitational sectors , such that the gr limit is recovered when @xmath106 .",
    "note that the parametrization of @xmath97 with @xmath107 and of @xmath71 with @xmath108 leads to four different configurations , which will be studied separately in sec.[sec : v ] .      to solve the field equations ( [ eq : fieldh ] ) we introduce a static , spherically symmetric line element for the auxiliary metric @xmath27 as @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 are two functions to be determined using the field equations ( [ eq : fieldh ] ) . from the symmetry @xmath112 one finds that @xmath113 , which implies that @xmath114 constant , which can be put to zero by a redefinition of the time coordinate without loss of generality .",
    "the remaining field equation follows from the component @xmath115 which can be simplified by introducing the mass ansatz @xmath116 leading to the first - order equation @xmath117 where @xmath118 . to handle the integration of the mass function",
    "@xmath119 it is useful to take a parametrization @xmath120 with @xmath121 representing the schwarzschild radius and @xmath122 a dimensionless constant defined as @xmath123 this puts forward that @xmath119 is made out of a constant contribution , @xmath124 , plus a term generated by the fluid and represented by the function @xmath125 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : gzfr ] ) below ) .",
    "the resulting solution allows to construct the physical metric @xmath5 by means of the conformal relations ( [ eq : conformal ] ) .",

( [ eq : mz ] ) , as a differential equation involving only the variable @xmath128 : @xmath132 with @xmath133 .",

    "this is a question of utmost interest , given the fact that geodesic completeness , namely , whether any ( null and timelike ) geodesic can be extended to arbitrarily large values of the affine parameter , is the most fundamental and generally accepted criterion to determine whether a spacetime is singular o not @xcite .",
    "since timelike geodesics are associated to physical observers and null geodesics to the propagation of information , this criterion captures the intuitive idea that in a physically well behaved spacetime _",
    "nothing can suddenly cease to exist _ and that _ nothing can emerge out of nowhere_. nonetheless , as discussed in the introduction , there is frequently a misunderstanding in the literature , taking curvature divergences as an equivalent concept to that of geodesic completeness in order to detect the presence of spacetime singularities . as we shall show in sec.[sec",
    ": v ] , such an identification explicitly breaks in many of the geometries considered in this work .",
    "thus we are mainly interested in studying the geodesic structure in those cases where the gr geodesics are incomplete and consequently yield a singularity , regardless of the presence or not of curvature divergences . to this end , in this section we shall specify the geodesic equation for palatini @xmath0 theories and solutions of the form studied here .    in a coordinate system , a geodesic curve @xmath138 associated to a given connection @xmath139",

    ", radial null geodesics reaching the @xmath191 region can clearly continue their path . given that these geodesics are insensitive to the value of @xmath122 ,",
    "one is tempted to interpret all such radial geodesics as complete , including the cases with @xmath308 .",
    "this interpretation is appealing but risky , as it would logically lead to the conclusion that the reissner - nordstrm black hole of gr is nonsingular ( as far as geodesic motion is concerned ) . to deepen into this question ,",
    "an analysis on the impact of curvature divergences on congruences of observers and on the propagation of waves would be necessary along the lines of refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "* for the case @xmath333 , it always yields wormhole structures that naturally provide geodesically complete spacetimes , much in the same way as in the @xmath288 case for @xmath178 . note that this is so despite the fact that curvature divergences are always present at @xmath171 , but the energy density is finite there .    in table [ table : i ] we display the most relevant features of the four classes of configurations classified according to the combinations of signs of @xmath97 and @xmath71 .",
    "such features are i ) the existence or not of wormhole configurations and the behaviour at the wormhole throat ( or at the center when no such wormhole exists ) of the following objects : ii ) the metric components , iii ) the energy density , iv ) the curvature scalars , and v ) the completeness ( or not ) of all null and timelike geodesics on such spacetimes . from this table",
    "it is clear the breakdown of the correlations between the behaviour of energy density , curvature scalars and completeness of geodesics in different ways .",
    "the research presented in this work is added to the growing set of results within metric - affine geometries supported by @xmath0 gravity @xcite , quadratic @xmath334 and eddington - inspired born - infeld gravities @xcite , where the point - like singularity of gr is replaced by a wormhole structure , which allows geodesics to be complete .",
    "the results obtained so far seem to point out two different mechanisms for the resolution of spacetime singularities in this context .",
    "( i ) : for @xmath0 theories the wormhole lies on the future ( or past ) boundary of the spacetime , but the fact that geodesics can be indefinitely extended means that these spacetimes are nonsingular according to the criteria employed in the singularity theorems @xcite .",
    "ii ) : for the cases of quadratic and born - infeld gravity ( which admit extensions to higher @xcite and lower @xcite dimensions with similar results ) , the wormhole may be reached in a finite affine time by some geodesics , but they are naturally extended through it .",
    "it should be stressed that in the latter case one may wonder about the physical impact of curvature divergences on physical ( extended ) bodies crossing the wormhole throat , since the presence of large tidal forces could rip them apart . in this sense , in four - dimensional born - infeld gravity a separate analysis using a congruence of geodesics to model such extended bodies has revealed that curvature divergences occurring at the wormhole throat do not pose any destructive threat , being the transit smooth and weakly affected by the large tidal forces at the throat @xcite .",
    "the problem of scalar wave scattering off this wormhole turns also to be well posed @xcite .    to conclude , the results obtained in this paper provide a fauna of examples on which the ( typically assumed ) correlations among curvature divergences , energy density , and geodesic ( in)completeness are explicitly broken .",
    "the emergence of structures such as wormholes appears as a key element for the extendibility of geodesics ( note that we also found a de sitter interior which guarantees the extendibility of geodesics in a particular example ) .",
    "these non - perturbative features should be taken into account in the interpretation of the existence of divergences in curvature scalars or in the matter fields .",
    "those infinities are significant in perturbative frameworks , where they signal the end of validity of a certain approximation , but in a non - perturbative scenario their interpretation is unclear .",
    "it is worth noting , in this sense , that in systems such as graphene , wormholes have been constructed in the discrete description through a careful design of the lattice , adding a series of heptagonal rings that help join two flat sheets with a carbon nanotube @xcite . in the continuized description ,",
    "the wormhole exhibits a curvature divergence at the throat which does not prevent the study of fermion propagation in the resulting effective geometry .",
    "this example is , in our view , very representative of what may correspond to a quantum version of the models presented here : geodesic completeness is guaranteed by non - perturbative aspects ( the wormhole ) , though infinities ( in curvature and energy density ) may arise because of the lack of control of the underlying microstructure in a certain limit @xcite .",
