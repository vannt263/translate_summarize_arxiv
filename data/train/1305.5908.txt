    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we consider a bose gas loaded in the lowest band of a 1d ol of lattice spacing @xmath0 with a superimposed lattice of spacing @xmath1 .",
    "the system is described by the hamiltonian @xmath2\\!\\ !",
    ", \\label{eq : bhh}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 denotes nearest neighbors , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the creation / annihilation operators for bosons at site @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the hopping amplitude , @xmath9 is the relative displacement between the lattices , @xmath10 is the strength of the second lattice , and @xmath11 characterizes the on - site interactions .",
    "we determine the ground - state properties , for both open and periodic boundary conditions  ( obc and pbc ) , by means of the density matrix renormalization group  ( dmrg ) method  @xcite , assuming a maximal occupation @xmath12 that we increase until reaching convergence .",
    "the effective topological nature of non - interacting fermions in 1d superlattices results from the link to electrons in a square lattice with a perpendicular magnetic field  @xcite , which are described by the hamiltonian @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the hopping along @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and the magnetic flux through a plaquette is @xmath17 . employing landau gauge ,",
    "the eigenenergies of @xmath18 are given by the 1d model above , with @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the effective topological nature may be extended to strongly - interacting 1d bosons , due to the mapping between hard - core bosons  ( hcb ) and non - interacting fermions .",
    "we borrow below concepts of 2d tis to reveal hidden topological transitions in mi phases .",
    "we note , however , that our results can not be extrapolated to interacting 2d bosons , where bose - fermi mapping is absent .",
    "we impose twisted pbc , introducing a twist angle @xmath23 by considering a tunneling @xmath24 , with @xmath25 the number of lattice sites .",
    "the topological character of the phase may be discussed using the effective 2d brillouin zone spanned by the angles @xmath9 and @xmath26 .",
    "we may determine the chern number for the many - body interacting system , following refs .",
    "@xcite , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the berry curvature  @xcite , and @xmath29 is the many - body ground - state wavefunction .",
    "moreover , we define a phase as _ bulk - gapped _ if under twisted pbc the many - body ground - state remains gapped for all @xmath30 values .",
    "we also consider below obc for the analysis of edge states . for obc",
    "the role of @xmath9 is crucial  ( note that @xmath26 is just defined under twisted pbc ) , because a bulk - gapped phase  ( in the sense discussed above ) may be gapless in the presence of obc for one or more specific values of @xmath9 . in particular , borrowing from the bulk - boundary correspondence of 2d tis , we expect that a bulk - gapped phase with an effective chern number @xmath31 should present @xmath32 values of @xmath9 at which it becomes gapless under obc . we show below that this is indeed the case , and that the gapless modes correspond indeed to edge states .",
    "we start our discussion with the case of incommensurate lattices , which , while being interesting in itself , allow us to introduce some key concepts .",
    "we consider the particular case of @xmath33 . for large - enough @xmath10 the system experiences a transition from a superfluid  ( sf ) phase to a gapless insulating phase known as bose - glass  ( bg ) .",
    "interestingly , for intermediate @xmath10 values and specific filling factors , as @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the system becomes a gapped insulator , known as incommensurate charge - density wave  ( icdw )  @xcite . as shown below , icdw phases present a non - trivial topological character .    an important insight is obtained from the analysis of the chemical potential at a given particle number @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] shows @xmath38 for @xmath39  @xcite and @xmath40 as a function of @xmath9 for @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and obc .",
    "note that the structure of @xmath38 resembles the single - particle spectrum of a ti  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we may define the particle - hole gap @xmath43 , which is particularly clear for icdw phases with @xmath44  ( @xmath45 ) and @xmath46  ( @xmath47 ) .    whereas the icdw is bulk - gapped , for obc it becomes gapless for some @xmath48 , closely resembling the appearance of edge states in the single - particle spectrum of tis .",
    "we illustrate in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] the edge - like nature of the in - gap states of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] for the case of @xmath39 with obc and @xmath49 and @xmath35 . for obc , close to @xmath50 , the ground - state and the first excited state",
    "are clearly separated from other states by the bulk gap . at @xmath48",
    "these two states swap their order .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] shows the difference between the density profile for @xmath51 , slightly smaller than @xmath50 , and @xmath52 , slightly larger than that value .",
    "note that the change in the density profile is overwhelmingly concentrated at the edges , showing that the ground - state and first excited states just differ by edge excitations .",
    "this edge - like nature of in - gap states has been observed for all topological phases discussed below .",
    "the non - trivial topology of the icdw phases is confirmed by calculating the effective chern number in the way discussed above .",
    "we obtain in particular @xmath53 for @xmath54 and @xmath55 for @xmath34  ( other icdw phases are also topological , e.g. for @xmath56 we obtain @xmath57 ) .",
    "this topological character is maintained as long as the system remains in the gapped icdw phase .",
    "[ t ]    the @xmath58 case demands a separate discussion .",
    "two different bulk - gapped phases are possible , a mi for @xmath59 and a generalized icdw  ( gicdw ) for @xmath60 up to the bg phase  @xcite .",
    "the gicdw is characterized by a density modulation at the beating quasi - period @xmath61 that is absent in the mi . under obc , whereas for the mi @xmath62 never closes being @xmath9-independent  ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) , for the gicdw it closes at two different @xmath9 values , which are exactly the one for @xmath63 and that for @xmath44 .",
    "as for other icdw phases , the closing of @xmath62 for obc is linked to edge excitations . however , the effective chern number of the gicdw phase is @xmath64 .",
    "the latter can be intuitively understood as follows . by comparing the density profile of the gicdw and the profiles for @xmath65 and @xmath35",
    ", we find that the case @xmath66 can be considered a superposition of two icdw phases with @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( note also the above mentioned @xmath9 values at which @xmath62 closes ) .",
    "recall that these two phases are characterized , respectively , by @xmath69 and @xmath53 , and hence the overall chern number vanishes . considering these sub - systems as a two - component boson system",
    ", we have the equivalent of pseudo - spin-@xmath70 bosons with counter - propagating edge states , reminiscent to the case recently discussed in the context of the iqhe for bosons  @xcite .",
    "there is hence a change of the effective topological nature of the bulk - gapped phase when growing @xmath71 at the mi - gicdw transition .",
    "we move at this point to commensurate superlattices , considering the particular example of @xmath72 . due to the trimerization of the lattice the lowest energy band splits into three sub - bands . at a filling @xmath73 and for sufficiently strong interactions",
    "a mi occurs with one particle every super - site . for hcb  ( @xmath74 )",
    ", the 1d bosons may be mapped to free fermions , and the mi may be understood as a band insulator with a full lowest sub - band . as a result",
    "the mi of hard - core bosons is a ti with chern number @xmath53  ( we call this phase mi(-1 ) ) . due to the gapped nature of the ti ,",
    "the topological character of the mi is kept as well at finite @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "the topology of the mi is maintained for any ratio @xmath71 .    a filling @xmath75 results as well in a mi with two particles every super - site .",
    "again , the hard - core case may be mapped to a band insulator with each state of the two lowest sub - bands filled once . as a result",
    "the mi phase is a ti with chern number @xmath69  ( mi(+1 ) ) . as for @xmath76",
    "the topological nature persists at finite @xmath11 , but as shown below contrary to the case of @xmath77 filling the behavior of the topological nature of the mi for a growing ratio @xmath71 is crucially different .",
    "figure  [ fig:3 ] shows as a function of @xmath71 our results for @xmath78 for phases with rational fillings @xmath77 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "we have determined for all bulk - gapped phases the effective chern number using the method described above .",
    "topological phases are bulk - gapped but present gapless edge states for specific @xmath9 values in the presence of obc .",
    "as mentioned above , the bulk - boundary correspondence  @xcite determines that a phase with chern number @xmath31 presents @xmath32 edge states , i.e. there are @xmath32 different @xmath9 values at which @xmath62 closes for obc .    for @xmath75 , as expected from the hard - core results , we find a mi(+1 ) phase for @xmath82 .",
    "however , for @xmath83 we find a different mott phase  ( mi(-2 ) ) , again with two particles per super - site , but with @xmath57 .",
    "there is hence a topological transition at @xmath84 linked to the closing of the bulk gap at @xmath85 with @xmath86 .",
    "the different nature of mi(+1 ) and mi(-2 ) is evident from the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , which shows that with obc @xmath62 closes for mi(+1 ) only at a single @xmath9 value , whereas mi(-2 ) closes at two values ( and hence has two associated edge - like excitations ) , in accordance to the bulk - boundary correspondence .",
    "we stress that although the topological character of mi(+1 ) may be well understood from the hard - core limit , the topological transition into mi(-2 ) is a direct consequence of the bosonic and interacting nature of the particles .",
    "the physics behind the different topological phases may be easily illustrated using the case @xmath87 .",
    "when @xmath10 grows the separation between sub - bands increases and each sub - band becomes narrower .",
    "the phase transition is linked to the fact that for @xmath72 and @xmath88 an insulator may occur either by filling with one particle each bloch state of the lowest two sub - bands , or by filling twice each bloch state of the lowest sub - band . whereas this observation is inconsequential for free fermions or hcb , it becomes crucial for interacting soft - core bosons . for large @xmath89 , the system minimizes the energy by placing all particles into the lowest sub - band , which is possible only due to the bosonic nature of the system . moreover , due to the very narrow bandwidth ( much smaller than @xmath11 ) of the lowest sub - band for @xmath90 , the bose gas minimizes its interaction energy by populating each available bloch state of the lowest sub - band twice . as a consequence ,",
    "the system behaves as two exact copies of the lowest sub - band , and hence the system is an insulator with a chern number twice that of the lowest sub - band , i.e. @xmath57 .    a similar reasoning may be applied for higher fillings , explaining the results of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "in particular , whereas in the hard - core regime a filling @xmath58 results in a non - topological mi  ( with all bloch states of the three sub - bands filled once ) , for large @xmath71 , the system minimizes the energy by filling three times each state of the lowest sub - band . as a result",
    "we expect a topological phase with @xmath91 at large @xmath71 , as we have confirmed in our dmrg calculations .",
    "finally , for @xmath92 , we expect @xmath53 for small @xmath71 since the energy is minimized by filling the upper sub - bands once and the lowest one twice  ( and hence @xmath53 ) . at large @xmath71 the lowest sub - band will be four - fold filled , and hence we expect @xmath93 as observed in our numerical results",
    ". moreover , a third bulk - gapped topological phase occurs with @xmath94 , corresponding to a double filling of the two lowest sub - bands .",
    "the same arguments may be applied to mott phases for bosons in superlattices with other commensurate values of @xmath46 .",
    "hence , the appearance of mott phases with different topologies as a function of the secondary lattice depth is predicted to be a general feature of bosons in 1d superlattices .",
    "although in current ol experiments only on - site interactions are relevant , inter - site interactions are expected to play a crucial role in future experiments with cold polar molecules , due to the long - range character of the electric dipole - dipole interaction  @xcite .",
    "we consider for simplicity only nearest - neighbor  ( nn ) interactions , which result in an additional term @xmath95 in eq .  .",
    "inter - site interactions may drive as well topological phase transitions in superlattice bosons , as we illustrate below for @xmath72 and @xmath88 .",
    "figure  [ fig:4 ] shows our results for the ground - state phases for @xmath78 . at small @xmath96 and @xmath71",
    "@xcite we recover , as expected from the hard - core limit , the mi(+1 ) phase . for large @xmath96 , the strong nn repulsion results in a doubly - degenerate ground state , characterized by a density modulation with a six - site periodicity  @xcite . due to this modulation",
    "we denote this phase as density - wave  ( dw ) phase .",
    "the dw phase is characterized by a chern number @xmath97 resulting from the sum of the chern numbers ( @xmath69 ) of both degenerate states . between the mi(+1 ) and dw phases we find the mi(-2 ) phase .",
    "the mi(+1)-mi(-2 ) transition is marked , as mentioned above , by a vanishing bulk gap for @xmath98 with @xmath86 .",
    "these bulk - gapless points are characterized by the non - universal exponent @xmath99 of the single - particle correlation function @xmath100 , which we have determined  ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) using conformal scaling  @xcite . for low @xmath71",
    "we observe a critical bulk - gapless line separating mi(-2)-dw  ( the bulk gap closes for @xmath101 , with @xmath86 ) characterized by @xmath102 . for large @xmath71",
    "our numerical results reveal a finite bulk - gapless region separating the mi(-2 ) and dw phases .",
    "we have shown that superlattice bosons present mott - like phases with the same fractional filling but different topological character . the hidden topological transitions at constant filling may occur both as a function of the superlattice strength and due to inter - site interactions .",
    "we note that typical ol experiments present an overall harmonic confinement  ( crucial for the existence of mott phases at the required fillings in some spatial regions ) . for free fermions or hard - core bosons",
    "the topological character of the mi phases may be evaluated from the inhomogeneous density profile , averaged over the elementary cell ( of @xmath103 sites ) , @xmath104 using streda s formula  @xcite .",
    "note , however , that mi(+1 ) and mi(-2 ) have the same @xmath105 , and hence streda s formula can not be employed for revealing the topological transition .",
    "this change may be however investigated in the presence of sharp boundaries that may be induced in ols using laser - assisted tunneling as discussed in ref .",
    "as mentioned above , whereas mi(+1 ) presents gapless edges around a single @xmath9 value , mi(-2 ) shows edges around two different @xmath9 values .",
    "moreover , the topological transition as a function of @xmath10 opens the possibility of creating a mi(+1)-mi(-2 ) boundary by employing a spatially varying strength @xmath10 .",
    "since @xmath31 jumps from @xmath80 to @xmath106 , the presence of such a boundary is accompanied by edge states at three different @xmath9 values .",
