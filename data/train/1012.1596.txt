    "the fundamental dynamical properties of stellar populations are the masses of the stars and their correlation in multiple stellar systems .",
    "the distribution of stellar masses at birth , the imf , is rather well constrained and has ( surprisingly ) been found to be invariant despite theoretical models predicting systematic variation for example of the mean stellar mass or even of the minimum mass with the physical conditions of star formation .",
    "this problematical issue has been discussed at some length by @xcite , where the imf universality hypothesis is stated .",
    "equivalently , the question may be raised whether the other distribution functions characterising a stellar population , namely the distribution functions of binary systems , are just as invariant .",
    "if this were the case then it would have important bearings on the theory of star formation as the fragmentation length - scale may then not depend much on the physical conditions of the molecular cloud core .",
    "a change in the properties of the binary - star distribution functions with mass scale , if found , would yield important clues to the fragmentation and angular momentum re - distribution processes during star formation .",
    "the three important distribution functions describing the initial binary population ( ibp ) are the distribution of periods ( @xmath1 , here always in days ) , or equivalently of semi - major axes ( @xmath2 , in au ) , the distribution of mass - ratios ( @xmath3 ) and the distribution of orbital eccentricities ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "these are related by kepler s third law : @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the orbital period in years ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 are the primary- and secondary - star masses in @xmath9 . because the periods of binary stars range over many orders of magnitude the shorthand @xmath10 is used throughout this text .",
    "observations have shown that the star - formation process is intrinsically linked to the production of binary stars .",
    "indeed , binary stars must be the dominant formation channel because the observed multiplicity fraction ( the number of multiple systems divided by the number of sources in the survey ) is indistinguishably high among old metal - poor ( @xcite ) and among thin - disk main - sequence stars ( @xcite ) , and is near unity for pre - main sequence stars and proto - stars ( @xcite ) . if , on the other hand , higher - order multiple systems were a major outcome of late - type star formation , then the dynamical decay of these on a time - scale @xmath11yr would pollute the pre - main - sequence stellar population with single stars which are not observed in large numbers .",
    "indeed , this is evidently the case for massive stars ( @xmath12 ) which appear to form preferentially in binary - rich dense cores of populous embedded clusters which rapidly decay dynamically by ejecting massive stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , according to the binary - star conjecture or theorem ( @xcite ) the vast number of stars form as binaries , while non - hierarchical higher order multiple systems can not be a significant outcome of late - type star formation .",
    "the formation of binary systems remains an essentially unsolved problem theoretically .",
    "@xcite shows analytically that isolated turbulent cloud cores can produce an unquantifiable fraction of binary systems with the very wide range of orbital periods as observed . but direct cloud collapse calculations are very limited in predicting binary - star properties owing to the severe computational difficulties of treating the magneto - hydrodynamics together with correct radiation transfer and evolving atomic and molecular opacities during collapse .",
    "the currently most advanced hydrodynamical simulations have been reported by @xcite .",
    "they allow a turbulent sph cloud to collapse forming a substantial cluster of 1253  stars and brown dwarfs amounting to @xmath13 .",
    "the cluster has a half - mass radius of about 0.05  pc and contains a very substantial binary and higher - order multiple stellar population with a large spread of semi - major axes but peaking at a few  au . after dynamical evolution with or without expulsion of the residual gas the distribution of orbits ends up being quite strongly peaked at a few  au with a significant deficit of orbits with @xmath14au , and with a deficit of systems with a mass ratio @xmath15 , when compared to the main - sequence population ( their fig .",
    "this state - of - the art computation therewith confirms the above stated issue that it remains a significant challenge for star - formation theory to account for the gaussian - type distribution of @xmath2 spanning @xmath16au as for galactic - field binaries .",
    "one essential aspect which is still missing from such computations is stellar feedback which starts heating the cloud as soon as the first proto stars appear .",
    "these heating sources are likely to counter the gravitational collapse such that in reality the extreme densities are not achieved allowing a much larger fraction of wide binaries to survive .",
    "more general theoretical considerations suggest that star - formation in dense clusters ought to have a tendency towards a _ lower _ binary proportion in warmer molecular clouds ( i.e. in cluster - forming cores ) because of the reduction of available phase - space for binary - star formation with increasing temperature ( @xcite , hereinafter ds ) . on the other hand , an _ enhanced _ binary proportion for orbital periods @xmath17 may be expected in dense clusters due to the stimulation of binary formation through tidal shear ( @xcite ) , thus possibly compensating the ds effect .",
    "the initial period distribution function ( ipf ) may thus appear similar in dense and sparse clusters , apart from deviations at long periods due to encounters and the cluster tidal field .",
    "the multiple - star population in the galactic field is build - up by star - forming events in star - clusters or groups containing from a dozen to possibly millions of stars .",
    "indeed , a certain but presently not well known fraction of stars form in small@xmath18 systems that typically have a size @xmath19au , and the dynamical decay of these is likely to affect the final distribution of @xmath20 binaries ( @xcite ) , giving rise to non - uniform jet activity ( @xcite ) .",
    "but again , quantification of their properties is next - to - impossible given the neglect of the hydrodynamical component .",
    "but , by the binary - star conjecture above , the binary formation channel must be vastly dominating over the formation of non - hierarchical higher - order multiples .",
    "it is hoped that star - forming simulations will allow essential insights into reproducing the stellar population stemming from an individual modest star - forming event . but given the computational complexity , synthesizing for example the binary population in a massive star cluster or of a whole galaxy or even parts thereof such as the solar neighbourhood are not possible . therewith it becomes rather apparent that current theory has no predictive power concerning the binary properties of stellar populations in different environments .",
    "however , by proposing that initial distribution functions of the binary - star properties ( see end of   [ sec : introd ] ) exist , that is , that there exists an outcome of the isolated ( i.e. low - density , such as in taurus - auriga ) star - formation process that can be quantified in terms of an ibp , we would be put into the situation of being able to synthesise populations .",
    "this would become feasible if it is understood how this ibp is affected by physical processes that are inherent to a binary system and that are due to stellar - dynamical encounters in denser star - forming regions .",
    "in fact , the invariance of the imf must be implying an insensitivity of the star - formation outcome to physical conditions .",
    "the imf being invariant constitutes a statistical statement on one of the birth dynamical properties of stars ( namely their distribution of masses ) .",
    "so , since both the imf and the ibp are the result of the same ( star - formation ) process , and since the imf is a result of this process `` one level deeper down '' than the ibp , it is quite natural to suggest that the formal mathematical distribution function of all of the birth dynamical properties of stars are invariant .",
    "thus the following hypothesis follows :",
    "the challenge of inferring the period- , mass - ratio- and eccentricity - distribution functions characterising the ibp can be formulated as follows : assuming the star - formation universality hypothesis to be valid and using observational constraints on the pre - main sequence binary population , the observed main - sequence galactic - field binary - star distribution function must be corrected for the dynamical processes acting in the birth - groups or birth - clusters of stars as these emerge into the galactic field .",
    "[ fig : krcid ] visualises this idea .",
    "these dynamical processes are well understood and are detailed in @xcite : energy arguments imply the heggie - hills law according to which the wide - binaries are disrupted preferentially compared to short - period binaries and tight binaries typically become tighter .",
    "the boundary between the short and long - period binaries depends on the velocity dispersion in the birth population . at the same time , binaries with a small mass ratio ( small @xmath22 ) are also preferentially disrupted .",
    "the tightening of tight binaries implies that such systems and individual stars interacting with them can be ejected from the cluster .",
    "pre - main - sequence eigenevolution evolves the short - period binaries within a time - scale of few  @xmath23yr due to system - internal dissipative processes such as tidal - circularisation , primary - star - disk  secondary - star interactions and disk  disk interactions .",
    "the dynamical disruption of binaries induced through the birth cluster and characterised by the stellar - dynamical operator @xmath24 , and the mass - ratio , eccentricity and period evolution induced through pre - main sequence eigenevolution , can both be calculated ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "@xmath25 is the stellar mass of the embedded cluster with half - mass radius @xmath26 .",
    "note that this `` embedded cluster '' does not need to be a cluster which survives the first few  @xmath27myr as a bound star cluster .",
    "it can readily be taken to include sparse star - forming aggregates of stars as observed e.g. in the about 0.5  pc radius sub - groups of a dozen pre - main sequence stars in taurus - auriga .",
    "the above two - stage transformation of the formal mathematical birth distribution functions ( @xmath28 ) to the final distribution function ( e.g. of the dispersed cluster ) can be written as @xmath29 \\right ] .",
    "\\label{eq : kromega}\\ ] ] @xmath30 is the birth distribution function taking the birth period , mass - ratio and eccentricity distribution functions to be separable , that is , the birth parameters @xmath31 are not correlated .",
    "a simple theoretical treatment of eigenevolution which is based on pre - main sequence tidal - circularisation theory has been shown to quite nicely account for the correlations between eccentricity , mass - ratio and period for short - period ( @xmath32d ) binaries .",
    "the operator @xmath33 generates the correlations between period , eccentricity and mass ratio .",
    "the stellar - dynamical operator , @xmath34 , is given by an nbody star - cluster , and can be envisioned as a transformation of the number of binaries in different binding - energy bins such that the reduction is largest in the most weakly - bound binaries .",
    "the tightening of binaries can increase the fraction of short - period binaries in a population .    putting this together ,",
    "the birth binary population is defined by the following formal mathematical rules :     to yield an estimate of the initial ( thin red curves ) period and mass - ratio distributions .",
    "note that the physical reality of @xmath35 is established if both @xmath36 and @xmath37 become consistent with the pre - main sequence data for one and the same @xmath38 .",
    "the eccentricity distribution is not affected by @xmath34.,width=384 ]    details are provided in @xcite .",
    "note that customarily the `` initial binary population '' ( ibp ) derives from the bbp after pre - main sequence eigenevolution .",
    "given that pre - main sequence eigenevolution occurs mostly for short - period binaries on a time - scale of @xmath23yr within the system , it is expected to be approximately universal .",
    "the star formation universality hypothesis thus remains valid .    passing the above",
    "easily generated _ birth _ distributions through eigenevolution and then letting the stellar - dynamical operator @xmath34 act on this resulting _ initial _ distribution leads to the galactic field population as observed .",
    "this is shown in figs  [ fig : krpqevol][fig : krqe ] for the case @xmath39pc , where the arrows indicate the action of @xmath34 .",
    "these results are valid for long - lived cluster models without gas .",

    "seungkyung oh is building on these semi - analytical results by performing direct nbody calculations of realistic young clusters and testing different pairing rules for massive stars in initially mass - segregated and unsegregated clusters .",
    "the general result is that massive stars indeed need high densities and tight binaries with mass - ratios nearby unity in order to account for their spatial distribution around star forming regions .",
    "brown dwarfs ( bds ) form an altogether distinct population from stars as is deduced by @xcite on the basis of the observed different pairing properties of brown dwarfs and very - low - mass stars on the one hand side , and stars on the other hand side .",
    "the most famous evidence for this comes from the brown - dwarf desert : while stars pair up irrespectively of their masses ( e.g. g - dwarfs typically have m - dwarf companions ) , bds are exempt from participating ( there are exceptions , but such exceptions are a natural outcome of stellar - dynamical processes ) .",
    "bds also have a very different semi - major axis distribution , by being limited to @xmath54au , while for stars @xmath2 ranges over five orders of magnitude .",
    "also , bds have a small binary fraction @xmath55 with a bias towards similar companion masses .",
    "computing the effects of the pairing properties of bds on the observed mass function , @xcite deduce that the imf must be discontinuous near @xmath56 .",
    "massive stars and bds thus can not be included in the bbp formalism above , but require their own mathematical rules . in terms of physics this means that the formation of massive stars and brown dwarfs occur in a physical regime different to that of the typical star .",
    "this is naturally understandable by noting that massive stars can only form in the densest regions of their parent embedded cluster .",
    "bds , on the other hand , typically form in the outer regions of extended circum - stellar discs of the average star , either by disc instability ( @xcite ) or by tidally - induced gravitational instability caused by passing stars in the parent cluster ( @xcite ) , or are ejected embryos ( @xcite ) .    in terms of numbers , massive stars and brown dwarfs",
    "are much rarer than the typical star : on average one bd forms per five late - type stars , while one massive star forms per few hundred late - type stars .",
    "a possibly interesting issue thus emerges : while the bd / star schism is clearly evident in the different pairing rules and the discontinuity in the imf near @xmath56 , the change of pairing rules between late - type and early - type stars ( roughly at a few  @xmath9 ) does not seem to be evident in any corresponding structure in the imf .",
    "in fact , the flattening of the imf near @xmath57 does not seem to correspond to a change in birth binary - star properties . while this fact does not contradict the above statements , it does provide an additional constraint on star - formation theories .",
    "having thus obtained a formal mathematical description of the invariant birth binary population it now becomes possible to perform dynamical population synthesis ( dypos ) .",
    "dypos rests on the same ansatz as has already been applied to model the vertical structure of the milky way disk ( @xcite ) and to model the stellar initial mass function of a whole galaxy ( @xcite ) by adding up the contributions by each embedded cluster .",
    "this lego principle comes about from the realisation that stars that ultimately end up populating the field form in groups embedded in gas ( e.g. @xcite ) .    if the birth stellar population in the groups _ and _ the transformations that occur within the groups before the population hatches into the field are understood and are known , then an entire galaxy can be synthesised .",
    "this principle is easy to implement for the integrated initial mass function ( igimf ) .",
    "it is a little bit more involved when implementing it for an integrated description of the vertical structure of the milky way disk because the stellar velocity field emerging from an embedded stellar group needs additional assumptions on its time - evolving properties .    along the same lines , the binary population in a galaxy follows from adding up all the binary populations born in the embedded groups taking into account the dynamical transformation that acts on the population in each group as it evolves and disperses , @xmath58 \\right ] \\\\ & \\times",
