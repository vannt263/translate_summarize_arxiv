    "the presence of irreversibility in nature has historically been a perplexing one .",
    "starting from the observation that all known fundamental laws of physics are reversible in time ( newton s laws , schrdinger s equation , einstein s equations , etc . ) , the questions is natural : whence irreversibility ? broadly speaking , there seems to be two schools of thought .",
    "the first school is that irreversibility is only effective .",
    "it originates from a lack of information , an inevitable coarse - graining of the physics .",
    "such an approach is embodied by loschmidt s comment to boltzmann , that given a collection of atoms that are localized in one part of container which are then released and allowed to spread throughout the container ( thus increasing the entropy ) for a time @xmath0 , if the velocity of all the atoms are then reversed , they will come back to the initial ordered state after another time @xmath0 , to which boltzmann replied , `` it is _ you _ who would invert the velocities '' @xcite .",
    "more modern approaches to irreversibility ( even in strictly classical systems ) have resolved the issue through the question of allowable observables . by restricting observables to a set of functions that are mathematically smooth , it can be rigorously demonstrated for chaotic systems that any correlation function of these observables decays both forward and backward in time @xcite .    in the quantum realm ,",
    "analogous schools of thought are present .",
    "for example , the `` loschmidt echo '' ( closely related to fidelity ) has been introduced as a figure of merit for the degree of quantum chaos of a system @xcite .",
    "the wavefunction is evolved in time under one hamiltonian , and then time - reversed with a slightly different hamiltonian . generally speaking , the longer the initial time evolution , the smaller the overlap with the original state after the time reversal , showing irreversibility to be the product of small imprecisions that are amplified by the chaotic dynamics .    for the other school of thought",
    ", irreversibility is fundamental . recalling the reversibility of the schrdinger equation , the only place to introduce fundamental irreversibility is in the phenomena of quantum measurements .",
    "it is well known that the process of measurement can not be described by unitary operations , and are irreversible .",
    "the foundations of quantum measurement theory are still controversial , despite the intervening years since quantum theory was discovered . here",
    ", we shall briefly describe two approaches to quantum measurement , and how irreversibility arises .",
    "we first discuss the text - book treatment of measurement in terms of projections of a state onto the eigenstate of an observable .",
    "the standard expression is the born rule @xmath1 , describing the probability of observing a particular result @xcite .",
    "when this result is registered , the quantum state is altered to be the eigenstate of that observed eigenvalue .",
    "this rule is an axiom of the standard copenhagen interpretation , and any kind of explanation of the origins of the rule are typically ignored .",
    "later commentary describes an interesting link between the collapse of the wavefunction and the making of a measurement record .",
    "for example , the last page of my undergraduate textbook states `` however , the making of a record is essentially an irreversible process ; the record is indelible .",
    "no process exists that will undo a measurement and delete a record , substituting another . ''",
    "another example is john wheeler s famous article , _ law without law _ , in which he states `` we are dealing with [ a quantum ] event that makes itself known by an irreversible act of amplification , by an indelible record , an act of registration . ''",
    "somehow , the leaving of tell - tale tracks in the physical space and time introduces irreversibility into the quantum world at a fundamental level .",
    "another common approach to resolving the measurement problem is the decoherence theory of quantum measurement , popularized by zurek and collaborators @xcite . in this theory , the presence of the measuring device acts as a bath , continuously dephasing the originally coherent state to a fully mixed density matrix . here , irreversibility enters because the information about the complete quantum state is jumbled up inside the quantum environment which can not be accessed . any attempt to rephase the system is doomed to fail for the same reasons that the loschmidt - echo thought experiment can not recover the overlap in a quantum chaotic system : it is not feasible to microscopically reverse the dynamics of the macroscopic dynamics , just as it is not feasible to get a gas to localize into the corner of the box by reversing all of the velocities .",
    "if one measurement by a macroscopic measuring device dephases the system a little , a second measurement will only serve to further dephase the system . therefore",
    ", saving ( an unfeasible ) microscopic time reversal of all elementary particles participating in the problem , a dephasing measurement process is irreversible .    lurking underneath",
    "this discussion is a conflict between two fundamentally different approaches to quantum measurement . in one class of approaches",
    ", the measurement process is fundamentally a mechanistic one , where wavepacket reduction is governed by physical laws .",
    "the decoherence program is one such attempt where the mechanism is ultimately reducible to random forces of the measuring device on the quantum system .",
    "the so - called `` grw '' model is another such attempt of reformulating wavefunction collapse of a single quantum measurement in terms of stochastic forces outside of standard quantum theory @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach is to view the quantum state in a bayesian framework , where the quantum state reflects our knowledge of the system . from a philosophical point of view",
    ", this analysis of continuous quantum measurements is quite similar to the copenhagen interpretation of projective measurements .",
    "in such a framework , wavefunction reduction is simply an updating of our knowledge based on new information we receive .",
    "our knowledge can be updated abruptly - as in the case of wavefunction collapse , or it can be updated gradually - as in the case of continuous measurement .    the purpose of the present paper is to advance the consequences of the bayesian approach to quantum measurement , specifically regarding the ( ir)reversibility issue .",
    "our central claim is that quantum measurements can be undone @xcite , but only in the case where there is incomplete information about the state , a so - called _ weak _ measurement @xcite .",
    "while this claim contradicts the above two more conventional approaches to quantum measurement , the seed of the idea can be seen as a loophole in the above quotations . indeed ,",
    "if there were some way to erase the informative part of the measurement record , this would nullify the information obtained in the first measurement , thereby undoing its effect on the quantum system .    the sequence of partial collapse and uncollapse is shown in fig .",
    "1 . starting with an unknown initial state @xmath2 , the first weak measurement registers a result , partially collapsing the wavefunction into another unknown state @xmath3 . to undo this operation (",
    "mathematically described as a one - to - one map ) , a second undoing measurement is applied that is formally the inverse of the first weak measurement operation .",
    "application of the inverse operation is a stochastic process , so uncollapsing the wavefunction will sometimes succeed ( in which case , the original unknown wavefunction @xmath2 is fully restored ) , and sometimes fail ( producing some other state @xmath4 ) .",
    "when the undoing procedure succeeds , the ( classical ) information obtained from the first measurement must be erased by the second measurement .",
    "we refer to this as a quantum undemolition ( qud ) measurement .",
    "notice the qud procedure has nothing necessarily to do with time - reversal .",
    "indeed , the explicit examples we give will write and erase the information with _ different _ physical processes .    before proceeding to specific systems",
    ", we note that the issue of undoing a quantum measurement has been raised previously ( see @xcite and related papers @xcite ) . in particular , we briefly discuss the relation of the theory here to the `` quantum eraser '' of scully and drhl @xcite . in this proposal ,",
    "the which - path information of a ` two - slit ' photon was stored in the quantum state of an atom .",
    "if this and similar photons were allowed to form a pattern on a detection screen , there would be no interference .",
    "however , if this which - path information were erased ( even after the photon passed through the double - slit structure ) , the interference pattern would be restored .",
    "this erasure of quantum information restored the classical interference record .",
    "our proposal is similar to this , but is in some sense its opposite : we erase _ classical _ information in the measurement record , in order to restore the original _ quantum _ state .",
    "therefore , both the nature of the information that is being erased , and the goals of the information erasure are quite different .",
    "we now give specific examples of weak continuous measurement in solid state physics to illustrate the physics of the `` quantum undemolition measurement '' .    ) at the blue line partially collapses the wavefunction .",
    "the undoing procedure turns the detector back on , and waits until the measurement record crosses the origin ( red line ) where the detector is immediately turned off , uncollapsing the wavefunction .",

    "a double - quantum - dot ( dqd ) qubit , measured continuously by a symmetric quantum point contact ( qpc ) [ fig .  1(a ) ] has been extensively studied in earlier papers @xcite .",
    "the qubit is formed from the lowest energy eigenstates in two nearby quantum dots .",
    "quantum tunnelling between the dots lifts the degeneracy , and hybridizes the states , forming the two - state hilbert space .",
    "the quantum state may be described in the individual dot basis , where @xmath5 corresponds to the right dot and @xmath6 to the left dot ( _ c.f . _",
    "the detector is the nearby quantum point contact , whose electron transmission properties are dependent on the dqd electron position via the coulomb interaction .",
    "when electrical bias is applied across the qpc ( that we take to be much larger than temperature or tunnel coupling energy ) , the measurement is characterized by the average currents @xmath7 and @xmath8 corresponding to the qubit states @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and by the shot noise spectral density @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "we treat the additive detector shot noise as a gaussian , white , stochastic process , and assume the detector is in the weakly responding regime , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 , so that the measurement process can be described by the quantum bayesian formalism @xcite .",

    "such an outcome corresponds to an equal statistical likelihood of the states @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and therefore provides no information about the state of the qubit .",
    "another way of thinking about the undoing is the following : the detector will eventually give an unambiguous answer @xmath37 or @xmath27 .",
    "one of the two measurements is giving a `` misleading '' answer : @xmath38 is going up when it should go down , or vice versa , while the other measurement is giving a `` true '' answer .",
    "if we knew which was the misleading one ( for example the first ) , we would have some information to make a valid inference about the quantum state .",

    "this problem is known as a first passage process in stochastic physics , and there are many applications of this idea @xcite .",
    "a common example is a random walker near the edge of a cliff , and we are interested in the average time it takes before disaster strikes .",

    "tomography would involve three measurements : the original measurement , the undoing measurement , and the tomography measurement , all separated by controlled unitary operations .",
    "we now briefly describe further results that extend and compliment the above analysis and discussion .    * by employing positive - operator valued measure ( povm ) formalism , we have analyzed the general case of qud measurement .",

    "there , there is also state - selective tunneling of an electron on one of the dots , to the other dot .",
    "the origin of this effect is _ spin - blockade _ - if the electrons are both spin up , the transition is energetically forbidden because the spin exchange energy puts the triplet level outside the transport window . if one electron is up and the other down , a singlet state can form , allowing the transition .",
    "irreversibility has been considered one of the hallmarks of quantum measurement .",
    "we have shown that this property does not extend to _ weak _ measurements , and described experiments to demonstrate this phenomenon in solid - state quantum systems .",

    "about it seem to be intimately related .",

    "we conclude with a quotation from a recent _ new scientist _",
    "article on this subject , `` since the birth of quantum theory we have become used to thinking of quantum measurements as creating reality : until things are measured , they do nt have an absolute , independent existence .",
