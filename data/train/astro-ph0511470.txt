    "neutrinos appear to be excellent probes for studying the deep sky .",
    "they travel large distances with the speed of light",
    ". they can pass through obstacles , without getting distorted on their way and they are not affected by the presence of magnetic fields . thus with neutrinos",
    "one can see much further than with light with light one can not observe further than 50 mpc ( 1 mpc=3.3x106 light years ) .",
    "furthermore the detection of neutrinos reveals information about the source and more specifically about the source interior . without neutrinos",
    "we would probably know nothing about the sun s interior .",
    "thus neutrinos offer a good hope for understanding the early stages of a supernova . in a typical supernova an energy of about @xmath1 ergs",
    "is released in the form of neutrinos @xcite,@xcite .",
    "these neutrinos are emitted within an interval of about @xmath0 s after the explosion and they travel to earth undistorted , except that , on their way to earth , they may oscillate into other flavors .",
    "the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations is by now established by the observation of atmospheric neutrino oscillations @xcite interpreted as @xmath2 oscillations , as well as @xmath3 disappearance in solar neutrinos @xcite .",
    "these results have been recently confirmed by the kamland experiment @xcite , which exhibits evidence for reactor antineutrino disappearance .",
    "thus for traditional detectors relying on the charged current interactions the precise event rate may depend critically on the specific properties of the neutrinos .",
    "the time integrated spectra in the case of charged current detectors , like the sno experiment , depend on the neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "this , of course , may turn into an advantage for the study of the neutrino properties @xcite .",
    "an additional problem is the fact that the charged current cross sections depend on the details of the structure of the nuclei involved .    during the last years various detectors aiming at detecting recoiling nuclei",
    "have been developed in connection with dark matter searches @xcite with thresholds in the @xmath0 kev region .",
    "recently , however , it has become feasible to detect neutrinos by measuring the recoiling nucleus and employing gaseous detectors with much lower threshold energies .",
    "thus one is able to explore the advantages offered by the neutral current interaction , exploring ideas put forward more than a decade ago @xcite . this way the deduced neutrino fluxes do not depend on the neutrino oscillation parameters ( e.g. the mixing angles ) . even in our case , however , the obtained rates depend on the assumed characteristic temperature for each flavor , see sec . [ sec.supernova ] . furthermore this interaction , through its vector component , can lead to coherence , i.e. an additive contribution of all nucleons in the nucleus .",
    "since the vector contribution of the protons is tiny , the coherence is mainly due to the neutrons of the nucleus .    in this paper",
    "we will derive the amplitude for the differential neutrino nucleus coherent cross section .",
    "then we will utilize the available information regarding the energy spectrum of supernova neutrinos and estimate the expected number of events for all the noble gas targets .",
    "we will show that these results can be exploited by a network of small and relatively cheap spherical tpc detectors placed in various parts of the world ( for a description of the apparatus see our earlier work @xcite ) .",
    "the operation of such devices as a network will minimize the background problems .",
    "there is no need to go underground , but one may have to go sufficiently deep underwater to balance the high pressure of the gas target .",
    "other types of detectors have also been proposed @xcite,@xcite . +",
    "large gaseous volumes are easily obtained by employing long drift technology ( i.e tpc ) that can provide massive targets by increasing the gas pressure . combined with an adequate amplifying structure and low energy thresholds , a three - dimensional reconstruction of the recoiling particle , electron or nucleus , can be obtained .",
    "the use of new micropattern detectors and especially the novel micromegas @xcite provide excellent spatial and time accuracy that is a precious tool for pattern recognition and background rejection @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the virtue of using such large gaseous volumes and the new high precision microstrip gaseous detectors has been recently discussed in a dedicated workshop @xcite and their relevance for low energy neutrino physics and dark matter detection has been widely recognized .",
    "such low - background low - energy threshold systems are actually successfully used in the cast @xcite , the solar axion experiment , and are under development for several low energy neutrino or dark matter projects @xcite,@xcite .",
    "before we embark on our calculations involving the event rates for supernova neutrino detection of a gaseous tpc detector we like to spend a little time in discussing the detector . a description of the nostos project and details of the spherical tpc detector are given in @xcite and is shown in [ fig : tpc_draw ] .",
    "we have built a spherical prototype 1.3 m in diameter which is described in @xcite ( see fig . [",
    "fig : prototype ] ) .    , @xmath4 , spherical vessel of cu @xmath5 thick , pressure up to @xmath6 bar ( already tested up to @xmath7 bar ) , vacuum tight , @xmath8 mbar ( outgassing @xmath9 mbar / s ) ]    .",
    "[ fig : prototype ]    the outer vessel is made of pure cu ( 6 mm thick ) allowing to sustain pressures up to 5 bar .",
    "the inner detector is just a small sphere , 10 mm in diameter , made of stainless steel as a proportional counter located at the center of curvature of the tpc .",
    "we intend to use as amplifying structure a spherical tpc @xcite and developments are currently under way to build a spherical tpc detector using new technologies .",
    "first tests were performed by filling the volume with argon mixtures and are quite promising .",
    "high gains are easily obtained and the signal to noise is large enough for sub - kev threshold .",
    "the whole system looks stable and robust .",
    "the advantages of using the spherical detector concept are the following ;    1 .",
    "the natural radial focusing of the tpc allows to collect and amplify the deposited charges by a simple and robust detector using a single electronic channel to read out a large gaseous volume . the small size associated to small detector capacitance permits one to achieve very low electronic noise . in the present prototype",
    "the noise is as low as a few hundred electrons and has easily been obtained ; with optimized low noise amplifiers we hope to lower it to the level of a few tenths .",
    "this is a key point for the obtaining a very low energy threshold , i.e. down to 100 ev , by operating the detector at moderate gain of about 100 .",
    "such low gains are easily obtained at atmospheric pressure and open the way to operate the tpc at high pressures .",
    "we target to achieve pressures as high as 10 bar for xenon gas .",
    "even higher pressures by a factor 3 - 6 are aimed at in the case of argon gas in order to achieve , to first order , the same number of events . 2 .",
    "the radial electric field , inversely proportional to the square of the radius , is a crucial point for measuring the depth of the interaction by a simple analysis of the time structure of the detector signal .",
    "a position resolution of about 10 cm has been already obtained , a fact that is of paramount importance for improving the time resolution of the detector and rejecting background events by applying fiducial cuts .",
    "3 .   building a high pressure metallic sphere , for instance made out of stainless steel or copper , seems to assure an excellent quality of the gas mixture and turns out that a single gas filling with pure gas is sufficient to maintain the stability of the signal for several months .",
    "we are pushing the technology to improve the properties of the various elements in order to achieve stability over many years .",
    "big high pressure - secure tanks are under development by many international companies for hydrogen or oil storage , and therefore the main element of the tpc could be shipped at moderate cost .",
    "our idea is then to build several such low cost and robust detectors and install them in several places over the world .",
    "first estimations show that the required background level is modest and therefore there is no need for a deep underground laboratory .",
    "a mere 100 meter water equivalent coverage seems to be sufficient to reduce the cosmic muon flux at the required level ( in the case of many such detectors in coincidence , a modest shield is sufficient ) .",
    "the maintenance of such system could be easily assured by universities or even by secondary schools .",
    "thanks to the simplicity of the system it could be operated by young students with a specific running program and simple maintenance every a few years . notice that such detector scheme , measuring low energy nuclear recoils from neutrino nucleus elastic scattering , do not determine the incident neutrino vector and , therefore , it is not possible this way to localize the supernova .",
    "a cluster of such detectors in coincidence , however , could localize the star by a triangulation technique . + a network of such detectors in coincidence with a sub - kev threshold",
    "could also be used o observe unexpected low energy events .",
    "this low energy range has never been explored using massive detectors",
    ". a challenge of great importance will be the synchronization of such a detector cluster with the astronomical @xmath10-ray burst telescopes to establish whether low energy recoils are emitted in coincidence with the mysterious @xmath10 bursts .",
