    "is lost , we do no longer deal with probability distributions : in fact , discarding states at the boundary implies a time decay of the integrated density of states [ which , for commodity , we still refer to as @xmath110 ] . ignoring the nonlinearities , the problem now takes the form of solving the fokker - planck equation ( [ f_p_r ] ) for an initial condition @xmath148 , and with the requirement that @xmath110 has to vanish at the boundary .",

    "although the linearization scheme on which these mappings rely is inaccurate in the vicinity of the boundary , it is possible to incorporate nonlinear effects in a simple and pragmatic manner , as shown below .",
    "however , first let us consider the linearized problem , being a first - passage to a sphere of radius @xmath150 , which is , e.g. , treated in chapter 6 of ref . @xcite . the solution is known to be a combination of modified bessel functions of the first and second kind . actually",

    "this approach allowed us to quantitatively study the effect of finite - size fluctuations in a system with a large , yet _ finite _ , number @xmath3 of agents .",
    "while the classical rate equations of the cyclic lotka - volterra model predict the existence of one ( neutrally stable ) center fixed point , associated with the _ coexistence _ of all the species , this picture is _ dramatically _ invalidated by the fluctuations which unavoidably appear in a finite system .",
    "the latter were taken into account by a fokker - planck equation derived from the underlying master equation through a van kampen expansion .    within this scheme",

    "in this context , we have investigated the probability for such extinction to occur at a given time @xmath15 . as a main result of this work",
    ", we have shown that this extinction probability is a function of the scaling variable @xmath183 . exploiting polar symmetries displayed by the deterministic trajectories in the phase portrait and using a mapping onto a classical first - passage problem",

    ", the probability of extinction grows , asymptotically reaching @xmath191 for @xmath192 , so that , for finite @xmath3 , fluctuations are _ always _ responsible for extinction and thus dramatically jeopardize the possibility of coexistence and biodiversity .",
    "interestingly , these findings are in qualitative agreement with those ( both experimental and numerical ) reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was found that in a well mixed environment ( as in the urn model considered here ) two species get extinct .    while this work has specifically focused on the stochastic cyclic lotka - volterra model , the addressed issues are generic .",
    "indeed , we think that our results and technical approach , here illustrated by considering the case of a paradigmatic model , might actually shed further light on the role of fluctuations and the validity of the rate equations in a whole class of stochastic systems .",
    "in fact , while one might believe that fluctuations in an urn model should always vanish in the thermodynamic limit , we have shown that this issue should be dealt with due care : this is true for systems where the rate equations predict the existence of an asymptotically stable fixed point , which is always reached by the stochastic dynamics @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in systems where the deterministic ( rate equation ) description predicts the existence of ( neutrally stable ) center fixed points , such as the cyclic lotka - volterra model , fluctuations have dramatic consequences and hinder biodiversity by being responsible ( at long , yet finite , time ) for extinction of species @xcite . in this case , instead of a deterministic oscillatory behavior around the linearly ( neutrally ) stable fixed point , the stochastic dynamics always drives the system toward one of its absorbing states .",
