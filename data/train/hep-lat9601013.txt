    "having started from qcd , one is then in position to repeat the numerical studies that have been done in the case of compact qed .",

    "this is an important result because it is the photons @xmath37 that contain the monopoles that are supposedly responsible for confinement .",
    "further support to the dual superconductor picture is provided by measuring the string tension generated from monopoles alone and showing that it reproduces the full su(2 ) string tension  @xcite .",
    "abelian dominance may be interpreted as evidence that in maximal abelian ( ma ) projection the off - diagonal gluons @xmath51 can be neglected altogether , so that the wilson loop is constructed simply from diagonal `` photons '' .",
    "however , this `` diagonal approximation ''  @xcite is easily seen to be oversimplified by considering color sources ( quarks ) in su(2 ) representations @xmath53 other than the fundamental ( @xmath54 ) . for @xmath55 ( adjoint representation ) the diagonal approximation forces the string tension to be zero not only in ma , but in _ any _ abelian projection , since the @xmath56 component of the adjoint source can not couple to diagonal gluons and remains unconfined  @xcite .",
    "this result is in disagreement with the fact that the adjoint potential shows for intermediate separations a casimir scaling linear behavior  @xcite and has been interpreted as evidence for the failure of the abelian projection mechanism  @xcite . simulating qcd with adjoint color sources can therefore provide valuable insight into the dynamics of abelian projection .    in this work",
    "the maximal abelian projection is reviewed .",
    "it is shown that the dynamics of the theory in ma projection can be understood in terms of the following properties : ( a ) @xmath57 is fixed to a value close to ( but not exactly equal to ) one ( b ) @xmath58 dependence factorizes ( c ) the effective action may be reasonably approximated as involving only @xmath37 fields . at @xmath59 , where the calculations reported here are performed , @xmath60 of the su(2 )",

    "thus , to a first approximation the phases @xmath65 can be treated as random , and the phases @xmath58 as frozen . by integrating over @xmath65 and using @xmath58-factorization",
    "it is shown that abelian dominance for sources in the fundamental representation readily follows from this approximation .",
    "for adjoint sources the wilson loop can be split  @xcite into contributions from the electrically ( i.e. , with respect to the residual u(1 ) symmetry ) neutral ( @xmath66 ) and electrically charged ( @xmath67 ) components of the adjoint source .",
    "is is shown that the `` diagonal '' approximation is not reproducing the ma projection results as can be most clearly seen by comparing their respective predictions for the electrically neutral adjoint wilson loop @xmath68 : the diagonal approximation predicts it should be @xmath69 , while ignoring the @xmath65-dependent terms in the action predicts it should fluctuate around 0 , albeit with a perimeter law falloff .",
    "this latter result simply means that to account for the confining behavior of the @xmath66 components of the adjoint source , fluctuations of the diagonal gluon field have to be taken into account as well . on the other hand , the above approximation ( i.e. ignoring the small , @xmath65-dependent terms in the action ) implies that the string tension from the electrically charged part of the adjoint wilson loop @xmath70 must be given by doubly charged abelian wilson loops @xmath71 .",
    "it is numerically found that @xmath70 generates roughly the same string tension as the full adjoint wilson loop @xmath72 = @xmath73 , in accord with calculations in three dimensions  @xcite .",
    "this last result may then be used as phenomenological input , which , combined with the above analysis , suggests that doubly charged abelian wilson loops should reproduce the full su(2 ) string tension in ma projection . numerical evidence in support of this result",
    "is presented .",
    "thus , abelian dominance can be extended to quarks transforming in the adjoint representation .",
    "doubly charged loops in cqed generate a string tension that casimir - scales , and is therefore equal to @xmath74 times the one from singly charged loops  @xcite .",
    "abelian dominance for adjoint sources on the other hand means that this ratio is in ma projection equal to the ratio of quadratic casimirs @xmath75 between adjoint ( @xmath55 ) and fundamental @xmath76 ) su(2 ) representations , that is , @xmath77 @xmath78 2.7 ( in f12 projection is found to be less than 2 ) .",
    "these results show that abelian qcd is certainly closer to cqed in ma projection than it is in local projections like f12 but still quite different , as is necessary due to the qualitative differences such as deconfinement phase transition , asymptotic freedom etc .",
    ", between qcd ( which abelian qcd in ma projection presumably reproduces ) and cqed . in the context of the ma projection properties we mentioned above these non - wilson type of @xmath37-dependent action terms originate in the expansion of the fadeev - popov determinant",
    "finally , the mechanism of charge screening ( breaking of the adjoint flux tube at large quark - antiquark separations ) is discussed in the framework of ma projection abelian qcd .",

    "[ ch ] and eq .",
    "( [ pol2 ] ) suggests that the full adjoint su(2 ) string tension is given by the doubly charged abelian wilson loop , @xmath199 . in other words ,",
    "the observed adjoint string tension arises from the interaction of diagonal gluons ( photons ) with the part of the adjoint source that is charged ( doubly ) with respect to the cartan subgroup .",
    "if this is indeed verified by simulation it should be regarded as adjoint abelian dominance .",

    "( [ e16 ] ) , are proportional up to a constant @xmath69 .",
    "thus , they can not simultaneously lead to an area law .",
    "this difference reflects the fact that fundamental abelian dominance is oblivious to the difference between ma projection and the diagonal approximation , whereas adjoint abelian dominance is not .",
    "if verified by simulations , adjoint abelian dominance is a non - trivial result for the following reason : it is well known that in compact electrodynamics wilson loops constructed from u(1 ) links in representation @xmath117 ( i.e. , @xmath117-ply charged ) lead to string tension scaling with the u(1 ) casimir @xmath142  @xcite .",

    "direct _ numerical evidence for adjoint abelian dominance is shown in fig .",
    "[ dad ] where creutz ratios from full su(2 ) wilson loops are compared to creutz ratios from doubly charged abelian loops . as we have remarked earlier on",
    ", the lack of variance reduction and smearing techniques makes the calculation of doubly charged abelian wilson loops very difficult .",

    "these results seem to support adjoint abelian dominance but certainly more calculations ( demanding resources unavailable to us ) are needed before definitive conclusions may be drawn .",

    "[ fad ] : they are more difficult to measure but consistently higher than the unprojected su(2 ) ones .    the last topic that should be discussed is the physics of charge screening in abelian projected qcd with adjoint sources . in the diagonal approximation picture screening comes about automatically since @xmath211 does not support a string tension , as we have already discussed .",
    "however , with respect to the conjecture that abelian dominance can be understood in the context of doubly charged abelian wilson loops , there appears to be an important caveat : once the doubly charged abelain wilson loops develop a string tension there seems to be no way that this abelian flux - tube can break , since the photons are neutral themselves and can not couple with the charged sources to form electrically neutral states ( the analog of `` gluelumps '' ) . of course one may argue that the off - diagonal gluons @xmath51 which carry double charge can now form electrically neutral states with the charge - two sources thus screening the abelian potential obtained from doubly charged wilson loops .",
    "it is more subtle though to address this question in the context of an effective abelian theory that results from the integration of the charged gluons ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "this theory ( c.f .",
    "( [ pol2 ] ) ) contains just photons ( and monopoles ) .",
    "what happens is probably the following  @xcite : the loop expansion of the fadeev - popov determinant leads to terms in the effective @xmath37 action that contain doubly charged plaquettes of size @xmath212 where @xmath172 corresponds to the critical distance where gluelumps screen the adjoint sources in full su(2 ) . due to the numerical difficulties",
    "the presence of these terms in the action has not been established in ref .",
    "@xcite but they are presumably there . when the wilson loop is large enough to `` accommodate '' such terms one can use them ( only a small number is necessary ! ) to `` patch '' the area of the wilson loop  @xcite . as a result",
    "the wilson loop does not fall like the area any more ( as would be the case with only @xmath116 plaquettes in the action ) and a crossover to perimeter law falloff occurs .",
    "in abelian projected qcd monopoles , contained in the diagonal gluon ( photon ) fields @xmath37 are supposed to be responsible for confinement , by squeezing the abelian flux between electrically charged sources inside abrikosov flux - tubes .",
    "thus , a demonstration that abelian wilson loops reproduce the full qcd string tension is crucial evidence in favor of this mechanism .",
    "the maximal abelian projection is the only projection in which this property of `` abelian dominance '' has been observed , and for quarks transforming in the fundamental representation . in this work a framework for describing the dynamics of abelian projected qcd in the maximal abelian projection is discussed .",

    "gluons are mostly diagonal : at @xmath59 @xmath213 .",

    "the perimeter term in this case is @xmath186 . * adjoint wilson loops constructed from rescaled su(2 ) links",
    "should not be used for testing adjoint abelian dominance because they fluctuate around @xmath69 , in _ any _ abelian projection , and therefore lead to a vanishing abelian potential .",
    "* the neutral ( i.e. , @xmath66 ) adjoint wilson loop fluctuates around 0 , not around @xmath69 as ignoring the off - diagonal gluons would predict , albeit with a perimeter law falloff . however , @xmath65-integration can not be carried out consistently unless the @xmath65-dependent part of the action is also included .",
    "thus , the abelian operator that generates the string tension of the neutral adjoint wilson loop can not be predicted in a simple way .",
    "numerically it is then found that charged wilson loops have approximately the same , casimir scaling , string tension as the gauge invariant full adjoint wilson loop . using",
