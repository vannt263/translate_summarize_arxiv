    "dynamics of domain walls in nanowires underlies modern memory@xcite and logic@xcite devices , see also review ref .  .",
    "most of these designs require wires with curvilinear segments , e.g. vertical configuration of the racetrack magnetic memory.@xcite therefore , the modification of dynamic and static properties of a domain wall due to the wire curvature is of high importance for the applications .",
    "it is known that the local curvilinear defects of the wire can be a source of pinning potential for the domain wall.@xcite however , in contrast to widely studied mechanisms of the domain wall pinning , such as interaction with artificial notches,@xcite surface roughnesses,@xcite inhomogeneities in the magnetocrystalline anisotropy distribution,@xcite the role of the curvature remains unclear and the general theory is absent .",
    "nevertheless , one should note some progress in studying the simplest case of circular wire geometry , where the domain wall pinning is achieved due to the applied external magnetic field.@xcite    as it was recently shown @xcite the exchange interaction in a curvilinear wire can produce an effective dzyaloshinsky - like term . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that the inhomogeneous distribution of this curvature induced dzyaloshinsky - like contribution can be an origin of domain wall pinning at the local wire bend , analogously to the case of studied anisotropy inhomogeneities.@xcite considering the coordinate dependent curvature of the wire we propose a general approach valid for a wide class of geometries .",
    "in this paper we consider a plane curved ferromagnetic wire of circular cross - section .",
    "such a wire can be parameterized in the following way : @xmath0 here the three - dimensional radius vector @xmath1 defines the space domain , occupied by the wire , the two - dimensional vector @xmath2 determines the wire central line , which lies within the @xmath3-plane , with @xmath4 being the natural parameter ( arc length ) . within a wire cross - section",
    "the polar coordinates @xmath5 $ ] and @xmath6 are used , where @xmath7 is the wire radius .",
    "we use here the frenet - serret basis ( @xmath8 ) with @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 being the tangential , normal , and binormal unit vectors , respectively . here",
    "the wire curvature @xmath12 is introduced .    using the frenet - serret basis",
    "one can introduce the angular magnetization parameterization @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the normalized magnetization unit vector with @xmath15 being the saturation magnetization .",
    "magnetization dynamics of this system can be studied by means of phenomenological landau - lifshitz equations @xmath16 where overdot indicates the time derivative , frequency @xmath17 determines the characteristic time scale of the system with @xmath18 being the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath19 is normalized total energy , and @xmath20 is the damping coefficient .",
    "we start with a simple model , which takes into account only two contributions to the total magnetic energy @xmath21\\text{d}s,\\ ] ] namely , exchange one @xmath22 and easy - tangential anisotropy  the second term in ( [ eq : total - energy ] ) . here",
    "@xmath23 is area of the wire cross - section , @xmath24 is the exchange length with @xmath25 being exchange constant , and @xmath26 is the dimensionless anisotropy constant . here",
    "@xmath27 is constant magnetocrystalline anisotropy of easy - tangential type and the term @xmath28 comes from the magnetostatic contribution .",
    "it is known@xcite that for thin wires of circular and square cross - sections the magnetostatic energy is reduced to an effective easy - tangential shape anisotropy with @xmath29 , including case of a curvilinear wire.@xcite competition of the exchange and anisotropy contributions results in the length scale of the system @xmath30 . for magnetically soft wires @xmath31 and @xmath32 . in ( [ eq : total - energy ] ) and everywhere below we restrict ourselves with the case of thin wire @xmath33 , thus we assume that the magnetization varies along the wire and it is uniform within a wire cross - section : @xmath34 .    in terms of the angular parametrization ( [ eq : parameterization ] ) the exchange energy density has a form@xcite @xmath35 where the prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath4 . in ( [ eq : eex - density ] ) it is taken into account that a plane wire has zero torsion .",
    "let us first analyze static solutions of ( [ eq : lle ] ) . in this case",
    "there is a solution @xmath36 , which corresponds to a planar magnetization distribution : vectors @xmath37 lie within the wire plane .",
    "the corresponding function @xmath38 is determined by an inhomogeneous sine - gordon equation ( for details see appendix  [ app : stat - sol ] ) @xmath39     nm , total length @xmath40  @xmath41 m and @xmath42 nm@xmath43 ( only the bend vicinity is shown ) .",
    "the bottom row demonstrates comparison of magnetization components @xmath44 and @xmath45 obtained from the simulations ( markers ) and from the ansatz  ( [ eq : ansatz - stat ] ) ( lines ) . in the latter case",
    "the domain wall width @xmath46 was used . ]    for the case @xmath47 ( rectilinear or circular wire ) eq .  ( [ eq : sg ] ) has the well known domain wall solutions @xmath48 $ ] of head - to - head ( @xmath49 ) or tail - to - tail ( @xmath50 ) types . here",
    "@xmath51 determines the domain wall position and @xmath52 is the wall width . for the case",
    "@xmath53 an additional driving force appears and the curvature induced domain wall dynamics is expected . in the following ,",
    "we consider a case of a localized curvature , i.e. @xmath54 and @xmath55 , see figs .",
    "[ fig : stat - dw ] ,  [ fig : geometry](a ) , this results in the boundary conditions @xmath56 , the same as for a rectilinear wire .",
    "we also restrict ourselves with the case @xmath57 assuming that the domain wall remains its form and the curvature influence results in a weak modification of the width @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , to analyze the domain wall properties ( static as well as dynamic ones ) we use collective variable approach@xcite based on the simple @xmath59 model@xcite    @xmath60 , \\quad \\phi=\\phi(t),\\ ] ]    which is widely used for different types of domain walls and various drivings.@xcite the domain wall position @xmath51 and phase @xmath61 , which determines orientation of the transversal magnetization component , make a canonically conjugated pair of collective variables . the domain wall width @xmath58 is shown to be a slaved variable,@xcite i.e. @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "however , this is not the case when @xmath61 depends on coordinate@xcite ( it is possible for a three dimensional wire , when the torsion is present ) , in this case a generalization of the @xmath59 model@xcite must be applied .",
    "substituting now the ansatz ( [ eq : ansatz - stat ] ) into ( [ eq : total - energy ] ) one obtains the total energy in the form ( up to an additive constant ) @xmath63 where the condition @xmath64 was applied when integrating ( [ eq : total - energy ] ) , for details see appendix  [ app : q - phi - det ] . the first term in ( [ eq : e - narrow - dw ] ) reflects the exchange - anisotropy competition which determines the domain wall width for a rectilinear wire . the second and",
    "the third terms originate from dzyaloshinsky - like and anisotropy - like terms , respectively , which effectively appear in the exchange energy due to the curvature.@xcite minimization of ( [ eq : e - narrow - dw ] ) with respect to parameters @xmath51 and @xmath61 results in the following equilibrium values @xmath65 and @xmath66 : @xmath67 thus , the domain wall is pinned at the maximum of the curvature , and the phase selectivity takes place : the head - to - head domain wall is always directed outward while the tail - to - tail one is directed inward the bend , see fig .",
    "[ fig : stat - dw ] .",
    "the latter effect was recently observed experimentally.@xcite there is an intuitive explanation : the choice of @xmath66 defined by ( [ eq : equilibr - params ] ) makes the magnetization distribution more homogeneous , see fig .",
    "[ fig : stat - dw ] , which decreases the exchange energy .",
    "as it follows from ( [ eq : e - narrow - dw ] ) , the equilibrium value of the domain wall width @xmath68 is the same as for a rectilinear wire .",
    "however , if the wall is perturbed and the values of quantities ( @xmath69 ) deviate from the equilibrium ( [ eq : equilibr - params ] ) , the domain wall width is modified as follows @xmath70^{-1/2}$ ] , where @xmath71 is coefficient of the curvature induced effective easy - binormal anisotropy . the similar domain wall width modification caused by a geometrical constrain",
    "was discussed in ref .  .",
    "as it follows from the fig .",
    "[ fig : stat - dw ] the used ansatz ( [ eq : ansatz - stat ] ) and the obtained static results ( [ eq : equilibr - params ] ) are in a good agreement with the simulations results .",

    "@xmath75 the equations of motion ( [ eq : dynamic - equations ] ) linearized with respect to the deviations read @xmath76 for the case of small @xmath20 the solution of ( [ eq : linearized ] ) results in harmonic decaying oscillations @xmath77 , @xmath78 with frequency @xmath79 and modified effective friction @xmath80 the phase @xmath81 is determined by the initial conditions . in ( [ eq : oscil - freq ] ) and ( [ eq : friction ] ) it is taken into account that @xmath82 and @xmath83 at the maximum point @xmath65 .    it should be noted that an energy expression analogous to ( [ eq : e - narrow - dw ] ) was earlier obtained for a certain case of a circular wire segment.@xcite however , the circular geometry does not produce any geometrical pinning potential due to the constant curvature @xmath84 , which results in @xmath85 and undefined @xmath65 .",
    "nevertheless , the domain wall can have an equilibrium position in circular segment in the presence of an external magnetic field.@xcite    in more general case @xmath86 the ansatz ( [ eq : ansatz - stat ] ) leads to the following expressions for the eigen - frequency and effective friction @xmath87 in this case the equilibrium position @xmath65 is defined by the equation @xmath88 and the equilibrium value of @xmath66 coincides with one defined in ( [ eq : equilibr - params ] ) , for details see appendix  [ app : q - phi - det ] .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the pinning potential and the corresponding domain wall oscillations have purely exchange origin , while the weak interactions , e.g. magnetostatic one , contribute mediately via value of parameter @xmath89 .",
