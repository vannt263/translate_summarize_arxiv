    "hill s vortex is a particular ( limiting ) case of the norbury - fraenkel family of 3d axisymmetric vortex rings @xcite .",
    "given the stokes streamfunction @xmath4 and the operator @xmath5 , where @xmath6^t$ ] ( `` : = '' means `` equal to by definition '' ) , these flows satisfy the following system in the frame of reference moving with the translation velocity @xmath7 of the vortex    [ eq : euler3d ] @xmath8    where the vorticity function @xmath9 has the form @xmath10 in which @xmath11 and @xmath12 are constants . system  therefore describes a compact region @xmath13 with azimuthal vorticity @xmath14 varying proportionally to the distance @xmath15 from the flow axis embedded in a potential flow .",
    "the boundary of this region @xmath16 is a priori unknown and must be found as a part of the problem solution . system  thus represents a _ free - boundary _ problem and , as will become evident below , this property makes the study of the stability of solutions more complicated . for hill s vortex the equilibrium shape of the boundary @xmath17 has the form of a sphere with the flow described in the translating frame of reference by the streamfunction @xmath18 , & \\mbox{if } &   x^2+\\sigma^2 > a^2 ,   \\end{array } \\right .",

    "the components of the velocity field @xmath20^t$ ] can then be obtained as @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "constant @xmath24 in , the translation velocity @xmath7 and the vortex radius @xmath19 are all linked through the relation @xcite @xmath25 from which it follows that , for a fixed radius @xmath19 , hill s vortices represent a one - parameter family of solutions . to fix attention , unless indicated otherwise , hereafter we will set @xmath26 , @xmath27 , so that @xmath28 ( i.e. , the vortex is moving to the left ) .    due to the presence of a sharp interface separating the vortical and potential flow regions , inviscid vortices in two and three dimensions",
    "are described by equations of the free - boundary type .",
    "in addition to making the process of finding ( relative ) equilibrium configurations more difficult , this also complicates their stability analysis .",
    "the main difficulty is that generic perturbations modify the domain on which the governing partial differential equations ( pdes ) are defined together with their boundary conditions , an effect which must be taken into account in the derivation of the linearized evolution equations .",
    "most earlier approaches to studying stability of inviscid vortices have relied on methods adapted to specific problems .",
    "the stability of the simplest configurations , namely the rankine and kirchhoff vortices , was first investigated , respectively , by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "further insights about these problems were provided by the studies of @xcite .",
    "the linear stability of more complex vortex configurations , such as polygonal arrays of corotating vortices and translating vortex pairs , was investigated by @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "a noteworthy feature of their approach is that they also used a _ continuous _ perturbation equation independent of a particular discretization employed to obtain the equilibrium solution .",
    "the linear stability of the so - called v - states @xcite , corotating vortex patches and infinite periodic arrays of vortices was investigated in detail by @xcite , see as well @xcite .",
    "this approach was based on the representation of the solution in terms of the schwarz function , and required discretization and numerical differentiation in order to obtain the perturbation equation .",
    "a discrete form of the perturbation equation was also used by @xcite in their investigation of the linear stability of vortices in a symmetric equilibrium with a circular cylinder and a free stream at infinity .",
    "another family of approaches is based on variational energy arguments going back to kelvin .",
    "they were initially investigated by @xcite , and were more recently pursued by @xcite .",
    "they rely on global properties of the excess energy vs.  velocity impulse diagrams and provide partial information about the linear stability properties without the need to actually perform a full linear stability analysis .",
    "a systematic and general approach to the study of stability of inviscid vortices was recently developed by the present authors @xcite .",
    "it is defined entirely in the continuous setting and relies on the `` shape - differential '' calculus @xcite for a rigorous treatment of boundary deformations and their effect on the linearized evolution .",
    "a starting point of this approach is an equilibrium configuration ( a `` fixed point '' ) of a contour - dynamics formulation of the flow evolution @xcite .",
    "the boundary of the vortex region is then perturbed in the normal direction and the contour - dynamics equations are linearized , via shape differentiation , around the equilibrium configuration . as a result",
    ", a singular integro - differential equation is obtained for the linearized evolution of the normal perturbation .",
    "it is defined on the vortex boundary and the associated eigenvalue problem encodes information about stability .",
    "in contrast to most of the earlier approaches mentioned above , this formulation is general , in the sense that it is not tailored to a particular vortex configuration and does not involve any simplifications ( such as boundary conditions satisfied only approximately or numerical differentiation ) .",
    "it also does not restrict the imposed perturbations to be irrotational .",
    "therefore , the obtained singular integro - differential equation may be considered a vortex - dynamics analogue of the orr - sommerfeld equation used to study the stability of viscous parallel shear flows @xcite .",
    "it was shown by @xcite that the classical stability analyses of @xcite and @xcite can be derived as special cases from the proposed framework . in situations in which the eigenvalue problem is not analytically tractable ,",
    "the integro - differential equation can be approximated numerically with spectral accuracy @xcite .    as regards the stability of hill s vortex , which is the subject of the present study , moffatt & moore made the following remark in their 1978 paper : _",
    "`` ... it is rather remarkable that its stability characteristics have not been investigated in detail''_. in the light of this comment made more than 35 years ago , it is perhaps even more remarkable that important aspects of this problem in fact still remain open .",
    "more precisely , only partial results are available corresponding to the linearized response of hill s vortex to a perturbation applied to its boundary .",
    "@xcite studied the response to axisymmetric perturbations by analyzing an approximate equation for the evolution of the vortex boundary ( a similar approach had been developed earlier by @xcite ) .",
    "they key finding was that the perturbations evolve towards the shape of a sharp `` spike '' localized at the rear stagnation point and directed into or out of the vortex depending on the form of the initial perturbation .",
    "the authors also noted the absence of any oscillatory components in the vortex response .",
    "these observations were confirmed by the computations of @xcite who studied the evolution of disturbances well into the nonlinear regime .",
    "he demonstrated that the spike - like deformation of the vortex boundary arising from the linear instability leads to a significant fluid detrainment or entrainment over longer times .",
    "the response of hill s vortex to general , non - axisymmetric perturbations was studied using approximate techniques based on expansions of the flow variables in spherical harmonics and numerical integration by @xcite .",
    "their main findings were consistent with those of @xcite , namely , that perturbations of the vortex boundary develop into sharp spikes whose number depends on the azimuthal wavenumber of the perturbation .",
    "a number of investigations @xcite studied the stability of hill s vortex with respect to short - wavelength perturbations applied locally and advected by the flow in the spirit of the wkb approach @xcite .",
    "these analyses revealed the presence of a number of instability mechanisms , although they are restricted to the short - wavelength regime . in this context",
    "we also mention the study by @xcite who considered the linear response of the compressible hill s vortex to acoustic waves .",
    "our present investigation attempts to complete the picture by performing , for a first time , a _ global _ spectral stability analysis of hill s vortex with respect to axisymmetric perturbations .",
    "we provide numerical evidence based on highly accurate computations that this problem is not , in fact , well posed in the sense that the eigenfunctions are `` distributions '' ( i.e. , they are not continuous functions of the arclength ) . by considering a sequence of suitably regularized problems and using methods of harmonic analysis it is demonstrated that the eigenfunctions corresponding to , respectively , the unstable and stable modes have the form of infinitely sharp spikes localized at the rear and front stagnation points .",
    "these findings thus refine the conclusions from the earlier approximate computations of @xcite .",
    "we also show that the discrete spectrum corresponding to the stable and unstable modes is complemented by a continuous spectrum of equally non - smooth neutrally - stable eigenmodes .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in the next section we use methods of the shape calculus to derive the stability equation ; in  [ sec : numer ] we describe and validate the numerical approach , whereas computational results are presented in ",
    "[ sec : results ] ; the results are discussed in  [ sec : discuss ] and final comments are deferred to ",
    "[ sec : final ] .",
    "in this section we first provide details of the contour - dynamics formulation in the 3d axisymmetric geometry which is the basis of our approach .",
    "then , methods of shape calculus are used to derive an integro - differential equation characterizing the stability of hill s vortex . finally , we discuss some properties of this equation .",
    "hereafter @xmath29 will denote the projection of the axisymmetric vortex region @xmath13 onto the meridional plane @xmath30 .",
    "the formalism of contour dynamics is a convenient way to study the evolution of inviscid flows with piecewise smooth vorticity distributions @xcite . given a time - dependent region @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is time , its evolution can be studied by tracking the points @xmath33 on its boundary @xmath34 via the equation @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a suitable biot - savart kernel , @xmath37 and @xmath38",
    "are defined in the absolute frame of reference and @xmath39 is an arclength element of the vortex boundary in the meridional plane .",
    "an equilibrium shape of the vortex boundary , denoted @xmath40 ( without the argument @xmath32 ) , can be characterized by transforming the coordinates to the translating frame of reference @xmath41 and considering the normal component of equation @xmath42 = 0 ,   \\label{eq : vn}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 denotes the unit vector normal to the contour @xmath40 at the point @xmath44 ( hereafter we will use the convention that a subscript on a geometric quantity will indicate where this quantity is evaluated ) . since we have @xmath45 , the arguments of the kernel @xmath46 in can be changed to @xmath44 and @xmath47 .",
    "equation expresses the vanishing of the normal velocity component on the vortex boundary in relative equilibrium .",
    "since the equilibrium shape of the boundary @xmath40 is in general a priori unknown , relation reveals the free - boundary aspect of the problem .",
    "the biot - savart kernel was derived by @xcite with an alternative , but equivalent , formulation also given by @xcite . here",
    "we will use this kernel in the form rederived and tested by @xcite @xmath48\\ , \\e_x + \\\\ & \\sigma '   h(x , x',\\sigma,\\sigma ' ) \\ , \\cos\\theta ' \\ , \\e_{\\sigma } , \\end{aligned } \\label{eq : k}\\ ] ] where @xmath49\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath50 whereas @xmath51 denotes the polar angle of the point @xmath47 , i.e. , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind , respectively @xcite .",
    "we note that @xmath56 as @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and at @xmath59 function @xmath54 has a logarithmic singularity ( more details about the singularity structure of kernel will be provided below ) .",
    "in addition to the circulation , impulse and energy conserved by all classical solutions of euler s equations , axisymmetric inviscid flows also conserve casimirs @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is an arbitrary function with sufficient regularity @xcite .",
    "since circulation is particularly important from the physical point of view , we will focus on stability analysis with respect to perturbations preserving this quantity , which is the same approach as was also taken by @xcite .",
    "circulation @xmath62 of the flow in the meridional plane is defined as @xmath63 and can be also viewed as the casimir corresponding to @xmath64 .",
    "we add that , since the flows considered here have the property @xmath65 , cf .",
    " , conservation of circulation implies the conservation of the volume of the vortical region .    following the ideas laid out by @xcite",
    ", we introduce a parameterization of the contour @xmath66 in terms of its arclength @xmath67 .",
    "we will also adopt the convention that the superscript @xmath68 , where @xmath69 , will denote quantities corresponding to the perturbed boundary , so that @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the quantities corresponding to the ( relative ) equilibrium .",
    "then , points on the perturbed vortex boundary can be represented as follows @xmath72 where @xmath73 represents the `` shape '' of the perturbation .",
    "we note that , without affecting the final result , @xmath74 in the last term in could be replaced with its perturbed counterpart @xmath75 . using equation",
    "we thus deduce @xmath76 ,   \\label{eq : vne}\\ ] ] from which the equilibrium condition is obtained by setting @xmath77 .",
    "the perturbation equation is obtained by linearizing relation around the equilibrium configuration characterized by which is equivalent to expanding in powers of @xmath68 and retaining the first - order terms . since equation involves perturbed quantities defined on the perturbed vortex boundary @xmath78 , the proper way to obtain this linearization is using methods of the shape - differential calculus @xcite .",

    "@xmath187.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the dependence of the four purely imaginary eigenvalues on the resolution @xmath184 is shown in figures [ fig : imlam](a  d ) , where we see that the eigenvalues all converge to well - defined limits .",
    "however , as will be discussed below , problem does not admit smooth solutions ( eigenvectors ) and therefore the convergence of eigenvalues @xmath188 with @xmath184 is only algebraic rather than spectral .",
    "thus , the numerical approximation error for an eigenvalue @xmath114 can be represented as @xmath189 for some @xmath190 and @xmath191 . using the data from figure [ fig : imlam ] to evaluate @xmath192 as a function of the resolution @xmath184 , one can estimate the order of convergence using a least - squares fit as @xmath193 for the first eigenvalue ( both stable and unstable ) and @xmath194 for the second ( both stable and unstable ) .",
    "this confirms that the first eigenvalues converge much faster than the second .",
    "the dependence of the purely real eigenvalues on the resolution @xmath184 is illustrated in figures [ fig : relam](a  b ) .",
    "first of all , we notice that the purely real eigenvalues do not appear to converge to any particular limit as @xmath184 is increased and instead fill the interval of the axis @xmath195 with increasing density ( figure [ fig : relam](b ) ) . from figure",
    "[ fig : relam](a ) we can infer that the lower and upper bounds of this interval approximately scale with the resolution as @xmath196 \\sim n^{-0.22 }   \\quad \\text{and } \\quad   \\max_i \\left[|\\re(\\lambda_i^n)|\\right ] \\sim n^{1.04 } , \\quad i=1,\\dots , n , \\label{eq : lm}\\ ] ] where @xmath197 denotes the @xmath198-th eigenvalue computed with the resolution @xmath184 .",
    "all these observations allow us to conclude that the continuous eigenvalue problem has four purely imaginary eigenvalues and a continuous spectrum coinciding with the axis @xmath186 .",
    "we now move on to discuss the eigenvectors corresponding to the purely imaginary eigenvalues .",
    "the linearly unstable and stable eigenvectors are shown as functions of the polar angle @xmath91 for different resolutions @xmath184 in figures [ fig : evec_n_th](a  d ) . in these figures",
    "we only show the real parts of the eigenvectors , since given our ansatz for the perturbation , the imaginary parts do not play any role when the eigenvalues are purely imaginary .",
    "hence , below the term `` eigenvector '' will refer to @xmath199 .",
    "we note that , as the resolution @xmath184 increases , the unstable and stable eigenvectors associated with a given eigenvalue become reflections of each other with respect to the midpoint @xmath200 with the unstable eigenvectors exhibiting a localized peak near the rear stagnation point ( @xmath201 ) and the stable eigenvectors exhibiting such a peak near the front stagnation point ( @xmath202 ) . in figures [ fig : evec_n_th](a  d ) we also observe that , for a fixed regularization parameter @xmath179 , the numerical approximations @xmath199 of eigenfunctions converge uniformly in @xmath91 for increasing @xmath184 , although this convergence is significantly slower for points @xmath91 close to the endpoint opposite to where the eigenvector exhibits a peak .",
    "we remark that the same behaviour of spectral approximations to eigenfunctions was also observed by @xcite .",
    "the two unstable eigenvectors @xmath203 and @xmath204 are strongly non - normal with @xmath205 , where @xmath206 and @xmath207 are respectively the inner product and the norm in the space @xmath208 , when @xmath209 and @xmath210 . consequently , the two unstable eigenvectors appear quite similar as functions of @xmath91 , especially near the peak ( cf .  figures [ fig : evec_n_th](a  b ) ) . on the other hand , the fourier spectra of their expansion coefficients shown in figures [ fig : evec_n_sp](a  b )",
    "exhibit quite distinct properties .",
    "more specifically , we see that the slope of the fourier spectra for @xmath211 is quite different in the two cases : it is close to @xmath212 and @xmath213 for the eigenvectors associated with , respectively , the first and second eigenvalue .",
    "we emphasize however that the specific slopes are determined by the choice of the parameter @xmath172 in the regularizing operator and here we are interested in the relative difference of the slopes in the two cases .",
    "further distinctions between the eigenvectors associated with the first and the second eigenvalue will be elucidated below when discussing their behavior in the limit of decreasing regularization parameter @xmath179 .",
    "having established the convergence of the numerical approximations of the eigenfunctions with the resolution @xmath184 for a fixed regularization parameter @xmath179 , we now go on to characterize their behaviour when @xmath179 is decreased . unless indicated otherwise ,",
    "the results presented below were obtained with the resolution @xmath210 . in figures [ fig : evec_kc_th](a  b ) we show the behavior of the two unstable eigenvectors near the rear and front stagnation points for different values of the regularization parameter @xmath179 .",
    "we see that , as this parameter is decreased , the peak near the rear stagnation point ( figure [ fig : evec_kc_th](a ) ) becomes steeper and more localized , especially for the eigenvector associated with the first eigenvalue .",
    "likewise , the oscillation of the unstable eigenvectors near the front stagnation point ( figure [ fig : evec_kc_th](b ) ) also becomes more intense and localized as @xmath179 decreases , although this effect is more pronounced in the case of the eigenvector corresponding to the second eigenvalue .",
    "these properties are further characterized in the plots of the fourier spectra of the two eigenvectors shown in figures [ fig : evec_kc_sp](a  b ) for different values of the regularization parameter @xmath179 . in these plots",
    "it is clear that , as the regularization effect vanishes ( corresponding to decreasing values of @xmath179 ) , the point where the slope of the spectrum changes moves towards larger wavenumbers @xmath122 . for @xmath214",
    "the approximate slopes of the coefficient spectra are , respectively , @xmath215 and @xmath216 for the eigenvectors associated with the first and second eigenvalue ( this difference of slopes may explain the different behaviors in the physical space already observed in figure [ fig : evec_kc_th](b ) ) . extrapolating from the trends evident in figures [ fig : evec_kc_sp](a  b ) it can be expected that these slopes will remain unchanged in the limit @xmath217 . with this behaviour of the fourier coefficients , involving no decay at all for the first eigenvector and a slow decay for the second , expansion does not converge in the limit of @xmath218 , indicating that the stable and unstable eigenvectors do not have the form of smooth functions , but rather `` distributions '' . as regards the nature of their singularity , the slopes observed in figures [ fig : evec_kc_sp](a  b ) , i.e. , @xmath215 and @xmath216 , indicate that the eigenvector associated with the first eigenvalue is consistent with the dirac delta ( whose spectral slope is also 0 ) , whereas the eigenvector associated with the second eigenvalue is intermediate between the dirac delta and the heaviside step function ( whose spectral slope is -1 ) .    finally , we go on to discuss the eigenvectors associated with the purely real eigenvalues forming the continuous part of the spectrum .",
    "since , as demonstrated in figure [ fig : relam ] , for increasing resolutions @xmath184 different eigenvalues are actually computed in the continuous spectrum , there is no sense of convergence with @xmath184 .",
    "we will therefore analyze here the effect of decreasing the regularization parameter @xmath179 at a fixed resolution @xmath210 .",
    "as above , we will focus on the real parts of the eigenvectors ( with the imaginary parts having similar properties ) .",
    "to fix attention , we consider the neutrally - stable eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue @xmath219 . in figure",
    "[ fig : neut_th ] we show the dependence of @xmath220 on the polar angle @xmath91 with @xmath210 and for different values of the regularization parameter @xmath179 .",
    "we observe that as @xmath179 decreases the oscillations move away from the centre of the domain @xmath118 $ ] towards the endpoints .",
    "the number of oscillations , however , remains approximately constant .",
    "the corresponding fourier coefficient spectra are shown in figures [ fig : neut_sp](a  d ) .",
    "we see in these plots that the fourier coefficients increase with @xmath122 as @xmath221 when @xmath214 which demonstrates that the neutrally - stable eigenvectors are actually more singular objects than the stable and unstable eigenvectors discussed above .",
    "we note that in the regularized regime ( i.e. , for @xmath222 ) the fourier coefficient spectrum of the neutrally - stable eigenvectors vanishes with the slope of -7 , see figure [ fig : evec_kc_sp](d ) . extrapolating from the trends evident in figures [ fig : neut_th ] and [ fig : neut_sp ] to the limit @xmath176 , we can anticipate that the neutrally - stable eigenfunctions will have the form of a finite number of oscillations localized in an infinitesimal neighbourhood of the stagnation points @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",

    "in this section we first provide a simple argument to justify the numerical results obtained in  [ sec : results ] and then make some comparisons with the results of earlier studies .",
    "some properties of the eigenvectors discussed in  [ sec : results ] are consequences of the `` degeneracy '' of the stability operator . more specifically , knowing the streamfunction field characterizing hill s vortex , the coefficient of the derivative term on the rhs in can be expressed as @xmath226 which vanishes at the endpoints @xmath227 . to illustrate the effect of this degeneracy we will consider a simplified model problem obtained from by dropping the integral terms and rescaling the coefficients , so that we obtain @xmath228 \\label{eq : sindudt}\\ ] ] for some @xmath229 .",
    "we now perform a change of variables @xmath230 defined through @xmath231 , so that @xmath232 where the lower integration bound was chosen to make the transformation antisymmetric with respect to the midpoint of the interval @xmath118 $ ] .",
    "transformation has the properties @xmath233 and @xmath234 , such that it represents a one - to - one map from the interval @xmath118 $ ] to the real line . introducing this change of variables in equation , we obtain",
    "@xmath235 it then follows from and that equation admits a continuous spectrum coinciding with the entire complex plane @xmath112 with the eigenfunctions given by @xmath236 . when the eigenvalues are restricted to the real line @xmath237 , the corresponding eigenfunctions @xmath229 exhibit oscillations with wavelengths decreasing as @xmath238 , as was also observed in ",
    "[ sec : results ] for the neutrally - stable modes , cf .",
    "figure [ fig : neut_th ] . on the other hand , for purely imaginary eigenvalues @xmath239 , where @xmath240 , the corresponding eigenfunctions take the form @xmath241 which for @xmath242 has the properties @xmath243 and @xmath244 consistent with the singular behaviour of the unstable eigenmodes observed in ",
    "[ sec : results ] , cf .",
    "figures [ fig : evec_n_th ] and [ fig : evec_kc_th ] .",
    "thus , one can conclude that the singular structure of the eigenvectors is a consequence of the degeneracy of the coefficient in front of the derivative term in and some qualitative insights about this issue can be deduced based on the simplified problem .",
    "we add that similar problems are known to arise in hydrodynamic stability , for example , in the context of the inviscid rayleigh equation describing the stability of plane parallel flows @xcite . in that problem",
    ", however , the singularity appears inside the domain giving rise to critical layers with locations dependent on the eigenvalues .",
    "we now return to a remark made in introduction , namely , that hill s vortices represent a one - parameter family of solutions parameterized by the constant @xmath24 , or equivalently , by the translation velocity @xmath7 , cf .  .",
    "we remark that the stability operator defined in is linear in @xmath24 which implies that eigenvalues @xmath114 ( and hence also the growth rates ) will be proportional to @xmath24 ( or @xmath7 ) .",
    "this is also consistent with the observations made by @xcite .",
    "next we compare our findings with the results of @xcite which concerned essentially the same problem .",
    "we remark that these results were verified computationally by @xcite .",
    "the exponential growth rate of the unstable perturbations predicted by @xcite was ( using our present notation ) @xmath245 which is in excellent agreement with the first unstable eigenvalue found here , cf .",
    "figure [ fig : imlam](a ) .",
    "similar agreement was found as regards the structure of the most unstable perturbation  @xcite also found it to have the form of a localized spike at the rear stagnation point ( the fact that this spike had a finite width seems related to the truncation of the infinite system of ordinary differential equations ) .",
    "it appears that the second unstable mode , cf .",
    "figure [ fig : evec_n_th](b ) , was undetected by the analysis of @xcite due to its smaller growth rate , cf .",
    "figure [ fig : imlam](b ) .    to close this section , we comment on the continuous part of the spectrum which was reported in ",
    "[ sec : results ] , cf .",
    "figures [ fig : sp ] and [ fig : relam ] .",
    "such continuous spectra often appear in the study of infinite - dimensional hamiltonian , or more generally , non self - adjoint systems , where nontrivial effects may arise from its interaction with the discrete spectrum @xcite . in the present problem , however ,",
    "the results of @xcite and @xcite indicate that the observed instability has the form of a purely modal growth which can be completely explained in terms of the discrete spectrum and the associated eigenfunctions .",
    "moreover , this is confirmed by the very good agreement between the growth rate of the instability determined by @xcite and the value of the first unstable eigenvalue obtained in our study .",
    "these observations thus allow us to conclude that there is no evidence for any role the continuous spectrum might play in the observed instability mechanism .",
    "in this study we have considered the linear stability of hill s vortex with respect to axisymmetric circulation - preserving perturbations .",
    "this was done using the systematic approach of @xcite to obtain an eigenvalue problem characterizing the linearized evolution of perturbations to the shape of the vortex boundary .",
    "recognizing that the euler equation describing the evolution of discontinuous vorticity distributions gives rise to a _ free - boundary _ problem , our approach was based on shape differentiation of the contour - dynamics formulation in the 3d axisymmetric geometry @xcite . as such",
    ", it did not involve the simplifications invoked in the earlier studies of this problem by @xcite which were related to , e.g. , approximate only satisfaction of the kinematic conditions on the vortex boundary .",
    "the resulting singular integro - differential operator was approximated with a spectral method in which the integral expressions were evaluated analytically and using chebfun .",
    "we considered a sequence of regularized eigenvalue problems featuring smooth eigenfunctions for which the convergence of the numerical approximation was established .",
    "then , the original problem was recovered in the limit of vanishing regularization parameter @xmath179 . since in the limit",
    "@xmath217 the eigenfunctions were found to be distributions , the convergence of this approach with the resolution @xmath184 was not very fast , but it did provide a precise characterization of their regularity in terms of the rate of decay of the fourier coefficients in expansion . following this procedure we showed that the stability operator has four purely imaginary eigenvalues , associated with two unstable and two stable eigenmodes , in addition to a continuous spectrum of purely real eigenvalues associated with neutrally - stable eigenmodes .",
    "the two unstable eigenmodes are distributions in the form of infinitely sharp peaks localized at the rear stagnation point and differ by their degree of singularity .",
    "the stable eigenmodes have the form of similar peaks localized at the front stagnation point .",
    "on the other hand , the neutrally - stable eigenvectors have the form of `` wiggles '' concentrated in a vanishing neighbourhood of the two stagnation points with the number of oscillations increasing with the eigenvalue magnitude @xmath223 .",
    "our results are consistent with the findings from the earlier studies of this problem by @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that these earlier studies did not , however , solve the complete linear stability problem and only considered the linearized evolution of some prescribed initial perturbation ( they can be therefore regarded as evaluating the action of an operator ( matrix ) on a vector , rather than determining all of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors ) .",
    "these studies did conclude that initial perturbations evolve towards a sharp peak concentrated near the rear stagnation point .",
    "thus , our present findings may be interpreted as sharpening the results of these earlier studies . in particular ,",
    "excellent agreement was found with the growth rate of the unstable perturbations found by @xcite .",
    "the findings of the present study lead to some intriguing questions concerning the initial - value problem for the evolution of hill s vortex with a perturbed boundary .",
    "it appears that , in the continuous setting without any regularization , this problem may not be well - posed , in the sense that , for generic initial perturbations , the vortex boundary may exhibit the same poor regularity as observed for the unstable eigenvectors in  [ sec : results ] ( i.e. , be at least discontinuous ) . while it is possible that the nonlinearity might exert some regularizing effect , this is an aspect of the problem which should be taken into account in its numerical solution .",
    "a standard numerical approach to the solution of such problems is the axisymmetric version of the `` contour dynamics '' method @xcite in which the discretization of the contour boundary with straight segments or circular arcs combined with an approximation of the singular integrals provide the required regularizing effect . on the other hand ,",
    "the singular structure of the solution can be captured more readily with higher - order methods , such as the spectral approach developed here .",
    "there is a number of related problems which deserve attention and will be considered in the near future .",
    "a natural extension of the questions addressed here is to investigate the stability of hill s vortex with respect to non - axisymmetric perturbations , as already explored by @xcite .",
    "another interesting question is to consider the effect of swirl @xcite .",
    "hill s vortex is a member of the norbury - fraenkel family of inviscid vortex rings and their stability remains an open problem .",
    "it was argued by @xcite that the highly localized nature of the boundary response of hill s vortex to perturbations is a consequence of the presence of a stagnation point . since the norbury - fraenkel vortices other than hill s vortex do not feature stagnation points on the vortex boundary , it may be conjectured that in those cases eigenfunctions of the stability operator will be smooth functions of the arclength coordinate .",
    "therefore , in the context of the linear stability problem , the family of the norbury - fraenkel vortex rings may be regarded as a `` regularization '' of hill s vortex analogous and alternative to our approach developed in  [ sec : numer ] , cf .  . the different problems mentioned in this paragraph , except for the effect of swirl ,",
    "can be investigated using the approach developed by @xcite and also employed in the present study .",
    "as regards the stability of hill s vortex with swirl , the difficulty stems from the fact that , to the best of our knowledge , there is currently no vortex - dynamics formulation of the type available for axisymmetric flows with swirl .",
    "our next step will be to analyze the stability of the norbury - fraenkel vortex rings to axisymmetric perturbations .",
    "finally , it will also be interesting to compare the present findings with the results of the short - wavelength stability analysis of @xcite .",
    "in particular , one would like to know if there is any overlap between the two stability analyses and , if so , whether they can produce comparable predictions of the growth rates .",
