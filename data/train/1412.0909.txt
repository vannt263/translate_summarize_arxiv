    "the flows through porous medium are very much prevalent in nature and therefore , the study of such flows has become of principal interest in many scientific and engineering applications @xcite .",
    "this type of flows has shown their great importance in petroleum engineering to study the movements of natural gas , oil and water through the oil reservoirs ; in chemical engineering for the filtration and water purification processes .",
    "further , to study the underground water resources and seepage of water in river beds one need the knowledge of the fluid flow through porous medium",
    ". therefore , there are number of practical uses of the fluid flow through porous media .",
    "the porous medium is in fact a non - homogeneous medium but for the sake of analysis , it may be possible to replace it with a homogeneous fluid which has dynamical properties equal to those of non - homogeneous continuum . thus one can study the flow of hypothetical fluid under the action of the properly averaged external flow and the complicated problem of the flow through a porous medium reduces to the flow problem of homogeneous fluid with some additional resistance@xcite . in this work , we considered incompressible viscous fluid flow in porous medium between two porous plates .",
    "we assumed that the plates are parallel , horizontal and stationary .",
    "we applied injection at the lower plate and suction at upper see ( hinvi et al.@xcite ) .",
    "the objective is to study the effect of reynolds number @xmath0 and permeability parameter @xmath1 introduced in navier - stokes equations by the small suction velocity and permeability of medium , on the stability of the poiseuille flow in porous medium as in ( hinvi et al.(@xciteand @xcite ) ) . for this as in previous paper , we derive fourth - order equations named modified fourth - order orr - sommerfeld equations governing the stability analysis of poiseuille flow in porous medium .",
    "this allowed us to see the simultanous effect of @xmath2 or @xmath0 and medium permeability parameter @xmath1 on the stability in the boundary layer .",
    "thus , we solve numerically the corresponding eigenvalues problems .",
    "we employ matlab in all our numerical computations to find eigenvalues .",
    "such attempt has been made earlier by monwanou et al .",
    "@xcite the case of the non - porous plate boundary layers ( a flat plate - law ) without wall suction by normalizing all the components of the velocity with the free stream velocity @xmath3 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the second section the mathematical formulation of the problem",
    "is made . in the third section the modified orr - sommerfeld equation governing the stability analysis of poiseuille flow in porous medium",
    "is deduced . in the fourth section",
    ", the effects of small injection / suction parameter @xmath0 , wave number @xmath4 and permeability parameter @xmath5 on linear stability of poiseuille flow in porous medium will be investigated with the help of figures .",
    "the conclusions will be presented in the final section .",
    "we considered a poiseuille viscous incompressible fluid flow between a porous me - dium .",
    "we assumed the medium isotrope see figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the two porous parallel plates delimiters are assumed of infinite lengh , distant @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath7 axis is normal to the planes of the plates .",
    "we considered the simple case where , the permeability parameter @xmath1 and velocities suction and injection are constants .",
    "we work at constant temperature , the heat transfer aspect of the flow is not studied .",
    "the small constant injection @xmath8 is applied at the lower plate and a same small constant suction @xmath8 , at the upper plate .",
    "the two plates are fixed .",
    "we choose the origine on the plane @xmath9 such as @xmath10 and @xmath11 parallel to the direction of the mean fluid flow .",
    "initially , @xmath12 , the fluid is assumed to be at rest . when @xmath13 , the fluid starts moving .",
    "the porous medium is infact a non - homogeneous medium but for the sake of analysis , it may be possible to replace it with a homogeneous continuum .",
    "thus , one can study the flow of hypothetical homogeneous fluid under the action of the properly averaged external forces .",
    "thus , a complicated problem of the flow through a porous medium reduces to the flow problem of a homogeneous fluid with some resistance .",
    "then the equations of fluid flow in porous medium are simply the equations of fluid flow in homogeneous medium see ( [ fig:2 ] ) added the permeability term .",
    "extra force terms as compared to non - porous medium fluid are added on @xmath14 of navie - stokes equations for homogeneous medium , due to the permeability medium .",
    "we can treat porous medium fluid as a single fluid under assumption that there is a permeability term to added .",
    "the equations of continuity , motion for the viscous incompressible fluid in porous medium are    @xmath15    we introduced the following non - dimensional quantities as in ( hinvi et al.(@xcite )    @xmath16    @xmath17    @xmath18    @xmath19    then the eqs.([1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) become in cartesien cordinates : @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23",
    "the flow is decomposed into the mean flow and the deviation from it ( the disturbance ) according to @xmath24 @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the spatial coordinate vector .    inserting ( [ a1 ] ) and ( [ a2 ] ) into the navier - stokes equations ( [ 3])- ( [ 6 ] ) we obtain the equations following .",
    "@xmath27    @xmath28    @xmath29    @xmath30    we take the dimensional base flow for small suction and injection see ( hinvi et al.@xcite ) : @xmath31 to obtain the stability equations for the spatial evolution of three - dimensional , we take the dependent on time disturbances @xmath32 which are scaled in the same way as above .    with the equations ( [ a6]-[a9 ] ) ,",
    "the equations ( [ 7]-[10 ] ) become    @xmath33    @xmath34    @xmath35    @xmath36    the equations ( [ 11]-[14 ] ) above are the linear disturbance equations that model the poi - seuille flow of the incompressible viscous fluid in porous medium with the assumption that there is a constant small suction at upper plate and a constant small injection at the lower plate in cartesien coordinates .",
    "in this section the modified orr - sommerfeld equation governing the stability analysis of poiseuille flow in porous medium is deduced by using navier - stokes equations with the same strategy as ( see hinvi et al.@xcite ) . by using continuity equation ,",
    "the pressure terms can be eliminated from ( [ 11])-([14 ] ) , by reducing the system to two equations for two unknown quantities . for a mean profile ( [ a6]-[a8 ] ) ,",
    "the divergence of ( [ 11])-([14 ] ) and continuity gives @xmath37    we applied @xmath38 to the equation ( [ 12 ] ) , unsing ( [ 15 ] ) we found @xmath39 by neglecting the quadratic derivation ( because of linear stability analysis ) the equation ( [ 16 ] ) becomes    @xmath40    we transform the eq.([16 ] ) in an eigenvalue problem .",
    "thus , the disturbances are taken to be periodic in time in the streamwise , spanwise directions , which allow us to assume solutions of the form    @xmath41    where @xmath42 represents either one of the disturbances @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 or @xmath46 and @xmath47 the amplitude function , @xmath4 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the wave numbers , @xmath50 is the frequency of the wave . with @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 wave velocity which is taken to be complex , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are real because of temporal stability analysis considered .    then with the equation ( [ 18 ] ) the equation ( [ 17 ] ) becomes @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "we have a same boundary conditions @xmath58 as in ( hinvi et al.@xcite ) .",
    "to transform these boundary conditions to @xmath59 we make the change , by puting @xmath60 the equation ( [ 19 ] ) becomes then @xmath61\\hat{v}_{p } & = & \\nonumber\\\\   c \\left ( d^{2}-k^{2}\\right)\\hat{v}_{p}\\label{21 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with boundary conditions for all @xmath62 : @xmath63    the eq.([21 ] ) is a flow equation modified by suction reynolds number @xmath64 ( or the speed of suction and injection ) and permeability parameter @xmath65 , which differentiated it , from the model study by ( hinvi et al.@xcite ) by permeability term , rewritten as an eigenvalue problem , where @xmath66 is the eigenvalue and @xmath67 the eigenfunction .",
    "@xmath68    and @xmath69 are the operators .",
    "we consider three - dimensional disturbances .",
    "we use a temporal stability analysis as mentioned above . with @xmath66 complex as we have defined above , when @xmath70 we have stability , @xmath71 we have neutral stability and elsewhere we have instability .",
    "we employ matlab @xmath72 in all our numerical computations to find the eigenvalues .",
    "the mean flow profile for poiseuille flow in porous medium is @xmath73 for @xmath0 small ( i.e. small suction ) is considered ( see @xcite ) the eigenvalue problem ( [ 21])-[22 ] ) is solved numerically with the suitable boundary conditions .",
    "the solutions are found in a layer bounded at @xmath74 .",
    "the results of calculations are presented in the figures below .",
    "we present the figures related to the eigenvalue problem . for all figure we ploted @xmath75 by fixing the other parameters .",
