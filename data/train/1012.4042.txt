    "in order to detect the gravitational waves , which are oscillations of spacetime itself , several ground - based detectors , such as ligo , virgo , tama300 , and geo600 , are in operation and there are some projects to build the next generation of detector @xcite . in addition to the ground - based detectors , it is also considering to launch detectors in space like lisa @xcite and decigo @xcite . since the permeability of gravitational waves could be extremely strong",
    ", one can expect to see raw information of the wave sources via gravitational waves . on the other hand",
    ", the most promising sources of gravitational waves might be supernovae and mergers of binary compact objects , i.e. , the gravitational waves are related to the compact stars , around which the gravitational field should be strong .",
    "so , the direct detection of gravitational waves could enable us not only to collect the astronomical data and to reveal the true properties of dense matter @xcite , but also to prove the gravitational theory in the strong - field regime @xcite .",
    "in fact , an attempt to estimate the stellar parameters , such as mass , radius , and equation of state ( eos ) , via their oscillation properties is not a brand - new idea . in astronomy",
    ", the helioseismology has been already established and one could see the interior information of our sun through its oscillation properties . since the late 1990s , it has been suggested possible to reveal the compact star properties with observing the oscillation spectra , which is called gravitational wave asteroseismology @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the detailed analysis of the emitted gravitational waves might permit us to determine the radius of accretion disk around supermassive black hole @xcite or to see the magnetic effect during the stellar collapse @xcite .",
    "with respect to the neutron stars , the density in the vicinity of the stellar center could become much more than the standard nuclear density , which is around @xmath1 @xmath2 .",
    "since such high density can not be realized on the earth , the detailed matter properties in the neutron stars are still unknown .",
    "however , this means conversely that the neutron stars can be good candidates to know the matter properties in the extreme high density region , where it is suggested that the exotic components of matter , such as hyperons , meson condensates , and quark matter , could appear @xcite .",
    "the existence of these exotic matter changes the eos and neutron star structures dramatically @xcite .",
    "namely , as mentioned the above , observing the stellar oscillations and/or the corresponding gravitational waves will tell us the information about the matter properties of neutron stars .",
    "especially , it might be impossible to probe the true properties of matter deep inside the star by any other experiments .",
    "the hyperons are considered to appear at around @xmath3 , if the nuclear matter would be in beta - equilibrium @xcite . on the other hand , there are still many uncertainties with respect to the hadron - quark phase transition , e.g. , the eos of quark matter or a deconfinement mechanism",
    ". the presence of quark matter inside the compact objects might play an important role in the astronomical phenomena , for example the backbending effect from phase transition @xcite , connection to gamma - ray bursts @xcite , the gravitational wave bursts @xcite , the gravitational radiation @xcite , the energy release during the collapse from neutron stars to quark stars @xcite , the neutrino luminosities  @xcite , and cooling with quark matter @xcite . although the simplest model with the quark matter would be the maxwell construction , around critical density to appear the quark matter",
    "the mixed phase could exist , where baryon number and electric charge should be conserved .",
    "generally , the properties of the mixed phase depend strongly on the electromagnetic interaction and the surface tension , which effects are called  _ the finite - size effects _ \" . due to the finite - size effects , the mixed phase is composed of the nonuniform pasta structure @xcite .",
    "however , it has not been clear how to distinguish the finite size effects by observing the astronomical phenomena .    in this article , we study the gravitational waves emitted from compact stars with the hadron - quark mixed phase considering the finite size effects . up to now , there exist a few studies from the gravitational wave asteroseismological point of view , which focus on probing the density discontinuity in the high density region with using specific frequencies of gravitational waves ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , no one investigates the effects of the mixed phase between the hadron and quark matter on the specific frequencies .",
    "so , in this article , preparing the neutron star models with the mixed phase or with density discontinuity between the hadron and quark matter phases , we will calculate the eigenfrequencies associated with the gravitational waves , where as a first step we adopt the cowling approximation , i.e. , the metric perturbation will be neglected . then , as varying the stellar properties systematically , we will see the dependence of the existence of quark matter on the oscillation frequencies considering finite size effects .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the equation system to construct the neutron star models and the adopted eos in this article , and show some stellar models concretely . in section [ sec : iii ] , we derive the perturbation equations with cowling approximation . with appropriate boundary conditions ,",
    "the problem to solve becomes the eigenvalue problem .",
    "then the obtained oscillation spectra will be shown in section [ sec : iv ] .",
    "at last , we make a conclusion in section [ sec : v ] . in this article",
    ", we adopt the unit of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the speed of light and the gravitational constant , respectively , and the metric signature is @xmath7 .",
    "the equilibrium configurations of non - rotating relativistic stars are spherically symmetric solutions of the well - known tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations .",
    "the metric can be expressed as @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are metric functions with respect to @xmath11 . a mass function @xmath12",
    "are defined as @xmath13 , which satisfies @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the energy density , while the tov equations to determine the distributions of the pressure @xmath16 and metric function @xmath17 are described as @xmath18 to close the equation system , one needs an additional equation , i.e. , the equation of state ( eos ) .    in this article",
    ", we adopt the eos with the hadron - quark mixed phase with hyperons considering finite size effects according to @xcite .",
    "our eos for hadron is in the framework of the nonrelativistic brueckner - hartree - fock approach including hyperons such as @xmath19 and @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "it is not clear now whether the @xmath19-@xmath20 interaction is repulsive or not  @xcite , while we use here a weak but attractive interaction",
    ". it would be interesting to see how our results are changed by using the other @xmath19-@xmath20 interactions , and we will discuss it in the future work . for the comparisons , we also adopt the eos composed of only nucleon .",
    "we called them as  hyperon eos \" and  nucleon eos \" in this article .",
    "for the quark phase , we adopt the mit bag model .",
    "it should be noticed that the adopted eos in this article is not simple mit bag model but more sophisticated models suggested in the previous articles @xcite .",
    "assuming massless @xmath21 and @xmath22 quarks and @xmath23 quarks with the current mass of @xmath24 mev , we set the bag constant @xmath25 to be 100  mev @xmath2 .    for the mixed phase , we assume non - uniform structures , so - called  pastas \" . in practice ,",
    "the structures such as droplet , rod , slab , tube , and bubble are considered .",
    "we use the local density approximation for particles using the wigner - seitz cell . in order to construct such pasta phase",
    ", we put a sharp boundary with a constant surface tension parameter between the hadron and quark phases .",
    "then the gibbs conditions are imposed , where one needs to solve the chemical equilibrium among particles in two phases consistent with the coulomb potential , and a pressure balance consistent with the surface tension in self - consistently .",
    "although the knowledge of the value of the surface tension at the hadron - quark interface is very poor , some theoretical estimations have done and they suggest that the value of surface tension is around @xmath26 mev/@xmath27 @xcite . since one can see that the models with @xmath28 mev/@xmath27 are almost same as that with @xmath29 mev/@xmath27 , in this article we consider only a range of @xmath30 mev/@xmath27 . as the extreme case",
    ", we also consider the eos with the maxwell construction , which has the sharp discontinuity of the density between @xmath31 and @xmath32 g/@xmath33 .",
    "note that this discontinuity appears at strong surface tensions considering the finite size effects , e.g. , @xmath34 mev/@xmath27 in our previous study  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we take into account another extreme case of the eos with the bulk gibbs condition , which appears at the zero surface tension limit @xcite .",
    "finally , in order to determine which structure is most favored in the mixed phase , we compare the energy among the pasta structures .",
    "it notes that we do not take into account the anti - particles and muons in this article , because their effects should not be so important .",
    "then the above eoss should be connected to the hadronic eos proposed by negele and vautherin @xcite when the density become lower than around @xmath35 g/@xmath33 . in table",
    "[ tab : eos ] , the components of each eos adopted in this article are summarized , while fig .",
    "[ fig : eos ] shows the relationship between the energy density @xmath15 and the pressure @xmath36 in the higher density region for the adopted eoss in this article . solving the tov equations with such eoss",
    ", we can get the stellar properties as fig .",
    "[ fig : mr ] .",
    "it should be noticed that the maximum masses of the stellar models composed of eos including the quark matter are almost independent from the value of @xmath37 , which are around @xmath0 . at the end of this section",
    ", we should mention about the maximum mass of neutron stars .",
    "recently two pulsar mass measurements appeared , which are well above @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath38 for psr j1614 - 2230 @xcite and @xmath39 for psr j1903 + 0327 @xcite .",
    "since it is impossible to explain these evidences with the eos including the quark matter adopted in this article , we should derive more realistic eos and examine the stellar oscillations as a future work .",
    ".components of each eos adopted in this article and the references . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we study how to distinguish the finite effects on the hadron - quark mixed phase by observing the gravitational waves , for which we derive the perturbation equations of neutron stars and obtain their eigenfrequencies .",
    "we find that one could know the existence of density discontinuity inside the star via observing the gravitational waves of not only @xmath40 mode but also @xmath41 mode .",
    "note that this discontinuity comes from the instability of the mixed phase due to the strong surface tension .",
    "additionally , it is possible to see the stellar properties by observing the @xmath40 mode frequency , since such frequency can be expressed well as a function of the stellar compactness .",
    "if the eos do not include the density discontinuity , it might be difficult to distinguish the eos only by observing the @xmath41 mode frequencies .",
    "however , the normalized eigenfrequencies of @xmath42 modes depend strongly on the eos even if the eos do not including the density discontinuity , although the raw frequencies of @xmath42 mode is almost independent . thus , with the help of the observation of stellar properties , it could be possible to make a restriction on the stellar eos .    in this article , for simplicity",
    ", we assume the cowling approximation , which restricts our examination to only stellar oscillations .",
    "this means that we should do a more detailed study including the metric perturbations . via this type of oscillations",
    ", we could obtain the additional information , such as the damping rate of gravitational waves , and combining with results shown in this article would provide more accurate constraints on the stellar properties and/or the stellar eos . furthermore the stellar magnetic field might play an important role .",
    "for example , the quasi - periodic oscillations have observed in the giant flare and these phenomena are believed to be oscillations of strong magnetized neutron stars @xcite .",
    "considering the effects of stellar magnetic fields , it might be possible to obtain the further information .    additionally ,",
    "although we focus only on neutron star matter  ( @xmath43 mev and @xmath44 ) in this article , in order to study the proto neutron stars , we should take into account other effects , e.g. , the thermal effects on the stellar oscillations  @xcite , and the effects of temperature and/or neutrino trapping on the pasta structures  @xcite .",
