    "during the last few decades ultrarelativistic heavy ion collision experiments have claimed substantial attention primarily because they provide us with the opportunity to explore strongly interacting matter at high energy densities where we can expect to find coloured degrees of freedom in a deconfined state known as quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in the initial stages followed by a hot hadronic gas mixture  @xcite .",
    "soon after the collision , this exotic system is believed to approach a state in which the mean value of the macroscopic quantities defining the state of the system becomes considerably larger than their fluctuations .",
    "transport properties have long been employed as probes to understand the characteristics of such a thermodynamic system .",
    "the hydrodynamic evolution of the matter created in relativistic heavy ion collision involves different dissipative processes which can be quantified by the transport coefficients .",
    "in addition to providing relevant insight about the dynamics of the fluid they also carry information about how far the system is away from equilibrium .",
    "recent results from rhic have shown clear indications that the produced matter behaves more as a strongly interacting liquid than a weakly interacting gas .",
    "in fact , the star data on elliptic flow of charged hadrons in au+au collision at @xmath8 gev per nucleon pair could be described ( see e.g.  @xcite ) using very small but finite values of shear viscosity over entropy density ratio @xmath9 in their viscous hydrodynamic code .",
    "a lower bound on the value of @xmath10 which follows from the uncertainty principle and substantiated using ads / cft correspondence  @xcite is consistent with the values of shear viscosity extracted from experimental results  @xcite and from lattice simulations  @xcite .",
    "moreover , considering the qcd to hadron gas transition as a cross over , @xmath9 shows a minimum near @xmath11 , the critical temperature , close to the lower bound mentioned  @xcite , whereas the bulk viscosity to entropy density ratio , @xmath12 shows large values around @xmath11  @xcite .    turning out to be an useful signature of the phase transition occurring in the medium created at rhic and lhc , the estimations of shear ( @xmath13 ) and bulk ( @xmath14 ) viscous coefficients have become a celebrated topic in recent times .",
    "these transport coefficients along with their temperature behavior have been studied both below and above the transition temperature @xmath11 . in  @xcite",
    "the viscosities have been estimated for interacting qcd matter employing the kinetic theory approach . in  @xcite shear viscosity has been obtained by evaluating the correlation functions in the linear response theory .",
    "the bulk viscosity has been investigated in the same spirit using kubo formula near qcd critical point in  @xcite . in  @xcite both",
    "the shear and bulk viscous coefficients have been estimated employing the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model near chiral phase transition .",
    "recent quasiparticle approaches  @xcite and the hydrodynamic simulations in  @xcite have also contributed to the study of the coefficients .    in recent times",
    "a substantial amount of interest has been directed towards the analysis of viscous coefficients in the hadronic sector of heavy ion collisions as well .",
    "the hadron resonance gas model has been effectively applied in order to extract the value of shear viscosity in  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    "the viscosities have been estimated in the kinetic theory approach utilizing parameterized cross sections extracted from empirical data for a hadronic gas mixture , whereas in  @xcite a quasiparticle model has been used to estimate @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the njl model also has been used to predict the viscous coefficient in the hadronic regime by  @xcite using kinetic theory approach .",
    "scattering amplitudes evaluated using lowest order chiral perturbation theory have been employed in  @xcite and a unitarized cross section has been used in  @xcite using the inverse amplitude method to obtain an estimate of @xmath13 . in  @xcite the bulk viscosity of a pion gas has been computed including number - changing inelastic processes using chiral perturbation theory . in  @xcite the behavior of @xmath14 has been demonstrated around the point of phase transition using the linear sigma model .",
    "the scattering cross - section that appears in the collision integral is the dynamical input in the kinetic theory approach and it is highly suggestive that it contains the effect of the hot and/or dense medium . for the case of a pion gas",
    "the consequences of an in - medium cross - section on the temperature dependence of the transport coefficients were extensively discussed in  @xcite . using effective interactions and the techniques of thermal field theory the @xmath0 scattering amplitudes evaluated with self - energy corrected @xmath3 and @xmath4 meson propagators in the internal lines caused a significant modification in the cross - section and consequently the viscosities  @xcite , thermal conductivity  @xcite and relaxation times of flows  @xcite . in view of the upcoming cbm experiment at fair",
    "it is thus natural to ask how the presence of a finite baryon density is likely to affect these results . to study such effects",
    "one has to include nucleons and consequently the @xmath1 cross - section becomes a significant dynamical input in the study of transport phenomena in addition to the @xmath0 cross - section .    in this work",
    "we estimate the shear and bulk viscosities of a hot and dense gas consisting of pions and nucleons .",
    "analogous to the @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons mediating the @xmath0 interaction we consider @xmath1 scattering to proceed by exchange of the lightest baryon resonance , the @xmath15 , which is close to an ideally elastic @xmath1 resonance , decaying almost entirely into pions and nucleons .",
    "we obtain the @xmath15 self - energy at finite temperature and baryon density evaluating several one - loop diagrams with @xmath16 , @xmath3 , @xmath17 and @xmath15 in the internal lines using standard thermal field theoretic methods . the in - medium propagator of the @xmath15 baryon",
    "is then used in the scattering amplitudes to obtain the @xmath1 cross - section .",
    "the transport equations for the pion and nucleon are solved to obtain the temperature and density dependence of the shear and bulk viscosities .",
    "it is worth emphasizing at this point that whereas vacuum scattering amplitudes have been used in almost all works dealing with transport coefficients of hadronic matter discussed above , the novelty in our approach is the use of in - medium ones .",
    "this feature attributes a realistic nature to the evaluation of these quantities and makes the formalism more complete .",
    "moreover , the use of thermal field theoretic methods ensures that scattering and decay of excitations in the medium are included systematically in the evaluation of spectral densities which play the most significant part . incorporating the in - medium @xmath1 cross - section in addition to the @xmath0 in the coupled transport equations for the hadronic gas mixture we thus aim to provide a more reliable estimate of the viscosities , in particular their dependence on temperature and baryon density , which when used as inputs to the hydrodynamic equations will produce a more realistic scenario of space time evolution of the later stages of heavy ion collisions .",
    "this work is organized in the following manner . section ii deals with the formulation of the shear and bulk viscous coefficients obtained by solving the transport equation , where their collision terms are treated in relaxation time approximation .",
    "section iii discusses the in - medium modification of the @xmath5 propagator and its effect on the pion nucleon cross section after briefly recalling the in - medium @xmath0 case .",
    "the numerical results and corresponding discussions are presented in section iv followed by a summary in section v. some mathematical details are provided in appendices a , b and c.",
    "in order to describe the hot and dense matter created in heavy ion collisions we have two lorentz - covariant dynamical frameworks at our disposal ; covariant transport theory and relativistic hydrodynamics . while the evolution of macroscopic parameters related to transport processes involving thermodynamic forces and fluxes can be studied using hydrodynamics , the microscopic collisions between constituents giving rise to dissipative phenomena is described by the transport theory . in linear",

    "the correspondence between kinetic theory and viscous hydrodynamics can thus be established by considering small deviation from equilibrium for which the distribution function is expressed as , f_k(x , p)=f^(0)_k(x , p)+f_k(x , p ) ,  f_k(x , p)=f_k^(0)(x , p)[1f^(0)_k(x , p)]_k(x , p ) [ ff ] where the equilibrium distribution function as a function of position @xmath25 and momentum @xmath26 is given by f_k^(0)(x , p)=^-1 [ f0 ] with @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 representing the local temperature , flow velocity and chemical potential respectively . for bosonic ( fermionic ) degree of freedom @xmath30 . the quantity @xmath31 parametrizes the deviation of the distribution function @xmath32 of the @xmath33 particle specie from equilibrium .",
