    "<S> we present a lagrangian - hamiltonian formalism of a moving dielectric sphere interacting with radiation fields . by including the interaction up to the first order in the speed of the sphere </S>",
    "<S> , we derive the hamiltonian and perform quantization of both the field and the mechanical motion of the sphere . in particular , we show how independent degrees of freedom can be consistently identified under the generalized radiation gauge via instantaneous mode projection . our hamiltonian indicates the form of coupling due to velocity - dependent interactions beyond adiabatic approximation . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the hamiltonian predicts that a geometrical quantum phase can be gained by the sphere moving in a light field . </S>"
