    "methane plays an important role in atmospheric and astrophysical chemistry .",
    "its rotation - vibration spectrum is of key importance for models of the atmospheres of bodies ranging from titan to brown dwarfs .",
    "any temperature - dependent model of the methane spectrum requires comprehensive information on the associated transition intensities .",
    "methane was detected in the exoplanet hd189733b by @xcite and further studied using ground - based observations by @xcite .",
    "however the abundance of exoplanetary methane has sometimes proved controversial @xcite",
    ". on earth methane is an important global warming species @xcite and a biosignature @xcite ; spectra of hot methane are also required for a variety of terrestrial applications including the study of combustion @xcite and sensing @xcite .",
    "methane has been detected on mars @xcite although these observations have not always proved repeatable @xcite . on earth - like planets outside our solar system , whose spectra of course have yet to be observed , methane has long been thought of as a key potential biosignature @xcite .",
    "methane is well known in cool carbon stars and brown dwarfs @xcite ; indeed t - dwarfs are often referred to as methane dwarfs @xcite .",
    "however modelling methane in these objects with available laboratory data has often proved difficult @xcite .",
    "similarly hot methane emissions were observed in aftermath of the collision of comet shoemaker - levy 9 with jupiter @xcite .    given the importance of methane spectra , a growing number of @xmath0ch@xmath6 rotation - vibration line lists are available .",
    "the standard for atmospheric spectroscopy is hitran and the recently released 2012 edition @xcite contains a thorough update for methane as detailed by @xcite .",
    "however , hitran is designed for work at earth atmosphere temperatures and its companion , high - temperature database hitemp @xcite does not include methane .",
    "other sources include a high temperature line list computed by @xcite , the mecasda spectroscopic database containing largely empirical line list @xcite and a partial experimental line list wkmc constructed by @xcite .",
    "finally high - temperature experimental line lists are available due to @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite",
    ". measured methane cross sections are also provided in the pnnl database  @xcite . as discussed below",
    ", none of these compilations are complete at the elevated temperatures considered in this work .",
    "recently we @xcite started the exomol project which aims to generate a comprehensive library of line list for all molecules likely to be important for modelling atmospheres of exoplanets and cool stars . here",
    "we employ the variational program trove @xcite to construct a synthetic line list for @xmath0ch@xmath1  in its ground electronic state . to this end",
    "the schrdingerequation for the rotation - vibration motion of nuclei is solved to obtain eigenvalues ( ro - vibrational energies ) and eigenfunctions ( nuclear motion wavefunctions ) .",
    "the latter are necessary for ro - vibrational averaging of the dipole moment of the molecule and thus to compute the transitional probabilities , usually expressed in terms of the einstein coefficients or line strengths .",
    "such calculations are based on the use of a potential energy surface ( pes ) and dipole moment surfaces ( dmss ) .",
    "there have been many quantum - chemical studies of methane .",
    "we will concentrate on those aimed at producing comprehensive rotation - vibration line lists .",
    "@xcite presented _ ab initio_pes calculations based at the ccsd(t)/cc - pvtz and mp2/cc - pvtz level of theory .",
    "@xcite used rccsd(t)/aug - cc - pvtz theory to compute an hot line list containing 1.4 millions .",
    "@xcite constructed a pes which they showed to provide accurate ( within 1 @xmath4 ) vibrational energies of ch@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite recently presented new _ ab initio _ , methane dmss based on the ccsd(t)/cc - pcvqz level of theory .",
    "@xcite employed these pes and dmss to simulate the room temperature infrared ( ir ) absorption spectrum of ch@xmath1 .",
    "comparison with laboratory experiments showed that their predicted intensities agreed well indicating the high - quality of the underlying _ ab initio _  dmss .",
    "other recent studies on methane include those by @xcite and @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    in this work we present a new ` spectroscopic ' pes obtained by fitting an _ ab initio _",
    "pes from @xcite to the experimental energies of ch@xmath1  with @xmath7",
    ". the _ ab initio _  dipole moment surface ( dms ) of @xcite , obtained at the ccsd(t)/aug - cc - pvtz level of theory ,",
    "is used to compute the line strengths .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "the following section introduces the pes and dmss , as well as the quantum number scheme used to label the ro - vibrational states of ch@xmath1 ( also discussed in detail in the appendix ) .",
    "section [ s : variational ] describes the variational procedure used to solve the schrdinger  equation .",
    "the intensity calculations and the line list generated are detailed in section  [ s : linelist ] .",
    "the evaluation of the new line list and comparisons against different empirical and theoretical line lists are given in section  [ s : analysis ] .",
    "some conclusions are offered in section  [ s : conclusion ] .",
    "in the following ch@xmath1  and methane will refer to the main isotopologue @xmath0ch@xmath1  of methane unless specified .",
    "methane is a symmetric five atomic molecule characterised by nine vibrational degrees of freedom with a vanishing permanent dipole moment .",
    "it is a very high symmetry molecule of the @xmath8(m ) symmetry group containing a number of degenerate modes .",
    "as discussed in our recent work on ammonia @xcite , this situation means that some care has to be taken in selecting an appropriate set of quantum numbers .",
    "below we specify our chosen quantum numbers for ch@xmath1 ; reasons for this choice are given in the appendix .",
    "the symmetry properties of methane spectra have been carefully considered by @xcite and we used this work as our starting point . using the molecular symmetry group @xcite the total ro - vibrational states of ch@xmath1",
    "have total symmetry , @xmath9 , either @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , or @xmath14 .",
    "considering the h nuclear spin , the nuclear statistical weight , @xmath15 , takes the value 5 , 5 , 2 , 3 , and 3 for each symmetry respectively .",
    "the electric dipole transitions obey the following symmetry - determined selection rules : @xmath16 with the standard rotational angular momentum , @xmath17 , selection rules : @xmath18 our set of quantum numbers consists of the following 15 labels : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the symmetries of the rotational and vibrational wavefunction respectively , @xmath22 is the absolute value of the projection of the rotational angular momentum of @xmath23 onto the body - fixed @xmath24 axis , and @xmath25 are the normal mode vibrational quantum numbers ( see the mode designation in table  [ t : irreps ] ) .",
    "we follow @xcite and use the only the absolute values of the vibrational angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 is a multiplicity index used to count states within a given @xmath28 set ( see @xcite ) and indicate the symmetry according to table  [ t : f : m ] .",
    "finally as it is often not possible to uniquely define ch@xmath1quantum numbers , a counting number @xmath29 is also included .",
    "this number runs over states of a given total symmetry and @xmath23 .    .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath30 the actual temperature used by @xcite was @xmath31  k.    experimentally , the spectrum of hot methane has been the subject of several studies , see @xcite ( @xmath32 800 , 1000 , and 1273  k ) , @xcite ( @xmath33  k ) , and @xcite ( @xmath34  k )  @xmath4 . table  [ t : statistics ] summarises the coverage of these studies .",
    "the 10to10 results given in this table suggest that the absorption by methane in each band is essentially independent of temperature ; all previous studies show significantly less absorption by methane at elevated temperatures .",
    "figure  [ f : thievin ] shows the @xmath35  k absorption spectrum of @xcite compared to two types of synthetic ( 10to10 ) absorption spectra of ch@xmath1  at @xmath36  k : ( a ) a ` stick ' spectrum and ( b ) a doppler - broadened spectrum .",
    "the good agreement with the latter spectrum shows the importance of the correct description of the line mixing for accurate reconstruction of the line absorption , absent in the experimental line list by @xcite .",
    "figure  [ f : bernath ] compares the 10to10 absorption ( stick ) spectrum of ch@xmath1  at @xmath37  k with the 1000  k absorption spectrum of @xcite and to the @xmath31  k spectrum of @xcite .",
    "we see that there is generally good agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "however the integrated absorption intensities are very different , see table  [ t : colors ] . in the region 4166.7",
    " 5000.0  @xmath4  ( @xmath38-band ) at @xmath39  k the line list of @xcite gives @xmath40 3.7@xmath41  cm / molecule , compared to our value , 8.2@xmath41  cm / molecule .",
    "hitran  2012 underestimates the opacity at these temperature and region even more , giving @xmath40 1.7@xmath42  cm / molecule . for the higher wavenumber regions ( @xmath43 and @xmath23 ) the problem of missing opacities is even more pronounced from one @xcite to two ( hitran 2012 ) orders of magnitude .",
    "a final piece of experimental information are the `` pnnl '' cross sections provided by @xcite ( @xmath44/molecule ) which are presented at three temperatures , @xmath45=5 , 20 , and 50  c. fig .",

    "pes and dms calculated at the rccsd(t)/aug - cc - pvtz level of theory .",
    "this line list contains 1.4 million lines covering the wavenumbers up to 6200  @xmath4  with @xmath47 and energies up to 6200  @xmath4  only .",
    "we used this line list to generate the cross sections of ch@xmath1  at @xmath48  k assuming doppler broadening only .",
    "[ f : mecasda ] compares these cross sections with those from 10to10 at the same temperature .",
    "the significantly lower values of the cross sections by @xcite indicate that their line list is very incomplete especially for higher frequencies and for hot bands .",
    "the corresponding integrated intensities for the @xmath43 and @xmath38 bands listed in table  [ t : colors ] give a quantitative illustration of this conclusion .",
    "for example , the @xmath43-band integrated intensity at @xmath36  k obtained from the line list of @xcite is @xmath49  @xmath50molecule which is ten time weaker than the 10to10 value .",
    "very recently an accurate synthetic line list mecasda was reported by @xcite .",
    "it was generated using the xtds software @xcite .",
    "this line list contains 5  045  392 transitions of @xmath0ch@xmath1with @xmath51 and covering the wavenumber range up to 6446  @xmath4  with lower state energies up to 6340  @xmath4 , see table  [ t : statistics ] .",
    "the line positions are close to experimental accuracy with a reasonable coverage of ch@xmath1  hot transitions .",
    "figure  [ f : mecasda ] compares the @xmath52  k spectrum generated using mecasda ( below @xmath53  @xmath4 ) and that obtained with 10to10 .",
    "the differences are less pronounced than for hitran or @xcite , however some opacity at high temperature is still missing , see table  [ t : colors ] .",
    "for example , for the @xmath43-band integrated intensity at @xmath52  k mecasda gives @xmath40 2.5@xmath54  cm / molecule , which is 6 times smaller than that of 10to10 . at @xmath36  k",
    "this difference is even more dramatic , 1.3@xmath54 ( mecasda ) compared to 1.5@xmath41  cm / molecule ( 10to10 ) .",
    "methane has been detected in the atmospheres of exoplanets , cool stars and comets .",
    "we have selected two extra - terrestrial methane spectra recorded at elevated temperatures at relatively high or medium resolution .",
    "the several collisions of comet shoemaker - levy 9 with jupiter was carefully observed in the infrared @xcite . fig .",
    "[ f : comet ] compares a synthetic 10to10 emission spectrum of methane at @xmath55  k with one of the jovian spectra recorded during the impact of comet shoemaker - levy 9 on 17 july 1994 @xcite .",
    "@xcite identified a number of hot methane features based on the high resolution spectrum of @xcite .",
    "our other example is associated with the spectroscopy of the methane brown dwarfs .",
    "[ f : dwarf ] gives a comparison of a synthetic 10to10 absorption spectrum of ch@xmath1at @xmath56  k with the spectrum of the t4.5 brown dwarf 2mass j0559 - 1404 centered at 1.67  @xmath2 m reported by @xcite , who characterised the methane spectral features based on the high resolution ch@xmath1spectrum by @xcite . in both cases our spectra agree well with the observation and can potentially offer a more complete picture of the methane contributions to the spectral description of cool stars and exoplanets .",
    "we have computed a methane vibration - rotation line list containing almost 10 billion transitions which we call 10to10 .",
    "the full line list for each of these isotopologues can be downloaded from the cds , via ftp://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/cats/j/mnras/ or http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?j/mnras/ , and from the exomol website www.exomol.com .",
    "the problem with having such an extensive line list is that files are large and difficult to manipulate .",
    "the exomol project provides facilities for generating cross sections at appropriate temperatures @xcite .",
    "10to10 has been constructed as the next member in the series of line lists provided by the exomol project @xcite which aims to provide comprehensive line lists for studies of hot atmospheres such as exoplanet , brown dwarfs and cool stars .",
    "it construction means that there are now hot line lists for the key set of molecules methane , water @xcite and ammonia @xcite .",
    "these provide a suitable set of spectroscopic data on hot molecules for systematic models to be performed on astronomical objects with hot , molecular hydrogen - rich atmospheres .",
    "work in this direction has already started .",
    "however , despite the size of the 10to10 line list it remains incomplete and should only be used with caution for temperatures higher than 1500 k as it will miss a significant proportion of the opacity at these higher temperatures .",
    "furthermore , the effective , empirical character of the underlying potential energy surface and the convergence deficiency of the trove nuclear motion calculations means that the accuracy of the energy levels , particularly at higher energies , and hence the related transition frequencies could be improved .",
    "work in this direction will be undertaken in due course .",

    "methane is a symmetric five atomic molecule characterised by nine vibrational degrees of freedom with a vanishing permanent dipole moment .",
    "it is a very high symmetry molecule of the @xmath8(m ) symmetry group . in this work",
    "we use the molecular symmetry group @xcite to describe the irreducible representations ( irreps ) of ch@xmath1 .",
    "thus the ro - vibrational states of ch@xmath1  will be assigned with the five irreps , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are one - dimensional ( 1d ) , @xmath12 is a 2d , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are 3d irreps .",
    "because of the @xmath58 nuclear spins of the hydrogens , the total spin - rotation - vibration states of @xmath0ch@xmath1  is fermionic and degenerate if hyperfine splittings are neglected .",
    "this degeneracy gives rise to nuclear statistical weight factors of 5 , 5 , 2 , 3 , and 3 for @xmath59 = @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , respectively . the symmetry @xmath59 is a ` good quantum number ' @xcite as well as the rotational angular momentum quantum number @xmath23 , which are two main labels used to classify the ro - vibrational states of ch@xmath1 .",
    "the electric dipole selection rules are given in eqs .",
    "( [ e : selection - rules ] ) and ( [ e : selection - rules : j ] ) . the dipole moment components of the molecule in the body - fixed frame span the three components of the @xmath60 irrep , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath62 and the potential energy function is fully symmetric ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "apart from these well - defined , good quantum numbers , like @xmath23 and symmetry , it is a common practise in spectroscopy to assign the ro - vibrational states of a molecule using a full set of rotational and vibrational labels which aid characterizing the state in question .",
    "these quantum numbers are usually associated with some selected referenced ro - vibrational functions and are used to describe the similarity of the given ro - vibrational eigenfunction to these reference functions . in variational approaches , where the eigenfunction is given as an linear expansion in terms of the basis functions , the similarity can be assessed by identifying the largest contribution to such an expansion ( see , for example @xcite ) . in this case",
    "the basis functions play the role of the reference functions and the labels characterising the corresponding basis functions are used as the approximate quantum numbers for the eigenstate .",
    "the standard problem with this , and other approaches , is the strong mixing of basis set functions at high excitations which gives rise to the ambiguity in assignment .",
    "alternatively , the similarity can be established by computing overlaps between the target and reference wavefunctions , see , for example @xcite , where the reference functions can be any functions and are not limited by the choice of the basis set .",
    "the conventional choice of the reference functions includes the rigid - rotor functions for the rotation and the normal mode ( degenerate ) harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions .",
    "even the latter approach suffers from the state mixing problem and thus can not guarantee unambiguous definition of the quantum numbers .",
    "the difficulty of assigning the methane energy levels is well recognized .",
    "@xcite suggested the following quantum numbers for the vibrational assignment : @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , @xmath67 , where @xmath63 is the vibrational quantum number , @xmath64 is the vibrational angular momentum ( @xmath68 or @xmath69 for @xmath70 ) , @xmath66 is a @xmath8  irrep and @xmath65 is multiplicity index for a given set @xmath71 .",
    "we partly follow this scheme .",
    "we use the largest contribution approach to assign the eigenfunction of methane .",
    "our selection of the quantum numbers for ch@xmath1  is given in eq .  .",
    "for the rotation basis , symmetrized rigid - rotor functions @xmath72 are used , where @xmath73 , @xmath74 is the projection of @xmath17 on the body - fixed @xmath24-axis , and @xmath20 is the rotational symmetry . for the vibrations we use nine 1d local ( non - normal ) mode basis functions @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) ( see text ) which give rise to nine local mode vibrational quantum numbers @xmath77 . in order to provide the conventional normal mode quantum numbers , our local mode",
    "quantum numbers are mapped to their normal mode counterparts by comparing the corresponding symmetry and polyad of basis functions with that of the reference ( degenerate ) harmonic oscillator functions .",
    "the normal mode quantum numbers are @xmath78 .",
    "the classification of the normal modes under @xmath8symmetry is given in table  [ t : irreps ] .",
    "the quantum numbers @xmath79 associated with an isotropic 2d harmonic oscillator @xmath80 ( @xmath12 symmetry ) is complemented with the projection of the vibrational angular momentum @xmath81 @xcite . since the definition of the sign of @xmath82 is ambiguous ( as ambiguous the sign of @xmath74 )",
    ", we follow the suggestion of @xcite and use the absolute value @xmath83 ( 1 ) instead .",
    "similarly , the classification of the 3d normal modes 3 and 4 is based on the 3d isotropic harmonic oscillator @xmath84 @xcite ( @xmath67 ) , where @xmath63 is the vibrational quantum number and @xmath64 is the vibrational angular momentum . following the classification by @xcite we add the multiplicity index @xmath27 which we associate with the symmetry according with table  [ t : f : m ] , where @xmath85 is odd for @xmath86 and @xmath14 and even for @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "imposing the condition @xmath87 automatically constrains @xmath88 as @xmath10 , @xmath89 as @xmath14 , @xmath90 as @xmath91 , and @xmath92 as @xmath14 . for higher values of @xmath85",
    "these symmetry designations are repeated as shown in table  [ t : f : m ] .",
    "we also choose @xmath93 for @xmath11 and @xmath94 for @xmath10 .",
    "it should be noted however that for @xmath10 and @xmath11 these variations of @xmath85 and @xmath95 produce over - sampled sets and we choose the combinations with smallest @xmath85 .",
    "finally , we stress that our stretching vibrational basis set is not based on the harmonic oscillator functions .",
    "we use harmonic oscillators only as a reference to correlate the local mode quantum numbers with the conventional normal mode ones ."
