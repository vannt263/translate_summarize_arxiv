    "the study of the metallic hydrogen s properties has been lasting for over seventy years . in 1935 ,",
    "wigner and huntington for the first time suggested , that under the influence of high pressure ( @xmath10 ) the hydrogen should transform into the molecular metallic phase [ 1 ] .",
    "the later theoretical results set the metallization of hydrogen in the pressures range from @xmath11 gpa to @xmath12 gpa @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning , that the understanding of the high - pressure properties of hydrogen seems to be substantial due to the fact , that this element in the metallic state ( both molecular and atomic ) is appearing inside the planets of the jovian type @xcite .",
    "the next step was made by ashcroft who suggested , that the metallic hydrogen could be potential high - temperature superconductor @xcite . since that moment ,",
    "the constant interest in the properties of the hydrogen s superconducting state has been dated . in particular ,",
    "the numerical results predict that in the range of the `` lower '' pressures ( up to @xmath13 gpa ) the critical temperature ( @xmath14 ) is of the order ( @xmath15-@xmath11 ) k @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . for the extremely high pressure ( @xmath16 gpa ) the superconducting state in the atomic metallic hydrogen has been studied in the papers @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the critical temperature decreases from @xmath17 k to @xmath18 k for @xmath19 , where @xmath20 denotes the critical value of the coulomb pseudopotential . in the considered case",
    "the other thermodynamic parameters diverge from the bcs values @xcite e.g. : the dimensionless ratio @xmath21 is changing from @xmath22 to @xmath23 together with the coulomb pseudopotential s growth , whereas the minimum value of @xmath24 is equal to @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the symbols defining the ratios @xmath26 and @xmath27 have following meaning : @xmath28 denotes the specific heat difference between the superconducting and normal state at the critical temperature , @xmath29 represents the specific heat of the normal state , while @xmath30 is the value of the thermodynamic critical field at the temperature of zero kelvin .    in the literature the specific heat and the thermodynamic critical field",
    "were not determined for the molecular metallic hydrogen . due to the large values of the electron - phonon constant ( @xmath31_{p_{1}}=0.93 $ ] and @xmath31_{p_{2}}=1.2 $ ] ) it has to be presumed , that above quantities should be calculated in the framework of the eliashberg formalism @xcite . in the paper , we take into consideration the following values of the pressure : @xmath0 gpa and @xmath1 gpa . in this case",
    "the molecular metallic hydrogen crystallizes in the _ cmca _ structure @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the bcs theory is based on the hamiltonian , which models the pairing interaction in the simplest effective way .",
    "we notice that the bcs hamiltonian can be derived from the more realistic frhlich s operator ( @xmath32 ) , which describes the electron - phonon coupling in the open form @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the eliashberg equations are derived directly from @xmath32 with an use of the thermodynamic green functions @xcite . as a result",
    "one can obtain @xcite :    @xmath33    and @xmath34                                    \\frac{\\phi_{m } }                                    { \\sqrt{\\omega_m^2z^{2}_{m}+\\phi^{2}_{m}}}.\\ ] ]    the solutions of the eliashberg equations are two functions defined on the imaginary axis : the wave function renormalization factor ( @xmath35 ) and the order parameter function ( @xmath36 ) ; @xmath37 is the @xmath38-th matsubara frequency , where @xmath39 ( @xmath40 denotes the boltzmann constant ) . in the framework of the eliashberg formalism",
    "the order parameter is defined as : @xmath41 .",
    "the symbol @xmath42 represents the pairing kernel : @xmath43 the eliashberg functions for the pressures @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) were determined in the paper @xcite .",
    "the symbol @xmath47 denotes the maximum phonon frequency , where @xmath48_{p_{1}}=477 $ ] mev and @xmath48_{p2}=508 $ ] mev .",
    "the depairing correlations , appearing between electrons , are modeled with the help of the coulomb pseudopotential @xmath20 ; the symbol @xmath49 denotes the heaviside unit function and @xmath50 is the cut - off frequency ( @xmath51 ) . in the paper",
    "we have assumed low value of the coulomb pseudopotential for both considered pressures ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the assumption above can be justified by referring to the bennemann - garland formula @xcite : @xmath53 $ ] , where the symbol @xmath54 indicates the value of the electronic density of states at the fermi energy . in particular , we have : @xmath55 states / ry / spin for @xmath44 and @xmath56 states / ry / spin for @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath57_{p1}$ ] and @xmath57_{p2}$ ] amounts @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively .    from the mathematical point of view",
    "the eliashberg set is composed of the strongly non - linear algebraic equations with the integral kernel @xmath42 . in order to achieve stable solutions",
    "one needs to take into account adequately large number of the equations . in the paper we have assumed @xmath60 , what assured stability of the solutions beginning from the temperature of @xmath61 k ( @xmath62 mev )",
    "the eliashberg equations were solved by using the iterative method presented in the papers @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the solutions of the eliashberg equations for the selected temperatures have been presented in figs . and .",
    "it can be easily noticed , that the functions @xmath63 and @xmath64 decrease together with the matsubara frequencies growth .",
    "however , @xmath63 saturates considerably slower than @xmath64 .",
    "the applied pressure significantly influences on the values of wave function renormalization factor and the order parameter . from the physical point of view the above fact",
    "means , that together with the increasing of @xmath10 increases the electron effective mass ( @xmath65 ) and the value of critical temperature ( @xmath66_{p_{1}}=108.2 $ ] k , @xmath66_{p_{2}}=162.7 $ ] k ) .    analyzing the dependence of @xmath63 and @xmath64 on temperature it has been stated , that the solutions of the eliashberg equations very unlikely evolve with @xmath67 . in fig .",
    "we have plotted the functions @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the presented results show , that the wave function renormalization factor is weakly dependent on the temperature and takes its maximum for @xmath70 .",
    "in contrast , the temperature dependence of the order parameter is strong and can be modeled by using the formula : @xmath71 , where : @xmath72_{p_{1}}=18.15 $ ] mev , @xmath72_{p_{2}}=29.12 $ ] mev , @xmath73_{p_{1}}=3.58 $ ] and @xmath73_{p_{2}}=3.61 $ ] .    , the figure ( b ) for @xmath45 . ]    , the figure ( b ) for @xmath45 . ]     and @xmath45 are presented . ]",
    "the thermodynamic properties of the molecular metallic hydrogen can be explicitly determined on the basis of the free energy difference between the superconducting and normal state ( @xmath74 ) @xcite : @xmath75 where the functions @xmath76 and @xmath77 denote the wave function renormalization factors for the superconducting ( s ) and normal ( n ) state respectively .    in the first step , on the basis of eq . , we have calculated the specific heat difference between the superconducting and normal state @xmath78 : @xmath79 } { d\\left(k_{b}t\\right)^{2}}.\\ ] ] next , the specific heat in the normal state has been calculated with an use of the formula : @xmath80 where @xmath81 . in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] we have plotted the temperature dependence of the specific heat for the superconducting and normal state . assuming previously given values of the electronic density of states it can be shown , that together with the growth of @xmath10 the specific heat s jump at the critical temperature very strongly increases . in particular , we have : @xmath2_{p_{2}}/\\left[\\delta c\\left(t_{c}\\right)\\right]_{p_{1}}\\simeq 2.33 $ ] .    , the figure ( b ) for @xmath45 .",
    "the vertical line indicates a position of the specific heat jump that occurs at @xmath14 . ]",
    "below , we have calculated the values of the thermodynamic critical field ( cgs units ) : @xmath82}.\\ ] ] in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] we have presented the dependence of @xmath83 on the temperature . on the basis of obtained results we can see , that the value of the thermodynamic critical field near the temperature of zero kelvin ( @xmath84 ) also strongly increases with the pressure : @xmath3_{p_{2}}/\\left[h_{c}\\left(0\\right)\\right]_{p_{1}}\\simeq 1.74 $ ] .    ,",
    "the figure ( b ) for @xmath45 . ]    on the basis of determined thermodynamic functions one can calculate two fundamental ratios : @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "let us notice , that in the framework of bcs model these quantities have the universal values ( @xmath85_{\\rm bcs}=1.43 $ ] and @xmath86_{\\rm bcs}=0.168 $ ] ) @xcite .",
    "for the molecular metallic hydrogen following results were obtained : @xmath87_{p_{1}}=1.91,\\qquad \\left[r_{1}\\right]_{p_{2}}=2.39\\ ] ] and @xmath88_{p_{1}}=0.152,\\qquad \\left[r_{2}\\right]_{p_{2}}=0.140.\\ ] ]    it is easy to notice that the calculated ratios significantly diverge from the values predicted by the bcs theory .",
    "additionally it should be underlined , that @xmath26 is increasing together with the pressure s growth , whereas the ratio @xmath27 is decreasing .",
    "in the paper the free energy difference between the superconducting and normal state for the molecular metallic hydrogen was calculated .",
    "the pressure values @xmath0 gpa and @xmath1 gpa were taken into consideration .",
    "on the basis of achieved results it has been shown , that the specific heat s jump at the critical temperature and the thermodynamic critical field near the temperature of zero kelvin strongly increase together with the pressure s growth ( @xmath2_{p2}/\\left[\\delta c\\left(t_{c}\\right)\\right]_{p1}\\simeq 2.33 $ ] and @xmath3_{p2}/\\left[h_{c}\\left(0\\right)\\right]_{p1}\\simeq 1.74 $ ] ) .",
    "the obtained thermodynamic quantities enable the determination of the fundamental ratios : @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
