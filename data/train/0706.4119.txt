    "in a very recent article @xcite we have shown that several hadronic three - body decays of @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons can be well described , up to moderately high energies , in a model for production processes derived from the so - called resonance - spectrum expansion ( rse ) @xcite .",
    "the rse formalism amounts to an effective description of non - exotic meson - meson scattering , based upon quark - antiquark pair creation and annihilation allowing transitions between an infinity of confined @xmath5 states and the meson - meson continuum .",
    "an essential feature of the rse is that it gives rise to closed - form expressions for the @xmath6-matrix and even the fully off - shell @xmath7-matrix .",
    "hence , exact analyticity and unitarity properties , as well as a correct ( sub)threshold behaviour , are manifestly satisfied .",
    "moreover , the resulting meson - meson production amplitude can be derived exactly , too , by summing the corresponding two - body born series , the only assumption being that the third particle acts as a mere spectator @xcite .    in the present paper , we shall further develop the formalism introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , so as to cover the most general multichannel case in mesonic 3-body decays .",
    "clearly , at higher energies competing inelastic 2-meson channels require that the production amplitude be described by a vector and not a scalar function .",
    "the underlying 2-body scattering @xmath7-matrix is then a true matrix .",
    "furthermore , also the quark - antiquark sector needs an extension , as there can be mixing of different @xmath5 channels that couple to the same meson - meson channels .",
    "this is the case in e.g.  the production of @xmath8 @xmath9 and @xmath10 pairs , which both couple to the @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) and @xmath13 channels , giving rise to the isoscalar scalar resonances @xmath14 ( alias @xmath15 ) and @xmath16 .",
    "finally , having a general and exact  within the model assumptions  expression for production amplitudes at hand , we may carry out a detailed comparison with the ansatzes employed in other approaches , focusing on common features as well as clear differences .    under the spectator approximation",
    ", we assume that a pair of mesons is created out of one @xmath5 pair emerging from the original decay , accompanied by a non - interacting spectator meson . in this process",
    ", we only consider ozi - allowed @xcite strong transitions to pairs of mesons .",
    "the intensities of transitions between the initial @xmath5 pair ( its quantum numbers , including flavour , are abbreviated by @xmath17 ) and the various meson - meson pairs @xmath18 allowed by quantum numbers are given by coupling constants @xmath19 determined via the recoupling scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite . in sec .",
    "[ secttmatrix ] , we derive the matrix elements @xmath20 of the scattering amplitude at total cm energy @xmath21 , for transitions between the meson - meson channels @xmath18 and @xmath22 . in the same section , we establish a relation between the common denominator @xmath23 of all matrix elements @xmath24 and the numerators of diagonal matrix elements of @xmath25 , the latter representing elastic scattering . the production amplitude @xmath26 , which is related to the probability of producing a meson - meson pair @xmath18 , assuming that a @xmath5 pair emerges in the initial  here not described ",
    "stages of the decay process , is determined in sec .",
    "[ productionmatrix ] .",
    "note that the process giving rise to the initial @xmath5 pair plus the spectator meson can be either weak or strong yet ozi - suppressed ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for some examples ) .",
    "the central result of the present paper is a relation between the production and scattering amplitudes which can be formulated as @xmath27 where the @xmath28 stand for momentum distributions that will be specified in sec .",
    "[ productionmatrix ] ( eq .  [ prodall ] ) .",
    "we thus obtain the result that the production amplitude is in the first place given by the common denominator of the scattering amplitudes .",
    "this implies that , within the rse formalism , resonance poles are identical for production and scattering , at least in the spectator approximation .",
    "secondly , we find that the remainder of the production amplitude to the @xmath18-th two - meson channel is proportional to the sum of the differences between all possible elastic scattering amplitudes @xmath29 and the inelastic amplitudes for the @xmath18-th channel , @xmath20",
    ". this does not spoil our conclusion about the resonance poles , since all @xmath7-matrix elements share the _ common _ denominator .",
    "note , however , that the contribution of the term @xmath30 vanishes in the expression between braces on the r.h.s .",
    "( [ centralresult ] ) .",
    "consequently , the amplitude @xmath26 for the production of a two - meson pair @xmath18 does not carry any dependence on the amplitude for elastic scattering @xmath31 . in those cases where the coupling to different meson - meson channels vanishes or can be neglected , implying a @xmath32 @xmath7-matrix , the resulting production amplitude is solely determined by the common denominator @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "some words are due about the @xmath33-matrix formalism . in general , and so also here",
    ", the @xmath7-matrix can be written as @xmath34 , where @xmath33 is a real symmetric matrix .",
    "so , at first sight , it seems that the common denominator of all @xmath7-matrix elements is given by @xmath35 .",
    "however , this is not the case .",
    "first of all , @xmath33 is a matrix and not just a real function . but even in the @xmath36 case , where @xmath33 can be represented by a real function , it has a denominator itself , the zeros of which are the @xmath33-matrix poles , located at the real energies where some eigenphase shift passes through @xmath37 .",
    "the common denominator above is then the sum of the denominator of @xmath33 plus @xmath38 times the numerator of @xmath33 .",
    "in general , when @xmath33 is a matrix , this relation involves the determinant of @xmath33 . hence , comparing @xmath33-matrix poles , lying on the real axis in the complex energy plane , and resonance poles , which are usually in the _ second _ riemann sheet with respect to the nearest `` open '' threshold , is far from trivial .",
    "moreover , for some resonances , like the @xmath15 and the @xmath39 ( @xmath40 @xcite ) , the respective @xmath33-matrix poles , corresponding to an elastic phase shift @xmath41 , lie about 350600 mev higher in energy that the real parts of the respective @xmath6-matrix poles , while mixing with other resonances ( @xmath16 and @xmath42 ) further complicates the picture .",
    "so rather than making _ ad hoc _ assumptions about poles of the production amplitude , we shall straightforwardly derive the latter , and then see what its properties are . _ _",
    "a final remark here concerns watson s @xcite theorem for production .",
    "this theorem implicitly relies on having a potential which is energy independent or only weakly energy dependent .",
    "however , this is not the case here , because the energy dependence of our effective meson - meson potential is far stronger than that of the scattering @xmath7-matrix . as a consequence",
    ", the energy dependence of the production experiment does not resemble at all the one of the @xmath7-matrix , and all exercises imposing the watson `` theorem '' or theorems derived from it are inappropriate here .",
    "this issue is analysed in more detail in ref .",
    "scattering from a weakly coupled resonant source has been studied in a variety of different approaches . for such systems",
    "it is observed that resonances occur at energies that are close to the unperturbed spectrum of the resonant source .",
    "widths and mass shifts can be determined by perturbative methods , and expressed in terms of pole positions of the resonances in the complex energy plane .",
    "intuitively , however , perturbative methods do not offer the correct strategy for strong interactions . since in the present paper",
    "we are interested in obtaining exact relations between scattering and production amplitudes , which are moreover based on a microscopic description in terms of quarks , we rather fall back upon an approximate yet exactly solvable theory or model .",
    "such a manifestly unitary and analytic framework is provided by the rse .",
    "the rse aims at describing the scattering of meson pairs in non - exotic channels , thereby assuming that in the interaction region a meson pair may temporarely transform into a quark - antiquark pair through @xmath5 annihilation and subsequent creation .",
    "the transitions of the system , from meson - meson pairs to @xmath5 pairs and vice - versa , are described by an off - diagonal potential @xmath43 in the rse , linking these two sectors to each other .",
    "it has a maximum at an interquark distance @xmath44 which depends on the average effective quark mass and runs from slightly less than 0.2 fm for @xmath45 to about 0.6 fm for light quarks .",
    "furthermore , we assume that this mechanism gives rise to the dominant meson - meson interaction in non - exotic channels . here , we limit ourselves to the case where @xmath43 is considered the only interaction .",
    "the intermediate @xmath5 states are supposed to have an unperturbed confinement spectrum depending on the quantum numbers of the system .",
    "its energy eigenvalues are all contained in the two - meson scattering matrix , which , consequently , develops corresponding cdd resonance poles .",
    "an addtional nice feature of the rse , which will turn out to be crucial for the construction of the production amplitude , is the possibility to obtain the closed - form scattering @xmath7-matrix both in configuration and in momentum space . in the former representation , coupled - channel schrdinger equations with the proper boundary conditions",
    "directly lead to the full solution , while in the latter picture individual born terms can be explicitly calculated and then exactly summed up owing to the general separable nature of the effective meson - meson potential , with no need to solve the lippmann - schwinger @xcite integral equations .",
    "this allows to verify the correctness of the momentum - space approach in the scattering case , which is the only method at our disposal to describe production .",
    "as we shall see below , a similar born series can then be written down and summed up .",
    "the building blocks of the rse meson - meson scattering amplitude are the effective meson - meson potentials and the free two - meson propagators , which are graphically represented in fig .",
    "[ loops ] .",
    "it is the philosophy of the rse that confinement and decay can be separated .",
    "hence , in the interaction region , a two - meson system can appear as a permanently confined system consisting of a valence quark and a valence antiquark .",
    "possible intermediate crypto - exotic multiquark states are not considered in the rse .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the dynamics of the intermediate @xmath5 states",
    "is described by a permanently confining hamiltonian @xmath46 , which has a complete set of eigenstates at eigenvalues representing the confinement spectrum .",
    "the other part of the strong interactions , generating transitions between a two - meson system and a @xmath5 state , is given by a transition potential @xmath43 .",
    "consequently , the effective meson - meson interaction in fig .  [ loops ] is described by the operator @xmath47^{-1}\\ ; v_{t } \\;\\;\\ ; , \\label{quarkloop}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the total invariant mass of the coupled - channel system . these interactions and the free two - meson propagators ,",
    "both depicted in fig .",
    "[ loops ] , can then be used in an ordinary lippmann - schwinger @xcite approach to scattering .",
    "nevertheless , in constructing the born series , quark - loop contributions to all orders are automatically accounted for , as becomes clear from fig .",
    "[ thetmatrix ] .",

    "@xcite it was shown how , under the rse assumptions , the integrations can be done analytically . for the present discussion , it is only necessary to mention the generic form of the rse expression , given by @xmath50 the overall coupling @xmath51 and the interaction radius @xmath44 represent the total probability of quark - pair creation / annihilation and the average interquark distance at which such processes take place , respectively ; @xmath52 stands for the spherical bessel function for the relative meson - meson angular momentum @xmath53 ; @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the relative linear momenta in the two - meson channels @xmath18 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "the matrix @xmath57 is a real and symmetric function of the total invariant mass of the system .",
    "the intermediate @xmath5 systems may have different orbital angular momenta , for the same quantum numbers .",
    "for example , a meson - meson system with @xmath58 couples to @xmath5 systems in either an @xmath6 or a @xmath3 wave . on the other hand , isosinglet mesons can be mixtures of different quark flavours , usually @xmath11 and @xmath13 .",
    "in such cases , more than one type of @xmath5 states are involved in the quark loops of the process depicted in fig .",
    "[ thetmatrix ] .",
    "however , since the recurrencies of the permanently confined @xmath5 systems are automatically included by the definition of the born term ( [ bornterm ] ) , the number of @xmath5 channels that couple to a specific set of two - meson quantum numbers is limited , usually to one or two .",
    "nevertheless , the number of two - meson scattering channels is in principle not restricted .    for any number of coupled confinement and scattering channels , the general structure of the amplitude reads ( @xmath59 ) @xmath60 & & = \\ , { \\frac{\\textstyle \\dlambda^{2}}{\\textstyle 4\\pi^{2}}}\\ , \\sum_{\\ell = 0}^{\\infty}(2\\ell + 1)\\ , p_{\\ell}\\left(\\hat{p}_{i}\\cdot\\hat{p}_{j}\\,\\right)\\ , j_{\\ell}\\left ( p_{i}r_{0}\\right)\\ , j_{\\ell}\\left ( p_{j}r_{0}\\right)\\ ; { \\frac{\\textstyle { \\cal a\\,}^{(\\ell ) } _ { ij}(e)}{\\textstyle { \\cal d\\,}^{(\\ell)}(e ) } } \\;\\;\\ ; , \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are functions of the total invariant mass @xmath48 satisfying the unitarity condition @xmath63    the denominator @xmath62 contains the full pole structure of the coupled two - meson states . in order to be a bit more specific ,",
    "let us consider the scattering of charmed mesons , i.e. , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , all coupled to @xmath70 .",
    "for such a process , @xmath62 has in the rse the form @xmath71 where the outer sum runs over all two - meson channels , and the inner sum over all recurrencies @xmath72 for the operator @xmath46 describing confinement in the @xmath70 system . @xmath73 and @xmath74 represent the eigenstate and eigenvalue of the @xmath72-th recurrency of the @xmath46 spectrum , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath75 stand for the relative couplings of each of the two - meson systems to @xmath70 , while @xmath76 is a spherical hankel function of the first kind .",
    "the denominator @xmath77 vanishes for @xmath48 near @xmath74 and small overall coupling @xmath51 . in this case",
    ", the scattering cross sections in all channels display narrow spikes for values of @xmath48 in the vicinity of @xmath74 ( @xmath78 , 1 , 2 , @xmath79 ) .",
    "hence , for small @xmath51 , the theoretical cross sections reproduce  up to small shifts  the hypothetical @xmath70 confinement spectrum .    however , for larger values of @xmath51 the zeros in @xmath62 are no longer near the eigenvalues of @xmath46 , but move deeper into the complex @xmath48 plane , farther away from the real axis and with appreciable shifts for the real parts as well",
    ". then , the resonance spectrum does no longer reproduce the spectrum of @xmath46 : resonances start overlapping and even the number of zeros in @xmath62 that lie close enough to the real energy axis to be observed experimentally may change .",
    "we believe this describes quite accurately the true situation in hadron spectroscopy .    below the lowest threshold , poles , i.e. , zeros in @xmath62 ( eq .  [ ccbardd ] ) , come out on the real axis , because the expression @xmath80 turns real . in that case , expression  ( [ tmatrix ] ) describes bound @xmath70 states , such as @xmath81 , @xmath2 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , yet with an admixture of two - meson components .",
    "the energy eigenvalues of these `` dressed '' states then depend on the value of @xmath51 .",
    "it has been observed @xcite that charmonium mass shifts with respect to the pure confinement spectrum can be surprisingly large in the rse , as well as in other approaches @xcite .    in the present work ,",

    "nothing simpel follows . moreover , the pole positions for both scattering and production stem from @xmath62 , and not from @xmath33 .",
    "hence , the excercise to express the production amplitude in terms of the @xmath33-matrix seems pointless .",
    "the two - meson production amplitude  ( [ prodall ] ) has been rigorously calculated , to all orders , from a relatively general expression for a two - meson scattering amplitude ( eq .  ( [ tmatrix ] ) ) dominated by @xmath138-channel resonances .",

'' in the context of duality , harari @xcite formulated a necessary condition for an @xmath138-channel description to reproduce certain @xmath139-channel effects , namely the existence of `` strong correlations between the different @xmath138-channel resonances .

    "well , this is exactly what our infinite rse sum over confinement states guarantees .",
    "further proof showing the rse model to be realistic is its correct threshold behaviour in elastic @xmath9 scattering @xcite .",
    "another possible critique of our method could be its nr nature .",
    "nevertheless , in practical phenomenological applications to spectroscopy and elastic scattering , relative momenta and reduced masses in the two - meson channels have been consistently defined in a relativistic way , thus ensuring proper kinematics at much higher energies than the underlying nr formalism seems to support .",
    "such a minimal treatment of relativity is indeed common practice in many relativised quark models .",
    "our successful description of the spectroscopy and scattering properties of the light scalar mesons @xcite provides additional evidence that this approach to relativity is reasonable .",
    "this is also supported by our very recent first application of the present production formalism in the single - channel case @xcite .",
    "it thus seems fair to conclude that production amplitudes can in general contain terms which are not proportional to scattering @xmath7-matrix elements and , moreover , that the proportionality coefficients are complex .",
