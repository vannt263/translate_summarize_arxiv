    "it is observed that the sunspot s activity is organized in time and latitude and forms the large scales patterns which are called the maunder butterfly diagram .",
    "this pattern is believed to be produced by the large - scale toroidal magnetic field generated in the convection zone .",
    "another component of the solar activity is represented by the global poloidal magnetic field extending outside the sun and shaping the solar corona .",
    "both components synchronously evolve as the solar 11-year cycle progresses .",
    "the global poloidal field reverses the sign in the polar regions near the time of maximum of sunspot activity .",
    "a remarkable feature of cyclic solar activity is that it is far to be just a cycle .",
    "cycle amplitude and shape varies from one cycle to the other and prognostic abilities of any study of solar activity looks as its very attractive destination .",
    "solar activity observations give various hints that various tracers of solar activity which are exploited to quantify the phenomenon demonstrate some relation one to the other what opens a possibility to predict future evolution of solar activity basing on available observations of other indices .",
    "waldmeier @xcite pointed out at first this option ( an inverse correlation between the length of the ascending phase of a cycle , or its rise time , and the peak sunspot number of that cycle ) and applied it , @xcite , to give a prediction for the following cycle .",
    "the latter paper is in practice the first accessible ( at least for german speaking readers ) paper in the area .",
    "later other relation of this this type was suggested and summarized as waldmeier relations .",
    "this development was clearly summarized by @xcite and recently by @xcite .",
    "the nature of the physical processes , that are manifested in the waldmeier relations , is not clear , see discussion , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "it seems to be remarkable , however , that these statistical properties of magnetic activity are also existed for the other tracers related with the sunspot activity ( e.g. , sunspot group and squares of sunspot groups , see @xcite ) , and even for the other kind of the solar and stellar activity indices , e.g. , for the ca ii index @xcite .",
    "the waldmeier relations are considered as a valuable test of the dynamo models @xcite .    a natural way to push",
    "the understanding of the problem forward is to clarify the physics underlying waldmeier relations .",
    "it is more or less accepted that cyclic solar activity is driven by a dynamo , i.e. a mechanism which transforms kinetic energy of hydrodynamical motions into magnetic one .",
    "most of the current solar dynamo models suggest that the toroidal magnetic field that emerges on the surface and forms sunspots is generated near the bottom of the convection zone , in the tachocline or just beneath it in a convection overshoot layer ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this kind of dynamo can be approximated by the parker s surface dynamo waves @xcite .",
    "the direction of the dynamo waves propagation is defined by the parker - yoshimura rule @xcite .",
    "it states that for the @xmath1 kind dynamo the waves propagates along iso - surfaces of the angular velocity .",
    "the propagation process can be modified by the turbulent transport ( associated with the mean drift of magnetic activity in the turbulent media by means turbulent mechanisms ) , by the anisotropic turbulent diffusivity ( see , @xcite ) , and by meridional circulation @xcite . a viewpoint , which is an alternative to the parker s surface dynamo waves is presented by the distributed dynamo with subsurface shear , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the dynamo waves here propagates along the radius in the main part of the solar convection zone , @xcite .",
    "the near surface activity is shaped by the subsurface shear .",
    "one more option is the flux - transport dynamo , e.g. @xcite .    in the context of dynamo theory , the waldmeier relations have to be explained by some mechanism which varies amplitude and shape of activity cycle and fluctuations",
    "@xmath0-effect are considered below as such mechanism .",
    "this idea extend the approach proposed in @xcite to explain these relations by changing the magnitude of the @xmath0-effect .",
    "the physical idea underlying this mechanism can be presented as follows .",
    "@xmath0-coefficient is a mean quantity taken over ensemble of convective vortexes .",
    "number @xmath2 of the vortexes in solar convective shell is large however much smaller then , say , the avogardo number , so fluctuations being proportional to @xmath3 may be not negligible .",
    "particular choice of @xmath2 is obviously model dependent however if we take just for orientation @xmath4 then @xmath5 .",
    "taking into account that @xmath0 is usually about 1/10 of turbulent velocity we consider a dozen percent of @xmath0-fluctuations as a comfortable estimate . from the other hand , governing equations for large - scale solar magnetic field deal with spatial averaging and have to include a contribution of @xmath0-fluctuations , @xcite .",
    "a straightforward application of the idea with vortex turnover time and vortex size as correlation time and length for @xmath0-fluctuations needs fluctuations much larger then mean @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite , @xcite based on experiences in direct numerical simulations , e.g. @xcite , and results of current helicity ( related to @xmath0 ) observation in solar active regions , e.g. @xcite considered @xmath0-fluctuations with correlation time comparable with cycle length and correlation length comparable with the extent of the latitudinal belts where sunspots occur to conclude that a reasonable @xmath0-noise of order of few dozen percents is sufficient to explain grand minima of solar activity . the aim of this paper is to apply this idea to explain waldmeier relations .",
    "the dynamo model is based on the standard mean - field induction equation in perfectly conductive media @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the mean electromotive force , with @xmath8 being the turbulent fluctuating velocity and magnetic field respectively ; @xmath9 is the mean velocity ( differential rotation ) .",
    "the axisymmetric magnetic filed : @xmath10 @xmath11 - polar angle .",
    "we have used the expression for @xmath12 obtained by @xcite ( hereafter p08 ) and write it as follows : @xmath13 tensor @xmath14 represents the alpha effect , including the hydrodynamic and magnetic helicity contributions , @xmath15 where the hydrodynamical part of the @xmath0-effect , @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the noise , and the quenching function , @xmath18 , are given in appendix ( see also in @xcite ) .",
    "the hydrodynamic @xmath0-effect term is multiplied by @xmath19 ( @xmath11 is co - latitude ) to prevent the turbulent generation of magnetic field at the poles .",
    "the contribution of the small - scale magnetic helicity @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is a fluctuating vector - potential of magnetic field ) to the @xmath0-effect is defined as @xmath22 , where coefficient @xmath23 depends on the turbulent properties and rotation , and is given in appendix .",

    "it seems to be reasonable that the helicity dissipation is most efficient in the near surface layers because of the strong decrease of @xmath29 ( see figure 1b ) .",
    "the last term in eq.([eq : hel ] ) describes the diffusive flux of magnetic helicity @xcite .",

    "similar to @xcite and @xcite , we use the time dependent conditions provided be eq.[eq : hel ] and the helicity flux conservation the condition @xmath50 is applied at the bottom and at the top of domain .",

    "the results for this model disagree with observations ( sidc data set ) about the shape of the simulated sunspot ( decay rate is higher than rise rate ) even though it is qualitatively reproduce the basic waldmeier relations for the rise rate - amplitude and the cycle period - amplitude ( see left column in fig .  [",
    "fig : wald ] ) .",
    "it was found that the variance of the cycle parameters in the long - term evolution is less than in 2d models .",
    "it is interesting , that under the level of noise the 1d models involving the magnetic helicity show the smaller mean even though having the stronger variances of the simulated sunspot parameters .",
    "although we could scale the mean parameters of those models to the observational values , we did not present the results for these models because they have the waldmeier relations which are quantitatively the same as those presented for 1d1 model in table 2 and fig .",
    "[ fig : wald ] .",
    "we checked the 1d models with the spatially variable shear like that suggested by kitchatinov et al .",
    "@xcite . in agreement with the helioseismology results , the given 1d models have the realistic latitudinal profile of the shear",
    "( see eq.([eq : shear ] ) ) . although , these models qualitatively reproduce the relation between the rise rate and amplitude of the cycle , they fail with the other kind of relations , having the positive correlation between the period and amplitude of the cycle and the equal rate for the rise and decay phase of the simulated sunspot cycles .",
    "similar to the 1d cases the magnetic helicity contribution to the @xmath0-effect results to decrease of the toroidal magnetic field strength and to growth the variance of the cycle parameters in the long - term evolution of the magnetic activity .",
    "the strong variance of the cycle parameters is expected from sidc data set and from nimv as well .",
    "for this reason in the paper we discuss the 2d model which involves the effect of the magnetic helicity .",
    "the 2d models employ two different description for the magnetic helicity loss , to overcome the problem of the @xmath0-effect catastrophic quenching .",
    "the term @xmath78 in eq.([eq : hel ] ) describes the magnetic helicity loss with the dissipation rate @xmath79 without specifying the nature of the loss .",
    "note , that @xmath29 is varied from about 2 months near bottom of the convection zone to a few hours at the top of the integration domain ( which is @xmath80 ) .",
    "thus , for the @xmath81 used in the model 2d1 , the typical decay time for the magnetic helicity is varied from about 4 solar cycles at the bottom of the convection zone to a time which is less than one month at the top of the convection zone .",
    "it is not clear if this simple description is satisfactory approximation for the magnetic helicity loss .",
    "therefore we checked the alternative possibility using the diffusive helicity flux .",
    "although , the model that employ the diffusive helicity flux is in satisfactory agreement with sidc data , the correspondence to observation in this model is not as good as for the model 2d1 .",
    "we find the the variance of the cycle parameters in the model 2d2 is less than in the model 2d1 while the sidc and nimv data sets show higher variances than the model 2d1 .",
    "the detailed comparison the results of our models with those given by karak and choudhuri @xcite is not possible , because we have used a different definition for the amplitude of the cycle and the rise time .",
    "they did not give the results for the linear fits coefficients and only provide the correlation coefficients in the waldmeier relations involving the rise rate - amplitude and the rise time - amplitude of the cycle .",
    "bearing in mind the differences in definition that their `` high diffusivity model '' with fluctuating meridional circulation is comparable with our 2d1 and 2d2 models .",
    "it is not clear however what is the typical shape of the cycle in their model .",
    "this is an important issue as we have seen in example given by model 1d1 .",
    "it has qualitative agreement with sidc data about the period - amplitude and the rise rate - amplitude relations even - though having the rise time of the cycle greater than the decay time .    in the models under consideration ,",
    "the asymmetry between the ascent and decent phase of the sunspot cycle is inherent from the pattern of the toroidal magnetic field activity . in particular",
    ", the 1d1 model has the toroidal magnetic field butterfly diagram with maximum located very close to equator .",
    "therefore , applying the definition eq.([eq : wolf ] ) for this type of the toroidal magnetic field evolutional pattern we obtain the decent phase of the sunspot activity shorter than the ascent phase .",
    "the opposite situation is in 2d models .",
    "there , we relate the sunspot activity with the toroidal field in the subsurface layers .",
    "the turbulent diffusivity in the model decrease outward this leads to increases the decay time when the toroidal field gets closer to the surface ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we find that the effect of the magnetic helicity on the @xmath0-effect can amplify or saturate the asymmetry of the cycle shape depending on the mechanisms of the helicity loss employed in the model .",
    "it is expected that the nonlinear dynamo mechanisms affect both the magnetic cycle profile and the statistical properties of the cycles .",
    "the paper illustrates the impact of the non - linear @xmath0-effect for the algebraic and the dynamic non - linearities .",
    "recently , kitchatinov & olemskoy @xcite suggested that the non - linear diffusion could promotes the events similar to the maunder minimum provided there are the small fluctuations in the @xmath0-effect .",
    "this mechanism does not work in _ our models _",
    ", because on the rise phase of the cycle , the growing toroidal magnetic fields results to the turbulent diffusivity quenching and this effect makes the rise phase of the cycle longer , i.e. , the smaller turbulent diffusion , the longer evolutionary time scale .",
    "the opposite situation is expected for the decay phase of the magnetic cycle .    the comparison of the sidc data set and the synthetic data set provided by nagovizyn et al .",
    "@xcite(nimv ) reveals the significant difference in the statistical properties of the cycle parameters .",
    "this seems to be a result of the wider cycle variations range covering by the nimv data set .",
    "the model presented in the paper do nt cover the variations seen in nimv because the selected models almost have no the extended events with low cycles like the so - called maunder minimum which were observed during the 16-th century .",
    "this motivated us to extend our study and explore the models which have the more intermittent variations of the sunspot cycle .",
    "this work is planned for the future papers .    summarizing the main findings of the paper we conclude as follows .",
    "we found that the dynamo models , having the reasonably good the time - latitude diagram of the toroidal magnetic field evolution , are able to reproduce qualitatively the inclination and dispersion across the waldmeier relations with less than 20% gaussian fluctuations of the @xmath0-effect .",
    "the 2d models have better agreement with observations than 1d .",
    "in particular , 1d models fail to reproduce the asymmetric shape of the sunspot cycle with short rise and long decay phases .",
    "the statistical distributions of the cycle parameters show the log - normal probability distributions for the all data sets analysed in the paper .",
    "the parameters of these distributions are different for all data sets .",
    "again the 1d model is significantly different from others in this sense . the 2d model that employs the simplest form of the helicity loss via the term @xmath78 agrees well with the sidc , even - though",
    "the long - term variations in this model is not intermittent enough , and this seems to be a reason for its difference to the nimv data set in some aspects .",
    "the employ of the diffusive loss in the magnetic helicity evolution equation results to decreasing in the variations of the cycle parameters .",
    "the further study of the magnetic helicity transport mechanisms should clarify the likely candidates which are responsible for the magnetic helicity loss from the dynamo region .",
    "we have seen that the analysis of the statistical relations of the sunspot cycle may provide the valuable diagnostic tool for this study .",
