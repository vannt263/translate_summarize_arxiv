    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the only quantum field theory of the standard model whose _ collective _ behaviour ( phase diagram and phase transitions ) is accessible to study in the laboratory .",
    "high - energy heavy - ion ( aa ) collisions offer the only experimental means known so far to concentrate a significant amount of energy ( @xmath0(1,10 tev ) at rhic , lhc ) in a `` large '' volume ( @xmath1 @xmath2 ) at thermalization times of @xmath3 1 fm/@xmath4 ) .",
    "the study of the many - body dynamics of high - density qcd covers a vast range of fundamental physics problems :    * * deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration * : lattice qcd calculations predict a new form of matter at energies densities above @xmath5 1 gev/@xmath2 consisting of an extended volume of deconfined and bare - mass quarks and gluons : the quark gluon plasma ( qgp )  @xcite .",
    "the scrutiny of this new state of matter ( equation - of - state , order of the phase transition , ... ) promises to shed light on fundamental questions of the strong interaction such as the nature of confinement , the mechanism of mass generation ( chiral symmetry breaking , structure of the qcd vacuum ) and hadronization , which still evade a thorough theoretical description due to their highly non - perturbative nature  @xcite . * * early universe cosmology * : the quark - hadron phase transition took place some 10 @xmath6s after the big - bang and was the most important event taking place in the universe between the electro - weak ( or susy ) transition ( @xmath7 s ) and big bang nucleosynthesis ( @xmath8 200 s ) . depending on the order of the qcd phase transition , several cosmological implications such as the formation of strangelets and cold dark - matter ( wimp ) clumps or baryon fluctuations leading to inhomogeneous nucleosynthesis , have been postulated  @xcite . * * parton structure and evolution at small-@xmath9 * : at high energies , hadrons consist of a very dense system of gluons with small ( bjorken ) parton fractional momenta @xmath10 . at low-@xmath9 ,",
    "the probability to emit an extra gluon is large @xmath11 and non - linear @xmath12 processes will eventually dominate the parton evolution in the hadronic wave functions . whereas hera results indicate that for @xmath1310@xmath14 , the parton evolution with @xmath15 ( or @xmath16 ) is described by the usual dglap ( or bfkl ) equations , at lower values of @xmath9 and around a saturation momentum of @xmath17 2 gev@xmath18 , such a configuration is theoretically described in terms of the `` colour glass condensate '' ( cgc ) picture  @xcite .",
    "since the nonlinear growth of the gluon density depends on the transverse size of the system ( i.e. @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the number of nucleons in the nucleus ) , the effects of gluon saturation are expected to set in earlier for ultrarelativistic heavy nuclei than free nucleons . *",
    "* gauge / string duality * : theoretical calculations based on the anti - de - sitter / conformal - field - theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence permit to obtain results in strongly coupled ( @xmath21 ) su(@xmath22 ) gauge theories in terms of a weakly - coupled dual gravity theory  @xcite .",
    "recent applications of this formalism for qcd - like @xmath23 super yang - mills theories have allowed to compute transport properties of experimental relevance , - such as the qgp viscosity  @xcite , the `` jet quenching '' parameter @xmath24  @xcite , or the heavy - quark diffusion coefficient  @xcite - , from black hole thermodynamics calculations .",
    "such results provide valuable insights on dynamical properties of non - perturbative qcd that can not be directly treated by lattice methods .",

    "in addition , the brahms observation of suppressed yields of moderately high-@xmath27 hadrons in dau at forward rapidities ( @xmath39 3.2 )  @xcite , as well as the `` geometrical scaling''-like behaviour of the nuclear pdfs observed for @xmath400.017  @xcite , are also consistent with gluon saturation expectations .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that both results are in a kinematic range with relatively low momentum scales , @xmath0(1 gev ) , where non - perturbative effects can blur a simple interpretation based on partonic degrees of freedom alone . indeed , at rhic ( and hera )",
    "energies the saturation momentum , - the scale at which non - linear effects become important and start to saturate the parton densities - , is in the transition between the soft and hard regimes ( @xmath41 2 gev@xmath18 ) . at lhc",
    "the relevance of low-@xmath9 qcd effects in hadronic collisions will be certainly enhanced due to the increased ( i ) center - of - mass energy @xmath25 , ( ii ) nuclear radius @xmath42 , and ( iii ) rapidity @xmath28 of the produced partons .",
    "indeed , at lhc energies not only the relevant bjorken @xmath9 values will be 3070 times lower than at rhic : @xmath43 at central ( forward ) rapidities for processes with a hard scale @xmath4410 gev , but also the saturation momentum , @xmath45 5  10 gev@xmath18  @xcite , will be in the perturbative range .",
    "the bulk of hadron production ( @xmath46 2 gev/@xmath4 ) in auau at rhic shows strong collective effects known as radial and elliptic flows .",
    "on the one hand , the measured single hadron @xmath27 spectra have an inverse slope parameter larger than that measured in pp collisions , increasing with reaction centrality and hadron mass as expected if collective expansion effects blue - shift the hadron spectra ( fig .",

    "such an azimuthal flow pattern is a truly collective effect ( absent in pp collisions ) consistent with an efficient translation of the initial @xmath9-space anisotropy in non - central reactions ( with an almond - shape overlap zone ) into a final `` elliptical '' asymmetry in @xmath49-space .",
    "the amount of elliptic flow is quantified via the second fourier coefficient @xmath50 of the @xmath48 distribution relative to the reaction plane .",
    "the large @xmath51 0.2 measured in the data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hydro ] , right ) indicates a strong degree of collectivity ( pressure gradients ) developing in the first instants of the collision .",
    "indeed , elliptic flow develops in the initial phase of the reaction and quickly self - quenches beyond @xmath32 5 fm/@xmath4 as the original spatial eccentricity disappears .",
    "this is confirmed by the observation that not only light hadrons but charm quarks ( indirectly measured via the semileptonic decays of d mesons into @xmath52 ) show a @xmath53 signal as large as 10%  @xcite clearly consistent with strong collective correlations during the _ partonic _ phase of the reaction .",

    "the fast ( local ) thermalization times , the robust collective flow generated in the first instants of the reaction , and the excellent agreement of the data with ideal hydrodynamics models which assume a fluid evolution with zero viscosity , have been presented  @xcite as evidences that the qgp formed at rhic is a strongly coupled liquid ( characterized by coulomb coupling parameter @xmath59 1 ) rather than a weakly interacting gas of partons .",
