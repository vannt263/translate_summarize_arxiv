    "quantum mechanical laws can be utilized to enhance the performance of a large spectrum of information transmission protocols  remarkable discoveries in the last two decades  which can potentially revolutionize communication networks .",
    "examples include classical information transfer through a quantum channel ( quantum dense coding ) @xcite , arbitrary quantum state transmission with the use of two bits of classical communication and a shared quantum state ( quantum teleportation ) @xcite , and secret transmission of classical information ( quantum cryptography or quantum key distribution ) @xcite .",
    "these protocols form the main pillars in the development of quantum communication @xcite , and at the same time , are the basic ingredients for quantum computational tasks @xcite . that the protocols have already been experimentally realized in a variety of substrates ,",
    "makes the field all the more exciting .",
    "these include the realizations in photonic systems , by which quantum communication protocols can now be implemented between nearby cities and islands ( see e.g. @xcite , and references therein ) . and in ion trap systems , where quantum communication protocols can potentially be useful in a future quantum computer realized in that system ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "however , while quantum communication protocols between two parties have received a lot of attention , both on the experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite fronts , the same is rather limited in the multiparty scenario .",
    "this is despite the fact that multi - access quantum communication networks involving several senders and receivers have immense applications and form one of the ultimate goals of such studies .",
    "the multiparty scenario presents a very rich structure indeed .",
    "see e.g. @xcite , and references therein .",
    "in particular , while capacities for classical as well as quantum information transmission has a one - to - one correspondence with the shared entanglement between the sender and the receiver in a bipartite situation ( single sender and a single receiver ) , the multiparty case does not lend itself to such a direct correspondence in every setting .",
    "certain multi - access quantum capacities of multiparty quantum states can _ not _ be related to its multiparty entanglement content , irrespective of the mode of quantification of the multiparty entanglement @xcite . here",
    "we show that in physically realizable quantum spin models used as multi - access quantum networks , the capacity of transmitting classical information is related to the genuine multiparty entanglement content of that network .",
    "the genuine multiparty entanglement content is quantified by the recently introduced generalized geometric measure @xcite , while the quantum spin models considered are the one - dimensional anisotropic quantum @xmath0 models , with nearest - neighbor interactions , and with a transverse field @xcite .",
    "we consider both ordered as well as quenched disordered @xmath0 spin systems .",
    "the disordered models that we consider are ( i ) the quantum @xmath0 spin glass  the randomness appearing in the coupling constant , ( ii ) the quantum @xmath0 model with a random transverse field , and ( iii ) the quantum @xmath0 spin glass with a random transverse field .",
    "disordered systems form one of the centerstages of studies in many - body physics @xcite .",
    "in particular , a lot of attention is recently being given to quantum spin glass systems ( disordered couplings , with or without a disordered transverse field ) ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "disordered systems appear due to certain environmental conditions and other parameters in the system that are not possible to control experimentally .",
    "one may expect that disorder would reduce properties like magnetization , conductivity , etc .",
    ", of a given system , and is indeed true for a large variety of systems .",
    "however , phenomena where disorder enhances magnetization and other properties of a system are also known to occur in both classical and quantum systems @xcite .",
    "studies in quantum transport have shown that disordered systems are always worse than ordered ones for carrying quantum information @xcite . however , we find that the ground states of a class of quantum spin models with disorder , for certain values of the impurity parameters , can give a clear advantage for carrying classical information encoded in a quantum state , over the corresponding ordered system . moreover , we observe that the disorder can enhance the amount of genuine multipartite entanglement of the ground state in the quantum spin model , and this is found in almost the same range in which the disorder - induced amplification of the multiport capacity is obtained .",
    "technological limitations currently restricts the physically realizable genuinely multiparty entangled quantum states to about 10 qubits @xcite .",
    "moreover , photonic systems are widely envisaged as the substrates for quantum communication protocols , and in that case , currently available technology limitations are even stricter on the number of qubits @xcite .",
    "we have therefore focused our attention on quantum communication protocols involving 7 or 8 parties , constituting the sending and receiving ports of the communication protocol .",
    "however , our investigations with a few more parties have shown that the qualitative behavior remains the same .",
    "see the discussion in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] .    the quantum @xmath0 spin chain can be solved exactly by using the jordan - wigner transformation @xcite .",
    "since we will be interested in finding global properties of the multiparty quantum states generated from the corresponding disordered spin models , and in particular will be engaged in finding out a genuine multiparty entanglement measure , we will have to carry out the computations by exact diagonalization .",

    "and often there exists a critical coupling constant below which the system shows this behavior .",

    "bob s aim is to gather as much information as possible , about the index @xmath36 , by performing quantum mechanically allowed measurements on the two - particle ensemble that is in his possession now .",

    "we will now investigate the behavior of genuine multipartite entanglement ( as quantified by generalized geometric measure ) and capacity of dense coding in multiport scenarios , in the ground states of different quantum @xmath0 spin models .",

    "( [ xy ] ) .",
    "we consider the ground states of the models for the comparisons .",
    "this is dictated by the fact that while the ggm can be obtained efficiently for arbitrary _ pure _ multiparty quantum states ( of arbitrary number of parties and dimensions ) , it is much harder to find it for mixed quantum states .",
    "this feature of ggm is similar to that of most other measures of entanglement , where calculations for pure states is much easier than for mixed states .",

    "the multiport channel capacity that we consider _ can _ however be efficiently calculated for mixed states also .",
    "but since one of our main interests lie in the comparison of the behavior of ggm with that of the multiport capacity , with the introduction of disorder , we only work with the ground states of the models , and in regions in which there is no degeneracy in the ground state .",
    "we will have occasion to discuss more on the issue of degeneracy , later in the paper .      in this subsection , we compare the values of ggm and the multiport channel capacity in the quantum @xmath0 spin glass with those of the quantum @xmath0 model .",
    "the hamiltonian for the ( ordered ) quantum @xmath0 model is given in eq .",
    "( [ xy ] ) and that for the ( disordered ) quantum @xmath0 spin glass model hamiltonian is given in eq .",
    "( [ jihamil ] ) .",
    "let us first consider the calculations for ggm . for the ordered system , we find the ggm in the ground state of the system .",
    "for the disordered system , we find the ggm in the ground state for a particular realization of the disorder , and then average over the disorder .",
    "we perform calculations for upto 8 spins in a periodic chain .",
    "the results for odd and even number of spins are significantly different , and we display the plots here for @xmath71 and for @xmath72 .",
    "[ fig : jn910ggm ] .",
    "the plots for other odd and even number of spins are qualitatively similar , respectively to the presented plots . for the plots",
    ", we have chosen the anisotropy parameter ( @xmath73 ) in the hamiltonians as 0.7 .",
    "the plots for the other anisotropies are qualitatively similar .    for the comparison",
    ", we find the ggm for the ordered system for a particular value of @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "we then find the quenched averaged ggm in the disordered system , where the transverse field is fixed at @xmath76 , and where the @xmath14 s are all i.i.d",
    ". quenched random variables , with each @xmath77 following the gaussian distribution with mean @xmath78 and unit standard deviation .",
    "for each value of the mean , @xmath78 , the quenched average is taken over @xmath79 realizations .",
    "we have also performed numerical simulations for higher number of realizations , and have checked that the corresponding quenched physical quantities have already converged .    for an odd number of spins ,",
    "the quenched averaged ggm in the disordered system is always higher than the ggm in the corresponding ordered system . for an even number of spins",
    ", there is a `` cross - over value '' , @xmath80 , of @xmath81 , before which the quenched averaged ggm in the disordered system is larger than the ggm in the ordered system .",
    "therefore , there are distinct regimes where introduction of disorder enhances the amount of genuine multiparty entanglement present in the quantum system @xcite .",
    "the existence of entanglement in a quantum system , consisting of several subsystems , indicates the thermodynamic signature of high global order in the whole system while the local order in the subsystems is low @xcite .",
    "this disparity between global and local order is particularly pronounced in a maximally entangled state , e.g. the singlet state , where the global order is complete ( the global state is pure ) while the local order is completely absent ( the local states are completely depolarized ) .",
    "what we show is that this disparity between global and local order , in the sense of increasing genuine multipartite entanglement , can be enhanced by introducing disorder into the system .",
    "the interplay of global and local order to create entanglement is intrinsic to the multiparty quantum state under consideration .",
    "it is intriguing to see that agents of disorder that are external ( in the sense that they can be externally manipulated on the system ) can interact with the intrinsic order - disorder mechanism , to produce an increase of entanglement by increasing the disorder .",
    "we now move over to the comparison of the information carrying capacities of the same systems .",
    "the channel capacity that we consider will have multiple senders and a single receiver . for the ground state of a system of @xmath6 spins",
    ", we assume that @xmath82 spins are in possession of @xmath82 alices ( who act as senders ) while the remaining spin is in possession of bob ( who will act as the receiver of the information ) . due to symmetry of the system , it is immaterial as to which spin is in possession of bob , in the sense that the capacity will be independent of that choice .",
    "similarly as for the ggm , the multiport capacity behaves differently for odd and even number of spins . in fig .",
    "[ fig : jn910cap ] , we plot the normalized capacities for @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the situation is qualitatively similar for other odd and even spins , respectively . just like for ggm ,",
    "the quenched averaged capacity in the disordered case is always better than the capacity in the ordered situation , if the total number of spins is odd , while for even @xmath6 , there is a cross - over @xmath83 , until which the capacity of the disordered case is better than that of the ordered hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , again there arises situations where introduction of disorder into the system increases the information carrying capacity of a quantum system .",
    "additionally , we find that it is necessary to have an order - from - disorder feature for multiparticle entanglement , to have the same in the multiport capacity .",
    "in other words , we observe that @xmath84 in all the cases considered .",
    "we term the disorder - induced enhancements for the genuine multiparty entanglement as well as the multiport capacity as `` order - from - disorder '' , since a higher efficiency ( in the sense of increased genuine multiparty entanglement , which results in an increased multiport capacity , and possibly increased capacities for other quantum communication tasks ) in the generated ground state is obtained by introducing disorder into the physical system under consideration .      for the ordered hamiltonian , scanning over different values of the coupling constant",
    "is physically equivalent to scanning over the transverse field .",
    "it may seem plausible that similarly , sweeping over different mean values of the coupling constant in the disordered hamiltonian is equivalent to sweeping over mean values of a disordered transverse field .",
    "however , we show below that introduction of a gaussian disorder in the transverse field produces a qualitatively different behavior for the ggm as well as the multiport capacity , as compared to their behavior after introduction of a gaussian disorder in the coupling constant .    as in the preceding subsection",
    ", we consider the ground state of the ordered hamiltonian ( eq .",
    "( [ xy ] ) ) for given @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and find the ggm and the multiport classical capacity .",
    "we then compare them with those obtained from the ground state of the disordered hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ hihamil ] ) , for @xmath74 and for i.i.d . quenched random variables @xmath17 , with each @xmath85 distributed as @xmath86 , i.e. , with mean @xmath87 and unit standard deviation . and again , in the disordered case , the averaging over the disorder is performed after the physical quantity has been calculated for randomly obtained values of the disorder parameter .",
    "[ fig : hn910ggm ] and [ fig : hn910cap ] .",
    "in contrast to the situation when disorder is introduced in the coupling constants ( as discussed in the preceding subsection ) , there are now cross - overs for both odd and even total number of spins .",
    "that is , for both odd and even total number of spins , there are cross - over values , @xmath88 , of @xmath89 , before which the quenched averaged physical parameters are lower than the corresponding physical parameter in the ordered hamiltonian , and after which the situation is the opposite .",
    "there does however appear a difference between the odd and even cases , but it is of a separate kind .",
    "precisely , the ordered hamiltonian for an odd number of spins has a degenerate ground state for low @xmath90 , and as said before , we will therefore disregard this range of @xmath90 .",
    "the ground state is however nondegenerate for the whole range of @xmath90 for an even number of spins .",
    "this feature for odd @xmath6 was also obviously present in the considerations of the preceding subsection , for high @xmath91 , and were also disregarded there .",
    "just like when we introduced disorder in the coupling constants , again we have obtained distinct regimes where introduction of disorder in the transverse field enhances the genuine multipartite entanglement as well as the multiport channel capacity of the quantum system . and",
    "again , a disorder - enhancement in ggm is necessary for a similar feature in the capacity .",
    "we have already investigated the situations where disorder is introduced into the quantum system through separate channels  via coupling constants and via transverse magnetic fields .",
    "introduced separately , both have given rise to regimes where disorder enhances the amount of a genuine multiparty entanglement as well as the amount of a multiport channel capacity .",
    "the question that we want to raise now is whether the two types of disorder , if introduced _ together _ , will still allow for regimes of disorder - enhanced physical quantities .",
    "this is not a priori obvious as the effects of disorder - enhancement due to the two types of disorder may not work in tandem , and may , in principle , completely wash out the disorder - enhancement phenomena .",
    "this however is not the case , as we show now .",

    "* regions iii . *",
    "finally , in the remaining portions of the @xmath98 regions plotted , the ordered hamiltonians have degenerate ground states , and and are thereby disregarded .",
    "these are the white regions in the bottom right of the plots .",
    "they should not be confused with the white boundary between regions i and regions ii , which indicates an equality between the quenched averaged physical quantity and that obtained from the ordered hamiltonian .",
    "going over to the case where the total number of spins is even , we find that the the picture is simpler here , as there is no degeneracy observed in the region under study , and consequently there are no regions iii here .",
    "see the lower plots in figs .",

    "summarizing , we have found that the ground states of several quenched disordered quantum spin systems , in the presence of certain ranges of the disorder parameters , have higher genuine multipartite entanglement than in their counterparts in systems without disorder . in almost the same range of parameters ,",
    "the ground states of disordered models turn out to be better carriers of classical information than their equivalents in systems without disorder .",
    "the models considered include the quantum anisotropic @xmath0 spin glass with and without a random transverse magnetic field .",
    "the calculations are performed by exact diagonalizations , and subsequent quenched averaging , whenever required .",
    "the results shown in the plots displayed in the paper are given , for definiteness , for a specific value of the anisotropy parameter @xmath73 .",
    "however , we have performed the calculations for a large range of @xmath73 , and the general qualitative behavior is similar for all @xmath73 . to exemplify the genericity of the qualitative behavior obtained from the previous plots in the paper ,",
    "let us present a figure ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ggmgamma ] ) where we plot the quenched averaged genuine multipartite entanglement for different values of @xmath73 , in the spin glass hamiltonian @xmath67 .",
    "one of the aims of the study was to investigate the relation between genuine multiparty entanglement and the capacity of classical information transfer in these specific systems .",
    "the results displayed until now are all for systems of eight spins , and this is dictated by the approximate number of spins which can be experimentally accessed coherently in quantum systems .",
    "however , such boundaries are steadily being extended and improved @xcite . in this light , it is important to mention here that the results obtained in this paper are resilient with respect to moderate changes of the total number of spins . as an evidence for that , in fig .",
    "[ 10spinsevidence ] , we show that disorder - induced advantage seen until now for @xmath72 is valid also for @xmath100 .",
    "we term the phenomenon of increased genuine multiparty entanglement and increased multiport capacity subsequent upon the introduction of disorder into the system as order - from - disorder .",
    "experimental and theoretical work in quantum information processing in the last two decades or so have gradually convinced us that the phenomenon of entanglement , observed in a variety of physical systems , is not a fragile quantity .",
    "we hope that this work will add to that increasing belief .",
