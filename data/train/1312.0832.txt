    "the pseudoscalar mesons such as @xmath8 appear as the nambu - goldstone ( ng ) bosons .    recently , in order to investigate the mechanism of the dynamical mass generation , partial restoration of the chiral symmetry in the nuclear medium has gained considerable attention .",
    "this phenomenon is incomplete restoration of chiral symmetry with sufficient reduction of the absolute value of the chiral condensate in the medium and will lead to various changes of hadron properties .",

    "the leading density correction to the chiral condensate is determined by the @xmath9n sigma term @xmath10 and with the empirical value of the sigma term it has been found that the leading correction gives enough large contribution at the normal nuclear density : @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the in - medium and in - vacuum condensate and @xmath14 is the normal nuclear density .",

    "we do not take the exact limit of @xmath360 in the evaluation .",
    "nevertheless , we have to deal with the singularity , because the wave function renormalization would have inconsistent density dependence with the low density expansion and we may make evaluation of the physical quantities very close to the singular point , where the results are numerically unreliable .    the origin of the singularity seen in the derivative of the loop function at @xmath361 can be identified when one performs derivative of eq .   in terms of @xmath347 and takes @xmath362 : @xmath363 the integral gets divergent when the integrand takes @xmath364 at the end point of the integral .",
    "this singularity is very similar with the infrared divergence in quantum field theory .",
    "such infrared divergence should be cancelled with other diagrams emitting soft pions , when one calculates scattering rates , not in the amplitude itself .",
