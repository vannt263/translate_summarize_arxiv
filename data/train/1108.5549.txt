    "an acquaintance of non - relativistic holographic theories with z @xmath6 1 tells that we can construct a plethora of explicit time dependent backgrounds by utilizing the distinguished role of time .",

    "two pioneering works of aging in holographic setup have been put forward in @xcite@xcite by generalizing schrdinger background @xcite@xcite with explicit time dependent terms .",

    "see also @xcite for similar observations of general time dependent deformations of schrdinger backgrounds .    along the line of schrdinger backgrounds",
    "@xcite@xcite , there have been progresses with much interest . their finite temperature generalizations with the thermodynamic analysis can be found in @xcite and transport properties are analyzed in @xcite , recently .",
    "these solutions are constructed nicely using the null melvin twist @xcite@xcite . there also have been efforts constructing schrdinger solutions from string or m theory , sometimes with supersymmetry .",

    "we give conclusion .",
    "in this section , we start with a brief review of aging holography based on recent papers @xcite@xcite and also fix some notations .",
    "the relevant geometry is simple and possesses lots of isometries , yet there are many difficulties in its fundamental level .",

    "globally_. we come back to this below .    there exist several valuable observations in @xcite , which are related to the geometry in equation ( [ agingbacmet ] ) and worthwhile to be mentioned :    * the metric ( [ agingbacmet ] ) is connected to the schrdinger background ( [ schbackrmet ] ) by a local , but _ singular _ , coordinate transformation @xmath19 this singular time dependent coordinate change is a key to realize aging symmetry .",
    "it does not generate curvature singularities at any point in spacetime .",
    "it is argued in @xcite that this coordinate singularity in this context is similar to a black hole horizon , where physical boundary conditions are imposed , and thus has profound effects , from the gauge / gravity point of view .",
    "this geometry is called _ locally schrdinger _ in @xcite .",
    "thus it is important to impose physical boundary conditions on the time boundaries in addition to the spatial boundaries . * thus , locally , the aging background has the full schrdinger symmetry with modified set of generators , especially the time translation ( @xmath20 ) and special conformal transformation ( @xmath21 ) generators as @xmath22 the other relevant symmetry generators are not changed by the coordinate transformation ( [ coordinatechange ] ) @xcite . globally the time translation symmetry is broken and the aging symmetry is realized as conformal schrdinger symmetry modulo time translation , and described by the generators @xmath23 . *",
    "the analysis is done with the complex @xmath24 , especially at @xmath25 , and also the geometry is extended to be complex with complexified parameter @xmath26 in @xcite . with real @xmath26 ,",
    "the resulting correlator has the time dependence only in its phase . to achieve a relaxation process",
    ", @xmath26 should be complex .",
    "+ we show that there is a way out from complexifying the geometry by utilizing the fact that @xmath7 can be considered as an _ internal _ coordinate from the holographic point of view .      in a similar manner , we start with the ads in light - cone @xcite @xmath27 which is shown to be another viable candidate for the schrdinger holography .",
    "this metric can be obtained from the ads metric with the following coordinate change @xmath28 this coordinate transformation was introduced in @xcite@xcite@xcite and should be viewed as a two - step procedure : a boost in the @xmath29-direction with rapidity @xmath30 , followed by transforming to light - cone coordinates .",

    "it is further required to identify the coordinate @xmath24 as time and also to have a momentum projection along the other coordinate @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath7 direction provides an isometry to the background and thus the corresponding momentum gives the central element @xmath17 which serves as the total particle number or the mass of the resultant non - relativistic theory .",
    "furthermore this ads in light - cone is known to have a well defined holographic renormalization and as simple as the case of ads black holes @xcite .",
    "it has been known that the schrdinger background and the ads in light - cone share the same physical properties such as thermodynamic @xcite and transport properties @xcite .",
    "we would like to investigate whether this similarity extends to this time dependent settings or not .    with the _",
    "singular _ coordinate transformation ( [ coordinatechange ] ) and a notation change @xmath37 , we obtain the following metric @xmath38 which is simpler than that of the aging background ( [ agingbacmet ] ) .",
    "one may note that @xmath39 is a dimensionless parameter .",
    "it can be shown that this metric shares the similar properties as the geometry ( [ agingbacmet ] ) , mentioned in the previous section [ sec : agingbac ] .",
    "first , the metric ( [ aginglcmetric ] ) is locally ads in light - cone , while time translation symmetry is broken globally by the _ singular _ coordinate transformation which connects these two metrics ( [ aginglcmetric ] ) and ( [ adslcmet ] ) .",
    "second , the isometry of the metric ( [ aginglcmetric ] ) is aging symmetry with the same set of the generators given in ( [ modifiedisom ] ) .    with these properties in mind ,",
    "let us investigate the background ( [ aginglcmetric ] ) .",
    "for this purpose , we change the coordinate as @xmath40 and concentrate on the five dimensional background with @xmath41 and the metric becomes @xmath42 where the boundary sits at @xmath43 . let us couple the background with a probe scalar @xmath44 , whose action has the following form @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "we used @xmath48 for the boundary cutoff , which is small and will be sent to zero eventually .",
    "the linearized field equation for @xmath44 becomes @xmath49 note that here we treat @xmath7 coordinate special and replace all the @xmath50 as @xmath51 , because this coordinate plays a distinguished role in the schrdinger holography .",
    "later on we consider the parameter @xmath17 to be either _ real _ or _ imaginary _ , from the observation that the coordinate @xmath7 can be treated as an internal coordinate from the field theory point of view .      to find the solution of the equation ( [ blukscalareq ] ) , we use the fourier decomposition as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the momentum vector for the corresponding coordinates @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath55 is introduced for the calculation of the correlation functions and is determined by the boundary condition with the normalization @xmath56 . and @xmath57 is the kernel of integral transformation that convert @xmath58 to @xmath59 , which is necessary for our time dependent setup",
    ".    with this fourier mode , the differential equation ( [ blukscalareq ] ) decomposes into time dependent part and radial coordinate dependent part .",
    "the time dependent equation and its solution read @xmath60 the radial dependent equation is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "an analytic solution is available in terms of bessel functions as @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are bessel functions with @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "for this solution to be well defined , we need to impose two different physical boundary conditions , one in deep inside the bulk and another at @xmath68 , because we consider only @xmath69 . to have a well defined field deep in the bulk",
    ", we choose @xmath70 over @xmath71 , @xmath72 which is exponentially converging for large @xmath73 , deep in the bulk .",
    "thus the full solution is @xmath74 thus we confirm that the aging scalar function is scale - invariant prefactor @xmath75 times that of the schrdinger background , advertised in @xcite @xmath76    we consider the @xmath7 coordinate as the one for the internal manifold and restrict the system to be a sector with an eigenvalue @xmath17 .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 would be real if the @xmath7 coordinate is periodic as in discrete light cone quantization .",
    "we assume that the @xmath7 has boundaries , for example , at @xmath77 and take @xmath17 to be a general complex number .",
    "this seems to accord with the the boundary at @xmath78 .",
    "it would be natural to expect that the imaginary @xmath17 would represent the dissipative behavior of the system .",
    "let us consider the radial fall offs of the wave solution of the scalar field with the conformal dimension @xmath79 .",
    "at the boundary @xmath80 , the solution behaves as @xmath81 note that we consider complex @xmath82 for notational simplicity .",
    "below , we will consider real @xmath83 and imaginary @xmath84 cases separately to make the distinction clear .",
    "it is worthwhile to pause and have some comments .",
    "first , the conformal dimension of the scalar field @xmath44 is the same as in ads in light - cone because the factor @xmath75 is scale invariant and thus does not contribute to the scaling dimension , which is observed in @xcite .",
    "second , as a result , the fall - off behavior of the scalar wave solution at the boundary changes for the case @xmath84 .",
    "this explicitly demonstrates that the correct scaling dimension of some operators can not be read off just from the behavior of the radial wave solution in the time dependent holography .",
    "third , this change of the radial wave solution can be viewed as `` wave function renormalization '' and should not be canceled by additional counter terms , as observed in @xcite .",
    "physical quantities would have appropriate time dependence to compensate this extra effect .",
    "this will be explicitly demonstrated by evaluating the correlation functions below .",
    "we further require the scalar wave solution to behave well as it approaches to @xmath85 , because @xmath68 also serves as a boundary .",
    "this is similar to the boundary condition imposed deep inside the bulk along the @xmath73-direction , which leads physically reasonable results below . to check the behaviors",
    ", we calculate the wave solution , equation ( [ agingwavefunction ] ) , near the boundary in coordinate space for the massless case @xmath86 with @xmath84 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 as @xmath89 this shows the typical behaviors of the wave solution in the coordinate space .",
    "one sees that the wave solution converges at @xmath68 for @xmath90 due to the exponential factor and also converges at @xmath91 for @xmath92 due to the polynomial factor .",
    "this demonstrates the convergence of the wave solution at the time boundaries for the imaginary @xmath84 . from the fact that the asymptotic forms of the wave solution and two point correlation function are restricted by aging symmetry",
    ", one expects to get similar exponential and polynomial factors for more general cases .",
    "we follow @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite to compute the correlation functions by introducing a cutoff @xmath48 near the boundary and normalizing @xmath93 , which fixes @xmath94 .",
    "let us consider the on - shell action , which has two different contributions , the terms proportional to @xmath95 and to @xmath96 , as @xmath97       & = \\int d^3 x   \\frac{l^5}{u^5 }   ~\\phi^ * ( u , x^+ , \\vec y ) ~\\left(\\frac{u^2}{l^2}\\partial_u + i m \\frac{\\alpha u}{l^2 }   \\right ) \\phi ( u , x^+ , \\vec y ) \\big |_{u_b } \\;. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this can be recast using the equation ( [ agingwavefunction ] ) as @xmath98 where @xmath99 represents the existence of the physical boundary along the time direction as @xmath100 , and @xmath101 is given by @xmath102 note that the spatial integration along @xmath103 can be done to give delta function @xmath104 .",
    "one can bring the @xmath105 factors in @xmath106 and @xmath107 together to cancel each other , which removes the second part in @xmath108 . then using the relation @xmath109",
    "one can evaluate the @xmath73-dependent part at @xmath110 at the boundary by expanding in terms of small @xmath48 to obtain the non - trivial contribution in @xmath101 as @xmath111 note that the function @xmath101 is only function of @xmath58 and @xmath112 when it is evaluated at the boundary .",
    "thus the time independent part is the same as previously considered cases in @xcite @xcite@xcite .",
    "but this is not the end of the story . to obtain the final form of the momentum correlation function",
    ", we need to evaluate the time dependent part . here",
    "we consider two cases , @xmath83 and @xmath84 with real parameters @xmath113 and @xmath114 , separately .",
    "one can perform the @xmath24 integration in equation ( [ wholeeq ] ) to get the following results , because of the step function and vanishing exponent , @xmath115 , @xmath116 thus the momentum correlation function has two parts @xmath117 where @xmath101 is given in equation ( [ fffunction ] ) .",
    "this is the final form of the momentum space correlation functions .",
    "note the extra term present due to our boundary condition with step function in time domain .",
    "let us evaluate the coordinate correlation function as in front of the boundary scalar operator is opposite to that of the corresponding scalar field in ( [ agingwavefunction ] ) .",
    "the scaling dimension of the aging scalar operator is effectively different by @xmath118 compared to that of the schrdinger case @xmath119 = [ \\phi_{\\text{schr\\\"odinger } } ] +   i \\alpha m \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as read off from the radial fall - offs in equation ( [ finalwavefunction ] ) .",
    "this should be compensated by an appropriate time dependent factor .",
    "another way to see this is the the relation @xmath120 where the time dependent factor would result in opposite way .",
    "this is the same for the case with @xmath84 discussed below . ]",
    "@xmath121 for further calculations , we use the following integral @xmath122 with the condition @xmath123 , and the inverse transform of @xmath124 as @xmath125 where we used @xmath126 and @xmath127",
    ". then the coordinate space correlation function is @xmath128 this is our main result for the zero temperature correlation function with @xmath129 .",
    "we would like to pause to comment :    * we find that the time dependent polynomial part is the same as the result @xcite when @xmath130 .",
    "this is associated with the fact the the scaling dimension of a boundary scalar operator is opposite to that of the source of the corresponding scalar field . @xmath131",
    "* it turns out that there exist only oscillating behaviors for @xmath129 .",
    "thus the same is true for real value for @xmath132 , because there exists only the combination @xmath132 .",
    "* for the massless case with @xmath133 , we have @xmath134 thus the coordinate space correlation function is given by @xmath135      let us evaluate the time integral first .",
    "we perform the fourier transform for the time range @xmath100 , and define @xmath136 .",
    "then @xmath137 where @xmath138 .",
    "note that these results are essentially the same as those evaluated by laplace transform in , so called , @xmath139-domain .",
    "thus we get the momentum correlation function as @xmath140 again , @xmath101 is given in equation ( [ fffunction ] ) , and @xmath141 . here",
    "we can have @xmath142 due to the spatial translational invariance , but not for @xmath58 because time translation symmetry is broken .",
    "let us calculate the coordinate space correlation function as @xmath143 after carrying out the integral for the @xmath144 first @xmath145 the expression reduces to the previous case for the time independent part , whose calculation is done similarly .",
    "we get @xmath146 this is the result we are looking for .",
    "this confirms that the correlation function has dissipative behavior for @xmath147 .",
    "thus    * we find that the time dependent polynomial part is identical to the result @xcite when @xmath130 .",
    "this is associated with the fact the the scaling dimension of a boundary scalar operator is opposite to that of the source of the corresponding scalar field . @xmath148 * there exist only the combination @xmath132 , and thus the result is true for imaginary @xmath132 .",
    "* for the massless case with @xmath133 , we have the coordinate space correlation function similar to the @xmath83 case as @xmath149    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      in this section we consider the aging holography from the generalized schrdinger background @xcite@xcite@xcite generated through the null melvin twist .",
    "the action is given by @xmath150 where @xmath151 and @xmath152 are a massive vector field and the associated field strength , and @xmath44 is a dilaton .",
    "the black hole geometry associated with the action was found as @xmath153   \\nonumber \\\\ & + k^{1/3 } \\left ( r^{2 } d\\vec{y}^{2 } + \\frac{dr^{2}}{r^{2 } h } \\right ) \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath154 the massive vector field and dilaton also have the non - trivial configurations as @xmath155    following the previous section , we use the local coordinate transformation ( [ singulartr ] ) to generate aging black hole inherited from the schrdinger background as @xmath156 + k^{1/3 } \\left ( r^{2 } d\\vec{y}^{2 } + \\frac{dr^{2}}{r^{2 } h } \\right)\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the massive vector field @xmath157 \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can check that the metric reduces to that of @xcite when @xmath158 and also to that of @xcite@xcite@xcite when @xmath159 by construction . one can make sure that these configurations satisfy the einstein equation .    we consider a probe free scalar on this background following the section [ sec : finiteteq ] with the same equation of motion ( [ probeeq ] ) . using the mode expansion @xmath160 we can separate the @xmath59 dependent part of the differential equation with the same operator @xmath161 given in equation ( [ timeop ] ) .",
    "the solution of the time dependent part is exactly the same as before , @xmath162 .",
    "this is one of the main observation for the aging backgrounds compared to the aging in light - cone .    upon changing @xmath163 and @xmath164 ,",
    "the @xmath165dependent equation becomes @xmath166 with the same temperature relation @xmath167 and with @xmath168 for the notational convenience .",
    "again , this differential equation is identical to that of the schrdinger backgrounds , confirming the general relations ( [ finalwavefunction ] ) , ( [ agingschrcorrreal ] ) and ( [ agingschrcorrim ] ) in the schrdinger black hole backgrounds . from these observations ,",
    "we argue that the local coordinate transformation ( [ coordinatechange ] ) brings the same time dependent factor @xmath169 for @xmath83 given in equation ( [ agingschrcorrreal ] ) and @xmath170 given in equation ( [ agingschrcorrim ] ) to the correlation functions for the holographic aging phenomena .",
    "this equation ( [ schrmassiveeq ] ) is the same as the corresponding equation ( [ massiveeq ] ) of the ads in light - cone except the following change @xmath171 which is another main observation of this section .",
    "we would like to comment about the consequences of this change without detailed investigation of this differential equation .    * in general , @xmath172 depends on the radial coordinate , which is crucially different from the case of ads in light - cone .",
    "in there , the corresponding term in equation ( [ massiveeq ] ) is constant and thus it is possible to consider the case @xmath173 consistently . on the other hand ,",
    "it is not possible to ignore this term for the aging schrdinger case in general with non - zero @xmath17 .",
    "this seems to be the first non - trivial evidence that there exist differences between the two different geometric realizations of schrdinger holography . *",
    "@xmath172 is non - singular and monotonically increasing function from @xmath174 at the boundary to @xmath175 at the horizon .",
    "* this is the finite temperature generalization of the difference between the ads in light - cone and the schrdinger backgrounds , @xmath176 , which remains to be true at the boundary even at finite temperature .",
    "thus we conclude that the differential equation of the aging background is the same as that of the ads in light - cone at the asymptotic region .",
    "it seems that the differential equation ( [ schrmassiveeq ] ) is similar to the massive case of aging in light - cone given in ( [ massiveeq ] ) .",
    "it remains to be seen the differences in detail with further investigations , which we postpone for the future .",
    "in this paper we studied the time dependent aging systems by considering their dual gravity solutions with relevant symmetry , namely aging symmetry .",
    "we mainly focused on ads in light - cone for the field theory with schrdinger symmetry and its aging generalizations to incorporate the aging phenomena . using these geometries , we study the two - point correlation functions of the dual scalar fields in aging system at zero temperature as well as those in schrdinger system at finite temperature . at zero temperature ,",
    "the two - time correlation function of the dual scalar fields exhibit all the relevant features of the typical aging system . among others",
    ", it shows that the older is the system the slower it relaxes . at finite , but low , temperature with schrdinger isometry",
    ", the analysis of momentum space correlation function exhibits the exponentially decaying behavior as a function of the inverse temperature .",
    "one of the important features in the schrdinger holography and also in aging holography is the existence of the spectator direction in the bulk geometry .",
    "one usually chooses an eigenvalue @xmath17 in that @xmath7 direction , which appears as an extra free parameter in the boundary conformal field theory . in order to deal with",
    "the time dependent , open and dissipative system , it is tempting to relax the nature of this spectator or , more appropriately , internal direction and allow @xmath17 to be a complex eigenvalue .",
    "indeed , we could see that all the relevant features of the two - time correlation function in boundary aging system are revealed from the imaginary part of @xmath17 .",
    "another important point in this paper is the clear differences we found between aging in light - cone and aging backgrounds at finite temperature .",
    "they are the conformal dimensions of the scalar operators and the mass dependence of the differential equations , which can be understood simply from the differences in the effective mass , @xmath177 in the former and @xmath178 for the latter . for ads in light - cone , we evaluate two - point correlation functions in momentum space for massless scalar case , @xmath86 , with finite @xmath17 using numerical method and analytic approaches for two special cases , low and high temperature limits .",
    "it seems to be possible to connect this case to read off the viscosity in ads in light - cone with finite @xmath17 for general setup , while that was not possible in schrdinger background due to the presence of @xmath179 in the fluctuation of the gravity modes .",
    "further systematic investigations are required to see the details , while preliminary analysis is presented in [ sec : viscosity ] .",
    "thus ads in light - cone and its generalization to aging seems to be more attractive in their physical applications at finite temperature on top of the simplicity and well - defined boundary structure .",
    "surely , we still need to clarify many issues to use the ads / cft correspondence for the time dependent field theory .",
    "further extensive study of the aging system in this paper may shed some lights on the study in this direction .",

    "the first four coefficients are @xmath197 these two solutions , near boundary and near horizon solutions , can be connected numerically . and the two - point correlation function is given by @xmath198 in terms of various parameters we are interested in .",
    "the finite temperature hydrodynamic correlation functions for the off - diagonal component of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath199 were evaluated for the schrdinger background in @xcite@xcite , while that of the ads in light - cone was done in @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to recall that the viscosity - entropy ratio for the strongly coupled non - relativistic plasma also satisfies the universal bound , @xmath200 @xcite@xcite@xcite for @xmath201 with vanishing parameters including @xmath17 as confirmed in section [ sec : hightcorr ] .",
    "if we demand @xmath202 , the calculations are simple and effectively identical to those with the wave equation for a massless scalar field of ads@xmath203 black hole .",
    "let us revisit the earlier treatments to evaluate the shear viscosity concentrating on schrdinger geometry , which essentially used the scalar correlation functions , as advertised in @xcite . while it is straightforward to identify the correlation functions of the energy - momentum tensor to those of scalar operators for the relativistic case with the vanishing spatial momenta , there exist subtleties due to the internal direction in the non - relativistic schrdinger case .",
    "it is argued in @xcite that @xmath204 is required to evaluate the shear viscosity in the schrdinger background .",
    "the scalar operator has the conformal dimension @xmath205 in the schrdinger backgrounds , while the gravity modes have the conformal dimension @xmath206 .",
    "thus it is required to put @xmath207 to calculate the shear viscosity using the scalar operator , and thus restricted to the sector , @xmath204 .",
    "the story is different for the ads in light - cone . as we mentioned in several places ,",
    "we concentrate on the fixed sector of @xmath17 and we would like to consider the fluctuation equation of the off - diagonal component as in @xcite @xmath208 which satisfy the following differential equation @xmath209 thus we are supposed to solve this differential equation directly to get the correlation functions related to the metric fluctuations .",
    "this equation is nothing but the scalar differential equation given in ( [ massiveeq ] ) with @xmath86 , expressed in the @xmath210-coordinate .",
    "now a crucial difference comes into play .",
    "note that the conformal dimension of a scalar operator is given by @xmath211 .",
    "thus we can just restrict ourselves to the case @xmath86 , which is already taken care of in ( [ massiveeq ] ) .",
    "this made it possible to read off the viscosity , for general sector @xmath17 , readily from the boundary two - point correlation of the scalar fields using the equation ( [ metricfluc ] ) .",
    "this would be regarded as a crucial difference between the ads in light - cone and schrdinger backgrounds in the finite temperature case .",
    "we defer the systematic analysis for finite @xmath17 with full generality to the future .    for @xmath86 ,",
    "being required by the conformal dimension of the energy momentum tensor , and @xmath204 , being required by the condition @xmath191 ( this restriction would be lifted for general setup ) , we can read off the shear viscosity from the equation ( [ imfffinal ] ) @xmath212 where we use the entropy formula from @xcite and take into account the factor @xmath70 in front of the action ( [ scalaraction ] ) .",
    "this is the advertised entropy - viscosity ratio of the strongly - coupled non - relativistic fluid advertised in @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
