    "experiments of a new generation , with relativistic nuclei , at rhic and sps are currently under consideration with the aim to intensify the search for the existence and location of the qcd critical point in the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter @xcite .",
    "important developments in lattice qcd @xcite and studies of hadronic matter at high temperatures @xcite suggest that the qcd critical endpoint is likely to be located within reach at sps energies .",
    "it is therefore desirable to explore the range of baryon number chemical potential @xmath0100 - 500 mev by studying collisions at relatively low energies , @xmath15 - 20 gev per nucleon pair .",
    "a decisive observation , in these experiments , associated with the development of a second - order phase transition at the critical endpoint of qcd matter is the establishment of power laws in momentum space ( self similarity ) in close analogy to the phenomenon of critical opalescence in qed matter @xcite .",
    "these power laws reflect the fractal geometry of real space , and a characteristic index of the critical behavior is the fractal mass dimension @xmath2 which measures the strength of the order - parameter fluctuations within the universality class of critical qcd @xcite .",
    "the physics underlying the endpoint singularity in the qcd phase diagram is associated with the phenomenon of chiral phase transition , a fundamental property of strong interactions in the limit of zero quark masses . in this case and for a given chemical potential @xmath3 there exists a critical temperature @xmath4 above which chiral symmetry is restored and as temperature decreases below @xmath4 , the system enters into the chirally broken phase of observable hadrons .",
    "it is believed that , for two flavors and zero quark masses , there is a first - order phase transition line on the @xmath5 surface at large @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this line ends at a tricritical point beyond which the phase transitions become of second order . in the case of real qcd with",
    "non - zero quark masses , chiral symmetry is broken explicitly and the first - order line ends at a critical point beyond which the second - order transitions are replaced by analytical crossovers @xcite .    the order parameter of the chiral phase transition is the chiral field @xmath6 formed by the scalar , isoscalar field @xmath7 together with the pseudoscalar , isovector field @xmath8 .",
    "both fields are massless at the tricritical point and when the symmetry is restored at high temperatures , their expectation value vanishes , @xmath9 . however , in the presence of an explicit symmetry breaking mechanism ( non - zero quark masses ) the pion and sigma fields are disentangled at the level of the order parameter of the qcd critical point , which is now formed by the sigma field alone .",
    "the expectation value of the @xmath7-field remains small but not zero near the critical point so that the chiral symmetry is never completely restored .",
    "the valuable observables in this case are associated with the fluctuations of the @xmath7-field , @xmath10 , and they incorporate , in principle , the singular behavior of baryon - number susceptibility and in particular the power - law behavior of the @xmath7-field correlator @xcite .    the aim of this work is to study the evolution of critical correlations during the development of the collision , in the neighborhood of the qcd critical point . in the initial state",
    "we assume that the system has reached the critical point in thermal equilibrium so the @xmath7-field fluctuations are described by the @xmath11 ising critical exponent @xmath12 and in particular by the fractal dimension @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the crucial question from the observational point of view is whether in the freeze - out regime , which follows the equilibration stage , the relaxation time - scale @xmath15 of these fluctuations is long enough compared to the time - scale @xmath16 associated with the development of a massive @xmath7-field beyond the two - pion threshold ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "both time - scales ( @xmath18 ) are characteristic parameters of the out - of - equilibrium phenomena ( @xmath7 rescattering ) which take place during the evolution of the system ( towards freeze - out ) and the requirement @xmath19 guarantees that critical fluctuations may become observable in the @xmath7-mode ( @xmath20 @xcite ) .    in order to quantify these effects ,",
    "we adopt in this work the picture of a rapid expansion ( quench ) which is a realistic possibility in the framework of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "we study the out - of - equilibrium evolution of the initial fractal characteristics of the @xmath7-field and we search for time scales @xmath18 satisfying the above constraint in a particular class of events ( event - by - event search ) .",
    "the dynamics of the system is fixed by a two - field lagrangian , @xmath21 , together with appropriate initial conditions .",
    "the out - of - equilibrium phenomena are generated by the exchange of energy between the @xmath7-field and the environment which consists of massive pions initially in thermal equilibrium .    in section",
    "ii the formulation of the problem and in particular the equations of motion , the initial conditions and the generation of thermal @xmath22-configurations are presented . in section iii numerical solutions of the evolution of critical fluctuations",
    "are given and discussed whereas in section iv our final results and conclusions are summarized .",
    "in our approach we assume an initial critical state of the system in thermal equilibrium , disturbed by a two - field potential @xmath23 , in an effective description inspired by the chiral theory of strong interactions @xcite .",
    "the 3-dimensional lagrangian density is @xmath24 with the potential @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the potential has the usual @xmath7-model form plus a term which breaks the symmetry along the @xmath7-direction . with the addition of the mass term for the pion field ,",
    "we ensure that it has a constant mass equal to @xmath28 . finally , the constant terms in ( [ pot ] ) shift to zero the value of the potential at the minimum .",
    "we fix the parameters of the lagrangian using the phenomenological values @xmath28@xmath29 mev and @xmath30 mev , whereas the known uncertainty in the phenomenological value of zero temperature @xmath7-mass , given by @xmath31 , yields @xmath32 for @xmath33 mev .",
    "the equations of motion resulting from ( [ lagr ] ) are : @xmath34 where @xmath35 .    using a constant value @xmath36 in eq .",
    "[ pot ] implies a non - vanishing mass ( finite correlation length ) for the @xmath7-field , @xmath31 , in contradiction with its critical profile .",
    "this inconsistency is restored if we assume a finite - time mechanism instead of the instant quench i.e the instantaneous formation of the potential ( [ pot ] ) at @xmath37 .",
    "the simplest model which leaves the equations of motion unaffected , used also in cosmological phase transitions @xcite , is the so - called linear quench @xcite .",

    "we first describe in the following subsections the generation of an ensemble of field configurations on a 3-d lattice possessing the characteristics of the critical system .",

    "all the characteristics of the @xmath22-ensemble such as the correlation function @xmath90 , which turns out to be a @xmath12-function , are consistent with the assumption of an ideal thermal gas .",

    "we observe the remarkable phenomenon that the characteristic exponent @xmath108 after reaching the value of the embedding dimension 3 , it fluctuates and for particular times it becomes almost equal to @xmath110 .",
    "thus , after the first deformation , the initial critical behavior of the whole ensemble is partially restored and deformed repeatedly . a detailed explanation of this revival is given in @xcite .",
    "the key point is that the partial restoration takes place when @xmath111 passes through its lower turning point , where the @xmath7-field ( seen as a system of coupled oscillators ) reaches a state similar to the initial one .",
    "this phenomenon weakens gradually , and finally the dynamics dilutes completely the initial critical behavior .",
    "this phenomenon is also visible in the evolution of the slope @xmath112 of @xmath100 versus @xmath49 , for each configuration . indeed , in fig .",
    "[ 1confslope ] we demonstrate the evolution of the mean field value as well as of @xmath113 and of its time average , for @xmath114 and @xmath115 fm , for three independent configurations of the ensemble , corresponding to initial value @xmath116 equal to 2.51 , 2.50 and 2.53 respectively .",
    "we observe an oscillatory behavior of @xmath112 similar to that of @xmath108 of the whole ensemble presented in fig .",
    "[ slopetotal ] .    in a heavy ion collision , if the fireball passes near the critical point we expect @xmath7 to have almost zero mass",

    "however , when it reaches the threshold @xmath118 , at time @xmath119 , it starts decaying into pions , and the decay rate of @xmath20 , being proportional to the available phase space parameter @xmath120 , becomes larger as @xmath43 increases .",
    "so if the critical characteristics of @xmath7 have survived at that threshold , they can be transferred to the produced pions , leaving signatures of the critical point at the detectors .",
    "note here that these pions are not affected by the thermal ones which constitute the environment . in figs .",
    "[ slopetotal ] and [ 1confslope ] the vertical line depicts the threshold time @xmath119 .",
    "we are interested in investigating the time averaged measures after this threshold since these quantities are observable .",
    "the first measure one has to look at is the evolution of @xmath108 and @xmath121 for the whole ensemble , after @xmath119 , as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ slopetotal ] .",
    "as we observe these vary between 2.6 and 2.9 , for the various @xmath103 and @xmath39 values , offering weak traces of the initial power law of 5/2 .",
    "this cogitation is amplified by the fact that if we evolve our system with conventional initial conditions ( @xmath122 ) , then @xmath108 and @xmath121 remain always @xmath123 , as we have tested , supporting the assumptions that slopes @xmath124 indicate initial critical behavior .",
    "however , slopes close to 3 could originate from conventional strong processes leading to power - law correlations with very small intermittency exponents @xcite .",
    "therefore we have to refer to more sophisticated measures in order to acquire a direct observation of the qcd isothermal critical exponent @xmath12 , independently of the specific model . one way to achieve",
    "this is to perform event - by - event analysis of our results .",
    "as we have mentioned , we use an ensemble of @xmath7-field configurations , each one possessing its own @xmath72 which can vary , leading to a distribution with mean value @xmath125 and standard deviation @xmath74 .",
    "an event - by - event analysis of the system evolution consists in calculating the percentage @xmath126 of the initial configurations ( all of which have @xmath127 ) that possess again this value at time @xmath128 ( actually we count those with @xmath129 ) .",
    "obviously , @xmath130 leads to experimentally accessible effects after @xmath119 . in fig .",

    "[ slopetotal ] .",
    "as we mentioned above we can define the relaxation time - scale @xmath15 , after which the initial critical behavior is completely lost , as the time where @xmath131 becomes less than 0.5% .",

    "the quench duration seems to affect the results significantly . for quench time",
    "@xmath115 fm the aforementioned time averaged @xmath133 can be quite large for the first 1 - 2 fm after @xmath119 , as can be observed in fig .",

    "the effect of @xmath147 ( that is the value of the @xmath43 at @xmath104 ) is not so crucial and @xmath15 shows a small decrease with decreasing @xmath147 , while @xmath16 increases slightly .",

    "this is the main difference of the two @xmath103 cases , although the corresponding plots look alike .",
    "the discussion above reveals that the critical behavior of the @xmath7-field will sustain , in a significant percentage of the initial configurations , for times after the @xmath7 s start to decay , thus transferring the critical profile to the produced pions , despite the abrupt non - equilibrium evolution from its initial equilibrated state .",
    "it is important to exclude the inverse possibility , i.e appearance of events with fractal geometry being generated out of the evolution of conventional initial conditions .",
    "therefore , we perform the following test : we evolve our system using an ensemble of @xmath7-configurations with random initial conditions .",
    "this conventional profile always possesses @xmath151 with a very small standard deviation ( @xmath152 ) . in this case not even one configuration ( out of @xmath92 ) acquires slope @xmath153 ever , while the distribution becomes even narrower as times passes . as a consequence , @xmath130 and @xmath131 are always exactly equal to zero , within the used population .",

    "this result is more transparent in an event - by - event study of the phenomenon , where the evolution of individual configurations is investigated .    as a consequence of this study , the fractal dimension of critical fluctuations in qcd matter , turns out to be a remarkable index for the location of the qcd critical point , in experiments with nuclei , of relatively high statistics .",
    "in fact , it remains robust , in a class of events , against dynamical effects and it leads to a characteristic pattern of intermittent fluctuations @xcite in transverse momentum space , providing us with a signature of the critical point without ambiguities owing to dynamics .",
