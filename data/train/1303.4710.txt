    "the structure of elliptical galaxies , as inferred from surface brightness profiles , is the most direct method of deriving the size , luminosity and density scale parameters that are key to understanding the details of galaxy formation .",
    "this type of information has become increasing important as our successful @xmath8cdm cosmological simulations begin to focus on smaller scale cluster and galaxy sized predictions ( tonini 2010 , trujillo - gomez 2011 ) .",
    "current formation scenarios range from gravitational collapse on short timescales to extended structure evolution by mergers of gas - rich ( wet ) and gas - poor ( dry ) companions in a hierarchical fashion ( steinmetz & navarro 2002 ) .",
    "determining the characteristics of structure in present - day galaxies is also a critical step to understanding structural changes at high redshift ( chevance 2012 ) .",
    "interpretation of surface photometry commonly uses fitting functions , which were introduced to surface brightness profiles to provide parametrization after it was discovered that ellipticals varied in structure in a uniform fashion with size or luminosity .",
    "a simple set of parameters would allow for quantitative classification of ellipticals and the identification of structure components that might be related to kinematic properties .",
    "in addition , describing structure with fitting functions provides an avenue to locate evolutionary signatures ( such as mergers , dust lanes or tidal interactions ) and allows for comparison to theoretical predictions of galaxy structure ( mosleh 2013 ) .",
    "ultimately , uniform structure described by a simple function implies homology for galaxy formation ( bertin 2002 ) with the hope of revealing a universal profile shape that reflects the underlying baryonic and dark matter distributions ( navarro 1997 , merritt 2006 ) , although similarity may be a function of both structure and kinematics ( navarro 2010 ) .",
    "the mechanical goal of fitting functions is to reduce the 2d shape of the surface brightness profile to a set of simple parameters that are mathematically related .",
    "this would , in effect , allow for the complete reconstruction of the luminosity density of a galaxy from a small set of values . however , simply finding a spline - like function that matches all the data points is inadequate for a description of a profile as it would have too many variables and does not allow meaningful comparison of those values with other photometric or kinematic properties of galaxies .",
    "the mathematically simplest formula is expected to be the one that provides the greatest correlation between structural and photometric characteristics and , therefore , revealing more of the underlying physics .",
    "the history of fitting functions is tied to the technological progress of galaxy photometry from the early days of photographic plates to the advent of electronic detectors ( e.g. , ccd s ) . through the infancy of galaxy photometry , the fitting functions for ellipticals progressed from the reynold s ( 1913 ) model , to hubble s ( 1930 ) , a modified hubble ( rood 1972 ) and",
    "lastly a truncated hubble model ( oemler 1976 ) ( see graham 2011 for a complete review ) .",
    "parallel to these efforts , which focused on the halo fits ( the region beyond the half - light radius ) in order to reveal mass density , was the @xmath0 law developed by de vaucouleurs ( 1953 ) primarily to confine the curves of growth for aperture photometry .",
    "the @xmath0 surface brightness law , as first outlined by de vaucouleurs ( 1948 ) , was first reinforced as the fitting function of choice by its excellent representation of the deep surface photometry of ngc 3379 ( de vaucouleurs & capaccioli 1979 ) . while shown to be inadequate for dwarf ellipticals , the popularity of the @xmath0 law continued into the 1980 s to the point where it was considered a universal fit to all ellipticals , and deviations from a @xmath0 fit were interpreted as the result of tidal interactions ( kormendy 1977 ) .",
    "the universality of the @xmath0 law was questioned with the discovery that the its two variables , effective radius ( @xmath9 ) and surface brightness ( @xmath10 ) , were coupled and decreased the meaning of their correlations ( kormendy 1980 , schombert 1986 ) .",
    "in addition , it was shown in schombert ( 1987 ) , that ellipticals deviated from the @xmath0 law in a systematic fashion with luminosity . clearly , two parameters were insufficient to adequately describe the structure of ellipticals over a full range of luminosities , even excluding dwarfs and giant cd galaxies ( schombert 1987 ) .",
    "the need for addition parameters to capture additional shape beyond the @xmath0 law resulting in the adoption of the srsic ( 1963 ) generalization , a @xmath1 model , where effective radius and surface brightness are joined by a concentration variable , @xmath3 .",
    "this fitting function has the immediate advantage in that the srsic @xmath1 model runs from exponential ( i.e. , @xmath11 , well suited for disk galaxies and dwarf ellipticals ) to @xmath0 ( i.e. @xmath12 ) and higher values of @xmath3 for brighter luminosity ellipticals",
    ". another benefit of the srsic @xmath1 model was its application as a photometric plane for ellipticals ( graham 2002 ) , an analogous relation to the fundamental plane .",
    "extensions of the srsic @xmath1 model are used to interpret high resolution space imaging ( graham 2005 ) , but our study focuses only on the outer regions of ellipticals .    the goal of this paper , the second in our series on the structure of galaxies , is examine the usefulness of fitting functions in describing the outer isophotes of ellipticals .",
    "the success in the srsic @xmath1 model for parameterizing the core regions ( those regions inside the half - light radius , typically between 4 and 6 kpcs ) of ellipticals is well established ( graham & guzman 2003 ) .",
    "however , a majority of those studies focus on the inner isophotes , at the sacrifice of information from the halo . in this paper ,",
    "usefulness of both the @xmath0 law and the srsic @xmath1 model to the halos of ellipticals will be examined , and what scaling relations can be extracted for this most common type of galaxy in rich , dense environments .",
    "as described in paper i ( schombert & smith 2012 ) , the images for this study are taken from the 2mass image archive .",
    "the 2mass project was a nasa ground - based , all - sky , near - ir sky survey ( skrutskie 2006 ) .",
    "2mass uniformly scanned the entire sky using two 1.3-m telescopes ( north kpno and south ctio ) .",
    "each telescope was equipped with a three - channel camera , where each channel consisting of a 256x256 hgcdte detector .",
    "each camera was capable of observing the sky simultaneously at @xmath13 ( 1.25 microns ) , @xmath14 ( 1.65 microns ) , and @xmath15 ( 2.17 microns ) .",
    "the 2mass arrays imaged the sky in a drift - scan mode .",
    "each final pixel consisted of six pointings on the sky for a total integration time of 7.8 sec per pixel .",
    "the final image frames have a plate scale of one arcsec per pixel with typical depth of 24 @xmath13 mag arcsecs@xmath16 ( errors at 0.5 mags ) .",
    "the sample was selected by morphological criteria from the revised shapley - ames ( rsa ) and uppsala galaxy catalogs ( ugc ) .",
    "all the galaxies must be pure e classification in both catalogs .",
    "in addition , the selected galaxies had to be free of nearby companions or bright stars which might disturb the analysis of the isophotes to faint luminosity levels and sufficiently small in angular size to cover only two 2mass strips .",
    "the final sample contained 428 galaxies and covers apparent @xmath13 magnitudes from 7 to 11.5 and absolute @xmath13 magnitudes from @xmath1721 to @xmath1726 . in the process of reducing the surface brightness profiles",
    ", it was found that the galaxies divided into two subsamples that will be discussed in paper iii .",
    "for this study , 311 clean ellipticals with clear single component profiles were isolated .",
    "images from 2mass for regions around all the galaxies in the sample were downloaded from 2mass s interactive image service .",
    "these sky images were flattened and cleaned by the 2mass project and contained all the information needed to produce calibrated photometry .",
    "the images were analyzed as described in  3 of paper i. all the reduced photometry can be found at our data website ( http://abyss.uoregon.edu/ @xmath18js / sfb ) .",
    "since the @xmath0 law was the fitting function of choice for many decades , this function was fit to all the galaxies in our sample .",
    "the shortcomings to the @xmath0 law is well documented in graham ( 2011 ) and , in particular , it was shown by schombert ( 1986 ) that ellipticals are only @xmath0 in shape for a very limited range of surface brightness ( typically between 21 and 24 @xmath19 mag arcsecs@xmath16 ) and for a limited range in total luminosity ( i.e. , galaxies less than @xmath20 have no portion of their surface brightness profiles which are @xmath0 in shape ) .    following the prescription of schombert ( 1986 )",
    ", only that portion of the surface brightness profile which is linear when plotted in @xmath0 space is fit .",
    "this can be done in a subjective manner by visually selecting the inner and outer radii in a plot of @xmath21 versus @xmath0 , or can be automated by restricting the fit to between 19 and 22 @xmath13 mag arcsecs@xmath16 and searching for the best linear region .",
    "either method produces identical results in terms of similar structural correlations .",
    "the blue line indicates the exact @xmath0 shape , and it is clear that most ellipticals deviate above the @xmath0 law at large radii and that the @xmath0 shape fails for the inner regions ( @xmath22 kpcs ) .",
    "however , despite it s limitations for outer isophotes , the @xmath0 shape is so consistent for the middle regions that this fact must be address by any structural model . ]",
    "figure [ normal_re ] displays all the galaxies in our sample , normalized for their best @xmath0 fit .",
    "only data at radii greater than 2 arcsecs are displayed to avoid seeing effects .",
    "the deviations from the @xmath0 are clear to see in this figure , being typically higher in surface brightness at large radii than the @xmath0 law for bright galaxies , less than the @xmath23 law for faint galaxies . however , for the restricted range of surface brightness , the @xmath0 law is a good description of the interior structure of ellipticals .",
    "it is surprising that the arbitrary nature of the fitting process results in similar structural relations ( e.g. figure [ re_se ] ) .",
    "however , this is due to the coincidence of interior versus outer structure in ellipticals as compared to the @xmath0 law .",
    "ellipticals , typically , will have some downward turn in surface brightness in their interior regions due to having interior structure following a srsic model with @xmath24 ( graham 2011 ) .",
    "likewise , there is an upward turn in surface brightness at outer radii as can be seen in figure [ normal_re ] .",
    "this will result in a natural bias towards steeper slopes as one includes interior and exterior data .",
    "psf effects can also contribute to this problem and , as shown in paper i , 2mass images have measurable psf distortions out to 4 arcsecs .",
    "psf errors will distribute core luminosity outward , producing a shallower slope for inner isophotes .     fits for most ellipticals .",
    "the typical behavior for an elliptical profile is to curve fainter towards the core and brighter in the halo .",
    "this results in a subjective decision on which isophotes to use for fitting .",
    "the two ends drive @xmath9 and @xmath10 to larger values , although in such a fashion as to preserve the photometric @xmath10-log @xmath9 relation .",
    "the arrows indicate the range of isophotes used for each fit . ]",
    "an illustration of this effect is seen in figure [ ngc4187 ] .",
    "plotted is the surface brightness profile of ngc 4187 in @xmath0 space .",
    "a straight line is a good match to the @xmath0 law , as is shown by the blue line ( fit range indicated by blue arrows ) .",
    "however , a formal fit that includes only a few more interior and exterior points ( the red line and red arrows ) results in a fit that is 20% larger in effective radius ( @xmath9 ) and an effective surface brightness ( @xmath10 ) that is 35% fainter .",
    "when previous studies referred to the coupling of @xmath0 parameters ( trujillo , graham & caon 2001 ) , it is this effect that causes the coupling .",
    "notice that the bias in @xmath9 and @xmath10 results in the change in the measured structural parameters that is nearly parallel to the overall relationship between @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( the errors in the fit produce a @xmath25 , where the relation in figure [ re_se ] is @xmath26 ) , and is one of the main reasons the scatter is so small over such a large range in galaxy size and luminosity .    the resulting structural scaling relation , log @xmath9 versus @xmath10 , is shown in figure [ re_se ] .",
    "a jackknife linear fit gives @xmath10 = @xmath27 log @xmath9 + @xmath28 .",
    "also shown in the figure is the relationship from kormendy ( 1977 ) , corrected to an @xmath29 and a @xmath30 color of 3.5 ( @xmath10 = 3.28 log @xmath9 + 16.77 ) .",
    "the outliers with small @xmath9 and faint @xmath10 values are galaxies where , even with fitting restrictions , are not well fit by the @xmath0 law in any region of their surface brightness profile .",
    "the correlation is real from the uv to the near - ir , but the low scatter is , in some part , due to the coupling of the fit parameters .",
    "the structural values for a particular galaxy is much more uncertain than indicated by the tightness of the correlation .    ) and effective surface brightness ( @xmath10 ) for @xmath0 fits .",
    "the blue line is a jackknife linear fit , the dashed line is the relation from kormendy ( 1997 ) corrected for a mean @xmath30 color of 3.5 . despite different fitting techniques , three decades in time and 5000  in wavelength",
    ", the same relationship is found for the 2mass sample as the kormendy sample . ]",
    "the quality of the correlation underlies the success of the @xmath0 law for many years .",
    "for , even though the @xmath0 systematically fails to fit the outer portion of ellipticals , it does fit the middle portions where a majority of the light is located .",
    "the two fit variables give a crude map of the galaxy shape and correlate with various global parameters , such as total luminosity .",
    "so the @xmath0 law , although it fails as a descriptor of central concentration and halo extension , does serve as a basic indicator of mean galaxy size and luminosity density . but the inclusion of low luminosity ellipticals , which have no region of their profiles which are @xmath0 in shape , will destroy this relationship .",
    "the success of the srsic @xmath1 model derives primarily from the fact that it has an additional fitting parameter providing an extra degree of freedom .",
    "this immediate addresses the problem with the @xmath0 law in the outer regions by supplying more flexibility to the fitting function at large radii .",
    "however , a difficulty for the srsic @xmath1 model is that the @xmath3 parameter is sensitive to both the inner and outer shape of a galaxy profiles in a dependent fashion ( see graham & driver 2005 for a full review of the characteristics of the srsic @xmath1 model ) . as can be seen in figure [ n_index ]",
    ", the @xmath3 index drives the inner and outer profile fit upward ( brighter ) in surface brightness for higher values of @xmath3 ( higher @xmath3 equals more concentration of central light ) .",
    "normal psf and core effects ( e.g. , coreless versus core ellipticals , kormendy 2009 ) would serve to drive @xmath3 downward , while extended halos would drive @xmath3 upward .",
    "thus , there is no expectation that @xmath31 values are the same as @xmath32 values .",
    "an addition problem arises in that , when fitting the entire profile , inner data points have smaller errors ( plus more numerous data points as ellipse fitting in high luminosity regions are more compressed ) and , therefore , are given greater weight to most fitting algorithms .",
    "model @xmath3 index for typical values of @xmath10 and @xmath9 .",
    "lower @xmath3 provides more curvature to a profile shape , particularly useful for fitting low luminosity ellipticals and the core regions ( @xmath33 less than the half - light radius , @xmath34 ) of normal ellipticals .",
    "however , the outer isophotes of most ellipticals have shallower slopes ( i.e. , higher @xmath3 values ) producing a conflicting fitting process where lower scatter ( e.g. , greater weight ) core regions drive @xmath3 downward and shallower outer regions , but with higher uncertainties , drive @xmath3 to higher values .",
    "the regions for our inner and outer fits are indicated with respect to the half - light radius , @xmath34 . ]    for comparison , all 311 ellipticals were fit with a srsic @xmath1 model from the inner 5 arcsecs out to the half - life radius ( @xmath34 , this typically corresponds to a surface brightness of @xmath35 ) .",
    "this inner fit sample is than compared to a sample which is only fit from the point where the surface brightness profile becomes @xmath0 in shape outward ( this was between 3 and 5 kpcs ) to the outer most data points .",
    "all the fits use the isophote errors ( mostly the error in the sky value ) to weight the data points .",
    "note that @xmath3 values above 10 are effectively identical as their differences are asymptotically smaller for higher @xmath3 .",
    "unsurprisingly , the inner fit sample displays decreased @xmath9 ( by 60% ) and brighter @xmath10 ( by 70% , on average ) compared to fits made to the halo ( i.e. , the inner and outer regions are not fit by the same model ) .",
    "as seen in figure [ inner_outer ] , the @xmath3 index is smaller for interior fits by an average of 80% .",
    "this result is also independent of the fitting constraints , for fits made to the entire galaxy profile simply resulted in srsic @xmath1 model parameters identical to the inner fits as the outer data points had greater photometric errors and were given less weight by the fitting algorithms .",
    "model @xmath3 values obtained by fitting on the inner surface brightness profile ( from 2 arcsecs to the holmberg radius , 22 @xmath13 mag arcsecs@xmath16 ) versus outer fits ( from the @xmath0 region to the outermost isophotes ) .",
    "the shallower halos drive the @xmath3 index to 80% larger , on average , from the steeper core fits .",
    "this effect makes the srsic @xmath1 model ineffective as a universal description of the full luminosity density profile of an elliptical . ]",
    "the systematically different @xmath3 values between inner and outer fits implies that it is impossible to find a photometrically correct match to an entire elliptical surface brightness profile with a single component srsic @xmath1 model .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath31 is weakly correlated with @xmath32 in figure [ inner_outer ] , but the variance is too great for a single component fit .",
    "the effect on scaling relations can been seen in figure [ inner_outer_scale ] , the srsic @xmath1 model effective radius ( @xmath9 ) versus the @xmath3 index . when the fits are restricted to the inner regions",
    ", @xmath3 serves as a concentration index and has a fair correlation with the effective radius , which is a measure of the scale size of the galaxy ( trujillo 2001 ) .",
    "however , when the fits are restricted to the outer regions , the correlation with effective radius degrades , @xmath3 serving as a measure of the shape of the halo , and becomes very sensitive photometric errors from low surface brightness areas .",
    "the method of fitting will also clearly influence the results .",
    "for example , in figure [ inner_outer_scale ] , the data from caon ( 1993 ) is shown and clearly agrees with the inner fit distribution ( although the correlation is less evident than for the caon data ) .",
    "but , the caon data has lower @xmath3 values than those deduced for the outer fit sample , emphasizing the importance of @xmath3 as a concentration indicator for the core region of galaxies ( graham & guzman 2004 ) .",
    "psf effects are a concern with 2mass images , but the same difference in @xmath31 versus outer @xmath32 is evident even when the inner cutoff for the fit is varied .",
    "model @xmath3 index scaling relation for @xmath3 values determined from inner fits ( top panel ) versus outer fits ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the typically shallower profiles for ellipticals drives @xmath3 to larger values for outer fits .",
    "while the correlation is still evident , the scatter is much larger than for inner fits .",
    "the caon data is shown as red symbols , based on high resolution inner fits . ]    for the rest of the analysis in this paper , the srsic @xmath1 model is constrained to overweight the outer regions during fitting by restricting the fit to only those points from the midpoint of the @xmath0 region to the halo . in other words ,",
    "the fitting is performed from the radius where the inner isophotes becomes @xmath0 and continues outward , weighted by surface brightness error for the outer points .",
    "this inner limit is always beyond 5 arcsecs , so psf effects are negligible .",
    "other inner radii were tested , for example , 1/4@xmath34 , but all produced similar results .",
    "the resulting srsic @xmath1 parameters ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath3 ) are shown in figures [ inner_outer_scale ] and [ auto_fit ] .    ) and effective surface brightness ( @xmath10 ) for srsic @xmath1 model fits . the blue line is a jackknife linear fit , resulting in a similar relation to the @xmath0 fits in figure [ re_se ] .",
    "the green symbols are the data from caon corrected for color . ]    immediately obvious from figure [ auto_fit ] is that @xmath9 and @xmath10 has a similar correlation as found from the @xmath0 fits .",
    "the slopes are identical , but the zeropoint is shifted by 0.3 mags fainter . even though the @xmath3 index has a great deal of scatter , @xmath10 and @xmath9 are well correlated and , again , the low scatter is assisted by the coupling of @xmath10 and @xmath9 . while the additional",
    "free parameter increases the quality of the fits for the srsic @xmath1 model ( as measured by @xmath36 ) , in fact , there is no significant increase in the quality of the @xmath10 versus @xmath9 diagram over @xmath0 fits .",
    "the srsic @xmath3 parameter is weakly correlated with @xmath9 ( figure [ inner_outer_scale ] and @xmath10 ; however , the correlation is much weaker than that found by caon ( 1993 ) , shown as red symbols in figure [ inner_outer_scale ] .",
    "much of this difference is , of course , that caon focus on the use of @xmath3 as a central concentration parameter , giving higher weight to the inner isophotes of a galaxy .",
    "our procedure , to ignore inner isophotes , uses @xmath3 as a shape parameter for the halo .",
    "this appears to have the consequence of decoupling @xmath3 from @xmath9 and @xmath10 since these latter parameters are more strongly influenced by inner isophotes than outer ones ( see below ) .",
    "the weakness of the srsic @xmath3 parameter is also related to the large variance in fit parameters for similar quality fits .",
    "figure [ chi_grid ] displays the @xmath36 space around a range of @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath3 values for ngc 7626 .",
    "the @xmath36 test is not the optimal method for determining a best fit to a surface brightness profile for it assumes that the errors in the photometry are gaussian and random when , in fact , the errors at faint light levels is dominated by systematics in the sky value ( schombert & smith 2012 ) .",
    "however , it does have the advantage of simply comparing the fit to the data as a measure of the total residual value , and a straight forward weight by sky error can be applied to the outer isophotes .",
    "there is no attempt herein to assign a minimal @xmath36 value for an adequate fit , merely to use @xmath36 for comparison between various fit parameters .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ chi_grid ] , the @xmath36 determination for each fit is very shallow , and the slope of the error ellipse is roughly @xmath37 compared to the correlation slope ( figure [ auto_fit ] , @xmath38 ) .",
    "this means that , like the @xmath0 law , small errors in @xmath10 and @xmath9 vary the parameters along the correlation and errors in the fitting procedure work to reinforce the relationship . likewise , small changes in @xmath10 and @xmath9 also result in the @xmath3 index varying in a non - linear fashion ( top panel ) .     parameter space for",
    "srsic @xmath1 fits to ngc 7626 plotted against effective radius ( @xmath9 ) , effective surface brightness ( @xmath10 ) and the @xmath3 index .",
    "contour lines corresponds to lines of constant fit quality , @xmath36 , the square of the difference between the fit and the actual data .",
    "the regions of best fit between @xmath9 and @xmath10 are long , narrow ellipses , meaning that there is a wide range of these parameters that produce equally good fits .",
    "likewise , the @xmath36 contours for the @xmath3 index display a non - linear coupling with @xmath9 .",
    "the two indicated fits ( black symbols ) are the fits shown in figure [ compare_sersic ] . ]    in fact , a wide range of srsic parameters equally fit the profiles within the errors of the data .",
    "one example is found in figure [ compare_sersic ] , where the two fits ( indicated in figure [ chi_grid ] as black symbols ) are mapped onto the profile .",
    "there is a negligible difference in the quality of the fits , even though the fit parameters vary by up to 40% . while the fit shown in blue is numerally superior to the fit shown in red , within the errors of the photometry either fit is equally valid . yet",
    ", there is a significant difference in the fit parameters whose coupling allows for a much broader range in good fits than one would find acceptable as an analytic technique .",
    "the formal errors on the fits do not take this coupling into account , and the true uncertainties in the fitting parameters is much larger than quoted by many authors .",
    "model fits shown in figure [ chi_grid ] for ngc 7626 .",
    "while the blue fit has a slightly better @xmath36 value , it is clear that , within the photometric errors , either fit is equally valid . yet , the fit parameters ( @xmath10 , @xmath9 and @xmath3 ) vary by 40% . ]",
    "following the technique outlined in graham ( 2002 ) , the best fit srsic @xmath1 model parameters have been converted into  photometric plane  ( pp ) values .",
    "the pp is the photometric version of the fundamental plane , first presented by djorgovski & davis ( 1987 ) . for the pp , the @xmath3 index serves as a proxy for velocity dispersion , which produces an immediate observational advantage as photometric data is much easier to acquire than spectroscopic values .",
    "as our @xmath3 values are not as tightly tied to the interior concentration of an elliptical , it was not immediately obvious that the same photometric relations as found by graham ( 2002 ) could be extracted , although there is a weak connection between @xmath31 and @xmath32 .    ) and a linear combination of the concentration index @xmath3 and luminosity density ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the green line is a linear fit to the rms minimized value of b=0.15 .",
    "green data are the original caon ellipticals used to formulate the original photometric plane ( corrected for a @xmath30 color ) . ]    a best fit to pp values yields @xmath39 shown in figure [ photo_plane ] . also shown is the caon data , corrected to @xmath13 with a @xmath40 color .",
    "it is somewhat surprisingly that the near - ir pp exists in our sample as our @xmath3 values are based on outer fits , whereas the original pp was based on @xmath3 values that were weighted towards inner regions .",
    "our difference in slope for the @xmath3 index is primarily due to our different fitting methods , with our @xmath3 values are larger , on average , than caon fits .",
    "interior fits are probably superior for the pp and discussions of its meaning with respect to the specific entropy of an elliptical ( the entropic plane , lima neto 1999 ) since the interior shape of an elliptical more closely reflects the majority of the gravitational potential . in addition , the original motivation for the pp was the strong correlation between galaxy velocity dispersion and @xmath3 . our use of @xmath3 as an outer profile shape parameter decouples that strong relationship , and makes the pp less useful as the outer regions are strongly influenced by post - formation processes .",
    "despite the differences in the @xmath3 values , the pp in figure [ photo_plane ] displays a fair correlation .",
    "errors in @xmath9 and @xmath10 track along the correlation , but most of the error budget is tied to the uncertainties in @xmath3 .",
    "typical 3@xmath41 fit ranges are 0.14 in log @xmath9 , 0.5 in @xmath10 and 0.1 in log @xmath3 .",
    "this results in an uncertainty in the log @xmath3 + @xmath42 axis of approximately 0.2 , which would explain most of the scatter in figure [ photo_plane ] .",
    "as the near - ir bands quickly redshift out of the observational windows , the near - ir pp is probably not as useful as a distance indicator as the optically determined version .",
    "the goal of structural analysis of ellipticals is to search for various scaling relations ( graham 2011 ) that serve to outline a uniform sequence of structural and luminosity ( stellar mass ) properties that ultimately demonstrate structural homology and might be predicted by galaxy formation models . before beginning this analysis ,",
    "it should be noted that the sample used in this study only outlines the upper end of the luminosity function of ellipticals , those ellipticals brighter than @xmath1718 @xmath43 mag ( @xmath1721.5 @xmath13 mag ) .",
    "only 7% of our sample is faint enough to be classified as a low mass or dwarf elliptical .",
    "thus , many of the issues outlined by kormendy ( 2009 ) and graham ( 2011 ) concerning the dichotomy of bright and faint ellipticals are not addressed by our sample .",
    "perhaps the simplest structural parameters are the total luminosity ( a proxy for total stellar mass ) and total galaxy size . whereas our technique to use asymptotic functions , guided by a galaxies surface brightness profile , produces highly reliable total magnitudes , this technique does not lead to accurate total radii .",
    "this is easy to see in the sense that small errors in the outer profile will not significantly alter the luminosity ( as the light levels are lowest ) .",
    "but , since the curve of growth flattens at large radii , small errors in luminosity will lead to large variations where one would define that last isophote .",
    "instead , the half - light radius ( @xmath34 ) was selected because this has a lower uncertainty and it can be compared to the effective radius as defined by the @xmath0 and srsic @xmath1 functions .    the luminosity - radius relation is shown in figure [ half_rad ] , where the top panel displays the empirical half - light radius ( @xmath34 ) which is the point where the integrated light of the elliptical is 1/2 the total luminosity ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the bottom panel displays the total luminosity versus effective radius @xmath9 from srsic @xmath1 model fits .",
    "this diagram is very similar to the original luminosity - radius diagram published in schombert ( 1987 , figure 8) based on @xmath19 photographic photometry . as in the original @xmath19 study ,",
    "the correlation with radius appears to break into two separate relationships for the bright and faint ends at approximate @xmath45 @xmath13 .",
    "the break outlines the conflict between the relationship of @xmath46 , found by strom & strom ( 1978 ) and the shallower relationship of @xmath47 , found by kormendy ( 1977 ) and bernardi ( 2007 ) .",
    "our original study measured the break at @xmath1720.5 in @xmath19 , which corresponds to @xmath1724 @xmath13 in figure [ half_rad ] .",
    "the interpretation of this effect is that bright ellipticals are more extended than their lower luminosity counterparts , and is a prediction of dry merger scenarios ( schombert 1987 ) .",
    "the difference between bright and faint ellipticals is less obvious in the bottom panel , the luminosity versus effective radius ( @xmath9 ) diagram . also shown in that panel is the relationship outlined by graham & guzman ( 2003 ) , corrected for a mean @xmath30 color of 3.5 , a distinctly non - linear relationship that connects bright and dwarf ellipticals .",
    "while the data agrees with the graham & guzman relationship , the scatter is much larger than the luminosity versus half - light radius diagram .",
    "data points farther from the relationship are not poorer fits to the srsic @xmath1 model , so poor fitting does not explain the scatter , but probably reflects the poor match between the srsic @xmath1 model and outer isophotes .    ) and the effective radius ( @xmath9 ) from srsic @xmath1 model fits .",
    "the blue line represents the @xmath47 ( kormendy 1977 , bernardi 2007 ) .",
    "the green line represents @xmath48 ( strom & strom 1978 ) .",
    "the break at @xmath49 was first discovered by schombert ( 1987 ) .",
    "the bottom panel displays luminosity versus effective radius with the red line being the relationship from graham & guzman ( 2003 ) ]    the luminosity versus half - light and effective surface brightness relation is found in figure [ eff_sfb ] . here the half - light surface brightness ( @xmath50 ) is defined as the surface brightness of the galaxy at the half - light radius ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the effective surface brightness ( @xmath10 ) is derived from srsic fits .",
    "there is no expectation that the luminosity - surface brightness relation be linear ( although a linear fit can be made ) , certainly not by an extrapolation of the relationship of dwarf ellipticals ( graham & guzman 2003 ) , whose relationship is shown as the red line in both plots . while both distributions display similar shape , again , the scatter in the empirically determined @xmath50 is less that @xmath10 . and",
    ", again as with the luminosity - radius diagram , there is a break at @xmath51 where the data maintains constant surface brightness for decreasing luminosity .    )",
    "is simply the surface brightness of the galaxy profile at @xmath34 .",
    "the red line is the relationship between luminosity and surface brightness found by graham & guzman ( 2003 ) . ]",
    "the correlation between surface brightness and scale length ( @xmath10 , @xmath34 and @xmath9 ) is shown in figure [ re_se_half ] ( the same as figure [ auto_fit ] for the srsic parameters ) . as with the previous diagrams ,",
    "the scatter is less for the empirically determined half - light radius ( @xmath34 ) , reflecting the added uncertainty induced by fitting functions which are not necessarily an adequate description of the shape of the galaxy s profile .",
    "previous work found this relationship to be linear ( schombert 1987 ) , but extensions to dwarf ellipticals ( graham & guzman 2003 ) finds that the correlation must drop in effective surface brightness at small effective radii in order to make a continuous sequence from bright to faint ellipticals .",
    "as noted by graham ( 2011 ) , the non - linear relations for @xmath10 versus luminosity , and @xmath9 versus luminosity , effectively guarantee that @xmath10 and log @xmath9 will be non - linear as well . the graham & guzman s color corrected relationship for @xmath10 versus @xmath9",
    "is shown in figure [ re_se_half ] and , interestingly , fits the empirical @xmath50 versus @xmath34 better than the srsic parameters . the change from a linear slope at large @xmath9 to a flattening relationship of constant @xmath10 at small @xmath9",
    "is well explained by the graham & guzman curve .",
    "the remaining scaling relations between @xmath44 , @xmath10 , @xmath9 and the concentration index @xmath3 are shown in figure [ full_n ] .",
    "unlike the well defined correlations found by graham & guzman ( 2003 ) ( shown as red lines in the figure ) , the relationship between @xmath3 and the other photometric parameters is practically non - existent . there is a mild trend for increasing @xmath3 with @xmath9 and @xmath10 , but there is no relationship with total luminosity .    the lack of correlations is simply a strong statement on the nature of the @xmath3 index in the context of the procedure for fitting a surface brightness profile",
    ". early work ( trujillo 2001 ) focused on using the @xmath3 index as a measure of the central concentration of a galaxy .",
    "this was achieved by higher resolution imaging of galaxy cores than available from 2mass images , combined with a restriction of using data from the outer isophotes . in addition , the fitting process weights the data by surface brightness , automatically giving inner isophotes greater weight in the fits compared to the outer isophotes ( there are typically more isophotes in the bright regions as well since the typical reduction scheme uses larger and larger apertures in the fainter surface brightness regions ) .     index and @xmath44 , @xmath10 and @xmath9 .",
    "the well defined relationships found by graham & guzman ( 2003 , red curves ) disappear when outer isophotes are used in the fitting process .",
    "there are mild trends of increasing @xmath3 with larger galaxies ( shallower profiles ) , but extracting useful structural information in the halos of elliptical with the srsic @xmath1 model is lost . ]    the wide scatter in figure [ full_n ] underlies the intrinsic problem with the srsic @xmath1 model for describing the halo of a galaxy ( that region beyond the half - light radius ) .",
    "it simply does not have the correct shape to capture the increasing shallow profile slope combined with a sharp cutoff .",
    "a clearer example can be found in figure [ sersic_vs_dev ] . here",
    "the surface brightness profile of ngc 6702 is plotted in @xmath0 space , and was selected for its large dynamic range in surface brightness that appears @xmath0 ( i.e. , srsic @xmath52 ) .",
    "the best @xmath0 ( i.e. , linear ) fit is shown in blue , with a srsic @xmath3 index of 4 by definition . however , the best srsic @xmath1 model fit ( between the two indicated limits ) results in a formal fit @xmath3 index of 6.2 .",
    "the difference between the fits is negligible with very little curvature at the faint and bright ends , yet a formal fit by a srsic @xmath1 model wildly disagrees with a value of @xmath52 , and decouples @xmath9 and @xmath10 from @xmath3 .    in some sense",
    ", the srsic @xmath1 model is too flexible when presented with data with a single power - law slope , but the very shallow @xmath36 contours .",
    "this results in a range of equally valid , but ill - defined fits .",
    "a range of value much larger than the formal errors indicated by the fit algorithm . when a flattened core structure is present , than @xmath3",
    "can become a well - defined measure of concentration , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 parameterize the outer isophotes before the halo is reached .",
    "but , there is simply too much flexibility in the srsic @xmath1 model in the outer regions of galaxies for it to be a unique indicator of structure , even if the model fit itself accurately follows the data .",
    "fit versus srsic fit for ngc 6702 , a nearly perfect @xmath0 shaped profile ( plotted in @xmath0 space for clarity such that the @xmath0 law is a straight line ) .",
    "even when constrained to fit only the middle isophotes ( indicated arrows ) , the srsic @xmath1 model has too much coupling and flexibility to recover a correct profile slope . ]    while it is possible , using the srsic @xmath1 model , to find a set of fit parameters that reproduces a majority of the inner or outer isophotes , the uncertainty in the fit variables , as shown in figure [ chi_grid ] , combined with the inability of the srsic @xmath3 index to simultaneously follow the shape of the inner and outer portions of an ellipticals profile , leads us to conclude that neither the @xmath0 law nor the srsic @xmath1 model are adequate describers of the isophotes of a typical elliptical brighter than @xmath1720 @xmath13 mag .",
    "as once stated by a famous galaxy photometrist , `` it appears all fitting functions are simply elaborate french curves to be inflicted on the data '' ( oemler 1984 ) .",
    "the profiles of ellipticals have always held the greatest promise for exposing underlying structural relations as they are uncluttered by ongoing star formation , dust gas and irregular morphology .",
    "their elliptical isophotes allows for the simplest reduction from 2d images to 1d surface brightness profiles .",
    "the analysis of these profiles has , in past , used various mathematically relations ( fitting functions ) that , hopefully , would have some analytic connection to underlying kinematics or , at least , match predicted profiles from galaxy formation simulations .    in this work , using a large , uniform sample of ellipticals imaging in the near - ir where the luminosity densities are the highest , the meaning and usefulness of the two most common fitting functions , the @xmath0 law and the srsic @xmath1 model have been examined .",
    "the results are summarized as the following :    \\(1 ) the original discovery by schombert ( 1986 ) is reinforced in that the @xmath0 law only accurately describes the surface brightness profile of an elliptical over a limited range of surface brightness and , in that range , only for galaxies brighter than @xmath53 mag .",
    "the 1/4 power index is an arbitrary for the power index as equally good fits are found for 1/5 or 1/3 .",
    "\\(2 ) with the above restrictions , the relationship between @xmath10 and @xmath9 is well defined across many wavelengths and studies ; however , the correlation is assisted by the strong coupling between the fit parameters which serves to minimize the scatter and distort the true errors .",
    "\\(3 ) the srsic @xmath1 model is a quantitative better fit to elliptical profile , mostly due to its additional free parameter .",
    "however , there is no clear evidence that the shape of the outer isophotes is correlated with the shape of the inner isophotes .",
    "therefore , the @xmath3 value deduced from total profile fits will be heavily influenced by the lower photometric error , and typically more numerous , inner isophote profile points .",
    "\\(4 ) fits made to the inner portion ( inside the half - light radius ) of a profile versus the outer portions ( outside the @xmath0 region ) demonstrate that conflicting @xmath3 values are found .",
    "the @xmath3 values for outer fits are typically factors of two higher than inner fits , reflecting the shallower profiles of the halo regions , and are only weakly correlated with inner shape ( see figure [ inner_outer_scale ] ) .",
    "\\(5 ) structural parameters extracted from the srsic @xmath1 model are reproducible between various studies ; however , again , the meaning of the fit parameters is highly distorted by the lack of uniqueness to the fits due to strong coupling of the fit parameters .",
    "the @xmath54 space for the fit parameters is wide and shallow , effectively allowing small photometric errors to dominate the resulting fit values .",
    "nearly identical fits are found with widely difference fit values ( i.e. , the fits are not unique , see figures [ compare_sersic ] and [ sersic_vs_dev ] ) .",
    "\\(6 ) the srsic @xmath1 model photometric plane ( graham 2002 ) is reproduced in the near - ir and using the @xmath3 fits to the outer isophotes .",
    "it s slope and scatter are nearly identical to previous determinations , even in light of the difficulty in applying the srsic @xmath1 model in a coherent fashion .",
    "its linearity may be a reflection of the limited luminosity range in our sample .",
    "\\(7 ) empirically determined values , such as half - light radius ( @xmath34 ) and surface brightness ( @xmath50 ) are as , if not more , accurate compared to srsic @xmath1 model fit parameters with respect to scaling relations ( luminosity versus @xmath21 or scale length ) .",
    "all the scaling relations from graham & guzman ( 2003 ) are reproduced in the near - ir , with the exception of correlations using the srsic @xmath1 model @xmath3 index .",
    "\\(8 ) while none of the structural relations are linear , the bright end of each sequence ( @xmath55 mag ) are distinct from the fainter galaxies , with a possible signature of mergers in the flattening of the luminosity - radius correlation . for the bright ellipticals , the scaling relations were found to be @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "although these are only approximate power - laws inflicted on a much more complex relationship between structure and luminosity .",
    "if the ultimate goal is to relate some observed analytic function to theoretical galaxy models , then the current suite of fitting functions are inadequate .",
    "as empirically defined parameters appear to have less scatter ( e.g. , figure [ half_rad ] ) , then the best scheme to systematic describe the shape of elliptical profiles is to allow the data to stand for themselves .",
    "in other words , to follow the prescription of schombert ( 1987 ) and build template profiles as a function of elliptical luminosity .",
    "these have the advantage of correctly containing all the curvature in structure that is not captured by a smooth analytic function , yet are more stable than a spline fit in the sense that each template only has one variable , the galaxy luminosity .",
    "this technique will be the focus of our next paper , and the application of this method to discover that ellipticals are composed to two structural families ( distinct from the core / cusp problem ) .",
