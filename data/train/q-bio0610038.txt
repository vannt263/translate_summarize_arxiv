    "<S> we introduce a novel concept , the minimal molecular surface ( mms ) , as a new paradigm for the theoretical modeling of biomolecule - solvent interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> when a less polar macromolecule is immersed in a polar environment , the surface free energy minimization occurs naturally to stabilizes the system , and leads to an mms separating the macromolecule from the solvent . for a given set of atomic constraints ( as obstacles ) , </S>",
    "<S> the mms is defined as one whose mean curvature vanishes away from the obstacles . </S>",
    "<S> an iterative procedure is proposed to compute the mms . </S>",
    "<S> extensive examples are given to validate the proposed algorithm and illustrate the new concept . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the mms provides an indication to dna - binding specificity . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed algorithm represents a major step forward in minimal surface generation .    </S>",
    "<S> the stability and solubility of macromolecules , such as proteins , dnas and rnas , are determined by how their surfaces interact with solvent and/or other surrounding molecules . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the structure and function of macromolecules depend on the features of their molecule - solvent interfaces @xcite . molecular surface was proposed @xcite to describe the interfaces and has been applied to protein folding @xcite , protein - protein interfaces @xcite , protein surface topography @xcite , oral drug absorption classification @xcite , dna binding and bending @xcite , macromolecular docking @xcite , enzyme catalysis @xcite , calculation of solvation energies @xcite , and molecular dynamics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is of paramount importance to the implicit solvent models @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the molecular surface model suffers from it being probe dependent , non - differentiable , and being inconsistent with free energy minimization .    </S>",
    "<S> minimal surfaces are omnipresent in nature . </S>",
    "<S> their study has been a fascinating topic for centuries @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> french geometer , meusnier , constructed the first non - trivial example , the catenoid , a minimal surface that connects two parallel circles , in the 18th century . in 1760 , </S>",
    "<S> lagrange discoved the relation between minimal surfaces and a variational principle , which is still a cornerstone of modern mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> plateau studied minimal surfaces in soap films in the mid - nineteenth century . </S>",
    "<S> in liquid phase , materials of largely different polarizabilities , such as water and oil , do not mix , and the material in smaller quantity forms ellipsoidal drops , whose surfaces are minimal subject to the gravitational constraint . </S>",
    "<S> the self - assembly of minimal cell membrane surfaces in water has been discussed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the schwarz p minimal surface is known to play a role in periodic crystal structures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the formation of @xmath0-sheet structures in proteins is regarded as the result of surface minimization on a catenoid @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a minimal surface metric has been proposed for the structural comparison of proteins @xcite . however , to the best of our knowledge , a natural minimal surface that separates a less polar macromolecule from its polar environment such as the water solvent has not been considered yet . the objective of this report is to introduce the theory of and algorithm to generate minimal molecular surfaces ( mmss ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the surface free energy is proportional to the surface area , a mms contributes to the molecular stability in solvent . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , there must be a mms associated with each stable macromolecule in its polar environment . </S>",
    "<S> although minimal surfaces are often generated by evolving surfaces with predetermined curve boundaries @xcite , there is no algorithm available that generates minimal surfaces with respect to obstacles , such as atoms . here </S>",
    "<S> , we develop such an algorithm based on the theory of differential geometry @xcite .    for a given initial function @xmath1 that characterizes domain encompassing the biomolecule of interest </S>",
    "<S> , we consider an evolution driving by the mean curvature @xmath2 @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a small parameter , @xmath5 is the gram determinant , and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> our procedure involves iterating eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ evolut ] ) until @xmath7 everywhere except for certain protected boundary points where the mean curvatures take constant values . </S>",
    "<S> physically , the vanishing of the mean curvature is a natural consequence of surface free energy minimization . consider the surface free energy of a molecule as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is boundary of the molecule , @xmath10 the energy density and @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the energy minimization via the first variation leads to the euler lagrange equation , @xmath12 where @xmath13 . for a homogeneous surface , @xmath14 , a constant , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ el ] ) leads to the vanishing of the mean curvature @xmath15 .    for a given set of atomic coordinates , we prescribe a step function initial value for @xmath1 , i.e. , a non - zero constant @xmath16 inside a sphere of radius @xmath17 about each atom and zero elsewhere . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , a gaussian initial value can be placed around each atomic center . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath1 is updated in the iteration except for at obstacles , i.e. , a set of boundary points given by the collection of all of the van der waals sphere surfaces or any other desired atomic sphere surfaces . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath18 and @xmath19 can be approximated by any standard numerical methods . for simplicity , we use the standard second order central finite difference . due to the stability concern , we choose @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the smallest grid spacing . </S>",
    "<S> the mms is differentiable , probe independent , and consistent with the surface free energy minimization .    </S>",
    "<S> [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     finally , we employ our mms to study the mechanism of molecular recognition in protein - dna interactions . </S>",
    "<S> nmr and molecular dynamics studies suggest that antennapedia achieves specificity through an ensemble of rapidly fluctuating dna contacts @xcite . while x - ray structure indicates a well - defined set of contacts due to side chains constraints @xcite . in the present work , </S>",
    "<S> we reveal flat contacting interfaces which stabilizing the protein - dna complex . figs . [ fig.9ant2](a ) and [ fig.9ant2](c ) depict the mmss of antennapedia and dna ( pdb i d : 9ant ) , generated by using @xmath22 and @xmath23  . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the binding site of the dna ( middle groove ) has a large facet , which is absent from the top and bottom grooves of the dna . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the mms of the protein exhibits a complimentary facet . for a comparison , </S>",
    "<S> the molecular surfaces ( mss ) generated by using the program msms @xcite with the same set of van der waals radii and a probe radius of 1.5   are depicted in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.9ant2 ] ( b ) and [ fig.9ant2 ] ( d ) . </S>",
    "<S> apparently , it is very difficult to recognize the complementary binding interfaces from mss . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that the mms also better reveals the skeleton of the dna s double helix structure . to quantitate the affinity at the contacting site , we compute the mean distance between the mmss of the protein and dna by using about 7200 surface vertices over the binding domain . a small mean distance of 0.4054    unveils a close contact between two facets . </S>",
    "<S> relatively small standard deviation of 0.3401    indicates the smoothness of the contacting facets . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , inconclusive mean ( 0.8697  )  and standard deviation ( 0.5818  )   were found from the corresponding mss . </S>",
    "<S> this study indicates the great potential of the proposed mms for biomolecular binding sites prediction and recognition .    </S>",
    "<S> we have introduced a novel concept , the minimal molecular surface ( mms ) , for the modeling of biomolecules , based on the speculation of free energy minimization for stabilizing a less polar molecule in a polar solvent . </S>",
    "<S> the mms is probe independent , differentiable , and consistent with surface free energy minimization . </S>",
    "<S> a novel hypersurface approach based on the theory of differential geometry is developed to generate the mmss of arbitrarily complex molecules . </S>",
    "<S> numerical experiments are carried out on few - atom and many - atom systems to demonstrate the proposed method . </S>",
    "<S> it is believed that the proposed mms provides a new paradigm for the studies of surface biology , chemistry and physics , in particular , for the analysis of stability , solubility , solvation energy , and interaction of macromolecules , such as proteins , membranes , dnas and rnas . </S>",
