    "the geometrical entanglement ( ge ) is a measure of the multipartite entanglement in a wave - function , and quantifies the distance to the closest _ untangled _ ( separable ) state.@xcite starting from a wave - function @xmath0 for a quantum lattice model with @xmath1 sites , one defines a maximal overlap @xmath2 to be @xmath3 where the maximization is carried on states @xmath4 which are tensor products of single - site states : @xmath5 the larger @xmath6 , the closest it is to a product state , and the less entangled @xmath0 is .",
    "the ge is then defined as@xcite @xmath7 this quantity allows to quantify the global multipartite entanglement of the wave function @xmath0 , and is useful in the context of quantum computation  @xcite or state discrimination with local measurements  @xcite .",
    "the ge has also recently gained interest in many - body and condensed - matter physics  @xcite .",
    "since it generally scales linearly with the volume ( @xmath1 ) of the system one also defines the ge per site : @xmath8 as an example of interesting application , it has been shown that derivatives of @xmath9 on large systems can be used to detect quantum phase transitions.@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the case of the ground - state @xmath10 of the hamiltonian of a periodic spin-1/2 xxz chain : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the number of sites .",
    "we consider the anisotropy parameter in the range @xmath13 , so that the system is gapless ( critical ) . in ref .",
    "it was show numerically that the ge per spin admits the following asymptotic expansion : @xmath14    the purpose of this paper is to show that the term @xmath15 appearing in this expansion can be computed analytically in a simple way . using results of boundary conformal field theory ( cft )  @xcite",
    ", we relate it to an affleck - ludwig ( al ) boundary entropy.@xcite",
    "the product state @xmath16 that maximizes the overlap in eq .",
    "[ eq : overlap ] with the ground - state of eq .",
    "[ eq : h ] is known to be a spin configuration where all spins are parallel @xcite and lie in the @xmath17 plane : @xmath18 computing @xmath15 amounts to calculating a subleading contribution to the scalar product @xmath19 . to do this ,",
    "we adopt a transfer matrix point of view where @xmath20 is interpreted as the dominant eigenstate of the transfer matrix @xmath21 of some two - dimensional classical system ( 6-vertex like in our case ) .",
    "the classical model is defined on a cylinder of circumference @xmath22 and height @xmath23 , with free boundary conditions for the spins ( or the 6-vertex arrows ) at both edges . in this geometry",
    "the free energy @xmath24 can be written@xcite as @xmath25 , with @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 is the boundary free energy per unit length , and @xmath29 is a subleading term in the boundary free energy .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath30 in the limit @xmath23 where only the state @xmath20 contributes .",
    "so , @xmath15 is simply related to the constant @xmath29 in the boundary free energy : @xmath31    for critical systems @xmath29 is universal and may therefore be computed in the continuum limit . in the xxz chain",
    "( equivalently 6-vertex case ) , it corresponds to a compactified free field with the following ( euclidian ) lagrangian density : @xmath32 the compactification radius @xmath33 is related to the decay exponents of the correlation functions and to the luttinger parameter . in the case of eq .",
    "[ eq : h ] , @xmath33 is a known function of @xmath34:@xcite @xmath35 as well - known in boundary cft@xcite , free boundary condition for the spins ( or arrows ) are encoded in the continuum limit by a neumann boundary condition for the free field .",
    "so , the boundary entropy @xmath29 is in fact the al@xcite boundary entropy @xmath36 associated to neumann boundary condition .",
    "its value is known@xcite and depends solely on the compactification radius : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the so - called `` universal non - integer ground - state degeneracy'',@xcite or `` @xmath39-factor '' . combining this with eq .",
    "[ eq : bs ] , our prediction for @xmath15 is : @xmath40    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ge ] , this result matches very well the numerical data of ref .  .",
    "the slight discrepancy for small @xmath34 is likely due to finite - size effects and/or finite - bond dimension errors in the matrix - product representation of the ground - state .",
    "this can be confirmed by an exact microscopic calculation@xcite of @xmath15 at the free fermion point @xmath41 .",
    "the free fermion representation of the chain at @xmath41 allows to obtain@xcite @xmath42 on the lattice , as done in ref .",
    ": @xmath43 from this one gets the expansion in powers of @xmath44 using the euler - maclaurin formula.@xcite the result is : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is catalan s constant .",
    "the result can be compared with the numerical estimations of ref .",
    ": @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "as expected , the exact lattice calculation confirms the field theory prediction at @xmath41 , namely @xmath49 ( eq .",
    "[ eq : b ] ) .",
    "it is also worth noticing that the calculation extends to finite magnetizations of the chain , and simply amounts to move the fermion density away from @xmath50 .",
    "in such a case one observes that @xmath49 is independent of the magnetization .",
    "this again matches the field theory result , since , for @xmath41 , the compactification radius @xmath33 is indeed independent of the magnetization .",
    "the ge for the periodic ising chain in transverse field at the critical point has also been considered numerically in ref .  .",
    "the hamiltonian is now @xmath51 and the product state which maximizes the overlap turns out to be a tilted configuration:@xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the eigenstates of @xmath55.@xcite the authors of ref .",
    "found numerically in this case @xmath56 .",
    "we will now give an argument based on boundary cft , similar to that presented in the case of the xxz chain , which shows that @xmath57 .",
    "again , we wish to interpret the scalar product @xmath6 appearing in the ge as a boundary contribution to a classical two - dimensional free energy . when @xmath20 is the ground state of eq .",
    "[ eq : hising ] , the corresponding classical model is a critical two - dimensional ising model .",
    "if we had to project @xmath20 onto a state where all spins would point in the @xmath58 direction ( corresponding to an angle @xmath59 ) , it would correspond to a fixed ferromagnetic boundary condition for the ising model . on the other hand ,",
    "if we had to project onto a state with all the spins pointing in the @xmath60 direction ( @xmath61 ) , it would correspond to a free boundary condition ( as in the case of the xxz chain ) .",
    "we therefore see that the tilted state of eq .",
    "[ eq : phi_max_ising ] somewhat corresponds to a combination of free and fixed boundary conditions for the classical model .",
    "but the important point is that @xmath62 .",
    "for this reason , @xmath16 breaks the @xmath63 symmetry of the model , which exchanges the @xmath58 and @xmath64 directions .",
    "in such situation , where the boundary condition imposes a non - zero magnetization at the edge , the long - distance and universal properties of the boundary will be equivalent to that of a system with fixed ferromagnetic boundary condition ( all spins pointing in the @xmath58 direction).@xcite in other words , the constant term @xmath29 in the boundary free energy will be the same for the tilted boundary condition and for the ferromagnetic one . in this case , the al entropy @xmath65 is known to be @xmath66 ( corresponding to a @xmath39-factor @xmath67).@xcite as conjectured in ref .  , we therefore obtain @xmath57 .",
    "this argument can also be confirmed using the exact formula of ref .   for the ge , and then applying the euler - maclaurin formula.@xcite",
    "as we have seen in sec .",
    "[ sec : xxz ] , the ge for a critical xxz chain can be expressed using a sum of scalar products with all the spin configurations @xmath68 of the @xmath60-basis : @xmath69 @xmath70 can be seen as a partition function and generalized by introducing a fictitious inverse temperature @xmath71 : @xcite @xmath72 it turns out that @xmath73 is related to rnyi entanglement entropies of a semi - infinite cylinder in some two - dimensional rokhsar - kivelson wave functions , as studied in refs .",
    "( the rnyi parameter being @xmath74 ) .",
    "using numerical and field - theoretical approaches , it was found that @xmath75 scales as @xmath76 , where the constant term @xmath77 is universal and given by @xmath78 so , for the xxz chain , the ge appears to be a special case @xmath79 of this partition function .",
    "we finally comment on the the limit @xmath80 , where only the spin configuration @xmath81 of the @xmath60 basis which have the largest weight in @xmath20 contributes to @xmath73 . for the present xxz chain",
    ", @xmath81 is the ferromagnetic state @xmath82.@xcite taking @xmath80 in eq .",
    "[ eq : z ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : gamma ] we get @xmath83 ( omitting the extensive term ) .",
    "so , we see that the scalar product of @xmath20 with both _ ( i ) _ the uniform configuration where spins point in the @xmath60 direction and _ ( ii ) _ the configuration where spins point in the @xmath58 direction , have very similar subleading terms related to the logarithm of the compactification radius . in the cft language , the former scalar product ( appearing in @xmath84 ) corresponds to a dirichlet boundary condition for the free field , as opposed to neumann for the scalar product appearing in the ge and @xmath85 .",
    "in conclusion , we have related subleading terms of the geometrical entanglement of the critical xxz and ising spin chains to their al boundary entropies , showing that this correction is universal .",
    "whether such universal behaviour in the scaling of the geometrical entanglement ( or of the scalar product of the ground - state with a given separable state in general ) can be found for other physical systems is an open issue that is worth pursuing .",
    "we wish to thank jrome dubail and vincent pasquier for stimulating discussions .",
    "this work is supported by the french anr program anr-08-jcjc-0056 - 01 ( fa ) .                        for introductions on boundary conformal field theory ,",

    "( les houches session lxxxix , 2008 ) ; p. di francesco , p. matthieu , d. snchal _ conformal field theory _",
    "( springer - verlag , 1997 ) .",
    "the main ideas were introduced in ref .  .",
    "for simplicity we only consider the case @xmath87 .",
    "notice that using eq .",
    "[ eq : z ] , this result can also be interpreted ( and recovered ) as the partition function of a discretized gas of particles on an annulus interacting trough a 2d coulomb potential ( discretized dyson gas ) at inverse temperature @xmath79 .",
    "see ref .   for more details .",
    "@xmath88 can easily be deduced from the constant in the asymptotic expansion of @xmath89 $ ] .",
    "then , a way to proceed is to cut the sum in two : @xmath90 . in the first sum",
    ", the tangent can be linearized so as to apply stirling s formula .",
    "the asymptotics of the second sum can be accessed using the euler - maclaurin formula .",
    "the dominant term @xmath91 has been previously computed in ref .  .    introducing @xmath92 , the optimal angle @xmath93 is in the thermodynamic limit solution of @xmath94 j. l. cardy , .",
