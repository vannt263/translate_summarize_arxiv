    "over decades theoretical studies of the single - particle spectral properties of metallic one - dimensional ( 1d ) correlated electron systems  so - called luttinger liquids ( lls)were ahead of the experimental attempts to find or synthesize appropriate quasi 1d materials and perform spectroscopy on them . in fact , while at the begining of the 1990 s a clear picture of the basic spectroscopic properties of translational invariant lls was established ( for reviews see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) this period witnessed the first serious attempts to experimentally verify the specific spectroscopic signatures of lls @xcite .",
    "these are the ( i ) low - energy power - law suppression of the local spectral function @xmath0 for energies @xmath1 close to the chemical potential @xcite with @xmath2 depending on the two - particle interaction as well as ( ii ) the appearance of two dispersing features in the momentum resolved spectral function @xmath3 ( spin - charge separation ) @xcite instead of a single quasi - particle peak of a fermi liquid . for finite temperatures @xmath4 the suppression of the spectral weight as a function of @xmath1",
    "is cut off by @xmath4 and one finds the scaling behavior @xmath5 with a @xmath2-dependent scaling function @xmath6 in which the two energy scales @xmath1 and @xmath4 only enter via their ratio @xcite .",
    "these results were exclusively obtained using bosonization within the tomonaga - luttinger ( tl ) model @xcite .    using the modern language of renormalization group ( rg ) methods the ( translational invariant )",
    "tl model is the exactly solvable effective low - energy fixed point model for a large class of metallic 1d correlated electron systems  the lls @xcite .",
    "it thus plays the same role as the free fermi gas in fermi liquid theory .",
    "the model has two strictly linear branches of right- and left - moving fermions and two - particle scattering is restricted to processes with small momentum transfer @xmath7 , with the fermi momentum @xmath8 .",
    "these processes as well as the kinetic energy can be written as quadratic forms of the densities of right- and left - moving fermions which obey bosonic commutation relations . in most calculations in addition",
    "the momentum dependence of the low - momentum scattering processes @xmath9 and @xmath10 are neglected and momentum integrals are regularized in the ultraviolet introducing a cutoff by hand ( for an exception see ref .",
    "one can extend the resulting _ scale - free , _ field theoretical model by allowing for additional two - particle scattering processes .",
    "these turn out to be rg irrelevant in a wide parameter regime @xcite .",
    "the most important of these processes is the so - called @xmath11-process ( in the g - ology classification @xcite ) with momentum transfer @xmath12 between two scattering fermions of opposite spin .    in some of the early experiments on 1d chains these were obviously interrupted by local impurities @xcite . a simple model of an _ inhomogeneous _ ll is the open boundary analog of the tl model .",
    "interestingly , a ll is very susceptible towards single - particle perturbations with momentum transfer @xmath12 @xcite and on asymptotically low energy scales even a single weak impurity has the same effects on the spectral properties as an open boundary @xcite .",
    "triggered by this theoretical insight and the early experiments , the spectral properties of the open boundary analog of the tl model were studied @xcite .",
    "the local spectral function close to the boundary shows power - law behavior as a function of @xmath1 but with an exponent @xmath13 different from the bulk one @xmath2 . as in the translational invariant case in this model only those low - energy scattering terms",
    "are kept which can be written as quadratic forms in bosonic densities .",
    "only recently it was shown that a large class of further two - particle processes appearing in a 1d system with an open boundary are indeed rg irrelevant @xcite .",
    "the latest scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) and photoemission spectroscopy ( pes ) measurements on different classes of 1d metallic systems @xcite impressively demonstrated that the experiments caught up and more refined questions must now be answered by theory .",
    "important ones are : how do effects which are not captured by the low - energy fixed point model , such as the momentum dependence of the two - particle interaction and the nonlinearity of the single - particle dispersion influence the spectral functions ?",
    "what is the energy scale of a given microscopic model on which the low - energy ll physics sets in ? how do scaling functions for lattice models look like in detail ?",
    "here we shed some light on the last two questions and briefly comment on the first one .",
    "it is widely believed that neglecting the momentum dependence of the interaction and regularizing momentum integrals in the ultraviolet by hand has no effect on the low - energy physics of ll s .",
    "this is indeed correct if all energy scales are sent to zero , that is for @xmath14 and @xmath15 : at small @xmath1 the spectral properties are unaffected by the details of the momentum dependence of the @xmath16 s .",
    "however , if @xmath3 as a function of @xmath1 is studied at fixed @xmath17 , as it is usually done in angular resolved pes , details of the momentum dependence of the interaction matter .",
