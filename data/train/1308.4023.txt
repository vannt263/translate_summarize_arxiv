    "thus , reflection can occur in much softer states in neutron stars , and potentially when winds are important .",

    "based on recent observations of gx  13 + 1 , for instance , @xcite suggest a wind origin for the breadth of iron emission lines in neutron stars as a class . in this work , we critically examine the properties of disk winds and atmospheres , and broad iron emission lines , in three neutron star low - mass x - ray binaries .      to assess whether disk winds are the source of line broadening in neutron star low - mass x - ray binaries we need to consider the observational signatures of such a scenario . as a photon passes through an accretion disk wind or corona , it will be compton scattered , leading to a shift in energy of the photon , and hence a broadening of any emission line feature .",
    "the total number of scatterings determines the overall shift in energy for a given photon .",
    "hence , an increase in the average number of scatterings per photon leads to an increase in the breadth of an emission line .",
    "the number of scatterings is set by both the electron temperature and the optical depth of the wind / corona .",
    "therefore , for a given electron temperature , an increase in the optical depth will correspond to an increase in the width of an emission line .",
    "observationally , then , we could expect to see an increase in the measured emission line width ( @xmath0 ) with an increase in the measured warm absorption column density , when both emission and absorption lines are observed simultaneously .",
    "such a correlation is claimed in gx 13 + 1 by @xcite , and we study this further , below .",
    "@xcite also claim that an increase in the emission line equivalent width with a corresponding increase in the equivalent width of the absorption line ( or similarly the warm absorption column density ) is a signature that the broad line width is determined by scattering .",

    "this can explain some but not all of the change in ew observed in gx 13 + 1 and intrinsic changes must also be involved .",
    "however , it highlights that a correlation between absorption column density or absorption line equivalent width and emission line equivalent width does not imply that the line is broadened by scattering and can arise simply due to the change in continuum caused by a change in absorption .",

    ", we consider whether compton broadening in a disk atmosphere is sufficient to give the broad lines observed in gx  13 + 1 .",
    "we want to consider what are the realistic conditions in the disk atmosphere / corona and what broadening that will lead to .",
    "the change in energy per compton scattering goes like @xmath38 , thus it is important to determine a realistic electron temperature .",
    "one of the most detailed studies of an extended accretion disk corona is that of @xcite who apply detailed photoionization models to a high quality _ chandra _ hetgs spectrum of the neutron star lmxb her  x-1 .",

    "a much more extreme example is the black hole x - ray binary gro  j1655@xmath1140 which showed a powerful outflowing wind .",
    "the electron temperature there is determined to be @xmath43 k @xcite .",
    "if we conservatively assume that @xmath44 is factor of 14 higher than her  x-1 and comparable to the extreme case of gro  j1655@xmath1140 , say @xmath45  kev , then @xmath46 , which for a 6.7 kev emission line is @xmath47 kev per scatter .",
    "we can calculate the optical depth , @xmath48 , of the warm absorber from the column density via @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the thomson cross - section @xmath51 @xmath52 .",
    "the largest warm absorber column density for gx  13 + 1 measured in @xcite is @xmath53 @xmath31 , thus , we get @xmath54 .",
    "the optical depth is therefore not high enough to give enough scatterings to lead to a line as broad as seen in gx  13 + 1 .",
    "recent observations of the neutron star low - mass x - ray binary gx  13 + 1 have been suggested as evidence that the origin of broad emission lines in neutron star low - mass x - ray binaries is due scattering in disk winds @xcite .",
    "here , we have looked at 3 neutron star low - mass x - ray binaries where both a broad iron emission line and absorption lines have been observed simultaneously . if the breadth of the iron emission line is set by scattering in the disk wind or corona , then one should expect a correlation between the width of the emission line and the absorbing column  a larger absorbing column leads to more scattering and hence a broader line .",
    "by comparing these two quantities in three neutron stars we find no statistically significant correlation either globally , or on an individual basis for gx 13 + 1 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the observational evidence does not indicate broadening due to scattering in a disk wind .",
    "one complication that we are not able to test is that a change in electron temperature in the disk wind / corona will change the emission line width  the electron temperature sets the energy shift per scatter .",
    "while we can not account for this in our analysis , we can point to the fact that none of the objects show a significant change in line width between different spectra .",
    "@xcite claim that in gx 13 + 1 an increase in emission line equivalent width is correlated with the absorption line equivalent width and that this implies the broad emission line is due scattering .",
    "firstly , there is no statistically significant correlation between the equivalent widths , or the emission line equivalent width and column density .",
    "furthermore , a correlation between equivalent widths does not necessarily imply line broadening as a change in continuum strength due to absorption can lead to a change in equivalent width , though this depends on the continuum shape and warm absorber parameters .",
    "another insight into the origin of broad iron lines in neutron star low - mass x - ray binaries can be gleaned by considering magnetic field constraints that have recently been achieved in accreting x - ray pulsars .",
    "broad , likely relativistic iron lines in sax j1808.6@xmath113658 @xcite and igr j17480@xmath112446 ( in terzan 5 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have placed limits on the inner radial extent of the accretion disk . in both cases , assuming that the disk is truncated by the stellar magnetic dipole gives a field strength equivalent to estimates based on x - ray timing traces of the inner disk extent .",
    "these examples of correspondence clearly signal that the iron emission line width is driven by dynamics in the inner disk , not by scattering in a distant wind .    further support of reflection in neutron star low - mass x - ray binaries is the correspondence between blackbody flux and fe k emission line flux in 4u 1705@xmath1144 @xcite during the soft state .",
    "this demonstrates that during soft states the blackbody component ( likely associated with the neutron star boundary layer ) can be irradiating the accretion disk leading to reflection .",
    "softer states in neutron star low - mass x - ray binaries do not necessarily have weaker reflection than harder states , and the source of the x - ray irradiation in soft and hard states is likely different @xcite .",
    "another point of comparison is the so - called `` accretion disk corona '' sources , wherein the line of sight is thought to more persistently intercept the disk atmosphere .",
    "a good example may be 2s  0921@xmath1163 as observed with the _ chandra_/hetgs .",
    "the spectrum is extremely hard ( @xmath55 ) , and thus likely the result of scattering rather than direct emission .",
    "a number of emission lines are observed , including fe k , with a measured width of @xmath56  kev @xcite .",
    "of course , this line is far narrower than any that would be plausibly associated with the inner disk , but it is consistent with theoretical treatments of disk atmospheres ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * see below )",
    ".    her x-1 may be another relevant example to consider in this context .",
    "the disk corona in this system has been studied extensively using gratings x - ray spectroscopy , and detailed analysis has succeeded in even constraining the electron number density of the gas @xcite . in the  low \"",
    "state observed using the _ chandra_/hetgs , for instance , neutral , he - like , and h - like lines are detected .",
    "each line has a width less than @xmath57 ( or @xmath58  kev ; * ? ? ?",
    "as we show here , even an electron density of more than 10 times that seen in her  x-1 is not high enough to give sufficient compton broadening to match the fe k emission line width in gx 13 + 1 given the observed warm absorber column densities .",
    "last , if a dense wind is the fundamental requirement for the production of broad iron lines , then such lines should also be detected in the spectra of high - mass x - ray binaries . @xcite",
    "present a detailed study of the neutron star hmxb gx 301@xmath112 .",
    "the absorber is found to approach @xmath59 , but the width of the iron emission line is just @xmath0 = 0.030.04  kev .",
    "similarly , the fe k@xmath35 lines in hmxbs studied by @xcite are also very narrow ( unresolved by _",
    "chandra _ ) .",
    "thus , both theoretical treatments of disk atmospheres and observations of accretion disk corona sources show that narrow , not broad , lines originate there .    in conclusion , we do not find any significant correlation between broad iron line width and the column density of warm absorbers in neutron star low - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "thus , we do not currently find any observational evidence pointing toward line broadening due to a disk wind .",
    "further observations and detailed photoionization modeling of neutron star lmxbs displaying absorption is needed to further test the disk wind scenario for iron line broadening ."
