    "the implementation of quantum algorithms using nmr on molecules in liquid@xcite , solid@xcite , and liquid crystals@xcite has demonstrated _ in principle _ that pulse - based control methods can be useful for quantum information processing@xcite ( qip ) .",
    "the technique has long been a staple in nmr spectroscopy , where complex molecules like proteins are analyzed with the help of long sequences of precisely designed radiofrequency pulses@xcite .",
    "related techniques for coherent manipulation of many - body quantum systems have emerged as an important tool in many areas of science and technology .",
    "a useful quantum computer should contain hundreds , if not thousands of qubits .",
    "the only hope of scaling to such system sizes is with the help of multiple levels of quantum error correction ( qec ) . for this to work",
    ", the benefits due to each additional level of encoding should outweigh the corresponding overhead of additional errors .",
    "this leads to various threshold theorems@xcite , estimating the maximum error rate for which such concatenated encoding can be beneficial .",
    "the corresponding thresholds are rather stringent , meaning that for scalability one needs very accurate elementary gates .",
    "even for relatively small @xmath0-body systems , the number of states scales exponentially with @xmath0 , and the accuracy required for qip is high . as demonstrated in several recent experiments in nmr qip ,",
    "required accuracy can be reached with the help of _ strongly - modulating pulses _ , where entire single- or few - qubit gates are designed numerically for a given molecule@xcite [ also see ] .",
    "while the technique indeed offers unprecedentedly accurate , fast gates ( which also helps to avoid relaxation ) , it obviously can not be generalized to larger systems .",
    "in contrast , the traditional pulse and sequence design rely on the magnus ( cumulant ) expansion@xcite .",
    "the expansion is done around the evolution in the applied controlling fields , while the chemical shifts@xcite ( resonant - frequency offsets ) and inter - qubit couplings are treated perturbatively .",
    "the main advantage of the magnus expansion is its locality .",
    "namely , when local qubit couplings are dominant , the control fields accurate to a given order can be designed by analyzing relatively small clusters .",
    "the results remain exact independent of the system size , or even in the limit of infinite system .",
    "one can thus characterize pulse - based method for designing control fields as _",
    "scalable _ to large system sizes . @xcite .",
    "a scheme to systematically construct high - order self - refocusing pulses and pulse sequences was developed by the authors in ref .  .",
    "specifically , we constructed `` soft '' nmr - style@xcite second - order self - refocusing inversion ( @xmath1 ) pulses and several high - order sequences based on such pulses for refocusing qubits arranged in spin chains with on - site chemical shifts and xxz nearest - neighbor coupling . the main technical advance which enabled the calculations@xcite was the efficient numerical algorithm for computing high - order terms of the magnus expansion .",
    "the algorithm is based on the usual time - dependent perturbation theory ; the direct computation of multiple integrals entering higher - order cumulants would be totally impossible .",
    "in this paper we present highly - optimized self - refocusing pulse shapes for rotation angles @xmath2 other than 180@xmath3 . for such pulses , we extend the results of ref .   and construct the analytical expansion of the evolution operator for an arbitrary coupled qubit . while the expansion is more complicated than that for the inversion pulses with @xmath4 , to second order , it is still characterized by only three coefficients , two of which we suppress by pulse shaping .",
    "this allows us to compute the error operators associated with a given control sequence semi - analytically , by evaluating the leading order terms in the corresponding products of the evolution operators .",
    "we illustrate the technique on several newly - constructed decoupling sequences for a chain of qubits with on - site and nearest - neighbor couplings , as well as with the composite pulses protecting against amplitude errors .",
    "in principle , the simplest type of control pulses consist of short , intense bursts of coherent , resonant electromagnetic radiation , popularly known as `` hard '' or `` bang - bang '' pulses . in this limit , for the duration @xmath5 of the pulse one can totally ignore all other couplings of the qubit(s ) .",
    "then , a pulse sequence can be viewed as a series of free evolution intervals [ unitary evolution operators @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the system hamiltonian ] intercalated with pulse operators .",
    "for example , with single - qubit control hamiltonian , @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 are the pauli matrices for @xmath11-th qubit and @xmath12 are the corresponding control fields ( or , more precisely , the envelopes of the control fields applied at the resonant frequency of the corresponding qubit ) , the pulse operator is the product of those for individual qubits , @xmath13 , @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the unit vector that determines the spin rotation axis and @xmath2 is the corresponding angle , @xmath16    the corresponding pulse algebra is straightforward .",
    "for example , for a single spin with the chemical shift hamiltonian , @xmath17 the sequence of two equally - spaced inversion pulses ( @xmath18 ) in @xmath19-direction is equivalent to a unitary , @xmath20 which is , of course , the formal identity behind the well - known spin - echo sequence@xcite .    in reality , the pulse duration @xmath5 is always finite .",
    "thus , during the pulse application , the rotation actually happens around the axis determined by the sum of the system and control hamiltonians ; one gets finite - pulse - duration errors .",
    "generically , such errors scale _ linearly _ with pulse duration .",
    "these errors are especially dangerous in systems where one can not reduce the pulse duration indefinitely , e.g. , because of the need for spectral addressing in homonuclear nmr , or in order to avoid exciting levels outside the qubit state in josephson phase qubits@xcite . yet , even in systems with optical qubit coupling where @xmath5 could be in the sub - picosecond range",
    ", the finite - pulse - duration errors can be significant if one targets the accuracy necessary for achieving the scalability thresholds@xcite .",
    "the finite - pulse - duration errors can be significantly reduced by suppressing the leading - order error operators .",
    "the errors would scale with a higher power of the pulse duration , which makes them much more manageable .",
    "this can be achieved either by designing special sequences ( which typically doubles or quadruples the number of pulses ) , or by using specially designed self - refocusing pulse shapes@xcite .",
    "typically , the latter strategy is more efficient@xcite ; besides , the self - refocusing pulses can often be used as drop - in replacements for corresponding @xmath21-pulses@xcite .",
    "we consider the following simplified hamiltonian @xmath22 with the first ( main ) term due to individual control fields , @xmath23 , \\ ] ] where @xmath24 , @xmath10 , are the usual pauli matrices for the @xmath0-th qubit ( spin ) of the 1d chain .",
    "the other terms include the native hamiltonian of the system @xmath25 describing the constant qubit couplings and the interactions between the qubits , and the coupling with the oscillator thermal bath , @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham - env ] ) , @xmath27 account for the possibility of a direct coupling of the controlling fields @xmath28 with the bath variables @xmath29 , @xmath30 , while @xmath31 describe the usual coupling of the spins with the oscillator bath . already in the linear response approximation ,",
    "the bath couplings  ( [ eq : ham - env ] ) produce a frequency - dependent renormalization of the control hamiltonian @xmath32 [ eq .  ( [ eq : ham - control ] ) ] , as well as the thermal bath heating via the dissipative part of the corresponding response function .",
    "both effects become more of a problem with increased spectral width of the controlling signals @xmath28 . in this work",
    "we do not specify the explicit form of the coupling @xmath33 .",
    "instead , we minimize the spectral width of the constructed pulses .    while the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : native - ham ] ) is a generic spin hamiltonian",

    ", any desired unitary transformation can only be implemented approximately .",
    "a widely used framework to design pulses to effect a desired unitary transformation ( or , equivalently , remove the effect of undesired terms in the hamiltonian ) is the magnus@xcite expansion and the average hamiltonian theory@xcite .",
    "the expansion is done with respect to the evolution due to the control fields alone , @xmath39 by defining the system hamiltonian in the interaction representation ( the `` rotating - frame hamiltonian '' ) , @xmath40 for a periodic control field , @xmath41 , such that the zeroth - order driven evolution is also periodic , @xmath42 , one has the following expansion in powers of @xmath43 : @xmath44 where @xmath45,\\\\    \\label{eq : avham - two }    { \\bar h}^{(2)}\\tau_c & = & -{1\\over 6}\\int_0^{\\tau_c}dt_3     \\int_0^{t_3}dt_2\\int_0^{t_2}dt_1   \\\\     & & \\times \\left([{\\tilde h}_3,[{\\tilde            h}_2,{\\tilde h}_1]]+      [ { \\tilde h}_1,[{\\tilde h}_2,{\\tilde h}_3]]\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] generally , the term @xmath46 contains a @xmath47-fold integration of the commutators of the rotating - frame hamiltonian @xmath48 at different time moments @xmath49 and scales as @xmath50 .",
    "note that for small enough @xmath43 , the expansion parameter remains small even for long evolution time .",
    "the magnus expansion thus offers a basis for constructing successful approximations towards the desired unitary evolution . with the simpler problem of decoupling",
    ", the goal is to have no evolution .",
    "a @xmath51-th order refocusing sequence can be defined as that where there is no evolution to @xmath51-th order , that is , @xmath52 respectively , at time @xmath53 , the error in the unitary evolution operator would scale as @xmath54 , and the corresponding fidelity @xmath55 differs from unity by @xmath56 a crucial advantage of the cumulant expansion is that the cumulants do not contain the disconnected terms arising from different parts of the system ( cluster theorem@xcite ) . for an arbitrary lattice model of the form ( [ eq : ham - xxz ] ) , with bonds representing the qubit interactions , the terms contributing to @xmath47-th order can be represented graphically as connected clusters involving up to @xmath47 lattice bonds ; for a chain of qubit such clusters can not have more than @xmath57 vertices .",
    "thus , to obtain the exact form of the expansion up to and including @xmath51-th order , one needs to analyze all distinct chain clusters with up to @xmath58 vertices .      while the magnus expansion is conceptually straightforward , it is cumbersome to implement and , most importantly , the repeated integrations are very expensive computationally already at the second order , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : avham - one ] ) . an alternative strategy for evaluating high - order terms of the magnus expansion",
    "was suggested by the present authors in ref .  . instead of working with the cumulants ,",

    "these should be compared with @xmath94 and @xmath204 respectively for the regular 8-pulse sequence [ tab .",
    "[ tab : decoup - order ] ] .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:8_bb1](a ) that regular 1st- and 2nd - order pulses @xmath205 and @xmath206 perform in the bb@xmath148-corrected composite sequence almost as well as the self - refocusing pulses with additional amplitude protection ( 1st - order @xmath207 and 2nd - order @xmath208 ) . in addition",
    ", the 2nd - order pulses with amplitude protection ( @xmath208 ) work almost as well in the regular 8-pulse sequence .",
    "all of these allow to achieve the infidelity level of @xmath195 at amplitude mismatch of @xmath209 or higher ( up to @xmath210 with pulses @xmath208 in the sequence * * 8**bb@xmath148 ) . with the regular 8-pulse sequence ,",
    "the region of high fidelity shrinks substantially for pulses @xmath206 and @xmath207 , and it all but disappears for the pulse s@xmath148 [ the coefficient @xmath173 for the pulse @xmath207 happens to be a few times smaller than that for @xmath205 ] .",
    "the results of analogous calculation for a particular 4-qubit xxz chain with on - site chemical potential shifts @xmath192 over time interval @xmath193 ( exactly the same parameters as in figs .",
    "[ fig : samples ] , [ fig : size ] ) are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:8_bb1](b ) .",
    "however , it turns out that the bb@xmath148 composite pulses lose accuracy when used with xxz chain . even in the absence of amplitude errors , there are linear errors in @xmath212 [ the zeroth order average hamiltonian is non - zero ] .",
    "thus , we only present the results for the regular 8-pulse sequence . with this sequence , the decoupling orders for 1st- and 2nd - order pulses are @xmath94 and @xmath97 respectively [ tab .",
    "[ tab : decoup - order ] ] . compared with ising - only couplings , with the particular parameters chosen ,",
    "this increases the infidelity by some five orders of magnitude with pulses q@xmath148 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : samples](c ) ] , and by some two orders of magnitude for pulses @xmath205 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : samples](b ) ] . as for the ising chain ,",
    "the effect of the amplitude errors is weaker with specially - designed pulses @xmath207 and @xmath208 such that the 1st - order coefficient @xmath213 scales as a higher power of @xmath119 . with the pulse @xmath207 ,",
    "the 2nd - order coefficient @xmath173 is non - zero but small ; it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:8_bb1](b ) that its effect is to introduce a linear term @xmath214 which tends to skew the infidelity minimum away from @xmath161 .",
    "we should also note that with the gaussian pulses g@xmath215 ( not shown ) , even the on - resonance infidelity is out of range of the plots fig .  [ fig:8_bb1 ] .",
    "( a)=0.75 ( b)=0.75",
    "we presented a comprehensive study targeting pulse and sequence design and analysis based on a consistent high - order average hamiltonian expansion .",
    "the numerical technique for expanding the evolution operator was originally introduced by us in ref .  , and a complimentary analytical technique was developed for @xmath1-pulses by one of the authors in ref .  .",
    "the overall approach is to start with a closed system described by a finite - dimensional hamiltonian @xmath7 and design a sequence of shaped pulses such that the evolution operator would be accurate to a given order @xmath51 in powers of @xmath7 .",
    "the key to this approach are the nmr - style 1st- and 2nd - order self - refocusing one - dimensional pulses constructed for a single - qubit chemical - shift hamiltonian  ( [ eq : chemical - shift ] ) . in this work we designed a number of such shapes for different rotation angles @xmath2 , and presented a careful analytical analysis of the first two leading orders of the average hamiltonian theory for driven qubit evolution with the most general system hamiltonian @xmath7 .",
    "while any symmetric one - dimensional pulse shape is characterized by only three parameters , two of these can be set to zero by pulse shaping .",
    "the remaining parameter is also non - zero for an ideal `` hard '' @xmath21-function pulse .",
    "this leads to an important conclusion that the constructed pulses can be used as drop - in replacement for hard pulses ; with proper pulse placement the results should be identical to first two orders . the structure of errors appearing in higher orders of the evolution operator can be understood by analyzing the numerical time - dependent perturbation series for the evolution operator of a closed system .",
    "an important advantage of this approach is that the expansion order offers a natural classification of the error operators . as a result , ( * i * ) the convergence regions have regular shapes as a function of parameters [ see figs .  [",
    "fig : bb1-clj](c , d ) and [ fig : bb1-wp](b , c ) ] .",
    "furthermore , with local two- ( or few-)qubit couplings dominant , ( * ii * ) the error operators can be placed on connected clusters of up to @xmath216 qubits for terms of order @xmath47 , which allows one to understand their structure in terms , e.g. , the direct products of up to @xmath217 pauli matrices .",
    "once their structure understood , the convergence can be readily improved by suppressing the error operators , as in our analysis of pulse - amplitude errors .",
    "we emphasize , that such an analysis can be performed even for very large qubit systems .",
    "thus , ( * iii * ) this approach is characterized by scalability with the system size , as we illustrated by analyzing decoupling infidelity with the system size [ fig .",
    "[ fig : size ] ] .",
    "although in this work we concentrated on the dynamics of closed systems , another important advantage is that ( * iv * ) the high - order control sequences result in lower decoherence in the presence of slow environmental modes@xcite .",
    "most obvious application of highly - optimized shaped pulses of the sort presented in this work is in solid - state quantum computation , where the bandwidth available for quantum gates is typically limited .",
    "our techniques based on analytical and numerical high - order average hamiltonian theory offers a systematic scalable approach for constructing gates for such multi - qubit systems , without need of solving their full dynamics .",
    "however , even if the bandwidth does not appear to be at premium , simple pulse shaping ( e.g. , using 1st - order pulses ) can still offer a substantial improvement of control accuracy .",
