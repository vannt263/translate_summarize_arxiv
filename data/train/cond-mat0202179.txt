    "the acoustic phonon scattering of electrons in two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems in quantizing magnetic fields has been extensively studied for the last three decades .",
    "the peculiar density of states of the 2d electrons in a transversal magnetic field @xmath1 produces a suppresion of the electron - phonon stattering rate at strong magnetic fields  @xcite , at which the so called _ inelasticity _ parameter @xmath2 is less than unity , here @xmath3 is the sound velocity , @xmath4 is the magnetic length , and @xmath5 is the cyclotron frequency .",
    "a detailed analysis of the acoustic phonon emission and absorption spectra in 2d electron systems has been carried out in connection with developing a phonon absorption spectroscopy  @xcite , which is used to investigate the states of electronic matter in both integer and fractional quantum hall effects .",
    "it was also noticed that , at a certain stage of supression of the one - phonon inter - landau - level transition , the two - phonon transition dominates the electron relaxation rate  @xcite",
    ". however , in a two - subband system , the electron relaxation rate can still be due to the one - phonon transitions occurring between landau levels of different size - quantization subbands .",
    "an oscillatory behavior of the electron lifetime was found in a two - subband system  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on an intersection of two landau levels belonging to different size - quantization subbands of a two - dimensional electron gas in a transversal magnetic field @xmath1 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the electron density is chosen so that there are enough electrons to fill only one landau level out of the two at the intersection point . despite the general suppression due to small @xmath6",
    ", we find that , at an energy separation between the two landau levels of the order of the characteristic acoustic - phonon energy @xmath7 , the electron - phonon scattering is significantly enhanced . in what follows , we neglect the effects related to the coulomb interaction between the electrons .",
    "these effects change significantly the results at low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "the virtue of the considered structure , from the point of view of electron - phonon scattering , is that an enhancement of the dissipative conductivity @xmath0 arises on the background of its strong overall suppression .",
    "this enhancement can be understood from the following physical consideration .    at the intersection of two landau levels , say level @xmath8 of the upper subband and level @xmath9 of the lower subband , the matrix element of the electron - phonon interaction requires a phonon momentum @xmath10 for the most efficient transition .",
    "note that two landau levels can be intersected at a magnitude of @xmath1 corresponding to @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the characteristic width of the quantum well confining the two - dimensional electron gas .",
    "this results in @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the perpendicular and in - plane components of the phonon momentum , respectively . on the other hand",
    ", the energy conservation law requires that the phonon energy @xmath16 matches the energy separation between the two landau levels @xmath17 . for acoustic phonons , we have @xmath18 , and if combined with the momentum requirement , two _ resonances _ are obtained , one on each side of the crossing point , corresponding to @xmath19 . at each resonance the electron - phonon scattering is significantly enhanced , owing to the one - phonon transitions .",
    "it is worth noting that a simultaneous intersection of two landau levels with the fermi level leads to a missing quantum hall effect plateau as expected from a single - subband consideration .",
    "such intersections occur repeatedly with decreasing @xmath1 , if the electron density per spin orientation @xmath20 , where @xmath21 , @xmath22 are natural numbers , and @xmath23 , with @xmath24 being the energy separation between the two size - quantization subbands . however , if the coulomb interaction between the electrons is taken into account , a _",
    "new _ energy gap emerges at the intersection point  @xcite .",
    "an enhancement of the electron scattering in a two - subband system occurs also at zero magnetic field , when the second size - quantization subband starts being filled with electrons .",
    "this effect can be viewed in terms of a lifshitz topological transition of the fermi surface , which is well known for the 3d case  @xcite .",
    "the 2d case of this transition was considered in ref .",
    ", where the electron scattering occured on a random potential of impurities . at @xmath25 , one can hardly speak of a fermi surface . however",
    ", we refer the peculiar behaviour of @xmath0 in our case to the same origin  a strong variation in the density of states at the fermi level .",
    "the case considered in this paper has the advantage of more pronunced anomalies .",
    "an experimental realization of the above described situation can be acheived in gaas / algaas heterojunctions .",
    "usually , the donor supply of the electrons into the 2d layer is not sufficient to achieve filling of the second size - quantization subband .",
    "however , a significant increase in the concentration can be achieved by illuminating the sample with photons of energy close to the band gap of gaas .",
    "the photoexcited electrons come either from the dx centers in the algaas layer  @xcite or from the valence band of the bulk gaas producing a charge separation at the interface  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the 2d electron concentration can be tuned within a large range using the method of continuous photoexcitation  @xcite .",
    "population of the second subband of size quantisation in a magnetic field has been observed in a number of experiments related to magneto - optical studies of the integer and fractional quantum hall effects  @xcite@xmath26@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider only scattering of electrons by phonons , although in a real 2d system the main contribution into @xmath0 at low temperatures comes from the scattering of electrons by the impurity potential .",
    "this was extensively studied in connection with the integer quantum hall effect . however , since the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath27 , the phonon - induced @xmath0 , at high enough magnetic fields , may be comparable with the impurity induced @xmath0 .",

    "the acoustic phonons , with dispersion @xmath35 , interact with the electrons via both deformation potential ( dp ) and piezoelectric ( pe ) mechanisms .",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to the isotropic debye approximation in which the phonon modes fall into a branch of longitudinal ( la ) phonons ( @xmath36 ) and two branches of transversal ( ta ) phonons ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "this seems to be a good approximation for phonons at thermal equilibrium , in contrast with the case of balistic phonon propagation , where the anysotropy gives rise to self - focusing effects  @xcite . for gaas",
    ", it follows that the dp mechanism couples electrons only with la phonons .",
    "we assume that acoustic phonons are the only sourse of scattering for the electrons in the well , neglecting the effects of interface roughness and random potential of impurities , as well as the presence of optical phonon modes .",
    "this assumption is valid for fairly pure samples at temperatures below the optical phonon energy .",
    "we also suppose the acoustical phonons to be three dimentional , neglecting the effects of interface phonons .",
    "the electrons are considered spinless .",
    "the spin degeneracy can be easily accounted for at the final stage of calculation .",
    "electron scattering by phonons is spin preserving , and the results for the conductivity will differ only by a factor of 2 .    the system of interacting electron and phonon gases is described by the following second quantized hamiltonian @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 here @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , @xmath44 stand for the creation and annihilation operators of the electron and phonon respectively .",

    "it is well known that , in the general case , taking into account of a perturbation has two effects on a electron gass .",

    "we will focus here on the energy renormalisation effects in a special case when two landau levels of different subbands of size quantisation have approached each other at an energy distance comparable to the characteristic phonon energy .",

    "formula ( [ eq:31 ] ) has the following physical interpretation .",
    "the electron can be scattered from the lower ( upper ) in energy landau level onto the other one by absorbing ( emitting ) a phonon .",
    "each of these processes leads to the diffusion of the electron within these two landau levels .",
    "thus , one can think of the diffusion of the electron in the upper level induced by the emission of a phonon , and of the diffusion of the electron in the lower level induced by the absorption of a phonon . at thermal equlibrium",
    "the number of electrons transfered up and down is equal , which mathematically is related by the identity , @xmath174 where @xmath175 .",
    "threfore , it is not important that at each scattering event the electron is transfered from one landau level onto the other . in a diffusive motion the `` memory '' after one scattering event is lost .",
    "thus , one can safely assign to each landau level a diffusion coefficient and disregard the conservation of the number of electrons during inelastic processes . this way we interpret formula ( [ eq:31 ] ) as a generalised einschtein relation , @xmath176",
