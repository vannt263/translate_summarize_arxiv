    "the potential model description in the nonperturbative regime of qcd is tremendously successful in providing both qualitative and quantitative description of the hadron spectrum and the deacy modes.on this basis , we have pursued a non relativisic constituent quark model ( nrqm)[1 - 4 ] for mesons containing a heavy ( light ) quark and a light(heavy ) antiquark .although non relativistic in nature , relativistic effect is to be introduced from outside [ 5,6 ] due to the light quarks involved.basically , the model relies on the work of rujula , georgi and glashow [ 7 ] who used a nonrelativistic treatment of potential model which was quite successful in the description of different hadronic properties.we have solved the schrdinger equation for the spin independent fermi - breit hamiltonian ( used in the work of rujula et al [ 7 ] ) consisting of the linear cum coulombic potential for the ground state [ 2].the solution i.e. wavefunction has been obtained using different approximation methods like dalgarno method [ 8 ] and variationally improved perturbation theory(vipt ) [ 9 - 11 ] which is then used in predicting the isgur - wise ( i - w)function [ 2,3,4,12,13],mass , decay constant , charge radii[1 ] etc.we note that with the linear cum coulomb potential of qcd we have two options in choosing parent or child(i.e.perturbation)-(i)first , we can consider the linear one as the perturbation ( i.e.the coulombic one as the parent ) and then ( ii)coulombic one as the perturbation ( i.e. linear one as the parent).as we have already successfully used vipt for both the options in the calculation of slope and curvature of i - w function for @xmath0 and @xmath3 mesons [ 12,13],so extending it for the prediction of elastic form factors and charge radii ( which provide important insight on the distribution of different charge constituents of a hadron ) definitely makes a sense .",
    "it is well known that the form factor and charge radius are dependent on the momentum transform of the wavefunction.so,getting an appropriate wavefunction is very essential for a fruitful analysis.with the success of vipt in the calculation of isgur - wise function as pointed above [ 12,13],one can expect a similar success here also .it is worthwhile to note that while investigating the form factor , one must take into account of a proper range of four momentum transfer @xmath2.the @xmath2 range usually determines the applicability of perturbative qcd(pqcd ) or nonperturbative(npqcd).so , an accurate selection of @xmath2 range within the nonperturbative approach is necessary which will also fall within the experimental regime.this fecilitates a direct comparision between theory and experiment.this has been done both theoretically and experimentally since long [ 14 - 19 ] for the light @xmath4",
    "etc mesons.however,for the mesons which contain atleast one heavy quark , very little have been investigated theoretically [ 20 - 22].in the absence of any experimental data for them , our results may be helpful in future in the experimental set up regarding the @xmath2 range .",
    "as far as our model is concerned , the perturbative or nonperturbative regime of qcd can be interpreted  @xcite through the relativistic factor ",
    "@xmath5  .",
    "the reality constraint on the form factor @xmath6 leads to the condition @xmath7 , where the case @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) corresponds to the perturbative ( nonperturbative ) limit of qcd .the @xmath9 limit demands large @xmath10 or low @xmath2.so , discussing the nonperturbative effects of qcd with large confinement parameter @xmath11 , we must consider the low @xmath2 limit of @xmath10 in this model .however , we have observed in ref[1 ] that large value of @xmath11(@xmath12 ) prohibits the use of low @xmath2 compelling one to involve with small @xmath10 which corresponds to the perturbative regime and thus ca nt be accounted in this nonperturbative approach .",
    "we reanalyze all these observations in this approach of vipt for both the cases -linear or confinement part as perturbation and coulombic part as perturbation.we will explore the possibility of incorporating significant value of @xmath10 even with large confinement ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "this work will also check the status of both confinement and coulombic part as perurbation and observed the consequences regarding the usable range of @xmath2 to work with in the absence of experimental data for the said mesons .the calculations are done with a fixed value of @xmath10 from v - scheme [ 23 - 25 ] with large confinement effect @xmath14 instead of variation in both.even with this single value of @xmath10 and @xmath11 one can draw similar conclusion regarding the effective range of @xmath2 .",
    "the calculated form factors are plotted graphically to show their variation with @xmath2 for both the cases .",
    "basically , this work explores the possibility of improving the results for form factors and charge radii over those of ref[1,22 ] with the help of vipt.in the process , we also try to find a useful range of @xmath2 which may be workable for the experimental investigations in the later course of time.comparision of both the options is being made to arrive at a conclusion in using vipt .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section 2 contains the formalism , section 3 the result and calculation while section 4 includes the discussion and conclusion .",
    "we breifly reformulate the vipt with the expression for the wavefunction  @xcite corrected upto the first order of @xmath15 state given by : @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the variational parameter ( which is later optimized w.r.t . energy ) considered instead of physical parameter @xmath18.for the coulombic part as parent , the physical parameter is @xmath19 and the optimized variational parameter is @xmath20 [ 12].as done in ref[12],we consider the wave function for triple term consideration of the summation given by equation ( 1 ) above and rewrite the equation ( viz .",
    "eq(45 ) of ref[12 ] ) with the subscript @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) being replaced by @xmath23 :    @xmath24    where the different parameters are given by :    @xmath25    @xmath26\\ ] ]    @xmath27\\ ] ]    and @xmath28\\ ] ] the wavefunctions for single and double term consideration can be obtained by putting @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively in the same equation ( 2 ) .",
    "however we will consider the relativistic version ( @xmath31 ) of the above wave function viz .",
    "@xcite    @xmath32    the relativistic factor @xmath33 is given by  @xcite : @xmath34      the form factor can be expressed as  @xcite : @xmath35 where @xmath36 putting ( 2 ) and ( 7 ) in ( 9 ) we get the form factor as : @xmath37\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the same normalization constant as appeared in equation(54)of ref[12 ] and the different @xmath39 s(@xmath40 ) are defined in the appendix .",
    "the charge radius is derived as  @xcite : @xmath41\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the different @xmath42 s ( @xmath40 ) are defined in the appendix .",
    "the momentum transform of equation ( 7 ) is  @xcite :    @xmath43\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the @xmath44 s which depend on @xmath45 etc are given in the appendix .",
    "if linear potential is treated as perturbation then from equation(15 ) above the following inequality must be preserved :    @xmath46    this inequality leads to a lower limit of @xmath2 namely @xmath47  @xcite above which one have to use the values of @xmath2.the @xmath47 is determined from the condition :    @xmath48    due to the quark mass dependence , @xmath47 s have different values and they are shown in table 3.in the dalgarno method approach  @xcite , the lower limits @xmath47 were large and the formalism failed to account for large confinement effect ( @xmath13)in the nonperturbative qcd regime where @xmath10 values were taken to be large.only in the limit @xmath49 , the @xmath47 values were lowered and the formalism worked for low @xmath2 range  @xcite.in this method of vipt , the values of @xmath47 are shown to be quite small even with large confinement effect ( @xmath13 ) enabling us to work in the nonperturbative qcd regime with large @xmath10 .",
    "we also note that for single term consideration only @xmath50 exists on the rhs of inequality and for double term both @xmath50 and @xmath51 exist.we have also recorded the values of @xmath47 for single and double term consideration in table 3 .",
    "as pointed in ref[10,13 ] linear parent gives rise to airy functions.the physical parameter is @xmath11 and the optimized variational parameter is @xmath52 .we reproduce the analogous wavefunction in this case also for three term consideration of eq.(1 ) as was for the coulombic parent :    @xmath53\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath54 is the normalization constant as appeared in equation(25 ) of ref[13].we note that for single ( double ) term consideration of equation(1 ) the third and fourth term ( fourth term ) is dropped from the equation ( 18 ) and normalization constants also changes to different one ( eq.17 and 21 of ref [ 13 ] ) .",
    "for this case also we take the relativistic version of the above wavefunction : @xmath55 the zeros of the airy function @xmath56 is given by eq.(11 ) of ref[13 ] as : @xmath57^{\\frac{2}{3}}\\ ] ] and @xmath58 where @xmath59 are the normalization constants for @xmath60 and @xmath61 states respectively etc .    like the expressions we have adopted the same values of @xmath62 from ref[13](see tables 1,2 there ) .      putting ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) in the definition of form",
    "factor ( 9 ) given above , the form factor is found to be : @xmath63\\ ] ] the coefficients @xmath64s are given in table 4.they are of course different for single , double or more than two term consideration .",
    "numerical integrations are done in getting the above result .",
    "the corresponding charge radius is obtained by using equation ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) in(12 ) which are recorded in table 4 .",
    "the momentum transform of ( 19 ) is :    @xmath65\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the @xmath66 s ( @xmath67 ) are given in the appendix .",
    "if coulombic potential is treated as perturbation then from equation(24 ) above the following inequality must be preserved :    @xmath68    this inequality leads to a upper limit of @xmath2 namely @xmath47 below which one have to use the values of @xmath2.the @xmath47 is determined from the condition :    @xmath69    the different values of upper limit @xmath47 s are shown in table 5.the corresponding values for single and double term consideration are also shown .",
    "we have listed @xmath70 in table 1 while the lower and upper limit of @xmath47 for single , double and triple term consideration are given in tables 3 and 5 . in table 2 , we record the charge radii for single , double and triple term consideration for coulombic potential as parent ; whereas the same is recorded for linear potential as parent in table 4.the infinite mass consideration shown by the subscript @xmath71 is also included for triple ( single ) term consideration for coulombic ( linear ) parent.the table 6 shows charge radii of different mesons obtained from other models and data .",
    "the @xmath10 values are taken from the @xmath72-scheme  @xcite and the integrations are done numerically for all these calculations .",
    "the graphs show the variation @xmath73 vs @xmath2 for @xmath74 and @xmath3 mesons for both the options .",
    ".values of @xmath70 with @xmath13 for relativistic case only.the values are the same as recorded in table 2 of ref[13 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have analyzed elastic form factors and charge radii in a qcd inspired potential model using vipt under two scenarios - coulombic potential and linear potential as parent .",
    "we use a fixed set of values for @xmath10 under @xmath72-scheme[23 - 25 ] in the calculation , for example it is @xmath77 for the @xmath74 mesons which is larger than the value @xmath78 for the @xmath79 mesons.this consideration directly results in the unexpected smaller values of charge radii for @xmath74 mesons as compared to the @xmath79 mesons.larger @xmath10 values are responsible for smaller charge radius .    \\iv . while checking the status of confinement as perturbation i.e. coulombic parent ( or coulombic part as perturbation i.e. linear parent ) we end up with a lower ( or upper ) limit on @xmath2 .this allows us a useful range of @xmath2 to show the variation of form factor which is shown in fig 1 and 2 .",
    "v. in the present analysis , even with large @xmath11,the lower limit of @xmath2(for linear perturbation ) are really small as shown in table 3 for fixed @xmath10.we have seen that for @xmath80 , the lower limit of @xmath2 for @xmath74 mesons are respectively @xmath81 , whereas with @xmath82 , the lower limit of @xmath2 for @xmath79 mesons are respectively @xmath83 .these values for @xmath79 mesons will be lowered if we put @xmath84 .",
    "this is clearly advantageous over the dalgarno method with linear perturbation as done in ref[1 ] where the formalism broke down for large @xmath11.thus , this approach allows a large value of @xmath85 in the limit @xmath86 even with large confinement , an important feature absent in ref[1 ] .",
    "further , if we look at eq.(1 ) , consideration of different terms leads to different charge radii and the limiting values of @xmath2 for both the cases .",
    "the charge radii and the lower limit of @xmath2 decrease with more terms for the linear part as perturbation ( i.e. coulombic parent ) whereas the charge radii increase and upper limit of @xmath2 decreases for the coulombic part as perturbation ( i.e. linear parent ) .",
    "the above list as a whole suggests success of vipt over the dalgarno method  @xcite as far as large confinement and limiting values of @xmath2 are concerned .",
    "the difference in the values of form factors and charge radii for both the cases may be attributed to the use of same @xmath10 ( i.e. @xmath2 ) under @xmath72-scheme for both the scenarios as the coulombic potential is dominant for large @xmath2 ( i.e.low @xmath87)and the linear potential in the low @xmath2 ( i.e. large @xmath87)regime.we must note that we have used the low @xmath2 assumption in the calculation of form factors and this clearly effects the upper limit of @xmath2 corresponding to the validity of coulombic perturbation ( i.e. linear parent).the larger value of @xmath10 for @xmath75-sector as compared to @xmath76-sector is also another point to take account of this .although , the linear parent has shown more flexibility and hence is the better option than coulombic parent in vipt , but it has used terms up to a particular order in`@xmath87 ' in the integration involved with airy function ( which is an infinite series).this may lead to loss of certain information as far as physics is concerned . in the absence of any experimental results for these mesons , it is quite difficult to make a direct conclusion but there is clear indication that one must be careful in choosing the parameter @xmath85 as well as the confinement parameter in the calculation of form factor and charge radius within the qcd framework .",
    "the above discussion led to the conclusion that there is scope to use this approach in the study of meson decays.the lower and upper limit on @xmath2 ( i.e. range of @xmath2 ) in this analysis may be useful in the experimental set up to investigate cross - section and form factor in future for these mesons.further , from the model specific values of form factors and charge radii the method allows to investigate the behaviour of @xmath10 w.r.t @xmath2 in the nonperturbative regime of qcd .    00",
