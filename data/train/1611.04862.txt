    "in a 1972 seminal work , berg and brown have shown that tracking individual micro - organisms in 3d was a determinant step to understand bacterial motility and chemotactic response to chemical gradients @xcite . at that time the device built by berg and suited to perform the tracking and 3d trajectory reconstruction , was conceptually and technically outstanding @xcite .    since then",
    ", other techniques of 3d tracking have emerged for example , the development of fast piezo scanning has allowed high speed image stack acquisition techniques .",
    "this was used to reconstruct by post analysis micro - organisms swimming trajectories @xcite .",
    "this method though very potent to obtain multiple object trajectories finds its limitation , if the object speed is high . also , it turns out to be strongly dependent on free computer memory capacities limiting the long time tracking possibilities .",
    "interestingly , there are alternative techniques using the defocussing rings of fluorescent particles to access the xyz position and a large number of tracks at the same time @xcite .",
    "the limitation here is the complexity of the post - analysis , increasing with the particle concentration and also the limited range in @xmath0 exploration . past the year 2000",
    ", there was a surge in the development of holographic 3d particle reconstruction techniques ( see for example a review by memmolo et al .",
    "@xcite and refs inside ) .",
    "this tracking method allows by post - analysis , the 3d reconstruction of few simple objects trajectories such as the brownian motion of spherical colloids @xcite and bacteria @xcite .",
    "this method has led recently to important advances in the understanding of sperm swimming trajectories @xcite .    however , these recent 3d tracking methods are of eulerian type , meaning that the volume of observation is fixed in the laboratory reference frame .",
    "it is important to notice that inherently , such eulerian methods may lead to a systematic statistical bias . for trajectories displaying large persistent speed , the particles are likely to leave the volume of observation faster than for other trajectories undergoing for example , a diffusive motion .    lately , increasing interest into the swimming dynamics of micro - organisms made the development of reliable langrangian tracking techniques using modern tools particularly important again @xcite .",
    "here we describe a technique of lagrangian 3d tracking extending the work of berg with modern tools of visualization which allows for a time resolved refocusing of a fluorescent object ( fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) .",
    "the fluorescent particle can be tracked in a quiescent fluid as well as in an imposed flow .",
    "it has the advantage of providing , besides the full 3d object trajectory , a direct image of the particle in its close environment .",
    "the same system can also be used to track fluorescent passive objects like silica or latex tracers .",
    "following such passive objects can be used , for example , for an accurate determination of the flow velocity profiles in micro - fluidic devices ( fig .",
    "[ fig : track3d ] ) .",
    "in addition , a unique feature of the technique described here , is the possibility to track only the bright spots in a crowded environment of opaque objects .",
    "for example it can be particularly interesting to follow a specific fluorescent bacterium in a suspension of other not fluorescent ones in order to characterize the features of collective motion .",
    "position is controlled mechanically and the @xmath1-position via a piezoelectric positioner .",
    "the targeted fluorescent particle position is visualized in a  trapping area  by a ccd camera .",
    "the image is transferred to a labview program processing the information .",
    "the program assesses the current @xmath2 and @xmath1 positions and commands the mechanical and the piezo stages to move up to a new position such as to keep the particle in focus and close to the trap center .",
    "the outputs are the @xmath3 positions record and a video of the particle surrounding . ]",
    "to @xmath4 in height , and the width from @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "the length is approximately 150 mm .",
    "the bacterium here is a wild - type strain of _",
    "( rp 437 ) , transfected with a yellow fluorescent plasmid . ]",
    "the set - up is sketched in fig . [ fig : setup ] .",
    "it is composed of an inverted microscope ( zeiss - observer , z1 ) with a high magnification objective ( @xmath7 zeiss ec epiplan - neofluar ) , a @xmath2 mechanically controllable stage with a @xmath1 piezo - mover from asi and a digital camera andor ixon 897 emccd . the camera output and the stage input / output signals",
    "are connected to a multi - threaded labview software , capable of reassigning the stage position by a real - time feedback loop , keeping one particle in focus in the central visualization field region ( see fig . [",
    "fig : setup ] ) .",
    "the andor camera is very sensitive ( pixel size @xmath8 microns ) and suited to visualize weak fluorescent signals .",
    "it is thus relatively slow , working nominally at 30 fps on a 512 @xmath9 512 @xmath10 matrix . here , we present the performances achieved at a faster tracking speed of @xmath11 reducing the spatial resolution to 128 @xmath9 128 @xmath10 .",
    "the tracking limitations come essentially from the @xmath1 exploration limits .",
    "the z - piezo module used here , has a range of exploration of @xmath12 , however in the present case , the vertical exploration limitation stems essentially from the @xmath13 objective working distance which is of @xmath14 .    from the coordinates of the stage in the laboratory reference frame and the position of the target object in the images , we obtain the three - dimensional trajectories and also a video recording of the fluorescent targeted object . in fig .",
    "[ fig : track3d ] , we present some tracking results obtained with this technique , for passive tracers and for a bacterium in a hele - shaw microfluidic cell under flow .",
    "note that the same technique can also be adapted to an objective of lesser magnification or to a much faster ( though less sensitive ) scmos technology .",
    "the rate of transfer of visual information , its processing and the reaction of the mechanical and piezo - components of the xy and z stages have in all cases to be adapted to the current material possibilities . nevertheless , the method described here remains valid despite the changes of visualization technologies .      in the following ,",
    "we detail the general detection algorithm .",
    "first , when a fluorescent particle reaches the trapping area , the user can decide by clicking on the mouse to start the tracking process .",
    "the first action of the detector is to determine the @xmath15 position of the targeted object , put it in the centre by moving the @xmath15 mechanical stage",
    ". then the system proceeds by scanning very rapidly in @xmath0 to get a defocussing refocussing video that will immediately be analysed .",
    "this first step allows to determine several initialization parameters that will be used subsequently to specify the detection functions .",
    "then , the algorithm starts to work in the nominal mode . at every iteration step of the detection algorithm , an image ( @xmath16 )",
    "is obtained as well as the current stage coordinates and transferred to the labview program . the target position in the image reference frame",
    "is determined and a 3d move is performed by the stage before the next image exposure in @xmath17 , in order to keep the object in the focus volume . for each iteration ,",
    "the object position and the image are recorded . in the following ,",
    "we detail the principles of @xmath15 and of @xmath0 detection and thereafter , the @xmath15 and @xmath0 stage motions .",
    "finally , we address the question of tracking performances .",
    "to track the targeted object in two - dimensions , we use a standard image processing method . the object @xmath18 coordinates in the reference frame of a micro - fluidic chamber ,",
    "are composed of the @xmath19 coordinates of the stage in the laboratory reference frame when the image was exposed , and the @xmath20 coordinates of the object in the ] note that the object does not need to be in the center of the image to determine its @xmath18 position , keeping it in the image bound is enough . to determine @xmath21 , knowing @xmath22 and @xmath23 , we define in @xmath24 a search area ( extracted region of interest , roi ) around the position @xmath22 where the object is expected to be in the new image .",
    "this roi is pre - processed ( gaussian filter and local threshold ) to get a binary image with background correction and to obtain a set of binarized objects .",
    "the objects are filtered to keep the ones of a predefined size and the positions of their geometrical centres are determined .",
    "we keep as @xmath21 the closest object to the former position @xmath25 .",
    "we could easily introduce some memory ( as we will later explain for @xmath1 ) to handle for example , a collisional interaction of two similar particles such as to decipher the trajectory continuity of both objects .",
    "also , for the object detection other methods can be used , like the maximum correlation with a mask .",
    "however , the present one turns out to be quite efficient yielding a computational time under @xmath26 , which allows a margin of @xmath26 for the @xmath1 computing and the stage motion , compatible -in principle- with a tracking at a rate of 100 frames per second .",
    "the principle for the @xmath1 detection differs significantly from the horizontal @xmath2 coordinates assessment .",
    "it is based on an optimized search for a vertical position suited to keep the moving object in focus .",
    "the algorithm keeps the object in focus by minimizing the apparent object width @xmath27 .",
    "the object width is minimal when it is in focus and grows as it is far from the focal plane both above or below .",
    "we could also have used the maximum of light intensity as a determinant for the focus value , but the width minimum allows us to account for the photo - bleaching of the target and it turns out to be a more robust criterion .",
    "it is actually much less sensitive to the noise induced by the presence of other bright objects that may temporally appear in the background .    .",
    "]    once the @xmath2 object position on the image has been determined , the mean radial profile around @xmath22 is computed , i.e. , the average intensity ( @xmath28 ) as a function of the distance to the center ( @xmath29 ) . as a convention",
    ", we compute the width of the object ( @xmath27 ) as twice the distance to the centre at which the intensity has dropped to one - half of the central maximum .",
    "[ fig : ivsr ] shows the radial intensity profile for three positions of the focal plane , below , close and above the particle .",
    "the width of the particle is symmetric close to the focus position and asymmetric when the focal plane is far above or below the object ( fig .",
    "[ fig : width_z ] ) .    all along the tracking process",
    ", the minimum detected width @xmath30 and the central intensity @xmath31 at the moment of the minimum width detection , are kept in memory . whenever a smaller width is encountered through the tracking process",
    ", its value becomes the new @xmath30 and the maximum intensity replaces the @xmath31 . the regular update of these parameters allow to keep track of the photo - bleaching that produces a drastic intensity decrease and a reduction in the object apparent size on the long run .",
    "the initial values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 are set at the beginning of the track by a procedure that we will described later .",
    "the vertical coordinate @xmath32 of the object is defined as the sum of the coordinate of the stage @xmath33 in the laboratory reference , plus a correction @xmath34 representing its distance to the focal plane . in this way , @xmath35 where @xmath34 can be positive or negative and is zero when the object is in focus ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : width_z ] ) . for the computation of @xmath34 we defined several criteria depending on the image of the object .",
    "the features of this function , allow to define three main possible regions for the position of the focal plane @xmath33 : ( i ) the far region below the object , when the focal plane is below the object ( @xmath36 ) , ( ii ) the far region above the object , when the focal plane is far above ( @xmath37 ) and ( iii ) the close central region as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch_z ] .",
    "_ far below  -  _ the far region below the object ( @xmath1 position above the focal plane ) is characterized by the presence of rings around the particle ( fig . [ fig : sketch_z ] ) .",
    "typically , the rings appear when the object is more than @xmath38 above the focal plane position . by measuring the radius @xmath39 of the first ring one can estimate @xmath34 .",
    "the ring size as a function of the distance to the object is approximately linear up to @xmath40 from the object .",
    "this relation allows the reaching of the close central region out of a calibration which is particle and system dependent .",
    "then @xmath41 .    _",
    "far above  -  _ in the far region above the object , the particle appears as a wide and fuzzy white dot of low intensity with no ring .",
    "if the maximum object intensity @xmath42 is lower than a given fraction of the currently stored @xmath31 value ( this coefficient is typically set to @xmath43 but can be adjusted ) , the algorithm recognizes that the focal plane is in the far region above the object .",
    "we have a calibrated function for the width of the particle as a function of its distance to the focus value @xmath44 .",
    "the correction will be calculated as @xmath45 . here",
    "@xmath44 is a second order polynomial represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : width_z ] by the solid line on the right side of the curve .",
    "the detection of this region takes place closer to the object than in the former case of the rings , this implies that a descending bacterium is better followed , i.e. with less noise , than a bacterium with an increasing @xmath1 coordinate .",
    "_ central region  -  _ when the focal plane is in the central region of fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch_z ] , from the scanning of a fixed `` standard '' fluorescent object ( here a bacterium ) , two piece - wise curves for the object s width are fitted as a function to the distance to its center ( fig .",
    "[ fig : width_z ] ) .",
    "one curve for @xmath46 ( @xmath47 , below the object ) and the other one for @xmath48 ( @xmath49 , above the object ) .",
    "the center @xmath50 is a local minimum and close enough to it , the two curves are almost symmetric .    from the image",
    ", one can not know whether the focal plane is slightly above or below the object , therefore we have chosen the right branch @xmath49 that works reasonably good in both cases .",
    "we relate the object s position to the measured width @xmath27 by means of the inverse function",
    ". the absolute value will be @xmath51 and the sign depends on whether the last stage move was successful ( corresponding to width decrease ) or not ( corresponding to a width increase ) .",
    "if the last step was successful , we keep its direction and if not we invert it . as a result",
    ", the stage position fluctuates around the @xmath32 object position .",
    "detection indicating in details the procedure for the coordinate determination starting from the object image .",
    "@xmath52 means that no ring was detected . ]      during the tracking initiation procedure , the fast @xmath1-scan yields a sequence of images typically separated @xmath53 around the object . for every image , the object width ( @xmath27 )",
    "is determined and thereafter the minimum width @xmath30 . from the image giving @xmath30",
    "we also get and store the maximum intensity @xmath31 and position @xmath54 . at the end of the sweep ,",
    "the stages goes to the best @xmath1 coordinate and the tracking variables are fully initialized .    for the @xmath2 stage motion ,",
    "a proportional integrative derivative ( pid ) algorithm is used and empirically tuned , to perform a progressive motion .",
    "this avoids to couple directly the detection and displacement , that would keep the object strictly centred in the image and potentially introducing spurious mechanical perturbations and instabilities due to abrupt movements of the object .",
    "this is possible since for @xmath2 detection we just need to keep the object in the trapping zone and determined the true position from the particle centre determination from image analysis .    for the @xmath1 stage displacement ,",
    "when the detected region is far below or above , the stage is moved with a value @xmath55 and reaches the central region in one step .    in the central region , the stage is moved at a displacement amplitude @xmath56 where we take into account a second order contribution to the position , incorporating in the computation the object displacement between two consecutive images . this way , @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the object velocity along @xmath1 , computed in real time from the previous displacement .",
    "the coefficient @xmath59 is positive between 0 and 1 , being 0 when @xmath27 is close to @xmath30 and 1 for low values of the ratio @xmath60 .",
    "the coefficient value @xmath59 is obtained from an empirical extrapolation function @xmath61 $ ] .    as said previously , the sign of @xmath62 depends on the improvement ( i.e. minimization ) of @xmath27 when compared to the previous step .",
    "due to the buffer of the camera , we obtain the images with a delay of two periods of sampling , then , the more recent captured image is not a direct consequence of the last order that was given to the stage . to avoid taking bad decisions due to this lack of synchronization , we lowered the effective sampling frequency and react on the @xmath1 position at a rate being one third of the reaction rate for the @xmath2 motion .",
    "importantly , the @xmath2 motion is performed using two lead screws , one for each axis .",
    "an inherent feature of such mechanical displacement stage is the existence of a backlash , i.e. the screws need some finite back - rotation to restart a reverse motion . for our system",
    "the backlash is of the order of @xmath63 .",
    "since our stage controller uses rotary encoders , this repetitive error is not visible from the recorded stage data .",
    "so , we use a correction algorithm in the post - processing to remove this error from the track data .",
    "an improvement for the setup would be to replace the rotary encoder by an optical linear encoder which returns the real position of the stage , thus processing the backlash in real time .",
    "now we describe how to correct the mechanical backlash .",
    "it is inherent to mechanical systems where there is an amount of clearance between mated mechanical components , like gear teeth .",
    "the backlash manifests itself when the motion direction is reversed and the slack or lost motion is taken up before the reversal of motion is completed . in the case of our tracking microscope ,",
    "the mechanism for the @xmath2 displacement is mechanical , therefore , not exempt of backlash .",
    "the @xmath1 displacement is a piezoelectric displacement , essentially providing a high precision positioning at the nanometer scale . in general , for many high precision microscopic devices , the stages allow to perform very precise displacements by following an algorithm for motion allowing to work around the backlash . before a move",
    ", the stage goes to an intermediate position far away , allowing to always come from the same direction to the targeted position .",
    "this is certainly not suitable for bacteria tracking , where the stage has to follow the swimmers as it moves .",
    "here we compensate for the stage backlash in a post - processing treatment of the trajectories .",
    "note that this step is crucial and special care has to be taken when building a 3d tracking device in order to avoid false data recording due to the backlash problem .",
    "the first step is to characterize the backlash magnitude along the @xmath64 and @xmath65 directions . to this purpose",
    ", we tracked a fluorescent latex bead stuck on a glass plate , switching off the moving capability of the stage . in this condition",
    ", the software recognizes the particle position but does not move the stage to have it in focus .",
    "we start the tracking with the bead in focus in the center of the image and manually displace the stage in @xmath2 by means of the joystick while always keeping the particle in the image . in this case",
    "the bead displacement in the image should be equal to the stage displacement , and the sum should compensate at every time since the particle did not move with respect to the microfluidic chamber @xmath66 ( see equation ( [ x_chamber ] ) ) .",
    "the apparent displacements with respect to the chamber are then solely due to the backlash error .",
    "[ fig : ycorrection ] shows with black circles in the top the @xmath67 stage position as we move it , and using the same scale in the bottom the resultant position of the object @xmath68 in the chamber is shown .",
    "we can then see that the later is not of constant value , but it is shifted by an quasi constant value of @xmath69 every time the direction of the stage is reversed and the stage displaces more than this distance .    to compensate for the backlash",
    ", we have analysed independently the @xmath70 and @xmath67 stage coordinates response to a motion reversal . as the stage moves and changes direction along one or both @xmath64 or @xmath65 , @xmath70 or @xmath67 will inverse displacement direction and",
    "the indicated stage position will be false .",
    "the stage may still be in the same place until the backlash is overcome . as a consequence , a wrong displacement information is introduced in the stage coordinates . to correct for the stage position",
    ", we assume that a real displacement does not take place until it is bigger than a certain distance @xmath71 in the case of motion inversion along @xmath64 ( or @xmath72 for backward motion along @xmath65 ) .",
    "once this gap is overcome , the rest of the trajectory is shifted to match the previous position where the stage was clutched .",
    "this correction can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ycorrection ] ( top ) .",
    "it results in a delay every time the direction is inverted with a subsequent reduction of stage displacement .",
    "the final particle position in the channel is affected following equation ( [ x_chamber ] ) .",
    "we repeat this procedure for different values of @xmath71 and @xmath72 independently and determine the values @xmath73 and @xmath74 that minimize the standard deviation of the corrected positions @xmath75 and @xmath68 .",
    "these turn the step function in fig .",
    "[ fig : ycorrection ] ( bottom ) into an almost constant red line that better reflects the fixed position with respect to the chamber .",
    "the optimal values @xmath76 and @xmath77 turned out to be the same for independent realizations of the stage displacements .",
    "coordinates of the stage ( top panel ) and particle position ( bottom panel ) .",
    "black circles are the raw measurements and the red line the same magnitudes after backlash correction . ]      to assess the quality of the tracking method we follow latex beads performing brownian motion . due to the intrinsic difference in the tracking principles in @xmath15 and @xmath0 we present separated analyses .",
    "the motion in @xmath78 and @xmath79 stemming from an endless screw machinery , the main source of uncertainty comes from the presence of backlash .",
    "random brownian motion is indeed a severe test . on the other hand ,",
    "the main source of uncertainty for the @xmath0 position is not the backlash ( piezo device ) , but the quality of the @xmath0 detection algorithm .",
    "note that for the present fluorescent objects the @xmath0 detection algorithm is not a zero - crossing but a minimum detection method much less accurate to fix precisely a position .    for the @xmath78 and",
    "@xmath79 coordinates , we first followed a diffusive latex bead in a quiescent suspension by switching off the moving capability of the stage .",
    "the position of the particle is determined in real time solely by the image analysis part of the algorithm , as long as the particle remains in the region of visualization .",

    "<S> we detail the elaboration of a tracking device mounted on an epifluorescent inverted microscope and suited to obtain time resolved 3d lagrangian tracks of fluorescent micro - objects . </S>",
    "<S> the system is based on a real - time image processing driving a mechanical x - y stage displacement and a z refocusing piezo mover such as to keep the designed object at a fixed position in a moving frame . </S>",
    "<S> track coordinates with respect to the microfluidic device , as well as images of the object in the laboratory reference frame are thus obtained at a frequency of several tenths of hertz . </S>",
    "<S> this device is particularly adapted to follow the trajectory of motile micro - organisms in microfluidic devices with or without flow . </S>"
