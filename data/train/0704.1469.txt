    "for a non - frustrated system the simple bond flip ( [ hijoff ] ) makes for a convenient stochastic implementation of the ground state projection ( [ projection ] ) .",

    "it is very convenient to use a state which has equal overlaps with all the vb basis states , e.g. , the nel state @xmath63 ( all spins up on sublattice a and down on b ) .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath64 for any basis state @xmath56 .",
    "since @xmath65 is a sum of basis states multiplied by factors @xmath66 or @xmath67 , the overlaps with @xmath68 drop out altogether and do not have to be considered further . if the projector strings @xmath54 in ( [ hexp ] ) are importance - sampled according to their weights @xmath58 , the estimator for the ground state energy is thus @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are , respectively , the number of diagonal and off - diagonal operations @xmath72 ( and @xmath73 ) .",

[ vbloops ] ) : @xmath80 measuring the spin correlations is hence straight - forward once the overlap - loops have been constructed .",
    "higher - order functions , e.g. , dimer - dimer correlations @xmath81 , are also related to the loop structure @xcite .",
    "note again that no bond operator @xmath82 can destroy a vb state and that all the states have non - zero overlap with each other .",
    "thus all terms in ( [ aexp ] ) contribute to the expectation value .",
    "this turns out to be an advantage in constructing a monte carlo algorithm , as any change made in the operator strings can be accepted with some probability . with an orthogonal basis , such as the @xmath3 eigenstates , there would be considerable constraints , both in terms of individual operators in the projection [ the spin flip operator in ( [ heisenberg ] ) can act , without destroying the state , only on anti - parallel spins ] , and in ensuring a non - zero overlap between the propagated states ( the two propagated states have to be identical ) .",
    "note also that the singlet projectors are non - hermitian in the vb basis . as indicated in ( [ aexp ] ) , and illustrated in fig .",
    "[ propagation ] , we here propagate two states , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , and subsequently compute their overlap and various matrix elements . propagating @xmath56 with @xmath85 and then taking the overlap with @xmath56 is not equivalent term - by - term .    to carry out the projection stochastically , the operator strings are stored in arrays @xmath86 =   [ b^\\alpha_1][b^\\alpha_2]\\cdots [ b^\\alpha_m]$ ] , where @xmath87 with @xmath88 corresponding to @xmath54 and @xmath89 , respectively , in the double projection ; in the single projection @xmath90 is redundant .",

    "the state is propagated with the updated operator string and the number of off - diagonal operations @xmath59 in ( [ wrk ] ) is counted . in the single expansion , the acceptance probability is simply @xmath106 = { \\rm min}[2^{m_{\\rm off}^{\\rm old}-m_{\\rm off}^{\\rm new}},1 ] , \\label{pacc}\\ ] ] whereas in the double projection an overlap ratio appears as well .",
    "in the double projection , we change operators only in one of the operator strings at a time , so that only one state has to be propagated .",
    "it is customary to define a size - normalized monte carlo step ( or  sweep \" ) . for projector length @xmath30 we do @xmath30 replacement attempts , and",
    "so our sweep is independent of the number of operators @xmath98 replaced in each update .    normally , in monte carlo simulations",
    "one does not compute the full weight , because it is possible to more speedily calculate just the change in the weight [ the weight ratio in ( [ pacc ] ) ] . in the present formulation of the vb projector algorithm",
    "the weight is , however , recomputed from scratch each time , because a better scheme is not yet known .",
    "each update hence requires on the order of @xmath30 operations . in the double expansion , construction of the loops needed to compute the overlap scales as @xmath16 , but typically @xmath107 and the propagation of the state dominates the simulation . in spite of the need to recalculate the weight ,",

    "it also depends only weakly on the lattice size .",
    "multiplying the acceptance rate by @xmath98 gives the average number of operators changed ; it initially increases with @xmath98 but has a maximum for @xmath110 ( for @xmath111 ) .",
    "the optimum @xmath98 is clearly model / lattice dependent .",
    "another characteristic of the update is the number of bonds changed in the projected state @xmath57 as a consequence of the modifications of @xmath54 .",
    "this number is shown in fig .",
    "[ arate](b ) .",
    "it is seen to increase with @xmath98 , as expected . as a function of @xmath30 the number of changed bonds decreases .",
    "this behavior reflects a loop structure of the singlet - projection operators @xcite , which implies that some changes  upstream \" in the operator string may be healed further downstream in the propagation . for a finite lattice in the limit @xmath74",
    "one would expect a substitution of an operator far upstream in @xmath54 to have no effect on the final propagated state @xmath57 .",
    "this does not imply that this update is inconsequential , as the sampling is over paths , not just the final states in the propagations . in principle",
    ", it should be possible to take advantage of the underlying loop structure of the singlet projectors @xcite to devise a loop update in the vb basis , analogous to such updates in world - line @xcite and sse @xcite simulations .",
    "however , we have not yet been able to construct a scheme that is in practice faster than the trivial random substitution with full state propagation .",
    "so far , we have projected the ground state out of a single vb basis state @xmath56 .",
    "this works well @xcite , but the rate of convergence with @xmath30 of course depends on the state chosen ; ideally one would like to maximize the overlap @xmath112 .",
    "one way to obtain a typically good single - configuration trial state is to first start with an arbitrary one ; a regular bond pattern or a randomly generated configuration . after carrying out some projection steps with this state , the current propagated state @xmath57",
    "is chosen as a new trial state .",
    "since this state has been generated in the projection it should contribute substantially to the ground state and hence typically will be better than a completely arbitrary one .",

    "we can thus measure triplet properties using paths generated in a singlet simulation , by considering only those triplet paths that do survive the propagation . in the trial state",
    "we have @xmath17 possible locations of the triplet .",
    "all of them can be attempted collectively in a single propagation , by keeping counters @xmath190 for the number of surviving states in which the triplet is connected to site @xmath13 ( with @xmath13 on sublattice a ) .",
    "initially @xmath191 for all @xmath13 . during the propagation , for each diagonal operation ( [ tdia ] ) @xmath192 , and for each off - diagonal operation ( [ toff ] ) @xmath192 , @xmath193 .",
    "eventually , as @xmath74 , all triplets die ; @xmath194 for all @xmath13 , but typically there are enough survivors left at large enough @xmath30 to compute converged triplet properties .",
    "an added advantage of calculating singlet and triplet properties in the same run is that there are error cancellations which in some cases can increase the statistical precision of differences , e.g. , the singlet - triplet gap @xcite , @xmath195 by up to orders of magnitude relative to two independent calculations .",
    "the triplet energy @xmath196 can be estimated using ( [ esingle ] ) , taking into account that a diagonal operation on a triplet bond gives zero , i.e. , @xmath197 , where , for surviving triplet configurations , @xmath198 is the number of triplet bonds of length @xmath49 .",
    "other triplet properties have been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we now discuss calculations with triplets of arbitrary momentum @xmath172 .",
    "the energy can be evaluated according to @xmath199 we want to evaluate this expression using the sampled @xmath176 singlet bond configurations , and so we rewrite it as @xmath200 the two factors can be evaluated based on sampling the propagations @xmath54 and the amplitude - product state @xmath201 [ which we have not explicitly written as a sum of bond configurations in ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) ] . in the singlet energy ( [ hexp ] ) , we could pick the nel state for @xmath202 and then obtained the very simple expression ( [ esingle ] ) .",
    "now we must consider the overlap with a momentum @xmath172 triplet state .",
    "we use @xmath203 , but in ( [ eq2 ] ) have rewritten @xmath204 so that only the overlap with @xmath205 has to be considered for the sampling weight .",
    "phases arising from @xmath206 only appear in the measurements , but in the end we have to evaluate the ratio of the two quantities in ( [ eq2 ] ) , which can be challenging in practice .",
    "however , close to @xmath177 and @xmath207 [ @xmath208 we find that it can be done ; in some cases the method works even far away from these momenta .",
    "we define the dispersion relative to the gap ( [ gap ] ) at @xmath209 ; @xmath210 fig .",
    "[ eq ] shows results for @xmath211 and @xmath212 , where @xmath213 is the momentum closest to but not equal to @xmath209 ; @xmath214 .",
    "we show the convergence as a function of @xmath215 for @xmath216 and @xmath161 lattices , comparing with exact diagonalization results in the former case . from ( [ projection ] ) one would expect the convergence to be asymptotically exponential , which is seen clearly for @xmath217 . for @xmath111 ,",
    "the three largest-@xmath30 points are equal within statistical errors , suggesting that these results are also close to converged . using @xmath218 for the @xmath111 system gives the spin - wave velocity @xmath219 , in very close agreement with the known value @xcite .     for @xmath217 ( left ) and @xmath220 ( right ) lattices .",
    "the horizontal lines show the exact results for @xmath217,width=377 ]    another useful quantity accessible with the vb projector is the matrix element @xmath221 , the square of which gives the single - magnon weight in the dynamic structure factor ( which is experimentally measurable using neutron scattering )",
    ". it can be calculated in a way similar to @xmath204 , and we have done so successfully for @xmath172 close to @xmath209 .",
    "results will be presented elsewhere .",
    "finally , we also note that the triplet bond - length distribution gives a direct , albeit basis dependent , window into the  spinon \" aspects @xcite of the excitations .",
    "spinon deconfinement should be manifested as a delocalized distribution function , whereas two spinons bound into a magnon or  triplon \" should be reflected in a well - defined peak in the distribution function .",
    "we are currently exploring this .",
