    "although early models of fireballs @xcite did not postulate baryons within , the existence of baryons in @xmath4-ray burst ( grb ) fireballs was anticipated because the highly super - eddington luminosities suggest that baryons are expelled .",
    "in fact , the baryonic component that is expected to accompany such an outflow would quench the @xmath2-ray emission .",
    "this realization led to the popularization of a model for grbs in which baryonic kinetic energy was reclaimed at large radii by internal shocks to be used for making high energy particles @xcite and @xmath2-rays @xcite .",
    "this model postulated fewer baryons than expected from a - priori estimates of the super - eddington flux - driven mass outflow , but it did invoke baryons , or in any case matter that survived annihilation in the compact regions closer to the central engine .",
    "the above models should be contrasted with internal shocks models in which there are few baryons @xcite where the role of the internal shocks , presumably near the photosphere , is simply to non - thermalize the spectrum of @xmath2-rays that dominate the energy content . in particular , the reclamation of baryonic kinetic energy by internal shocks for the purposes of making the prompt @xmath2-radiation of the grb itself @xcite led to the prediction that there should be a blast wave in the circumburst medium that would generate afterglow .",
    "the discovery of afterglow appeared to provide enormous support to the internal shocks model of @xcite , who had predicted such an afterglow .    on the other hand",
    ", it has never been proven that the @xmath2-rays and the ejecta are made by the same components of the outflow .",
    "more generally , the ratio of @xmath2-ray to baryonic energy per solid angle may vary considerably within the outflow in a way that would have significant consequences both for observations and for theories of grb origin .",
    "one consequence of grb baryon anisotropy would be lines of sight that are more favored than others for grb detection while others might be more favorable for seeing early afterglow . in this _ letter _",
    ", we argue in favor of this hypothesis . in  [ ba ] we present arguments in favor of baryon anisotropy . in  [ flat ]",
    "we show that the combination of the decaying tail of the prompt emission and the flat early afterglow light curve from viewing angles slightly outside the edge of the region within the jet with prominent afterglow emission can produce the early flat decay phase of the x - ray afterglows recently observed by _",
    "swift_. our conclusions are discussed in  [ diss ] .",
    "several arguments have been put forth that the baryon richness of a grb fireball relative to the @xmath2-ray intensity varies with the viewing angle for a given fireball .",
    "@xcite argued theoretically that the anatomy of a grb is likely to be poynting flux or @xmath2-rays emerging from horizon - threading magnetic field lines , while the baryons might flow out predominantly near the periphery of the above , along field lines that thread the interface of the inner accretion disk and the event horizon . on field lines that thread the accretion disk , which should also have a super - eddington power output , there ought to be a `` slow sheath '' of baryons that , while being too baryon rich to yield a detectable grb , would yield a contribution to the afterglow and possibly a `` dirty fireball '' .",
    "several observations have also been interpreted in the context of a dichotomy between the baryon poor flow lines and the baryon rich ones .",
    "scattering of @xmath2-rays from baryon poor regions off more slowly moving baryons could yield a weak spray of @xmath2-rays at large angles .",
    "such scattered emission would be a very small fraction ( @xmath5 ) of the total , and would thus be detectable only for very nearby grbs .",
    "nevertheless , they would be detectable over a much larger solid angle , and would be manifested as soft grbs ( no photons well above an mev ) , with smooth light curves from nearby sources .",
    "grb 980425 was a good example of such a grb and was interpreted in this light @xcite .",
    "another intriguing result of baryon anisotropy of the grb fireball could be that the @xmath2-ray emission itself - not just the baryonic content - could have a non - trivial angular profile . here",
    "the details have not been worked out yet .",
    "it could be , for example , that most of the emission in the interior of the outflow is virgin poynting flux , and that the @xmath2-rays themselves are generated preferentially at the periphery of the fireball where the poynting flux is somehow tapped by interaction with the slower baryonic sheath .",
    "it is also not yet established under what conditions virgin poynting flux creates afterglow .",
    "if a necessary condition for afterglow is that external protons can execute at least one gyroradius in the comoving frame within a proper hydrodynamic timescale , @xmath6 , then the condition can be expressed @xcite as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the electric potential energy drop , @xmath9 , across the ejecta in units of @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the magnetic field in the lab frame .",
    "this would typically imply that @xmath12 for grbs",
    ". however , there are still several additional considerations that could be relevant . if the angular structure of the @xmath2-ray emitting region is more complicated than a solid cone , then the fraction of the total solid angle from which the @xmath2-rays are detectable that corresponds to off - beam viewing angles increases , thus making such lines of sight more probable . in this regard , the @xcite and @xcite relations , which correlate the spectral peak photon energy , @xmath13 , and the apparent isotropic equivalent energy , @xmath14 ,",
    "can both be explained as viewing angle effects @xcite .",
    "grbs with @xmath15mev are interpreted as viewed off - beam at angles @xmath16 from the edge of the jet .",
    "this lowers both the observed @xmath14 and @xmath13 in a way that conforms to the amati relation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the value of the jet opening angle that is inferred from the observed break time in the afterglow and the observed @xmath14 is then slightly overestimated relative to its true value , because the observed @xmath14 is underestimated relative to its true value . when this slight overestimate is accounted for",
    ", the ghirlanda relation becomes equivalent to the amati relation @xcite .",
    ", ( where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the original and final opening angles of the scattered radiation ) is presumed to be scattered by slowly moving ( say non - relativistic ) material to large angles , then the observed @xmath14 is lowered by an additional factor f with no further change in @xmath19 , and such sources should be highly distinct outliers to the amati relation , as they are observed to be . ]",
    "another recent piece of evidence for baryon anisotropy comes from the 2004 december 27 giant flare from sgr  1806@xmath2020 .",
    "the radio afterglow @xcite that followed this event has been interpreted as being powered by a baryonic mass outflow of @xmath21 g @xcite that is probably driven from the neutron star surface .",
    "this tentative conclusion is based on the fact that if the required mass was , instead , dominated by swept up external medium , this would require a highly contrived and unrealistic external density profile in order to explain the observed evolution of the source size , motion , and flux @xcite . furthermore , this outflow should have been only mildly relativistic , with @xmath22 , close to the escape velocity from the surface of the neutron star @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "such a large and mildly relativistic baryonic outflow would have ( at least partly ) obscured the prompt @xmath2-rays from the flare had they been expelled in our direction .",
    "the data can be reconciled , however , by the assumption that the baryons are ejected in some directions and not others .",
    "@xcite reconsidered the issue of blast efficiency , making the assumption that @xmath13 is determined mostly by the viewing angle effect .",
    "the blast efficiency was computed by previous authors based on the x - ray afterglow at 10 hours .",
    "it was found that when the ratio of blast energy to apparent @xmath2-ray energy is tabulated for grbs with known redshifts , the ratio is of order unity but with a great deal of scatter .",
    "this scatter , however , is considerably reduced when the ratio of `` viewing angle corrected '' @xmath2-ray energy , is taken to be a measure of the doppler factor that corresponds to the viewing offset angle . ]",
    "@xmath23 , is compared with blast wave energy , and the characteristic value of the @xmath2-ray to kinetic energy ratio seems to be @xmath24 .",
    "that is , nearly @xmath25 of the energy goes into radiation ( @xmath2-rays ) and only about @xmath26 goes into the blast wave .",
    "even if the @xmath25 gamma ray efficiency was the case for all grb , this would raise serious problems for the internal shocks model , in which the @xmath2-ray energy is powered by whatever fraction of the baryonic kinetic energy can be radiated away by the internal shocks . in particular",
    ", it would require the internal shocks to consistently radiate away nearly @xmath25 of the total energy within the observed photon energy range and consistently leave the same small fraction .",
    "it is hard to see how internal shocks , which are by nature erratic , could perform so efficiently and so consistently .",
    "moreover , even if internal shocks could consistently convert more than @xmath25 of the kinetic energy into internal energy , they would still need to put more than @xmath25 of the internal energy into electrons ( and therefore @xmath27 into ions ) which could radiate this energy within the dynamical ( i.e. expansion ) time .",
    "although there in no definitive model for supercritical ultra - relativistic shocks , this requirement would run contrary to theoretical expectations . to make matter worse , eichler and jontof - hutter ( 2005 ) found that several outlying grb had an even higher gamma ray efficiency @xmath28 .",
    "they suggested that these grb were viewed along a line of sight that , even after 10 hours , remained outside the @xmath29 emission cone of the baryons .",
    "the idea that many grbs are viewed slightly off the main intensity peak by a finite offset angle , @xmath30 , was used @xcite to interpret delayed onset of x - ray afterglow that was reported by @xcite .",
    "the delay is simply the time needed for the flow to decelerate to a lorentz factor @xmath31 , beyond which time the afterglow beam encompasses our line of sight .",
    "this would predict , under the assumption that the afterglow - generating blast wave and the @xmath2-ray beam coincide , that the lower the spectral peak , the longer it will take for the afterglow to assume its full on - beam value @xcite .",
    "however , the outliers to the @xmath32 - @xmath33 correlation found by eichler and jontof - hutter ( 2005 ) suggest that this correlation could be contaminated by many grb that are bright , spectrally hard and have extensively delayed afterglow onset .",
    "very recently , @xcite arrived at a similar conclusion using early x - ray afterglow data taken by _",
    "swift_. the early x - ray afterglows frequently show an intermediate phase ( @xmath34 ) of very flat flux decay at early times ( between a few @xmath35s and @xmath1s ) that is deficient relative to expectations from a uniform adiabatic blast wave . among this subset of grbs",
    ", it typically takes the x - ray afterglow a few hours to attain the values inferred from _ bepposax _",
    "they note that for @xmath36 , the @xmath37ray efficiency , @xmath38 , is typically much higher than previously inferred @xcite , yet at @xmath39 , the distribution in these efficiencies converges to the narrow range of values inferred previously .. in this class of bursts @xmath40 and the blast efficiencies @xmath41 have greater relative scatter due to their smaller values . ]    yet another possible effect produced by offset viewing is the spectral evolution of spikes in the prompt grb emission , which scale as @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "this can be interpreted as the spike being due to an accelerating blob of matter that scatters primary radiation into our line of sight .",
    "assuming that the blob is being accelerated to high @xmath43 by an extremely super - eddington radiation flux in the direction of the local radiation flux , the lorentz factor of the blob scales as @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "a spectral peak photon energy which is @xmath45 in the source frame , is @xmath46 in the blob frame , and @xmath47 in the observer s frame .",
    "once the blob has accelerated to @xmath48 , then the observed time scales linearly with radius , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is asymptotically constant ( @xmath51 ) so that @xmath52 .",
    "the general picture of matter being accelerated by radiation is consistent with the inference argued above that the matter draws its kinetic energy from the radiation rather than the other way around .",
    "the explanation favored by @xcite for the early flat part of the x - ray afterglow light curves that were observed by _",
    "swift _ is energy injection into the afterglow shock ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "here we suggest an alternative explanation for this early flat phase , namely the flat early afterglow light curve for viewing angles slightly outside the ( rather sharp ) edge of the jet ( i.e. outside the regions where the energy per solid angle in the external shock is large enough to produce bright afterglow emission ) .    for such `` off - beam '' lines of sight ,",
    "the afterglow flux initially rises , at early times , as the beaming of the radiation away from the line of sight gradually decreases with time , then rounds off as the afterglow beaming cone expands enough to include the line of sight , and finally gradually joins the decaying `` on - beam '' light curve ( seen by observers within the jet ) .",
    "for a point source , the fluxes seen by off - beam and on - beam observers are related by @xmath53 @xcite , where @xmath30 is the angle between the source s velocity and the direction to the observer in the lab frame , @xmath54 is the observed time , @xmath55 is the ratio of the off - beam ( at @xmath30 ) and on - beam ( @xmath56 ) doppler factors , and the last equality is valid when @xmath57 .",
    "thus , the off - beam flux is suppressed relative to the on - beam flux by a factor @xmath58 . for early times , when @xmath59 , we have @xmath60 and @xmath61 where @xmath62 , so that @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the point source limit is valid when the angle @xmath30 from the closest point along the edge of the jet is larger than the typical angular extent of the jet , @xmath66 .",
    "however , more often the opposite is true , i.e. @xmath67 ( or @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the initial lorentz factor of the jet ) , in which case the dependence of @xmath70 on @xmath71 decreases by one power @xcite to @xmath72 .",
    "this implies @xmath73 and @xmath74 at very early times .",
    "[ lc1 ] shows two tentative fits to the x - ray light curve of grb  050315 , which is perhaps the best monitored x - ray light curve showing a pronounced early flat phase @xcite .",
    "the first fit ( _ red solid line _ ) is for a gaussian jet , calculated using model 1 of @xcite , where lateral expansion is neglected , the jet dynamics is calculated according to a simplified semi - analytic formulation of the energy conservation equation , and the light curve is calculated by integrating over the equal arrival time surface of photons to the observer , assuming a simple piece - wise power law synchrotron ( and synchrotron self - compton ) spectrum in comoving frame .",
    "the second fit ( _ dashed blue line _ ) if for a jet with a cross section in the shape of a thick ring , calculated using the model developed in @xcite where the light curve is calculated by integrating over the surface of equal arrival time of photons to the observer , while the jet dynamics are simplified .",
    "the latter model was also used in the _ inset _ of fig .",
    "[ lc1 ] , which shows the light curves for different viewing angles . in all cases",
    "the early fast decay is attributed to the tail emission of the prompt grb @xcite and is modeled by a steep power law . as derived analytically in the previous paragraph ,",
    "the light curves for off - beam viewing angles show a rather sharp rise in the flux at very early times .",
    "however , in most cases the steep early rise of the afterglow emission is hidden below the steeply decaying tail of the prompt grb emission .",
    "[ lc1 ] demonstrates that the combination of the decaying tail emission of the prompt grb and the gently rising or rounding off afterglow emission from slightly off - beam viewing angles can produce a flat early phase in the afterglow light curves , similar to those seen by _ swift _ in the x - rays @xcite . in some cases we expect to even see a gentle rise at very early times . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ lc1 ] , different combinations of jet structure and viewing angle can generally fit the same observed x - ray light curve .",
    "[ lc2 ] demonstrates the dependence of the early rise in the afterglow light curves , for off - beam viewing angles , on the jet structure and dynamics .",
    "the three bottom panels are taken from @xcite and are calculated using model 1 of @xcite .",
    "the second panel shows afterglow light curves from a uniform jet with sharp edges for different viewing angles @xmath75 from the jet symmetry axis .",
    "the light curves are similar to those for a wide ring jet ( fig .",
    "[ lc1 ] ) for similar off - beam viewing angles .",
    "the two bottom panels in fig .",
    "[ lc2 ] are for a gaussian jet , and show that the smoother the edges of the jet ( both in terms of energy per solid angle and in terms of the initial lorentz factor @xmath69 ) , the shallower the initial rise in the flux for off - beam viewing angles .",
    "the upper panel in fig .",
    "[ lc2 ] shows the afterglow light curves for an initially sharp edged jet whose dynamics were calculated using a hydrodynamic simulation @xcite .",
    "the initial conditions were a cone of half - opening angle @xmath76 taken out of the spherical self - similar solution of @xcite .",
    "the light curves for off - beam viewing angles , and especially for @xmath77 , are much flatter at early times compared to those calculated using semi - analytic models for the jet dynamics , since the shocked external medium at the sides of the jet has a significantly smaller lorentz factor than that near the head of the jet , and therefore its emission is not so strongly beamed away from off - beam lines of sight .",
    "thus we conclude that very flat ( either a very shallow rise or a very shallow decay ) early afterglow light curves are expected for a realistic jet structure and dynamics .",
    "combined with the rapidly decaying tail of the prompt grb emission , this can nicely reproduce the observed early flat parts of the x - ray afterglow light curve observed by _ swift_.",
    "we have shown that the early flat phase in the x - ray afterglow light curves observed by _ swift _ is broadly consistent with earlier predictions that afterglow onset might appear delayed to an `` offset viewer '' - an observer who is outside of the directed beam of baryons .",
    "many authors ( e.g. panataiscu and meszaros , 1998 , panataiscu , meszros and rees 1999 , moderski , sikora and bulik 2000 , granot et al 2001 , dalai , griest and pruet 2002 , dado , dar , and de rujula 2002 ) have noted that offset viewing would suppress early afterglow and presumably prompt gamma rays as well .",
    "@xcite predicted that this would be the case for orphan afterglows , and @xcite argued that this is expected for x - ray flashes ( and nicely agrees with their pre-_swift _ optical and x - ray early afterglows ) , assuming that the softening or non - appearance of prompt @xmath2-rays in these instances is due to offset viewing ( relative to both the regions of prominent @xmath2-ray and afterglow emission , which were assumed to coincide ) . @xcite and @xcite predicted that this could also be the case for `` normal '' @xmath2-ray bursts with a bright prompt emission if the viewer is in the direct beam of the gamma rays but not of the baryons .",
    "delays of several minutes in some afterglows whose onsets were serendipitously caught by the wide field camera of _ bepposax _ @xcite led @xcite to conjecture that the prompt emission was seen along an afterglow - inefficient line of sight , and that , if caught during the first several hours , an even larger fraction of afterglow onsets would appear delayed .",
    "this now seems to be the case in our view .",
    "we have argued here that the stage of flat decay , often seen within the first few hours of afterglow , can be attributed to the delayed onset discussed in these earlier papers .    for off - beam viewing angles relative to the region of prominent afterglow emission , we might expect a correlation between the flatness of flat decay phase ( i.e. its temporal index @xmath78 where @xmath79 ) and its luminosity , where a flatter decay would on average have a lower luminosity .",
    "this indeed appears to be the case judging from figs . 1 of @xcite , where the scatter in luminosity is significantly reduced at late times .",
    "this is hard to explain with late time energy infusion , which would be expected , rather , to increase the amount of scatter at late times relative to early ones .",
    "if the same viewing angles are also off - beam relative to the region of prominent @xmath2-ray emission , one might expect a correlation between @xmath78 and the spectral peak photon energy , @xmath19 , or isotropic equivalent energy in @xmath2-rays , @xmath14 .",
    "tables 1 and 2 of @xcite show no obvious apparent correlation between @xmath78 and @xmath14 .",
    "the lack of such a correlation would suggest , under the off - beam interpretation , that _ the regions of prominent afterglow emission and of prominent @xmath2-ray emission do not coincide _ , as we have suggested in this work .",
    "furthermore , some of the grbs recorded by _ swift _",
    ", such as grb 050315 , have a rather large @xmath14 _ as well as _ long stages of very flat decay , and could be interpreted in our view as being due to lines of sight along which the afterglow emission was intrinsically weak . such a weak afterglow emission",
    "can easily be attributed to a paucity of baryons relative to @xmath2-rays in the outflow along our line of sight .",
