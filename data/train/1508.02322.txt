    "the quest to measure forces at quantum limits of sensitivity @xcite has been a primary thrust for the development of optomechanics @xcite and the search for quantum effects in macroscopic mechanical resonators . for measurement schemes based on the optical detection of resonator motion ,",
    "the trade - off between measurement imprecision due to shot noise and the measurement backaction on the resonator leads to a standard quantum limit ( sql ) .",
    "these competing effects have opposite scalings with the optical field intensity .",
    "increasing the intensity to enhance the measurement strength and decrease shot noise results normally in increased measurement backaction , so that the route to improved force sensitivity requires therefore the mitigation or elimination of measurement backaction .",
    "early proposals to achieve that goal relied on the insight that force sensitivity could be improved by measuring only a single quadrature of motion so as to isolate the effect of measurement backaction on the unseen orthogonal quadrature  @xcite .",
    "such schemes are most conveniently realized by a temporal modulation of the electromagnetic field , as demonstrated in ref .",
    "generalizations of backaction - evading measurements to multimode systems have also been proposed  @xcite .",
    "more recently a different approach to beyond - sql measurements has been introduced .",
    "the idea is to introduce an ` anti - noise ' path in the dynamics of the optomechanical system via the addition of another oscillator that exhibits an equal and opposite response to the electromagnetic field , that is , an oscillator with a negative effective mass  @xcite .",
    "such an interaction realizes a coherent cancellation of measurement backaction via quantum interference  @xcite .",
    "an early proposal focused on the use of an ancilla cavity that is red - detuned from the optomechanical cavity , a quantum non - demolition coupling of the electromagnetic fields within the two cavities yielding the necessary anti - noise effect  @xcite .",
    "however , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the technical requirements of this optical approach to cqnc pose prohibitive challenges , especially for low frequency mechanical resonators with large quality factors , the regime most relevant to force sensing applications .    the coupling of optomechanical systems to the internal or external degrees of freedom of atomic ensembles has previously been shown to improve optomechanical cooling  @xcite , opening the possibility of ground state cooling outside the resolved sideband regime @xcite , and preliminary experimental results have confirmed the validity of that hybrid approach @xcite .",
    "in addition , the interaction between mechanical resonators and atomic ensembles may be used to produce squeezed states , epr - correlated states and entanglement @xcite .",
    "this motivates considering hybrid systems that combine optomechanical resonators with the best features of atomic ( or atom - like ) systems to develop experimentally feasible approaches to cqnc  @xcite .",
    "a related approach has been experimentally shown to yield high sensitivity for coupled atomic oscillators @xcite .    with these considerations in mind , this paper studies theoretically a cqnc scheme based on a dual cavity hybrid atom - optomechanical system where",
    "a mechanical oscillator used for force sensing is coupled to an ultracold atomic ensemble trapped in a separate cavity and serving as a negative mass oscillator .",
    "this arrangement is a modification of the setup proposed for hybrid cooling  @xcite , the modular approach allowing to independently optimize the cavities for the mechanics and for the atoms .",
    "importantly , we find that the interaction between the optomechanical cavity and the atomic ensemble can significantly alleviate the requirements for cqnc , and yields dramatic improvements in force sensitivity for parameters that have already been experimentally demonstrated .",
    "in addition , by rapidly modifying the external fields that control the atomic system it is possible to combine the spin - mediated optomechanical cooling of the mechanics with cqnc , thereby using the atomic ensemble both as a resource for state preparation and for force sensing deep into the quantum regime ,    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii introduces the model of the system and derives the equation of motions for the relevant dynamical variables involved in the sensing process , which is discussed in detail in section iii .",
    "section iv turns to force sensing , and computes the sensitivity limit of the atom - based cqnc scheme .",
    "finally section v is a summary and outlook . in appendix",
    ", we show briefly how to combine the sensing scheme with hybrid cooling of the mechanics for realistic experimental parameters .",
    "we consider a dual - cavity hybrid system , with one cavity  the optomechanical resonator  containing the mechanical oscillator acting as a force sensor , and the other  the ` atomic cavity '  containing a trapped ultracold atomic ensemble driven by the intracavity field and a classical control field .",
    "the two cavities are coupled coherently by their outcoupled fields , for example via an optical fiber link , see  fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] .",
    "the total hamiltonian comprises contributions from the intracavity fields , @xmath0 , the optomechanical interaction , @xmath1 , the atom - field coupling , @xmath2 , the external driving of the cavities and dissipation , @xmath3 , and the forces to be measured , @xmath4 , @xmath5    we take the optical cavities as single mode and model their coupling via a coherent tunneling term  @xcite , so that @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the annihilation operators for the atomic and optomechanical cavity field mode , respectively , and we take their frequencies to be equal , @xmath9 .",
    "the tunneling term @xmath10 is a function of the dissipation rates @xmath11 and @xmath12 of these cavities .",
    "its explicit form depends on the specific geometry  @xcite .",
    "as will become more apparent in the next section it is useful to diagonalize @xmath0 in terms of the symmetric and antisymmetric modes of the coupled cavity system @xmath13 as @xmath14    the optomechanical hamiltonian @xmath1 describes the dynamics of a mode of vibration of the mechanics with effective mass @xmath15 and resonant frequency @xmath16 .",
    "in the absence of external force acting on it , @xmath17 , it is driven by the radiation pressure of the intracavity field @xmath18 , @xmath19 here @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the position and momentum of the mechanical mode , normalized to its zero point motion @xmath22 and momentum @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the single photon optomechanical coupling .    turning now to the hamiltonian @xmath25 , we consider an ensemble of @xmath26 ultracold atoms interacting non - resonantly with the intracavity field @xmath27 and a classical control field of rabi frequency @xmath28 and frequency @xmath29 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme](b ) .",
    "we assume that the excited states @xmath30 and @xmath31 are sufficiently off - resonant that they can be adiabatically eliminated and the dynamics is restricted to two raman - coupled levels @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the hyperfine ground state manifold .",
    "the light - atom coupling reduces then the coupled double-@xmath34 system to an effective two - state system driven by a faraday interaction  @xcite .",
    "we further assume that a static external magnetic field tunes the zeeman splitting between these states into resonance with the frequency @xmath16 of the mechanical resonator and that the atoms are initially pumped in the hyperfine level of higher energy , @xmath33 , resulting in an inverted ensemble that is well approximated for large @xmath26 by a harmonic oscillator of negative effective mass .    introducing the collective operator @xmath35 where @xmath36 labels the different atoms , these approximations result in the effective hamiltonian @xmath37 or , in terms of the symmetric and antisymmetric modes , @xmath38 .",
    "\\label{eq : hat}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath39 is the collective raman coupling between the atomic levels , with @xmath40 being the cavity mode rabi frequency , @xmath28 the rabi frequency of the control field , and @xmath41 the detuning of the control beam from the excited atomic states",
    ".    finally , @xmath3 accounts for the system interaction with its environment , including the dissipation of mechanics , cavities , and atoms as well as external pumping of the cavity modes with a laser of frequency @xmath42 , and @xmath4 accounts for the coupling of the mechanics to the external forces to be measured .",
    "the usual way to enhance the optomechanical interaction @xmath24 is to drive the optomechanical resonator with a classical light field .",
    "however , because the two resonators are coupled it is important to do so while preserving the polarization of the atomic ensemble , so that it still behaves as an effective harmonic oscillator of negative mass .",
    "one way to satisfy these apparently conflicting requirements is to exploit the frequency splitting @xmath43 between the symmetric and antisymmetric modes @xmath44 and @xmath45 of the coupled cavities system . specifically , we pump the system at the frequency @xmath46 of the antisymmetric mode and measure the signal via a standard heterodyne detection scheme at the frequency @xmath47 of the symmetric mode  @xcite .",
    "we further select which optical mode interacts with the atoms by adjusting the frequency @xmath48 of the control field that sets the raman two - photon resonance condition .",
    "it is easily verified that for @xmath49 the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hat ] ) becomes resonant .",
    "invoking in addition the rotating wave approximation we can ignore the small contribution due to the off - resonant third term in that equation , so that @xmath50    the external pumping of the optomechanical resonator results in a small but finite displacement of the mechanics , which induces some degree of cross - talk between the modes @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "this leads in turn to a finite occupation of mode @xmath51 which then drives some atomic population from the excited hyperfine level @xmath53 to @xmath54 , resulting in a deterioration of the atomic polarization .",
    "this effect can be compensated by applying an external static force on the mechanical resonator to counterbalance the displacement due to radiation pressure .",
    "this force can be finely tuned by monitoring the atomic polarization via a fluorescence measurement of the population of state @xmath32 , which vanishes when the mechanical displacement is fully compensated .    while both the symmetric and antisymmetric mode couple to the mechanics , the resulting sidebands at frequencies @xmath55 and",
    "@xmath56 are well separated and it is possible to filter out the small contribution of the off - resonant , anti - symmetric mode from the total hamiltonian . linearizing the resulting hamiltonian around",
    "the steady state gives , in the frame rotating at the pumping frequency @xmath57 , @xmath58 where @xmath59 @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 is the same as @xmath63 , but in a frame rotating at the frequency @xmath57 .",
    "the resulting heisenberg - langevin equations of motion are @xmath64 where we have taken the two cavities to have the same decay rate , @xmath65 , with associated noise operators @xmath66 and @xmath67  @xcite .",
    "the dissipation rate of the mechanics is @xmath68 , with noise operator @xmath69 , and the atomic coherence between the hyperfine states @xmath70 and @xmath54 decays at rate @xmath71 , with noise operators @xmath72 and @xmath73 . finally @xmath74 is the ( classical ) external force to be measured .",
    "it is normalized to @xmath75 and thus expressed in units of @xmath76 .",
    "since we are in the frame rotating at @xmath57 , the sensing mode @xmath51 appears to have an effective frequency @xmath43 .",
    "these equations are similar to those describing the coherent quantum noise cancellation scheme proposed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "as will be clear in the next section , in that latter case the role of the atoms is played instead by an ancilla cavity , and a crucial requirement is that this cavity be in the resolved sideband regime .",
    "the stringent requirement on the dissipation in the present scheme is passed onto the atoms : we have to match the mechanical dissipation with the rate of atomic decoherence , with @xmath77 , a condition that is relatively easy to satisfy @xcite .",
    "because of the dependence of the quadrature @xmath78 on the position @xmath79 of the mechanics , which is in turn coupled to its momentum @xmath80 one can detect that external force by monitoring the symmetric mode @xmath44 , for instance via a hetrodyne measurement .",
    "we turn to the frequency domain in order to solve the dynamics of the relevant variables with respect to the input noise sources .",

    "finally the last line describes the backaction on @xmath78 of the conjugate variable @xmath88 .",
    "the key point , and the essence of cqnc , is that for @xmath89 and @xmath90 the contributions to measurement backaction from the mechanics and from the atoms cancel each other for all frequencies .",
    "they can then be thought of as noise and antinoise contributions to the signal .",
    "this is the reason behind the need to create an oscillator with a negative effective mass in the atomic system .",
    "note that these conditions also eliminate one of the terms from the susceptibility @xmath91 , see eq .",
    "( [ chi ] ) . by matching the interaction strength of the field with both the mechanics and the atoms ( @xmath89 ) and by arranging for the atomic coherence and the mechanical resonator to have the same dissipation rates ( @xmath92 ) one can",

    "in addition , if the mechanics has a quality factor high enough that @xmath93 one can also eliminate the last term in the denominator of the atomic susceptibility ( [ eq : at_susc ] ) to achieve perfect coherent backaction noise cancellation .    to obtain the relationship between the force to be detected @xmath74 and the measured phase quadrature we rewrite eq .",

    "( [ sfadd ] ) , in contrast , the term proportional to @xmath104 is missing , indicating the successful elimination of measurement backaction . however , an immediate observation is that the cancellation of the back - action term occurs at the cost of an additional shot - noise - type term that is independent of the measurement strength @xmath104 .",
