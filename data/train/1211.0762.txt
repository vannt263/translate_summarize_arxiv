    "three - dimensional topological insulators ( tis ) are new states of quantum matter with helical gapless surface states consisting of odd number of dirac cones inside the bulk band gap protected by time - reversal symmetry ( trs).@xcite the underlying physical origin of the topological property of tis is the strong spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , which plays a similar role as the lorentz force in the quantum hall state . due to the soc interaction , the",
    "spin and momentum are locked to each other , forming a spin texture in the momentum space for the surface states of tis@xcite .",
    "the spin texture has been directly observed in the spin - resolved angle - resolved photon emission spectroscopy ( spin - resolved arpes)@xcite .",
    "the spin texture gives rise to a non - trivial berry phase for the topological surface states and suppresses the backscatterings under trs , leading to possible device applications in spintronics .",
    "besides the spin texture , it has also been shown recently that the atomic @xmath5 orbitals of the bi@xmath0se@xmath1 family of topological insulators form a pattern in the momentum space , dubbed as the orbital texture , for the topological surface states.@xcite in this work , we predict a coupled spin - orbital texture for the topological surface states . based on both the effective * k@xmath6 p * theory and _ ab - initio _ calculations , we find , besides the usual locking between the electron spin and the crystal momentum , the spin texture is also locked to the atomic orbital texture , which is dubbed as `` spin - orbital texture '' .",
    "we show that @xmath7 orbitals have left - handed spin texture for the upper dirac cone and right - handed spin texture for the lower dirac cone , sharing the same feature as the total spin texture of the surface states .",
    "in contrast , the in - plane orbitals ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 orbitals ) reveal more intriguing features : for the upper dirac cone of surface states , a `` radial '' orbital texture is coupled to a left - handed spin texture and a `` tangential '' orbital texture is coupled to a right - handed spin texture . for the lower dirac cone , the coupling between spin and orbital textures is exactly opposite .",
    "an electron spin - resolved and photon polarized arpes experiment is proposed to observe this novel spin - orbital texture of the surface states of tis .",
    "the surface states of tis are described by the dirac type of effective hamiltonian@xcite @xmath10 with the fermi velocity @xmath11 and pauli matrix @xmath12 .",
    "the salient feature of this effective hamiltonian is the `` spin - momentum locking '' , which means for a fixed momentum * k * , the `` spin '' , denoted by the pauli matrix @xmath12 , has a fixed direction for the eigenstate of the hamiltonian .",
    "since the `` spin '' is always perpendicular to the momentum , we can introduce a helicity operator , defined as @xmath13 which commutates with the hamiltonian , to determine the handness of the `` spin '' texture .",
    "for the upper dirac cone of surface states , the helical operator @xmath14 , leading to a left - handed `` spin '' texture in the momentum space while for the lower dirac cone , @xmath15 yields a a right - handed `` spin '' texture .",
    "however , one should note that here the `` spin '' is not the real spin , but the total angular momentum @xmath16 , which is a combination of the real spin @xmath17 and the orbital angular momentum @xmath18 due to soc .",
    "consequently , the basis of the surface effective hamiltonian ( [ eq : sur_heff ] ) are denoted as @xmath19 with the lower indices @xmath20 representing the total angular momentum along @xmath21 direction . in order to understand what is the texture for the real spin @xmath17 , it is necessary to write down the explicit form of the basis wavefunction @xmath22 .",
    "the form of the basis @xmath22 can be constructed by symmetry considerations .",
    "generally the basis @xmath22 depends on the momentum * k * and we can expand it up to the first order in * k * as @xmath23 .",
    "here we are only interested in the @xmath5 orbitals of bi and se atoms in the topological insulator bi@xmath0se@xmath1 and can decompose the zeroth - order wavefunction as @xmath24 %    & & |\\psi^{(0)}_{\\frac{1}{2}}\\rangle=\\sum_\\alpha \\left[u_{0,\\alpha}|\\alpha , p_z,\\uparrow\\rangle+v_{0,\\alpha}|\\alpha , p_+,\\downarrow\\rangle \\right]\\nonumber\\\\   %    & & |\\psi^{(0)}_{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\rangle=\\sum_\\alpha \\left[u_{0,\\alpha}|\\alpha , p_z,\\downarrow\\rangle+ v_{0,\\alpha}|\\alpha , p_-,\\uparrow\\rangle \\right ]      \\label{eq : surwf0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the first - order wavefunction as @xmath25 \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote the spin , @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote different @xmath31 orbitals , and @xmath32 denotes indices other than the spin and orbital , such as atom indices . here",

    "furthermore , for the upper dirac cone , the radial orbital texture @xmath45 is always coupled to the left - handed spin texture @xmath43 and the tangential orbital texture @xmath46 is always coupled to the right - handed spin texture @xmath44 .",

    "the blue arrows represent the spin texture , where the spin is mainly lying in plane near the dirac point . the spin texture is left - handed for the upper dirac cone and right - handed for the lower one , the same as the total angular momentum texture . to understand the underlying physics",

    "the amplitude of @xmath8 and @xmath9 orbitals for the surface states is not isotropic , but has @xmath61 angular dependence around the fermi surface , as shown in fig .",
    "we may take the difference of the amplitudes between @xmath8 and @xmath9 orbitals , as shown by colors in fig .",
    "4a , b . here",
    "more red means more @xmath8 character , and more blue means more @xmath9 character .",
    "the angular dependence indicates a tangential orbital texture for the upper dirac cone and a radial orbital texture for the lower dirac cone , as schematically shown by the inset of fig .",
    "4a , b , respectively .",
    "this orbital texture was experimentally observed recently@xcite .",
    "furthermore , we also plot the total spin textures for in - plane orbitals on the same figure , which show a right - handed texture for both upper and lower dirac cones . all these salient feature can be understood by the wavefunctions ( [ eq : eigenwf1 ] ) and ( [ eq : eigenwf2 ] ) . for the upper dirac cone ,",
    "although both @xmath62 and @xmath63 terms exist in the wavefunction ( [ eq : eigenwf1 ] ) , their associated coefficients are unequal .",
    "when @xmath64 , @xmath63 term dominates over @xmath62 term , dominantly giving a tangential orbital texture coupled to a right - handed spin texture .",
    "similarly , for the lower dirac cone , when @xmath65 , @xmath66 term in the wavefunction ( [ eq : eigenwf2 ] ) is dominant , yielding a radial orbital texture coupled to a right - handed spin texture .",
    "the difference between @xmath8 and @xmath9 orbitals can be calculated directly as @xmath67 $ ] , which indeed shows a @xmath61 angular dependence , and the total spin textures for in - plane orbitals can be obtained as @xmath68=[d^\\pm_{p_x , x}+d^\\pm_{p_y , x},d^\\pm_{p_x , y}+d^\\pm_{p_y , y}]=4[-\\sin\\theta_k,\\cos\\theta_k]\\sum_\\alpha ( v_{0,\\alpha}\\mp ku_{1,\\alpha})kw_{1,\\alpha}$ ] , which shows a right - handed spin texture when @xmath69 .",

    "4a , b .",
    "therefore , there is a transition from a tangential orbital texture in the upper dirac cone to a radial orbital texture in the lower dirac cone , switching exactly at the dirac point . to quantitatively describe this transition",
    ", we introduce a polarization quantity @xmath71 with ` @xmath57 ' for upper and lower dirac cones .",
    "the plot of @xmath72 is shown in fig .",
    "4d where the energy level of the dirac point is shifted to zero .",
    "in order to show the plot more visually , we reverse the value of the @xmath73 for the upper dirac cone plotted with the red .",
    "the feature of @xmath72 undoubtedly indicates that the state of the lower dirac cone forms a radial orbital texture , and the state of the upper dirac cone forms a tangential orbital texture . the dirac point is shown to be the exact transition point from the tangential to radial orbital texture",

    "although in - plane orbitals show different spin textures compared to @xmath7 orbitals , we stress the @xmath7 orbitals ( @xmath77 ) dominate the states near the dirac point with @xmath8 and @xmath9 only around @xmath78 . therefore , the spin texture for the whole states show left - handed for the upper dirac cone and right - handed for the lower dirac cone , the same as that of @xmath7 orbitals , as well as the total angular momentum texture .",
    "in order to detect the spin texture of electrons , the spin - resolved arpes technology has been developed by taking advantage of spin - dependent scatting processes and precisely measuring the magnitude of the asymmetry in the spin - dependent intensity with perfect spin - polarimeters.@xcite the non - trivial spin texture of surface states of tis has been clearly observed by experiments.@xcite in addition , the orbital character can be detected through the photon polarization selection rules@xcite based on the symmetry analysis . with this technology ,",
