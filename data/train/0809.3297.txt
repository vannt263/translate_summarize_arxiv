    "in addition to these observations , several nights equivalent of observations as well as archival observations using the espadons spectropolarimeter ( r=68,000 ) on the 3.6 m canada - france - hawaii telescope were used to supplement the survey .",
    "the initial results focused on the h@xmath2 line in several classes of star .",
    "initially , well - known bright stars for close study but the target list was expanded to include many stellar types including classical be , herbig ae / be , post - agb , rv - tau and other bright emission - line stars . the h@xmath2 line in these stars is typically an emission line with additional absorptive components . stars with p - cygni profiles showed strong variability of the absorptive component of the line .    the main observational results of the survey have been presented in harrington 2008 and harrington & kuhn 2007 , 2008b and c. in 10/30 be type stars , the traditional broad depolarization morphology was found . however , at high spectral resolution some additional polarimetric effects were seen in the absorptive components of 4 of these 10 stars . in the herbig",
    "ae / be stars roughly 2/3 of the stars with strong absorptive components ( 14/20 with either central or blue - shifted absorption ) showed clear spectropolarimetric signatures .",
    "the detected effects were centered on absorptive components of the line and was typically confined to the wavelengths corresponding to strong absorption .",
    "the magnitude was typically 0.3% to 2% with some signatures being variable in time .",
    "post - agb and rv - tau type evolved stars also showed ubiquitous strong absorptive polarimetric effects ( 5/6 pagb and 4/4 rvtau ) very similar to the herbig ae / be stars .",
    "figure 1 shows examples of the absorptive polarization effects in herbig ae / be stars , post - agb stars and classical be stars .",
    "these observations were inconsistent with the traditional scattering models . both the disk scattering and depolarization models produce broad spectropolarimetric profiles , not profiles confined to absorptive components .",
    "this inspired the development of a new explanation of the observed polarization ( kuhn et al . 2007 ) based on optical - pumping .",
    "the disk - scattering and depolarization models predict signatures centered on the h@xmath2 line .",
    "the disk - scattering signature must broader than the emission as the effect comes from the doppler - redistribution of the emission line ( wood et al .",
    "1993 , vink et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this is illustrated in the left panel of figure 2 .",
    "the depolarization model has the emission dilute a polarized continuum producing an effect at least as wide as the emission . in almost all of our stars , the effect occurred in and around the absorptive component with the morphology being dominated by the polarization in the absorptive component .",
    "the polarization of the emission peak and of the line wings was nearly identical to the continuum polarization in most stars .",
    "this problem led us to explore an alternative explanations that has the absorbing material also be the polarizing material .",
    "optical pumping is a very robust phenomena used in the lab for decades that produces polarized absorption in strongly irradiated environments ( happer 1972 ) .",
    "we developed a new model where the anisotropic stellar radiation causes the absorbing material to polarize the transmitted light ( kuhn et al .",
    "the key difference between this optical pumping model and the scattering model is that only the absorbing material is responsible for the changing polarization , whereas the scattering models require scattered light from the entire circumstellar region producing polarization effects across the entire line .",
    "an example of an optical pumping calculation is shown in the right panel of figure 2 from kuhn et al .",
    "the calculation shows the polarization for an orbiting or outflowing cloud obscuring the photosphere of a star as a function of it s projected radial velocity .",
    "this new model is simple , deterministic and produces polarization in absorption as we have observed in several classes of star .",
    "this program was supported by the nsf ast-0123390 grant , the university of hawaii and the airforce research labs .",
    "some of this research used the facilities of the canadian astronomy data centre operated by the national research council of canada with the support of the canadian space agency .",
