    "the anti - matter particles such as positrons and antiprotons in cosmic rays ( crs ) are very important in understanding the origin and propagation of crs .",
    "these particles are usually produced by the cr nuclei that interact with the interstellar medium ( ism ) when propagating in the interstellar space .",
    "precise measurements of these particles will provide us valuable information about the primary cr sources and the interaction with matter .",
    "in addition , these secondary anti - matter particles have relative lower fluxes and characteristic spectra . therefore they make themselves good objects to study the exotic origin of crs , such as from dark matter ( dm ) annihilation or decay .",
    "recently the pamela collaboration released their first cr measurements on the positron fraction @xcite and @xmath4 ratio @xcite .",
    "the positron fraction of pamela data shows an uprise above @xmath5 gev till to @xmath6 gev , which exceeds the background estimation of the conventional cr propagation model .",
    "this result is consistent with previous measurements by , e.g. , heat @xcite and ams @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath4 ratio is compatible with the background .",
    "the results of pamela strongly indicate the existence of such sources that mainly generate leptonic particles at this energy range .",
    "the electron spectrum up to several tev reported by atic collaboration also shows an obvious excess with an interesting bump around @xmath7 gev @xcite .",
    "in addition , the measurements of the electron spectrum by ppb - bets @xcite , h.e.s.s .",
    "@xcite , and most recently by fermi @xcite all show the excesses of electron spectra , although they are not fully consistent between each other .",
    "the studies show that the pamela result on the positron fraction is consistent with the electron spectrum measured by atic or fermi assuming the equal amount of the production of positrons and electrons ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one possible primary electron / positron source in the galaxy is the pulsar .",
    "pulsars and their nebulae are well known cosmic particle accelerators .",
    "although the quantitative details of the acceleration processes are still open for study , early radio observations have established them as important high energy cosmic electron and positron sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray and @xmath3-ray observations show that some of the accelerated particles can reach an energy of a few tens of tev , and there are indications that the particle distribution cuts off in the tev energy range ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these particles produce emission over a broadband frequency range in the source region , which has been observed and studied extensively ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". some of these particles will escape into the ism becoming high energy cosmic electrons and positrons .",
    "it is shown that one or several nearby pulsars will be able to contribute enough positrons to reproduce the pamela data @xcite as well as atic data @xcite .",
    "another potential candidate , which has been widely discussed to solve the positron / electron excess problem , is the dm annihilation ( e.g. , @xcite ) or decay ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "it has been shown in many studies that the local measurements of the electrons / positrons can not provide enough power to discriminate the dm origin and the pulsar origin of the electrons / positrons .",
    "on one hand , the atic data suggest a sharp cutoff near @xmath8 gev .",
    "such a feature can naturally appear for a dm origin when closing to the mass of dm particle , if the dm annihilates or decays directly to e@xmath9e@xmath10 pair , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , the same thing is also expected if the observed excess is dominated by a single pulsar and/or its nebula and the accelerated high energy electrons and positrons have experienced significant energy loss as they propagate in the source and in the ism @xcite .",
    "the narrow peak resulting from local pulsars is even indistinguishable from that of dm origin @xcite . on the other hand , if the electron spectrum is as smooth as that from fermi , there are also degeneracies between the pulsar and dm interpretations",
    ". a continuously distributed pulsar population in the galaxy might be able to generate smoother electron spectrum due to different energy losses of various pulsars .",
    "while for the dm scenario , if the electrons and positrons come from dm annihilation or decay , the spectrum can also be smooth , and is consistent with the fermi measurements @xcite .    in this work we study the photon emission associated with the different scenarios to see how the degeneracies between these models can be broken .",
    "our point is that although the different scenarios can give almost the same local electrons / positrons , the spatial extrapolations of them might be significantly different , especially in the galactic center ( gc ) region .",
    "the pulsars mainly concentrate in the galactic plane , while the dm is spherically distributed in an extended halo and highly concentrated in the center of the halo . in addition , dm annihilation is proportional to @xmath11 , different from that of dm decay ( @xmath12 )",
    ". therefore we anticipate the existence of remarkable differences in the skymaps of the synchrotron and inverse compton ( ic ) emission from these extra primary electrons / positrons for the three scenarios .",
    "we compare the differences of synchrotron as well as ic radiation among the pulsars , annihilating dm and decaying dm models , on the premise that they all reproduce the positron fraction and total electron + positron flux data .",
    "the spectral and directional features of the radiation are discussed in detail .",
    "we compare the results with the wmap haze data @xcite and egret diffuse @xmath3-ray data @xcite , and give the observable signals by future experiments such as fermi / glast .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "@xmath21 is the momentum loss rate , mainly induced by synchrotron radiation and ic scattering for the electrons / positrons for energies @xmath2 gev @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we use the numerical package galprop @xcite to calculate the propagation of the primary electrons / positrons and the background crs .",
    "we have adopted the conventional propagation model where all the cr data are reproduced by the model .",
    "the cosmic nuclei secondary to primary ratio , such as b / c , the unstable secondary to stable secondary , such as @xmath22be/@xmath23be , and the local proton and electron spectra are taken to constrain the propagation parameters .",
    "a conventional diffusion + convection ( dc ) propagation model @xcite is adopted . for details of the propagation model",
    "see the discussion in ref .",
    "the propagation parameters are taken as : half height of the propagation halo @xmath24 kpc ; diffusion coefficient @xmath25 with @xmath26@xmath27s@xmath28 , @xmath29 for rigidity @xmath30 gv and @xmath31 for @xmath32 gv ; the convection velocity is adopted as a linear function of coordinate @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 km s@xmath28 kpc@xmath28 . the reacceleration is not included .",
    "the source term @xmath15 is different for various scenarios . for dm annihilation , the source function of electrons / positrons has the form @xmath36 where bf represents the `` boost factor '' which can come from the clumpiness of dm substructures ( e.g. , @xcite ) and/or the so - called sommerfeld effect @xcite . in the former case ,",

    "this model is actually similar with the so - called conventional model @xcite , which fits all the pre - fermi cr data and is also successfully used to model the diffuse gamma - ray spectrum measured by fermi at intermediate galactic latitudes @xcite .",
    "finally we should point out that we take continuous distribution of the sources ( pulsar or dm ) to recover the pamela and atic / fermi data in this work .",
    "note that it is also possible that the locally observed electrons / positrons come from one or several nearby pulsars @xcite or dm clumps @xcite .",
    "for the pulsar scenario , this assumption does not affect the discussion since the extrapolation to the whole galaxy will hold regardless of how much the far pulsars can contribute to the local electron flux .",

    "the density profile is given as @xmath110 with @xmath111 kpc and the local dm density @xmath47 gev @xmath48 at @xmath49kpc . with the same local density @xmath112 ,",
    "the cored isothermal profile is the least cuspied distribution .",
    "thus we anticipate it will produce the weakest photon signals at the gc .",
    "we show in figure [ isothermal ] the synchrotron spectra within a bin size of @xmath89 around the gc and the diffuse @xmath3-ray spectra around the gc for cored isothermal dm profile compared with the pulsar model and the background .",
    "it is shown the differences between these models indeed become smaller compared with that given in figure [ spectra ] .",
    "the results shown in figure [ isothermal ] could be taken as the lower limit of our prediction , if other related models and parameters are fixed .",
    "any other dm density profile will lead to a more clear discrimination of these predictions . in this conservative case with cored isothermal profile",
    ", it might be not easy to discriminate the dm signals .",
    "another source of uncertainties of our prediction comes from the propagation models . actually requiring the propagation model to reproduce all the cr data gives strong constraints on the propagation parameters .",
    "the secondary to primary ratio , such as b / c , the unstable secondary to stable secondary , such as @xmath22be/@xmath113be , and the local proton , electron data are used to determine these parameters ( see the discussion of the propagation model in ref @xcite ) . under these requirement our results given in the previous sections will not change much by adjusting the propagation parameters , since the propagation models give similar descriptions to all kinds of crs .",
    "once other species satisfy data the model should also give similar electron and positron distributions at the same time .",
    "we will explicitly show the expectation in the following .    in the previous sections we adopt the conventional model that all the cosmic ray spectra are consistent with observations .",
    "we have ignored the effect of reacceleration in eq .",
    "( [ prop ] ) and kept the effect of convection , which leads to better fit to the pamela data at low energies @xcite .",
    "we will show in the following the propagation parameters will modify our results very slightly .        as an example we give the synchrotron spectra for diffusion + reacceleration ( dr ) propagation model adopting the same propagation parameters as in @xcite , which , contrary to the propagation model adopted in the present work , keeps the effect of reacceleration while ignores the effect of convection . in figure",
    "[ dr ] we plot the synchrotron spectra in the dr propagation model for the three scenarios to account for the pamela and atic data .",
    "we see that these results are almost the same as the prediction in the dc model shown in the left panel of figure [ spectra ] .",
    "another important uncertainty of propagation model comes from the height of the diffusion region .",
    "we have studied a propagation model with diffusion height 2kpc .",
    "the propagation parameters are also adjusted to reproduce all the cosmic ray observations . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ dr ] we show the synchrotron predictions in this 2kpc diffuse halo height propagation model .",
    "we see that the change of propagation parameters generally affect our predictions slightly .",
    "the synchrotron and ic radiation directly depend on the magnetic field and isrf respectively .",
    "the galprop model has adopted the latest result of the magnetic field and isrf , which are given according to the most recent astronomical observations .",
    "to fully figure out the uncertainties of these astronomical observations is not easy .",
    "however , taking these uncertainties into account will not change our conclusion in this work , since the change will affect all the three scenarios simultaneously .",
    "for example the strength of the magnetic field may have the uncertainty of a factor @xmath114 . to reduce the magnetic field",
    "twice will reduce all the synchrotron radiation of the three scenarios , together with the background , twice .",
    "this is equivalent to say that all the curves in the synchrotron plots should shift downwards , while the relative differences between these models are not changed .",
    "similarly change of isrf will shift the ic radiation for all the three scenarios at the same time .",
    "however , observations of radio or diffuse @xmath3-rays by egret and fermi especially at high latitude will constrain the magnetic field or isrf that can not be too small .",
    "to explain the recent measurements of the positron fraction by pamela and electron spectrum by atic , fermi and hess , several scenarios including the dm and pulsars are proposed . in this paper",
    "we studied the perspective to discriminate these models using the synchrotron and ic radiation generated by these electrons / positrons .",
    "the point is that although various kinds of models degenerate in the local environment kpc @xcite . ] and give similar electrons / positrons spectra , their different spatial extension might be revealed by the accompanied photon emission .    by properly adjusting the model parameters we first build three benchmark models which can reproduce the measured electron / positron data .",
    "we then studied the synchrotron and ic radiation from these primary electrons and positrons .",
    "we find that around the gc region , the synchrotron spectra for frequencies from @xmath115 mhz and the ic @xmath3-ray spectra from several gev to several hundred gev are significantly different among the three scenarios , especially between annihilating dm scenario and others .",
    "for the directional profiles , the dm models show larger gradient near the gc , especially in the longitude profiles , than the pulsar model and the background .",
    "the photon emissions for pulsar model are very small and similar with the background , and will be the most difficult one to be detected . while for dm models , especially the annihilating dm model , there are strong observable signals .",
    "finally we discuss the possible uncertainties of these conclusions .",
    "the major uncertainty comes from the dm inner profile . for the most conservative case with cored isothermal dm profile ,",
    "the signals of dm scenarios become weaker and might be hard to be discriminated .",
    "however , the isothermal profile is generally disfavored by numerical simulations . other uncertainties , such as the dm annihilation or decay channels , the propagation parameters and other astrophysical inputs , seems not to change the relative differences among the signals of the three scenarios significantly .",
    "it should be pointed out that in this work the boost factor for the annihilating dm scenario is assumed to be universal , such as the sommerfeld effect .",
    "it is also possible that the boost effect is spatially dependent , e.g. , from the dm subhalos @xcite .",
    "if so , the enhancement near the gc region will not be as important as at large radius in the halo .",
    "actually , the calculation based on the n - body simulation indicates that the boost factor from dm substructure for anti - matter particles from dm annihilation in the galaxy is generally negligible @xcite .",
    "a recent calculation on the dm clumpiness boost factor taking into account the sommerfeld effect still finds no remarkable enhancement effect , except for fine tuning to the strongly resonant case @xcite .",
    "therefore the conclusions in this work are generally held .",
    "we thank prof .",
