    "however , many applications require `` custom - built '' frames that possess additional properties which are dictated by these applications . as a result",
    ", the construction of frames with prescribed structures has been actively pursued .",
    "for instance , a special class called _ finite unit norm tight frames _ ( funtfs ) that provide a parseval - type representation very similar to orthonormal bases , has been customized to model data transmissions @xcite . since then the characterization and construction of funtfs and",
    "some of their generalizations have received a lot of attention @xcite . beyond their use in applications ,",
    "funtfs are also related to some deep open problems in pure mathematics such as the kadison - singer conjecture @xcite .",
    "funtfs appear also in statistics where , for instance , tyler used them to construct @xmath2-estimators of multivariate scatter @xcite .",
    "we elaborate more on the connection between the @xmath2-estimators and funtfs in remark  [ remark : m estimator funtf ] .",
    "these @xmath2-estimators were subsequently used to construct maximum likelihood estimators for the the wrapped cauchy distribution on the circle in @xcite and for the angular central gaussian distribution on the sphere in @xcite .",
    "funtfs are exactly the minimizers of a functional called the frame potential @xcite .",
    "this was extended to characterize all finite tight frames in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite , finite tight frames with a convolutional structure , which can be used to model filter banks , have been characterized as minimizers of an appropriate potential .",
    "all these potentials are connected to other functionals whose extremals have long been investigated in various settings .",
    "we refer to @xcite for details and related results .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study objects beyond both funtfs and the frame potential .",
    "in fact , we consider a family of functionals , the _",

    "these potentials have been studied in the context of spherical @xmath6-designs for even integers @xmath3 , cf .",
    "seidel in @xcite , and their minimizers are not just funtfs but funtfs that inherit additional properties and structure .",
    "common funtfs are recovered only for @xmath7 . in the process , we extend seidel s results on spherical @xmath6-designs in @xcite to the entire range of positive real @xmath3",
    ".    in section  [ section : estimates ] , we give lower estimates on the @xmath3-frame potentials , and prove that in certain cases their minimizers are funtfs , which possess additional properties and structure .",

    "moreover , when @xmath11 and @xmath12 , we characterize the minimizers of the @xmath3-frame potentials , under a technical condition , which , we have only been able to establish when @xmath13 . we conjecture that this technical condition holds when @xmath14 .",

    "we characterize the minimizers of _",
    "probabilistic @xmath3-frame potentials _ in terms of probabilistic @xmath3-frames .",
    "the latter problem is solved completely for @xmath12 , and for all even integers @xmath3 . in particular , these last results generalize @xcite as well as the recently introduced notion of the probabilistic frame potential in @xcite .    * further relations to statistics : * besides the results on funtfs used in @xcite , and mentioned above , frame theory has essentially evolved independently of statistical fields such as statistical shape analysis @xcite and directional statistics @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there still exist several overlaps , and to the best of our knowledge , these overlaps have not yet been fully explored .",
    "recently , frame theory has been used in directional statistics @xcite , where funtfs are utilized to investigate on statistical tests for directional uniformity and to model and analyze patterns found in granular rod experiments .",
    "we must point out that similar results were obtained earlier by tyler in @xcite .",
    "probabilistic tight frames are multivariate probability distributions whose second moments matrix is a multiple of the identity , and they are used in @xcite to obtain approximate funtfs .",
    "the latter approximation procedure is connected to a classical problem in multivariate statistics , namely estimating the population covariance from a sample , which is closely related to the @xmath2-estimators addressed in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3-frame potentials and their probabilistic counterparts that we consider in the sequel , are linked to the notion of shape measure , shape space , and mean shape used in statistical shape analysis . in section [ label : section p frame potential ] , we establish a precise connection between the full procrustes estimate of mean shape ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 3.3 ) which is the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the frame operator .",
    "moreover , this eigenvalue coincides with the upper frame redundancy as introduced in @xcite .",

    "moreover , the @xmath3-frame potentials form size measures as required in statistical shape analysis , and their minimizers among all collections of @xmath15 points on the sphere define a shape space modulo rotations .",
