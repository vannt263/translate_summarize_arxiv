    "the star  is an f6iv star located 15.6  pc away @xcite that is orbited by a planet with a minimum mass of  4.14  m@xmath3 ( jovian masses ) orbiting in a 3.3  day period ( semi - major axis of  0.047  , * ? ? ?",
    "by analogy to the `` magnetic planets '' in the solar system ( , , , , and ) , there have been various predictions that jovian - mass extrasolar planets should also emit intense cyclotron maser emission at radio wavelengths @xcite .",
    "extrapolating empirical relationships based on the solar system planets , it is possible to make quantitative predictions for both the characteristic emission wavelength and radio luminosity for an extrasolar planet @xcite .    for the planet orbiting ,",
    "these predictions are that its characteristic emission wavelength should be between about  5 and  7 meters ( 45 and  60  mhz ) and that its radio luminosity would result in a flux density at the between roughly 1 and  250  mjy @xcite .",
    "the lower flux density estimates result from treating  as effectively a solar twin , while the higher estimates take into account its ( higher ) level of stellar activity resulting from it being younger than the sun @xcite .",
    "in addition , for the solar system planets , variations within the level of solar activity can amplify the cyclotron maser emission process , producing radio luminosities ( and therefore flux densities ) 12 orders of magnitude above the nominal level .",
    "indirect evidence for extrasolar planetary magnetic fields comes in the form of modulations in the h and  k lines of the stars and , modulations that are in phase with the orbital periods of their planets with the smallest semi - major axes @xcite .",
    "though they monitored , no similar modulations were seen .",
    "@xcite suggest that the line modulations result from energy transport related to the relative velocity between planet and the stellar magnetosphere .",
    "any such line modulations for  would then be suppressed because the star s rotation period is comparable to the planet s orbital period ( @xmath4  d , * ? ? ?",
    "suggestively , though , the polarization observations of @xcite do suggest a complex surface magnetic field topology for , consistent with a possible interaction with the planet s magnetic field .    for the solar system planets ,",
    "the cyclotron maser emission is fairly wideband with @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the very large array ( vla ) is equipped with a 4-meter wavelength ( 74  mhz ) receiving system .",
    "images can be made with the vla in its more extended configurations ( a and  b ) with rms noise levels of approximately 100  .",
    "thus , the radio emission from the planet may extend to wavelengths of  4  meters , and the planet may be detectable with current instrumentation .    this paper reports three epochs of  74  mhz observations of with the . in  [ sec : observe ] we describe the observations ; in  [ sec : analyze ] we analyze our observations both from the standpoint of the individual epochs as well as taken collectively and we make suggestions about the methodology for observations with future radio telescopes ; and in  [ sec : conclude ] we present our conclusions .",
    "our observations were conducted on three epochs with the vla in its more extended configurations .",
    "table  [ tab : log ] summarizes various observational details .",
    "the use of the extended vla configurations provided angular resolutions comparable to or better than 1 ; such resolution is required to reduce the impact of source confusion .",

    "the source served as both the bandpass , flux density , and visibility phase calibrator . for two of the epochs ( 1999 june  8 and 2003",
    "september  12 ) , visibility phase calibration was performed in much the same manner as at shorter wavelengths , with the phases determined from transferred to the  data .",
    "several iterations of hybrid mapping ( imaging and self - calibration ) then ensued .",
    "for the middle epoch , the data were acquired as part of the vla low - frequency sky survey ( vlss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for these data , small `` postage stamp '' images of bright sources from the nrao vla sky survey @xcite within the field of view were made every 1  min",
    "the positions of the nvss sources are determined at  20  cm , a wavelength at which the ionosphere should present only minor perturbations .",
    "the apparent positions at  4-meter wavelength were compared with the known positions from  20  cm .",
    "low - order zernicke polynomials were used to model the set of position offsets and thereby infer the phase corrections to be applied to the data . after applying these phase corrections ,",
    "the full data set was imaged .",
    "two significant differences for the post - processing were the impact of radio frequency interference ( rfi ) and the large fields of view . in order to combat rfi ,",
    "the data were acquired with a much higher spectral resolution than used for imaging .",
    "excision of potential rfi is performed on a per - baseline basis for each visibility spectrum . for two of the epochs ( 1999 june  8 and 2003",
    "september  12 ) , rfi was identified and excised manually ; for the second epoch ( 2001 january  19 ) , rfi was identified and excised on an automated basis by fitting a linear function to each 10-s visibility spectrum and removing outlier channels .",

    "the measurements reported here , we expect  to have moved by no more than about  5 . adding these uncertainties in quadrature , we expect that the position of  in these images should be uncertain by no more than about  8 .",
    "the size of the beam ( point spread function ) ranges from about  25  ( epochs  1 and  3 ) to  80  ( epoch  2 ) .",
    "we conclude that our astrometry is accurate to a fraction of a beam width .      in no epoch",
    "do we detect statistically significant emission at the location of .",
    "our first estimate for the upper limit to any emission from the planet orbiting  is obtained from the rms noise level in each image ( table  [ tab : log ] ) .",
    "because our astrometry is accurate to better than a beam width , we set an upper limit of  @xmath14 at each epoch .",
    "the resulting upper limits are 250300  mjy .",
    "as a second means for setting an upper limit , we use the brightest pixel within a beam centered on the position of  to estimate the flux density of any possible radio emission from its planet .",
    "this estimate takes into account the background level determined by the mean brightness in a region surrounding the central beam .",
    "upper limits determined in this manner range from  135 to  270  mjy .    as a final means for setting an upper limit",
    ", we have co - added ( `` stacked '' or superposed epoch analysis ) the three images , a technique has been used with great success to find weak sources in diverse data sets ( e.g. , sources contributing to the hard x - ray background , @xcite ; intergalactic stars in galaxy clusters , @xcite ) . experience with 74  mhz images shows that the rms noise level in an image produced from the sum of  @xmath15 images is @xmath16 lower , as expected if the noise in the images is gaussian random noise .",
    "obviously , by co - adding images , we will be less sensitive to a rare , large enhancement in the planetary radio emission caused by a temporary increase in the stellar wind flux , but we will be more sensitive to the nominal flux density , particularly for the higher estimates for the planet s flux density ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the ( @xmath17 ) noise level in the co - added image is 65  , a value consistent with that expected if the noise in all of the images is gaussian .",

    "the luminosity or radiated power and the emission bandwidth can be related to various planetary properties ( e.g. , mass and rotation rate of the planet ) .",
    "the standard practice has been to use empirical laws from the solar system to make predictions for @xmath20 and  @xmath21 .",
    "planetary radio emission has a characteristic wavelength  @xmath24 or frequency  @xmath25 , which is related to the cyclotron frequency at the lowest altitude at which emission is able to escape @xcite . in turn",
    ", this characteristic wavelength is related to the magnetic moment or the magnetic field strength at the planet s surface .",
    "the emission is typically broadband , with @xmath26 . in making predictions",
    ", it has been assumed that extrasolar planetary radio emission is comparably broadband , and , more importantly , that any observational searches would be carried out at a wavelength near @xmath24 ( frequency near  @xmath25 ) . from an observational standpoint",
    ", we shall incorporate a factor to take into account the possibility that a search may not have been conducted at an optimum wavelength .",
    "guided by the spectrum of emission , we use @xmath27 although the step function nature of @xmath28 may seem artificial , spectrum does cutoff sharply around  40  mhz , which is approximately @xmath29 .    combining equations  ( [ eqn : fluxdensity0 ] ) and  ( [ eqn : frequency ] ) , and making the assumption that @xmath30 , the expected flux density of an extrasolar planet when observed at a frequency  @xmath31 is @xmath32 we take @xmath20 , @xmath25 ( @xmath24 ) , and  @xmath22 to be planetary parameters with the objective of constraining them from observation .",
    "the distance  @xmath23 to the planet ( or its host star ) is typically known from other means .",
    "our methodology for searching for radio emission from an extrasolar planet has been to utilize a radio interferometer to make images of the field surrounding the planet . in the absence of a source ,",
    "the pixels in a thermal - noise limited image from a radio interferometer have a zero - mean normal distribution with a variance of  @xmath33 , so that the probability density function ( pdf ) of obtaining a pixel with a noise intensity between  @xmath15 and  @xmath34 is @xmath35    we adopt a signal model of @xmath36 for the intensity at the location of the planet , where  @xmath15 is the ( thermal ) noise in the image and  @xmath37 is the flux density contributed by the planet .",
    "we assume that @xmath37 is constant over the duration of the observation .",
    "if this is not the case , then the pdf of  @xmath37 would have to be incorporated into this analysis . in practice , perhaps the best that one could do would be to use what is known about the radio emission of the giant planets in the solar system to develop an appropriate pdf .",
    "for the purposes of this analysis , we shall treat @xmath37 as a constant , which has the effect that we will be placing constraints on the mean level of radio emission from a planet .",
    "a detection occurs if the pixel intensity exceeds some threshold , @xmath38 .",
    "thus , @xmath39 for simplicity , we define @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : fluxdensity ] ) suggests that small values of  @xmath22 would produce large flux densities .",
    "however , small values of  @xmath22 also imply that the radiation beam is unlikely to intersect our line of sight .",
    "we characterize the probability of intercept as @xmath42 for the solar system planets , the emission is beamed from both the northern and southern auroral regions .",
    "we presume that the line of sight to a planet can not intercept both regions simultaneously , so that the the appropriate denominator for this probability is a solid angle of  @xmath43  sr .",
    "clearly more complicated functions are possible , but we do not believe them warranted at this time . the full probability of detection is then @xmath44 where we have made explicit the planetary parameters that we seek to determine .",
    "suppose we have @xmath45 observations of a planet with @xmath46 detections , with @xmath47 describing the current observational state .",
    "can we place any constraints on the factors in equation  ( [ eqn : fluxdensity ] ) ?",
    "consider first a series of trials in which the probability of detecting the planet in any single trial  @xmath48 is the same .",
    "this case corresponds to one in which the observations are essentially identical .",
    "then the probability of detection in the several trials is given by the binomial probability @xmath49 the case of current interest would be that for which @xmath47 , @xmath50    in any actual observational case , @xmath48 will likely vary from epoch to epoch , most likely because the images will have different noise levels  @xmath51 .",
    "this is certainly the case if the images are obtained from different instruments ( e.g. , the vla vs.  the giant metrewave radio telescope ) .",
    "even images from the same instrument can have different noise levels , though , depending upon the prevalence of rfi during the observations , the number of antennas used , the duration of the observation , different elevations at which the source is observed , etc .",
    "( table  [ tab : log ] ) .",
    "we assume that the observations are independent , that is that the probability of detecting the planet in any given observation is independent of the other observations .",
    "this assumption is certainly warranted from the observational standpoint that the noise level  @xmath51 is independent from observational epoch to epoch",
    ". then the _ joint _ probability of detection is @xmath52 for which the total number of trials  @xmath53 and number of detections  @xmath54 are allowed to vary from one set of trials to another .",
    "we give the full expression here , anticipating that there may be future observations , potentially at a range of wavelengths ( e.g. , vla vs.  gmrt vs.  long wavelength array vs.  low frequency array , see below ) .",
    "for the case presented here , there is a single trial at each epoch with no detection , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , so @xmath58 for a set of observed threshold intensities  @xmath59 , the likelihood function is given by equation  ( [ eqn : total ] ) @xmath60 \\label{eqn : ltotal}\\ ] ] where we have made explicit the parameter dependences entering into @xmath37 .    for the observations reported here ,",
    "because we have observations at only one wavelength , we assume that the observing frequency is sufficiently close to @xmath25 that @xmath61 . in this case , the likelihood function ( equation  [ eqn : ltotal ] ) reduces to a function of only two parameters , @xmath20 and  @xmath22 . also , in practice , we compute the ( base  10 ) logarithm of the likelihood .",
    "figure  [ fig : likeli ] shows the ( log-)likelihood function , which we have computed with the image noise levels listed in table  [ tab : log ] and the brightest pixel limits ( table  [ tab : limits ] ) .",
    "the peak likelihood occurs in the lower central left of the plot , near @xmath62  w and @xmath63  sr .",
    "the location of this peak reflects our choice of limits on  @xmath20 , as lower power levels would also clearly be consistent with our non - detections .",
    "two comments on the likelihood function are warranted .",
    "first , the shape of the allowed region reflects two competing effects . from equation  ( [ eqn : fluxdensity ] ) ,",
    "the quantities @xmath20 and @xmath22 are degenerate .",
    "the planet could radiate intensely but be beamed into a narrow solid angle , with a low probability of detection , or it could have a wide beaming angle but with only modest luminosity .",
    "the competing effect is that , as the beaming angle becomes smaller , the probability of it intersecting our line of sight becomes progressively smaller .",
    "second , the upper limit on  @xmath20 in figure  [ fig : likeli ] is motivated by predictions . a crucial element of the prediction by @xcite is that the stellar mass loss rate was predicted on the basis of the star s x - ray flux .",
    "it now seems that stellar mass loss rates change character at a characteristic x - ray flux of about @xmath64  erg  cm@xmath12  s@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "below this value , stellar mass loss rates are highly correlated with x - ray flux ; above this value , the mass loss rates drop by an order of magnitude and remain relatively constant with increasing x - ray fluxes .",
    "the x - ray flux of  is essentially equal to the value at which stellar mass loss rates change character .",
    "thus , its mass loss rate could be overestimated by as much as an order of magnitude .",
    "@xcite predicts that the planet s cyclotron maser strength should scale with the mass loss rate as @xmath66 .",
    "thus , even if it is the case that the mass loss rate was overestimated by a factor of  10 , the radiated power from the planet could still be a factor of  5 above that which would be estimated assuming a solar mass loss rate .    for our observations",
    ", assuming that the planet does radiate at a wavelength of  4  m , we conclude that the upper end of the predicted power levels is allowed only if the beaming angle is @xmath67  sr . the cyclotron maser emission from the solar system planets",
    "is characterized by solid angles @xmath68  sr , typically emitted in a hollow cone , with a fairly wide opening angle ( @xmath69 ) and a finite thickness .",
    "recent analysis of cassini observations of during the spacecraft s cruise phase indicate that its decameter radiation illuminates a cone of half - width opening angle of  75  and a thickness of  15 , with an equivalent solid angle @xmath70  sr @xcite .",
    "in some cases , for example the earth s auroral kilometric radiation , the beaming angle can be @xmath71  sr @xcite .    for beaming angles comparable to those seen in the solar system ( @xmath72  sr )",
    ", the planet must radiate less than about  @xmath0  w or we would have a reasonable probability of detecting it .",
    "luminosities @xmath73  w are within the predicted range @xcite , though below the most recent estimates that attempt to incorporate what is known about the star s stellar wind strength . for comparison ,",
    "nominal radio luminosity is of order @xmath74  .",
    "@xcite also subdivided each observation of a single star into scans as short as 10  s ( the shortest nominal integration time provided by the vla ) .",
    "the motivation is that emission is quite variable , so , if the extrasolar planet radio emission is similar , subdividing the observation offers the possibility of detecting a `` burst , '' which might be quite short in duration and `` diluted '' if the entire ( @xmath75  hr ) observation is considered .",
    "though @xcite did not observe  at  4-m wavelength , we have considered the impact of subdividing the observation .",
    "the obvious benefit of subdividing is that the effective number of observations increases ; the disadvantage is that the noise level does as well .",
    "we assume similar observing parameters as obtained in our observing programs , namely a point - source noise level @xmath76  jy obtained in  1  hr for observations toward a star like .",
    "we find that sub - dividing the observation into  10 scans ( e.g. , each of  5  min.duration ) , which increases the noise level to @xmath77  jy , leads to essentially no improvement in the constraints that can be set .    as a final comment on our likelihood method",
    ", we anticipate future observations , either with existing or future instruments ( see below ) might be at different wavelengths . a significant assumption in our likelihood analysis",
    "is that searches are conducted at a common wavelength and that the planet emits at that wavelength . in the case of , for instance ,",
    "its electron cyclotron emission cuts off sharply shortward of approximately 7.5  meters ( @xmath78  mhz ) . presuming that similar processes operate in the magnetospheres of extrasolar giant planets , observations at different wavelengths may not be equally constraining .",
    "similarly , one might wish to take into account what is known about the beaming angles from the solar system planets .",
    "it would be relatively straightforward to incorporate this prior information and extend our likelihood analysis to a bayesian formulation . in that case",
    ", appropriate priors would have to be specified for the emission wavelength , beaming angle , and radiated power .",
    "there are a number of next - generation , long wavelength radio instruments under development .",
    "notable among these are the low frequency array ( lofar ) and the long wavelength array ( lwa ) . if deployed as intended , both promise to provide sensitivities at least an order of magnitude larger than the 4-meter wavelength vla at comparable wavelengths ( @xmath79  m or @xmath80  mhz ) . here",
    "we consider whether additional observations with current instrumentation is preferable to the operation of these future facilities .",
    "we simulated two sets of flux density measurements toward a star like .",
    "for both measurements the typical flux density measurement was taken to be a gaussian random variable with a specified mean and variance and the rms noise level was taken to be a factor of  2.5 times smaller .",
    "the first set of measurements had noise levels and flux density limits similar to those measured here , but we considered the impact of having 15 measurements rather than just 3 . not detecting planetary radio emission in such a data set would not improve significantly on the radiated power constraints ( at most by a factor of a few ) but would place increasingly severe constraints on the beaming angle at large power levels .",
    "we have also considered the requirements on an instrument in order to improve the constraints significantly .",
    "figure  [ fig : future ] illustrates the constraints placed by  5 measurements with an instrument capable of obtaining flux density measurements of approximately 25  mjy with rms noise levels of approximately 7  .",
    "obtaining significant ( an order of magnitude or better ) improvements on the powers radiated by extrasolar planetary electron cyclotron masers will require measurements at this level . one significant advantage that future long - wavelength instruments are likely to have over current instruments , though , is that future instruments are likely to have a multi - beaming capability .",
    "consequently , there is likely to be significantly more time for observation and a much larger number of measurements ( or even detections ! ) will be obtained .",
    "we report three ( 3 ) epochs of 4-meter wavelength ( 74  mhz ) observations of  with the .",
    "our objective was to detect the electron cyclotron maser emission from the planet orbiting this star , assuming that the planet does produce the equivalent of jovian radio emissions .",
    "in none of our 3 epochs did we detect emission at the location of . for a single epoch ( table  [ tab : limits ] ) , our limits on its emission range from  150 to  300  mjy , equivalent to a range of luminosities of approximately 1@xmath81  .",
    "we have also stacked ( `` co - added '' ) the images to produce an average limit of  165  mjy , equivalent to a luminosity of @xmath82  .    we have developed a likelihood method to consider multi - epoch measurements .",
    "our likelihood function depends upon three planetary parameters , the planet s radiated power level  @xmath20 , the beaming solid angle of the electron cyclotron maser  @xmath22 , and the characteristic wavelength of emission  @xmath24 . under the assumption that the planet does radiate at our observed wavelength , the parameters @xmath20 and  @xmath22 are degenerate ( figure  [ fig : likeli ] ) .",
    "we find that the typical radiated power must be less than about  @xmath0   unless the beaming solid angle is @xmath1  sr , which would be considerably smaller than the typical value for solar system planets .",
    "power levels @xmath73  w are within the predicted range @xcite , being comparable to or below the most recent estimates that attempt to incorporate what is known about the star s stellar wind strength .    we have also considered future long - wavelength instruments , such as the lwa and .",

    "<S> all of the solar system gas giants produce electron cyclotron masers , driven by the solar wind impinging on their magnetospheres . extrapolating to the planet orbiting </S>",
    "<S> , various authors have predicted that it may be within the detection limits of the 4-meter wavelength ( 74  mhz ) system on the very large array </S>",
    "<S> . this paper reports three epochs of observations of . in no epoch </S>",
    "<S> do we detect the planet ; various means of determining the upper limit to the emission yield single - epoch limits ranging from  135 to  300  mjy . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a likelihood method for multi - epoch observations and use it to constrain various radiation properties of the planet . assuming that the planet does radiate at our observation wavelength </S>",
    "<S> , its typical luminosity must be less than about  @xmath0  , unless its radiation is highly beamed into a solid angle @xmath1  sr . while within the range of luminosities predicted by various authors for this planet , this value is lower than recent estimates which attempt to take into account the stellar wind of  using the known properties of the star itself . </S>",
    "<S> electron cyclotron maser emission from solar systems planets is beamed , but with characteristic solid angles of approximately 1  sr illuminated . </S>",
    "<S> future long - wavelength instruments ( e.g. , the long wavelength array and the low frequency array ) must be able to make typical flux density measurements on short time scales ( @xmath2  min . ) of approximately 25  mjy in order to improve these constraints significantly . </S>"
