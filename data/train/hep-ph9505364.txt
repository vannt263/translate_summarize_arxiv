    "in this paper we study the dynamical generation of momentum dependent fermion four - point functions within the framework of non - abelian gauge theories",
    ". these will be purely non - perturbative quantities associated with breakdown of chiral symmetries , and would for example imply the existence of the corresponding four - fermion condensates .",
    "our analysis is based on the schwinger - dyson ( sd ) formalism .",
    "the resulting equations are analytically intractable and thus we seek numerical solutions .",
    "we have two main goals in this study .",
    "one is to estimate the critical value of the gauge coupling necessary for the formation of the four - point functions .",
    "we would like to study this in a case where four - point functions develop on scales higher than the scale of mass formation .",
    "this would make it consistent to treat the four - point function problem in isolation , independently of the mass generation problem .",
    "this is not the case for qcd , but even in that case it is useful to at least consider the existence of the effects we study here .    in extensions of the standard model",
    "the hierarchical symmetry breaking pattern we envisage can be a natural consequence of the fact that a dynamical four - point function may break fewer continuous symmetries than a dynamical mass . in the case that some of these symmetries are gauged , then these additional interactions could resist the formation of mass .",
    "if so , dynamical masses may form on a scale lower than the scale of the four - point functions , or not form at all . with these possibilities in mind , we shall simply ignore fermion mass in the present work .",
    "a multiflavor case will be discussed elsewhere @xcite in which it is possible to add abelian gauge interactions such as to make the theory chiral , so that any mass will break some gauge symmetry . in that theory",
    "some four - point functions do not break any gauge symmetry ; this provides a dynamical reason for why four - point functions form and masses do not .",
    "there are also four - point functions for which the effects of the extra @xmath4 s essentially cancel out , leaving only the attractive non - abelian interactions .",
    "the study of such four - point functions would be very similar to the study of four - point functions in our simplified single - flavor case , where we assume the mass vanishes .",
    "our other goal is to extract the momentum dependence of the dynamical fermion four - point function .",
    "for example if such an object is to play a role in generating a fermion or a gauge - boson mass , then two or four lines of the four - point function may be closed off into a loop or into another four - point function .",
    "it proves then interesting to study the details of the momentum dependence , such as the relative size of the four - point function when different pairs of momenta are large .",
    "the factorization hypothesis , according to which the four - point function can be treated as a product of two two - point functions , is of no use here since we neglect two - fermion condensates .    in the present study we use a one gauge - boson exchange approximation . since the gauge boson can attach to any pair of the four legs , the sd equation sums up a much more complicated set of diagrams than the set of ladder graphs .",
    "the present work constitutes a clear progress with respect to our previous study @xcite , since , apart from considering a general non - abelian group , it includes a treatment of non - linearities , it does not neglect terms proportional to external momenta while at the same time exploring the full available momentum space , and in a certain limit allows us to comment on the behavior of certain @xmath2-point functions .    in the next section we consider the sd equation for the fermion chirality - flipping four - point function in a non - abelian theory , and then compute the form it takes in the large-@xmath1 limit of an @xmath0 theory in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we discuss our numerical treatment and results , and in section 5 we generalize our results to @xmath2-point functions .",
    "we focus our attention on fermion operators which are purely chirality changing of the form @xmath5 + h.c . , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we constrain our study to just one fermion flavor in a representation of a gauged simple lie group .",
    "the four independent operators which have this property and respect parity are @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the generators of the non - abelian lie algebra .",
    "the four - point functions corresponding to these four operators receive exclusively non - perturbative contributions . from now on we will denote all operators of the form @xmath10 , where @xmath11 are matrices with possibly non - trivial spinor and color structure , by @xmath12 .",
    "the chiral @xmath13 is anomalous , but its discrete subgroup @xmath14 where @xmath3 is an integer is still present and would have to be broken before fermion mass could form . as mentioned in the introduction , other effects in a more realistic theory could resist the breaking of such a symmetry . here",
    "we shall simply assume that fermion masses are smaller than the typical scale of our problem , and can thus be ignored .",
    "note that we have omitted chirality flipping operators with derivatives , having structures like @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where each of the derivatives with indices @xmath17 acts on one of the four fermion fields .",
    "we will present arguments supporting their omission later .",
    "the sd formalism relevant to these four - point functions was discussed in ref . @xcite and led to an equation shown diagrammatically in fig .",
    "[ fig : sd4 ] .",
    "it results from a simple truncation of the sd hierarchy achieved by approximating the five - point function involving four fermions and a gluon by the sum of tree graphs involving the four - point function .",
    "( the equation has been symmetrized to include diagrams with gluons connecting all possible pairs of fermions , so the right - hand side is multiplied by a factor of @xmath18 . )",
    "the analogous procedure used in the sd equation for the two - point function yields the popular ladder approximation . in our case",
    "the set of diagrams being resummed has a more complicated structure than sets of ladder graphs . in both cases gauge self - interactions",
    "no longer appear in the sd equation .",
    "in the two - point case it is then true that there is little difference between abelian and non - abelian interactions . on the contrary in the four - point case",
    "we show that there is still a big difference ; for non - abelian interactions the space of four point functions is enlarged and the mixing between the four - point functions is completely different .",
    "we are considering a four - point function associated with the green function @xmath19 . in momentum space ,",
    "the four - point function involving scalar functions of momentum only and receiving exclusively non - perturbative contributions is @xmath20 where the four scalar functions @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 depend on 6 variables , which are all the independent and lorentz - invariant combinations of the external 4-momenta @xmath25 , corresponding to the fermions with spinor indices @xmath26 respectively .",
    "we wish to develop the sd equations for these scalar functions .    similarly to our previous work @xcite , we begin by defining the following functional operators @xmath27 : @xmath28 & \\equiv & \\frac{\\alpha}{8\\pi^{3}}\\int d^{4}k \\frac{k}{(p_{1}-k)^{2}(p_{2}+k)^{2 } } \\nonumber \\\\   \\gamma^{b}[k ] & \\equiv & \\frac{\\alpha}{8\\pi^{3}}\\int d^{4}k \\frac{k}{(p_{3}+k)^{2}(p_{4}-k)^{2 } } \\nonumber \\\\   \\gamma^{c}[k ] & \\equiv & \\frac{\\alpha}{8\\pi^{3}}\\int d^{4}k \\frac{k}{(p_{1}-k)^{2}(p_{4}-k)^{2 } } \\nonumber \\\\   \\gamma^{d}[k ] & \\equiv & \\frac{\\alpha}{8\\pi^{3}}\\int d^{4}k \\frac{k}{(p_{2}+k)^{2}(p_{3}+k)^{2 } } \\nonumber \\\\   \\gamma^{e}[k ] & \\equiv & \\frac{\\alpha}{8\\pi^{3}}\\int d^{4}k \\frac{k}{(p_{1}-k)^{2}(p_{3}-k)^{2 } } \\nonumber \\\\   \\gamma^{f}[k ] & \\equiv & \\frac{\\alpha}{8\\pi^{3}}\\int d^{4}k \\frac{k}{(p_{2}+k)^{2}(p_{4}+k)^{2}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is a function of the loop and external momenta , with a possibly non - trivial spinor structure , the letters @xmath30 correspond to the diagrams shown in fig.[fig : sd4 ] with the gauge boson having four - momentum @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the momentum - independent coupling .",
    "we work in the landau gauge which is popular in studies of sd equations ; the gauge boson propagator reads @xmath33 .",
    "the choice of this gauge will be further justified later , when we consider the large-@xmath1 limit of an @xmath0 gauge theory .    by combining the results of the abelian case @xcite with the study on the color structure given in appendix a , and considering fermions in the fundamental representation of @xmath0 , we have @xmath34 + 6(\\overline{\\gamma^{c}}+\\overline{\\gamma^{d}}- \\overline{\\gamma^{e } } -\\overline{\\gamma^{f}})[{\\cal o}_{t}^{color } ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\nonumber \\\\ { \\cal o}_{t } & = & -\\frac{n^{2}-1}{2n}(\\overline{\\gamma^{a}}+ \\overline{\\gamma^{b}})[{\\cal o}_{t } ] + 2 ( \\overline{\\gamma^{c } } + \\overline{\\gamma^{d } } + \\overline{\\gamma^{e } } + \\overline{\\gamma^{f}})[{\\cal o}_{t}^{color } ] + \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\frac{1}{2 } ( \\overline{\\gamma^{c } } + \\overline{\\gamma^{d } } -\\overline{\\gamma^{e } } -\\overline{\\gamma^{f}})[{\\cal o}_{s+p}^{color } ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\nonumber \\\\ { \\cal o}_{s+p}^{color } & = & -\\frac{3}{2n}(\\overline{\\gamma^{a}}+ \\overline{\\gamma^{b}})[{\\cal o}_{s+p}^{color } ] + \\frac{3(n^{2}-1)}{2n^{2 } } ( \\overline{\\gamma^{c } } + \\overline{\\gamma^{d } } -\\overline{\\gamma^{e } } -\\overline{\\gamma^{f}})[{\\cal o}_{t } ] + \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\nonumber \\\\ & & 6\\left(-\\frac{n^{2}+2}{2n}(\\overline{\\gamma^{c}}+\\overline{\\gamma^{d } } ) + \\frac{1}{n}(\\overline{\\gamma^{e}}+\\overline{\\gamma^{f}})\\right ) [ { \\cal o}_{t}^{color } ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\nonumber \\\\ { \\cal o}_{t}^{color } & = &   \\left(\\frac{1}{2n}(\\overline{\\gamma^{a}}+ \\overline{\\gamma^{b}})+ \\left(-\\frac{n^{2}+2}{n}(\\overline{\\gamma^{c}}+\\overline{\\gamma^{d } } ) - \\frac{2}{n}(\\overline{\\gamma^{e}}+\\overline{\\gamma^{f}})\\right)\\right ) [ { \\cal o}_{t}^{color } ] + \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\frac{n^{2}-1}{2n^{2 } } ( \\overline{\\gamma^{c } } + \\overline{\\gamma^{d } } + \\overline{\\gamma^{e } } + \\overline{\\gamma^{f}})[{\\cal o}_{t } ] + \\frac{n^{2}-1}{8n^{2 } } ( \\overline{\\gamma^{c } } + \\overline{\\gamma^{d } } -\\overline{\\gamma^{e } } -\\overline{\\gamma^{f}})[{\\cal o}_{s+p } ] + \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\frac{1}{2 } \\left(-\\frac{n^{2}+2}{2n}(\\overline{\\gamma^{c}}+\\overline{\\gamma^{d}})+ \\frac{1}{n}(\\overline{\\gamma^{e}}+\\overline{\\gamma^{f}})\\right ) [ { \\cal o}_{s+p}^{color } ] , \\label{eq : central}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath35 \\equiv \\gamma^{i}({\\cal o}^{i})$ ] and @xmath36 are the form factors with loop - dependent arguments corresponding to diagrams @xmath37 @xcite .    we are faced with a system of four coupled 4-dimensional integral equations involving functions of 6 variables .",
    "as it stands , the problem is analytically intractable , and even a numerical solution proves to be beyond our present means . in the next section we present the simplification that the large-@xmath1 limit of @xmath0 provides .",
    "by taking the large-@xmath1 limit , ( [ eq : central ] ) reduces to limit only within the context of the truncated sd equation , and we do not claim that the large-@xmath1 limit in any way justifies the original truncation of the sd hierarchy . ]",
    "@xmath38 \\\\~\\\\ \\left [ { \\cal o}_{t}\\right ]",

    "the @xmath21 entry is positive , which means that there is an attractive interaction in this channel necessary for the formation of a non - zero four - point function .",
    "in contrast @xmath39 is not expected to be non - zero .",
    "it is also apparent that @xmath40 can be non - zero only if @xmath41 is somehow non - zero , but that seems unlikely because of the negative entry coming from @xmath41 itself .",
    "even if the @xmath42 functions were somehow non - zero , we would expect for them a critical coupling larger than the one required for @xmath21 .",
    "the large-@xmath1 limit also allows us to argue for the omission of contributions coming from operators proportional to external momenta . with regards to the operators with structure @xmath43 and @xmath44",
    ", we can see that the contributions they receive from the dominant diagrams having the same functions in their vertices ( diagrams @xmath45 and @xmath46 for @xmath47 color structures , diagrams @xmath48 and @xmath49 for @xmath50 color structures ) are negative , so we do not expect the corresponding four - point functions to be non - zero .",
    "this happens because , in the large-@xmath1 limit , tensor insertions give negative contributions .",
    "even if other terms made them non - zero , they would require a larger gauge coupling than the one needed for @xmath51 .",
    "interesting also are the operators with structure @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( and trivial color structure ) , which can obviously mix with the form factor @xmath21 .",
    "if we take the operator @xmath54 for instance , we see that it receives a negative contribution from diagram @xmath45 and a positive one from diagram @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , it might not develop a non - zero value , and if it did , it would require a larger value for the gauge coupling than the critical value we are seeking",
    ". these operators will also be neglected .",
    "we now write down the integral equation for @xmath21 .",
    "we go to a reference frame where @xmath55 , where the form of the kernel of the integral equation indicates that @xmath21 is a function of five variables , i.e. @xmath56 where the two terms on the right - hand side come from diagrams @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and the two fermions in the loop have four - momenta @xmath31 and @xmath59 respectively .",
    "we find that a solution to the above integral equation takes the factorized form @xmath60 .",
    "this just reflects the fact that the loop integral in diagram @xmath45 does not depend on @xmath61 and @xmath62 for a given @xmath63 , and similarly for diagram @xmath46 . by momentarily setting @xmath64 and @xmath65",
    "we obtain an equation for @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath67 we have separated @xmath63 from the other two variables with a semi - colon since it is an argument of @xmath66 that is not affected by loop momenta , and it can thus be treated as if it were a parameter in the kernel .    note that for @xmath68 this reduces to the linearized sd equation for the fermion two - point function . for non - zero @xmath63 , the problem reduces to the one of a three - point function , which has been studied before @xcite . after some dirac algebra , and omitting terms with structure @xmath69 according to our previous discussion",
    ", the equation becomes @xmath70 in the following we will change our variables from @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 , to @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 . without loss of generality we will write @xmath79 with @xmath80 and @xmath81 .    at this stage our equation is linear , and the function @xmath82 remains undetermined . clearly",
    "some essential physics , containing the non - linearities , has been omitted by the original truncation . in the two - point function case",
    "it is known that the main effect of the non - linearities can be modeled by introducing an infrared cutoff , which is determined in a self - consistent manner by identifying it with the dynamical mass evaluated at the infrared cutoff .",
    "we will follow a similar procedure in the four - point function case by identifying the infrared cutoff with @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the infrared cutoff when @xmath85 , and then determining @xmath82 in a self - consistent manner .",
    "non - linear effects will enter through diagrams involving an odd number of four - point functions , an example of which is provided by the diagram in fig.[fig : sd3 ] .",
    "for large gluon momentum this diagram is much more suppressed than the diagrams we have been considering ; the diagram only becomes important for small gluon momentum .",
    "this diagram thus provides an example of how non - linear effects could introduce a natural infrared cutoff into our problem .",
    "unfortunately , it is not easy to resum such diagrams , as is possible in the two - point function case .    our result for the 4-point function will take the form @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a dimensionless constant .",
    "it is interesting that @xmath87 may have to be significantly larger than unity , in order to compensate for the loop - phase - space suppression factors appearing in diagrams such as fig.[fig : sd3 ] .    in place of an explicit infrared cutoff",
    "we choose to multiply the kernel of our equation by the function @xmath88 .",
    "the final equation becomes @xmath89 where @xmath90 .",
    "we solve for the function @xmath91 in order to increase the accuracy of the numerical solution that follows , since we expect @xmath46 to decrease with increasing @xmath92 .",
    "we note that our crude representation of the infrared effects does not affect the functional form of @xmath46 when @xmath92 is large .",
    "with regards to the gauge dependence of our results we note that the use of the landau gauge , along with a bare massless fermion propagator and a bare gluon - fermion vertex , is consistent with the ward - takahashi identity at one - loop .",
    "moreover , in the large-@xmath1 limit only diagrams @xmath45 and @xmath46 are important and the situation is then expected to be similar to that of the two - point function .",
    "in particular in that case the use of the landau gauge in the ladder approximation yields results resembling those found in gauge - invariant treatments @xcite .",
    "the form of the integral equation allows us to use the same discretization lattice for the arguments of the function @xmath46 inside and outside the integral .",
    "the angles are discretized according to @xmath93 .",
    "we avoid the endpoints where the angles are equal to @xmath94 or @xmath95 since our integral has an integrable singularity there .",
    "the momenta are discretized according to @xmath96 , where @xmath97 are the infrared and ultraviolet cut - offs .",
    "@xmath98 does not have to be much larger than the energy scale where our function is negligibly small . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath99 has to be smaller than @xmath84 which provides an effective infrared cutoff to our theory .",
    "we choose to work with the ratios @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "we choose the number of points ( @xmath3 ) in each dimension to be equal to 40 .",
    "our results change little when this number is increased .",
    "the integral equation is solved via a relaxation method .",
    "we first insert an initial configuration for our function , and then iterate the equation until it is satisfied to a reasonable accuracy .",
    "we start by setting @xmath68 and determine the critical coupling necessary for a solution .",
    "we then keep this coupling fixed , and for different values of @xmath63 we compute @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "our critical coupling is @xmath104 which , from our previous discussion , is the same as the one for chiral symmetry breaking via the two - point function with the same cut - offs . in the large-@xmath1 limit and for infinite @xmath98",
    "this coupling is given by @xmath105 .",
    "the function @xmath102 has only a weak dependence on @xmath106 , and in fig .",
    "[ fig:52 ] we plot @xmath107 .",
    "we see that @xmath107 exhibits the @xmath108 behavior ( with @xmath109 a coupling - dependent constant ) that is well known in two - point function studies .",
    "@xmath110 is independent of @xmath111 as expected , and even for non - zero @xmath63 the dependence on @xmath111 remains very weak .",
    "the main @xmath106 dependence enters in the function @xmath103 which we plot in fig.[fig:54 ] .",
    "@xmath103 falls rapidly with increasing @xmath63 ; we find that @xmath63 can not exceed @xmath84 by much ( @xmath112 ) before the whole solution collapses to zero .",
    "the form that the integral equation takes for large @xmath1 suggests a possible generalization of the above results . in particular , the diagrams that dominate are the ones in which a gluon is attached between two fermion fields with spinor indices contracted with each other",
    ". therefore , one might expect only condensates of the form @xmath113 , where the ellipsis stands for @xmath114 fermion fields paired with each other .",
    "they should form at a critical value of the gauge coupling similar to that required by the two- and four - point functions .",
    "moreover , we expect the corresponding scalar @xmath2-point function @xmath115 to factorize as @xmath116 .",
    "each @xmath117 depends on the momenta of the respective fermion pair . in order for each of the @xmath118 to satisfy the same final integral equation as before , however",
    ", we would have to assume that the three - momenta of the fermions in each pair are equal and opposite , so that @xmath119 .",
    "we expect , though , that our previous functions @xmath46 and @xmath120 should describe the qualitative momentum behavior of the @xmath2-point functions if we are able to go to an optimal reference frame where the various @xmath121 are reasonably small .",
    "in this work we considered chirality - changing fermion four - point functions in a non - abelian gauge theory which receive non - perturbative contributions exclusively . we have tackled the problem by writing down an equation derived from a truncation of the infinite sd hierarchy . the solution to this equation",
    "is expected to illustrate some generic properties of four - point functions .",
    "the large-@xmath1 limit of @xmath0 renders the four - point problem similar to that of the three - point function .",
    "we find that a particular four - point function is much more likely to form than other four - point functions , and that its critical coupling is similar to the one required for a two - fermion condensate .",
