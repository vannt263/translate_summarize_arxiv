    "a number of researchers have examined the emission during naked singularity formation . in classical theory ,",
    "shapiro and teukolsky  @xcite reported the drastic growth of a curvature polynomial but no apparent horizon in their numerical simulation of the axisymmetric collapse of a prolate spheroid of collisionless particles .",
    "they also reported that little gravitational radiation was emitted in their simulation . on the other hand , nakamura , shibata and",
    "nakao  @xcite suggested that the naked singularity formation in the collapse of a prolate spheroid may provide a strong source of gravitational waves .",
    "recently , iguchi , nakao , and harada  @xcite and iguchi , harada , and nakao  @xcite examined the behavior of nonspherical linear perturbations of the collapse of an inhomogeneous dust ball .",
    "one of their main results is that perturbations of a curvature polynomial grow unboundedly while the energy flux of the gravitational waves remains finite as the cauchy horizon is approached , which implies that the instability is rather milder .",
    "on the other hand , hawking  @xcite showed that thermal radiation is emitted in the gravitational collapse to a black hole .",
    "the emission can be interpreted as particle creation due to the time variation of a strong spacetime curvature . in the collapse to a black hole ,",
    "the magnitude of the spacetime curvature of the observable region is , at most , the order of the inverse square of its gravitational mass because the singularity is covered by the event horizon . on the other hand , in the collapse to naked singularity",
    ", the magnitude of the spacetime curvature outside the event horizon grows unboundedly and the strongly curved region can be seen by an observer .",
    "this fact suggests that naked singularity formation may be a strong source of emission due to the quantum effect . in this context , ford and parker",
    "@xcite calculated the radiation during the formation process of shell - crossing naked singularity .",
    "they found that both the power and the energy remain finite , which is because of the weakness of the shell - crossing singularity .",
    "they also showed that the collapse of supercritically charged matter to the naked singularity emitts unbounded power and energy , although this spacetime is not a solution of the einstein equation .",

    "the last two examples in which the diverging power is emitted are self - similar collapse . however , the self - similar collapse is a particular solution among gravitational collapse solutions in general relativity .",
    "moreover , we do not know whether or not the central part of the realistic collapse of the nonzero pressure perfect fluid tends to be self similar in a strong - gravity regime such as a shell - focusing singularity , although such tendency has been observed in the newtonian regime . for the self - similar collapse of a dust ball",

    "moreover , it is known that such a solution does not allow the initial density profile which is a @xmath8 function with respect to the local cartesian coordinates . on the other hand ,",
    "christodoulou  @xcite imposed the @xmath8 condition on the initial density distribution in his famous paper on the violation of cosmic censorship in the collapse of a dust ball . for the @xmath8 case , the redshift is finite and the naked singularity is not very strong .",

    "though the einstein equation does not require such strong differentiability to initial data , we usually set such initial data in most astrophysical numerical simulations .",

    "<S> it is well known that a naked singularity occurs in the gravitational collapse of an inhomogeneous dust ball from an initial density profile which is physically reasonable . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we show that explosive radiation is emitted during the formation process of the naked singularity while we fix the background spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> the energy flux is proportional to @xmath0 for a minimally coupled massless scalar field , while it is proportional to @xmath1 for a conformally coupled massless scalar field , where @xmath2 is the `` remaineing time '' until the distant observer could observe the singularity if the naked singularity was formed . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> , the radiated energy grows unboundedly for both scalar fields . </S>",
    "<S> the amount of the power and energy depends on the parameters which characterize the initial density profile but do not depend on the gravitational mass of the cloud . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , there is a characteristic frequency @xmath3 of the singularity above which the divergent energy is radiated . </S>",
    "<S> the energy flux is dominated by particles of which the wavelength is about @xmath2 at each moment . </S>",
    "<S> the observed total spectrum is nonthermal , i.e. , @xmath4 for @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> if the naked singularity formation could continue until a considerable fraction of the total energy of the dust cloud is radiated , the radiated energy would reach about @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations are based on the geometrical optics approximation which turns out to be consistent for a rough order estimate . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis does not depend on whether or not the naked singularity occurs in its exact meaning . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon may provide a new candidate for a source of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays or a central engine of @xmath7-ray bursts .    </S>",
