    "production of the light element boron in standard big bang nucleosynthesis models is negligible ( see , e.g. , pagel 1997 ) . the chemical evolution of boron is determined by its production through cosmic ray spallation of interstellar material ( reeves , fowler , & hoyle 1970 ; meneguzzi , audouze , & reeves 1971 ) and/or neutrino - induced spallation in type ii supernovae ( woosley et al . 1990 ) and its destruction via astration .",
    "the evolution of the cosmic boron abundance therefore reflects the cosmic ray flux and/or supernova rate history in the milky way .",

    "the boron abundance of the present - day ism may be more appropriate for such studies .",
    "the differences between the solar system and the ism could yield important information on the recent chemical evolution of the solar neighborhood .",
    "here we present new high - resolution observations of interstellar b@xmath12ii@xmath13 and o@xmath12i  @xmath14 absorption towards the stars hd  104705 , hd  121968 , hd  177989 , hd  218915 , and hd  303308 taken with stis  on - board the _ hubble space telescope ( hst)_. we also present analyses of the b / o abundances along the @xmath15 scorpii b and @xmath16 ophiuchi sightlines using archival ghrs datasets .",
    "we have more than doubled the measurements of interstellar boron , and the available data now probe a wide range of diffuse ism environments . after discussing our observations in  [ sec : observations ] , we will show in  [ sec : results ] that the present - day interstellar b / h ratio seems to be dominated by the incorporation of boron into dust grains .",
    "thus the interstellar gas - phase boron abundance provides only a lower limit to the total ( gas+dust ) interstellar boron abundance .",
    "the stis  data used here were obtained as part of our stis  go program ( # 7270 ) , with the exception of the hd  303308 data , which were obtained from the stis  archive . in all cases the observations employed the far - ultraviolet mama detector and the e140h grating with the light from the star passing through the @xmath17 aperture .",
    "the resolution of these data is @xmath18 km  s@xmath19  ( fwhm ) .",
    "the data were extracted and the backgrounds estimated as described by howk & sembach ( 2000 ) . for spectral regions covered in multiple orders ( or observations ) , we have coadded the flux - calibrated data and weighted the contribution of each individual spectrum by the inverse - square of its error vector .",
    "the archival , post - costar ghrs data used in this work were reduced as discussed by howk , savage , & fabian ( 1999 ) .",
    "the @xmath15  sco bdata were obtained through the large science aperture , while the @xmath16  oph  data were obtained through the small science aperture .",
    "both datasets employed the ech - a grating , yielding a resolution of @xmath20 km  s@xmath19  ( fwhm ) .",
    "figure [ fig : spectra ] shows the stis  spectra and table [ tab : eqwidths ] gives the measured equivalent widths , @xmath21 , for the new stis  and ghrs measurements .",
    "the continua were estimated using low - order legendre polynomial fits to regions free of interstellar lines , and our @xmath22 error estimates include continuum placement uncertainties and the effects of 2%zero - point uncertainties for both spectrographs ( sembach & savage 1992 ) .",
    "federman et al . ( 1993 ) and lambert et al . (",

    "we derive an equivalent width using the ech - a of @xmath25 m , within @xmath22 of the lambert et al .",
    "we do not find clear evidence for b@xmath12ii  absorption in the small science aperture g160 m grating data to a @xmath26 limiting equivalent width of @xmath27 m , consistent with our ech - a results .",
    "however , the continuum placement uncertainties are large in this region of the spectrum when using the intermediate - resolution g160 m grating .",
    "alternative continuum placements could push this limiting equivalent width as high as 2.1 m .",
    "we believe that the ech - a results are the most reliable for this sightline and adopt @xmath25 m  for the b@xmath12ii  absorption towards @xmath16  oph .",
    "the sightline towards @xmath15  sco b  also deserves comment .",
    "the sightline to this star passes through the stellar wind of the m1.5 ib primary ( antares ) , which lies @xmath28 from the @xmath15  sco b  sightline ( van der hucht , bernat , & kondo 1980 ; bernat 1982 ; cardelli 1984 ) .",
    "it is therefore possible that the absorption lines in the spectra of @xmath15  sco b  probe the wind of the primary star .",
    "we do not believe that the o@xmath12i  and b@xmath12ii  absorption seen in the archival ghrs spectra are caused by the stellar wind .",
    "these species show two blends of material centered at @xmath29 and + 3.5 km  s@xmath19 .",
    "material associated with the wind is centered near @xmath30 km  s@xmath19(van der hucht et al .",
    "the archival ghrs dataset contains good observations of lines that trace only the outflowing stellar wind , notably , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath32 .",
    "these lines are clearly shifted with respect to the o@xmath12i  and b@xmath12ii  absorption .",
    "they are centered near @xmath30 km  s@xmath19 , often with wings extending towards more negative velocities .",
    "there is no evidence for wind material at the velocities of the o@xmath12i  and b@xmath12ii  absorption .",
    "therefore , we believe the absorption line measurements presented in table [ tab : eqwidths ] trace the ism in this direction rather than the stellar wind of antares.i  derived below is comparable to that of other stars in this region of sky with similar distances ( meyer et al . 1998 ) . ]",

    "we also compile all measurements of interstellar b@xmath12ii  using _ hst _ data from the literature ( with references given in the table ) .",
    "the new o@xmath12i  and b@xmath12ii  column densities were derived by integrating the apparent optical depth profiles ( savage & sembach 1991 ) of each line . in a few cases",
    "we have deemed it necessary to apply moderate saturation corrections to the o@xmath12i  column densities .",
    "we have tested for saturation problems and derived the necessary corrections by applying a single - component curve of growth to the measured o@xmath12i  equivalent widths ( table [ tab : eqwidths ] ) , adopting @xmath34-values derived from a curve - of - growth fit to several c@xmath12i  lines for each sightline .",
    "the o@xmath12i  absorption is dominated by narrow components that are also strong in species that trace dense clouds such as c@xmath12i , , , and co. while c@xmath12i  and o@xmath12i  need not be coexistent , the emperical association of c@xmath12i  and o@xmath12i  absorption , particularly in the components where the saturation is likely to be greatest , gives us confidence that c@xmath12i  saturation effects provide a suitable means for understanding the o@xmath12i  saturation along these sightlines .",
    "the o@xmath12i  apparent column densities we obtained for four of the sightlines from table [ tab : eqwidths ] required moderate saturation corrections of + 0.06 to + 0.08 dex based on the curve - of - growth fits , and these have been noted in table [ tab : abundances ] .",

    "( 1998 ) . ]",
    "figure [ fig : b2o ] shows a clear trend of decreasing [ b / o ] abundance with increasing @xmath35 .",
    "such a trend is often observed for species incorporated into interstellar dust grains ( cf . , jenkins 1987 ) .",
    "the general decrease in gas - phase abundance with increasing @xmath35reflects the mixture of cold and warm diffuse clouds along the line of sight ( jenkins , savage , & spitzer 1986 ) , where the cold clouds exhibit a greater incorporation of elements into interstellar grains .",
    "all of the stis targets in table [ tab : abundances ] have distances @xmath43 pc , while the ghrs targets are all at @xmath44 pc .",
    "it is conceivable that the gas being probed by the stis data is also significantly more distant than that being probed by the ghrs data . in this case , some of the behavior seen in figure [ fig : b2o ] could be caused by abundance gradients .",
    "there are several reasons to believe this is not the case .",
    "first , of the 11 stars in our sample ( table [ tab : abundances ] ) , 8 have galactocentric distances between 7.5 and 9.5 kpc , i.e. , they lie within 1 kpc of the solar circle . within this 2 kpc in galactocentric distance , the [ b / o ]",
    "abundance varies from @xmath45 to @xmath46 , i.e. , the abundance varies by a factor of 5 .",
    "thus , most of the trend seen in figure [ fig : b2o ] occurs within 1 kpc galactocentric distance of the solar circle and can not be caused by large - scale abundance gradients .",
    "second , there is evidence that the absorption along all of the sightlines actually arises within the first 1 - 2 kpc .",
    "most of the absorption seen in figure [ fig : spectra ] is at velocities that are consistent with nearby material , and given that typical cloud - to - cloud velocity dispersions are of order @xmath47 km  s@xmath19  ( sembach & danks 1994 ) , most of the gas is likely very local .",
    "for example , although the extended stis sightlines towards hd  177989 and hd  218915 pass over known spiral arms with prominent absorption in other species ( e.g. , , , , , and ) , there is no evidence for any absorption in the weak o@xmath12i  and b@xmath12ii  lines from those distant structures .",
    "the nearest arms probed along these sightlines are the perseus arm seen towards hd  218915 at a distance of @xmath48 kpc , and the sagittarius arm towards hd  177989 , which is likely at a distance of @xmath49 kpc .",
    "the perseus and sagittarius arms are seen seen in absorption in other species at @xmath50 km  s@xmath19  and @xmath51 km  s@xmath19  towards hd  218915 and hd  177989 , respectively .",
    "the relatively local origin of the gas towards hd  218915 may explain why it does not fit well the general trend with average sightline density seen in figure [ fig : b2o ] ( point 4 in this figure ) .",
    "one would prefer to use a more physically - meaningful measure of physical conditions such as the fraction of hydrogen in molecular form , @xmath52 .",
    "figure [ fig : fh2 ] shows the [ b / o ] abundances versus @xmath53  for those sightlines with @xmath54 measurements .",
    "this diagram is sparsely populated , but there seems to be a slight trend of increasing [ b / o ] abundance with decreasing @xmath53 .",
    "for this diagram to be truly useful , however , more @xmath55 measurements are needed .",
    "the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ will soon provide molecular hydrogen column densities for a large number of sightlines towards distant stars , making it possible to fill in the missing points in figure [ fig : fh2 ] .    the trend seen in figure [ fig : b2o ] , and the fact that the more distant stars studied by stis show higher [ b / o ] abundances , is likely caused by the heights of these stars above the plane of the galaxy . because the stars studied by stis are more distant , they generally lie at larger distances from the galactic plane than do the stars studied by the ghrs .",
    "thus , the sightlines probed by our stis measurements probe lower density regions , on average , than the sightlines probed by the ghrs measurements .",
    "the well - documented trend of higher gas - phase abundances of most elements in lower density regions suggests that we should expect the segregation of of stis and ghrs measurements observed in figure [ fig : b2o ] .    while the average sightline [ b / o ] values show a clear trend with @xmath35 , an imperfect measure of sightline properties , there is also evidence within the observed line profiles for variation of [ b / o ] with the physical properties of the absorbing material .",
    "several of the sightlines displayed in figure [ fig : spectra ] show evidence for dense clouds with lower b / o ratios than warm clouds along the same line of sight , in qualitative agreement with the jenkins et al . ( 1986 ) model of integrated sightline properties .",
    "figure [ fig : nav ] shows the apparent column density ( savage & sembach 1991 ) , or @xmath56 , profile of b@xmath12ii  @xmath57 towards hd  104705 with the corresponding @xmath58  profiles of o@xmath12i  @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "this sightline exhibits a narrow , cold component centered at @xmath61 km  s@xmath19 , which is prominent in species such as , , , and co , as well as a blend of warmer components between @xmath62 and @xmath63 km  s@xmath19  ( sembach , howk , & savage 2000 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : nav ] shows that the b / o ratio changes between these two regions .",
    "the integrated abundances in these two components are significantly different : @xmath64=-0.57{\\ensuremath{^{+ 0.12}_{- 0.16}}}$ ] for the component centered at @xmath65 km  s@xmath19 , and @xmath64 = + 0.08{\\ensuremath{^{+ 0.13}_{- 0.17}}}$ ] for the blend of warm components at negative velocities",
    ". this sightline exhibits variations in [ b / o ] that are coupled to real changes in the physical properties of the observed components .",
    "the dependence of [ b / o ] on @xmath35  could potentially be caused by other effects , including true abundance variations ( gas+dust ) and differential ionization ( e.g. , sembach et al . 2000 ) .",
    "boron may be particularly sensitive to the latter effect since its second ionization potential is high ( 25.15 ev , similar to that of ) .",
    "while the effects of differential ionization may modify the component - to - component b / o ratios , they are likely not large enough ( perhaps @xmath66 dex ) to cause the 0.8 dex range of [ b / o ] seen in figure [ fig : b2o ] .",
    "we believe the incorporation of boron into grains is dominant among the possible effects leading to the trend seen in figure [ fig : b2o ] .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that boron should be incorporated into dust .",
    "it has a condensation temperature ( @xmath67 k ; zhai 1995 ; lauretta & lodders 1996 ) similar to those of gallium and copper and is in the same group of the periodic table as aluminum and gallium , all of which are known to be significantly incorporated into interstellar dust ( hobbs et al .",
    "1993 ; savage & sembach 1996 ) .",
    "the cold cloud towards hd  104705 ( figure [ fig : nav ] ) shows a solar b / ga ratio , though the blend of warm components exhibits super - solar b / ga ratios .",
    "if the abundance variations between these regions are caused by the destruction of dust ( see savage & sembach 1996 ) , then boron is more readily - stripped from grains than is gallium .",
    "the gas - phase abundance measurements of boron in table [ tab : abundances ] yield no firm information on the solid - phase abundance of boron .",
    "we derive a lower limit to the present - day total ( gas+dust ) interstellar boron abundance of @xmath6 ( using the measured [ b / o ] towards hd  121968 and assuming @xmath68 = -0.34\\pm0.02 $ ] from meyer et al .",
    "1998 corrected for the morton 2000 o@xmath12i  @xmath41-value ) .",
    "the interstellar b / h is lower than the meteoritic abundances ( @xmath11 \\times{10^{-10}}$ ] ; anders & grevesse 1989 ) and non - lte abundances for stars of solar - like metallicity ( @xmath69 ; see discussion in lambert et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the probable incorporation of boron into interstellar dust makes it difficult to use the measured gas - phase interstellar boron abundance to study the influence of spallation on the chemical evolution of the light elements .",
    "another probe of spallation - induced chemical evolution is the @xmath7b/@xmath8b isotope ratio ( cf . , lambert et al .",
    "1998 ) , and some of the sightlines presented here might allow accurate measurements of this ratio with higher resolution or signal to noise .",
    "in fact , the sightline towards hd  104705 seems to show a high @xmath7b/@xmath8b ratio ; the red wing of b@xmath12ii  profile is very similar to that of the profile .",
    "however , the relative component structure seen in the @xmath58  profiles of b@xmath12iitowards hd  104705 , hd  177989 , and hd  218915 are significantly different than all of the other ionic species covered by our observations , including , , and .",
    "the depletion and/or ionization characteristics of b@xmath12ii  are disimilar to these species , perhaps making it inappropriate to use them as templates for b@xmath12iiwhen studying the @xmath7b/@xmath8b ratio along complicated sightlines .",
    "we have presented new and archival observations of the gas - phase abundance of boron in the diffuse interstellar medium using stis and ghrs . from our analysis of these high - quality absorption line data , and measurements from the literature ,",
    "we have concluded the following .    1",
    ".   the gas - phase abundance of [ b / o ] in the ism is anticorrelated with the average density of hydrogen along the sightline being probed , as well as the fraction of hydrogen seen in molecular form along a sightline . along individual sightlines",
    ", we also find a significantly higher gas - phase [ b / o ] abundance in warm than in cold diffuse clouds .",
    "the evidence strongly suggests that boron is incorporated into dust grains in the diffuse ism .",
