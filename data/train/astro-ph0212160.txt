    "one of the key questions facing astrophysics today concerns the epoch and mode of formation of the most massive elliptical galaxies . whilst the majority of galaxies can be easily accommodated by a slow assembly of galaxies from bottom - up , within the standard predictions of semi  analytical models of a cold dark matter universe @xcite , some lines of evidence suggest that an earlier and more dramatic formation mechanism may be necessary to accommodate ( some of ) the most massive galaxies . in particular : + _ 1 .",
    "powerful agn at high redshifts : _ the host galaxies of powerful radio sources are the most massive galaxies known at early cosmic epochs [ e.g. 3 ] , with stellar masses of a few times @xmath5 at redshifts @xmath6 @xcite . at higher redshifts ,",
    "even if fueled at the eddington limit , central supermassive black holes of @xmath7 are required to produce the observed radio luminosity , suggesting that massive galaxies are already in place at redshifts @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the nature of sub - millimetre selected galaxies : _ many of the powerful sub - mm selected galaxies seen with scuba are objects at @xmath9 , which are currently forming stars at hundreds or thousands of solar masses per year [ e.g. 6 ] .",
    "the k@xmath10 relation for these scuba galaxies indicates that these are amongst the most massive objects at their epoch @xcite .",
    "scuba galaxies therefore appear to be massive galaxies which are forming the bulk of their stars in a single dramatic starburst at high redshift .",
    "+ _ 3 . cluster galaxy scaling relations : _ the very low scatter found around the colour magnitude relation [ e.g. 8 ] and",
    "the fundamental plane ( a tight correlation between the surface brightness ( @xmath11 ) , characteristic radius ( @xmath12 ) , and velocity dispersion ( @xmath13 ) of cluster ellipticals , which can be roughly approximated as : @xmath14 ; e.g. 9 ) of elliptical galaxies in low redshift clusters imply a fairly high formation redshift of these ellipticals , with little bluening from later starbursting activity .",
    "the fundamental plane essentially measures the mass  to  light ( @xmath15 ) ratio of the galaxies ( from @xmath16 and @xmath17 it can be written as @xmath18 ) ; by comparing clusters at different redshifts [ e.g. 10,11 ] , the mass  to  light ratio is found to evolve very slowly with redshift out to @xmath19 , as @xmath20 .",
    "further , the scatter around neither the fundamental plane nor the colour  magnitude relation shows any significant increase out to redshifts @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "these results both further support the argument that the elliptical galaxies must have formed at a very early cosmic epoch , with limited later star formation ( although see @xcite for discussion of a possible ` progenitor  bias ' selection effect ) .",
    "+ _ 4 . the ages of massive ellipticals at high redshift : _ dunlop et  al . @xcite age  dated the old red elliptical galaxy 53w091 at @xmath22 through a detailed investigation of its optical spectral energy distribution .",
    "they derived an age of 3.5gyr , comparable to the age of the universe at that redshift , again implying a very early formation epoch .",
    "although there has since been considerable debate as to the age of this galaxy , and of the similar 53w069 , nolan et  al @xcite convincingly defend this initial age estimate .",
    "similar results are beginning to be obtained for extremely red objects ( eros ; e.g @xcite and refs therein ) .",
    "the identification of a sample of cluster elliptical galaxies at redshifts @xmath23 would provide a key opportunity to advance our understanding of the epoch and mode of formation of these objects .",
    "this is an early enough epoch to test the ` progenitor  bias ' model ( which would allow later star formation in cluster ellipticals ) , and would also offer a unique opportunity to compare , through age ",
    "dating techniques , the ages of the most luminous elliptical galaxies in the cluster with those of less luminous cluster ellipticals , and therefore directly observe whether there is an age  luminosity relation for cluster ellipticals .",
    "redshift 1.5 is a critical cosmic epoch for these studies : it is still sufficiently nearby that cluster ellipticals can still be identified on the basis of multi  colour imaging in a practical observing time , and is also an epoch where elliptical galaxies are still expected to be plentiful .",
    "in this article , the first steps to providing such a sample of elliptical galaxies are discussed .",
    "beyond redshift @xmath21 , the two well  known methods for identifying galaxy clusters , deep optical / near  ir imaging for galaxy overdensities , and x  ray detections of the hot intracluster medium , both start to become very expensive in terms of telescope time to achieve sufficient sensitivity for a wide survey area .",
    "for this reason , an alternative method has frequently been adopted : using targetted studies towards powerful agn . at low redshifts agn",
    "are often found in relatively rich environments [ e.g. 16 ] , and at redshifts @xmath21 numerous lines of evidence ( including detections of extended x  ray emission , overdensities of galaxies in narrow  band images or selected by infrared colour , cross  correlation analyses , and direct spectroscopic studies of individual sources ; see @xcite for a review ) indicate that at least some powerful radio sources are located at the centres of galaxy overdensities . at higher redshifts ,",
    "radio sources have been detected out to @xmath24 @xcite , with some sources spectroscopically confirmed to lie in overdense environments ( cf .",
    "kurk  & venemans , in this volume ) .",
    "this offers the prospect that agn can be used to pinpoint galaxy clusters back to the earliest epochs .",
    "we have embarked upon a project to investigate in detail the environments of a complete subsample of the most luminous radio sources from the equatorial brl sample of best  @xcite , within the narrow redshift range @xmath25 .",
    "the fields of 6 sources have been imaged in the @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 wavebands , using the sofi and susi-2 instruments on the ntt .",
    "this filter combination was chosen to provide maximal sensitivity to old cluster ellipticals with the @xmath26 and @xmath27 bands spanning the 4000  break and the @xmath28 waveband providing a long red baseline .",
    "the observations cover a field of view of 5 by 5 arcmins ( @xmath292.7 by 2.7 mpc at the radio source redshifts ) , and reach limiting depths of @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the k  band number counts in the fields of these radio sources are compared against the results of blank  field surveys in figure  [ fig1 ] ( left ) .",
    "the derived counts are fully consistent with the literature counts at magnitudes @xmath33 , which is the expected magnitude of brightest cluster galaxies at @xmath0 . at fainter magnitudes",
    "the galaxy counts still lie within the scatter of the other observations , but the counts in every magnitude bin from @xmath34 exceed the literature average by at least 1@xmath13 .    the @xmath26-@xmath28 colour distribution of the galaxies within 300kpc of the agn is displayed in figure  [ fig1 ] ( right ) , compared against the mean colour distribution for galaxies at greater than 1mpc radial distance from the agn in the same frames .",
    "there is a clear surplus of red ( @xmath35 ) galaxies .",
    "these results show that an excess of faint ( @xmath34 ) , red ( @xmath36 ) galaxies are found across the fields .",
    "these have the colours and magnitudes expected of old passive galaxies at the radio source redshifts .",
    "the radial distribution of the galaxies with these colours and magnitudes is investigated in figure  [ fig2 ] , for five of the radio source fields and for a combined histogram produced by averaging across all five fields . also included on these plots is the expected number density for blank - field sources of these magnitudes and colours ; this was calculated from the k20 @xcite and cadis @xcite surveys .",
    "the results from combining the five agn fields show that red galaxy excesses are seen on two different scales around the radio sources : there is a pronounced peak at small radii , @xmath37kpc , together with a larger scale overdensity extending across most of the field .",
    "these results are in broad agreement with those of @xcite ; however , with the larger radial coverage of the data provided here , it is now possible to quantify the radial extent of the large  scale overdensity ( which extended beyond their field of view ) : the galaxy counts remain above field expectations out to between 1 and 1.5mpc radius .    comparing the five individual fields in figure  [ fig2 ] , however ,",
    "it is immediately apparent that this combined result is the average of five fields with very different properties . 0016@xmath38129 and 2025@xmath38155 do both show radial distributions similar to the average result , with pronounced peaks in the inner bin followed by weak red galaxy overdensities to @xmath39mpc .",
    "0000@xmath38177 has a central pronounced peak of red galaxies , but shows no large  scale excess ( indeed quite the opposite ) . 0139@xmath38273 and 1524@xmath38136 are both much less centrally concentrated , with smoother central peaks and much more gradual radial declines in red galaxy surface density out to the blank  field expectations at radial distances of between 1 and 1.5mpc .",
    "there is clearly a large range in the nature , scale and significance of any red galaxy overdensities around these agn .",
    "scale galaxy overdensities have the appearance of forming clusters of galaxies .",
    "the wealth of galaxies around these agn with the magnitudes and colours expected of old elliptical galaxies at @xmath0 indicate that the epoch of elliptical galaxy formation must be earlier than this redshift ; the colours of these objects further suggest that the bulk of their stellar populations must have formed at redshifts @xmath8 . the large size ",
    "scale of these overdensities should not be surprising , since the timescale for objects of density @xmath40 to separate from the hubble flow and collapse is given by @xmath41 @xcite . for a proto - cluster , with @xmath42 collapsing from 3 - 5mpc radius",
    ", this corresponds to a collapse time of several gyr , and so such objects can not yet be fully collapsed by @xmath0 .",
    "the small  scale overdensities have the size of compact groups of galaxies , or of cluster cores . in the latter case",
    ", it is interesting that where small  scale overdensities are seen , almost all of the galaxies that comprise these have the red colours indicative of old passively evolving elliptical galaxies .",
    "this indicates that morphological segregation may already have taken place in the very inner regions around the agn , implying that the morphology  density relation [ e.g. 22 ] is imprinted into cluster centres at a very early epoch .    in conclusion , substantial overdensities of red galaxies with the colours , magnitudes and radial distribution expected of old passively evolving elliptical galaxies",
    "have been found around radio sources at redshifts @xmath43 .",
    "work is currently on  going to spectroscopically confirm the cluster membership of these galaxies , and to age their stellar populations , which will allow dramatic advances to be made in our understanding of how and when the most massive elliptical galaxies form ."
