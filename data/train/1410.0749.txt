    "we first notice that on dividing ( [ eq : p1])i ) by @xmath36 , differentiating in time , and using the calculus identity @xmath41 this shows @xmath42 where @xmath43=0 . % \\end{split } \\mathcal{r}(v ; t)\\equiv\\partial_t v-\\frac{1}{2}v^2.\\ ] ] next , integrating ( [ eq : eq0 ] ) from @xmath44 to @xmath7 ( or from @xmath45 to @xmath7 ) and using ( [ eq : truesol ] ) with boundary data @xmath46 , it follows that @xmath47 where we adopt the ( simplifying ) assumption that @xmath48 ( and subsequently to be consistent , @xmath49 ) .",
    "now , the schwarzian derivative of a function @xmath50 may be defined in terms of @xmath51 by @xmath52 and it has the property ( @xcite ) that @xmath53 if and only if @xmath54 and @xmath55 are related by a fractional linear ( mebius ) transformation , @xmath56 it follows from and that if we set @xmath57 and @xmath58 with @xmath59 , then @xmath60 for some functions @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",

    "now gives @xmath67 where @xmath68 and so at @xmath69 , @xmath70 where @xmath71    in contrast , equation implies @xmath72 which lets us combine equations , and to write @xmath39 in terms of initial and boundary data as @xmath73 giving @xmath74 from .",
    "we note that if we choose constant boundary data @xmath75 the final solution simplifies to @xmath76 which , clearly , will persist for all time if @xmath77 , for all @xmath78 $ ] , but will become singular in finite time provided @xmath79 for some @xmath80 more generally , since @xmath81 , monotonicity of @xmath82 implies @xmath83 as @xmath84 , where @xmath85 may , or may not , be bounded .",
    "equation then shows solutions persist for all time if @xmath86 while finite time blowup takes place if @xmath87 for some @xmath88",
    "here we briefly examine some possible types of nonsmooth structure of solutions from the formula given by ( [ eq : finalsolution ] ) .",

    "if we next denote the set , @xmath95 , by @xmath96    then , to be strictly valid , the solution formula requires that both a vertical and at least one horizontal characteristic avoid intersecting @xmath95 at any point @xmath97 prior to reaching @xmath98 , ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is not always possible , but the method used to construct formula above remains _ a posteriori _ valid at @xmath98 [ using vertical characteristics together with horizontal characteristics coming either from the left ( lines with constant @xmath99 which meet @xmath100 ) or from the right ( through a similar construction using periodicity of boundary data and meeting @xmath101 ) ] if one imposes appropriate conditions on the function @xmath9 .    a condition sufficient for formula to hold everywhere beneath @xmath95 ( both before and after solutions begin to develop singularities ) is for @xmath94 to be positive on only a single , open , connected set in @xmath8 on which it has a single maximum and no local minima . if one assumes that @xmath102 wherever @xmath103 and @xmath104 , then this suffices since @xmath105 and @xmath94 is consequently convex down at its extrema .    in order to consider the properties of non - characteristic curves in @xmath95 further , suppose in ( [ eq : finalsolution ] ) that the functions @xmath106 and @xmath107 are continuous for @xmath108 and set @xmath109 .",
