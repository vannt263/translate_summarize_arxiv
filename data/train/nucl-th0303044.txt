    "the investigation of the production of @xmath4 mesons in hadron and photon induced reactions provides direct access to low energy qcd dynamics .",
    "the intrinsic properties of the @xmath4 meson are dominated by the gluonic degrees of freedom and continue to attract theoretical and experimental interest since the first observation of @xmath4 mesons  @xcite in the reaction @xmath5 at lbl and bnl in 1964 .",
    "the mass of the @xmath4 meson is substantially larger than the ones of the other mesons from the pseudoscalar meson nonet .",
    "therefore , the @xmath4 meson could not be considered as pure pseudoscalar goldstone boson with a mass generated by spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "however , the strong chiral @xmath6 anomaly in qcd allows the @xmath4 meson to gain additional mass by different mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "the large mass of the @xmath4 meson can be viewed as being generated essentially by non - perturbative gluon dynamics and the @xmath6 axial anomaly .",
    "furthermore , an anomalous gluon not only generates a large @xmath4 meson mass , but also affects the dynamics of the @xmath4-nucleon interaction .",
    "the flavor singlet goldberger - treiman relation correlates  @xcite the @xmath4-nucleon coupling constant , @xmath7 , and the flavor singlet axial charge of the nucleon , @xmath8 , and in the chiral limit  @xcite one has @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the nucleon mass , @xmath11  gev renormalizes the flavor singlet decay constant  @xcite , and @xmath12 is the gluon - nucleon coupling  @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath8 can be decomposed in terms of the quark and gluon spin components of the proton  @xcite .",
    "unexpectedly , a very small value of @xmath13 was extracted from emc measurements  @xcite of the polarized proton structure function . in a naive parton interpretation ,",
    "i.e. neglecting the gluonic degrees of freedom by taking @xmath14 , the emc result indicates that the quark contribution to the proton spin , @xmath15 , is compatible with zero .",
    "this interpretation has supported speculations either about the validity of experimental results and data analysis or the applicability of perturbative qcd .",
    "alternatively , the spin crisis can be resolved by substituting a large positive value , @xmath16 , and substantial cancellation between the quark and gluon spin components .",
    "it was suggested  @xcite , that instead of the gluon component the contribution from the @xmath4 meson is canceled by the higher mass states , which are either radial excitations of the @xmath4 meson or glueball states .    at present , the two component interpretation of the axial charge is generally accepted .",
    "however , both @xmath7 and @xmath12 coupling constants are not known individually .",
    "the origin of the proton spin and its decomposition in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom still remain controversial .",
    "however , it is believed that the coupling constant @xmath7 defines up to large extent the total spin of the nucleon carried by its constituents .",
    "it is important to note that the coupling constant @xmath7 may experimentally be accessible in nuclear reactions involving the coupling between the @xmath4 meson and the nucleon .    the reaction @xmath17 was intensively studied at cosy  @xcite and saturne  @xcite .",
    "theoretical calculations  @xcite allow a description of the data entirely by the meson exchange currents .",
    "it was found that the contribution of the nucleon current to the @xmath4 meson production in proton - proton collisions is small .",
    "thus the reaction @xmath17 is not well suited for the direct evaluation of the coupling constant @xmath7 .",
    "additional measurements of differential cross sections and more detailed theoretical studies are necessary to determine under what conditions the nucleon exchange current may dominate the meson exchange or may be at least partially isolated .",
    "experimental information  @xcite about the reactions @xmath18 and @xmath19 is insensitive to the contribution from the nucleon exchange , although in principle these reactions would be well suited for the determination of the coupling constant @xmath7 . here",
    "the situation may be substantially improved with new and precise data for @xmath4 meson production at large angles , where the nucleon current dominates .",
    "the reaction @xmath20 was studied by a number of collaborations , namely abbhhm  @xcite , ahhm  @xcite and saphir  @xcite . while abbhhm and ahhm measured only the total cross section for the photoproduction of the @xmath4 meson at photon energies @xmath21  gev",
    ", the saphir collaboration at elsa studied the angular spectra of the @xmath4 mesons produced at photon energies @xmath22  gev .",
    "in addition , the photoproduction of @xmath4 mesons from the nucleon is presently experimentally investigated by the clas collaboration at tjnaf  @xcite and by the crystal barrel collaboration at elsa .",
    "currently experimental and theoretical  @xcite studies of the reaction @xmath0 are motivated by the possibility to investigate excited baryons coupled to the @xmath4 meson .",
    "assuming that the resonance production is the dominant contribution , an isobar analysis  @xcite of the saphir data shows that the @xmath4-photoproduction at photon energies @xmath22  gev can be described by the coherent excitation of two resonances , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "however , the presently available data  @xcite for the @xmath4-photoproduction are quite limited .",
    "thus , an evaluation of resonance properties from these data should be considered with caution .",
    "it is also clear that the contribution from the meson exchange current to the reaction @xmath20 can not be completely neglected , as was shown in the analysis of the reaction @xmath17 .",
    "here we investigate up to what extent present data for the reaction @xmath0 can be described by the exchange of vector mesons in the @xmath25 channel and the nucleon exchange in the @xmath26 and @xmath27 channels .",
    "we do not consider contributions from baryonic resonances with masses above the production threshold .",
    "if possible resonances will significantly contribute to the production mechanism , then a discrepancy between our calculation and data should indicate this .",
    "in addition , we aim to investigate the conditions under which the nucleon exchange current can be well controlled , and whether the reaction @xmath20 may be used to better determine the coupling constant @xmath7 .",
    "one of the well established results in particle physics is that for very high energies , i.e. @xmath285  gev , regge trajectories provide the dominant processes for peripheral reactions . at energies well below 5  gev , but still clearly above the resonance region the photoproduction of mesons can be described the @xmath25 channel meson exchanges . in our case",
    "the photoproduction of the @xmath4 meson is dominated by the exchanges of the @xmath2 and the @xmath1 meson .",
    "the relevant feynman diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "[ diagram1 ] .",
    "the four momenta of the initial nucleon and photon and the final nucleon and @xmath4 meson are denoted as @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "we use the mandelstam invariants to define the reaction kinematics and invariant reaction amplitudes , namely @xmath33 the relation between the four momentum transfer squared and the scattering polar angle @xmath34 is given as @xmath35 thus , @xmath4 meson photoproduction at backward angles , @xmath361 , corresponds to the maximal four momentum transfer squared , -@xmath25 , and increases with increasing the photon energy @xmath37 .",
    "moreover the maximal @xmath25 corresponds to the minimal value of @xmath38 . at the production threshold for @xmath4 mesons",
    "the squared invariant collision energy is given by @xmath39 , and the invariant @xmath25 takes the form @xmath40 from eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) it is obvious , that already at the reaction threshold the @xmath4 meson photoproduction probes large @xmath41 .",
    "thus , the @xmath2 and @xmath1 meson exchanges should be very sensitive  @xcite to the choice of the form factors at the nonlocal interaction vertices .",
    "the shaded area in fig .",
    "[ prim6 ] shows the range of the four momenta transfer squared @xmath25 accessible in the reaction @xmath42 at a given photon energy @xmath37 , or at a given squared invariant collision energy @xmath26 .",
    "the figure shows clearly that for the energies available at elsa and tjnaf , namely @xmath43  gev , the photoproduction of @xmath4- mesons probes large @xmath41 up to @xmath44 - 3  gev@xmath45 .",
    "furthermore , it is important to notice that uncertainties in the @xmath25-channel contributions due to unknown coupling constants and form factors can be eliminated through data collected at energies slightly beyond the resonance region . here",
    "the @xmath25-channel contributions dominate at the low four momentum transfer squared .",
    "we also note that at high energies , @xmath465  gev , the elementary particle exchange should be generalized to the correct expression for the exchange of a regge trajectory with physical coupling constants comprising the residue @xcite .",
    "thus , the availability of precision data at photon energies @xmath47  gev is very crucial for the theoretical analysis of @xmath25-channel exchanges .",
    "the effective lagrangian densities used for the evaluation of the vector meson ( @xmath48 ) exchange amplitudes are given as  @xcite @xmath49 here @xmath50 stands for the mass of the @xmath4 meson , @xmath10 for the mass of the nucleon .",
    "the vector meson field tensor is given by @xmath51 , and @xmath52 with @xmath53 being the photon field .",

    "the ratio of the tensor to vector coupling is 6.1 for the @xmath2 meson and zero for the @xmath1 meson .",
    "the couplings for the @xmath63 and @xmath64 vertices can be evaluated from the partial decay widths of the reactions @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the two quantities are related by @xmath67 where @xmath68 , with @xmath69 being the electromagnetic coupling . with @xmath70  kev and @xmath71  kev",
    "we obtain @xmath72=1.36 , and @xmath73=0.4 .    the form factors at the @xmath63 and @xmath64 vertices are not fixed by the model .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ prim6](a ) , the @xmath4- meson photoproduction probes a large region of @xmath41 . thus we expect that our calculations may be very sensitive to the choice of the unknown form factor at the @xmath74 vertex . moreover , because of an anomalous gluon component , the structure function of the @xmath4 meson is different from the one for mesons which are built up from quark - antiquark configurations . in a meson exchange model",
    "the intrinsic structure of the @xmath4 meson enters effectively through the form factors at the @xmath63 and @xmath64 vertices , which do not necessarily have to be of the standard monopole or dipole type  @xcite . in principle , the form factor at large @xmath41 is given by the meson structure function at short distances and in case of @xmath4 meson might be defined through its gluon component .    for our calculations",
    "we adopt an exponential form factor @xmath75 with @xmath76  gev@xmath77 being our best choice value obtained by adjusting to the @xmath4 meson photoproduction data .",

    "the exponential form factor is renormalized to @xmath79 at @xmath80 , where @xmath81 being the @xmath2 meson mass .",
    "while the exponential and monopole form factors are almost identical for small @xmath41 , i.e. @xmath82  gev@xmath45 , the difference at large @xmath25 is quite obvious .    finally , the four lorentz and gauge invariant amplitudes  @xcite for the reaction @xmath83 due to the vector meson exchanges are given as @xmath84 it is understood that each amplitude contains in addition the product of the form factors at the @xmath85 and @xmath74 vertices .",

    "[ prim5a ] and [ prim7a ] we display the differential cross sections for the reaction @xmath20 measured by the saphir collaboration at elsa  @xcite .",
    "we choose to plot the cross section @xmath88 instead of the angular spectra  @xcite , since in this case the slope with respect to @xmath25 explicitly indicates the strength of the form factor .",

    "[ prim1 ] as function of the invariant collision energy @xmath95 .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath94 here does not represent the magnitude of the differential cross section at @xmath96 , as can be well understood from fig.[prim6 ] , but an extrapolated value .    within experimental uncertainties",
    "the slope @xmath93 does not depend on the energy and can be well fitted by a constant value @xmath97  gev@xmath77 , as is shown by the solid line in fig.[prim1](b ) .",
    "the @xmath25 dependence at low four momentum transfer squared beyond the resonance region is dominated by the vector exchange contribution .",
    "therefore , the slope @xmath98",
    "gev@xmath77 at @xmath992  gev can be linked to the form factor at the @xmath63 and @xmath64 vertices .",
    "possible contribution from other @xmath4 meson photoproduction mechanisms might change the slope @xmath93 at lower energies . if the @xmath4 meson couples to additional resonances , the exponential slope of @xmath25 dependence may increase or decrease in the resonance region , depending whether an interference between the resonant and vector meson exchange contributions is destructive or constructive .",
    "the size of the change of the slope with the photon energy will depend on the strength of the resonance coupling to @xmath4 meson .",

    "we also want to compare our calculation based on an exponential form factor @xmath100 to a calculation , where we employ a standard monopole form factor at the @xmath102 and @xmath103 vertices . the dashed lines in figs .  [ prim5a ] and [ prim7a ]",
    "show such a calculation with a cut - off parameter @xmath1041.5  gev at the @xmath102 and @xmath103 vertices .",
    "this value is identical to the one at the @xmath105 and @xmath106 vertices .",
    "we see that a calculation with a monopole form factor at the electro - magnetic vertices can not reproduce the @xmath25 dependence of the @xmath4 meson photoproduction data especially at photon energies above 1.7  gev .",
    "it should not be surprising , that form factors as the vertices with the vector mesons coupling to the nucleon are different from the ones where the vector mesons couple to the photon , since the internal structure of those vertices is different .",
    "the comparison between the saphir data  @xcite and our calculations based on vector meson exchange as sole production mechanism leads to the following conclusions .",
    "first , a comparison of the calculations to the data for small photon energies , @xmath107  gev , shows some room for a possible contributions from @xmath26 wave resonances .",
    "however , we do not see much room for the contribution from the @xmath108 wave resonance , which must introduce an additional @xmath25 dependence .",
    "second , the differential cross section at @xmath109  gev seems to indicates some enhancement at maximal @xmath25 or small @xmath38 , which can not be explained by considering vector meson exchange alone .",
    "indeed , this enhancement may point to the importance of considering the nucleon exchange as part of the production mechanism .",
    "the possibility of studying excited baryons which couple to the @xmath4 meson in the in the reaction @xmath83 initiated considerable theoretical activity  @xcite , in which contributions from a number of resonances were introduced .",
    "for example , the approach of refs .",
    "@xcite , based on effective lagrangians , considers nine baryonic resonances in different partial waves . these are two @xmath110 resonances as @xmath111 and @xmath112 , three @xmath113 resonances as @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 , two @xmath117 resonances , @xmath115 and @xmath118 and one @xmath119 resonance , @xmath120 .",
    "contributions from only the @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 resonances are discussed in the regge model calculation of ref .",
    "in contrast , the quark model calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite considers only a @xmath3 resonance .",
    "because of the large uncertainties in the experimental results and the very limited number of experimental points  @xcite presently available for the reaction @xmath83 , we prefer to introduce as few resonances into our calculation as possible .",
    "it is also clear , that large uncertainties in the selection of the parameters of potential resonances , i.e. mass and width , the coupling to the @xmath4 meson as well as our lack of knowledge about relevant form factors at the resonance vertices might provide quite a large freedom in describing the present data by isobar contributions .",
    "having this in mind , and considering our results from figs .",
    "[ prim5a ] and [ prim7a ] , we see that we mostly underpredict the present data close to the reaction threshold .",
    "overall , we find that the data can be reasonably well described by a single production mechanism , namely the exchange of vector mesons .",
    "it is also clear that this exchange of vector mesons can be reggeized  @xcite , providing it is applicable at the very high energies .",
    "thus , concluding from fig .",
    "[ prim1 ] we only have room for additional contributions at photon energies @xmath124  gev , or at invariant collision energies below 2  gev . furthermore , since the slope @xmath93 of the @xmath25 dependence does not change at @xmath124  gev , we also do not see room for the contribution from any @xmath108 wave ( or higher partial wave ) resonances .    a closer look at fig.[prim1](a ) reveals , that this possible additional contribution dominates already at the @xmath4 meson photoproduction threshold , @xmath125  mev , decreases with increasing photon energy and almost vanishes for @xmath126  mev . since the differential cross section , @xmath88 , given in eq.([xvect ] ) does not contain a final phase space factor , the constants @xmath94 can be considered as being proportional to the squared averaged reaction matrix element , which has a maximum value at threshold and saturates with increasing the photon energy . thus we guess that energies with @xmath127  mev ( see fig.[prim6](a ) ) are influenced by the tale of a resonance which has a pole at or below the @xmath4 meson photoproduction threshold .",
    "since there are little constraints on resonances coupled to the @xmath4 meson , different choices of @xmath26 wave resonances having masses below 1896  mev are in principle possible . in general , the interaction lagrangians for a @xmath128 nucleon resonances are given as  @xcite @xmath129 where @xmath130 denotes the resonance mass , @xmath131 the field operator of the resonance , and @xmath132 and @xmath133 are the isoscalar and isovector transition magnetic couplings .",
    "the vertex functions for nucleon resonances @xmath131 with negative parity are @xmath134=1 and @xmath135 , while resonances with positive parity have @xmath136 and @xmath1371 .",

    "we take @xmath144=2.3 .",
    "the couplings of the @xmath4 meson to baryon resonances , @xmath145 , are generally unknown and can only be adjusted to data . in our calculation a value @xmath146=3.4 is adopted .",

    "[ prim5b ] in comparison to the data for photon energies @xmath154  gev .",
    "the dashed line represents the calculation with the vector meson exchange alone .",
    "the resonant contribution dominates around the @xmath4 meson photoproduction threshold and vanishes with increasing the photon energy .    concluding this section we want to emphasize that our calculations do not prove that resonant contributions to the @xmath4 meson photoproduction are not necessarily only those from the @xmath3 resonance .",
    "large uncertainties in selection of the coupling constants @xmath155 to resonances as well as in cutoff parameters @xmath152 allow sufficient freedom to consider more resonant contributions .",
    "however , in this work , we did not prefer to include any other resonance than @xmath3 .",
    "since the mass of the @xmath4 meson is close to the nucleon mass , the range of the squared four momentum @xmath27 available in the reaction @xmath83 is almost the same as the range of the variable @xmath25 as is indicated in fig .",
    "[ prim6 ] . as @xmath156 approaches its minimal value , the contribution from the nucleon exchange increases due to the @xmath27 dependence of the squared nucleon propagator , @xmath157 .    to map out the @xmath27 dependence of the differential cross section , it is worthwhile to perform the measurements at sufficiently large photon energies , which provide access to a wide range of @xmath27 .",
    "in addition , at large energies the separation between the @xmath25 and the @xmath27 channel becomes more pronounced . at the same time , the @xmath26 channel contribution from the nucleon exchange is small because of the @xmath26 dependence of the squared nucleon propagator , @xmath158 .",
    "obviously , baryon resonances may also contribute at small @xmath38 .",
    "however , they contribute at the same time to the @xmath26 channel and fill the gap between small @xmath25 and small @xmath27 . though it may not be possible to evaluate resonance properties unambiguously from the data , the overall resonant contribution can be fitted , as we illustrated in the previous section .",
    "thus the resonant background to the @xmath27 channel nucleon exchange contribution can be well estimated and subtracted .    in general , the contribution from the nucleon",
    "exchange current can be measured at small @xmath27 or at backward angles in meson photoproduction reaction .",
    "obviously , the size of the contribution will depend on the strength of the coupling of the @xmath4 meson to the nucleon .",
    "in fact , such an increase of the differential cross section at small @xmath27 was detected in the photoproduction of @xmath159 and @xmath1 mesons  @xcite .",

    "for example , in @xmath181 scattering the gluon - nucleon interaction generates a contact term and may reduce the extracted value of the @xmath161 coupling constant .    neglecting the gluon - nucleon coupling @xmath12 in eq.([gd ] ) one can estimate the @xmath161 coupling constant as @xmath187 .",
    "this value can be considered as quite small , as we discussed in the introduction . on the other hand ,",
    "the ozi predictions  @xcite for the axial charge of the nucleon , neglecting the polarized strange quark and gluon contributions to the internal spin structure of the nucleon , gives @xmath188 .",
    "attributing this value to the @xmath161 coupling constant one can estimate @xmath189 .",
    "the more careful analysis  @xcite based on the goldberger - treiman relation for the axial charge gives @xmath190    for our calculations we adjust the coupling constant @xmath191 within the above listed boundaries to the data and use @xmath192 .",
    "the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ prim8 ] shows our calculations for the @xmath4 photoproduction cross section based on the contribution from the vector meson exchange , the @xmath3 resonance and the nucleon exchange current .",
    "as we can see , the quality of the presently available data , especially at large @xmath41 , is such , that it is not useful to estimate any uncertainty of value of @xmath7 .",
    "however our calculations presented in fig .  [ prim8 ] clearly illustrate that the differential cross section for @xmath4 meson photoproduction at small @xmath38 or at large scattering angles can be used for a determination of the @xmath191 coupling constant .",
    "our goal was to describe the reaction @xmath193 from threshold to photon energies @xmath37=2.4  gev .",
    "first we studied the contribution from vector meson exchange in the @xmath25 channel to the @xmath4 meson photoproduction cross section . with this , the presently available data from the saphir collaboration at elsa  @xcite can be well reproduced for photon energies @xmath194  gev to 2.4  gev .",
    "the discrepancy between our calculation based on vector meson exchange alone and the data at small photon energies , @xmath195  gev , may be attributed to contributions of resonances .",
    "an analysis of the data in terms of the energy dependence of the extrapolated forward differential cross section @xmath88 supports the assumption that this additional contribution results from a resonance with a mass below the @xmath4 meson production threshold .",
    "thus we include the well established @xmath3 nucleon resonance into our calculation .",
    "finally we can describe the available data for @xmath196  gev quite well .",
    "however we note , that with the presently available data we can not conclude that the @xmath3 resonance is the only one that contributes to the reaction @xmath20 .    as last step we investigated the contribution from the nucleon exchange to the reaction @xmath20 .",
    "the aim is to see whether this contribution can be detected experimentally .",
    "our calculations show that the nucleon exchange contribution dominates at small @xmath38 for photon energies @xmath194  gev .",
    "our speculation is that an experimental measurement under the above kinematical conditions can be used for a better evaluation of the contribution from the nucleon exchange , which in turn allows to obtain the @xmath191 coupling constant . because of the large uncertainties of available estimates for the @xmath191 coupling constant and its importance for the clarification of proton spin crisis problem  @xcite , a precise measurement of the @xmath4 meson photoproduction at large angles is crucial .",
