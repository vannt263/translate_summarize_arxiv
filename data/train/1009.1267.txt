    "<S> the fragmentation of quasi - projectiles from the nuclear reaction @xmath0+@xmath1 at 25 mev / nucleon was used to produce excited states candidates to @xmath2-particle condensation . </S>",
    "<S> the experiment was performed at lns - catania using the chimera multidetector . accepting the emission simultaneity and equality among the @xmath2-particle kinetic energies as experimental criteria for deciding in favor of the condensate nature of an excited state </S>",
    "<S> , we analyze the @xmath3 and @xmath4 states of @xmath5c and the @xmath6 state of @xmath7o . </S>",
    "<S> a sub - class of events corresponding to the direct 3-@xmath2 decay of the hoyle state is isolated .    </S>",
    "<S> alpha particle condensed states have been predicted to exist in self - conjugate 4n nuclei in the vicinity of the @xmath8-decay threshold and are characterized by a low density @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical predictions agree that the most probable candidate states correspond to the hoyle state and @xmath4 state of @xmath5c @xcite and to the @xmath6 state of @xmath9 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if confirmed , these states should be regarded as the finite size replica of 4-nucleon clusterization taking place in dilute symmetric nuclear matter @xcite .    from the experimental point of view , a candidate for @xmath2-particle condensation is a resonant state whose excitation energy is close to the @xmath8 threshold and which directly decays into @xmath8 of equal kinetic energies ( in the center of mass of the emitter ) . once agreed on these criteria , it comes out that , probably , the most appropriate working methodology involves full 4@xmath10 detection of energetic reaction products . </S>",
    "<S> high angular granularity is an extra requirement for having high kinematic resolution and detection efficiency .    </S>",
    "<S> data discussed in this paper have been collected in the nuclear reaction @xmath11ca+@xmath5c at 25 mev per nucleon incident energy and correspond to quasi - projectile ( qp ) decay events . </S>",
    "<S> the experiment was performed at lns - catania ( italy ) , using the chimera @xcite multidetector . </S>",
    "<S> details of the experimental settings and methods for reaction product identification and calibration may be found in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    the overall quality of the energy calibration was judged based on the energy evaluation of several resonant states of light nuclei inferred from two particle correlation functions ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) @xcite . taking into account the complexity of the apparatus and the fact that the maximum obtained deviation was of 20 kev , </S>",
    "<S> the calibration was considered reliable enough to allow for the due spectroscopic analyses .    </S>",
    "<S> correlation functions are known to reveal also space - time information on the decaying source taking advantage of proximity effects induced by coulomb repulsion and to highlight the production of event classes with specific properties . </S>",
    "<S> their predictive power is now exploited in order to qualify the simultaneity / sequentiality character of a specific state decay . </S>",
    "<S> let us define a generalized correlation function in terms of @xmath2-particle average kinetic energy and rms , @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 represent respectively the correlated and uncorrelated number of events corresponding to given values of @xmath18 , and see how does it look like for 3-@xmath2 decay events .    </S>",
    "<S> the left panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : hoyle ] presents the intra - event correlation function corresponding to the qp events with @xmath19 and @xmath20 mev , where @xmath21 is the alpha multiplicity and @xmath22 denotes the excitation energy of the assumed decaying state . as one may notice , around the energy of the hoyle state above the @xmath23 threshold two peaks </S>",
    "<S> are observed . </S>",
    "<S> the first one , characterized by @xmath24 kev and @xmath25 kev , corresponds , within our energy uncertainty ( calibration and direction of velocity vectors ) , to the equal sharing of the available energy of the hoyle state among the three @xmath2-particles . </S>",
    "<S> the second peak localized around @xmath26 kev and @xmath27 kev corresponds to the sharing of the available energy between the two @xmath2s of @xmath28be and the remaining @xmath2 of 191 kev . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations filtered by the software replica of the detector confirm these preferential populations of the bi - dimensional event representation . </S>",
    "<S> even more , in the sequential decay case , they allow us to detect the relative angle between the velocity vectors of the @xmath2s originating from @xmath28be and the one of @xmath28be . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the extreme case in which the three @xmath2s are flying along the same direction produces a peak centered at ( @xmath29130 kev , @xmath30 85 kev ) while the region around ( @xmath2990 kev , @xmath31 60 kev ) is populated when the two @xmath2s of @xmath28be are emitted on a direction perpendicular to the one of @xmath28be .    </S>",
    "<S> the competition between direct and sequential decay of the hoyle state previously reported by freer @xcite is testified also by the dalitz plot ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : hoyle ] , right panel ) which clearly manifests the typical pattern of each decay mechanism .    </S>",
    "<S> both methods allow for an estimation of the relative probability of a sub - class of events with respect to any other . </S>",
    "<S> let us focus on the particle condensation candidates . </S>",
    "<S> they correspond to the events localized at ( @xmath24 kev , @xmath25 kev ) whose number is 39 . taken into account that the total number of events with ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 mev ) is 1072 and the number of events with ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath20 mev ) is 900 it comes out that 2% of the populated hoyle states are compatible with @xmath2-particle condensation .    </S>",
    "<S> the same analyses may be performed in the case of the region around the @xmath4 state at 9.6 mev of @xmath5c . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2nd ] illustrates the intra - event correlation function and dalitz plot corresponding to the 1.5@xmath34 events with @xmath19 and @xmath35 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation function shows a broad peak which lies along the line of maximum rms compatible with momentum conservation . </S>",
    "<S> the dalitz plot manifests the symmetric three - bump structure typical for sequential decays . out of this </S>",
    "<S> , it comes out that no evidence is found in favor of condensation compatible states in this case .    </S>",
    "<S> the intra - event correlation method , not restricted by the number of involved particles , has been applied also to 4@xmath2-events . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , poor statistics prevents us from drawing a definite conclusion . </S>",
    "<S> we nevertheless mention that 4 states compatible with the above stated criteria of condensation have been identified . </S>",
    "<S> a dedicated experiment is planned in the near future .    to summarize , for the first time we have found experimental evidence in favor of the @xmath2-particle condensate nature of the hoyle state of @xmath5c . </S>"
