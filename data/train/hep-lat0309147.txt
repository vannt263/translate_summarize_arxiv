    "the result for the expectation value of the polyakov loop correlator is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is dedekind s function .",
    "the term associated with the minimal world sheet surface induces the exponential area - law fall off , and the consequent linear rise in the interquark potential @xmath11 . the first non - trivial contribution in @xmath1 results in the determinant of the laplace operator , and the corresponding contribution to the interquark potential @xmath11  in a regime of distances shorter than @xmath12  is the lscher term @xcite : @xmath13    further terms in the expansion of the nambu ",

    "@xcite , can be treated by means of a perturbative expansion in @xmath15 ( a parameter proportional to the coefficient of such a term ) , which induces a leading order correction like @xcite : @xmath16 with a short distance contribution to @xmath11 : @xmath17 .",
    "we run numerical simulations of @xmath0 lattice gauge theory in three space - time dimensions @xcite .",
    "we chose this model because the effective string picture is believed to be independent of the underlying gauge group , and @xmath0 gauge group is interesting from the point of view of the _ center relevance _ in confinement .",
    "moreover , the duality with the ising spin model and a novel algorithm allow us to reach high precision results .",
    "the pure 3d lattice gauge model is described in terms of @xmath18 variables defined on the lattice bonds .",
    "the dynamics is governed by the standard wilson action , which enjoys @xmath0 gauge invariance .",

    "this model is _ dual _ with respect to the @xmath0 ising spin model in 3d .",
    "the ratio of polyakov - loop correlators @xmath23 in the gauge model can be expressed as a ratio of partition functions @xmath24 in the spin model : @xmath25 the index @xmath26 means that links perpendicular to an @xmath26 plane have an antiferromagnetic coupling constant .",

    "a `` purely classical '' area law is definitely ruled out , and the lo term alone is not sufficient to describe the data .",
