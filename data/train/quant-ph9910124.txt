    "a central problem of quantum information processing is to ensure that devices which have been designed to perform certain tasks still work well in the presence of decoherence , i.e. , under the combined influences of inaccurate specifications , interaction with further degrees of freedom , and thermal noise .",
    "decoherence typically has the effect of producing mixed states out of pure states , so it is natural to ask whether the effects of decoherence can be partially undone , by processes turning mixed states into purer ones . as in the classical case",
    "this is impossible for operations working on single systems .",
    "however , if many ( say @xmath0 ) systems are available , all of which were originally prepared in the same unknown pure state @xmath1 , and subsequently exposed to the same ( known ) decohering process @xmath2 , then an analysis of the combined state may well allow the reconstruction of the original pure state .",
    "the quality of this reconstruction will increase with @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , it should approach perfection as @xmath3 : in this limit one can determine the decohered state @xmath4 to an arbitrary accuracy by statistical measurements .",
    "the question is only , whether the knowledge of the full density matrix @xmath4 admits the reconstruction of @xmath1 , i.e. , whether the linear operator @xmath2 is invertible .",
    "generically , and for sufficiently small decoherence , this is the case . however , the operator @xmath5 is usually not positive , i.e. , it takes some density matrices into operators with negative eigenvalues .",
    "therefore , it does not correspond to a physically realizable apparatus .",
    "but it does describe a computation we can perform to reconstruct @xmath1 from the measured ( or estimated ) density matrix @xmath6 .",
    "how well can this reversal of decoherence be done when the number @xmath0 of inputs is given , and finite ?",
    "the answer depends critically on the way the purification task is set up , and what `` figure of merit '' we try to optimize . in general",
    ", the resulting variational problems may be very hard to solve .",
    "however , in the specific model situation chosen in this paper , the solution is fairly straightforward : we take qubit systems , and assume that decoherence is described by a depolarizing channel of the form @xmath7 the purifier will be a device @xmath8 taking a state of @xmath0 qubits , and turning out some number @xmath9 of qubits , where @xmath9 may be either fixed or itself a random quantity . in the latter case @xmath8",
    "is given mathematically by a family @xmath10 of completely positive maps , where @xmath10 takes a density matrix of @xmath0 qubit systems , and produces a positive operator on the @xmath9 qubit space , which is not necessarily normalized to unity : the normalization constant @xmath11 is interpreted as the probability of getting exactly @xmath9 outputs from the input state @xmath12 .",
    "thus @xmath13 .",
    "our aim is to design @xmath8 to get outputs as close as possible to the uncorrupted input state @xmath1 , and also as many of them as possible .",
    "this is reminiscent of cloning problems @xcite .",
    "however , in cloning problems the aim is to get many copies of the input state to @xmath8 , which in our case is the mixed state @xmath4 , rather than the pure state @xmath1 . in both cases",
    "there is clearly a trade - off between the quality of the outputs and their number , which is why there are several different ways to state the problem . in the sequel",
    "we will briefly describe the variants of the purification problem , together with the results , which will be shown later in the paper .    1 .",
    "[ it:0 ] _ maximal fidelity , failure to produce any output admissible .",
    "_ the best fidelity of outputs is clearly achieved , when the weakest possible demands are made on the number of outputs . in this case we do not even insist on an output every time the device is run , but only on some non - zero probability for getting an output .",
    "the best achievable fidelity of these outputs goes to @xmath14 as @xmath3 , but not substantially faster than with the following stronger requirement on output numbers . 2 .   [ it:1 ] _",
    "@xmath15 fixed , number @xmath9 never increased at expense of output purity .",
    "_ this is the approach taken by @xcite .",
    "at least one output qubit is required , and the figure of merit is based on the fidelity of this one qubit . as it turns out the optimal device for this problem can just as well produce more outputs of the same optimal fidelity , with a certain rate . however , this rate is not part of the optimization criterion .",
    "@xmath9 fixed , purity measured by one - particle restrictions . _ for fixed @xmath16 ,",
    "this problem is rather similar to [ it:1 ] .",
    "however , with the additional parameter @xmath9 we can discuss better the trade - off between rate and quality of outputs .",
    "suppose we fix some dependence of the number of outputs @xmath17 on the number of inputs .",
    "do the states still approach @xmath1 as @xmath3 ? clearly , if @xmath17 increases slowly , e.g. , at the rate given by the optimal device from [ it:1 ] , this will be the case .",
    "what may seem surprising at first , however , is that _ no matter _ how fast @xmath18 , the state of each output qubit still approaches the uncorrupted pure state . in this sense ,",
    "optimal purification works with an _ infinite rate_. 4 .",
    "@xmath9 fixed , purity measured by fidelity with respect to @xmath19 . _",
    "the infinite rate depends critically on what we use as the quality criterion for outputs .",
    "apart from the fidelity of the restrictions of the output state to single qubits used in [ it:2 ] we could also look at the fidelity of the outputs with respect to the @xmath9 particle pure state @xmath20 , thereby taking into account also the correlations between different outputs . for fixed @xmath9",
    ", the difference between these two fidelity measures does not seem so great , because one can be estimated in terms of the other .",
    "however , the estimates are @xmath9-dependent ( see below ) , and hence for problems involving a limit @xmath21 the fidelity with respect to the combined state may ( and does ) turn out to be a much tighter criterion .",
    "in fact , no process with finite rate @xmath22 achieves fidelity@xmath23 , and in this sense even optimal purification works with _ zero rate _ , in sharp contrast to [ it:2 ] above . on the other hand , for any finite fidelity requirement",
    ", there is an output rate for an optimized process , which is computed below .",
    "these results will be stated in precise terms in the following section  [ sec : merit ] , together with the notation needed for that purpose , and graphs of the optimal fidelities and rates .",
    "the proofs follow in the subsequent sections .",
    "technically they hinge on the decomposition theory of tensor product representations of su(2 ) , and this background is provided in section  [ sec : decomp ] .",
    "the reason for representation theory to enter in such a crucial way is isolated in section  [ sec : decomp - reduc ] , where it is shown that the optimal devices can be taken to be su(2)-covariant ( do not single out a basis in the qubit space ) .",
    "the two basic purifiers , called the `` natural purifier '' ( optimal for question [ it:1 ] above ) , and the `` optimal purifier '' ( optimal for question [ it:2 ] above ) are defined in section  [ sec : natur - optim - purif ] , and their fidelities are computed . the proof of the optimality claims is given in section  [ sec : solut - optim - probl ] . finally , in section  [ sec : asympt ]",
    ", we determine the asymptotic behaviour for the optimal purifier , and the output rates .",
    "in this section we will state the optimization problems for purifiers mathematically . a device ( not necessarily a purification procedure ) taking @xmath0 qubit systems as input and producing @xmath9 output qubits",
    "is described mathematically by a trace preserving , completely positive linear map ( `` cp - map '' ) @xmath24 which takes input density matrices to output density matrices .",
    "equivalently , we may work in the heisenberg picture , using the dual @xmath8 of @xmath25 , the _ unital _ ( i.e. @xmath26 )",
    "cp - map @xmath27 which is related to @xmath25 by @xmath28",
    ". here @xmath29 is the one qubit hilbert space , @xmath30 is the space of all ( bounded ) operators on the corresponding hilbert space and @xmath31 denotes the space of trace class operators . since @xmath32 , the spaces @xmath33 and @xmath34 are just the @xmath35-matrices , but it is nevertheless helpful to keep track of the distinction between spaces of observables and spaces of states .",
    "`` good purifiers '' should make @xmath36 very close to @xmath20 .",
    "a simple figure of merit is the fidelity of the output with respect to the desired state in the worst case , i.e. , @xmath37 where the infimum is over all one - particle pure states @xmath1 .",
    "similarly , we could pick any one of the outputs , say the one with number @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and test its fidelity .",
    "the worst case then gives the fidelity @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the tensor products with @xmath42 factors `` @xmath43 '' and one factor @xmath1 at the @xmath44 position .",
    "we seek to maximize these numbers by judicious choice of @xmath8 .",
    "let us denote the optimal values by @xmath45 where @xmath46=``all '' or @xmath46=``one '' , and the supremum is over all unital cp - maps @xmath8 with the specified number of inputs and outputs .    for devices with _",
    "variable numbers of outputs _ all these quantities become random variables , as well . typically , one will seek to optimize the mean fidelity .",
    "it is then natural not to take the infimum in equation ( [ fone ] ) , but the mean .",
    "the case where no output is produced at all , is interpreted here as one output qubit in the completely mixed state .",
    "the resulting _",
    "mean fidelity _ @xcite can be thought of as the fidelity @xmath47 of a modified device @xmath48 , which uses @xmath8 , followed by a random selection of one of the outputs .",
    "therefore , the problem of maximizing mean fidelity is exactly the same as maximizing @xmath49 for devices with fixed output number @xmath15 , with optimal value @xmath50 .    rather than looking at the mean of the fidelity distribution of a device with variable number of outputs",
    "we could also look at its maximum .",
    "this corresponds to the problem in item  [ it:0 ] of the previous section .",
    "more precisely , one should omit the `` worst case '' infimum with respect to @xmath38 in this case , and allow the device to either pick one of its outputs , or to declare failure .",
    "this leads to a device with only the two output numbers @xmath51 and @xmath14 , and the functional to be optimized is the fidelity of the `` @xmath14''-output .",
    "we will denote the optimum for this problem by @xmath52 , with a slight abuse of notation expressing that this is the case with no demands on output numbers at all .",
    "it is clear that @xmath50 is a decreasing function of @xmath9 , and that therefore the limit @xmath53 exists . for @xmath46=all ,",
    "this limit is zero .",
    "however , for @xmath46=one , it is an interesting quantity , which even goes to @xmath14 as @xmath3 .",
    "the results for the quantities @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 are shown in figure  [ fig : one ] .",
    "of course , all these quantities also depend on the parameter describing the noise , which we have suppressed for notational convenience .",
    "it is fixed in the following graphs as @xmath57 ( resp .",
    "@xmath58 , see section  [ sec : decomp ] ) .",
    "it is clear that @xmath59 for any @xmath0 and @xmath9 , as the noise level goes to zero ( @xmath60 ) .",
    ", middle : @xmath55 , bottom : @xmath56 ]    the leading asymptotic behaviour ( as @xmath3 ) is of the form @xmath62    from these asymptotic results , a simple estimate for the all - particle fidelity criteria can be obtained : by equation ( [ fone<>fall ] ) , @xmath63 , where @xmath9 is the number of outputs .",
    "hence , for sufficiently small rate @xmath22 one achieves good fidelity , even for the all - particle test criterion : @xmath64 .",
    "of course , the second estimate is rather crude , and a refined version will be given in section  [ sec : asympt ] .",
    "the argument does show , however , that one may expect optimal all - particle fidelity to become a function of the output rate .",
    "this function will be computed in section  [ sec : asympt - all ] ) : for every @xmath65 , we find the limit @xmath66 the function @xmath67 is continuous and satisfies @xmath68 and @xmath69 , so at small rates purification is near perfect , but becomes arbitrarily bad at too high rates . in figure  [",
    "fig : alltest ] @xmath67 is plotted with the noise parameter @xmath70 going in steps of @xmath71 from @xmath51 to @xmath14 .",
    "the dotted line describes the performance of the natural purifier ( see section  [ sec : natpur ] ) , which operates with rate @xmath72 .",
    "for the all - particle figure of merit ( [ eq:20 ] ) .",
    "curve parameter : @xmath73 ; dotted line : natural purifier ]",
    "many arguments in this paper are based on group theory , in particular the decomposition of tensor products of irreducible representations of @xmath74 . in this section",
    "we will summarize the relevant results which are needed throughout the paper .",
    "there are two reason why group theory is useful for us .",
    "first of all the depolarizing channel @xmath75 producing the noise is `` covariant '' which means that it does not prefer any particular polarization direction ( basis in the underlying hilbert space @xmath76 ) , and second we are looking at a `` universal '' purification problem , i.e. the purification devices @xmath8 we are looking for should work well on an arbitrary unknown input state @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , it is natural to look at those @xmath8 which are covariant as well : @xmath8 should work in exactly the same way on any input .",
    "carrying this idea further it should also be impossible to single out any one of the input and output channels .",
    "mathematically , these `` natural conditions '' are stated as follows :    [ def : full - sym ] a unital , cp - map @xmath77 is called _ fully symmetric _",
    "if it is @xmath78 covariant , i.e. @xmath79 and permutation invariant , i.e. @xmath80 and @xmath81 here @xmath82 , @xmath83 denote permutations of @xmath9 respectively @xmath0 elements and at the same time the corresponding unitaries on @xmath84 and @xmath85 , i.e. @xmath86 .",
    "we could have made this condition part of our definition of a purifier , and restricted the discussion to fully symmetric operations from the outset .",
    "however , we have chosen to take the heuristic arguments at the beginning of this section more seriously : the kind of `` universality '' described there is already embodied in the figures of merit of section  [ sec : merit ] , so it becomes a mathematical question whether optimal purifiers are indeed fully symmetric or else symmetry is broken , and a non - symmetric purifier can outperform all symmetric ones .",
    "we now argue that the _ optimal _ devices ( with respect to @xmath87 and @xmath88 ) may be indeed by assumed to be fully symmetric . to make this precise",
    ", note that @xmath89 and @xmath90 are infima over expressions which are linear in @xmath8 , and hence concave functionals .",
    "therefore , averaging over many @xmath8 s with the same figure of merit produces a @xmath8 at least as good . clearly , for all permutations @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath91 , the purifier @xmath92 has the same figure of merit as @xmath8 . by averaging over these parameters ( with respect to the appropriate haar measures ) we thus find a purifier , which is at least as good as @xmath8 and , in addition , fully symmetric .",
    "similar arguments apply for purifiers with variable numbers of outputs ( although one has to be more careful in defining figures of merit ) .",
    "therefore , we will restrict our discussion to fully symmetric purifiers from now on .",
    "the reduction to fully symmetric purifiers allows the application of techniques from group theory ( especially representation theory of @xmath74 ) which simplifies our problems significantly .",
    "consider in particular the @xmath93fold tensor product @xmath94 of the spin-@xmath95 , or the `` defining '' representation @xmath96 .",

    "consider now a general qubit density matrix @xmath12 , which in its eigenbasis can be written as @xmath108 @xmath109 the parametrization of @xmath12 in terms of the `` pseudo - temperature '' @xmath110 is chosen here , because it is , as we will see soon , very useful for calculations .",
    "the relation to the form of @xmath111 initially given in equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) is obviously @xmath112 the @xmath0fold tensor product @xmath113 can be expressed as @xmath114 where @xmath115 denotes the 3component of angular momentum in the representation @xmath116 . in other words ,",
    "the density matrices are just analytic continuations of group unitaries , or `` su(2)-rotations by an imaginary angle @xmath117 '' .",
    "this reduces the decomposition of @xmath118 to the decomposition ( [ eq : pidecomp ] ) of the tensor product representation .",
    "of course , analytically continued group elements are not normalized as density operators .",
    "extracting appropriate normalization factors the decomposition becomes @xmath119 } w_n(s ) \\rho_s(\\beta ) \\otimes             \\frac{{\\if11\\idty\\else\\mathbb{1}\\fi}}{\\dim { \\mathcal{k}}_{n , s}},\\ ] ] with @xmath120 and @xmath121 here @xmath122 denotes again the 3component of angular momentum , now in the representation @xmath100 .",
    "the @xmath123 are normalized , i.e. @xmath124 . hence @xmath125 and @xmath126 due to the normalization of @xmath127 .",
    "together with the fact that the multiplicities @xmath128 are independent of @xmath110 we can extract from equation ( [ eq:2 ] ) a generating functional for @xmath129 : @xmath130}\\sinh\\bigl((2s+1)\\beta\\bigr)\\dim{\\mathcal{k}}_{n , s}\\\\     = \\bigl(e^\\beta - e^{-\\beta}\\bigr)\\bigl(e^\\beta+e^{-\\beta}\\bigr)^n     & = \\sum_{s \\in i[n]}\\left(e^{(2s+1)\\beta}-e^{-(2s+1)\\beta}\\right )         \\dim{\\mathcal{k}}_{n , s},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] obtaining @xmath131 provided @xmath132 is integer , and zero otherwise .",
    "the same result can be derived using representation theory of the symmetric group ; see @xcite , where the more general case @xmath133 is studied .",
    "let us come back now to fully symmetric cp - maps @xmath134 . using the results of subsection [ sec : decom - oper ] it is easy to see that @xmath8 can be decomposed into a direct sum @xmath135 } t_s(a ) \\otimes { \\if11\\idty\\else\\mathbb{1}\\fi}\\ ] ] where the @xmath136 are unital cp - maps which are again fully symmetric ( using an obvious modification of definition [ def : full - sym ] ) .",
    "identifying , as in subsection [ sec : decom - oper ] , the representation space @xmath102 with the @xmath105fold symmetric tensor product @xmath137 , leads to the significantly simpler problem of decomposing fully symmetric , unital cp - maps @xmath138 , which is already solved in @xcite .",
    "hence we will state only the corresponding results here .",

    "<S> however , if only a fidelity close to 1 is required , the optimal purifier achieves a positive rate , which we compute . </S>"
