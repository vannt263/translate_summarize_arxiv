    "exotic nuclei are a result of movement away from the valley of stability towards the drip line regions , where the increase in neutron ( or proton ) excess and low binding energy changes the nuclear structure , and leads to unconventional properties for the nuclei concerned .",
    "some of these exotic nuclei exhibit special character and are known as halo nuclei @xcite .",
    "nuclear halos are , essentially , a threshold effect occurring because of the presence of a bound state near the continuum in the energy spectrum @xcite and as expected , neutron halos are more pronounced than proton halos owing to the large coulomb barrier in the latter case .",
    "characterized by a large spatial and hence , a small momentum distribution , they reveal interesting aspects about two- and three - body ( borromean ) systems @xcite .",
    "though they are highly unstable in most cases , the fact that they have non - negligible reaction rates in stellar plasma @xcite has garnered the interest of experimentalists all over the world @xcite .",
    "considerable interest has also been shown in exotic - halo nuclei ever since they first came to light @xcite .",
    "the theoretically explained models of the various reaction cycles , viz .",
    "_ pp-__chains , cno cycle , the _ r_- , and _",
    "s_-processes , etc . , led to the study of nuclei near the drip line in the medium mass region as they are also speculated to form connecting links within these chains which produce energy to power the stars @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors explicitly state that it would be wise to carry out detailed research with exotic nuclei in the medium mass region .",
    "though these drip line halo nuclei have indeed been studied quite extensively for lower atomic masses @xcite , the same , however , can not yet be said about the medium mass region , where investigations have been comparatively fewer , but equally important nevertheless .",
    "as has been customary with exotic nuclei , the studies in this region near the drip line @xcite have shown interesting characteristics in terms of their ground state configurations .",
    "ground state ( g.s . ) configurations are important as their knowledge can lead one to the information about the isospin dependence of effective nuclear interaction , variation in the traditional shell structure or vanishing of the shell gaps , because even the ` magic numbers ' valid for the valley of stability get modified away from it @xcite .",
    "normally , the nucleons inside the nucleus are expected to fill up according to the conventional shell model , but near the drip line the usual shell gaps break .",
    "conventionally , one would expect the domination of the @xmath7 orbit to form the ground state in nuclei in the vicinity of _",
    "n _ = 20 - 28 .",
    "this would mean a large centrifugal barrier with _",
    "this does not favour the formation of halos as they are characterized by small angular momentum values ( _ l _ = 0 , 1 ) to limit the effect of centrifugal barrier @xcite . nevertheless , in the ` island of inversion ' @xcite , rapid changes in the shell structure lead to configuration mixing due to the @xmath8 intruder configurations , with @xmath9 representing the neutron .",
    "this configuration reversal results in a deformation in the nuclei away from the valley of stability .",
    "deformation could be a factor for heavier nuclei surviving within the neutron drip line in this region @xcite .",
    "lying close to the drip line in this region , @xmath0na is such a nucleus .",
    "the progress in experimental technology over the years has made it possible to show that the one neutron separation energy ( @xmath10 ) for @xmath0na is ( 0.17 @xmath11 0.50 ) mev @xcite , whereas the national nuclear data centre ( nndc ) database @xcite shows it to be @xmath12 ( 0.80 @xmath11 0.008 ) mev .",
    "evidently , the uncertainty in the value can not be ignored .",
    "besides , its ground state spin - parity and shape ( spherical or deformed , and oblate or prolate if the latter ) have also not yet been established .",

    "f_-wave dominant @xcite .",
    "this knowledge is important because very weakly bound deformed nuclei in the island of inversion with significant @xmath13 contribution could generate halos and @xmath0na is a strong candidate for both . besides , the separation energy of a nucleus can also be used to calculate its matter radius @xcite which can then be used to determine its shape .",
    "further , @xmath0na is expected to be an innate fragment in the alternate _",
    "r_-process paths where light to medium mass neutron rich nuclei play an important role either as or in the production of seed nuclei @xcite .",
    "@xmath14na is supposedly the most abundant isotope of na near the neutron drip line and as such , binding energies of @xmath0na and @xmath14na are important to find their reaction rates for their production and consumption in stellar environments .    in this paper",
    "we use the method of coulomb dissociation ( cd ) under the aegis of the post - form finite range distorted wave born approximation ( frdwba ) theory @xcite to evaluate different reaction observables for @xmath0na .",

    ", we apply the frdwba theory to calculate various reaction observables like total cross - sections , relative energy spectra , momentum and angular distributions , etc . , and investigate the possible allowed ground state configurations for @xmath0na along with its binding energy .",
    "the post - form of the theory is fully quantum mechanical and includes the non - resonant continuum up to all orders .",
    "the only input that it requires is the ground state wavefunction of the projectile @xcite .    in the next section we present our formalism , while in section [ sec:3 ] we show the results and discussion for the various quantities calculated for the reaction considered .",

    "the investigations are done for @xmath3na@xmath80 @xmath5 _ @xmath6 _ configuration as the ground state of @xmath0na .",
    "unlike the transverse momentum distributions , pmds are relatively insensitive to the nuclear interaction and beam energy controlling the breakup @xcite , and if narrow , reflect an extended spatial distribution via heisenberg s uncertainty principle .",
    "we observe narrow parallel momentum distributions which point to broader spatial distributions .",
    "it is evident from the figure as well as from the values in table [ t3 ] that deformation in the nucleus makes the full width at half maxima ( fwhm ) of the distributions narrower ( the peak height rises with increase in deformation ) .",
    "but the fwhm value even for zero quadrupole deformation is @xmath8144 mev / c ( the half - maximum width for established halos like @xmath82be and @xmath83c @xcite ) , suggesting that @xmath0na is indeed halo , even in the absence of any deformation and if at all , its halo character only increases with increasing @xmath52 .    the neutron energy - angular distribution for our breakup reaction is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : 6 ] for which the neutron angle , @xmath84 , was fixed at @xmath85 to correspond to the case of near or below the grazing angles in the forward direction .",
    "similar to the case of the momentum distributions , the amplitude increases with increase in the value of @xmath78 .",
    "the increase in amplitude confirms the narrowing of the fwhm of the distribution peaks obtained .",

    "irrelevant of deformation , the peak position in the fig .",
    "[ fig : 6 ] almost coincides with the beam energy .",
    "this is an indication that there should be no post - acceleration effects for the charged fragment @xcite .",
    "no post - acceleration effect is another feature in the breakup of halo nuclei @xcite .",
    "post - acceleration , from semiclassical arguments @xcite , should come to light with increase of average momentum @xcite of the charged fragment with the scattering angle . to check that",
    ", we calculated the average momentum of @xmath3na and plotted it with respect to its scattering angle in fig .",
    "[ fig : 7 ] .",
    "according to the semiclassical point of view , coulomb repulsion effects on the charged fragment increase with decreasing of the impact parameter .",
    "this is expected because classically , as the scattering angle , @xmath86 , increases , impact parameter decreases , resulting in an increased coulomb repulsion from the target nucleus",
    ". however , fig .",
    "[ fig : 7 ] depicts that the average momentum of the @xmath3na fragment is almost saturated for the very forward angles .",
    "even as the angle increases , the percentage change in the average momentum is extremely small , indicating that the breakup distance is still large so that the @xmath3na fragment is not accelerated on its way out .",
    "hence , post - acceleration may be ruled out .",
    "the variation of average momentum with binding energy of the valence neutron only results in an increase in its absolute value while essentially reproducing similar curves .    the neutron angular distribution for the breakup is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : 8 ] .",
    "one notices that the differential cross - section falls steeply as the neutron angle increases in the forward direction .",
    "the effect of deformation is seen to be prominent at very forward angles .",
    "the constricted angular distributions for coulomb breakup of @xmath0na below grazing angles can also be used to study its halo effect @xcite .",
    "narrow angular distributions are in agreement with smaller widths of parallel momentum distribution @xcite which further boosts the impression that @xmath0na could be a halo nucleus .",
    "in the present work , we try to analyse the halo character of @xmath0na while calculating different reaction observables if it undergoes elastic coulomb breakup when bombarded on @xmath2pb at 100 mev / u and in doing so , try and get a better understanding of its one neutron separation energy and ground state configuration .",
    "we apply the coulomb dissociation method under the patronage of the finite range distorted wave born approximation extended to include the effects of deformation in an approximate way .",
    "this theory requires only the ground or the bound state wavefunction of the projectile and includes the entire non - resonant continuum .",
    "we are able to factorize the reduced transition amplitude into a structure part and a dynamics part .",
    "the theory , with and without the inclusion of deformation , has been used in the past to study various nuclei as well as their radiative capture reactions @xcite .",
    "our results , combined with the patterns detected in the medium mass region of ` island of inversion ' with _ n",
    "_ = 20 - 28 , augment the speculation that @xmath0na has a dominant _ p_-state configuration , which also support the suggestions by refs .",
    "moreover , there are chances that more often than not we would encounter a halo nucleus in this region .",
    "the halo structure of @xmath0na is manifested via the narrow longitudinal momentum distributions with decreasing fwhm values for increasing values of deformation , and is further corroborated by its forward peaked angular distributions .",
    "the average momentum calculations along with the energy - angular distributions show that the breakup of @xmath0na on @xmath2pb was free from post - acceleration effects .",
    "the one neutron removal cross - section observed can be equated with future experimental data to put more stringent bounds on the one neutron removal energy value and the ground state configuration ( whether it is an _",
    "s- , p- _ or an _ f_- wave ) .",
    "in fact , these limits can further be improved using the relative energy spectra results whose peaks varied with defromation .",
    "the peak position of relative energy spectra can be used in future for scaling purposes . at this beam energy range ( @xmath87 a few hundred mev / u ) ,",
    "the final channel fragments are usually easier to detect as they are ejected with higher velocities .",
    "this facilitates measuring coulomb dissociation observables like the angular distributions or the relative energy spectra , using which one would be able to put constraints on spectroscopic factors .",
    "the relative energy spectra can also be used with the principle of detailed balance to find the relevant @xmath3na@xmath88na radiative capture cross - section to different possible low - lying states of @xmath0na .",
