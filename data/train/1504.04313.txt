    "<S> in view of the proliferation in the number of new charmonium states , it is really important to have a experimental way to prove that an observed bump is , indeed , a real resonance . to do that , </S>",

    "<S> the phase variation of a generic complex amplitude can be directly revealed through interference in the dalitz - plot region where it crosses a well established resonant state , used as a probe . </S>",
    "<S> we have tested the method for the @xmath0 state by generating monte carlo samples for the @xmath1 decay channel . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the proposed method gives a clear oscillation behavior , related to the phase variation associated to a real resonant state , in the case where the @xmath0 is considered as a regular resonance with a strong phase variation . </S>",
    "<S> we have also discussed the possibility of using the proposed method complementary to the argand diagram to determine the internal structure of the @xmath0 state .    </S>",
    "<S> several experiments operating during the last decade , mainly babar at slac and belle at kek , cleo - iii and cleo - c at cesr , cdf and d  at fermilab , besiii at ihep and lhcb and cms at cern , have vastly increased the available data on new charmonium - like states , called @xmath2 and @xmath3 states . among these states , the charged are the most interesting ones , since they can not be simple @xmath4 states . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath5 , found by belle collaboration in 2007 , was the first observed one @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the minimal quark content of this state is @xmath6 this can only be achieved in a multiquark configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the babar collaboration searched for the @xmath0 signature in four decay modes and concluded that there is no significant evidence for a signal peak in any of these processes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , very recently the belle and lhcb collaborations have confirmed the @xmath5 observation and have determined the preferred assignment of the quantum numbers to be @xmath7 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> curiously , the first evidence of this resonance in the @xmath8 channel was reported only this year by belle collaboration @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath5 observation motivated further studies of other @xmath9 decays and , in 2008 , belle collaboration reported the observation of other two resonance - like structures , called @xmath10 and @xmath11 , in the exclusive process @xmath12 , in the @xmath13 mass distribution  @xcite . once again </S>",
    "<S> the babar colaboration did not confirm these observations @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> following these observations , from march to october of 2013 four more charmonium charged states were reported . </S>",
    "<S> the first one was the @xmath14 , observed almost at the same time by besiii @xcite and belle@xcite collaborations , in the @xmath15 mass spectrum of the @xmath16 decay channel . </S>",
    "<S> this structure was also confirmed by the authors of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite using cleo - c data .    soon after the @xmath14 observation , the besiii related the observation of other three charges states : @xmath17 @xcite , @xmath18 @xcite and @xmath19 @xcite . up to now </S>",
    "<S> it is not clear if the states @xmath14-@xmath19 and the states @xmath17-@xmath18 are the same states seen in different decay channels , or if they are independent states .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , in august 2014 the @xmath20 was reported by belle collaboration in the @xmath21 channel of the @xmath22 decay , with a 6.2@xmath23 significance . as in the case of the @xmath5 , </S>",

    "<S> so many non confirmed ( nc ) states in table  [ spec ] , it is really important to have a experimental way to prove that an observed excess of events is , indeed , a real resonance . in particular , bumps close to the threshold of a pair of particles should be treated with caution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> sometimes they are identified as new particles , but they can also be a reflection of a resonance below threshold . as an example , in the case of the @xmath19 , it was shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that the signal reported in @xcite could be also described by a @xmath54 resonance with a mass around 3875 mev and width around 30 mev . </S>",
    "<S> also , in the case of the @xmath17 , it was shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that both , a resonance with @xmath24 or a bound state with @xmath55 , are compatible with the data from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> besides , it was also shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that the experimental data can also be explained with just a pure wave - d background . in the case of the @xmath5 , since its mass is close to the @xmath56 threshold , it was suggested that it could be a @xmath24 @xmath57 molecular state @xcite or a cusp in the @xmath58 channel @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the first attempt to demonstrate the resonant behavior of the @xmath5 state was done by lhcb in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where a fit was performed in which the breit - wigner amplitude was replaced by a combination of independent complex amplitudes at six equally spaced points in @xmath59 range covering the @xmath5 peak region . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting argand diagram is consistent with a rapid phase transition at the peak of the amplitude , just as expected for a resonance . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite a similar method was applyed to show the resonant behavior of the @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> the breit - wigner amplitude was replaced by a combination of constant amplitudes , with six bins in @xmath61 range covering the @xmath60 peak and two independent sets of constant amplitudes , to represent the two helicity amplitudes of the @xmath20 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> the results in the argand diagram for @xmath63 clearly shows a resonancelike change of the amplitude absolute value and phase . </S>",
    "<S> however , they argue that because of the argand diagram for the @xmath62 amplitudes has much larger relative errors , it was not possible to draw any conclusions from it . in any case , the argand plot approach , proposed by lhcb experiment , needs a high statistics sample to be able to give , in a undoubted way , the confirmation of the phase variation expected for a regular resonant state .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we propose a different method to demonstrate the resonant behavior of a state . </S>",
    "<S> it is a simple experimental method isobar - based amplitude difference ( ad ) , that can be used to extract the phase motion of a complex amplitude in three - body heavy - meson decays @xcite . with this method </S>",
    "<S> , the phase variation of a generic complex amplitude can be directly revealed through interference in the dalitz - plot region where it crosses a well established resonant state , used as a probe . </S>",
    "<S> this method was successfully applied to fermilab e791 data @xcite to extract the well known phase motion of the scalar amplitude @xmath64 observed in 3pi decay . </S>",
    "<S> it was also successfully used to extract the phase motion , of a resonant scalar amplitude @xmath65 in 3pi decay @xcite , to confirm previous evidences of the existence of a light and broad scalar resonance presented by fermilab experiment e791 @xcite .    in full dalitz plot analyses , each possible resonance amplitude is represented by a breit - wigner function multiplied by angular distributions associated with the spin of the resonance . </S>",
    "<S> the various contributions are combined in a coherent sum , with complex coefficients , that are extracted from fits to the data . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute value of the coefficients are related to the relative fraction of each contribution and the phases take into account the final state interaction ( fsi ) between the resonance and the third particle .    </S>",
    "<S> amplitude difference method has a different approach . </S>",
    "<S> it concentrates in a particular region of the dalitz plot , where the amplitude under study crosses a well known resonance amplitude , called probe amplitude , represented by a breit - wigner . </S>",
    "<S> the phase variation of the complex amplitude can be directly revealed through the interference , in the dalitz - plot region , where they cross each other .    </S>",
    "<S> there are two necessary conditions to extract the phase motion of a generic amplitude with the ad method :    * a crossing region between the amplitude under study and a probe resonance has to be dominated by these two contributions . </S>",
    "<S> * the integrated amplitude of the probe resonance must be symmetric with respect to an effective mass squared ( @xmath66 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> these two conditions are very well satisfied in many charmonioum three body @xmath67 decays , where the phase space is large and the charmonium candidates are located in the central region of the dalitz plot , possibly crossing with well stablished resonances . </S>",
    "<S> the probe resonances are , in general , placed at low @xmath68 , @xmath69 or @xmath70 invariant mass . as a consequence , the charmonioum amplitude candidates must cross basically all phase space , or at least the low @xmath68 region , to be observed by the ad method . therefore , </S>",
    "<S> if the amplitude under study is due to a molecular state , this method may not apply . </S>",
    "<S> indeed it was shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that a loosely bound molecular state can only exist when the relative momentum between the two mesons in the molecule is small . </S>",
    "<S> this means that this state will appear basically only the middle of the dalitz plot and may not cross the probe resonance . </S>",
    "<S> this will exclude the direct observation of the phase variation of molecular states with the ad method .    with the two conditions above </S>",
    "<S> , we can examine the @xmath71 decay ( where @xmath72 represents @xmath73 or @xmath74 ) , and write down an amplitude with two components : one representing the probe resonance , @xmath75 , placed in the dalitz variable @xmath76 through a breit - wigner and the angular distribution , and the other , representing the resonance under study , which we call generically by @xmath3 decaying in @xmath77 or @xmath78 , placed in the dalitz variable @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> this simple amplitude must be used only in the small part of the phase space where the interference between them occurs . since </S>",
    "<S> the last one can have different dynamical origins , it can be written in a most generic way as : [ az ] a^z(s_13)=(s_13 ) e^i(s_13 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this unitary equation is able to represent amplitudes with slow phase variation , as well as resonances with a large phase variation , of the order of @xmath80 , around the nominal mass of the resonance , in the same way as the argand plot used by lhcb @xcite . the total amplitude for the @xmath71 decay , in the small part of the phase space where the interference between the resonances @xmath81 and @xmath82 occurs , can be written as @xcite : @xmath83 where @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the helicities of the lepton pair , the @xmath75 and @xmath3 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we take the amplitudes of the decays @xmath87 and @xmath88 from @xcite : a^k^*_&=&h^k^*_a^k^*(s_12)d^1_0 ( _ k^*)e^id^1 _ ( _ ) , + a^z_&=&h^z_a^z(s_13)d^1_0 ( _ z)e^id^1_ ( _ ) e^i . </S>",

    "<S> [ def - al ] using eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ akz ] ) and ( [ def - al ] ) , we can write @xmath111 therefore , |a(s_12,s_13,)|^2 & = & ( a^k^*_)^2|a^k^*(s_12)|^2 + ( a^z_)^2(s_13)+2a^k^*_a^z_(s_13 ) m_0_0(s_12-m_0 ^ 2)^2+m_0 ^ 2_0 ^ 2 , [ a22 ] where we have used eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ az ] ) and ( [ ak ] ) and we have defined : @xmath112 .    the expression in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ a22 ] ) is very similar to the one obtained in @xcite , for two scalar resonances . </S>",
    "<S> for small @xmath109 , @xmath113 can be considered as a symmetric function , therefore : @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is small . </S>",
    "<S> also , in the small part of the phase space where the interference between the @xmath75 and the @xmath3 occurs , we can suppose that all the angles are almost constant . </S>",
    "<S> consequently the difference of the amplitudes squared takes the simple form : @xmath116 where @xmath117 .    using eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ a2 ] ) and ( [ del ] ) we can write the difference of the amplitudes squared : [ eq : sim ] ^2= ( m_0 ^ 2 + , s_13)^2- ( m_0 ^ 2 - , s_13)^2=_=-1,1_^2=_=-1,1c _ ( ( 2 ( s_13)+ _ ) - _ ) , where @xmath118 and @xmath119 are taken from data . </S>",
    "<S> the above equation can , finally , be rewriten as : [ fi ] ^2= ( 2(s_13))_=-1,1c _ _ + ( ( 2(s_13))-1)_=-1,1c _ _ . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath120 , in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fi ] ) , directly reflects the behavior of @xmath121 . a constant @xmath122 would imply a constant @xmath121 , and this would be the case of non - resonant contribution . </S>",
    "<S> in the same way , a slow phase motion will produce a slowly varying @xmath123 and a full resonance phase motion produces a clear signature in @xmath123 with the presence of zero , maximum and minimum values .    to clarify these possible behaviors of @xmath123 and shown the statistic feasibility of the ad method </S>",
    "<S> , we perform a simple monte carlo study . to do that we generated two monte carlo samples of @xmath1 decay channel , each one with a sample of @xmath124 events with relative fractions 0.86 and 0.08 respectively for the @xmath125 and @xmath126 contributions , similarly to the observed by the lhcb experiment with 3 fb@xmath127 accumulated data  @xcite . in the first sample the @xmath0 enters as a regular resonance with a strong phase variation , represented by a breit - wigner , while in the second , @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> is represented by a real bump amplitude with no strong phase associated . </S>",
    "<S> to simplify this study we use only one helicity of the lepton pair in eq.([eq : sim ] ) and assume that in the little phase space crossing region both amplitudes do not have a significant variation due to the angular distribution . in both cases we assume zero phase difference between these amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> finally we do not include background components in our simulation .    </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , this particular distribution is determined by the phase difference between the two amplitudes . here </S>",
    "<S> we assume zero , but any other possible value to this phase difference produces the same signature : positive , negative and zero regions along the crossing region . the @xmath123 distribution for the second monte carlo sample , with no phase variation associated to the @xmath0 around the @xmath128 mass region , is shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> we have indetified the need to have a direct confirmation of these states through the study of the phase variation associated to a real resonant state . </S>",
