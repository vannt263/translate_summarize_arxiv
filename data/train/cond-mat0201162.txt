    "the critical treatment of the generally accepted theory of thermo - e.m.f . in bipolar semiconductors",
    "was presented in theoretical works by gurevich _ et el._@xcite the calculations were carried out without recombination term ( the scope of those papers was intentionaly limited to explain the correct definition of thermo - e.m.f . ) .",
    "we will continue our constructive criticism ( as we will offer some practical solutions ) with following , never - discussed facts .",
    "the first of them is related to applied temperature difference .",
    "as soon as we have the temperature gradient , both electrons and holes diffuse from the hot end of the sample to the cold one . as a result ,",
    "electron and hole concentrations should increase on the cold end of the sample if recombination processes are ignored ( usually they even were not discussed in the study of thermoelectric phenomena,@xcite and corresponding terms were not presented in the equations .",
    "therefore one can say that recombination was ignored . ) .    as a consequence ,",
    "the well known correlation@xcite @xmath0 is violated , where @xmath1 , @xmath2 are equilibrium electron and hole concentrations at some equilibrium temperature , @xmath3 is the intrinsic concentration in the same semiconductor .",
    "the fact that eq .",
    "( [ ec : conc ] ) be correct , is based on the existence of common fermi levels for electrons and holes and the equality @xmath4 always suits in this case .",
    "here @xmath5 , @xmath6 are electron and hole chemical potentials in equilibrium state , @xmath7 is the energy gap .",
    "so if equation ( [ ec : conc ] ) is not fulfilled , then @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the non - equilibrium electron and hole chemical potentials .",
    "this means that the common fermi level is splited and two fermi quasi - levels ( electron and hole ) originate .    since the internal thermoelectric field",
    "is determined by the gradient of electrochemical potential,@xcite the question that immediately arose was : which field shall we use to calculate thermo - e.m.f .",
    ": @xmath11 or @xmath12 ?",
    "here , @xmath13 is the electrical potential caused by the redistribution of electric charges in the thermal field , and @xmath14 is the electron charge .",
    "besides , recombination processes shall be taken into account if there appear non - equilibrium carriers .",
    "the second aspect is related to the way that thermo - e.m.f .",
    "is usually calculated in an open circuit . at the same time",
    ", it is well known that the correct definition of e.m.f . of any nature",
    "shall be related to a closed circuit .",
    "this circumstance is especially important to determine thermo - e.m.f . in bipolar semiconductors .",
    "it is enough to imagine the particular special situation with inhomogeneously heated @xmath15-type semiconductor closed with the metal section of circuit .",
    "there are no holes in the metal and there are no electrons in a @xmath15-type semiconductor .",
    "the explanation of this phenomena can not be defined within the limits of thermoelectric traditional theory .",
    "it is clear that it is necessary to use boundary conditions taking into account current flux and surface recombination processes .",
    "nobody had done that before .",
    "the third aspect is that the consideration of thermo - e.m.f . in bipolar semiconductors",
    "is carried out , usually , after the study of this problem in unipolar semiconductors , and many results are obtained `` by analogy . ''",
    "methodically it ought to be done starting from `` point zero '' to avoid a series of mistakes and incorrect judgments .",
    "there are more aspects related with this problem but it is clear that one of the main problems when establishing a correct theory of thermo - e.m.f . in bipolar semiconductors is the successive accounting of the non - equilibrium carriers in electric and thermal currents caused by inhomogeneous heating of the semiconductor .",
    "this problem has been partially studied;@xcite however , new ideas have arisen : the modernization in description of recombination processes , the accurate definition of current boundary conditions , calculation of spatial dependencies of fermi quasi - levels , consideration of general expressions for thermo - e.m.f . ,",
    "etc ...    the need of more precise theories and the generalization of some results , considered earlier , have just appeared .",

    "this fact can be of essential importance to increase the figure of merit of thermoelectric devices ( thermo - generators , thermo - refrigerators ) .    in general , electron and hole temperatures do not coincide and are not linear functions of coordinates,@xcite so their temperature distributions should be determined by solving the set of energy balance equations for subsystems of electrons , holes , and phonons with the appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "let us note that the ideas stated in works [ ] and developed in the present work have found an ulterior development in ref .",
    "at present , experimental works@xcite have appeared based in the model presented by us . at present , these first results are the initial based on this theory and allow us to think in optimizing the parameters of thermoelectric devices .",
    "the authors would like to thank conacyt , mxico , for partial support ."
