    "while quantum computers of two bits have been implemented @xcite , as have nuclear - magnetic - resonance ( nmr ) quantum computers of three bits @xcite , extending the number of bits has not proved easy .",
    "we report the implementation of an nmr quantum computer having five bits , involving the use of a linear coupling pattern @xcite , synthesis of a molecule having five usable spin - active nuclei with predominantly linear spin - spin coupling , and the development of radio - frequency ( r.f . )",

    "an @xmath0-bit quantum computer is called on to do three things : 1 ) accept an instruction to prepare a starting state and prepare that state ; 2 ) accept instructions for and implement quantum gates ( from which more general unitary transformations of the state can be composed ) ; and 3 ) measure the state and yield an outcome .",
    "the connection to computation with classical computers depends on the recognition , due to bennett@xcite , that all classical computations can be made reversible .",
    "any terminating reversible computation is a permutation of the inputs , which is unitary , and thus belongs to the class of transformation performable on a quantum computer .",
    "( for issues of possibly nonterminating programs , see @xcite.)=-1    in theory , a variant of the quantum computer is the expectation - value quantum computer ( evqc ) , which in place of an outcome of a measurement yields the expectation value @xcite .",
    "nmr quantum computing was born of the recognition that an evqc can be approximated by use of an nmr spectrometer containing a liquid sample , the molecules of which have @xmath0 atoms with a nuclear spin of 1/2 ( and possibly other atoms , either spinless or having spins not used ) @xcite .",
    "because tumbling of the molecules decouples each molecule from all the others , the sample can be    described by a density matrix for the nuclear spins of the atoms of a single molecule @xcite , with only the spin - degrees of freedom , corresponding to the desired hilbert space of dimension @xmath1 .",
    "nmr spectrometers sense only the traceless part of the density matrix , so in place of matter in a pure state , an nmr computer can use a liquid sample described by a density matrix proportional to a sum of a pure state and any multiple of the unit matrix .",
    "such a density matrix , called a _ pseudopure _ state @xcite , plays a role in the 5-bit quantum computer .    acting as an @xmath0-bit evqc",

    "single - spin gates are implemented by selective r.f .  pulses .",
    "controlled - not gates between nuclei having spin - spin coupling will be described , along with techniques to avoid unwanted influences on other spins .",
    "a key feature of the present design of the nmr quantum computer is the reliance on a chain of linear coupling and the use of swap gates to implement a controlled - not in which a spin @xmath2 controls spin @xmath3 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 have no direct spin - spin coupling @xcite . this allows use in nmr quantum computers of a molecule having a simpler coupling pattern , and eases the problem of unwanted influences on spins .",
    "the proof of the pudding is in the eating : the 5-bit nmr computer to be described was tested on the deutsch - jozsa problem for functions of 4 bits@xcite , in the form described in @xcite , modified for efficiency with nmr as described by jones and mosca @xcite .",
    "( a recent simplification @xcite , unused here , would permit working with functions of 5 bits . )",
    "the problem is to decide whether a function program selected from a set of possible programs computes one kind of function or another . specifically , the problem is to distinguish programs for balanced functions from programs for constant functions , where the functions are from @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "( a function is constant if its value is independent of its argument , and is called balanced if the value for half the arguments is @xmath6 while the value is @xmath7 for the other half . ) the test actually made was to distinguish between programs for one constant and one balanced function , defined as follows : @xmath8 and @xmath9 for all @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , and `` @xmath12 '' is addition modulo 2 .",
    "also , several controlled - not ( cnot ) gates were tested , along with a variety of 1-bit operators .",
    "the balanced function chosen , @xmath13 , has the nice property of being implementable also in classical reversible gates with no work bits .    used to solve this problem ,",
