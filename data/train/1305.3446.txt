    "filter design is one of the most basic and important problems in digital signal processing .",
    "a classical filter design problem imposes constraints on the passband , transition band and stopband fluctuations and the number of filter coefficients . in order to widen the applicability of fir filters it was necessary to devise methods to efficiently impose additional or ingenious constraints .",
    "for example , filters with linear phase constraints are very efficiently implemented using method proposed by mcclellan - parks in @xcite but imposition of additional constraints is not possible .",
    "+   + if the constraints on a filter can be formulated as closed convex sets , where the intersection of the sets is assumed to be non - empty , the pocs methods serve as a very powerful design tool .",
    "after relaxation of certain conditions good results are obtained for non - convex sets too see @xcite . in @xcite pocs methods",
    "have been used for reducing the number of non - zero coefficients .",
    "these methods have been easily and successfully extended to the design of multi - dimensional filters , as demostrated in @xcite .",
    "this further emphasizes the usefulness of the pocs methods .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that _",
    "pocs methods guarantee a feasible solution , not an optimal one . _ +   + this paper surveys the technique of constrained fir filter design using projections onto convex sets with particular emphasis on constraints presented in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a fft based iterative algorithm was proposed , which turned out to be a specific case of the work done in @xcite . +   + we demonstrate how the constraints are formulated for given design problem .",
    "we also provide an implementation of constrained fir filter design using pocs methods . as an extension to the design method stated in @xcite we consider design of a very important class of filters known as the nyquist filters .",
    "the design of nyquist filters introduces certain zero valued coefficients in the impulse response , which makes them computationally more efficient than low pass filters of the same order .",
    "these filters find applications in perfect reconstruction filter banks , interpolator and decimator design and non - uniform sampling , see @xcite .",
    "in particular , the half band filters are used to design the hilbert transformer also , see @xcite .",
    "we begin with a review of the fundamental theorem of pocs and the classical linear phase fir filter problem .    in a hilbert space @xmath0 ,",
    "if we consider a closed convex set @xmath1 , then the projection of an arbitrary vector @xmath2 onto @xmath1 is denoted by @xmath3 and its defined by the minimum distance point in @xmath1 from @xmath4 .",
    "the projection of x on the set c is defined as :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the projector for set c. the fundamental theorem of pocs states that given @xmath7 closed convex sets @xmath8 in a hilbert space @xmath0 , let @xmath9 be the projectors associated with these sets respectively , then the iterative procedure given by    @xmath10    converges weakly to a point in @xmath11 where @xmath11 is defined as @xmath12 .",
    "this theorem , is in general true even for relaxed projectors defined by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the identity operator and @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    for typical filter design problems",
    ", @xmath17 is an appropriate hilbert space .",
    "let @xmath18 , then the inner product is defined as : @xmath19    this inner product induces standard 2-norm on the euclidean space @xmath17 . +",
    "before proceeding further let us define the basic linear phase fir filter design problem that we would be considering in subsequent sections with additional constraints .",
    "+ an fir filter is characterized by its system function given by    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the filter length and @xmath22 filter coefficients . for linear phase , the filter coefficients must satisfy the following condition :    @xmath23    an ideal low pass filter frequency response would require unity magnitude in passband , zero in stopband and a sharp cutoff from passband to stopband . since it is impossible to meet criteria of an ideal filter , in general a filter design problem has the following specifications :    1 .",
    "maximum tolerable passband ripple , denoted by @xmath24 .",
    "2 .   maximum tolerable stopband ripple , denoted by @xmath25 .",
    "passband edge frequency , denoted by @xmath26 .",
    "stopband edge frequency , denoted by @xmath27 .",
    "if @xmath28 and @xmath29 , then the linear phase fir filter design problem can be mathematically formulated as    * @xmath30 $ ] and @xmath31 + for @xmath32 * @xmath33 for @xmath34      first we will discuss the various exisitng convex set formulations for the filter design problem .",
    "it is easy to extend each of them to higher dimensions .",
    "next we discuss several important time and frequency domain constraints , with particular attention to nyquist filters . in order to deal with linear phase fir nyquist filter design , we propose a simple extension of design methodology given in @xcite .",
    "finally , we show results of certain constrained fir filters designed in matlab .    each of the sections would reiterate the importance of the pocs methods in imposing a new constraint on fir filters , assuming that the constraint gives rise to a closed and convex set .",
    "in this section we consider two convex set formulations .",
    "the abo - taleb and fahmy formulation in @xcite was given in 1984 for 2-d filter design and the one discussed in @xcite was put forward in 2000 .    [ [ section ] ]    for completeness , we begin with the formulation presented in @xcite .",
    "the hilbert space under consideration is @xmath17 where @xmath35 for high resolution fourier transform .",

    "the filter length @xmath21 is assumed to be odd . @xmath38 and @xmath39 describe the passband and the stopband requirements respectively with the desired tolerance values @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",

    "+      let @xmath49 , and @xmath50 for @xmath51 .",

    "thus , @xmath38 is convex .",
    "it must be noted that to check for convexity of @xmath57 , the phase along with the magnitude is to be considered . without the phase constraint it is possible to choose two vectors @xmath58 with values of @xmath59 which violate the lower bound on the magnitude , thus violating convexity .",

    "using the fact that for any two complex numbers @xmath69 and @xmath70 , @xmath71 we have :    @xmath72    thus @xmath39 is a convex set . since @xmath39 includes all its limit points it is also closed .",
    "h^*()= |g()| + g ( )    just like in the case of @xmath38 the deduction of the projector is easily done from its geometric representation .",
    "this set , in the frequency domain for all @xmath68 , would represent a circle with radius @xmath25 .",
    "clearly the distance of all the points with magnitude greater than @xmath25 would be minimized from the disk if they are projected onto the boundary .",
    "the other points are left unchanged .",
    "thus , putting together all the sets the linear phase fir filter design algorithm is given by : @xmath73 with arbitrary @xmath74 .",

    "the generalization to other types is straight forward as suggested in @xcite .",
    "the amplitude response of a linear phase fir filter can be given by    @xmath75    where @xmath21 is the filter length , @xmath76 is the discrete set of @xmath77 frequencies in the passband and the stopband , @xmath78 for @xmath79 and @xmath80 are related with the filter coefficients for an odd filter length , @xmath21 by the following relation : @xmath81    for a given desired frequency response @xmath82 our aim is to constrain the error function @xmath83 within certain limit",

    "the algorithm is an intutive one , where , in each iteration the set which violates the constraint set the most is projected onto @xmath116 where , @xmath116 is given by @xmath117 .",
    "a situation where we want for a particular input @xmath118 , the output of a filter to be restricted within certain limits arises in many signal processing applications .",
    "such a constraint is both closed and convex , thus can be implemented using the pocs methods .",
    "mathematically , it can be formulated as follows @xmath119    here @xmath120 denotes the length of the input signal .",

    "we provide here the expression for projection .",

    "for a particular input @xmath118 we might want to constrain the output energy within certain limits . this would be a quadratic constraint , and can be modelled as @xmath135 here again we represent convolution in the martix form i.e. @xmath136 .",
    "this set would be an ellipsoid and thus both closed and convex .",
    "the projector is determined by finding the minimum of the lagrange function @xmath137 given by : @xmath138 where @xmath108 is the lagrange multiplier . equating the derivative of @xmath139 with resect to @xmath140 to zero we get :    @xmath141",

    "the design algorithm is given by : @xmath143 , with arbitrary @xmath144 .",
    "now we explore the problem of controlling both phase and magnitude at specific frequencies .",

    "sets are defined as follow :    @xmath150    the set @xmath151 is non convex ( recall the importance of linear phase constraint in making @xmath38 a convex set ) .",
