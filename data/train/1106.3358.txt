    "this ( @xmath65100kev ) precision was enabled by the small energy spread of the stochastically cooled antiproton beam and the absence of fermi motion and negligible energy loss in the h@xmath66 cluster - jet target .",

    "[ fig : lineshape ] , in the molecular hypothesis , the lineshape of the @xmath1 will be distinctive and will depend on decay mode . for optimal @xmath71 resolution , these measurements will require the use of a hydrogen target : either an improved version of the e835 gas jet or a windowless , frozen - hydrogen target  @xcite ( see below )",

    "given the uncertainties in the cross section and branching ratios , this may well be an under- or overestimate of the @xmath51 formation and observation rates , perhaps by as much as an order of magnitude .",
    "nevertheless , it appears that a new experiment at the antiproton accumulator could obtain the world s largest clean samples of @xmath74 , in perhaps as little as a month of running .",

    "we will also have the opportunity to study the angular distributions of both the known and unknown modes .",
    "the high statistics , event cleanliness , and unique precision available in the @xmath51 formation technique could enable the world s smallest systematics . this experiment could thus provide a definitive test of the nature of the @xmath74 .",

    "the level of mixing ( @xmath771% ) is consistent with the wide range of standard model predictions  @xcite ; however , this does not preclude a significant and potentially detectable contribution from new physics  @xcite . since some new - physics models predict differing effects in the charge-2/3 (  up - type \" ) and 1/3 quark sectors  @xcite , it is important to carry out such studies not only with @xmath78 and @xmath79 hadrons , but with charm mesons as well  the only up - type system for which meson mixing can be measured .",

    "while the total charm - production cross section for @xmath58gev antiprotons incident on proton or nucleon targets is challenging to compute from first principles , recent phenomenological estimates imply values in the 110@xmath56b range  @xcite .",
    "this is sufficiently large that the experiment we propose could amass a sample ten or more times larger than those of the b factories , years before the super - b factories reach comparable sensitivities .",

    "this corresponds to antiprotons of 8gev kinetic energy ( the antiproton source design energy ) impinging on a fixed target and , at @xmath88@xmath89s@xmath90 , represents some @xmath91 events produced per year . since there will also be @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , ...  events , the total charm sample will be yet larger , and with the use of a target nucleus heavier than hydrogen , the charm - production @xmath96-dependence  @xcite should enhance statistics by a further factor of a few .",

    "the low charged multiplicity at these energies  @xcite implies small combinatorial background , so that clean samples can be amassed using only modest vertex cuts , and thus , with high efficiency .",
    "medium - energy @xmath100 or @xmath101 annihilation may thus be the optimal way to study charm mixing , and to search for possible new - physics contributions via the clean signature  @xcite of charm cpv .",
