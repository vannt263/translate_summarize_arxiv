    "in the most venerable scenario for forming planetesimals , dust particles in circumstellar gas disks are imagined to settle vertically into thin sublayers ( `` subdisks '' ) sufficiently dense to undergo gravitational instability ( @xcite ; @xcite ; for a review of this and other ways in which planetesimals may form , see chiang & youdin 2010 , hereafter cy10 ) .",
    "along with this longstanding hope comes a longstanding fear that dust remains lofted up by turbulence . even if we suppose that certain regions of the disk are devoid of magnetized turbulence because they are too poorly ionized to sustain magnetic activity @xcite , the dusty sublayer is susceptible to a kelvin - helmholtz shearing instability ( khi ; * ? ? ?",
    "the khi arises because dust - rich gas at the midplane rotates at a different speed from dust - poor gas at altitude .",
    "the background radial pressure gradient @xmath9 causes dust - free gas at disk radius @xmath10 to rotate at the slightly non - keplerian rate @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the kepler angular frequency , @xmath13 is a dimensionless measure of centrifugal support by pressure , and @xmath14 is the density of gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the numerical evaluation is based on the minimum - mass solar nebula derived by cy10 . unlike dust - free gas , dust - rich gas is loaded by the extra inertia of solids and must rotate at more nearly the full keplerian rate to remain in centrifugal balance .",
    "variations in the dust - to - gas ratio @xmath15 with height @xmath16 result in a vertical shear @xmath17 from which free energy is available to overturn the dust layer .",
    "the shearing rate across a layer of thickness @xmath18 is given to order of magnitude by @xmath19 where @xmath20 at the midplane and @xmath21 at altitude ( for more details see cy10 , or ",
    " [ ssec : wcfe][ssec : initialconditions ] of this paper ) .",
    "for @xmath22 the velocity difference @xmath23 saturates at a speed @xmath24 , well below the gas sound speed @xmath25 . that the flow is highly subsonic motivates what simulation methods we employ in our study .",
    "we might expect the flow to be stabilized if the brunt - visl frequency @xmath26 of buoyant vertical oscillations is much larger than the vertical shearing rate . for the order - of - magnitude evaluation in ( [ eqn : brunt ] ) we approximate the vertical gravitational acceleration @xmath27 as the vertical component of stellar gravity @xmath28 ( no self - gravity ) , and the density gradient @xmath29 .",
    "the last approximation relies in part on the dust density @xmath30 changing over a lengthscale @xmath18 much shorter than the gas scale height .",
    "both @xmath31 and @xmath32 shrink as @xmath1 decreases .",
    ", the vertical shearing and brunt frequencies reach minima set by pressure and temperature gradients in gas ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the limit @xmath33 is not relevant for our study and not captured by either ( [ eqn : verticalshear ] ) or ( [ eqn : brunt ] ) . ]    for two - dimensional , heterogeneous , unmagnetized flow , a necessary but not sufficient condition for instability is given by the richardson number : @xmath34 ( @xcite ; see the textbook by @xcite ) .",
    "the richardson number is simply the square of the ratio of the stabilizing brunt frequency ( [ eqn : brunt ] ) to the destabilizing vertical shearing frequency ( [ eqn : verticalshear ] ) .",
    "the critical value of 1/4 arises formally but can also be derived heuristically by energy arguments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the richardson criterion does not formally apply to our dusty subdisk , which represents a three - dimensional flow : the khi couples vertical motions to azimuthal motions , while the coriolis force couples azimuthal motions to radial motions .",
    "( for how the richardson criterion may not apply to magnetized flows , see @xcite . )",
    "nevertheless we may hope the richardson number is useful as a guide , as previous works have assumed @xcite .    in this spirit",
    "let us use the richardson criterion to estimate the thickness of a marginally kh - unstable dust layer .",

    "* , first full paragraph ) by a factor of @xmath35 .",
    "this is because @xcite evaluate quantities deep inside the layer , within a density cusp at the midplane , whereas we are interested in quantities averaged across the entire layer .",
    "the difference does not change either our conclusions or theirs . ]",
    "@xmath36 since the gas scale height @xmath37 and @xmath38 , equation ( [ eqn : deltaz ] ) indicates that for @xmath39 the marginally unstable dust sublayer is @xmath6@xmath40 times as thin as the gas disk in which it is immersed .",
    "those kh - unstable modes that disrupt the layer should have azimuthal wavelengths  and by extension radial wavelengths , because the kepler shear turns azimuthal modes into radial ones  that are comparable to @xmath18 .",
    "shorter wavelength modes can not overturn the layer , while longer wavelength modes grow too slowly @xcite .",
    "how does disk rotation affect the development of the khi ? in a linear analysis , @xcite highlight the role played by the keplerian shear , characterized by the strain rate @xmath41 in limiting the growth of kh - unstable modes .",
    "the radial shear is implicated because azimuthal motions excited by the khi are converted to radial motions by the coriolis force ; moreover , the non - axisymmetric pattern excited by the khi is wound up , i.e. , stretched azimuthally by the radial shear .",
    "the kepler rate @xmath42 is at least as large as @xmath32 , and can dominate the latter when @xmath1 is small .",
    "this suggests that @xmath0 does not capture all the relevant dynamics ",
    "a concern already clear on formal grounds . in this paper",
    "we address this concern head - on , using fully 3d numerical simulations to assess the role of the richardson number in governing the stability of the dust layer .",
    "three - dimensional shearing box simulations of the khi in dusty subdisks , performed in the limits that dust is perfectly coupled to gas and disk self - gravity is negligible , demonstrate the importance of the kepler shear .",
    "compared to rigidly rotating disks @xcite , radially shearing disks are far more stable @xcite .",
    "the relevance of @xmath0 , or lack thereof , may be assessed by simulating flows with initially spatially constant @xmath0 @xcite , and varying @xmath0 from run to run to see whether dust layers turn over .",
    "* hereafter c08 ) found that when @xmath39 , dust layers for which @xmath43 overturn , while those for which @xmath44 do not .",
    "in retrospect , we might have anticipated this result , that the critical value @xmath2 dividing stable from unstable runs lies near the canonical value of 1/4 , at least for @xmath39 , because in this regime of parameter space all the frequencies of the problem are comparable to each other : latexmath:[$|\\partial v_\\phi/\\partial z| \\sim \\omega_{\\rm brunt } \\sim    @xmath39 and @xmath461 .",
    "but other simulations of c08 also make clear that @xmath0 does not alone determine stability under all circumstances . for @xmath470.4",
    ", @xmath2 was discovered to drop substantially to @xmath60.02 ( see his runs s9s12 ) .",
    "@xcite speculated that the baroclinic nature of the flow may be responsible @xcite , but no details were given .",
    "in addition to being left unexplained , the findings of c08 require verification .",
    "parameter space was too sparsely sampled to discern trends with confidence .",
    "concerns about numerics  e.g . , biases introduced by box sizes that were too small , resolutions too coarse , and runs terminated too early  also linger .",
    "at least one numerical artifact marred the simulations of c08 : the khi manifested first at the `` co - rotation '' radius where the mean azimuthal flow speed was zero ( see his figure 8) .",
    "but in a shearing box , by galilean invariance , there should be no special radius .",
    "it was suspected , but not confirmed , that errors of interpolation associated with the grid - based advection scheme used by c08 artificially suppressed the khi away from co - rotation .    for the problem at hand , the spectral code developed by @xcite and modified by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter b09 ) to treat mixtures of dust and gas is a superior tool to the grid - based zeus code utilized by c08 . working in fourier space rather than configuration space , the simulations of the khi by b09",
    "did not betray the co - rotation artifact mentioned above .",
    "spectral methods , often used to model local ( wkb ) dynamics , are appropriate here because the structures of interest in the subdisk have dimensions tiny compared to the disk radius ( by at least a factor @xmath48 according to equation [ eqn : deltaz ] ) and even the gas scale height . at the same computational expense ,",
    "spectral algorithms typically achieve greater effective spatial resolution than their grid - based counterparts @xcite .",
    "another advantage enjoyed by the b09 code is that it employs the anelastic approximation , which is designed to treat subsonic flows such as ours .",
    "having filtered away sound waves , anelastic codes are free to take timesteps set by how long it takes fluid to advect across a grid cell ( which themselves move at the local orbital velocity in a shearing coordinate system ) . by contrast , codes such as zeus take mincing steps limited by the time for sound waves to cross a grid cell .",
    "the latter constraint is the usual courant condition for numerically solving problems in compressible fluid dynamics .",
    "it was unnecessarily applied by c08 to a practically incompressible flow .",
    "in this paper we bring all the advantages of the spectral , anelastic , shearing box code of b09 to bear on the problems originally addressed by c08 .",
    "we assess numerically the stability of flows characterized by constant richardson number @xmath0 , systematically mapping out the stability boundary in the parameter space of @xmath0 , midplane dust - to - gas ratio @xmath1 , and bulk metallicity @xmath49 ( the height - integrated surface density ratio of dust to gas ) .",
    "though our simulations may still be underresolved , we rule out box size as a major influence on our results .",
    "we offer some new insight into why @xmath0 is not a sufficient predictor of stability . and in the restricted context of our constant @xmath0 flows",
    ", we assess the conditions necessary for the midplane to become dense enough to trigger gravitational instability on a dynamical time .",
    "following c08 and b09 , we continue to work in the limit that dust is perfectly coupled to gas , i.e. , in the limit that particles are small enough that their frictional stopping times @xmath50 in gas can be neglected in comparison to the dynamical time @xmath51 .",
    "the perfect coupling approximation allows us to screen out the streaming instability which relies on a finite stopping time and which is most powerful when particles are marginally coupled , i.e. , when @xmath521 @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that when an order - unity fraction of the disk s solids is in particles having @xmath531 , the streaming instability clumps them strongly and paves the way for gravitational instability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the particle sizes corresponding to @xmath54 depend on the properties of the background gas disk , as well as on the particle s shape and internal density ; under typical assumptions , marginally coupled particles are decimeter to meter - sized .",
    "it remains debatable whether a substantial fraction of a disk s solid mass is in marginally coupled particles at the time of planetesimal formation , as current proposals relying on the streaming instability assume .",
    "particle size and shape distributions are not well constrained by observations ( though see , e.g. , @xcite , who showed that centimeter - wavelength fluxes from a few t tauri stars are consistent with having been emitted by predominantly centimeter - sized particles )",
    ". measuring @xmath55 in disks also requires knowing the gas density , but direct measurements of the gas density at disk midplanes do not exist . marginally coupled particles",
    " sometimes referred to as `` meter - sized boulders''also face the longstanding problem that they drift onto the central star too quickly , within hundreds of years from distances of a few au in a minimum - mass disk .",
    "@xcite claimed to solve this problem by agglomerating all the boulders into ceres - mass planetesimals via the streaming instability before they drifted inward .",
    "their simulation presumed , however , that all of the disk s solids began boulder - sized .",
    "the concern we have is that even if particle - particle sticking could grow boulders ( and sticking is expected to stall at centimeter sizes ; @xcite ; cy10 ) , the disk s solids may not be transformed into boulders all at once .",
    "rather , marginally coupled bodies may initially comprise a minority population on the extreme tail of the particle size distribution .",
    "unless they can transform themselves from a minority to a majority within the radial drift timescale , they would be lost from the nebula by aerodynamic drag .    by focussing on the dynamics of the smallest , most well entrained particles having @xmath56",
    ", our work complements that which relies on the streaming instability .",
    "we would argue further that the well coupled limit is potentially more relevant for planet formation .",
    "if even the smallest particles having sizes @xmath57 cm can undergo gravitational collapse to form kilometer - sized or larger planetesimals , nature will have leapfrogged over the marginally coupled regime , bypassing the complications and uncertainties described above .",
    "particle clumping is not restricted to marginally coupled particles via the streaming instability .",
    "small @xmath55 particles also clump within the interstices of turbulent , high vorticity eddies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ; for a review , see cy10 ) .",
    "this particle concentration mechanism presumes some gas turbulence , which may be present in the marginally kh - unstable state to which dust settles .",
    "our simulations can not capture this phenomenon .",
    "however , on the scales of interest to us , turbulent clumping might only be of minor significance . particles of given @xmath50 are concentrated preferentially by eddies that turn over on the same timescale .",
    "thus the degree of concentration depends sensitively on particle size and the turbulent spectrum . at least in kolmogorov turbulence ,",
    "the smallest eddies concentrate particles most strongly because they have the greatest vorticity .",
    "the smallest eddies at the inner scale of kolmogorov turbulence have sizes @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the molecular kinematic viscosity , and @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the turnover time and velocity of the largest , outer scale eddy . given @xmath62 m / s , @xmath63 , and values of @xmath59 based on the nebular model of cy10 , we estimate that @xmath64 cm .",
    "this is far smaller than the sublayer thicknesses @xmath65 cm considered in this paper .",
    "moreover , the lifetimes of the particle clumps on a given eddy length scale should roughly equal the eddy turnover times , which for the smallest eddies are of order @xmath66 s. we do not expect such rapid fluctuations in particle density , occurring on such small length scales , to affect significantly the evolution of the slower , larger scale khi .",
    "turbulent clumping may only serve as a source of noise on tiny scales .",
    "the possibility that turbulent clumping could still be significant on larger scales is still being investigated @xcite .",
    "the perfect coupling approximation prevents us from studying how particles sediment out of gas into dusty sublayers , but it does not stop us from identifying what kinds of sublayers are dynamically stable to the khi . a subdisk with a given density profile is either dynamically stable or it is not , and we can run the b09 code for many dynamical times ( typically 60 or more ) to decide the answer . in a forthcoming paper",
    "we will combine the b09 code with a settling algorithm that will permit us to study how dust settles from arbitrary initial conditions , freeing us from the assumption that the density profile derives from a constant richardson number .",

    "where a protoplanetary disk is devoid of turbulence intrinsic to gas , dust particles settle toward the midplane , accumulating in a sublayer so thin and so dense that the dust - gas mixture becomes unstable .",
    "if the first instability to manifest is self - gravitational , dust particles are drawn further together , possibly spawning planetesimals .",
    "if instead the layer is first rendered unstable by a kelvin - helmholtz - type shearing instability ( khi ) , the resultant turbulence prevents dust from settling further , pre - empting gravitational collapse . in this paper",
    "we investigated the conditions which trigger the khi , hoping to find a region of parameter space where the khi might be held at bay so that planetesimals can form by self - gravity .",
    "a fundamental assumption underlying our work is that turbulence intrinsic to gas can , in some regions of the disk , be neglected .",
    "there is some consensus that near disk midplanes , in a zone extending from @xmath61 to at least @xmath610 aus from the parent star , gas may be too poorly ionized to sustain magnetohydrodynamic turbulence @xcite . presumably if the magnetorotational instability ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) can not operate at the midplane , disk gas there is laminar  pending the uncertain ability of magnetically active surface layers to stir the disk interior ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or the discovery of a purely hydrodynamic form of turbulence @xcite . to get a sense of how laminar disk gas must be to permit dust sublayers to form , chiang & youdin ( 2010 ) compared the height to which dust particles are stirred in an `` alpha''-turbulent disk to the thickness of the sublayer ( [ eqn : deltaz ] ) .",
    "they estimated that the former is smaller than the latter when the dimensionless turbulent diffusivity @xmath240 for @xmath241 .",
    "to place this requirement in context , @xmath242 values for magnetically active zones are typically quoted to be greater than @xmath6@xmath163 .",
    "whether magnetically dead zones are sufficiently passive for dust to settle into sublayers remains an outstanding question .",
    "that models gas and dust as two perfectly coupled fluids @xcite .",
    "we found that stability is not characterized by a single critical richardson number .",
    "rather the value of @xmath2 distinguishing layers that overturn from those that do not is a nearly linear function of the midplane dust - to - gas ratio @xmath1 ( figure [ fig : m0001 ] ) .",
    "dust - rich sublayers having @xmath243 have @xmath5near the canonical value of 1/4while dust - poor sublayers having @xmath244 ( still orders of magnitude dustier than well - mixed gas and dust at solar abundances ) have @xmath2 as low as 0.009 .",
    "previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) assumed a universal critical richardson number of 1/4 .",
    "this popular assumption seems correct only for dust - rich layers having @xmath1 so large they are on the verge of gravitational instability . for less dusty midplanes , the assumption appears to be incorrect .",
    "our numerical results are roughly consistent with those of @xcite , who also found evidence that @xmath2 decreases with decreasing @xmath1 .",
    "comparing his table 2 with our figure [ fig : m0001 ] shows that his constraints on @xmath2 are , for the most part , compatible with those presented here , for the range @xmath24510 where our respective data overlap .",
    "our findings supersede those of @xcite insofar as we have explored parameter space more finely and systematically , at greater and more uniform resolution , with numerical methods better suited for subsonic flows .",
    "our results turn out to be consistent with the classical richardson criterion  which states only that @xmath246 is necessary , not sufficient , for instability  even though the criterion as derived by @xcite applies only to two - dimensional flows , which our dust layers are not .",
    "our simulations demonstrate that the criterion can still serve as a useful guide for assessing stability in disks having bulk metallicities ranging from subsolar to slightly super - solar values  with the proviso that the actual richardson number dividing kh - stable from kh - unstable flows , while @xmath247 , is generally not equal to 1/4 .    why is nt the richardson criterion for instability sufficient in rotating dust disks ? the criterion considers the competition between the destabilizing vertical shear and the stabilizing influence of buoyancy , which causes fluid parcels to oscillate about their equilibrium positions at the brunt - visl frequency .",
    "however , there exists another stabilizing influence , ignored by the richardson number , provided by the radial kepler shear @xcite . in the limit @xmath248 ,",
    "the brunt frequency ( [ eqn : brunt ] ) becomes negligible relative to the kepler shearing frequency ( [ eqn : keplershear ] ) , suggesting stability now depends on the competition between the destabilizing vertical shear and stabilizing radial kepler shear .",
    "we expect the flow to be stable as long as the kepler shear can wind up unstable eigenmodes to higher radial wavenumbers before their amplitudes grow large enough to trigger nonlinear effects .",
    "this suggests that we replace the richardson number with a `` shearing number , '' defined by analogy as the square of the ratio of the kepler shearing frequency to the vertical shearing frequency : @xmath249 where we have used ( [ eqn : verticalshear ] ) and ( [ eqn : deltaz ] ) . by assuming @xmath250 is constant for marginally stable dust profiles , we arrive at the relation @xmath251 what is surprising is that this trend , although expected to hold only for @xmath3 , appears to hold approximately for all @xmath1 , according to our simulation results in figure [ fig : m0001 ] . for @xmath252",
    ", we would have expected from ( [ eqn : sh ] ) that @xmath2 asymptote to a constant ; but it does not .",
    "our higher resolution runs do suggest the stability curve slightly flattens at @xmath253 , but such deviations seem too small to be fully explained using arguments relying purely on the shearing number .    to explain the observed trend , we might co - opt the methods of @xcite , who linearized and numerically integrated the 3d equations of motion for the dust layer . for their particular choice of background vertical density profile , they solved for the maximum growth factors for the most unstable kh modes ( see also @xcite who considered the axisymmetric problem ) .",
    "we would need to replace their assumed profile with our profiles having spatially constant @xmath0 .",
    "perhaps our numerically determined stability curve @xmath254 corresponds to a locus of fixed maximum growth factor .",
    "gravitational instability occurs on a dynamical time when the dust layer s toomre @xmath255 $ ] reaches unity @xcite . for @xmath256 given by the minimum - mass solar nebula",

    "of course in more massive gas disks ( greater @xmath14 ) , the requirement on @xmath1 is proportionately lower .",

    "taken at face value , such a marginally kh - stable subdisk , embedded in a gas disk having @xmath258 times the mass of the minimum - mass solar nebula , would undergo gravitational instability on the fastest timescale imaginable , the dynamical time . the case that planets form from disks several times more massive than the minimum - mass solar nebula is plausible ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    an alternate way of crossing the toomre threshold is to allow the bulk metallicity @xmath49 to increase above the solar value of 0.015 . extrapolating the boundary of stability in figure [ fig : m0001sm ]",
    "to @xmath229 suggests that metallicities roughly @xmath63 times solar would be required for dynamical gravitational instability in a minimum - mass disk .",
    "there are several proposed ways to achieve supersolar metallicities in some portions of the disk , among them radial pileups @xcite or dissipative gravitational instability ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; see also the introduction of @xcite ) .",
    "none of the ways we have outlined for achieving gravitational instability rely on the streaming instability or turbulent concentration of particles , mechanisms that we have criticized in  [ ssec : versus ] .",
