    "cocr@xmath2o@xmath3 , a member of the spinel oxide family , has received considerable attention in past few years after the discovery of magnetisation reversal of ferroelectric polarisation in this material @xcite .",
    "subsequent studies , in order to explore the multiferroic nature of this system , resulted in illuminating temperature and magnetic field dependent magnetocaloric properties @xcite .",
    "this material has a rich magnetic phase diagram . at a temperature around 93 k",
    ", it exhibits a collinear ferromagnetic ordering followed by a transformation to a complex incommensurate conical spin spiral around 26 k @xcite .",
    "this conical spin spiral further transforms to a commensurate one @xcite , which further undergoes unconventional magneto - structural transitions at high magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the origin of ferroelectric polarisation in this material is believed to be due to the conical spin spiral state and is explained by the inverse dzyaloshinskii - moriya effect @xcite .",
    "cocr@xmath2o@xmath3 crystallises in normal spinel structure in which the co@xmath4 ions occupy the a sites having tetrahedral symmetry and the cr@xmath5 ions occupy the b sites with octahedral symmetry .",
    "the magnetoelectric coupling in this material is attributed to the conical order of the cr@xmath5 sublattice @xcite .",
    "this very well fits into the so called lkdm theory @xcite which , by using a simple heisenberg model , demonstrates that the magnetic exchange interactions among a - b and b - b ions determine the magnetic order in cubic spinels .",
    "however , recent measurements @xcite and first - principles electronic structure calculations @xcite establish that the magnetic structure at the a site and the magnetic exchange interactions among a ions can not be neglected at low temperatures .",
    "therefore , the variations in the occupancies at the a and b sub - lattices can induce significant changes in the magnetic interactions , thus influencing the magnetic order and the associated electric polarisation .",
    "it is , thus , interesting to investigate the effects of substitutions by a third magnetic cation in cocr@xmath2o@xmath3 , as that might affect the magnetic exchange interactions , thereby affecting the stabilities of the spin spiral states leading to interesting functional properties . to this end , recent attempts on fe substitution at the b sublattice have been remarkable .",
    "magnetic measurements on co(cr@xmath6fe@xmath7o@xmath3 @xcite and on co(cr@xmath8fe@xmath9o@xmath3 @xcite show the phenomenon of magnetic compensation and sign reversal of exchange bias @xcite around a critical temperature .",
    "these unusual phenomena vanish when fe content reaches about @xmath10 in the b sublattice .",
    "these effects were attributed to the spin reorientations of the magnetic cations at various sublattices @xcite .",
    "this point was further elucidated by zhang _",
    "et al _ @xcite who upon investigations of the magnetic compensations in cocr@xmath11fe@xmath12o@xmath3 systems inferred that the magnetic compensation can be understood in terms of a role conversion of magnetic contributors and a composition compensation between two competitive magnetic sublattices at @xmath13 , the origin of which is the changes in the sublattice occupancies of the fe@xmath5 ions .",
    "they also found a significant magnetostriction at @xmath14 , which is consistent with the composition and temperature dependent compensation behaviour .",
    "these experimental results demonstrate that the understanding of the competitive roles of the magnetic components at various sublattices is the key to comprehend the fascinating physics exhibited by fe substituted cocr@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "some of us have recently studied @xcite the evolution of magnetic and electronic structures in cocr@xmath2o@xmath3 while going from normal spinel to inverse spinel by fe doping .",
    "however , the structural aspects and their connection to electronic and magnetic structures was not considered in that study . in this communication , we , report density functional theory ( dft ) based calculations on the structural , electronic and magnetic properties of fe doped cocr@xmath2o@xmath3 with a specific focus on doping at different sublattices .",
    "our results throw light on the fundamental aspects of structural deformations , the comparative roles of crystal field and magnetic exchange fields , the electronic correlations , doping at different sublattices and the hybridisations due to fe substitution in cocr@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "these results can help in microscopic understanding of the physical interactions in this system .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : section ii details the methodology used , section iii is dedicated to the results and discussions followed by the conclusions .",
    "cocr@xmath2o@xmath3 crystallises in the spinel structure with space group @xmath15.the structure can be described as an approximately close - packed arrangement of oxygen anions with metal cations distributed amongst the tetrahedral and octahedral sites in a and b sublattices respectively .",
    "the eightfold positions ( 000 : @xmath16 are the tetrahedral sites occupied by the co@xmath4 cations , while the sixteen fold positions @xmath17 are the octahedral sites occupied by the cr@xmath5 cations . the oxygen anion sublattice is arranged in a pseudo - cubic close packed spatial arrangement . a 14 atom unit cell ( 2 formula units ) with @xmath15 symmetry is considered for pristine cocr@xmath2o@xmath3 in the present calculations .",
    "collinear neel configuration is considered as the magnetic structure where all cr spins are parallel to each other but are antiparallel to the co spins.to model fe substituted cocr@xmath2o@xmath3 we have considered a @xmath18 supercell of the 14 atom primitive cell consisting of 112 atoms .",
    "we have investigated the systematic effects of fe doping by first replacing one cr atom and then two cr atoms .",
    "substitution of one cr atom leads to co(cr@xmath19fe@xmath12)@xmath2o@xmath3 with @xmath20 amounting to 6.25 @xmath21 fe content at b sites , while substitution of two cr atoms lead to the case with @xmath22 amounting to 12.5 @xmath21 fe content at b sites .",
    "it is to be noted that these @xmath23 values are close to @xmath24 where the phenomena like magnetic compensation , negative magnetisation and reversible eb effect have been observed @xcite .",
    "the total energies , structural parameters , electronic structure and magnetic properties are calculated by dft+u @xcite method .",
    "inclusion of the effects of strong correlations is a necessity for oxides @xcite and one of the simplest methods is to use dft+u .",
    "also , it was shown @xcite that non - incorporation of correlation effects lead to wrong ground state for cocr@xmath2o@xmath3 . in this work , we have used the dft+u approach adopted by dudarev _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "in this approach , the effect of correlation is addressed through the effective hubbard parameter @xmath25 , where @xmath26 denotes the strength of the coulomb interaction , the so called `` hubbard u '' and @xmath27 is the intra - atomic hund s parameter .",
    "we have used 5 ev for @xmath28 , 3 ev for @xmath29 and 4 ev for @xmath30 .",
    "the value of @xmath27 was taken to be 1 ev for all the elements .",
    "such choices were based upon the available information @xcite .",
    "we have used the projector augmented wave ( paw ) @xcite formalism as implemented in vasp code @xcite .",
    "the exchange - correlation part of the hamiltonian was treated with pbe - gga functional @xcite .",
    "a plane wave cut - off energy of 400 ev was considered for all the cases .",
    "the positions of all atoms were relaxed keeping the volume fixed at the experimental one .",
    "the relaxations were carried out till the forces are less than @xmath31 ev /  .",
    "the electronic self - consistency cycle is iterated till the total energy is converged better than @xmath32 ev .",
    "a @xmath33 @xmath34 centred @xmath35-mesh was used for self - consistency and a @xmath36 mesh was used for calculations of the electronic structure .",
    "the structural distortions in the compounds are assessed by computing angles @xmath37 and @xmath38 , which denote the distortions from perfect tetrahedral and octahedral symmetries respectively , and are defined as , @xmath39 @xmath40 are the ligand - metal - ligand bond angles corresponding to the @xmath41-th bond for the tetrahedral and octahedral symmetries respectively .",
    "the magnetic properties are investigated by computing the total and partial magnetic moments and the magnetic exchange parameters . to determine the magnetic exchange parameters @xmath42 among sub - lattices @xmath43",
    ", we have calculated total energies for different collinear magnetic configurations and mapped them onto a classical heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the unit spin vectors .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath470 ( @xmath480 ) denotes ferromagnetic ( antiferromagnetic ) coupling .",
    "before embarking on the effect of fe doping , the pristine cocr@xmath2o@xmath3 is investigated , in particular the structural aspects .",
    "we have done calculations at the experimental lattice constant of 8.335 @xcite and optimised the internal structure parameter @xmath49 , which corresponds to the oxygen sites .",
    "our calculated value of @xmath49 is 0.261 , which agrees very well with the earlier results @xcite . as was mentioned earlier , the magnetic configuration considered is the collinear neel configuration .",
    "we have considered the cr magnetic moments to be `` spin up '' and the co moments to be `` spin down '' .",
    "our calculations showed both co and cr in high spin states with magnetic moments -2.66 @xmath50 and 2.93 @xmath50 respectively , resulting in a magnetic moment of about 3 @xmath50 per formula unit for the system .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pure ] we show a part of the neighbourhood of the octahedrally coordinated cr and tetrahedrally coordinated co atom . all the relevant angles and bond lengths are also demonstrated . in order to assess the structural distortions in this compound ,",
    "we have estimated the values of angles @xmath37 and @xmath38 in accordance with eqn.([thetatdoh ] ) . while @xmath51 [ the angles vary between @xmath52 and @xmath53 , @xmath54 [ the angles vary between 84.67 and 95.34 ] .",
    "the results suggest that the distortions associated with the tetrahedral sites are negligible .",
    "we have mentioned earlier that the above composition is modelled by replacing one cr atom by an fe atom in the 112 atom cell .",
    "this fe atom can occupy a b site or can occupy an a site . in the later case , it will displace one co atom which will occupy the b site , vacant due to replacement of cr .",
    "this substitution by fe at a site mimics the tendency towards formation of `` inverse '' structure , where in the case of an ab@xmath2o@xmath3 compound , one b atom will occupy the tetrahedral site , pushing the lone a atom to the octahedral site . the case of fe substitution at a site",
    "is particularly interesting as it now provides us with , apart from the substituting impurity at a site , the presence of co atoms at both tetrahedral and octahedral sites .",
    "the resulting effects on the structural distortions , the spin structure of the system and the electronic structure would throw some light on the microscopic physics in the system which would become more relevant at higher fe concentrations where the inversion indeed starts to occur @xcite . in the following sub - sections we report results on both substitution at a site and at b site .",
    "a part of near neighbourhood of the tetrahedrally coordinated @xmath57 atom and octahedrally coordinated @xmath58 atom in pristine @xmath59 is shown . various bond angles and bond lengths",
    "are shown .",
    "the co atoms are shaded blue , the cr atoms pink and the o atoms red . ]",
    "we first report the minimum energy spin configuration for a single fe atom substituting a co at site a. in order to find this , we have considered three different bond distances between co at tetrahedral sites(co@xmath60 ) and co at octahedral sites(co@xmath61 ) .",
    "for each of the three distances , we have calculated total energies of different spin orientations of atoms at a and at b sites to obtain the minimum energy spin configuration .",
    "the results are summarised in table [ tabone : table1 ] .",
    ".[tabone : table1]total energy ( mev ) per fe atom and the spin structure for different bond distances between co at tetrahedral site ( co@xmath60 ) and co at octahedral site ( co@xmath61 ) for fe substitution at a site in cocr@xmath2o@xmath3 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     inclusion of the electron - electron correlation through the coulomb parameter @xmath26 brings in drastic changes in the densities of states and subsequently in the exchange splitting .",
    "a high spin state of the displaced co at b site emerges with a magnetic moment about 3 @xmath50 similar to the value at the original tetrahedral site .",
    "moreover , the direction of the magnetic moment of this displaced co is aligned with the fe moment ( table [ tabone : table1 ] ) , which was anti - aligned in pure gga calculations(fig .",

    "    in figure 5 , we compare the densities of states of the pristine and the fe substituted ( at a site ) cocr@xmath2o@xmath3 along with the atom projected doss .",
    "the results for pristine cocr@xmath2o@xmath3 ( figure 5 ( top ) ) qualitatively agree with previously published one @xcite . upon fe substitution",
    ", one can see significant changes in the densities of states ( figure 5 ( top ) ) .",
    "new peaks at 1 ev above fermi level in the up ( @xmath66 ) band , at 0.45 ev , 0.65 ev , 6.8 ev and 7.4 ev below fermi level in the down ( @xmath67 ) band appear .",
    "the inclusion of electron - electron correlation pushes the co@xmath65 and fe d@xmath62 states , which had formed molecular orbitals for u=0 case to higher energies .",
    "these are the new states appearing in the up band at around 1 ev above fermi level .",
    "this leads to the correct charge states of + 2 and + 3 for co@xmath65 and fe atoms respectively .",
    "the peaks at 6.8 ev and 7.4 ev below fermi level , in the down band , are the contributions mostly from the e@xmath68 and t@xmath69 states of fe respectively .",
    "the peak at -7.4 ev in the down band results from the hybridisation of fe t@xmath69 with co@xmath61 e@xmath68 states via adjoining oxygen 2p states and correspond to fe - o - co@xmath61 superexchange .",
    "the peak at -6.8 ev in the down band , similarly , results from hybridisation of fe t@xmath69 and co@xmath61 t@xmath69 states via oxygen .",
    "the prominent peak at -6.15 ev in the down band results from hybridisations between co@xmath61 e@xmath68 and co@xmath60 t@xmath69 via oxygen 2p states , that is , originating via co@xmath60-o - co@xmath61 superexchange .",
    "the peaks at -0.45 ev and -0.65 ev in the down band arises solely due to co@xmath61 e@xmath68 states arising due to electron - electron correlation .",
    "such re - distribution of states increases the exchange splitting at co@xmath61 site and helps to achieve the high spin state .",
    "a part of near neighbourhood of the octahedrally coordinated @xmath64 atom is shown along with various bond angles and bond lengths for single fe substituted at b site in cocr@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "the co atoms are shaded blue , the fe atoms green , the cr atoms pink and the o atoms red . ]",
    "the fe moments prefer to align anti - parallel to those of cr when fe is substituted at b site .",
    "the total energy of this configuration is lower by an amount of 413 mev per fe atom than the minimum energy configuration in case of fe substitution at a site .",
    "thus , for this concentration of fe substitution , the b site substitution is preferred and the system is a normal spinel .",
    "this is in agreement with the experimental observation@xcite that the inversion starts occurring for @xmath70 . in this case too , all the magnetic components are in high spin states and the individual moments do not change from those in the case of substitution at a site .     atom projected densities of states for a single @xmath64 substituted at b sublattice in cocr@xmath0o@xmath1 . ]    in figure 6 , we show the structural distortions around the fe site and the relevant structural parameters along with the overall deviations from the octahedral symmetry due to fe substitution at the octahedral site .",
    "it is observed that the octahedron around fe expands , the reason being the substitution of cr by an atom of larger size .",
    "the deviation from the octahedral symmetry is almost same as that in case of the pristine compound as is seen by comparing @xmath38 ( @xmath71 for the pristine compound , while @xmath72 for fe impurity site in the doped compound ) in both cases .",
    "the fe - o - co and fe - o - cr angles remain almost at the values of the co - o - cr and cr - o - cr angles in pristine compound .",
    "even the bond lengths change only slightly from those in the cocr@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "thus we do not expect to see changes in the electronic structure as substantial(in comparison with cocr@xmath2o@xmath3 ) as was observed in case of substitution at a site .",
    "the energy level diagram showing the crystal field and exchange splitting of the t@xmath69 and e@xmath68 levels of fe substituted at b site .",
    "the @xmath73 levels are marked purple and the @xmath74 levels are marked green.,width=340 ]    the last row of table [ tab2 ] lists the crystal field splitting and exchange splitting for the substitution at b site ( without including the effect of electron - electron correlation ) . unlike co substitution at b site , substitution by fe enhances the exchange splitting of e@xmath68 and t@xmath69 levels .",
    "this ensures that not more than one electronic state of the substitute is occupied in the minority spin channel .",
    "thus , it appears that the fe spin state is unaffected by the symmetry of the site where it is substituted into . in order to understand the impact on the electronic structure",
    ", we once again take recourse to the energy level diagram for the fe atom in figure 8 .",
    "although the deviations from the @xmath75 symmetry is same as that of the cocr@xmath2o@xmath3 , both the fe t@xmath76 and t@xmath77 levels show splitting .",
    "these split states are shown by broken lines in figure 8 .",
    "these split levels overlap with the adjoining oxygen .",
    "interestingly , the 3-fold and 2-fold degeneracy of the t@xmath69 and e@xmath68 states , respectively , is maintained at b site even after fe substitution . in the distant neighbourhood of fe sites ,",
    "the situations for co atoms at a site and cr atoms at b sites remain quite similar to that of the pristine cocr@xmath2o@xmath3 . in the nearest neighbourhood of fe site , there are 6 octahedrally and 6 tetrahedrally coordinated sites .",
    "both these sites show reduced symmetry due to fe substitution and as a result there is a slight loss of degeneracy in the t@xmath69 states .",
    "figure [ fig : dosb ] shows the doss for a single fe atom substituted at a b site .",
    "it is observed that the inclusion of the electron - electron correlation affects the densities of states of fe , with prominent effects on the t@xmath69 states .",
    "the split t@xmath76 states near the fermi level are now pushed deeper into the conduction band while the e@xmath78 states are unaffected .",
    "similarly the e@xmath79 states at -0.85 ev remain unaffected .",
    "the electron electron correlation pushes the split t@xmath77 bands deeper into the valence band at -7.25 ev .",
    "however , the peaks in the total densities of states are not due to fe alone .",
    "the peak at -7.25 ev in the down band arises out of hybridisation of fe t@xmath69 and co e@xmath68 orbitals through oxygen 2p .",
    "the two peaks at -0.85 ev and -6.5 ev arises out of hybridisations of fe e@xmath68 with co t@xmath69 through oxygen 2p .",
    "the peak at -3.9 ev arises out of hybridisation of fe and cr e@xmath68 orbitals , once again via oxygen p orbitals .",
    "interatomic exchange interactions between fe atoms substituted at b sublattice as a function of fe - fe distance .",
    "the data points have been fitted ( shown as a red line ) with an exponential function as shown in the figure.,width=302 ]    thus , we see that the effects of fe substitution at b site is less dramatic than that at a site .",
    "the impact of local structural distortion is more severe on the electronic structure of fe substituted cocr@xmath2o@xmath3 at a site .",
    "for the case of fe substitution at a site , the two co atoms having different symmetry associated with their sites , bring in additional dimensions to the impact of substitutions .",
    "it is , therefore , expected that the exchange interactions associated with the a site and b sites would be quite different depending upon the site of fe substitution .",
    "this , in turn , would affect the lkdm parameter @xmath49 and subsequently the occurrence of non collinear states",
    ".      in a 112 atom cell , this composition is modelled by replacing two cr atoms by two fe atoms .",
    "the distance between two fe atoms can be 2.78 , 5.1 , 5.89 , 6.83 and 8.33  .",
    "we found that the relative spin orientations of the constituent magnetic atoms change depending upon the fe - fe distance . in fig",
    "[ fig : dis - vs - en ] , the interatomic exchange interactions between fe atoms are shown as a function of fe - fe distance .",
    "these have been obtained from total energies for minimum energy spin configurations .",
    "as seen , all the exchange interactions are antiferromagnetic in nature .",
    "this 90@xmath82 antiferromagnetic superexchange interaction follows from goodenough - kanamori rules .",
    "@xcite also , we have found that the fe atoms prefer to stay far away from each other and that the substituted fe prefer to align the spins anti - parallel to the cr spins .",
    "as expected , the exchange interactions decay exponentially with distance .",
    "this basically indicates that for a low concentration and a homogeneous distribution of fe atoms , one should not expect a prominent contribution of exchange from fe atoms in transition temperatures .",
    "the above discussion is for fe substitution at b sites .",
    "we also checked the possibilities of fe substitution at a sites .",
    "since substitution of both fe atoms at a sites would mean complete inversion , we only looked into the case when one of the two fe atoms are substituted into a sites .",
    "we found that this configuration lies at an energy 185 mev per fe atom higher than the configuration when both fe occupy b sites .",
    "we have earlier reported that for @xmath83 , this difference is more than 400 mev per fe atom .",
    "this result , thus , shows that as fe concentration increases , the tendency for the fe atoms to occupy a sites increases , in agreement with experiments @xcite .",
    "using density functional theory based calculations , we have carried out systematic investigations into the structural and magnetic properties of co(cr@xmath19fe@xmath12)@xmath2o@xmath3 for low values of @xmath23 by successive replacement of cr atoms .",
    "we have investigated the effects of sublattice occupancies and concentrations on the above mentioned properties .",
    "our results show that the substitution of fe at the tetrahedral sites gives rise to co at both tetrahedral and octahedral sites , which behave very differently and produce significant effects on the structural parameters .",
    "the substantial deviation from the tetrahedral symmetry results in loss of degeneracy of the @xmath84 orbitals of fe and co atoms occupying octahedral sites resulting in a lowering of the magnetic exchange splitting of co atoms at octahedral positions .",
    "the inclusion of the electron electron correlation enhances the magnetic exchange splitting , thus affecting the spin states of the transition metal cations .",
    "substitution of fe at the octahedral site , on the other hand , does not produce such interesting effects , and the loss of symmetry of the @xmath84 orbitals as a result of local structural distortion is minimal .",
    "although at very low values of @xmath23 , the substitution of fe at b sites are energetically preferable , a tendency towards `` inversion '' is clearly observed with increasing @xmath23 , in confirmation with experiments .",
    "the magnetic exchange interaction between fe atoms substituted at b sites decays exponentially with fe - fe distance .",
    "the antiferromagnetic exchange interactions among fe atoms along with other magnetic species may give rise to the possibility of frustrated exchange and hence non - collinear magnetic structures .",
    "this should be investigated in detail in future .",

    "<S> cocr@xmath0o@xmath1 has attracted significant attention recently due to several interesting properties such as magnetostriction , magnetoelectricity etc .. more recent experiments on fe substituted cocr@xmath0o@xmath1 observed a variety of novel phenomena such as the magnetic compensation accompanied by the occurrence of exchange bias , which reverses its sign . understanding of such phenomena may lead to control the properties of these material in an efficient way to enhance its potential for multifunctional applications . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we study the microscopic understanding of fe doping in modifying the structural and magnetic properties of cocr@xmath2o@xmath3 with varying composition and substitution of fe at different sublattices by first - principles density functional calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we have analysed in detail the effect of fe substitution on crystal field and exchange splittings , magnetic moments and interatomic exchange parameters . </S>",
    "<S> it is also observed that with increasing concentration of fe impurity , the system has a tendency towards forming an `` inverse spinel '' structure as observed in experiments . </S>",
    "<S> such tendencies are crucial to understand this system as it would lead to modifications in the magnetic exchange interactions associated with sites with different symmetry finally affecting the magnetic structure and the multiferrocity in turn . </S>"
