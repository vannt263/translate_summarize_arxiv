    "the head - on collision of two bodies in general relativity has long been a test - bed for various approaches to solving einstein s equations in dynamical situations , despite its vanishingly small astrophysical probability . because of the axial symmetry of the situation , the problem simplifies dramatically , yet can still retain features of potential astrophysical importance , such as strong curvature , fast motions , and the emission of gravitational radiation to infinity . the first attempt to solve this problem in a fully general relativistic manner was the 1971 calculation of perturbations of the schwarzschild black - hole spacetime caused by a test particle in radial infall from infinity @xcite , using the recently developed zerilli equation for black - hole perturbations @xcite .",
    "the main result of this calculation was a formula for the total gravitational - wave energy emitted , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the mass of the test body , and @xmath2 the mass of the black hole ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "subsequently , these perturbation methods were extended to handle more general test - body orbits around black holes @xcite .",
    "the head - on collision of two black holes has also been the starting point in attempts to solve general relativistic , dynamical problems by purely numerical techniques .",
    "the pioneering computation of the head - on - collision of two equal - mass black holes in the middle 1970s by smarr and eppley @xcite stood for almost 15 years as the state of the art , until recent technical advances together with the use of supercomputers resulted in a substantial improvement in accuracy and reliability @xcite .",
    "generalizing these computations to the case of black holes in circular orbits is sufficiently difficult that it is viewed as a `` grand challenge . ''",
    "another method for studying the interaction of compact objects and the emission of gravitational radiation is the post - newtonian approximation .",
    "although this method can be used for bodies of arbitrary masses in arbitrary orbits , it breaks down when the gravitational fields become strong and the velocities become comparable to the speed of light .",
    "the ultimate goal toward which these calculations are pointed is the solution of the inspiral and coalescence of two compact objects ( black holes or neutron stars ) , and the calculation to high accuracy of the emitted gravitational waveform .",
    "such inspiralling systems are believed to be the most promising sources for detection of gravitational waves by kilometer - scale laser interferometric gravitational observatories ( ligo @xcite in the us , virgo @xcite in europe ) .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that very accurate gravitational - waveform templates will be needed in order to infer characteristics of the sources from the data , using matched filtering techniques @xcite .",
    "it is also widely believed that all three theoretical techniques will play a role in this effort : post - newtonian techniques for describing much of the inspiral phase ( until the system becomes too relativistic ) , numerical techniques for the late inspiral and coalescence , and test - body perturbation techniques for the special case of a small mass inspiralling into a very massive black hole .",
    "consequently , it is important to explore carefully the regions of validity and the accuracy of these techniques , especially in regimes where they overlap .    in this paper",
    "we study the gravitational radiation emitted during the head - on collision of two compact objects .",
    "in particular , we compute the gravitational - wave luminosity as a function of their relative separation .",
    "we use two techniques : ( i ) the post - newtonian approximation , carried to second order [ order @xmath4 beyond the quadrupole approximation ; and ( ii ) the test - body perturbation technique . specializing the post - newtonian method to the case of a test - body falling from infinity toward a massive body , we compare the two approaches . our main findings are these :    \\(1 ) the post - newtonian approximation begins to fail when the bodies are separated by about @xmath5 ( in harmonic coordinates ) , where @xmath2 is the total mass of the system . by failure ,",
    "we mean that post - newtonian corrections to the energy flux become comparable to the leading - order , quadrupole term .",
    "\\(2 ) the post - newtonian approximation converges very slowly : at a separation of @xmath6 , the first and second post - newtonian corrections to the luminosity are respectively 5 and 40 times their expected sizes of @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , relative to the leading - order term .",
    "\\(3 ) the test - body approach shows that for separations larger than @xmath9 ( in schwarzschild coordinates ) , the radiation emitted is dominated by bremsstrahlung radiation generated by the infalling particle .",
    "thereafter , the radiation is dominated by black - hole quasi - normal ringing .",
    "the bremsstrahlung radiation contributes only approximately 3 percent of the total energy emitted .",
    "\\(4 ) at separations greater than about @xmath5 , the perturbation results can actually be well approximated by a hybrid `` quadrupole '' formula for the luminosity , in which the exact schwarzschild test - body equations of motion are used to evaluate the three time derivatives of the source quadrupole moment .",
    "the post - newtonian values differ from the perturbation results by 20% at a separation of @xmath10 , 10% at @xmath11 , and 1% at @xmath12 , reflecting a very slow convergence .",
    "the slow convergence of the post - newtonian approximation has also been noted in the case of circular test - body orbits @xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : section ii discusses the head - on collision of bodies of arbitrary masses to second post - newtonian ( 2pn ) order beyond the quadrupole approximation , including the effects of gravitational - wave tails .",
    "section iii discusses the perturbation approach , and presents the energy flux for test - body radial infall as a function of retarded time , showing both the bremsstrahlung radiation and the dominant quasi - normal ringing radiation . in section",
    "iv we compare the two approaches ; to do so requires a careful mapping between the post - newtonian retarded source variables , expressed in harmonic coordinates , and the retarded schwarzschild coordinates of the perturbation approach .",
    "section v discusses the accuracy of the post - newtonian approach , and derives the hybrid `` quadrupole '' formula for the luminosity . in an appendix",
    "we discuss a remarkable series of cancellations that occur in the post - newtonian method for the radial infall from infinity .",
    "this first subsection summarizes from the literature the relevant equations for gravitational wave generation by a slowly moving system of two arbitrary , non spinning , masses @xcite .",
    "we describe the motion of the two bodies in terms of their relative distance . in a harmonic coordinate system",
    "whose origin is at the center of mass , the relative position vector is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the positions of each body .",
    "if the masses are denoted @xmath16 and @xmath17 , we define the total mass @xmath18 , the reduced mass @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 . also , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where a dot denotes differentiation with respect to time .",
    "the luminosity ( or energy flux ) associated with the gravitational waves can be expressed in terms of the mass and current multipole moments of the radiation field @xcite .",
    "we need only a few terms for an expression accurate through second post - newtonian ( 2pn ) order beyond the leading - order , quadrupole - formula expression : @xmath24 here , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are respectively the symmetric - trace - free ( stf ) mass and current multipole moments of the radiation field , and the antescript denotes the number of derivatives taken with respect to time .",
    "the luminosity is expressed as a function of time @xmath27 , which represents proper time as measured by static observers at large distances .",
    "the total energy radiated , from initial time @xmath28 to final time @xmath29 , is given by @xmath30    the radiative multipole moments in eq .",
    "( [ lumi ] ) can be related to the multipole moments of the source .",

    "we see that eq .",

    "in particular , this expression does much better than its post - newtonian analogue .",
    "this agreement should not be considered to be of deep physical significance ; it is essentially a fluke .",

    "( [ 5.2 ] ) as a tool for determining the large - distance accuracy of the post - newtonian results , as we now explain .",
    "although the numerical curve can not , because of numerical error , be reliably constructed for radii larger than approximately @xmath316 , it is most plausible that the agreement with eq .",
    "( [ 5.2 ] ) would persist at larger values of @xmath218 .",

    "this does not imply , however , that contributions from the pn order corresponding to a shaded region do not appear at all in the time - derivatives of the corresponding stf moment .",
    "if the term in question is a higher - order correction to the moment ( e.g. , @xmath326 or @xmath338 ) , then contributions to @xmath127 of the same order could be generated by correction terms in the equations of motion , applied to derivatives of lower - order terms .",
    "only if the term is a leading - order term ( e.g. , @xmath339 or @xmath340 ) is the contribution at that order identically zero .",
    "it is interesting to note that because of this effect , the coefficient @xmath326 is not explicitly needed in calculating the energy flux to 2pn order .",
    "this coefficient has only recently been calculated  @xcite .    in the case of infall from a finite distance ,",
    "the argument used above fails . to leading order , the velocity is now @xmath341 and the 2pn expansion for @xmath342 contains powers of both @xmath343 and @xmath344 .",
    "for example , terms of the form @xmath345 and @xmath346 appear in the 2pn expansion for the quadrupole moment ; when multiplied by @xmath347 , these terms are not killed by time derivatives .",

    "<S> the gravitational - wave energy flux produced during the head - on infall and collision of two compact objects is calculated using two approaches : ( i ) a post - newtonian method , carried to second post - newtonian order beyond the quadrupole formula , valid for systems of arbitrary masses ; and ( ii ) a black - hole perturbation method , valid for a test - body falling radially toward a black hole . in the test - body case , the methods are compared . </S>",
    "<S> the post - newtonian method is shown to converge to the `` exact '' perturbation result more slowly than expected _ a priori_. a surprisingly good approximation to the energy radiated during the infall phase , as calculated by perturbation theory , is found to be given by a newtonian , or quadrupole , approximation combined with the exact test - body equations of motion in the schwarzschild spacetime . </S>"
