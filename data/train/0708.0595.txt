    "in this work we consider a class of discrete  time dynamical systems on networks , inspired on natural systems of interacting units as for instance the gene regulatory networks .",
    "this class of discrete  time models was first introduced in  @xcite , and in  @xcite their low dimensional representatives were studied in full detail .",
    "these systems can be thought as a discrete  time alternative to systems of piecewise affine differential equations extensively studied in  @xcite , and to finite state models , better known as logical networks , which have been used in  @xcite for instance . in each of these modeling strategies ,",
    "the interacting units have a regular behavior when taken separately , but are capable to generate global complex dynamics when arranged in a complex interaction architecture . in the discrete  time dynamical systems considered here , all interacting units evolve synchronously at discrete time steps , and the level of activity of each one of them varies according a rule involving its neighboring units in the network .    the interaction architecture may allows to reconstruct the dynamics of the whole systems from the observation of a small number of units .",
    "the record of the activity of those units during the evolution contains all the information needed to determine the state of the system at all times .",
    "the aim of the present work is to give a topological characterization of these determining units , in the framework of the discrete  time dynamical systems on networks mentioned above .",
    "this characterization is achieved via a classification of the vertices of the network , according to a determination relation we define below .",
    "the main result states that the vertices in the leading class capture the whole dynamics of the network , i.  e. , if two orbits are such that their restriction to the leading vertices approach to each other , then they asymptotically coincide at each vertex of the network . on one hand , the vertices in the leading class , or dominant vertices as we call them , are sites to record data in order to reconstruct the state of the whole system at each time . on the other hand ,",
    "those vertices can be used as controlling sites .",
    "if one forces the configuration of the system to follow a particular trajectory at those sites , then this forcing will spread through the whole network .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after some preliminary definitions and notations given in the next section , we present in section  [ section - dominance ] the main results , as well as an algorithm determining a set of dominant vertices . in order to get an insight in the relation between the underlying network and the structure of the dominant set of vertices , in section  [ section - thexamples ] we study several families of theoretical examples .",
    "then , in section  [ section - nuexamples ] , we perform a numerical study of the dominant set of vertices in erdos  rnyi and barabsi  albert random networks .",
    "we finish with some concluding remarks and general comments .",
    "[ section - preliminaires ] a discrete  time regulatory network is a discrete  time dynamical dynamical system on a network .",
    "we start with a network @xmath0 , where @xmath1 are the vertices and represent interacting units , and the arrows @xmath2 denote interaction between them . for each @xmath3 , let @xmath4 be the set of vertices influencing @xmath5 , and @xmath6 the set of vertices influenced by @xmath5 .",
    "to each interaction @xmath7 , we associate a partition @xmath8 of @xmath9 $ ] , by a finite number of intervals .",
    "each atom in @xmath8 corresponds to an activation mode for the interaction @xmath7 , so that each atom in @xmath10 is associate to a total activation state on the vertex @xmath3 . for each unit @xmath11",
    ", the activation partitions @xmath12 define a refinement @xmath13 , composed by the intersections @xmath14 with @xmath15 . finally , these refinements give place to the @xmath16dimensional partition @xmath17 .",
    "we will denote @xmath18 to the atom of @xmath19 containing @xmath20 .",
    "the collective activation mode of the network remains constant inside each atom of the partition @xmath19 defined above , and the evolution of the system is given by the iteration of the piecewise affine transformation @xmath21^v\\rightarrow [ 0,1]^v$ ] , such that @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the contraction rate related to speed of degradation of the activity of the units in absence of interaction , and @xmath24^v\\to [ 0,1]^v$ ] is a piecewise constant function representing the regulatory interactions .",
    "the piecewise constant term @xmath24^v\\to [ 0,1]^v$ ] depends on the interaction architecture , and for each @xmath3 is such that @xmath25 where @xmath26^{i(v)}\\to [ 0,1]$ ] , is constant in the atoms of @xmath27   there are associated a sign @xmath28 , and a threshold @xmath29 .",
    "only two activation modes are considered : activation if @xmath30 , and an inhibition in the case @xmath31 .",

    "the discontinuity set @xmath48 of the transformation @xmath37 is composed by the borders of all the rectangles in @xmath19 .",
    "it is a union of @xmath49dimensional hyperplanes perpendicular to the principal axes of the hypercube @xmath9^v$ ] .",
    "we will say that the orbit or controlled trajectory @xmath50 is _ uniformly separated from the discontinuity set _",
    ", if there exists @xmath51 such that @xmath52 .",
    "following the arguments developed in  @xcite , it can be shown that uniform separation from the discontinuity set is a typical situation . for small enough contraction rate ,",
    "it is should be generic ( in the topological sense ) , with respect to the choice of the partitions . in general , by using an appropriate distribution in the set of partitions , the uniform separation could be proved to hold with probability one .",

    "we slightly extend this notion to allow determinations in more that one step .",
    "according to our definition , a dominant set of vertices @xmath43 governs the dynamics of the whole network through a chain @xmath74 of set , so that for each @xmath75 , @xmath76 determines @xmath77 . since @xmath78 , then @xmath58 at the coordinates",
    "@xmath79 can be computed from the values @xmath60 at coordinates @xmath80 .",

    "a similar set of equations is satisfied by @xmath95 . since @xmath84 , and both",

    "this is achieved with a delay which depends on the depth of the dominant set , the contraction rate , and on the particular trajectory . if state of the dominant set is forced to follow a prescribed trajectory",

    "the following is an algorithm we have implemented for the determination of a dominant set of vertices .",
    "here we use the definition in equation  .",

    ", the depth of the dominant set follows a non  monotonic behavior .",
    "[ section - final ] our definition of dominant vertices depends only on the structure of the underlying network , and for orbits ( or forced trajectories ) uniform separated from the discontinuity set , those vertices capture the dynamical state of the whole network . in the general case , for orbits accumulating at the discontinuity set , another definition of domination should be considered . nevertheless , since uniform separation from the discontinuity set is typical , our algorithm determines observation ( or control ) nodes , in all but a negligible proportion of the cases .",
    "one could interpret our main result as the existence of a effective network , smaller than the underlying network , which could be constructed from the dominant set of vertices .",
    "the dynamics on the effective network would be equivalent to the original one .",
    "though such a network reduction can be attempted , specially in the case of @xmath211 ( instantaneous degradation ) , the resulting dynamical system is not necessarily simpler that the original one .",
    "the algorithm we propose is non ",
    "deterministic , and several alternative formulations can be considered . for instance , in the procedure initial - solution one chooses vertices with minimal input degree , amongst those of maximal output degree .",
    "alternatively , one could choose vertices maximizing the output degree , amongst those of minimal input degree .",
    "we have considered this alternative , and we have found that in general it produces larger dominant sets . in spite of this , we expect that this algorithm can be improved , but that was not our aim in this work . instead , we have tested the efficiency of the algorithm on examples where the dominant sets of vertices can be explicitly determined , and we have found optimal or almost optimal results .    finally , the properties of dominant sets of vertices can be used to characterize the complexity of a given network .",
    "we have done this for the erdos  rnyi and for the barabsi ",
    "albert ensembles of random networks .",
    "this topological characterization has to be contrasted with a dynamical one , and this is what we intend to do in a future work ."
