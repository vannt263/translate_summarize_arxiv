    "this implies that multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) spatial multiplexing gains can be obtained even in the presence of a strong line - of - sight  ( los ) component when operating in such high frequencies  @xcite .    in los environments ,",

    "systems designed according to these known criteria degrade gracefully with variations in the geometric parameters , and may be adequate in certain scenarios where the changes in the orientation are limited , such as in a sectored communication cell where the variation of the base station orientation with respect to the direction of propagation is limited",
    ". however , these designs , which utilize two - dimensional antenna arrays , do not provide mimo spatial multiplexing gains for arbitrary array orientations .    in  @xcite ,",
    "the mutual information rates of a predominantly los channel with arbitrary antenna array orientations were studied using simulations and direct measurements in an indoor environment .",
    "the results show that the three - dimensional antenna arrays obtained by placing the antennas on the faces of a tetrahedron or a octahedron provide mutual information rates that are largely invariant to the rotation of antenna arrays in indoor los conditions .",
    "previous studies of three - dimensional antenna arrays for wireless communications have mainly studied the capacity of the resulting mimo system in a rich scattering environment . in",

    "were designed on a cube , respectively , and the performance of the mimo system in terms of capacity and channel eigenvalues in a richly scattering environment were studied .",
    "the objective of  @xcite has been to design a compact array by densely packing the antenna elements while exploiting the degrees of freedom available in an environment that provides abundant multipath components .    to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there has been no prior theoretical study of los mimo channels where the transmit or receive antenna array orientations are arbitrary , as may be experienced in wireless mobile communications .",
    "further , all previous work have focussed on optimizing the mutual information rates of the mimo channel . in order to achieve the information theoretic limits , we need code design criteria based on an error performance analysis of the communication channel . in this paper",
    ", we consider los mimo channels where the number of transmit antennas used for signalling is @xmath0 and both the transmit and receive arrays have random orientations .",
    "we study the impact of the geometry of the antenna arrays on the system error performance and design a los mimo system that guarantees a minimum channel quality and good error performance for arbitrary transmit and receive orientations over a range of inter - terminal distances .",

    "this allows us to derive bounds on pairwise error probability and identify the code parameter that determines the high signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath1 ) error performance of arbitrary coding schemes in los mimo channels .",
    "we show that for any planar , i.e. , @xmath0-dimensional , arrangement of receive antennas ( such as linear , circular and rectangular arrays ) , the rate of decay of error probability is similar to that of a rank  @xmath2 los mimo channel whenever the receiver undergoes random rotations .",
    "further , for some coding schemes , including _ spatial multiplexing _",
    "@xcite , the error rate with any planar receive array decays no faster than @xmath3 even though the channel is purely los and experiences no fading  ( section  [ sec:3 ] ) .",
    "we consider the smallest number of receive antennas @xmath12 that can form a three - dimensional , i.e. , non - planar , arrangement , and derive bounds on error performance when they form a tetrahedral array . in this case , the error probability decays faster than that of a rank  @xmath2 channel and is always exponential in @xmath1 irrespective of the coding scheme used ( section  [ sec:3a ] ) .",
    "we then design a los mimo system with a good error performance for all transmit and receive array orientations over a range of inter - terminal distances by using a tetrahedral receive array and adaptively choosing two transmit antennas from a triangular / pentagonal array at the transmitter ( section  [ sec : system_design ] ) .",
