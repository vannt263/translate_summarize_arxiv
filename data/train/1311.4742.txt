    "given the extreme narrowness of the curvature radiation beam ( @xmath11 for typically expected parameters ) , it is worth to verify if the energy supplied by the goldreich - julian density in such a narrow stream is sufficient to produce the observed flux of the bec .    after introducing some energetics - related definitions in section [ basics ] we estimate the bec s luminosity ( section [ luminosity ] ) . in section [ power ]",

    "] this implies @xmath183 which is larger than @xmath182 by the factor of @xmath217 .",
    "however , the spread of @xmath186-field lines in the colatitude is _ not _ limited to a fraction of @xmath118 , because the extent of the emission region within the plane of the @xmath186-field lines does not smear out the bec .",
    "effects of the colatitude extent are degenerate with the effect of motion of electrons along the @xmath186-field lines and do not ( directly ) smear out the bec .",
    "this can make misleading impression that the colatitudinal extent is not limited at all by the unsmeared shape of the bec .",
    "however , because the emission beam is instantaneously narrow , the parts of the emission region that are far from the line of sight do not contribute to the detectable flux .",
    "this may lead one to think that @xmath183 still needs to be constrained by @xmath218 so that @xmath219 in the stream does not considerably exceed the beam size @xmath118 .",
    "this is not the case , because the emission from the poleward part of the stream ( located closer to the dipole axis ) becomes tangent to the line of sight at a slightly larger @xmath26 ( as a result of the curvature of @xmath186-field lines ) . for an arbitrarily large colatitudinal extent @xmath183 there exists some radial distance @xmath26 , at which the poleward extremes of the stream can become visible to the observer",
    "therefore , the extent @xmath183 can still appear to be unconstrained by the beam size .",
    "however , because of the @xmath26-dependent effects of aberration and retardation ( blaskiewicz , cordes & wasserman 1991 ; kumar & gangadhara 2012 ) , the radial extent that is related to @xmath183 produces a pulse - longitude spread of @xmath220 ( dyks , rudak & harding 2004 ) .",
    "this spread must be a small fraction of the size of the beam : @xmath221 where @xmath222 . for @xmath223 and @xmath224",

    "dipolar field lines are identically inclined to the dipole axis at all points which have the same magnetic colatitude @xmath153 , irrespective of their radial distance @xmath26 .",

    "the apparent bifurcation of the bec does not therefore put equally tight constraints on the stream size in colatitude , as in the azimuth . actually , it is possible to consider streams with elliptical crossection , with the longer axis of the ellipse pointing towards the magnetic pole . because of the curvature of magnetic field lines",
    ", pair production indeed tends to spread the pairs in the @xmath153 direction .",
    "let @xmath241 denotes the range of colatitudes over which @xmath242-pairs associated to a single primary electron were produced .",

    "@xmath241 is comparable to @xmath244 given by eq .  .",

    "we have retained dependence on @xmath145 , because for @xmath260 the stream must be observed at a very small angle ( @xmath261 rad ) so the intrinsic beam is enlarged to the apparent bec .",
    "non - dipolar values of @xmath262 are , therefore , preferred to make the microbeam wider , and to place the stream - cut model in a more comfortable point of the parameter space .",
    "this makes the energy requirements even smaller : for @xmath100 cm , @xmath263 , whereas for @xmath264 cm , @xmath265 .    note that except for @xmath266 , we have been conservative in our estimates , so some parameters may still be set to make the energy requirements even less demanding . for example , the spectrum of the bec ( fig .",

    "thus , it is enough that only one secondary particle ( out of @xmath284 pairs produced per each primary electron ) transfers @xmath285% of its initial energy into the bec .",
    "however , the secondary electron with so high lorentz factor will loose almost all its energy in the form of synchrotron x - rays , not the radio waves . as shown in the appendix ,",
    "the remaining energy of parallel motion is @xmath286 , thus @xmath287 for j1012@xmath05307 . this would have implied @xmath288 , however , such a value of @xmath289 is too low for the curvature spectrum to reach the upper limit @xmath16 of our integration range ( if @xmath290 cm ) .",
    "this means that either the secondaries are accelerated or the curvature radius @xmath145 is much smaller than dipolar .",

    "thus , although no absolute energy limit is exceeded ( there is initially @xmath298 times more energy in the pair plasma than @xmath299 ) , to explain the observed flux of the bec , the available energy would have to be transformed into radio waves at an extreme rate . if the charge - separated ( bunched ) secondaries loose most of their energy in the form of x - rays , some process is required to draw the energy from another source , eg .  from the primaries or the charge - unseparated plasma , which outnumbers the goldreich - julian energy flux by the factor of @xmath40 .",

    "we confirm the need for extremely efficient energy transport into the radio band .",
    "however , gm10 using a similar method estimate @xmath306 , which is in a notable disagreement with our result .",
    "there are several reasons for this difference :    \\1 ) gm10 have overestimated @xmath258 by a factor of 15 , because the duty cycle of j1012@xmath05307 is much larger than @xmath307 , which is the typical duty cycle of normal pulsars assumed in lk05 .",
    "\\2 ) gm10 assume @xmath308 , ie .",
    "for unspecified reason they assume that only @xmath309 of available potential drop can be used up for powering the stream .",
    "we use the maximum lorentz factor that the primary electrons can reach in the radiation - reaction - limited acceleration .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the energy available for radio - emitting @xmath310 pairs may actually be larger than @xmath311 , because when primary electrons are moving up with a fixed lorentz factor ( balanced by the energy losses to the curvature radiation ) , the energy is anyway being produced in the form of curvature photons that can produce the radio - emitting electron - positron plasma .",
    "it is then possible to produce the energy in form of the electron - positron plasma without any change of electron energy ( or even while the electron energy is increasing ) .",
    "for this reason the energy available for the stream may have more to do with the maximum potential drop rather than with the maximum achievable lorentz factor .",
    "\\3 ) gm10 neglect the factor @xmath312 in eq .  , which at the polar cap s rim of j1012 can increase the maximum allowed width of the stream @xmath313 times .",
    "we assume @xmath314 and @xmath315 .",
    "\\4 ) furthermore , gm10 suggest that @xmath28 should be decreased by a factor of @xmath316 because the double - lobed , orthogonally - polarised part of the curvature microbeam comprises only @xmath317 part of the total energy contained in the vacuum curvature beam .",
    "however , the form in which the energy of the parallel mode leaves the stream is not obvious .",
    "5 ) gm10 assume the lorentz factor of radio emitting plasma @xmath318 , the stream size of @xmath319 , and @xmath320 to obtain @xmath321 which is several orders of magnitude lower than @xmath322",
    ". however , their set of parameters ( @xmath318 , @xmath320 ) is self - inconsistent because the bec has the well - resolved double form at @xmath323 ghz , whereas for typical @xmath260 , the value of @xmath318 corresponds to @xmath324 ghz , which is in the range where the bec is unresolved and @xmath196 can considerably exceed @xmath155 . around @xmath155",
    "ghz the flux observed at the minimum between the peaks increases quickly up and it is reasonable to expect that the bec is fully merged at @xmath325 ghz .",
    "thus , the condition @xmath320 may apply only for @xmath326 ghz , whereas at high @xmath17 the stream may well be wider than the microbeam ( @xmath327 ) .",
    "the bec is well - resolved around @xmath155 ghz , and the formula for the beam size used by gm10 ( @xmath328 ) is only valid at @xmath329 .",
    "therefore , both @xmath196 and the beam size ( hence , the value of @xmath330 ) must refer to @xmath323 ghz .",

    "[ nucr ] with @xmath318 and @xmath333 ghz ) .",
    "the value of @xmath145 implicitly present in their beam - size calculation is @xmath334 , where @xmath335 cm is the light cylinder radius .",
    "thus , to justify their pessimistic values of @xmath321 , gm10 assume parameters that imply the curvature radius several times larger than the light cylinder radius .",
    "this should not be practiced to find the _",
    "maximum available _ kinetic luminosity .",
    "\\6 ) gm10 increase @xmath330 to decrease the stream crossection @xmath336 , while keeping the bec s luminosity fixed , which again implies @xmath337 .",
    "one should remember , however , that the beam size also determines the size of the solid angle @xmath18 in eq .   for the bec s luminosity .",
    "for the narrowing split - fan beam , our line of sight must cut it at a smaller angle @xmath117 so that the @xmath338-wide bec is observed .",
    "the value of the solid angle @xmath18 , which is proportional to the beam s width @xmath118 ( or , in the case of gm10 , to @xmath339 ) , should therefore be decreased accordingly .",
    "for @xmath340 the ratio @xmath341 is then proportional to @xmath342 instead of being proportional to @xmath343 .",
    "it is then neccessary to treat eqs .   and as related to the same beam opening angle to avoid the overestimate of @xmath344 .",
    "we have calculated the radio luminosity of a single component selected from an average radio pulsar profile : the bifurcated component of j1012@xmath05307 .",
    "this luminosity , equal to @xmath4 erg / s has been attributed to a narrow stream of radio - emitting plasma .",
    "the width of this stream is limited by the opening angle of the curvature radiation microbeam at @xmath155 ghz , as determined by the well - resolved double - peak form of the bec at this frequency .",
    "it has been shown that the efficiency of converting the stream s energy into the bec s radio luminosity is of the order of @xmath345 , @xmath302 , @xmath346 , when the cross - cap potential drop , maximum energy of primary electrons , or initial energy of pairs is taken as a reference , respectively .",
    "thus , no absolute energy limits are violated , and there is no energy deficit that can definitely be considered ` fatal ' ( as phrased by gm10 ) for the microbeam model of the bec .",
    "however , this result implies that large fraction of initial energy of a single secondary electron ( per one primary ) needs to be transferred to the radio bec .",
    "this is unlikely , because such pairs loose most of their energy in the form of synchrotron x - ray photons . to power the radio emission , therefore",
    ", the energy would have to be drawn from the primary electrons or from the remaining charge - unseparated plasma ( there is an extra energy of @xmath347 unbunched secondary particles per each primary ) . instead of assuming that such processes occur",
    ", it may be more natural to conclude that the bec of 1012@xmath05307 has macroscopic origin .",
    "there are indeed some aspects that make the bec of j1012 different from the rest of double features : 1 ) it is much wider , see fig .",
    "[ size ] , and 2 ) the outer wings of the bec are much less steep than in the double notches of b1929@xmath010 ( see section 3.3 in dr12 ) .    nevertheless , the locally bidirectional emission ( whether of either micro- or macroscopic origin ) remains a valid and successful model for the bec of j1012@xmath05307 .",
    "note that it was not the bec of j1012 , but the absolute depth of double notches , which has decisively supported the model of bidirectional curvature radiation in section 4 of drd10 ( for physical details on the beam see gil , lyubarsky & melikidze 2004 ) .",
    "the curvature microbeam model continues to remain a valid and successful explanation for all the other pulsar double features ( dr12 ) .     of pulsar double features as measured at 1 ghz ( horizontal lines ) .",

    "the orthogonal geometry is supported by the presence of the interpulse separated by half of the rotation period from the mp , as well as by the width of the mp itself ( about @xmath355 ) , which is very close to the opening angle of the surface polar beam ( @xmath19 ) . for small @xmath356 and @xmath120 , which we consider unlikely , both the luminosity of the bec , and the radio efficiency @xmath344 become smaller than quoted above .",
    "this is because the observed width of the bec ( a few times larger than @xmath148 ) corresponds to the intrinsic solid angle @xmath18 that becomes smaller by a factor of @xmath357 .",
    "our results can additionally be affected by the uncertainty in the spectral index , bulk shape of spectral energy distribution ( spectral breaks or cut - offs in the yet - unexplored frequency range ) , distance and scintillation - affected mean flux . however , since most of these factors can bias the result in both directions , it is unlikely that they can considerably decrease the energy requirements .    the value of the polar cap radius @xmath358 that enters eqs .   and is known at best with the accuracy @xmath359% , which is the difference between the vacuum and force free case ( fig .  4 in bai & spitkovsky 2010 )",

    "the bec becomes comparable to the mean flux of total profile near @xmath267 mhz ( 30 mjy , kl01 ) .",
    "the lack of strong bec in the @xmath267 mhz profiles implies that the actual spectrum of the bec at low frequencies is steeper than in the ghz range .",
    "the goldreich julian density in the emission region , which is proportional to @xmath370 can be much smaller than we assume , if the local @xmath371 is orthogonal to @xmath372 .",

    "<S> the bifurcated emission component ( bec ) in the radio profile of the millisecond pulsar j1012@xmath05307 can be interpreted as the signature of the curvature radiation beam polarised orthogonally to the plane of electron trajectory . </S>",
    "<S> since the beam is intrinsically narrow ( @xmath1 ) , the associated emission region must be small for the observed bec to avoid smearing out by spatial convolution . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate whether the energy available in the stream is sufficient to produce such a bright feature in the averaged profile . </S>",
    "<S> the energy considerations become complicated by the angular constraints imposed by the width of the microbeam , and by the specific spectrum of the bec which is found to have the spectral index @xmath2 in comparison to the index of @xmath3 for the total profile . for typical parameters , </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity of the bec is determined to be @xmath4 erg / s , whereas the maximum - possible beam - size - limited power of the stream is @xmath5 erg / s . </S>",
    "<S> this implies the minimum energy - conversion efficiency of @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> . the bec s luminosity does not exceed any absolute limits of energetics , in particular , it is smaller than the power of primary electron and/or secondary plasma stream . </S>",
    "<S> however , the implied efficiency of energy transfer into the radio band is extreme if the coherently emitting charge - separated plasma density is limited to the goldreich - julian value . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the bifurcated shape of the bec has macroscopic origin , however , several uncertainties ( eg .  the dipole inclination and spectral shape ) make this conclusion not firm .    </S>",
