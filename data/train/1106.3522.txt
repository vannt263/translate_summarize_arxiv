    "the latter is indeed closer to the @xmath37 _ loop _ behaviour . a lower balance",
    "is then achieved for this triblock , which means that it is not forced to explore more and more new sets and destroy older ones in order to preserve its mechanical stability . in that sense",
    ", this amount of _ loop _ chains seems to much preserve the triblock integrity , and plays in favour of the future metastable states during the deformation .",
    "this can be related to the more pronounced chevron - type process for this triblock , which compensates the loss of topological constraints due to the low amount of _ crossing _ chains . a this point ,",

    "its magnitude for the @xmath59 glass is higher than the one for the directed @xmath55 glass , because new metastable topological intermediate configurations are more accessible for @xmath59 . despite of the glassy state , and under deformation",

    "it is mainly due to the presence of a rubbery region in triblocks , in which chains can explore more conformations .",

    "this trend seems to be more pronounced than for triblocks , which is again due to the pure glassy state .",
    "during this study , an isotropic , a directed polymer glass and lamellar directed triblock copolymers were generated .",

    ", the evolution of the ratio of created over annihilated events , as well as the distributions of survival events , has been monitored .",
    "it has been shown that these quantities follow the two main parts of the stress - strain curve , namely , the preyield and postyield regimes .",
    "monitoring _ on the fly _ sets of entanglements during the deformation allowed us to also approach the internal metastable cross - link states .",
    "it appears that during the strain - hardening regime , the debonding of the initial mutual entanglement network occurs .",
    "debonding of _ on the fly _ entanglement sets is correlated in time , depending the initial time window from which depart these sets . if one considers sets from the preyield regime , their contributions to the postyield regime decrease with a power - law behavior denoted by a loss exponent @xmath5 . on the other way ,",
    "ones that depart from the postyield regime depict memory effects in the strain - hardening regime . in that case , a power - law behavior is observed , which is characterized by a memory exponent @xmath165 .",
    "the same trends occur for polymer glasses as well as for triblocks .    for triblocks with a non - null amount of _ crossing _ chains ,",
    "the lower the amount is , the longer the memory effect of initial undeformed sets of mutual entanglements is . on the same way ,",
    "_ loop _ chains also enhance long - time correlations and memory effects of internal metastable cross - link states continuously explored upon deformation .",
    "the methodology developed during this study gives rise to further insights .",
    "first , the created and activated sets of mutual entanglements emerge from a complex process , which could contribute to new stable intermediate conformations as well as to participate to destabilization processes and related unstable states",
    ". the inner mechanisms of propagation of these ensemble sets should be more precisely studied , and especially how the large stress drops in fig .",
    "[ stress_strain.fig ] could be interpreted in terms of entanglements and how the amount of _ loop _ chains compensates the loss of topological constraints , as observed in fig.[rate_ap - am_init.fig ] . with the methodology developed in this study , one could access these localized or delocalized ( long - range ) processes",
    ". a quasistatic protocol could be suitable in order to remove the thermally activated processes and distinguish the transmission mechanisms .",
    "furthermore , this methodology allowed us to deal with the problematic of the way external forcing is `` internalized '' by the systems via the cross - link process .",
    "the rheological response of these systems involves permanent cross - linked and uncross - linked sets , which can be described by some surviving probabilities @xmath179 , until @xmath74 times of deformation occur after cross - linking .",
    "these states hold internal stresses . under external forcing",
    ", they are metastable and require far from equilibrium operations in order to be created . in the studied systems , which depict rubbery phase or `` interchain '' connectivities , the generation of internal states as metastable states is closely related to the notion of plasticity .",
    "this notion is itself related , probably among many others , to some time scale competitions that take place during this generation process .",
    "this may lead to an instantaneous momentarily decrease of time scales , leading to a bias in favor of the future metastable state .",
    "then , it would be also interesting to extend the notion of entanglement sets to the study of internal stress dissipation mechanisms and local displacement fields .",
