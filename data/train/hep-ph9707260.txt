    "to study the @xmath5-boson properties in lep2 experiments one needs a generator which can produce 4-fermion final states , since one can observe only these states but not the @xmath5-boson pair directly .",
    "this brings some technical difficulties in the calculation ; there are so many(76 ) 4-fermion processes induced by @xmath7 collisions and the number of feynman diagrams in each process is also big , for instance 144 for the case of @xmath8 even in the tree level . in performing such a large scale computation",
    "it is desirable to have an automatic calculating system .",
    "such a system grace@xcite has been developed for the tree level calculation and utilized to create a generator in the most efficient way@xcite .    including the loop diagrams several works@xcite have shown that the @xmath0 full electroweak corrections to the on - shell @xmath5-pair production become sizeable depending on the physical parameters , such as the mass of top - quark .",
    "then it is interesting to see what is the @xmath0 corrections to the 4-fermion state and to compare them with those of @xmath5-pair .",
    "this is a study also indispensable for a precise data analysis .",
    "till now , unfortunately , there exists _ no _ complete calculation of the corrections except for those from the hard photon emission or from a very limited number of loops@xcite .",
    "the reason hard to carry out the full calculation is clearly a huge number of feynman diagrams involved .",
    "for instance there are about 1,000 diagrams for @xmath9 , and it amounts more than 9,000 for the case of two @xmath7 pairs .    as an intermediate step and also as an exercise toward various 4-fermion processes , we report here the full @xmath0 corrections to @xmath10 .",
    "this is unsatisfactory in regard with the final goal , the 4-fermion case , but certainly goes one step further from the real @xmath5-pair approximation .",
    "|    there are 6 tree diagrams and 287 loops which contribute to the @xmath0 corrections .",
    "feynman diagrams and corresponding matrix elements were generated by the automatic calculation system grace - loop@xcite .",
    "in addition the radiative process @xmath12 with a hard photon(@xmath13 ) has been calculated with grace , which is also necessary to complete the total correction .",
    "we assume the feynman gauge throughout the calculation of the one - loop diagrams .",
    "first we give the result of this work .",
    "some technical aspects will be described later . in the estimation",
    "we have restricted the scattering angle of the final muon to @xmath14 , to avoid a numerical instability which happened in a few loop diagrams .",
    "the unpolarized total cross section with full @xmath0 corrections is then 1.720@xmath150.008 pb at @xmath3gev for the following physical parameters : @xmath16gev , @xmath17gev , @xmath18gev , @xmath19gev and @xmath20gev . here",
    "@xmath21 pb comes from the one - loop diagrams and the soft radiation with the photon energy cut @xmath22 mev , and 1.295 pb from the hard radiation .",
    "the corresponding tree cross section is 1.838 pb . hence the total radiative correction to the lowest order is @xmath23 % .",
    "figure 1(a ) and ( b ) depict the scattering angle distribution of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "angles @xmath26 and @xmath27 are defined from the initial electron .",
    "the histogram represents the distribution of the tree process and the black squares indicate that corrected to @xmath0 .",
    "the deviation seen around the forward muon angle ( backward @xmath28 ) is similar to that for @xmath5-pair , which is due to the hard radiation .",
    "let us compare this result with the case of the real @xmath5-boson pair production , @xmath29 .",
    "this process has 3 tree and 140 one - loop diagrams . with the same set of physical parameters but without any cut on @xmath30 we found the total correction of @xmath6% with the tree cross section of 18.04 pb .",
    "it is interesting that the corrections are sensitive to the top - quark mass , which appears in the quantities relevant to the two - point functions .",
    "this is common to both processes ; for example @xmath31 % ( @xmath32 ) and almost 0%(@xmath5-pair ) for @xmath33 gev and @xmath34 gev .",
    "one can see that the difference between these two processes is not negligible .",
    "several sources could contribute to this .",
    "for @xmath32 there remain 147 diagrams that can not be reduced to the double @xmath5-resonant process .",
    "off - shellness of @xmath35 also gives some portion .",
    "a detailed analysis of the difference is now under investigation .",
    "next we briefly touch the technicality of the calculation , particularly how it was checked .",
    "first of all the system has been successfully applied to several @xmath36 processes to reproduce the known results@xcite .",
    "hence we are convinced that every part of the system works correctly , _",
    "i.e. _ , the amplitude generation , the loop integrations for 3- and 4-point functions , the renormalization constants and the renormalized self - energies .    however , since the process interested here is 2 to 3-body , the following new aspects appear which are absent in any 2 to 2-body process : the multi - dimensional integration in the phase space and an evaluation of 5-point functions .",
    "the 3-body kinematics is already equipped in the library of the automatic system .",
    "the feynman parameters are numerically integrated by a monte carlo method together with the kinematical variables in the phase space@xcite .",
    "we would like to emphasize that this way of integration provides enough accurate results , with an uncertainty of less than 0.1% .",
    "the 5-point function is estimated by a known reduction formula which relates the former to a sum of five 4-point functions@xcite .",
    "we have performed the following checks as the evident self - test of the calculation : ( 1 ) renormalization .",
    "@xmath37 from uv - divergence is kept as a variable in the program .",
    "the result was independent of this variable , as it should be .",
    "( 2 ) infra - red divergence .",
    "this divergence appearing in some loop diagrams is regularized by a fictitious photon mass @xmath38 .",
    "this is also kept in the program and it was checked whether the dependence is compensated by the soft radiation(@xmath39)@xcite .",
    "( 3 ) soft - photon cut independence .",
    "independence of the unphysical soft photon energy cut parameter @xmath40 was observed , which separates the soft radiation(analytic formula ) and the hard one(monte carlo ) .",
    "by using grace - loop , designed to automate the evaluation of the one - loop diagrams in the standard model , a numerical estimation has been carried out , for the first time , to get the full @xmath0 corrections to @xmath41 .",
    "this process is still not a realistic one because the @xmath24 is treated as a real particle .",
    "although our estimation has such a limitation , we found that the total correction shows a deviation from that of @xmath5-pair case .",
    "the difference is not small to be ignored completely , though these two corrections are of course comparable in magnitude . from the view point of the precise measurement it is very interesting and urgent to look how much the corrections are for various 4-fermion final states , such as @xmath9 .",
    "this work has been done as a part of the grace project under the kek - lapp collaboration .",
    "we would like to thank m. kuroda and colleagues at lapp , particularly , drs .",
