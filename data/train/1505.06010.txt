    "these digraphs are called @xmath3cayley digraphs .",
    "the concepts of ( _ directed _ ) _ path _ , _ distance _ , _ minimum path _ and _ diameter _ are the usual ones .",
    "we denote the diameter of @xmath4 by @xmath16 .    fixed @xmath17 , the functions @xmath18 and @xmath19 are defined as @xmath20 and , for non square - free @xmath11",

    "however , @xmath19-optimality also has to be taken into account for non square - free order @xmath11 . in this work",
    "the optimality means @xmath23 table  [ tab : comp ] shows @xmath24 and @xmath25 for several values of non square - free @xmath11 .",

    "an example of this feature is showed in table  [ tab : imp - simb ] .",
    "we check here the first two entries of table  [ tab : imp - simb ] , the other entries of the table can be checked by similar arguments .",
    "replacing @xmath29 to @xmath30 , we get @xmath31 .",

    "taking @xmath34 for odd @xmath35 , there is an mdd of area @xmath36 , @xmath37 , that is tight @xmath38 ( notice the identity @xmath39 ) . taking odd @xmath35 and applying the smith normal form procedure on @xmath40",

    "those tight digraphs that are not procedure  -like extensions of @xmath51 , with order @xmath52 , have been proved to have a finite number of consecutive tight extensions .",
    "this number has been called the extension coefficient and its exact expression has been found in theorem  [ teo : nexp ] .",
    "theorem  [ teo : c ] shows that there are infinite tight digraphs with extensions coefficient as large as wanted .",
    "now some future whishes . a quotient procedure with good metrical properties",
    "is needed when @xmath11 is square - free . in this case , a study of the number of optimal quotients is worth studying .",
