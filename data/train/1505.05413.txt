    "the spectral properties of the magnetic field and plasma fluctuations in the solar wind have been investigated in - situ over several decades , for a broad range of frequencies and for various radial distances .",
    "it was found that the power spectral density ( psd ) of magnetic field fluctuations exhibits three different power law regimes , @xmath3 , characterized by different exponents : ( i ) @xmath4 for smaller @xmath5 ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) , ( ii ) @xmath6 for the intermediate @xmath5 ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) ; this range of @xmath5 is also anisotropic , the fluctuations parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field may exhibit different power law index ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) ( iii ) @xmath7 with a minimum index close to @xmath8 @xcite for the largest @xmath5 ( see , also , @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , for a review ) .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite ) described the three characteristic power law regimes , separated by spectral breaks , as the magnetohydrodynamic equivalents of the scale ranges of the classical hydrodynamic turbulence : ( i ) the driving ( or energy containing ) range , ( ii ) the inertial range , dominated by nonlinear turbulent interactions that transfer the energy over multi - scales and ( iii ) the dissipation range .",
    "the physical processes contributing to dissipation in turbulent collisionless plasmas are still an open issue and in the recent years it has been argued ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) that below the proton scales another turbulent cascade may take place that is described by a different power law .",
    "it is followed by an exponential law which could be indicative of dissipation .    in practice",
    ", the analysis of in - situ time series provides psd as a function of the frequency in the spacecraft reference frame , @xmath9 , that would correspond to doppler shifted wavevector spectra , @xmath10 , under the assumption that the plasma flows over the spacecraft much faster than the characteristic time evolution of the nonlinearly interacting turbulent spatial structures / eddies ( the taylor hypothesis ) . in the solar wind the transition between the driving and the inertial range is in general observed at frequencies between @xmath11 to @xmath12 hz that would correspond to spatial scales related to the solar wind correlation / integral length ( @xmath13 ) or the typical size of the `` energy containing eddies '' @xcite .",
    "the high frequency limit of the inertial range in the solar wind and the transition to kinetic regime is marked by a break in the spacecraft - frame frequency representation , generally in the vicinity of spatial scales ( under the taylor hypothesis ) of the order of the proton inertial length or the proton larmor radius ( e.g.  @xcite ,  @xcite ) .",
    "recently , the variation of this break with the heliocentric distance was discussed by  @xcite , @xcite .",
    "high resolution data seem to suggest that dissipation may effectively start at higher frequencies , corresponding to the electron larmor radius  @xcite .",
    "the solar wind is a supersonic and super - alfvnic tenuous stream of collisionless plasma emerging from the dynamic solar corona therefore discerning `` pure '' turbulence features from other structures convected from the sun is still an issue ( see , for instance , @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "solar wind observations in the inner heliosphere ( between 0.3 and 0.9 au ) suggest that the ordering parameter of turbulent properties is the `` age '' of turbulence , evaluated as the time it takes for the solar wind to travel from the sun to the spacecraft , rather than the radial distance .",
    "the `` aging '' of the solar wind turbulence is also characterized by a progressive spectral dominance of the `` 2d '' mode of turbulence ( characterized mainly by perpendicular wavevectors ) , over the `` slab '' mode ( dominated mainly by parallel wavevectors ) @xcite .",
    "analyses based on a global mean magnetic field estimation concluded that the slow wind exhibits in general features of `` 2d '' turbulence while the turbulence in the fast wind is more of the `` slab '' type @xcite and the anisotropic state found near the sun evolves towards a more isotropic state at 1 au . on the other hand , approaches exploring anisotropy through the scale - dependent local mean magnetic field ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) indicate that the high - speed solar wind power spectrum is dominated by perpendicular `` 2d '' fluctuations .",
    "simulation results  @xcite show the same discrepancy between global and local mean magnetic field approaches and the authors conclude that the global mean magnetic field scaling is not able to properly discriminate between parallel and perpendicular fluctuations .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite ) shows that at high latitudes roughly equal proportions of `` slab '' ( 1d ) and `` 2d '' coexist in the same plasma element .    at solar minimum",
    "the solar wind is characterized by an increased recurrence of the high speed streams ( up to 800 km / s and more ) , lower density and higher temperature , whose origin is the meridional extensions of the polar coronal holes .",
    "the properties of fast and slow wind turbulence were investigated for different phases of the solar cycle , from data recorded by helios @xcite , ace @xcite , ulysses @xcite , cluster and themis @xcite , messenger and wind @xcite .",
    "observations of the solar wind by ulysses at larger radial distances ( between @xmath14 au and @xmath15 au ) , outside the ecliptic and close to the solar minimum show that the spectral index of the fast wind inertial range turbulence takes values in the range @xmath16 for the magnetic field components , and between @xmath17 for the total field , @xmath18 .",
    "the spectra of the slow wind exhibit similar power law behavior but with steeper slopes , @xmath19 for the components of the magnetic field and @xmath20 for the total field @xcite .",
    "it is not clear whether the inertial range spans roughly the same frequency range for the fast and slow wind .",
    "in - situ observations at 1 au indicate that the _ median _ of the magnetic spectral index in the inertial range depends on the type of wind : it is shallower for the fast wind ( @xmath21 km / s ) , @xmath22 , compared to the slow wind , @xmath23 , as shown by @xcite from ten years of ace data ( 1998 - 2008 ) .",
    "the spectral index may take `` extreme '' values , larger than @xmath24 and smaller than @xmath25 .",
    "the steeper spectral slopes are observed at 1 au when the solar wind density is larger , the temperature is smaller , the speed takes smaller values and the number of strong directional discontinuities is reduced @xcite .",
    "close to the high frequency limit of the inertial range , at proton scales , in the vicinity of the fluid / kinetic spectral break , wind ( at @xmath26 au ) and messenger ( at @xmath27 au ) data show that the spectral slope may depend on the power density in the inertial range : steeper slopes are observed for larger power in the inertial subrange @xcite .",
    "this frequency break moves towards smaller frequencies as the radial distance increases @xcite .",
    "we analyze data recorded by venus express ( vex ) in the solar wind , in the vicinity of venus , at 0.72 au , between january 2007 and december 2009 , during the minimum of the solar cycle 24 .",
    "since venus has no intrinsic magnetic field its induced magnetosphere is confined to shorter distances from the planet , thus vex spends in the solar wind more than 20 hours each day of the year",
    ". thus vex is a unique solar wind monitor that investigates the inner heliospheric solar wind on a day to day basis for almost one solar cycle , since 2006 .",
    "the turbulent fluctuations of the solar wind magnetic field considered in this study are provided by venus express magnetometer , vex - mag , @xcite ) with a cadence of 1 hz . the data are obtained through an offline calibration procedure by donwsampling the 32 hz resolution data .",
    "the plasma state ( electron and ion spectra and their moments , e.g. density , temperature , velocity ) is investigated by the analyzer of space plasma and energetic atoms ( aspera , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "aspera operates in the solar wind for short time intervals of the order of one to two hours , close to the orbit apogee .",
    "the ion and electron spectra and their moments are provided with a time resolution of 196 seconds which does not allow a spectral analysis of the solar wind plasma parameters .",
    "nevertheless , the estimation of the moments of the ion velocity distribution function provides the data needed to select high and low speed solar wind .",
    "inspired by previous studies , we select the slow and fast wind intervals based on a threshold speed value equal to @xmath28 km / s .",
    "the magnetic field experiment is operating continuously , however we consider time intervals of roughly four hours length , close to the vex apogee and that include the time periods when aspera is also operating .",
    "additional constraints on the magnetic field data analysis are imposed by several quality checks .",
    "we disregard the time intervals shorter than one hour and that have data gaps whose largest size exceeds 30 consecutive points . in general , the total missing data points amount to less than 3% of the total number of samples for the selected time intervals and they appear to be randomly distributed over time . thus , the number of data gaps in the selected time intervals is small and their length is short .",
    "a linear interpolation is applied prior to the spectral analysis . from a total of 1094 orbits between january 2007 and december 2009 ,",
    "only 204 time intervals fulfill the data quality requirements , of which 48 time intervals correspond to fast solar wind observations ( @xmath21 km / s ) .",
    "the magnetic field components are provided in the venus solar orbital ( vso ) rectangular frame , with the ox axis aligned in the sunward direction and the oz axis perpendicular to the ecliptic plane , in the northward direction .",
    "the psds are computed with a welch algorithm  @xcite of averaging periodograms applied on @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and the total field , @xmath18 for all the selected time intervals .",
    "we also compute the trace of the spectral matrix of the fluctuations . a summary plot of all the power spectra",
    "is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : sumplotbxyz ] ; different colors illustrate different types of wind ( fast / slow ) and different years .",
    "an average spectrum is computed as an ensemble average of all the spectra , for the fast and the slow solar wind , respectively .",
    "the spectral power of fast solar wind is systematically larger than for slow wind as shown by previous results in other locations of the heliosphere ( see the review by  @xcite ,  @xcite and recent results at 0.38 au and 1 au by  @xcite ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the power spectral densities exhibit a power law regime in the frequency range @xmath32 $ ] hz .",
    "a change in the spectral slope is observed around 0.2 - 0.3 hz , close to the local doppler shifted proton gyrofrequency , followed by a frequency range showing a steepening of the spectra that could correspond to the lowest frequencies of the non - mhd kinetic turbulent cascade . in order to minimize the effect of inherent uneven sampling of the frequency range by the periodogram technique , the spectral index / slope has been computed from psds rebinned and averaged over equal logarithmic bins of frequency . in addition to the rebinning of the frequency range we have also searched for the existence of the power law behavior by varying the limits of the fitting frequency range .",
    "thus for each of the power spectra the spectral index ( or slope ) is calculated by a linear least - square fitting over the interval @xmath32 $ ] hz .",
    "this range would correspond to the high - frequency part of the inertial subrange at 0.72 au and solar minimum .",
    "the amount of data intervals is sufficiently large to allow a statistical analysis of the distribution of the spectral indices obtained at solar minimum , between 2007 - 2009 , as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : spectral ] .",
    "the _ a priori _ separation of fast from slow solar wind allows the independent and simultaneous tracking of the evolution of the spectral properties of turbulence for the two types of wind . the least - squares linear fitting of the distributions of the spectral slopes ( upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectral ] ) yields an experimental evidence for the fact that the spectral indices do not exhibit any temporal trends over the years while the solar minimum deepens , both for slow and fast solar wind .",
    "this can be considered an indication that the processes that contribute to the power law scaling are mainly local , possibly related to non - linear interactions leading to turbulent transfer of the energy between scales .",
    "the histograms of the spectral indices show that the slopes of the magnetic field power spectra in the inertial range fit a gaussian distribution , as seen in the lower row of plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectral ] .",
    "the three components of the magnetic field exhibit different average spectral slopes for fast and slow wind : @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and respectively @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the notation for the mean spectral index of the component @xmath40 and fast or slow type of wind .",
    "the mean spectral index of the trace of the spectral matrix ( not shown ) varies from @xmath41 in the fast wind to @xmath42 in the slow wind .",
    "the variation of the spectral index as a function of the solar wind speed is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : velindex ] .",
    "the average spectral indices of the magnetic field become shallower with increasing plasma velocity which is in good agreement with previous work  @xcite .",
    "the continuous trend also seems to indicate that the solar wind velocity may be a controlling parameter for the spectral slope .",
    "nevertheless , recent studies indicate that cross - helicity is equally important in controlling the spectral behavior  @xcite .",
    "the venus express results show similarities with the spectral analysis of wind magnetic field data at 1 au , during roughly the same time interval , between june 2004 and april 2009 .",
    "data from wind showed a mean spectral slope between @xmath43 ( for wind speeds larger than @xmath44",
    "km / s ) to @xmath45 ( for speeds smaller than @xmath46",
    "km / s ) @xcite .",
    "another analysis of solar wind turbulence at 1 au , based on ace data recorded between 1998 - 2008 , suggests a median spectral slope of the magnetic field equal to @xmath47 for speeds larger than @xmath48 km / s and respectively @xmath49 for speeds smaller than @xmath28",
    "km / s @xcite . nevertheless , the venus express data suggest that in average the slope of the slow wind spectra are shallower at 0.72 au than at 1 au , while the fast wind shows in average comparable slopes .",
    "we note the differences between the mean spectral slopes of the three magnetic field components for slow wind conditions and roughly the same mean slope for fast wind . on the other hand more spectral power",
    "is observed for @xmath50 and @xmath51 components in fast wind .",
    "this is in agreement with expectations of finding more power on the perpendicular components than the parallel one as fast wind is more alfvnic and alfvnic fluctuations are mainly perpendicular to the local mean magnetic field and are not compressive . at 0.72",
    "au the parker spiral ( mean field ) for fast ( 700km / s ) solar wind would be around 24@xmath52 , not far from the x direction in the vso reference system .",
    "thus , more power should be expected on the y and z components of the magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "the anisotropy will be the subject of a future study on the same dataset .",
    "we have investigated the spectral behavior of the solar wind magnetic field at 0.72 au , for low solar activity , between 2007 and 2009 , using data provided by venus express .",
    "the power spectral densities of magnetic field components and the trace of the spectral matrix indicate that an inertial range of turbulence can be identified as a power - law behavior , in the fast and slow solar wind .",
    "more power is contained in the fast wind spectra that also exhibit shallower slopes than the slow wind .",
    "the mean value of the slope takes values around @xmath53 for the fast wind and respectively @xmath54 for the slow wind .",
    "our results fully agree with general predictions found in literature about different spectral slopes of magnetic field fluctuations depending on solar wind conditions .",
    "in particular ,  @xcite clearly showed how the spectral index of magnetic field and velocity fluctuations depend on their alfvnicity which can be expressed by the normalized cross - helicity @xmath55 .",
    "these authors , analysing 5 years of wind data , found that as @xmath55 decreases , magnetic energy starts to dominate on kinetic energy and the magnetic field spectrum becomes steeper than velocity spectrum , in line with predictions  @xcite , among others .",
    "the tendency for the magnetic spectrum to dominate over the kinetic one is a natural outcome for a stationary critically balanced mhd turbulence  @xcite generated by non - linear interacting alfvn waves  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "since we study fast and slow wind , which differ in alfvnicity  @xcite , fast wind being more alfvnic than slow wind , we should expect to find magnetic field spectra in fast wind less steep than those in slow wind .",
    "in addition , a comparison with similar data at 1 au suggests that in average the spectra steepen while the slow solar wind is transported between 0.72 and 1 au suggesting that non - linear interactions are at work . on the other hand ,",
    "the fast wind exhibits less clear evidence of the radial steepening .",
    "the solar wind magnetic field spectral indices between 2007 and 2009 have a normal distribution .",
    "we do not find a significant temporal trend of the slopes .",
    "the average spectral slopes of the three magnetic components suggest an anisotropic repartition of power .",
    "a change in the spectral slope is evidenced in the vicinity of the proton cyclotron radius , possibly associated to the transition from the inertial to the kinetic subrange .",
    "our results suggest that at 0.72 au and solar minimum the slow wind exhibits in average a spectral behavior closer to the `` @xmath56 '' law with some differences between the mean slopes of the magnetic field components .",
    "thus there are indications that the turbulence is anisotropic and models based on the isotropy hypothesis , like kolmogorov and/or iroshnickov - kraichnan , are not applicable .",
    "modern theories of anisotropic strong mhd turbulence  @xcite predict that the perpendicular spectrum of turbulence may approach in some conditions the `` @xmath56 '' scaling . in the absence of resolute plasma measurements from vex we can only suggest that the slow wind spectra are perhaps dominated by the perpendicular component .",
    "nevertheless the  younger  turbulence carried by the fast wind is described by shallower spectral slopes that show a tendency to approach asymptotically a `` @xmath57 '' power law .",
    "this could possibly signify that the structure of turbulence exhibits features consistent with models of anisotropic turbulence like in  @xcite (  @xcite ) .",
    "in other words , our results may suggest that the slow wind at 0.72 au and solar minimum is dominated by filament - like structures at the smallest scales ( as suggested by  @xcite ,  @xcite ) , while the fast wind turbulence is dominated by the sheet - like structures , at the smallest scales ( as suggested by  @xcite ,  @xcite ) , possibly related to phenomenological turbulent features of the solar wind at the origin , in the corona .",
