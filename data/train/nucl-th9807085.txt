    "electric ( @xmath1 ) and magnetic ( @xmath2 ) polarizabilities are fundamental observables characterizing the response of the nucleon to an external ( quasi)-static electromagnetic field .",

    "differs from @xmath4 by a so called retardation term @xmath5 :    @xmath6    where    @xmath7    and the ( static ) polarizability , obtained from the low - energy theorems @xcite is    @xmath8    in the previous expressions @xmath9 is the ground state ( nucleon ) and @xmath10 the excited states allowed by the dipole operator    @xmath11    @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the masses of these excited states and the proton respectively , @xmath14 and @xmath15 stand for the charge and position of the ( constituent ) quarks , and @xmath16 is the center of mass coordinate .    a recent analysis of compton scattering experiments @xcite yields    @xmath17    the static polarizability of the proton ( @xmath18 ) is obtained by subtracting the retardation contribution in ( [ alphapexp ] ) , while for the neutron one has access to @xmath19 directly @xcite by means of a neutron - nucleus scattering ( specifically n - pb @xcite ) and the final results read @xcite :    @xmath20    these observables have been calculated in a wide variety of hadronic models , including bag and soliton models , chiral perturbation theory and dispersion relation methods ( see @xcite for a review ) . the non - relativistic constituent quark model seems to present a serious and peculiar problem @xcite : it can not reproduce the spectrum and the experimental values ( [ alphaexp ] ) simultaneously .",
    "this can be straightforwardly illustrated within the harmonic oscillator model @xcite . in this case",
    "the sum over excited states can be performed analytically and one gets :    @xmath21    eq.([alphaho ] ) largely underestimates the proton polarizability under the requirement of a small charge radius as suggested by spectroscopy ( @xmath22 mev ) .",
    "the same conclusion holds within a large class of more realistic potentials @xcite .",
    "moreover , the ( approximate ) charge symmetry exhibited by non - relativistic quark models makes difficult to explain the experimental difference @xmath23 .",
    "it is intuitive to argue that the meson cloud surrounding the core of quarks would substantially contribute to the total polarizability of the nucleon @xcite . as a matter of fact",
    ", it has been shown @xcite that in chiral quark models a large fraction of @xmath4 comes from the coupling of the photon to the charged pion fields , i.e. from the cloud . though the mesonic cloud seems to have little effect on the baryon mass calculation , it is essential to understand many electromagnetic properties of the baryons , the most immediate example being the charge radius of the proton .",
    "recently some quark models have emerged that consider mesonic exchanges in the @xmath0 potential @xcite , as a phenomenological way to include chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "in addition a large debate rose on the need to invoke goldston boson exchange in connection with the notion of constituent quark @xcite , or the possibility of reproducing the observed spectrum within the simple effective ( one ) gluon exchange ( oge ) model @xcite .",
    "the consideration of the meson exchange in the potential relates two different worlds of degrees of freedom : the low - energy nuclear physics degrees of freedom ( mesons and baryons ) and the fundamental description in terms of quarks and gluons . at the moment",
    "there is no clear evidence of a smooth transition between these two worlds @xcite and a study of the effects induced by the @xmath0 meson interaction can shed some light on the problem .",
    "in particular one can rise the question : to which extent can these mesonic degrees of freedom contribute to explain the electromagnetic properties of the baryon , i.e. relegate the missing mesonic cloud to play a marginal role .",
    "the answer to this question would be of some interest to understand if obe - based quark models are in a better shape than oge - based ( or hybrid ) models to describe the electromagnetic structure of baryons .",
    "the electric polarizability is a peculiar observable sensitive , in principle , to both quark and meson degrees of freedom and its study by means of sum rules can represent a useful tool to elucidate the comparative advantages and disadvantages of obe models and oge ( or hybrid ) models .",
    "furthermore , the sum - rule method is sensitive to very basic properties of the models , averaging many fine details of the interaction .",
    "our starting point to calculate the electric static polarizability , including the effects of the meson and gluon @xmath0 interactions , has to be simple enough to have a direct relation with the potential model and , in addition , independent on the space of states introduced by eq.([dipbasic ] ) . in the harmonic oscillator case",
    "the sum over excited states can be directly evaluated but in more realistic scenarios one has to resort to other techniques such as variational methods @xcite or sum rules @xcite .",
    "we make use of a sum rule technique which , washing out all the complications of the baryonic spectrum , requires the knowledge of the nucleon wave function only , and constrains the numerical result to satisfy the stringent inequality @xcite :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the energy gap between the nucleon and the first electric dipole excitation , @xmath26 , and the moments ( sum rules ) of the dipole operator read    @xmath27 |0 \\rangle . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",

    "the non vanishing value of @xmath41 in ( [ simplem1 ] ) is due to the conmutator of the kinetic energy and the dipole operator and no additional contribution comes from the confining and oge potentials which commute with the dipole operator ( [ dipoperator ] )",

    "the isgur - karl ( ik ) model @xcite deserves a specific comment since the inclusion of an unknown potential term to remove the harmonic oscillator degeneracy prevents explicit calculations of the sum rules .",
    "nevertheless , since the unknown potential has a central character and commutes with the dipole operator , it preserves the simple form ( [ simplem1 ] ) for the energy weighted sum rule and the final numerical results are still compatible with those quoted above . a more refined approach to @xmath4 in the case of the ik model , as developed within a variational framework @xcite , also produces results which are consistent with the constrains ( [ cqmestimate ] ) as long as the bounds ( [ alphabounds ] ) are considered .    in the following",
    "we will investigate boson exchange corrections to the simple result ( [ cqmestimate ] ) as generated by the inclusion of pion and sigma exchanges and to this end it is convenient to discuss lower and upper bound separately .",
    "in fact they involve different dynamical effects and ingredients .",
    "for the sake of clarity let us begin the investigation of the lower bound discussing the analogous nuclear limit , which somehow motivates our interest in the mesonic exchanges in the interaction .",
    "when photon - nucleus interactions are considered , it is well known ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) that the first moment of the the dipole strength can be written :    @xmath51    where @xmath52 and @xmath53 represent the number of neutrons and protons respectively and @xmath54 . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ m1nuclear ] ) arises from the kinetic energy conmutator and @xmath55 is an enhancement factor due to the ( isospin  dependent ) n - n interaction arising from boson exchange . considering a ope potential model the values for @xmath55 range from 0.5 to 1 , depending on the importance of the tensor correlations @xcite .",
    "the nuclear example makes clear the modifications to @xmath41 one should expect in the case of nucleon .",
    "an interesting feature , indeed , distinguishes the nucleon from the nuclear wave function : due to the color degree of freedom the spin - isospin wave function for the ( dominant ) @xmath56 symmetric component of the three - quark system , must be symmetric whereas it results antisymmetric in the nuclear case . as a consequence we expect corrections to the energy weighted sum rule ( [ simplem1 ] ) consistent with    @xmath57    where @xmath58 embodies the additional contribution coming from @xmath33 ( cfr .",
    "eq.([vope ] ) ) and constrained by @xmath59 because of the symmetry properties of the quark wave function .",

    "@xcite and its numerical solution @xcite for the wave function one gets , for both proton and neutron , the surprising _ positive _ value @xmath61 which produces a _ reduction _ of the lower bound of ( roughly ) @xmath62 . in spite of the change in the spin - isospin wave function symmetry and contrary to our expectations @xmath58 keeps the sign of the nuclear enhancement factor @xmath55 .",
    "in order to understand this non intuitive result it is very instructive to investigate more closely the corresponding moment @xmath41 in nuclei .",
    "in addition if we want to compare the results obtained in the two systems , the framework must be as consistent as possible .",
    "let us consider , therefore , the n - n potential generated by the @xmath0 interaction we used to calculate the lower bound to @xmath4 , namely the nuclear potential of ref.@xcite : the interaction contains a central part and an isospin dependent term and it provides a good description of phase shifts and deuteron properties . by assuming a simple gaussian wave function for a three nucleon system with a harmonic oscillator parameter @xmath63 @xmath64 ,",
    "the enhancement factor in ( [ m1nuclear ] ) becomes @xmath65 .",
    "the spin - isospin matrix elements contain the expected opposite sign ( with respect to the nucleon case ) as already anticipated , but the spatial integral contributes with an additional opposite sign and both @xmath58 and @xmath55 are positive .",
    "the underlying reason is that the nucleon and the nuclear wave functions are sensitive to very separate regions of the ope potential .",
    "let us look at the ope potential model of ref.@xcite in more detail .",
    "it can be written    @xmath66 \\\\",
    "v^t_{\\mbox { \\scriptsize ope}}(r_{ij } ) & = & \\frac{1}{3 } \\alpha_{ch } \\frac{{\\lambda_{\\mbox { \\tiny csb}}}^2}{{\\lambda_{\\mbox { \\tiny csb}}}^2 - m_\\pi^2 } m_\\pi \\left [ h(m_\\pi r_{ij } ) - \\frac{{\\lambda_{\\mbox { \\tiny csb}}}^3}{m_\\pi^3 } h({\\lambda_{\\mbox { \\tiny csb}}}r_{ij})\\right ] , \\label{vopef2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath67 and @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath49 are the pion , sigma and quark masses respectively , @xmath70 is the chiral coupling constant .",
    "the cut - off parameter @xmath71 controls the size of the pion - quark interaction region .    from eqs .",
    "( [ vopef1]-[vopef2 ] ) and taking into account the rather large value for the cut - off @xmath71 ( 4.2 @xmath72 ) , one can check that for distances @xmath73 fm the regularized part of the interaction dominates .",
    "the nucleon wave function is mostly concentrated within distances @xmath74 fm and is sensitive to the short range ( or regularized ) part , while the nuclear wave function is mainly sensitive to the long range tail of the ope .",
    "this simple argument justifies the change of sign previously emphasized and we can conclude that , despite of the use of the same terminology , the only common feature of the ope in nucleons and in nuclei is its spin - isospin structure .",
    "the spatial structure of the ope interaction looks very different moving from nucleons to nuclei : the quarks in the nucleon are sensitive to the short - range part only , which survives in the chiral limit @xcite but is poorly known , whereas the nucleons in the nuclei are mostly influenced by the long - range tail .",
    "at this point one might wonder whether our conclusion for @xmath58 can be considered as general or it is a particular feature of the employed model . to check this point , and taking advantage of the flexibility of the sum - rule techniques , we have repeated the calculation of @xmath58 for other interquark potential models , namely , the hybrid model proposed by dziembowski , fabre de la ripelle and miller in ref.@xcite and the version of the obe model due to glozman , papp , plessas , varga and wagengrunn presented in @xcite . for those potentials we used a simple coulombian - type ( @xmath75 ) approximation for the wave functions",
    "whose size parameter is fixed to reproduce the proton root - mean - square radius predicted by those potential models .",
    "the sum rule value of @xmath42 is fixed by the size of the nucleon and therefore is well reproduced also within such approximate procedure .",
    "the other ingredient of the lower bound , namely @xmath41 , is quite insensitive to the details of the wave function behavior once the size of the system is reproduced@xcite .",
    "for example , for the potential of valcarce _ et al .",
    "_ the coulombian approximation of the wave function gives @xmath76 against @xmath61 of the calculation with the full wave function .",
    "our results for @xmath58 are summarized in table i , where we can see that in spite of the differences in the absolutes values ( due essentially to the different strength @xmath70 and cut - off @xmath77 parameters ) the sign of @xmath58 is always positive .",
    "therefore our previous conclusions are quite general and rely on the common short range behavior of the interquark potentials , as it is confirmed in fig .",
    "1 where they are compared in the region @xmath78 fm . in fact",
    "these similarities are a direct consequences of the rather large values of @xmath77 employed in the models . in conclusion ,",
    "the introduction of meson exchange contributions lead to a smaller value of the lower bound and their inclusion does not represent any improvement .",
    "the discussion of the previous section leads to the conclusion that the lower bound to the nucleon polarizability is rather small even including meson exchange effects in the @xmath0 potential .",
    "does such conclusion mean that the range of the allowed values for @xmath4 is simply enlarged by the presence of virtual mesons ? the question opens the need for a reinvestigation of the upper bound .",
    "in fact it is evident from eq .",
    "( [ alphabounds ] ) that a shift in the allowed values of @xmath4 is achieved more easily by increasing @xmath42 rather than by lowering @xmath41 . in addition one can note that @xmath42 is extremely transparent : it depends on the definition of the dipole operator ( and the nucleon ground state ) only .",
    "the expression for @xmath79 used in the previous section was obtained by assuming a non - relativistic charge density :    @xmath80    the dipole operator being defined as :    @xmath81    corrections to the charge density @xcite will translate into modifications to the dipole operator , i.e. , to @xmath42 .",
    "however there are modifications of the charge density which leave the dipole operator unchanged .    as an example",
    "let us consider the rather common inclusion of a photon - quark form factor which is supposed to take into account the structure of the constituent quarks :    @xmath82    the replacement ( [ qgammaff ] ) increases the charge radius @xcite of the baryon but has no effect on the dipole operator .",
    "the same conclusion holds for any relativistic correction to ( [ rhonr ] ) , such as the darwin - foldy term , which does not modify the spherical symmetry of the quark charge distribution .    a trivial solution , sometimes invoked , would be the introduction of _ ad hoc _ intrinsic polarizabilities of the quark ( or equivalently , intrinsic dipole form factors , analogous to ( [ qgammaff ] ) ) , but the predictive power of the model is lost unless it is extended to the study of other observables ( for example generalized polarizabilities in virtual compton scattering ) .",
    "a more ambitious approach , beyond the scope of the present work , would be to explain how this intrinsic polarizabilities ( or intrinsic form factors ) are built from more fundamental physical mechanisms , such as pion loop fluctuations ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "since we are interested in those mesonic effects directly related to the spectral hamiltonian we will investigate in detail a source of corrections to the charge density ( and consequently to the dipole operator of eq.([dzgendef ] ) ) which is directly related to the form of the potentials we are studying : the two - body exchange terms which appear as a consequence of current conservation when isospin or velocity dependent interactions are included .",
    "the @xmath0 potentials considered in the present investigation contain , in fact , terms of this kind : the ope interaction ( [ vope ] ) .",
    "in addition to the pion exchange current required by current conservation    @xmath83\\,\\,,\\ ] ]    a two - body charge density @xmath84 can be associated ( see @xcite and references therein ) and the corresponding modification to the dipole operator considered . let us emphasize that , in fact , the pion exchange current contributions ( [ pioncurrent ] ) have been already included in the calculation of the energy weighted sum rule @xmath41 of eq.([trknuc ] ) .",
    "they are embodied in the additional term @xmath58 which does not vanishes precisely because the conmutator ( [ pioncurrent ] ) is different from zero .",
    "selfconsistency would , therefore , require to consider also the additional mentioned two - body densities in @xmath42 .",
    "the order by order procedure can stop here ( as to the first order pion terms ) and we do not need to reconsider two - body densities contribution to @xmath41 .",
    "let us explicitly show the corrections to the dipole operator coming from the pion exchange interaction ( [ vopef1 ] ) .",
    "one has    @xmath85 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\left ( g(m_\\pi r_{ij } ) - \\frac{{\\lambda_{\\mbox { \\tiny csb}}}^2}{m_\\pi^2 } g({\\lambda_{\\mbox { \\tiny csb}}}r_{ij } ) \\right ) \\ ; , \\label{dope}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath86    from the numerical point of view the pion contribution in the model of valcarce _ et al . _",
    "_ lowers _ the non - energy weighted sum rule from @xmath87 @xmath46 to @xmath88 @xmath46 for the proton and @xmath89 @xmath46 for the neutron ( the neutron - proton difference originates not only from the @xmath56-breaking components in the nucleon wave function , but also from the structure of the operator ( [ dope ] ) which is sensitive to the total isospin of the system even in the @xmath56-symmetric limit ) .",
    "the modifications in @xmath42 renormalize slightly both upper and lower bounds to the polarizability which becomes    @xmath90    a similar trend is observed for other potentials ( see table ii ) .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath91 has a small effect on @xmath92 and in general it reduces the initial one body contribution . as a result the upper bounds to @xmath93 with the other two potentials shown in table ii are @xmath94 @xmath95 for dziembowsky _ et al . _ and @xmath96 @xmath95 for glozman _ et al . _    a comparison with eq.([simplem0 ]",
    ") shows that the present results for @xmath92 are consistent with a shrinking of the size of the nucleon by ope , an effect already discussed by the authors of refs . @xcite .",
    "two - body mesonic currents have been proved to be crucial to explain some observables such as @xmath97 electric multipoles and neutron charge radius @xcite . however in these cases the leading one - body contribution is strongly suppressed by symmetry reasons .",
    "the argument is not valid in general and can not be invoked for the electric polarizability ( neither for the charge radius of the proton ) where these two - body currents are not sufficient to parameterize all the non - valence degrees of freedom seen by electromagnetic probes .",
    "nevertheless before drawing more definite conclusions on the effects of meson exchange on the nucleon electric polarizability , it is worth mentioning that two - body charge density modifications come also from the other terms of the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "their origin is a little more subtle than the pion contributions and has to do basically with the relativistic corrections to the one - body charge density of eq.([rhonr ] ) . as a result",
    "the charge density can be written as a sum of a non - relativistic contribution plus the ones coming from ope , ose , oge and confinement potential ; namely @xmath98 on the same basis the dipole operator acquires the corresponding components : @xmath99    since we want to focus on mesonic contributions , we will not consider here the oge and confinement component , and the only additional component we will calculate explicitly is the one coming form the the ose potential term , obtaining    @xmath100 \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the detailed contributions to @xmath42 from the different terms of the dipole operator @xmath101 are summarized in table iii .",
    "the full result , sum of all the entries in the table ii , is @xmath102 @xmath46 for the proton and @xmath103 @xmath46 for the neutron , values slightly larger than the corresponding results ( [ opebounds ] ) obtained including ope only , but still smaller than non - relativistic impulse approximation obtained considering the one - body contribution @xmath104 only .",
    "therefore , the final bounds on the polarizability remain :    @xmath105    a final comment on the terms neglected in ( [ dzdecomposition ] ) is in order .",
    "previous analysis of the contribution of @xmath106 to the nucleon electric form factors show a quite large sensitivity to the potential model : in @xcite the confinement two - body charge produces a reduction of the charge radius of the proton whereas in @xcite an increment is found .",
    "furthermore , there is some sensitivity to the details of the employed wave function ( see @xcite for a comparison ) . while the @xmath107 term is present in both obe - based and hybrid models , in the latter we can find an additional two - body density @xmath108 that gives a positive contribution to the size of the proton @xcite .",
    "one can estimate that this increment of the square charge radius of the proton , that in our reference model is of 0.063 @xmath46 , would presumably induce an increment ( through @xmath92 ) of the allowed values for @xmath93 of , roughly , @xmath109 @xmath95 .",
    "nonetheless , in some models @xcite such a large effect on the size of the nucleon is strongly suppressed by the confinement two - body current .",
    "since the emphasis of our work is on meson exchange effects we will not discuss this effects further .",
    "additional relativistic corrections to the current could certainly be considered @xcite , and they would also receive contributions from pion and sigma exchange . in ref .",
    "@xcite the effects of relativistic corrections to @xmath110 were calculated ( up to order @xmath111 ) and found to be small ( @xmath112 % ) and also reduced the value of @xmath4 . on the same grounds , potential dependent corrections to the static polarizability",
    "have been proposed @xcite and discussed @xcite .",
    "however we believe that the comparison between ( [ finalbounds ] ) and ( [ cqmestimate ] ) gives a good idea of the importance of the meson exchange for the nucleon polarizability .",
    "in addition the validity of our conclusions are largely independent on the details of @xmath0 interaction model and rely on their basic features .",
    "in particular the aspects which play a relevant role for the present investigation are the small core size for the nucleon wave function ( which basically determines @xmath92 ) and the sign and short - range behavior of the mesonic interaction ( that enters in @xmath113 ) , largely constrained by the @xmath97 splitting in the spectrum .",
    "we have shown that the nucleon polarizability is quite a transparent observable to elucidate the rle ( or better , the lack of rle ) of meson - exchange effects between quarks in a non - relativistic approach .",
    "the robustness of the employed method , the sum rule technique , resides on the fact that the sum over infinite excitations is avoided and transformed into conmutators that depend on very basic features of the @xmath0 interaction , so that it is possible to compare , in a simple and direct way , a large class of @xmath0 potential models .",
    "it has been shown that , unlike in nuclei , meson exchange currents are not relevant to explain experimental evidences .",
    "the comparison between the nuclear and the nucleon case reflects the rather different scales involved in the problem . while the former is sensitive to the long - distance tail of the ope potential the last is mostly affected by the regularized short - range part .",
    "a different choice of the ope interaction does not change substantially the behavior of @xmath58 in section iii .",
    "this is basically a consequence of the constraints that hadronic spectroscopy ( and in particular the @xmath97 splittings ) imposes on the short - range behavior of the pseudoscalar potential .",
    "furthermore , the small size of the nucleon seems to be also a common requirement of the baryonic spectroscopy .",
    "another type of corrections to the polarizability are due to the two - body charge density generated by meson exchanges ( @xmath114 and @xmath115 considered here in more detail ) .",
    "their contribution tends to reduce the allowed values of @xmath4 .",
    "the same trend is observed in other calculations for the charge radius of the proton @xcite .",
    "these facts are pointing out the limitations of mesonic two - body terms to parameterize the effects of non - valence degrees of freedom in the nucleon .",
    "the gluonic two - body current present in oge - based and hybrid model might contribute to some extent to increase the allowed values for the polarizability .",
    "the picture of the nucleon as a core plus a meson cloud , that emerges not only from constituent quark models but also from nambu  jona - lasinio and skirmion models @xcite , have no analogy in nuclei .",
    "meson exchange currents , or equivalently the ope and ose terms , still leave much room to the cloud in the description of the electromagnetic properties of the nucleon .",
    "the inclusion of the internal polarizability of pions and/or more refined treatment of the @xmath116 component in the wave function seems to be unavoidable and it should be further investigated .",
    "in other language , it means that the efforts in the description of the electromagnetic baryonic transitions should be concentrated on the construction of the effective photon - quark ( and/or photon - quark - antiquark , etc ) operator since the hadronic wave functions can not account for all the physical ingredients required to explain the electromagnetic structure of the baryons .",
    "this conclusion is reinforced by some calculations of other electromagnetic observables , for which the use of hadronic wave functions based on obe potentials @xcite does not represent much improvement with respect to the calculations based on oge interactions @xcite .",
