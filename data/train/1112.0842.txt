    "the rhic beam energy scan ( bes ) is mainly focused on a search for the qcd critical point and the 1st - order phase boundary in the qcd phase diagram . in the year 2010",
    ", the star experiment at rhic took data for the beam energies @xmath37.7 , 11.5 and 39 gev as a first phase of the bes program .",
    "analysis of the collected data for various observables sensitive to the phase transition and critical point continues for the successful accomplishment of the program .",
    "directed flow , @xmath0 , is the first harmonic coefficient in the azimuthal distribution of the particles with respect to the reaction plane , @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the azimuthal angle of an outgoing particle and @xmath6 is the orientation of the reaction plane defined by the beam axis and the impact parameter vector@xcite . both hydrodynamic and nuclear transport models  @xcite indicate that directed flow is a sensitive signature for the phenomena related to the possible phase transition specially in the bes region  @xcite . in particular , the shape of @xmath7 may exhibit flatness at midrapidity due to a strong , tilted expansion of the source giving rise to anti - flow or a 3rd flow  @xcite component .",
    "if the tilted expansion is strong enough , it can cancel and reverse the motion in the bounce - off direction and results in a negative @xmath8 slope at midrapidity , potentially producing a wiggle like structure in @xmath7 .",
    "a wiggle for baryons is a possible signature of a phase transition between hadronic matter and quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , although qgp is not the only possible explanation  @xcite .",
    "if strong but incomplete baryon stopping is assumed together with positive space - momentum correlations caused by transverse radial expansion , then a wiggle structure might be explained even in a hadronic system  @xcite .",

    "the right panel shows charged hadron @xmath12 as a function of @xmath9 - @xmath10 .",

    "data were taken from run 10 ( 2010 ) .",
    "the star time projection chamber ( tpc ) @xcite was used as the main detector for charged particle tracking at midrapidity and forward time projection chambers ( ftpcs ) were used for charged particle tracking at forward rapidities .",
    "the centrality was determined by the number of tracks from the pseudorapidity region @xmath16 .",
    "two beam beam counters covering @xmath17 were used to reconstruct the first order event plane for this analysis .",
    "the pseudorapidity gap between bbc and tpc suppresses the the non - flow effects .",
    "we analyzed minimum bias events with the following conditions : event vertex radius ( @xmath18 cm , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the vertex positions along the @xmath21 and @xmath22 directions , respectively , and @xmath23 within 70 , 50 and 30 cm of the center of the detector at 7.7 , 11.5 and 39 gev respectively .",
    "tracks are also required to have transverse momenta @xmath24 gev@xmath25 , pass within 3 cm of the primary vertex , have at least 15 space points in the main tpc acceptance @xmath26 or 5 space points in the case of tracks in the ftpc acceptance ( @xmath27 ) , and we require the ratio of the number of actual space points to the maximum possible number of space points to be greater than 0.52 . protons and antiprotons up to 2.8 gev/@xmath28 and @xmath1 and @xmath2 up to 1.6 gev/@xmath28 in transverse momentum were identified based on specific energy loss in the tpc and the time - of - flight information from multi - gap resistive plate chamber tof detectors in combination with the momentum .",
    "beam energy and centrality dependence of directed flow of charged particles as a function of pseudorapidity and transverse momentum has been previously reported @xcite .",

    "the new results reported here are the charged hadron @xmath29 in au+au collisions for 3060% centrality at @xmath3 7.7 , 11.5 and 39 gev .",

    "is observed .",
    "urqmd is qualitatively consistent with the data but does not predict the right magnitude at these energies .",

    "the proton slope decreases rapidly with increasing energy , changes its sign to negative between 7.7 and 11.5 gev , and remains small and negative up to 200 gev .",
    "in contrast , the antiproton slope , which was not reported by the na49 or e895 collaborations , remains always negative in the measured @xmath11 range from 7.7 to 200 gev .",

    "our findings demonstrate that @xmath37 shows a beam energy scaling behavior , though not perfect , that has already been established at higher rhic energies .",
    "difference in directed flow of protons and antiprotons is observed . for midcentral collisions ( 10 - 40% ) ,",
    "the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and antiprotons have a negative @xmath38 at mid rapidity , but proton @xmath39 at 7.7 gev becomes positive .",
    "the proton @xmath40 slope decreases rapidly with increasing energy up to 7.7 gev .",
    "its sign changes to negative between 7.7 and 11.5 gev , and remains small and negative at 11.5 , 17.3 , 39 and 200 gev .",
    "however antiproton slope is always negative in the measured range from 7.7 gev to 200 gev .",
    "tested models do not predict the right magnitude of directed flow but urqmd and ampt ( default ) qualitatively follow some of the features shown by the data .",
    "the beam energy scan at rhic will continue in the future to map in more detail the interesting energy range between 11.5 and 39 gev .",
    "hence results from 19.6 gev and 27 gev , which were collected in 2011 , will provide further important information to the observed beam energy dependence of the directed flow ."
