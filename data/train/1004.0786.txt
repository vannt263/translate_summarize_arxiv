    "electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) and related techniques like electron nuclear double resonance have contributed extensively to the understanding of substitutional shallow donors in the different allotropes of silicon throughout the last 50 years .",
    "@xcite on the contrary , epr had been ineffective for the study of shallow acceptors for a long time .",
    "the reason behind this asymmetry lies in the different structure of the respective dopant ground states .",
    "while the electronic ground state of substitutional shallow donors in silicon is @xmath0-like and only twofold spin degenerate , shallow acceptors states have @xmath1-character and show a fourfold degeneracy .",
    "@xcite this latter degeneracy can partially be lifted by any symmetry breaking perturbation .",
    "such perturbations , e.g.  electric fields or strain , can strongly alter or even dominate the level scheme of acceptor zeeman energies for external magnetic fields that are typically used for epr measurements .",
    "if the perturbation is not homogeneous across the sample , this can easily lead to an extreme inhomogeneous broadening of the epr resonances .",
    "therefore , the observation of a boron - related epr signal had initially only been possible under application of a strong and homogeneous external stress .",
    "@xcite    it was only in 1978 , when si became available with sufficient crystalline quality , that epr of b acceptors in externally unstrained si ( si : b ) was reported for the first time by neubrand .",
    "@xcite in particular , a correlation between the linewidths of the different boron - related epr resonances and the concentrations of c and o point defects was established .",
    "however , a number of fundamental questions have remained unsolved : ( i ) although a random strain distribution that is induced by point defects should lead to a purely lorentzian broadening of the epr resonances , the experimentally obtained lines could only be fitted with voigt profiles , taking into account a significant gaussian contribution that was found to be independent of the concentrations of c and o. the origin of this additional broadening , which dominates the overall linewidths in samples with small point defect concentrations and which shows a large angular dependence , has essentially remained unclear .",
    "( ii ) for the samples of highest crystalline purity , the lorentzian contribution to the voigt profiles did not fall below a threshold value of 10  mt which , in the model developed by neubrand , would correspond to an unreasonably high concentration of point defects . in ref .  , si interstitials were suggested as a possible explanation for this finding .",
    "( iii ) for two of the six b - related resonances , a distinct substructure was observed .",
    "it was proposed that this structure originates from a dynamic effect , however , the specific mechanism remained unknown .",
    "@xcite    karaiskaij and coworkers proposed in ref .   that the random distribution of the different stable si isotopes @xmath2si , @xmath3si , and @xmath4si in si crystals with a natural isotope composition plays an important role for the inhomogeneous broadening of b - related epr resonances .",
    "in that work , it was shown that the valence band offsets between isotopically pure si crystals consisting of different isotopes , which lead to local fluctuations of the valence band edge in the vicinity of the different b acceptors in @xmath5si , are responsible for the residual ground state splitting of shallow acceptors in this material , which is e.g.  observed in photoluminescence spectra of acceptor - bound excitons .",
    "@xcite however , it has remained unclear which of the open questions listed above can be attributed to local valence band fluctuations and whether a quantitative understanding of the observed effects is possible . in the present paper , we extend the theoretical model established in ref .   to explain the acceptor ground state splitting in the absence of an external magnetic field ( @xmath6=0 ) to non - zero magnetic fields and investigate the influence of isotope - induced perturbations on the line shape of b - related epr resonances in si with the natural and with isotopically engineered isotope compositions .",
    "we show that the inhomogeneous broadening effects described in ( i ) and ( ii ) can quantitatively be explained by isotope - induced random local fluctuations of the valence band edge in the vicinity of the b acceptors .",
    "we verify this finding experimentally via a direct comparison of epr spectra obtained from b - doped @xmath5si and isotopically purified b - doped @xmath2si .",
    "the isotope - induced broadening is discussed for different orientations of the magnetic field and different isotope compositions .",
    "additionally , the asymmetric line shape of the b - related epr resonances observed in @xmath5si , which was not addressed in previous work can quantitatively be explained using our model .",
    "we show that the random distribution of the different si isotopes in @xmath5si also shifts the effective g - values of different boron - related epr resonances with respect to pure @xmath2si .",
    "this effect is quantitatively verified by our experimental data .",
    "the crucial parameters for the agreement between this model and the experimental data are the valence band offsets between pure @xmath2si , @xmath3si , and @xmath4si , which were extracted from calculations of the temperature dependence of electronic band states .",
    "@xcite using our model to recalculate the residual acceptor ground state splitting for @xmath6=0 , we show that the 30  % discrepancy between theory and the experimental value determined by phonon absorption spectroscopy in ref .",
    "is not due to an uncertainty in the values assumed for the valence band offsets , but rather due to an inaccuracy of the acceptor wave function used in that publication . in our calculations , the best agreement with the experimental data",
    "is obtained when the assumed valence band offset between @xmath2si and @xmath3si is reduced by 8  % from the value determined in refs .  .",

    "( b ) when a magnetic field of e.g. @xmath7  t is applied , the degeneracy of the ground state is already fully lifted by the zeeman coupling in @xmath2si .",
    "the isotopic effect leads to an additional upwards shift of the energy levels which , for a given isotopic configuration , slightly varies for the different zeeman levels .",

    "@xcite the ground state envelope function of the hole is the 1@xmath0 state of a hydrogen - like atom . as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1](a ) for b in pure @xmath2si , this ground state is fourfold degenerate at @xmath6=0 due to the spin and bloch basis angular momentum .",
    "@xcite this degeneracy is partially lifted in @xmath5si due to the action of isotope - induced local fluctuations of the valence band edge in the spatial vicinity of the different b acceptor nuclei which constitute a symmetry breaking perturbation for the acceptor wave function .",
    "these fluctuations result from the dependence of the zero - point vibrational energy on the isotope mass in conjunction with the renormalization of the electronic states by electron - phonon interaction .",
    "@xcite in the ensemble average , the resulting two kramers degenerate levels are shifted by an energy that equals the shift of the valence band edge from @xmath2si to @xmath5si .",
    "however , for different b acceptors , the shift of the different energy levels will undergo slight variations depending on the specific distribution of si isotopes in the vicinity of the acceptor nucleus .    when a strong external magnetic field is applied , the situation is different , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1](b ) .",
    "already the zeeman interaction between the acceptor - bound holes and the external magnetic field leads to a full lifting of the degeneracy of the heavy and light hole states and the energy eigenstates can approximately be classified in the total angular momentum basis @xmath9=3/2@xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the angular momentum and the magnetic quantum number , respectively .",
    "for strong enough external magnetic fields , the isotope - induced effects can then be treated as a small perturbation . as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1](b ) , on average this perturbation should lead to an upwards shift of the four zeeman levels in energy similar to the situation shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1](a ) for @xmath6=0 .",
    "the assumption that this picture holds for x - band epr conditions is motivated by the experimental evidence that the measured electronic g - values of b in @xmath5si are predominantly determined by the zeeman interaction in samples with a low concentration of point defects .",
    "@xcite the isotopic disorder therefore only leads to a comparatively small perturbation that mostly manifests itself in a change of the linewidths and lineshapes of the different boron - related epr resonances .    to assess the nature and the magnitude of these isotope - induced changes , we implement our theoretical model in the following way : first",

    "@xcite however , due to their natural abundance of 19.9  % and 80.1  % , respectively , such an effect has to lead to an asymmetric resonance line , which contradicts the highly symmetric line shape of the b - related resonances observed in @xmath2si , and can therefore be excluded .",
    "another effect that in principle has to be considered for the understanding of the line shape is the hyperfine interaction of the acceptor holes with the nuclear spins of the corresponding acceptor nuclei and @xmath3si ligands .",
    "for @xmath81b and @xmath82b , the nuclear spin is 3 and 3/2 , respectively .",
    "if the acceptor hyperfine splitting could be resolved in our spectra , we would therefore expect a multiplet of lines rather than a twofold splitting of the resonance line that might be invoked to account for the central substructures . we neither observe a resolved hyperfine signature in any of our spectra nor do we need a further source of inhomogeneous broadening for the description of our spectra that could be attributed to unresolved b hyperfine multiplets or a strong superhyperfine interaction with @xmath3si ligands .",
