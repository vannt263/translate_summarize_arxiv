    "the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( galex ) , with its @xmath3 field - of - view and sensitivity to stellar populations younger than a few hundred myr , is remarkably well - suited for addressing the topic of star formation at large galactocentric radii .",
    "recent star formation within such environments has been detected in deep h@xmath1 and broadband observations of a few galaxies ( ngc 628 , ngc1058 , ngc6946 : ferguson et al . 1998a , also lelievre & roy 2000 for ngc628 ; m31 : cuillandre et al .",
    "2001 ; ngc6822 : de blok & walter 2003 ) .",
    "one of the goals of the galex nearby galaxy survey ( ngs : bianchi et al .",
    "2004 ) is to conduct a census of outer disk star formation in a statistically significant sample of galaxies .",
    "the confirmed occurrence of star formation in the outer disk of ordinary spiral galaxies has far - reaching implications .",
    "first , if massive stars are forming at large radii , then the outer disk continues to undergo chemical enrichment .",
    "this may clarify the origin of dust detected in the extended hi disks of spiral galaxies ( popescu & tuffs 2003 , a&a 410l , 21p ) .",
    "secondly , radiative and mechanical feedback processes associated with massive stars are expected to be more efficient in the comparatively rarified interstellar medium ( ism ) and uncrowded environment at large radii . in particular , the unresolved issue of production via h@xmath4 dissociation ( smith et al . 2000 , allen 1986 ) can be studied in detail .",
    "the presence of recently formed stellar complexes at large galactocentric radii also provides a simplified laboratory for investigating the star formation threshold , the ( minimum ) gas column density required for star formation to occur spontaneously .",
    "the precise workings of this mechanism remain a matter of debate .",
    "kennicutt ( 1989 ) demonstrated that star formation is rare in disk environments having total gas surface density @xmath5 m@xmath6 pc@xmath7 .",
    "martin & kennicutt ( 2001 ) showed the observed threshold gas density varies by about an order of magnitude at the `` edge '' of the star - forming disk ( @xmath8 ) in different galaxies , but the ratio of @xmath9 to a critical density ( which depends on the physical and dynamical conditions of each galaxy in particular ) is approximately constant at this position .",
    "deep h@xmath1 imaging by ferguson et al .",
    "( 1998a ) and lelievre & roy ( 2000 ) showed that star - formation regions only a few myr old exist beyond two optical radii ( r@xmath10 ) in ngg  628 , ngc  1058 , and ngc  6946 .",
    "lelievre & roy ( 2000 ) demonstrated that the region luminosity function ( lf ) slope is significantly steeper in the outer disk , relative to a galaxy - wide sample , possibly indicating a genuine change in the initial cluster mass function ( cmf ) or a population which is preferentially older .",
    "ferguson et al . ( 1998a ) noted that the outer regions appear small , isolated , and faint compared to inner disk analogs .    in this letter",
    ", we present far - uv ( fuv ) and near - uv ( nuv ) wide - field galex imagery which reveals an extensive population of recent star - forming regions in the extreme outer disk of m83 , out to @xmath11 the holmberg radius .",
    "some of these sources were discovered by wamsteker et al .",
    "( 1983 ) in deep red ( 127 - 04+rg630 ) plates , but observed properties were never published .",
    "we analyze the galex data in conjuction with visible and @xmath1221 cm imagery , to place the outer disk sources in context relative to the underlying stellar population and extended disk . _",
    "the galex data is of particular importance because it demonstrates that h@xmath1 observations will fail to detect a significant population of moderate age clusters in the outermost disk of spiral galaxies , leading to an underestimate of galactic evolution in these locales . _",
    "processes such as chemical enrichment ( ferguson et al .",
    "1998b ) , disk heating ( sellwood & balbus 1999 ) , and ism phase balance ( allen 1986 ) may be significantly influenced , given that the ( predominantly ) b star population traced by galex effectively drives these feedback mechanisms .",
    "galex ngs observations show that m83 is not unique in terms of outer disk uv morphology .",
    "we will analyze uv - visible - ir outer disk properties of a representative galaxy sample in a subsequent paper .",
    "m83 ( ngc5236 ) was observed with galex on 7 june 2003 for a single orbital night as part of the ngs , with an exposure of 1352 seconds in both fuv ( 13501750   ) and nuv ( 17502750   ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the color - composite galex image of m83 .",
    "two bright stars eastward of m83 prevented us from centering the target in the field , but our data includes most of the outer disk .",
    "rms sensitivity is 26.6(26.8 ) ab mag for fuv(nuv ) , or 27.5(27.6 ) ab mag arcsec@xmath7 expressed in units of surface brightness evaluated at the scale of the psf .",
    "boissier et al .",
    "( 2004 , this volume ) also analyze the galex m83 dataset , emphasizing the inner disk in regard to extinction and chemical evolution models .",
    "courtesy of p. crosthwaite , we gained access to the @xmath13 cm vla observations discussed by tilanus & allen ( 1993 ) . for the inner @xmath14 of m83",
    ", we also used the co map of crosthwaite et al .",
    "( 2002 ) to estimate @xmath9 as a function of position .",
    "figures 1 , 4 , and 5 pertain to the and co observations .",
    "narrowband h@xmath1 and r - band imaging of m83 was obtained using the swope 1-m telescope at las campanas observatory ( see fig .",
    "5 )    we adopt a distance of 4.5 mpc to m83 ( thim et al .",
    "2003 ) , thus the @xmath15 galex psf corresponds to a linear scale of 110 pc .",
    "accordingly , galex detections in m83 are generally not single clusters , but rather aggregates possibly consisting of a few discrete ( unresolved ) clusters .",
    "photometry of the discrete uv sources within m83 was accomplished using source extractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) to define an isophotal aperture for every object detected within our nuv image .",
    "these irregular region boundaries were then applied to both the nuv and fuv data for the measurement of background - subtracted source flux , after applying a distortion correction to the fuv image to ensure registration with our nuv data .",
    "the background for every source was estimated locally ( within @xmath16 pc ) .",
    "we measured median surface brightness as a function of galactocentric radius as described by bianchi et al .",
    "( 2004 , this volume ) with @xmath17 and pa = @xmath18 ( crosthwaite et al .",
    "m83 is considered prototypical of those galaxies showing a well - defined edge of the star - forming disk ( eg .",
    "martin & kennicutt 2001 ) .",
    "the surface density of regions declines abruptly near r@xmath19 ( 6.6 kpc ) radius ( cf .",
    "r@xmath20 , 9.6 kpc ) , suggesting that massive star formation is now confined to m83 s inner disk , despite the prominence of a rather extended disk ( rogstad et al .",
    "1974 , huchtmeier & bohnenstengel 1981 , see also fig .",
    "our galex observations modify this view .",
    "while the distribution of uv - bright stellar complexes is highly concentrated in the area occupied by regions ( tracing o stars ) , many uv sources ( tracing o and b stars ) are easily recognizable far beyond the `` edge '' of this distribution .",
    "furthermore , diffuse uv emission is also detected beyond the optically - bright star - forming disk .",
    "our galex observations of m83 revealed @xmath21 uv - bright star - forming regions and stellar clusters beyond r@xmath22 .",
    "figure 1 shows that the outer disk star - forming regions appear preferentially located on local maxima or filaments in the structure of the warped disk .",
    "the distribution of galex sources extends to the limit of the field surveyed at the vla by tilanus & allen ( 1993 ) .",
    "we suspect that additional m83 star - forming regions may be located in the remainder of the envelope ( huchtmeier & bohnenstengel 1981 ) , but this is challenging to confirm without corroborating morphology .    upon inspection of poss2 images",
    ", we found that the majority of the outer disk galex detections could be discerned in iiiaj+gg385 ( blue ) plates .",
    "however , the apparent contrast of the sources is lower in the visible than at uv wavelengths .",
    "an undetermined fraction of the outer disk star - forming complexes were discovered by wamsteker et al .",
    "( 1983 ) in their analysis of deep red ( 127 - 04+rg630 ) schmidt plates . to our knowledge , this is the only mention of the outer disk sources in this galaxy prior to the galex data .",
    "figure 2 presents the fuv luminosity function for m83 star - forming complexes in various disk locations .",
    "the outer disk complexes ( dashed line ) appear systematically fainter than their inner disk counterparts ( dotted line ) .",
    "the median fuv luminosity of the inner disk population is a factor of 3 greater than the corresponding figure beyond r@xmath22 ( only correcting for foreground extinction ) .",
    "internal extinction is likely more severe in the inner disk .",
    "thus , the intrinsic luminosity difference may be even higher than that shown in fig 2 , although we caution that blending and photometric incompleteness ( more significant at @xmath23 ) would have an opposite effect .",
    "the shape of the apparent fuv lf differs between the inner and outer disk populations .",
    "our m83 fuv luminosity function of outer disk stellar complexes is steeper than for the inner disk population .",
    "a similar trend was noted in ngc  628 for the h@xmath1 lf of regions ( levievre & roy 2000 ) . because our galex measurements represent the aggregate flux of more than one independent cluster ( or simply an extended distribution of massive stars )",
    ", it is premature to interpret the precise slope of these fuv lfs in terms of the cmf .",
    "we note that blending tends to flatten observed lfs , but the magnitude of this effect may vary with environment .",
    "high - resolution follow - up observations would resolve ambiguities related to the fuv lf and median luminosity estimates .",
    "nevertheless , the maximum uv luminosity exhibited by the population of outer disk sources implies an upper limit of about @xmath24 for the most recently formed complexes ( see also fig .",
    "we compare the observed ( nuv , fuv  nuv ) color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) for uv - bright complexes with population synthesis models of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) in figure 3 .",
    "m83 s outer disk sources have fuv  nuv colors generally consistent with ages from a few myr up to 400 myr and are generally less massive than sources with @xmath23 .    only a subset of the outer disk uv - bright sources have detected counterparts in h@xmath1 imagery . this effect could be partially due to a combination of limited sensitivity and the lower expected emission measure of nebulae in a low - density environment , but supports the view that our galex observations trace a diverse population , comprised of both young and moderate - age complexes .",
    "a distinct advantage of uv observations is to directly trace stellar , rather than nebular , emission .",
    "figure 4 presents the distribution of total gas surface density at the locations of all inner(outer ) disk sources using a dotted(dashed ) line .",
    "the local surface densities at which outer disk star - forming complexes appear to be forming are typically subcritical , with respect to the disk instability criterion ( martin & kennicutt 2001 ) . however , we caution that the outer disk measurements of @xmath9 are lower limits in two important ways .",
    "most obviously , the estimate of surface density at positions beyond @xmath25 is based only on observations , neglecting the contribution from molecular gas traced by co ( unmapped outside of @xmath14 ) . also , the resolution of the aperture synthesis map is coarse in comparison to the scale of our detections ( 50@xmath26 vs. 5@xmath26 ) .",
    "higher - resolution 21 cm observations could plausibly boost the apparent gas surface density in the local environment of the uv - bright complexes .",
    "the discrete outer disk stellar complexes lie projected against a fainter , slowly - varying field population . to place the uv - bright complexes in the context of m83 s overall star formation history , we have plotted the median fuv , nuv and h@xmath1 surface brightness ( fig .",
    "5 ) , plus fuv  nuv ( fig .",
    "6 ) , as a function of galactocentric radius . the underlying stellar population becomes substantially bluer ( in fuv ",
    "nuv ) with increasing radius .",
    "dust is known to exist in the outer disks ( and even in the extended hi disks ) of spiral galaxies ( popescu & tuffs 2003 ) and thus is likely to be present in the outer disk of m83 , too , particularly given the star formation traced there by galex .",
    "accordingly , scattered light may contribute to the emission at each position ( see also popescu et al .",
    ", this volume ) , tending to smooth the uv profile .",
    "nevertheless , the fuv  nuv profile ( fig .",
    "6 ) shows a sequence of breaks within the bright disk of m83 . outside of r@xmath22 the fuv ",
    "nuv color becomes bluer almost monotonically , indicating recent star formation dominates the uv emission . the median h@xmath1 surface brightness profile ( fig 5 . )",
    "is observed to drop off much more rapidly than either uv band .",
    "given that the dynamical timescale beyond @xmath27 is @xmath28 myr , the dropout of h@xmath1 emission compared to uv can not likely be attributed to a ( recent ) coherent decrease in the sfr at large radii . fuv ",
    "nuv measurements for discrete sources are overplotted on fig .",
