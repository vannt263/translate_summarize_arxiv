    "* critical planar percolation * is a central object of probability theory and statistical mechanics ; see @xcite for background .",
    "the best understood example is @xmath1 site percolation on the triangular lattice @xmath2 , where conformal invariance and hence convergence of interfaces to sle@xmath3 is known @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , many results are known for critical bond percolation on @xmath0 and other nice lattices , as well . in particular , almost everything in the present paper will apply equally to site percolation on  @xmath2 and bond percolation on @xmath0 .    in * dynamical percolation * , a model introduced independently by @xcite and itai benjamini , the status of each bit ( site or bond ) is continuously and independently resampled from the @xmath4 measure , at times given by independent poisson clocks of rate one .",
    "we will always consider site percolation on @xmath2 and bond percolation on @xmath0 , at the critical value @xmath5 .",
    "one of the principal reasons that dynamical percolation is interesting is that it provides a natural coupling of an uncountable number of copies of the underlying percolation process , and there may exist some exceptional instances of these copies that satisfy certain events that have zero probability in static percolation .",
    "the existence ( or non - existence ) of such * exceptional times * is called dynamical sensitivity ( or stability ) of the event , and the key event in question is of course the existence of an infinite cluster .",
    "see @xcite for a survey , but here is a brief summary of the subject .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that for @xmath6 on any graph , both the existence and non - existence of infinite clusters are dynamically stable ; then , dynamical stability of non - existence also holds at @xmath7 on @xmath8 with @xmath9 and on regular trees ; and finally , there exist non - regular but spherically symmetric trees with no infinite clusters at @xmath10 in static percolation , but with exceptional times in dynamical percolation .",
    "see @xcite for more recent results on trees .",
    "the first example of dynamical sensitivity at @xmath10 in a transitive graph was given by @xcite , proving it for the triangular lattice @xmath2 .",
    "this paper used discrete fourier analysis , a tool that was introduced by @xcite for the closely related problem of noise sensitivity of percolation .",
    "this technique was further developed in @xcite , proving that the set of exceptional times almost surely has hausdorff dimension 31/36 , and showing dynamical sensitivity of critical percolation also for bond percolation on @xmath0 .",
    "further studies of dynamical sensitivity and stability include @xcite for percolation type processes , @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5 ) for ising and random cluster glauber dynamics , and @xcite for some other processes .",
    "the rare appearances of infinite structure at the exceptional times are reminiscent of the * incipient infinite cluster * : a term used by physicists to refer to the large - scale connected structure present in critical percolation , and defined mathematically by kesten as follows .",
    "[ d.iic ] the incipient infinite cluster , denoted by @xmath11 , is the weak limit of the probability measures @xmath12 as @xmath13 , provided that the limit exists .    here",
    ", @xmath14 denotes the event that the open cluster of the origin reaches to distance  @xmath15 .",
    "( we will formulate a precise definition shortly . ) the existence of the @xmath11 for numerous lattices in two dimensions was proved by kesten  @xcite . in high dimensions , properties of @xmath16 and its scaling limits have been investigated in detail using the lace expansion @xcite . in two dimensions , several other natural means of locating large structures at criticality  such as using the above definition with the condition @xmath17 replaced by the requirement that the open cluster of the origin have size at least @xmath15 , or the weak limit as @xmath13 of the largest cluster in @xmath18 ^ 2 $ ] viewed from a uniformly chosen vertex in the cluster  have been shown to also be equal to  @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "these results support the view that , at least in dimension two , any natural means of selecting a limit of large scale critical structure is the @xmath11 .",
    "one may ask then how the @xmath11 may be found in dynamical percolation  and this question is central to the present paper .",
    "there is one very natural means of selecting an exceptional time at which the cluster of the origin in dynamical percolation is infinite :    let @xmath19 denote the random set of times at which the cluster of the origin is infinite .",
    "we define the _ first exceptional time _",
    "@xmath20 to be @xmath21 .",
    "that @xmath22 almost surely follows from the principal result of @xcite for @xmath2 and from @xcite for @xmath0 .",
    "note that @xmath20 is positive almost surely , since some positive time passes before there is a change in any bit ( be it site or bond ) in the boundary of the finite cluster of the origin in @xmath23 .",
    "the law of @xmath24 will be denoted by @xmath25 , the _ first exceptional time infinite cluster_.    although it may be a natural candidate for the appearance of the incipient infinite cluster in dynamical percolation , @xmath25 is not the right choice :    [ t.fetic ] the laws @xmath26 and @xmath11 are not equal .    proving theorem [ t.fetic ] is this paper s most complex task . roughly speaking , we show that the cluster of the origin under @xmath25 is somewhat thinner than under @xmath16 .",
    "indeed , as we will state more precisely in the next subsection , while the configuration at a `` typical '' exceptional time turns out to have the law of @xmath16 , with many other exceptional times nearby , @xmath27 appears at the endpoint of a unit - order interval in which exceptional times are absent ; in fact , finite approximations to @xmath25 may be constructed by size - biasing according to the length of the interval lacking connection from @xmath28 to a high distance @xmath29 leading up to a moment of such a connection .",
    "as such , @xmath25 assigns more mass to configurations which are liable to break apart easily under the perturbation provided by dynamical percolation .",
    "what makes the proof difficult is to detect this imbalance also in the limit @xmath30 .",
    "we will explain these vague ideas in more detail when we start proving theorem  [ t.fetic ] in section  [ s.fetic ] .",
    "it seems natural to suppose that the two measures differ to a greater degree :    [ c.sing ] the measures @xmath25 and @xmath16 are singular with respect to each other .",
    "the above intuitive explanation about how biasing by the length of the waiting time makes @xmath25 thinner than @xmath16 might suggest that @xmath16 stochastically dominates @xmath25 .",
    "however , @xmath16 does not satisfy the fkg inequality ( which we shortly review ) , and so it may be that such a general conclusion does not follow from the negative conditioning represented by longer waiting times .",
    "[ q.stochdom ] does @xmath16 stochastically dominate @xmath25 ?",
    "the invasion percolation cluster @xmath31 is an infinite cluster associated to the critical point which is built by self - organized criticality .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that @xmath11 and @xmath31 are singular with respect to each other on @xmath0 .",
    "on the other hand , although @xmath11 dominates @xmath31 on regular trees @xcite , this is not so on @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out to us by alain - sol sznitman that , instead of considering the distribution at the first entry to a given subset of the state space in a markov process , which is @xmath25 in our case , it is often more convenient to study the so - called equilibrium measure on the subset . for dynamical percolation on the ball @xmath32 and the subset @xmath33 ,",
    "this measure is proportional at @xmath34 to the probability that dynamical percolation started at @xmath35 and stopped at an independent exponential time @xmath36 leaves the set @xmath37 at the first update and does not return to it before @xmath36 .",
    "the virtue of considering this measure could be that is has closer connections to the potential theory of the markov process ( green s functions , dirichlet forms , etc .",
    "; see ( * ? ? ? *",
    "section 1.3 ) ) than the first entry time , hence it might be easier to address the analogues of theorem  [ t.fetic ] , conjecture  [ c.sing ] and question  [ q.stochdom ] for this measure .      our first effort to seek the @xmath11 in dynamical percolation",
    "was hampered by biasing created by the procedure for selection . in light of this , it is natural to try again by considering the law of the configuration obtained by selecting an exceptional time at a `` uniform '' moment .",
    "however , this notion of uniformity requires more structure on the exceptional time set in order to make sense . for this reason , and because of its intrinsic interest , we construct a local time measure @xmath38 on the exceptional time set @xmath39 as a weak limit of certain measures @xmath40 on the set of connection times to a large distance @xmath41 .",
    "the simplest construction would be to define an approximative local time @xmath42 for distance @xmath43 by setting @xmath44:=\\int_a^b \\ma_r(\\omega_s)\\,ds \\ , , \\ ] ] and then hope that these measures have a limit @xmath45 $ ] in some sense , as @xmath46 .",
    "however , we have encountered some technical difficulties in trying to prove this convergence , hence will rely on the following slightly more complicated , but still very natural definition , which turns out to be easier to handle .    a local time",
    "is supposed to measure how much time the dynamical percolation process @xmath47 spends near @xmath48 . for this , we need some notion of how close a percolation configuration @xmath49 is to satisfying @xmath50 .",
    "the simplest such notion was proposed in  ( [ e.mua ] ) : the existence of a connection to a large distance @xmath51 .",
    "but we seem to get a more canonical notion by looking at how much a finite piece of the percolation configuration actually helps in realizing a connection to infinity .",
    "namely , for any finite set @xmath52 of bits , we let @xmath53 denote the restriction of @xmath49 to @xmath52 , and define the random variable @xmath54 of course , it is not at all obvious that the limit over @xmath29 exists .",
    "however , @xmath55 whose right - hand side indeed has a weak limit in high @xmath29  this is nothing other than the @xmath11 , whose construction was carried out in dimension two by kesten  @xcite .",
    "thus , the limit in ( [ e.mo ] ) indeed exists , so that we may define @xmath56:=\\int_a^b \\mo_r(\\omega_s)\\,ds \\ , .\\ ] ] note that @xmath57 for any @xmath52 , hence @xmath58=b - a$ ] , independently of @xmath51 , and we may hope to get a non - degenerate random measure in the limit @xmath46 . moreover , and this is the main advantage of @xmath59 over @xmath60 , the sequence @xmath61\\}_{r\\in{\\mathbb n}}$ ] is a martingale with respect to the full filtration @xmath62 $ ] generated by @xmath63\\}$ ] ( see  ( [ e.muomg ] ) in section  [ s.localtime ] for the proof ) .",
    "thus , martingale convergence results can be used to prove the following :    [ t.basic ] the limit @xmath64=\\lim_{r\\to\\infty}\\muo_r[a , b]$ ] of ( [ e.muo ] ) exists almost surely and in @xmath65 .",
    "assuming that the limit @xmath45=\\lim_{r\\to\\infty}\\mua_r[a , b]$ ] of ( [ e.mua ] ) exists in @xmath65 , the two local time measures almost surely coincide : @xmath45=\\muo[a , b]$ ] for all intervals @xmath66 $ ] simultaneously .",
    "so , we now have a measure from which we wish to sample uniformly to obtain a candidate for a law coinciding with @xmath16 .",
    "however , @xmath67 is a @xmath68-finite measure on @xmath69 so that further work is needed to make valid the notion of sampling a uniform point in the measure .",
    "the next two theorems give constructions of such a point and show that indeed the law of the configuration at the selected time is @xmath16 .",
    "[ t.iicq ] for almost every realization of the dynamical percolation process @xmath70 , and the corresponding local time measure @xmath67 , there exists some @xmath71 such that for all @xmath72 we have @xmath73>0 $ ] . for such @xmath36",
    ", let @xmath74 be a random point from @xmath75 $ ] with law @xmath76 $ ] .",
    "then , for almost all @xmath70 , the configuration @xmath77 converges in law to @xmath11 , as @xmath78 .",

    "then , the configuration @xmath85 has the distribution of the @xmath11 . * given a sample of @xmath86 on @xmath69 , let @xmath87 be the poisson point process with intensity @xmath38 .",
    "one can make sense of conditioning @xmath88 on @xmath89 ; this is called @xmath90 , the palm version of @xmath91 .",
    "then @xmath92 has the law of the @xmath11 .    a concrete means of realizing the palm version of @xmath91 from dynamical percolation @xmath49 is liggett s extra head construction , which we will describe in section  [ s.iic ] ; see figure  [ f.liggett ] .",
    "another application of the local time @xmath38 could be to run the dynamical percolation process @xmath49 according to @xmath93 .",
    "it should be possible to consider this time - changed dynamical percolation as a markov process on configurations satisfying @xmath50 , with stationary measure @xmath11 ; however , even the definition of the right state - space is unclear , especially if one wants @xmath11 to be the unique stationary measure .",
    "we will not study these questions here .      in the rest of this introduction",
    ", we summarize the necessary background in static and dynamical critical percolation . in section  [ s.localtime ] , we prove theorem  [ t.basic ] , and collect some properties of the finite and the limiting local time measures @xmath42 , @xmath40 , @xmath67 .",
    "we then locate the @xmath11 using the local time , proving theorems  [ t.iicq ] and  [ t.iica ] in section  [ s.iic ] .",
    "the more substantial section  [ s.fetic ] is devoted to telling apart @xmath25 and @xmath16 , with a thinning procedure on bounded configurations being introduced and analysed in order to prove theorem  [ t.fetic ] .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ t.fetic ] in fact exploits our identification of the @xmath16 in dynamical percolation , because the proof considers a uniform right - hand endpoint of a period of connection @xmath94 and examines how long it takes for this connection to be reestablished as time advances ; in finding an answer , we will exploit the fact that the law of the configuration in @xmath32 at this endpoint time is a close relative of critical percolation given @xmath94 ( and thus also of @xmath16 ) .",
    "section  [ s.collapse ] contains theorem  [ t.collapse ] , a result addressing the question of how instances of the @xmath16 embedded within dynamical percolation typically collapse as the time parameter is tuned at short distances to the moment at which the @xmath16 appears .    as mentioned above",

    "together with some simple results on arm probabilities in the half - plane , this implies the following bounds on the number of pivotals : if @xmath155 is the left - right crossing event in the square @xmath156 ^ 2 $ ] , then @xmath157 , and if @xmath158 is the annulus crossing event @xmath159 with @xmath160 , then @xmath161 , with constant factors independent of @xmath108 .    for critical percolation on @xmath99 , we also know the existence and values of critical exponents : @xmath162 by @xcite , and @xmath163 by @xcite , as @xmath164 .",

    "<S> in dynamical critical site percolation on the triangular lattice or bond percolation on @xmath0 , we define and study a local time measure on the exceptional times at which the origin is in an infinite cluster . </S>",
    "<S> we show that at a typical time with respect to this measure , the percolation configuration has the law of kesten s incipient infinite cluster . in the most technical result of this paper , we show that , on the other hand , at the first exceptional time , the law of the configuration is different . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the collapse of the infinite cluster near typical exceptional times , and establish a relation between static and dynamic exponents , analogous to kesten s near - critical relation . </S>"
