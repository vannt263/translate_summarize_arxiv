    "quantum transport through disordered mesoscopic systems and its description by the random matrix theory ( rmt ) have been subject of an intense research for some time @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of quantum scattering is universal  it is also encountered in other physical systems , like for example in scattering of electromagnetic radiation by reflecting obstacles .    in order to study properties of the quantum transport , a two - dimensional model of the disordered wire",
    "is considered .",
    "the model , in which a number of point scatterers is randomly distributed over a strip , is continuous and yet solvable  expressions for scattering matrix ( the @xmath0-matrix ) elements can be given explicitly @xcite .",
    "therefore , by means of varying the number of point scatterers together with the length of the sample , it is possible to modify properties of the electron transport through the wire in a well controlled way .",
    "hence one can observe various types of the system behaviour ranging from the ballistic type of transport through `` diffusive - like '' scattering to the localization for a given energy of incoming electrons @xcite .",
    "the model allows to study both macroscopic transport properties , like conductance , and microscopic signatures of the scattering processes such as eigenphase , @xmath0-matrix elements statistics and time delay distributions .",
    "the aim of this contribution is to identify and investigate various regimes of the transport in the model quantum wire .",
    "the results will be compared with predictions of the standard random matrix theory of transport .",
    "the signatures of various regimes of transport in the presence of the time reversal symmetry will be considered in order to reveal regimes of the universal behaviour of the model and also deviations from that behaviour .",
    "a disordered quantum wire is modelled with a two - dimensional rectangular strip of length @xmath1 and width @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is taken ) with hard walls @xcite .",
    "there is a finite number , @xmath4 , of point scatterers randomly and uniformly distributed over the scattering region with coordinates @xmath5 :    @xmath6    an electron can enter the strip either from the left or from the right side .",
    "the number of channels , @xmath7 , in the model wire is equal to the integer part of length of the wavevector @xmath8 of the incoming electron .",
    "the scattering in the strip on impurities and boundaries is assumed to be elastic and the electron ",
    "electron interaction interaction is neglected .",
    "the hard wall boundary condition means that the wavefunction vanishes on the boundaries for all @xmath9 : @xmath10    figure  ( [ model ] ) illustrates considered theoretical model of the quantum wire .",
    "point scatterers .",

    " see figure  ( [ model ] ) ) , with the outgoing waves @xmath16 , @xmath17 in the following way :    @xmath18    the scattering matrix @xmath0 has therefore the following block structure :    @xmath19    matrices @xmath20 i @xmath21 ( reflection submatrices ) and @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( transmission submatrices ) have size @xmath24 , where @xmath7 is the number of open channels .",
    "matrix @xmath0 has a block symmetry , when @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",

    "k_n(e ) } } \\ \\exp [ i(k_m x_j + k_n x_k ) ] \\label{rnm}\\ ] ]    and    @xmath28_{jk } \\",
    "\\frac{\\sin(m y_j ) \\sin(n y_k)}{\\sqrt { k_m(e ) k_n(e ) } } \\ \\exp [ - i(k_m x_j - k_n x_k ) ] , \\label{tnm}\\ ] ]    where @xmath29 is the energy of incident electrons .",

    "conductance in the strip can be calculated using the landauer formula : @xmath38 where @xmath39 ( the spin degeneracy factor is omitted ) .",
    "the total cross - section , @xmath40 , for the scattering on a single point  like impurity can be evaluated and the result is following @xcite @xmath41 ^ 2+\\pi^2/4 } , \\label{cross}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the euler constant .",
    "the mean free path , @xmath43 , can be calculated in a straightforward way ( assuming the width @xmath44 ) : @xmath45    this parameter is important for determining various regimes of the scattering occuring in a mesoscopic sample . thus choosing parameters of the model",
    "so as to keep the ratio of @xmath4 and @xmath1 constant we are able to fix the mean free path for elastic scattering .      for chaotic scattering models",
    "there is a conjecture that the random matrix theory ( rmt ) correctly describes statistical properties of the @xmath0-matrix ensemble@xcite .",
    "given that conjecture , the statistical properties of the unitary @xmath0-matrix can be described by random matrices , which belong to appropriate dyson circular ensembles @xcite : circular orthogonal ensemble ( coe ) in the presence of the time reversal symmetry ( trs ) or circular unitary ensemble ( cue ) , when the trs is broken .",
    "the rmt yields some predictions for the mean and variance of the conductance , when there is trs present and no block symmetry ( bs ) applied @xcite :    @xmath46    and    @xmath47    the above formulae yields @xmath48 when the number of channels @xmath49 is taken",
    ".    moreover , in the localization regime the following relation holds between variance of the logarithmic conductance and the mean logarithmic conductance @xcite : @xmath50    another interesting prediction refers to the so called enhanced backscattering .",
    "one may consider average over the coe or cue ensemble of squared matrix @xmath0 elements , that is probabilities .",
    "the prediction based on the rmt yields ( @xmath51 for coe and @xmath52 for cue ) @xcite :    @xmath53    in the presence of the trs ( @xmath51 ) the probability of scattering back to the same channel is twice the value of the probability of the scattering to a different channel .",
    "when the trs is broken ( @xmath52 ) there is no longer enhancement in the backscattering  the probability of backscattering is equally distributed over all channels .      for the ensemble of @xmath0-matrices with the block symmetry ( bs ) and trs the rmt prediction yields @xcite :    @xmath54    and    @xmath55    the above formulae yields @xmath56 when the number of channels @xmath49 is taken and is slightly larger than the average without the block symmetry ( the difference is the so called weak localization correction , which also vanishes when the trs is broken ) .",
    "some properties of the scattering are well described in terms of the wigner ",
    "smith time delay @xcite .",
    "the time delay is related to the time spent in the scattering region by a wavepacket whose energy is @xmath57 . in the multichannel case ,",
    "the wigner - smith time delays are defined in terms of the matrix @xmath58 @xcite , expressed in terms of the scattering matrix and its energy derivative : @xmath59 eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath58 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , are called proper times of delay .",
    "let us begin with demonstating various regimes of the electronic transport exhibited by the model with the trs present . figure ( [ avcond ] ) shows on a log scale average conductance @xmath62 in units of @xmath63 versus length of the wire @xmath1 .",
    "the width of the strip is @xmath3 .",
    "the wavenumber of the incident electron , @xmath12 , is fixed at a value of @xmath64 .",
    "for that energy ( which can be thought of as the fermi energy in the contacts at temperature @xmath65 kelvin degrees ) there is @xmath49 open channels , and the corresponding @xmath0matrix is 10 by 10 . the number of impurities @xmath66 , so as to keep the constant mean free path @xmath67 .",
    "the average has been computed out of 500 scattering matrices , each of them corresponding to a random configuration of point  like scatterers . for a long enough sample , i.e. @xmath68 , ( and correspondingly large number of impurities )",
    "one can observe that the localization regime in transport sets in .",
    "this shows up in a characteristic exponential behaviour of the mean conductance :    @xmath69    the localization length , fitted to the data ( represented by filled triangles ) yields a value @xmath70 .",

    "the block symmetry is obtained , when the distributed point scatterers have a mirror symmetry with respect to the @xmath75-axis ( that is @xmath76 points have been randomly distributed for @xmath77 and @xmath78 and then the other @xmath76 have been obtained by the transformation @xmath79 .",
    "the inset in figure  ( [ avcond ] ) presents a double  log scale plot of the so called `` quasi  diffusive '' region , for @xmath74 , for the @xmath0-matrices ensemble with and without block symmetry compared to the rmt predictions .",
    "note , that there is an interval , where the mean conductance is roughly inversly proportional to @xmath1 , @xmath80 .",
    "fitted value @xmath81 is close to 1 .    in order to illustrate further the intermediate , quasi - diffusive regime ,",
    "let us consider the variance of the conductance for discussed above ensembles of @xmath0matrices .",

    "this defines the intermediate ( quasi - diffusive ) transport regime , which separates regimes of the ballistic and localized transport .",
    "it is interesting to look into details of the @xmath0-matrix statistics in the intermediate regime , and see if it bears any deeper resemblance to the diffusive regime than just the fact , that the mean value of the conductance and its variance have close values to the ones predicted by the rmt .",

    "this requirement is usually met in the pure diffusive regime in the quantum chaotic scattering , where there is no direct processes present .",
