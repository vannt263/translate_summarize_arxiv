    "in a last few years much attention was paid to the study of the connections among two - dimensional conformal field theory ( @xmath2 cft ) , @xmath8 supersymmetric gauge theories and integrable systems , cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite .",
    "this kind of research was inspired by the discovery of certain dualities , in particular , the agt @xcite and bethe / gauge @xcite correspondences .    the agt correspondence states that the liouville field theory ( lft ) correlators on the riemann surface @xmath9 with genus @xmath10 and @xmath11 punctures can be identified with the partition functions of a class @xmath12 of four - dimensional @xmath8 supersymmetric su(2 ) quiver gauge theories : @xmath13    let us recall that for a given pant decomposition @xmath14 of the riemann surface @xmath9 , both sides of the equation above have an integral representation .",
    "indeed , lft correlators can be factorized according to the pattern given by the pant decomposition of @xmath9 and written as an integral over a continuous spectrum of the liouville theory in which , for each pant decomposition @xmath14 , the integrand is built out of the holomorphic and the anti - holomorphic virasoro conformal blocks @xmath15(\\sf z)$ ] and @xmath16(\\bar{\\sf z})$ ] multiplied by the dozz 3-point functions @xcite .",
    "the virasoro conformal block @xmath15(\\sf z)$ ] on @xmath9 depends on the following quantities : the cross ratios of the vertex operators locations denoted symbolically by @xmath17 , the external conformal weights @xmath18 , the intermediate conformal weights @xmath19 and the central charge @xmath20 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the partition function @xmath21 can be written as the integral over the holomorphic times the anti - holomorphic nekrasov partition functions @xcite : @xmath22\\,{\\cal z}_{\\rm nekrasov}^{(\\sigma)}\\,\\bar{\\cal z}_{\\rm nekrasov}^{(\\sigma)},\\ ] ] where @xmath23 $ ] is some appropriate measure .",
    "the nekrasov partition function can be written as a product of three factors @xmath24 .",
    "the first two factors @xmath25 describe the contribution coming from perturbative calculations .",
    "supersymmetry implies that there are contributions to @xmath26 only at the tree- ( @xmath27 ) and 1-loop ( @xmath28 ) levels .",
    "@xmath29 is the instanton contribution .",
    "the nekrasov partition function @xmath30 depends on the set of parameters : @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "the components of @xmath36 are the gluing parameters associated with the pant decomposition of @xmath9 , where the @xmath37 are the complexified gauge couplings .",
    "the multiplet @xmath38 contains the mass parameters .",
    "moreover , @xmath39 , where the @xmath40 s are the vacuum expectation values of the scalar fields in the vector multiplets . finally , @xmath34 , @xmath35 represent the complex @xmath1-background parameters .    comparing the integral representations of both sides of eq .",
    "( [ agt ] ) it is possible , thanks to agt hypothesis , to identify separately in the holomorphic and anti - holomorphic sectors the virasoro conformal blocks @xmath41(\\sf z)$ ] on @xmath9 and the instanton sectors @xmath29 of the nekrasov partition functions for the super yang ",
    "mills theories @xmath12 .",
    "soon after its discovery , the agt conjecture has been extended to the @xmath2 conformal toda/@xmath42 su(n ) gauge theories correspondence @xcite , and to the so - called ` nonconformal ' cases @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , which will be of main interest in the present work .",
    "the agt correspondence works at the level of the quantum liouville field theory .",
    "it is intriguing to ask , however , what happens if we proceed to the semiclassical limit of the liouville correlation functions .",
    "this is the limit in which the central charge @xmath20 , the external @xmath43 and intermediate @xmath44 conformal weights tend to infinity in such a way that their ratios are fixed @xmath45 , cf .",
    "@xcite . for the standard parametrization of the central charge @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and for _ heavy _",
    "weights @xmath48 with @xmath49 , the classical limit corresponds to @xmath50 .",
    "it is commonly believed that in the classical limit the conformal blocks behave exponentially with respect to @xmath17 : @xmath51 the function @xmath52 is known as the _ classical conformal block . _",
    "the agt correspondence dictionary says that @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , the semiclassical limit @xmath50 of the conformal blocks corresponds to the so - called _ nekrasov  shatashvili limit _",
    "@xmath54 ( @xmath34 being kept finite ) of the nekrasov partition functions . in @xcite",
    "it was observed that in the limit @xmath54 the nekrasov partition functions have the following asymptotical behavior : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the _ effective twisted superpotential _ of the corresponding two - dimensional gauge theories restricted to the two - dimensional @xmath1-background .",
    "[ fig1 ]   sym theories with the n  particle quantum integrable systems .",
    "an extension of the above triple relation to the case @xmath57 needs to consider on the l.h.s .  the classical limit of the @xmath58 symmetry conformal blocks according to the known extension @xcite of the agt conjecture.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "the twisted superpotentials play a pivotal role in the already mentioned _",
    "bethe / gauge correspondence _",
    "@xcite which maps supersymmetric vacua of the @xmath0 theories to bethe states of quantum integrable systems ( qis s ) .",
    "a result of that duality is that the twisted superpotentials are identified with the yang ",
    "yang ( yy ) functions @xcite which describe the spectra of some qis s .",
    "therefore , combining both the classical / nekrasov  shatashvili limit of the agt duality and the bethe / gauge correspondence one thus gets a triple correspondence which connects the classical blocks with the twisted superpotentials and then with the yang ",
    "yang functions ( cf .",
    "fig.1 ) .",
    "for example , the twisted superpotentials for the @xmath0 su(n ) @xmath59 ( pure gauge ) and the @xmath60 su(n ) sym theories determine respectively the spectra of the n  particle periodic toda ( ptoda ) and the elliptic calogero  moser ( ecm ) models @xcite . in the case of the su(2 ) gauge group these qis s are simply quantum  mechanical systems whose dynamics is described by some schrdinger equations .",
    "concretely , for the 2particle ptoda and ecm models these schrdinger equations correspond to the celebrated mathieu and lam equations with energy eigenvalues expressed in terms of the twisted superpotentials .",
    "this correspondence can be used to investigate nonperturbative effects in the mathieu and lam quantum ",
    "mechanical systems , cf .  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the mathieu and lam equations emerge entirely within the framework of @xmath2 cft as the classical limit of the null vector decoupling ( nvd ) equations for the 3point degenerate irregular block and for the 2point block ( projected 2point function ) on the torus with one degenerate _",
    "operator @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the classical irregular block @xmath61 and the classical 1point block on the torus @xmath62 determine the spectra of the mathieu and lam operators in the same way as their gauge theory counterparts , i.e. :  @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , it seems that there is a way to study the spectrum of the mathieu and lam operators using two - dimensional conformal field theory methods .",
    "however , in order to exploit this possibility it is necessary to establish a full correspondence between the mathieu and lam equations and their realizations within @xmath2 cft . the missing element is to understand how the solutions of the equations obtained in the classical limit from the nvd equations are connected to the eigenfunctions of the mathieu and lam operators .",
    "it is also important to know what kind of solutions are possible to be obtained .",
    "an answer to these questions in the case of the mathieu equation is our main goal in the present paper .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "the necessary tools of @xmath2 cft are introduced . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "the simplest irregular blocks are defined and some of their properties are described . in particular ,",
    "an exponentiation of the pure gauge irregular block within the classical limit is proved at the leading order .",
    "after that , the nvd equations for certain degenerate irregular blocks are derived .",
    "section [ sec4 ] is devoted to the derivation of the mathieu equation within the formalism of @xmath2 cft .",
    "the calculation presented there provides formulas for the mathieu eigenvalue and the related eigenfunction in terms of the classical limit of irregular blocks .",
    "it is shown that these formulas reproduce the well known noninteger order weak coupling expansion of the mathieu eigenvalue and the corresponding mathieu function . in subsection [ subsect ] a factorization property of the degenerate irregular block with the light operator and its representation in the classical limit as a product of light and heavy parts",
    "is proved at the leading order .",
    "this factorization property is crucial for deriving the mathieu equation .",
    "section [ sec5 ] contains our conclusions .",
    "in particular , the problems that are still open and the possible extensions of the present work are discussed .",
    "starting from the belavin  polyakov ",
    "zamolodchikov axioms @xcite , moore and seiberg @xcite have constructed formalism of the so - called _ rational conformal field theories _ ( rcft s ) , where    * the operator algebra of local fields contains purely holomorphic subalgebra @xmath65 called _ chiral _ or _",
    "vertex algebra _ ;",
    "* the hilbert space of states of the theory is a direct sum of irreducible representations of the algebra @xmath66 : @xmath67    in rcft s the summation in ( [ hilbert ] ) is over a discrete finite set .",
    "however , one can generalize and successfully apply the moore ",
    "seiberg formalism to the case of two - dimensional conformal field theories with continuous spectrum , cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite .",
    "in such a case the direct sum in eq .",
    "( [ hilbert ] ) becomes a direct integral .    in any 2d cft there",
    "exist at least two chiral fields , i.e. , the identity operator and its descendant  the holomorphic component of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath68 .",

    "the answer to the first question needs more studies .",
    "it seems that also the second question is reasonable .",
    "let us remember that the quantum irregular block can be obtained from the four - point block on the sphere in the so - called decoupling limit of the external conformal weights ( cf .",

    "the latter case appears to be especially interesting since in the @xmath504-channel four - point block the invariant ratio is @xmath505 .",
    "hence , the question is whether we can obtain the irregular block with the expansion parameter @xmath506 .",
    "secondly , if this is possible , do we get in the classical limit the classical irregular block determining the strongly - coupled region of the mathieu spectrum ?",
    "in addition , let us note that the @xmath176 and @xmath504-channel four - point blocks are related by the _ braiding relation _ which , in general , has the form of an integral transform with a complicated kernel  the so - called _ braiding matrix _ ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , when one of the four external conformal weights becomes degenerate , then the integral transform reduces to the known formula for the analytic continuation of the hypergeometric function from the vicinity of a point @xmath174 to that of the point @xmath505 .",
    "it seems to be technically possible to take combinations of the decoupling and classical limits on both sides of the braiding relation ( at least ) in the degenerate case and to obtain as a result a ` duality relation ' for the classical irregular blocks . as one can expect , in this way it becomes feasible to establish a formula that continues the mathieu eigenvalue from the weakly - coupled region to that of strong coupling .",
    "work is in progress in order to verify this hypothesis .",
    "the derivation of the mathieu equation within the formalism of two - dimensional conformal field theory is based on conjectures concerning the asymptotical behavior of irregular blocks in the classical limit , cf .",
    "( [ clirrblock0 ] ) and ( [ clasymp ] ) .",
    "we recall that the coefficient of the irregular block expansion is a ratio of polynomials in @xmath81 and @xmath20 .",

    "it is therefore necessary to use other methods to try to prove eq .",
    "( [ clirrblock0 ] ) .",
    "it seems that there are two available approaches to solve this problem .",

    "has shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is possible to represent the gaiotto state for the pure gauge theory using the jack polynomials .",
    "the coefficients relating the jack polynomials to the gaiotto state are found explicitly in @xcite . the inner product , by means of which one computes the norm of the pure gauge gaiotto state , induces by the bosonization map and the parameter dependent isomorphism , the inner product in the space spanned by the jack polynomials .",
    "however , these jack polynomials are not orthogonal within this inner product and one has to expand them in a new basis of jack polynomials depending on a different parameter and orthogonal with respect to the induced inner product .",
    "the coefficients relating the two bases of the jack polynomials are not known explicitly .",
    "the lack of the explicit form of the coefficients hampers the effort to find the classical limit of the pure gauge conformal block .    the second and in our opinion more promising way to get eq .",
    "( [ clirrblock0 ] ) in particular and more in general analogous results for the regular blocks , is the application of the fock space free field realization of the conformal blocks . in the case of discrete spectrum",

    "e.g.  @xcite . in our opinion , also the operator realization of conformal blocks requires further work .",

    "<S> the nekrasov  shatashvili limit of the @xmath0 su(2 ) pure gauge ( @xmath1-deformed ) super yang  mills theory encodes the information about the spectrum of the mathieu operator . on the other hand , the mathieu equation emerges entirely within the frame of two - dimensional conformal field theory ( @xmath2 cft ) as the classical limit of the null vector decoupling equation for some degenerate irregular block . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it seems to be possible to investigate the spectrum of the mathieu operator employing the techniques of @xmath2 cft . to exploit this strategy </S>",
    "<S> , a full correspondence between the mathieu equation and its realization within @xmath2 cft has to be established . in our previous paper @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we have found that the expression of the mathieu eigenvalue given in terms of the classical irregular block exactly coincides with the well known weak coupling expansion of this eigenvalue in the case in which the auxiliary parameter is the noninteger floquet exponent . in the present work </S>",
    "<S> we verify that the formula for the corresponding eigenfunction obtained from the irregular block reproduces the so - called mathieu exponent from which the noninteger order elliptic cosine and sine functions may be constructed . </S>",
    "<S> the derivation of the mathieu equation within the formalism of @xmath2 cft is based on conjectures concerning the asymptotic behaviour of irregular blocks in the classical limit . </S>",
    "<S> a proof of these hypotheses is sketched . finally , we speculate on how it could be possible to use the methods of @xmath2 cft in order to get from the irregular block the eigenvalues of the mathieu operator in other regions of the coupling constant </S>",
