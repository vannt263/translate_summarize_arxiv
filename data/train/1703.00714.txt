    "distributed inference in wireless sensor networks ( wsns ) has been extensively studied for applications such as environmental monitoring , weather forecasts , health care , and home automation ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . sensors in wsns are powered typically by batteries , and hence the network lifetime is highly limited . in practice , periodically replacing or recharging batteries may be hard or even impossible ( due to the fact that sensors are located inside toxic environments , building structures , or human bodies @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , although there have been many efforts in power management policies , the network lifetime remains a performance bottleneck and limits the wide - range deployment of wsns .",
    "the optimal power allocation strategies for distributed estimation in wsns have received a great research interest both from analog and digital encoding perspectives @xcite . among encoding schemes ,",
    "the _ uncoded amplify - and - forward _ scheme has been extensively studied due to its simplicity and information - theoretic - optimality properties under certain conditions @xcite . in particular , the authors in @xcite studied power allocation for orthogonal multiple access channels ( macs ) , when the best linear unbiased estimator ( blue ) is adopted . the same problem was considered in @xcite for a coherent mac .",
    "the effects of channel estimation error were reported in @xcite for orthogonal macs adopting a linear minimum mean - squared error estimator , while in @xcite , the sensing noise uncertainty was investigated by adopting the blue .",
    "recently , the optimal transmit strategy for cooperative linear estimation was studied in @xcite .",
    "the tremendous performance gains achieved by multiple - antenna techniques highly motivate us to integrate this technology into future wireless systems including wsns .",
    "the benefits of such technology in the context of wsns have been recently studied for distributed inference @xcite . for a large - scale fusion center ( fc ) over a rayleigh fading channel , it has been shown in @xcite that the detection / estimation performance remains asymptotically constant if the transmit power at each sensor decreases proportionally with increasing number of antennas at the fc .",
    "the benefits of the multiple - antenna fc in distributed detection were analyzed in terms of asymptotic error exponents in @xcite .",
    "power allocation strategies for distributed estimation were studied for the correlated source case @xcite and for the correlated noise case @xcite .",
    "although the network life span can be prolonged by applying the aforementioned strategies , one needs a disruptive design that fundamentally changes the limitation of a wsn .",
    "one of the promising solution is the so - called _ energy harvesting _ ( eh ) , in which sensors scavenge energy from the ambient environment ( e.g. , solar , wind , and vibration ) that can guarantee an infinite life span in theory @xcite .",
    "however , due to the unpredictable nature of energy sources , eh is typically uncontrolled , and thus can be critical for some reliable - sensitive applications .",
    "in addition to commonly used energy sources such as solar and wind , ambient radio - frequency ( rf ) signals can be a viable new source for energy scavenging .",
    "most of the researches on _ wireless power transfer _ ( wpt ) have been focused on _ cellular _ networks , where user terminals replenish energy from the received signals sent by the base station via the far - field rf - based wpt @xcite .",
    "for example , the fundamental trade - off between the achievable rate and the transferred power was characterized in @xcite .",
    "several practical receiver architectures for simultaneous information and power transfer were investigated in @xcite . exploiting multiple antenna technologies in wpt has been widely studied : multiple - input - multiple - output broadcast channels @xcite , beamforming designs for multiuser multiple - input - single - output ( miso ) @xcite , physical - layer security problems for multiuser miso @xcite , and multiple - antenna interference channels @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "there are a relatively limited number of studies on wpt for _ wsns _ ; different wpt technologies for addressing energy / lifetime problems in wsns were reviewed in @xcite ; in @xcite , the authors studied a distributed estimation system in which some of the multiple - antenna sensors , named super sensors , are capable of wpt to its neighboring sensors via beamforming ; and in @xcite , several multiple - antenna rf - based chargers were used to replenish the wireless sensors and then to switch to the information transmission phase , where each sensor sent a quantized version of its measurement to the fc for estimation .",
    "for distributed estimation in wsns , an important question is how to intelligently exploit multiple - antenna technologies and wpt to improve both the inference performance and network lifetime . in this paper , we devote to studying the optimality of wpt and the optimal allocation of harvested energy for distributed estimation of an unknown random source in wsns with a multiple - antenna fc .",
    "our main contributions are summarized as follows :    * when the blue is adopted at the fc for estimation , we jointly optimize the amplification coefficients , energy beamforming , and receiver filtering by adopting alternative minimization methods ( see algorithms  [ alg:1 ] and [ alg:2 ] ) . to that end",
    ", we first solve the mean - squared error ( mse ) minimization problem under the total power constraint at the fc as well as the causal power constraint at each sensor .",
    "then , we solve a converse problem where the total transmit power at the fc is minimized subject to an mse requirement . *",
    "a key ingredient of our algorithms is the so - called _",
    "we show that such a relaxation does not sacrifice the optimality of the relaxed problems .",
    "we derive the properties of the optimal solutions ( see theorems  [ thrm:1 ] and [ thrm:2 ] ) . * a special deployment of wpt in wsns is also discussed , where a common energy harvester is used to collect energy from the fc .",
    "we show that the optimization problems are significantly simplified in this case .",
    "the optimal power  distortion trade - off is also characterized ( see theorem  [ thrm:3 ] ) .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the system model and problem formulation are described in section  [ sec:2].section  [ sec:3 ] studies the problem of minimizing the mse subject to power constraints . in section  [ sec:4 ] , the converse problem in section  [ sec:3 ] is studied .",
