    "if we have electromagnetic field in a restricted region , the vacuum energy of the electromagnetic field shows up as an effective zero point energy , which is known as casimir energy . for a rectangular region bounded by two perfectly conducting plates separated by a distance @xmath0 along the @xmath1-axis ,",
    "the magnitude of this energy is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the dimensions of the plates ( assumed large ) along the other two axes .",
    "the energy density in the region between the plates is therefore given by @xmath5    there are various ways that the magnitude of this energy density can be derived . here , we outline a method using functional integration of the lagrangian .",
    "we will show that this method easily extends to the case when the region between the two plates is at a finite temperature . using this extension",
    ", we will calculate the casimir energy at finite temperature .",
    "it is well known that the functional formulation of the electromagnetic field is complicated because of gauge invariance .",
    "the gauge volume has to be divided out by a fadeev - popov procedure . in order to avoid these complications ,",
    "we perform all our calculation using a complex scalar field of mass @xmath6 . in other words",
    ", we will calculate the zero - point energy of a complex scalar field in the specified geometry , assuming that this field satisfies the same boundary conditions as the electromagnetic field at the boundaries of the region .",
    "once this is done , the result can be applied for the electromagnetic field as well , since it has the same number of degrees of freedom .",
    "we only need to put the mass of the field to be equal to zero .",
    "let us then start from the lagrangian of a free scalar field : @xmath7 the generating functional obtained from this lagrangian is given by @xmath8[{\\cal d}\\phi^\\dagger ] \\ ; \\exp \\left ( i \\int d^4x \\ , { \\cal l } \\right ) \\ , .      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the free lagrangian is quadratic , this integration can be performed formally , and one obtains @xmath9 thus , @xmath10 using a well - known identity that for any operator , the logarithm of its determinant is the same as the trace of its logarithm .",
    "the trace mentioned above runs not only over any internal degrees of freedom that may be present ( in the particular case at hand , there is nt any ) , but also over the space - time points .",
    "thus , more explicitly , we can write @xmath11 going over to the momentum representation , this can be written as @xmath12 where the integration over @xmath13 is indefinite .",
    "the integral on the right side is , of course , infinite .",
    "this is no surprise . for a general system",
    ", the quantity @xmath14 can be interpreted as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the free energy density of the vacuum , so that we can write @xmath17 for a system at zero temperature , the free energy density is equal to the internal energy density , @xmath18 .",
    "the infinity obtained for the integral on the right side then just corresponds to the well known result in quantum field theory that the vacuum energy of a field is formally infinite .",
    "once normal ordered fields are employed , this infinite contribution vanishes .",
    "effectively , this amounts to setting the zero of energy at the vacuum energy of the field .    in the derivation",
    "above , we have implicitly assumed that the space - time region is infinite in all directions . for a more general situation ,",
    "let us denote the obvious generalization of eq .",

    ", we can employ the imaginary time formalism , where the @xmath21 values for a bosonic field are quantized in the form  @xcite @xmath22 for arbitrary integers @xmath23 . in this case",
    ", the integration over @xmath21 is to be replaced by a sum over the imaginary energies .",

    "( [ 2terms ] ) , we can perform the @xmath30 integration if the space were infinite .",
    "this would give @xmath39 this is essentially the form obtained by schwinger @xcite through his proper - time formalism .",
    "if the integration is performed now , we would get a result proportional to @xmath40 , which would be infinite , as remarked earlier .",
    "but we also said that this energy is not really relevant for us . in the casimir geometry , i.e. , in the region between two infinite conducting plates at @xmath41 and @xmath42",
    ", the component of momentum perpendicular to the plates will be quantized . for an electromagnetic field",
    ", these quantized values will be given by @xmath43 with arbitrary integers @xmath44 so that the potential can vanish at both the plates . as we said in the introduction",
    ", we will take this same boundary condition for the complex scalar field as well .",
    "thus , for the casimir geometry , we should write @xmath45 \\over ( 2\\pi)^3 } =   { 1\\over 2\\zeta } \\sum_{l=-\\infty}^\\infty \\int { d^2k_\\perp \\over ( 2\\pi)^2}\\ , , \\label{d3k }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 indicates momentum values in the plane perpendicular to the @xmath1-axis . using eqs .",
    "( [ 1stterm ] ) and ( [ omega ] ) as before , we can now perform the integration over @xmath46 to obtain @xmath47 using the standard definition of the jacobi @xmath48-function : @xmath49    the expression for @xmath35 given above can be simplified , noting that mathematically , the problem of casimir geometry at zero temperature is equivalent @xcite to the problem of infinite geometry at non - zero temperature , tackled through the imaginary time formalism .",
    "we therefore follow a procedure enumerated by dittrich @xcite for non - zero temperatures , adapting it to the present case . for this , one notes the following property of the jacobi @xmath48-function : @xmath50 which enables us to write @xmath51 putting this form back in eq .",

    "notice that , the @xmath53 term in this sum is exactly same as the result obtained in eq .",
    "( [ finf ] ) for infinite space .",
    "thus , this result is also infinite .",
    "however , the physically important quantity is the difference of this quantity and the corresponding result for the infinite space , which is : @xmath54 the integral over @xmath55 can be expressed in terms of a modified bessel function , defined by @xmath56 writing @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ 0temp ] ) , the expression can be rewritten in the form @xmath58 this result is twice that of ambjorn and wolfram @xcite , who calculated the same quantity for a real scalar field .    for the @xmath59 limit which is relevant for finding the result for the electromagnetic field , we can use the form @xmath60 which is valid for small @xmath1 .",
    "this gives @xmath61 this is the correct result for the boundary conditions explained above . as remarked in the introduction , this result is applicable for the electromagnetic field which has the same number of degrees of freedom as the complex scalar field .",
    "indeed , this result agrees with eq .",
    "( [ rhoresult ] ) , since the free energy density in this case is equal to the internal energy density .",
    "we now consider the temperature dependent part of the generating functional , which was given by the second term in eq .",

    "( [ omegak ] ) . this can be eliminated by using the identity @xmath63 using this , for the casimir geometry , we can utilize eq .",
    "( [ d3k ] ) to write @xmath64 using @xmath65 as is appropriate for this case , we can perform the integration over @xmath46 in a straight forward manner .",

    "we can write this as @xmath93 substituting the expression for @xmath94 obtained above , we obtain @xmath95 where @xmath1 is the variable defined in eq .",
    "( [ z ] ) , and @xmath96 notice again that , in the limit @xmath78 , this gives the familiar formula for the radiation pressure , which is one - third the internal energy density given in eq .",
    "( [ planckrho ] ) .",
    "the expressions for internal energy and pressure given above are valid if the region inside the capacitor plates are at a temperature @xmath20 and the outside region is at zero temperature . in an experiment",
    ", this is a difficult situation to realize , specially since the distance @xmath0 between the plates is very small .",
    "rather , a more practical scenario is when the region between the plates , as well as the ambient region , are both kept at a temperature @xmath20 . in this case , the quantities of physical interest are the differences in the internal energy and pressure between the two regions  the one inside the plates , and the one outside .",

    ", the results should reduce to the ordinary casimir results , so that the gains should equal unity , as seen in the figure . as @xmath1 increases , we see that the energy density quickly approaches the result appropriate for infinite volume .    as far as the difference between the external and internal pressures is concerned , we see that the relevant function @xmath98 increases roughly linearly with @xmath1 when @xmath1 is large .",
    "now , @xmath1 can increase either because @xmath0 increases , or because the temperature increases . in the case when @xmath0 grows ,",
    "the pressure difference , despite the increase of the function @xmath98 , decreases owing to the factor of @xmath103 in eq .",
    "( [ defh ] ) , and vanishes in the infinite volume limit as expected . on the other hand , if we keep @xmath0 fixed and increase the temperature , we see that although the difference in energy density between the external and the internal regions goes to zero , the pressure difference in fact increases with the temperature .",
    "this increase in the pressure difference is actually offset by an increase in entropy difference to keep the energy difference zero .",
