    "in the early fifties , the development of digital computers opened the possibility to perform weather forecasts using equations based on the laws of hydrodynamics and thermodynamics .",
    "the first successfull attempts have been obtained using a set of simplified equations based on two approximations , the hydrostatic equilibrium and the approximate geostrophic balance , which respectively postulate that the vertical pressure gradient force is equal to minus the gravitational force and the coriolis force is approximately balanced by the horizontal pressure gradient force @xcite .",
    "these assumptions reduce considerably the number of pronostic equations and are at the origin of the well - known quasi - geostrophic system of equations @xcite . since then important progresses have been made and up - to - date models based on primitive equations are used for forecasting purposes covering a large range of space scales and vertical levels @xcite .",
    "these are supplemented by a considerable amount of physical parameterizations to simulate cloud , rain and ice development , radiative transfers , surface interactions , and the impact of sub - grid scale dynamics , among others .",
    "the prospect of weather forecasting has rapidly raised the question of the limits of predictability . a lot of effort",
    "have then been devoted to answer this question whose basic properties were already identified in @xcite .",
    "thompson @xcite notably shows that the imperfect knowledge of the initial conditions induces a progressive degradation of weather forecasts . in other words a small error committed on the initial conditions of the system will grow in time until it reaches the size of the distance between two randomly chosen weather situations .",
    "this property , presently known as the property of sensitivity to initial conditions ( or initial states ) , has been subsequently discovered in the numerical integration of a low - order deterministic system by @xcite  based on the convection model originally developed by saltzman @xcite and presently known as the lorenz model  indicating the intrinsic nature of this dynamical property .",
    "this pioneering work has raised a lot of interest in the community of atmospheric and climate sciences , and a lot of researches have been devoted to the analysis of sensitivity to initial conditions in a hierarchy of atmospheric and climate models , ranging from two - dimensional barotropic models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , quasi - geostrophic models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "see also the reviews of @xcite .",
    "these different works have explored this property and the limit of predictability at different space and timescales and they all reach the same conclusion that sensitivity to initial conditions is a generic property of models describing the atmosphere and the climate system .",
    "it was also realized that other sources of errors are degrading the forecasts , namely errors associated with the absence of description of a set of processes , errors related to the parameterizations of subgrid - scale processes , numerical errors , boundary condition errors and external forcing errors .",
    "the three first sources are usually referred as _ model error _ , while the boundary condition errors and external forcing errors are considered separately .",
    "the impact of the presence of these errors on the forecasts has also been investigated in atmospheric models of various complexities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it is only recently that a theory has been developed @xcite , revealing the polynomial nature of the short term error dynamics , contrasting with the exponential - like behavior of initial condition errors .    in parallel to these investigations , the interest of mathematicians and theoretical physicists for the problem of sensitivity to initial conditions raised considerably and led to the development of the ergodic theory of chaos for deterministic dynamical systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and to the development of important quantifiers of the property of sensitivity to initial conditions , the lyapunov exponents .",
    "one central result of this theory is that in the double limit of infinitesimally small initial errors and infinitely long times , the distance between initially close trajectories increases ( or decreases ) in an exponential fashion with a rate , referred as the ( largest or dominant ) lyapunov exponent , which is an intrinsic property of the system s attractor @xcite .",
    "deterministic systems displaying a positive lyapunov exponent , and therefore displaying the property of sensitivity to initial conditions , are referred to as _ chaotic systems_.    the chaotic nature of atmospheric flows has been investigated using tools of ergodic theory in a hierarchy of atmospheric and/or oceanic models ranging from low - order @xcite , to more sophisticated , intermediate - order , models describing barotropic ( 2-dimensional ) flows @xcite and quasi - geostrophic flows @xcite .",
    "all the results support the chaotic nature of the atmospheric models , and by extension of the atmosphere itself .    in the real world",
    ", one is usually dealing with the dynamics of finite size errors during a finite time period .",
    "the double limit appearing in the definition of the lyapunov exponents can not be attained and leads inevitably to consider a behavior related with the local properties of the attractor . therefore in order to get information independent of the choice of the initial conditions , it is necessary to adopt a probabilistic approach .",
    "this aspect has been extensively investigated in the past years and a systematic theory of error growth has been developed in the context of atmospheric sciences @xcite  and also in parallel in the context of turbulence @xcite and references therein .",
    "the key point of the approach is to incorporate information on the inhomogeneity of the dynamical properties of the solutions on the underlying attractor .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that this practical limitation is responsible for a complex non - exponential initial behavior of the mean error for short times @xcite .",
    "after this transient period , the error at all scales follows the dynamics of the dominant lyapunov vector associated with the dominant lyapunov exponents ( provided the error is still sufficiently small ) , and subsequently saturates when the nonlinearities are playing a dominant role .",
    "similar investigations have subsequently been performed in more complex convection and atmospheric models by investigating the local properties of the lyapunov vectors associated to each exponent @xcite , and the variability of their local finite - time counterparts known as the singular vectors @xcite .",
    "this stream of ideas led to the development of what is know nowadays as _",
    "ensemble forecasts _ that are operational in many weather centers around the world and which provide probabilistic information on the evolution of the atmosphere , as discussed in several reviews on ensemble forecasts @xcite .",
    "the lyapunov exponents ( and the variability of their finite - time counterparts along the attractor of the system ) are therefore key quantities for the understanding of the predictability of the atmosphere ( and of climate ) . in the present paper ,",
    "the computation of the lyapunov exponents and of the statistical properties of the finite - time ( or local ) lyapunov exponents in a hierarchy of atmospheric ( and climate ) models , is reviewed .",
    "their relevance for the description of the predictability in highly detailed atmospheric and climate models is then discussed .",
    "section ii is devoted to a general overview of the classical deterministic modelling of the atmospheric dynamics ( together with a very brief introduction of the large - scale upper ocean dynamics ) and section iii to the description of the computation of the lyapunov exponents .",
    "results obtained with a hierarchy of low - order to intermediate order atmospheric ( and climate ) models are presented and discussed in section iv .",
    "the dynamics of the error is then described in section v. section vi is devoted to the future challenges in characterizing the predictability of atmospheric and climate flows .",
    "traditional atmospheric ( and climate ) models are based on the classical set of conservation laws of hydrodynamics @xcite . for the atmosphere ,",
    "these include mass balance , moisture balance , momentum balance and energy balance .",
    "these equations are complemented by a number of diagnostic relations such as the equation of state .",
    "the typical set of equations used for describing the dynamics of the atmosphere are ,    the conservation of momentum , @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the three - dimensional velocity field , the atmospheric density , the pressure , the angular velocity of the earth , the geopotential and the stress tensor , respectively ;    the conservation of mass , @xmath7 where @xmath2 is the density of air masses ;    the ideal gas law , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the temperature and @xmath10 , the gas constant ;    the thermodynamic equation , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the rate of heat per unit mass added to the fluid and @xmath13 , the specific heat at constant pressure ;    and the conservation equation for the water vapor content , @xmath14 , @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the evaporation rate and the condensation rate , respectively .",
    "this set of equations are often known as _ the primitive equations _",
    "they are further complemented by appropriate boundary conditions and with complicated radiative forcings and heat exchanges , all contained in the term @xmath12 , and known as _",
    "diabatic processes_. in realistic numerical weather prediction @xmath12 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 play a crucial role , and should be complemented by physical packages describing the formation of clouds , the development of rain , the chemical reactions , etc ... , and their interaction with the dynamics described above .    these equations are usually mapped to a spherical geometry at global scale or on a regional domain of interest , and often simplified by assuming the vertical scale of the motion to be small compared with the horizontal one .",
    "the equations are further reduced to a set of ordinary differential equations through spatial discretization using finite difference schemes or truncation of the infinite expansion of the field in an appropriate functional basis , or both @xcite .    starting from this set of equations , the process of forecasting consists first in identifying the phase space point that represents most adequately the initial condition available from observation based on _ data assimilation _ techniques @xcite .",
    "the next step is to compute numerically , by additional discretization in time , the trajectory of the dynamical system in phase space , also known as numerical model integration . to reach",
    "a high spatial resolution one includes the maximum number of degrees of freedom compatible with the computing power available .",
    "usually the complication of the structure of operational atmospheric and climate models precludes reliable statistical analysis or a systematic exploration of the behavior in terms of the parameters .",
    "an important class of models of the atmospheric circulation which have been used extensively for forecasting purposes , is provided by the quasi - geostrophic models @xcite .",
    "these models are obtained by adopting a number of assumptions in the full set of balance equations , the most important of which are : ( i ) the atmosphere is in hydrostatic equilibrium ; ( ii ) the wind and pressure fields are in approximate geostrophic equilibrium so that the horizontal advection is essentially described by the non - divergent velocity field ; ( iii ) the dynamical equations contain only the dominant contributions of a taylor expansion of the coriolis force .",
    "more formally , these approximations are justified through the natural scaling of the dominant large scale flows in both the atmosphere and the ocean at mid - latitudes , for which the pressure gradient is in approximate balance with the coriolis force .",
    "the predominance of this approximate balance is associated with a non - dimensional number known as the rossby number , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the typical horizontal velocity and length scales of the large scale flows and the coriolis parameter @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the amplitude of the angular velocity of the earth and @xmath23 the latitude . for the atmosphere at",
    "midlatitudes this number is of the order of @xmath24 and for the ocean of the order of @xmath25 , see @xcite for a more detailed discussion on these scalings .",
    "these simplifications led to an equation of conservation for the potential vorticity in pressure coordinates , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the streamfunction , @xmath28 , the dominant contribution of the coriolis force estimated at @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , the static stability parameter , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the non - divergent horizontal velocity field and @xmath33 contains all the dissipative and forcing terms .",
    "this conservation law and the notion of potential vorticity has been considerably exploited for the understanding of the large scale atmospheric dynamics , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "note that in this setting the temperature in the atmosphere is given by @xmath34 where @xmath10 is the ideal gaz constant .",
    "based on similar approximations , one can also deduce a conservation equation ( [ vorticitepot1 ] ) for the large scale dynamics of the upper layer of an ocean ( considered as homogeneous ) in which the potential vorticity @xmath14 is now @xmath35 where @xmath36 at @xmath29 and @xmath37 with @xmath38 the depth of the water layer , and @xmath39 , the reduced acceleration of gravity where @xmath2 and @xmath40 are the densities of two superimposed ocean layers , the lower one being an infinitely deep layer at rest @xcite .",
    "note also that an important forcing of the ocean dynamics ( present in the term @xmath33 in the right hand side of [ vorticitepot1 ] ) is the wind stress at the ocean surface expressed as , @xmath41 where the wind stress is proportional to the relative velocity between the wind in the lower atmospheric layer , @xmath42 and the flow in the ocean upper layer , @xmath43 , namely @xmath44 .",
    "the drag coefficient , @xmath17 , characterizes the strength of the mechanical coupling between the ocean and the atmosphere and is a key bifurcation parameter in the coupled model that will be discussed later .",
    "the dynamical systems analysis presented below consists first to embed the evolution of the system just described above in a space spanned by the ensemble of relevant variables , known as the phase space .",
    "typical phase space variables are the values of the meteorological fields at grid points , or the coefficients of their expansions in an appropriate functional basis .",
    "their number is usually very high ( @xmath45 or so in operational forecasting ) , unless drastic truncations leading to low - order or intermediate - order models are performed .",
    "let us now focus on the specific models that will be used in the analyses that will follow .",
    "low - order models have flourished in various fields of science @xcite , and in particular in atmospheric and climate sciences ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "these simplified models containing key ingredients of the physics of the atmosphere and/or the ocean allow for clarifying important features of the underlying dynamical properties in phase space .",
    "for the present illustrative purpose , we will make use of a model of the atmospheric dynamics at midlatitudes developed by charney and straus @xcite , referred as the cs model in the following , and a recent extension of this model developed for the understanding of the coupled ocean - atmosphere dynamics @xcite .",
    "the latter is first presented in some details and the simplifications leading to the cs model will be outlined .",
    "the atmospheric model is based on the vorticity equation ( [ vorticitepot1 ] ) defined at two superimposed atmospheric levels , say 1 and 2 , which constitutes a minimal representation for the development of the so - called baroclinic instabilities at the origin of the main variability of the weather at midlatitudes @xcite .",
    "the ocean dynamics confined to a single homogeneous layer is based on a vorticity equation with the potential vorticity given by ( [ oceandyn ] ) .",
    "finally an advection equation for the temperature in the ocean considered as a passive scalar is incorporated in the model , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the ( non - divergent ) ocean velocity , @xmath48 the radiative input in the ocean and @xmath49 the heat exchange between the ocean and the atmosphere . for more details on the equations of the model and the parameters ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the model is forced by short - wave radiations coming from the sun and an energy balance scheme is redistributing the energy through long - wave radiation emissions and heat tranfer between the two components of the system .",
    "the energy entering into the ocean is @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the emissivity of the atmosphere , @xmath52 , the stefan - boltzman constant and @xmath53 the net radiative input entering the ocean coming from the sun . while for the atmosphere the radiative input is , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is fixed to @xmath56 .",
    "it is assumed that the temperature fields can be linearized around a reference temperature in both the atmosphere and the ocean as    [ eq : lin ] @xmath57    where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are spatially uniform temperatures .",
    "it is also assumed that the atmosphere is dry and is not affected by effects associated with the development of rain , ice and clouds .",

    "@xmath72 is a free parameter varying between @xmath730,1]$ ] and @xmath74 is fixed such that the radiative input is never negative in the whole domain , @xmath75 .",
    "this choice also implies that the energy input in the non - autonomous case is reaching @xmath76 at @xmath77 at @xmath78 days ( winter solstice ) .",
    "two free parameters are present in this relation : @xmath79 , the energy input , and @xmath72 , the latitudinal contribution .",
    "figure [ insolation ] displays @xmath80 for different values of @xmath72 , the smaller the value of @xmath72 , the larger the seasonal variations . for @xmath72=0.3 ,",
    "the seasonal variation is very similar to the actual evolution as discussed in @xcite .",
    "a second important parameter largely influenced by the seasonal variations of the radiative input is the depth of the upper ocean layer , known as the mixed layer , interacting directly with the atmosphere as discussed in @xcite . in this context",
    "we choose the following relation for the ocean depth , @xmath81 where @xmath82 is fixed to @xmath83 m in most of the integrations performed below , unless it is explicitly stated .",
    "the atmospheric and oceanic fields are expanded in fourier series over the domain , @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the aspect ratio between the meridional and the zonal extents of the domain , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "one retains the following set of modes for the dynamics within the ocean , @xmath89 for temperature , the same set is used , except the modes @xmath90 and @xmath91 for which the spatial average is different from 0 .",
    "this allows to interpret the reference temperature within the ocean as a spatial temperature average .    for the atmosphere",
    ", we keep the same set of modes as in @xcite ,    @xmath92    all equations are then projected onto these sets of modes after linearizing the temperature equations around reference spatially averaged temperatures .",
    "the projection is performed using the usual scalar product , @xmath93 for the non - dimensional equations .",
    "it leads to 8 ordinary differential equations ( odes ) for the dynamics within the ocean , one equation for the spatially averaged ocean temperature and 6 equations for the anomaly temperature field within the ocean .",
    "in addition 20 odes are obtained for the atmosphere , 10 for the barotropic streamfunction field @xmath94 and 10 for the baroclinic streamfunction field @xmath95 ( also often referred to temperature due to its direct link with eq .",
    "( [ temp ] ) in this setting ) . an additional equation for the spatially averaged atmospheric temperature",
    "is also deduced .",
    "it forms a set of 36 odes which is fully described in the supplement of @xcite .",
    "the cs model @xcite is a simplified atmospheric version of the model just described above without ocean , for which the radiative input is directly introduced as a forcing of the baroclinic streamfunction equation in the form of a newtonian relaxation toward an equilibrium baroclinic streamfunction field , @xmath96 .",
    "the equilibrium solution , @xmath96 , is chosen as @xmath97 in adimensional units and constant in time .",
    "this model version is supposed to mimick the dominant dynamics of the atmosphere over a land surface with an idealized orography , which is given as @xmath98 also in non - dimensional units .",
    "the development of the fields in fourier modes is limited to the first 6 modes of [ fmodes ] , leading to 12 odes .",
    "a full description of the model is given in @xcite .",
    "the model equations are integrated in time using a second order heun method .",
    "intermediate order models have been developed in order to alleviate the limitations of high - resolution climate models whose computer time demand is very high , but still providing a realistic dynamics of the processes of interest .",
    "these are typically truncated model versions with an horizontal resolution of a few hundred of kilometers for the atmosphere .",
    "such a global model based on equation ( [ vorticitepot1 ] ) ( and denoted as qg21l3 in the following ) involving three levels along the vertical has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "thanks to the relative manageability of this model ( 1449 variables ) , an extensive analysis can be performed .",
    "the model describes the evolution of the potential vorticity ( [ vorticitepot1 ] ) at three vertical levels , 200hpa , 500 hpa and 800 hpa @xcite .",
    "the horizontal fields @xmath99 are expanded in series of spherical harmonics @xmath100 truncated triangularly at wavenumber 21 :    @xmath101    where @xmath102 , @xmath23 , @xmath103 and @xmath85 are the longitude , the latitude , the zonal and total wavenumbers , respectively .",
    "the index @xmath85 represents a total ( two - dimensional ) wavenumber on the sphere and characterizes the size of the two - dimensional horizontal structures . the prognostic equation at each level , @xmath104 , can then be written in terms of the streamfunction @xmath27 and the potential vorticity @xmath14 as @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the nonlinear jacobian operator , @xmath107 .",
    "the linear term @xmath108 accounts for the effects of newtonian relaxation of temperature , a scale selective horizontal diffusion of vorticity and temperature and a drag on the wind at the lower level whose coefficient depends on the properties of the underlying surface .",
    "finally the time - independent spatially varying source term , @xmath109 , constrains the solution of the model to an averaged , statistically stable , observed winter climatology ( `` perpetual winter '' conditions ) .",
    "note that all the fields are computed in non - dimensionalized units : the length unit is the earth radius ( 6371 km ) and the time unit is half the inverse of the angular velocity of the earth ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "the model equations are integrated in time using a leapfrog scheme ( together with a robert - asselin filter ) with a time step of 1 hour starting from a realistic potential vorticity field . the model is fully described in appendix a of @xcite .",
    "the instantaneous fields of these models are represented by points in phase space and as time elapses the phase space trajectories followed by the system s solutions tend to an invariant manifold , to which one refers as the attractor .",
    "this reflects the dissipative character of meteorological and climate phenomena .",
    "as we are interested in characterizing the instability of the flows generated by these models , let us focus on the dynamics of ( infinitely ) small amplitude errors and the computation of the lyapunov exponents .",
    "the evolution laws of a dynamical system like the ones presented in section [ model ] can be written in the synthetic form @xmath111 where @xmath112 is a vector containing the entire set of relevant variables @xmath112 = @xmath113 such as temperature , wind velocity , ... , projected on the relevant set of modes ( or grid points ) as discussed in section [ model ] .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , the initial state is never known exactly since the process of measurement and data assimilation is always subjected to finite precision . to clarify the implications of the presence of such an error we consider an initial state displaced slightly from @xmath115 by an initial error @xmath116",
    "this perturbed initial state generates a new trajectory in phase space and we define the instantaneous error vector as the vector joining the points of the reference trajectory and the perturbed one at a given time , @xmath117 .",

    "is usually considered ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "notice that the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath128 obtained for @xmath126 are equivalent to the ones of the matrix @xmath129 when @xmath130 . on the contrary ,",
    "the eigenvectors of these two matrices @xmath131 and @xmath132  denoted as @xmath133 and @xmath134 , respectively  are not equivalent due to the asymmetric character of the resolvent @xmath120 .",
    "the eigenvectors of @xmath132 are called the backward lyapunov vectors .",
    "several techniques have been developed to numerically evaluate these lyapunov exponents @xcite .",
    "one of the most popular method consists in following the evolution of a set of orthonormal vectors @xmath135 chosen initially at random in the tangent space of the trajectory @xmath136 .",
    "this basis is regularly orthonormalized using the standard gram - schmidt method to avoid the alignment of all the vectors along the unstable direction associated to the largest lyapunov exponent . after a rapid transient",
    ", the first vector of this set , free of any constraint , will tend to the direction of maximal stretching associated to the largest lyapunov exponent ; the second vector , orthogonal to the previous one , will tend to the second most unstable direction ; and so on . this set of orthonormal vectors evolving in the tangent space correspond asymptotically to the backward lyapunov vectors .",
    "these vectors and their properties were extensively discussed in recent years in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , in particular with respect to the significance of the eigenvectors of the matrices @xmath137 and @xmath138 . note that these vectors are not perturbations that are covariant with the dynamics of the error in the tangent ( linearized ) space of the phase space trajectory .",
    "other subspaces were then introduced , @xmath139 @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the direct product @xcite .",
    "any vector in this new subspace is covariant with the ( linearized ) dynamics as , @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the amplification factor , and @xmath144 .",
    "note first that the basis @xmath145 do not form an orthogonal basis and also that in the long time limit , the amplifications give also access to the lyapunov exponents , @xmath146 the vectors @xmath145 are called the covariant lyapunov vectors .",
    "the three approaches based on the forward , backward or covariant lyapunov vectors give the same lyapunov spectrum .",
    "however higher order properties like the variance of the local amplification rates are not equal whether the forward , backward or covariant lyapunov vectors are used , see @xcite , except for the first backward and last forward lyapunov vectors that have identical statistical properties as the first and last covariant lyapunov vectors , respectively .",
    "since we will focus in the present review on the lyapunov spectra and the properties of the dominant lyapunov exponent and vector , we will not discuss further the properties of the covariant vectors and will leave the interested reader to explore the recent literature on that subject @xcite .",
    "we will however illustrate what is the variability ( inhomogeneity ) of the instability properties on the attractors of the different models by investigating the amplification rates , @xmath147 , along the dominant backward ( or covariant ) lyapunov vector in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "this section is devoted to the description of the lyapunov properties of chaotic solutions found so far in the hierarchy of models discussed in section [ model ] .",

    "when the resolution of such models is increased , their validity in describing the dynamics of the atmosphere ( and the ocean ) is questionable . in this case",

    "these results are obviously suggesting that the development of very high resolution models at 1 km or smaller would lead to a very small gain in terms of predictability due to the rapid saturation of the error at small spatial scales , and one should therefore tempered us in developing such models except if the forecast at a lead time of one or two hours is providing important information for the society . in such a case a very performant data assimilation system would also be needed in order to reduce considerably the actual level of error .",
    "this is a very expensive process in terms of maintenance ( man power ) , high - quality observing systems and computer power . in the sake of reducing the potential cost",

    "this approach allows for getting more reliable ensemble forecasts as discussed in @xcite , but also for improving climatological aspects of the models such as correcting the mean or the variance of specific variables ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this however implies that an increase of uncertainty is introduced , inducing in particular a larger error for short times @xcite .",
    "another important issue is therefore to understand the role of stochastic forcings on the predictability of atmospheric and oceanic flows .",
    "theoretical and practical analyses are therefore necessary in the line of the works of @xcite .",
    "finally the problem of forecasting atmospheric phenomena on timescales longer than the typical limit of weather forecasts , say 10 days , is a challenging problem for our society . as we demonstrate in the present review in the context of an idealized coupled ocean - atmosphere model , long term forecasts of specific atmospheric variables are possible , provided the atmosphere is ( strongly ) coupled to climate components with longer typical timescales .",
    "this increase of forecast skill at seasonal and interannual timescales is already well known in the tropical regions due to the strong coupling between the ocean and the atmosphere ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "several climate forecasting models are also currently suggesting that there is some skill of the climate system at midlatitudes at seasonal and interannual timescales , although the signal is rather weak ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the understanding of the origin of this long term skill and our ability to improve the long term forecasts are still fields of research in their infancy .",
    "the exploration of the coupling bewteen the ocean and the atmosphere ( and other climate components ) in the context of low and intermediate order models are important steps in that direction @xcite",
    ".    the comments of c. nicolis and two anonymous reviewers on an earlier version of this manuscript were highly appreciated .",
