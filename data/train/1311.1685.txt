    "the famous bekenstein  hawking area law @xcite @xmath0 for the entropy of black holes connects thermodynamics , gravity and relativistic quantum field theory .",
    "this relation remains valid not only in einstein s gravity in four dimensions but in higher dimensions too , as long as the gravitational constant @xmath1 is @xmath2-dimensional and the area @xmath3 is understood as the volume of the horizon surface .    in quantum field theory ( qft )",
    "an entanglement entropy can be attributed to any surface formally dividing the system in two parts .",
    "the leading uv contribution of quantum fields to the entanglement entropy is proportional to the area of the dividing surface @xcite .",
    "this property is strikingly similar the bekenstein  hawking area law .",
    "the analogy with black hole entropy is not accidental .",
    "one may consider a black hole horizon as a surface separating the interior of the black hole from its exterior . to define a wave function of all quantum fields in the black hole spacetime @xcite one can use an analogue to the hartle - hawking no - boundary proposal . using this wavefunction one can construct the density matrix for the fields inside the black hole and derive the corresponding entanglement entropy , which is proportional to the area of the horizon , but the coefficient of proportionality formally diverges .",
    "however , one has to take into account that quantum fields on a curved background spacetime also contribute to the effective gravitational constant .",
    "it is amazing that quantum contributions to the entropy per unit area of a horizon are described by the same functions as quantum corrections to the gravitational coupling @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of the bekenstein  hawking formula as the entanglement entropy becomes even more striking in the framework of induced gravity models @xcite where the gravitational coupling is completely defined by quantum field contributions . in these models the leading uv contribution to the entanglement entropy of the horizon @xcite is given by the formula @xmath4 and is finite as soon as the induced gravitational constant @xmath5 is finite .",
    "it was also proposed @xcite that in generic static spacetimes with horizons , the minimal area surface inside the slice of a constant time may play an important role in the definition of the entanglement entropy of a black hole .",
    "recently , holographic computations of the entanglement entropy in conformal field theory ( cft ) at infinity of the anti - de  sitter ( ads ) spacetime have seen a lot of attention and development .",
    "the original conjecture for entanglement entropy by ryu and takayanagi @xcite is that in a static configuration the entanglement entropy of a subsystem localized in a domain @xmath6 is given by the formula system of units . ]",
    "@xmath7 given a static time slice ( the bulk space ) , the domain @xmath8 belongs to an infinite boundary @xmath9 of the bulk and the area @xmath10 in eq .   is to be understood as the area of a @xmath11-dimensional minimal surface @xmath12 in the bulk spanned on the boundary @xmath13 of the subsystem ( i.e. , @xmath14 ) .    the holographic derivation of the ryu ",
    "takayanagi formula for the entanglement entropy was proposed in @xcite using the replica trick . in the replica method there",
    "naturally appears a more general notion of the renyi entanglement entropy .",
    "but the qft derivation of the ryu ",
    "takayanagi relation based on the calculation of renyi entropies requires a different approach @xcite . in qft with gravity duals ,",
    "formula was proven for @xmath15 @xcite . in a more general case of euclidean gravity solutions without killing vectors ,",
    "arguments supporting the validity of the ryu - takayanagi formula were given in @xcite .",
    "in the last few years the conjecture by ryu and takayanagi has been generalized to gravity theories with higher curvature interactions @xcite or some other deformations of the gravity theory @xcite .",
    "an excellent up - to - date review of the entanglement entropy and black holes can be found in @xcite .",
    "calculation of entanglement entropy for a subsystem localized in two disjoint regions is particularly interesting , since it can be used as a probe of confinement @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated @xcite that in confining backgrounds there are generally more solutions for minimal surfaces in the bulk spanned on the boundaries of these disjoint regions .",
    "however , there is a maximum distance between the regions beyond which the tube - like minimal surface connecting both components ceases to exist .",
    "there is also a critical scale beyond which a solution with disconnected minimal surfaces dominates over the connected one . in the qft language",
    "this critical behavior is analogous to a deconfinement transition at a finite temperature .    in the case of a few disjoint regions the minimal surfaces connecting their boundaries",
    "are generally not unique and their areas differ .",
    "the conventional wisdom is that the entanglement entropy is related to the surfaces of minimum area .",
    "this choice guarantees the required strong subadditivity property @xcite of the entanglement entropy",
    ". there were some proposals @xcite how to modify this `` least area '' rule while still satisfying the strong subadditivity property .",
    "in this paper we study minimal surfaces in the pure ads spacetime .",
    "we show that many properties of the entanglement entropy , such as the critical behavior @xcite demonstrated for the asymptotically ads spacetimes with black holes in the bulk , exist already in the pure ads .",
    "the main result is that we are able to find exact solutions for all minimal surfaces spanned on one or two spherical boundaries positioned arbitrarily at conformal infinity @xmath16 . in this short paper",
    "we give analytical formulas for the regularized and renormalized area of these minimal surfaces .",
    "the explicit form of the surfaces and its derivation is presented in a more detailed paper @xcite .",
    "we also shortly discuss the spacetime character of a minimal surface spanned on two accelerated spherical domains .",
    "we start with geometrical preliminaries concerning the bulk space and with the characterization of the spherical domains at infinity .",
    "we will discuss only a ads spacetime although most of the discussion can be extended to higher dimensions .",
    "the ads spacetime has many killing symmetries and can be viewed as a static spacetime in various ways .",
    "however , in all cases the spatial section  the bulk space  has the hyperbolic geometry of lobachevsky space . to describe it",
    ", we use cylindrical coordinates @xmath17 and poincar coordinates @xmath18 in which the metric reads @xmath19 here , @xmath20 is the characteristic scale describing the radius of curvature of ads , as well as of its spatial section .",
    "the coordinates are related by @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , with @xmath24 .",
    "the conformal infinity @xmath16 of the spatial section is the conformal sphere . in cylindrical",
    "coordinates it is given by @xmath25 , @xmath26 . in poincar",

    "therefore we do not have any quantity measuring a ` size ' of spherical boundaries at infinity .",
    "however , in many calculations , both in the bulk or at infinity , we need to regularize various quantities . instead of working at @xmath16 we restrict on some cut - off surface at large finite size",
    ". then we can measure the sizea of the circular boundaries using the geometry on the cut - off surface .",
    "but , since the choice of the cut - off can be rather arbitrary , the regularized size of the spherical boundary can be only an intermediate quantity , and physically measurable quantities should be cut - off independent .",
    "two circular boundaries can be in three qualitatively distinct positions : ( i ) disjoint boundaries ( corresponding hyperplanes are ultraparallel ) , ( ii ) boundaries crossing each other ( the hyperplanes intersect in a line ) , and ( iii ) boundaries touching in one point ( the corresponding hyperplanes are asymptotic ) .    in the first case we can define the distance of the boundaries as a distance of the corresponding hyperplanes . to the crossing circular boundaries we can assign an angle of the corresponding hyperplanes .",
    "finally , all pairs of touching boundaries are equivalent .",
    "indeed , all pairs of asymptotic hyperplanes in an arbitrary position are isometric to each other . in global hyperbolic space",
    "there is no measure which could distinguish them .",
    "now we review known results for a minimal surface spanned on one circular boundary .",
    "such a minimal surface is trivial : it is the hyperplane which defines the boundary .",
    "if we choose the axis of the cylindrical coordinates perpendicular to the hyperplane , the hyperplane is given by @xmath31 . if we choose the axis inside the hyperplane , the hyperplane is given by @xmath32 . in the poincar coordinates the hyperplane is represented as a plane orthogonal to the infinity surface @xmath33 or as a hemisphere with the center at @xmath33 ( here we used a language of the conformally related euclidian geometry with cartesian coordinates @xmath18 ) .    to demonstrate different regularizations used later , we can write down the area of a hyperplane measured up to a cut - off . for the hyperplane othogonal to the axis we have @xmath34\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath35 , with @xmath36 , is the circumference of the circular boundary on the cut - off surface @xmath37 .    for the hyperplane which contains the axis we have @xmath38\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath39 , with @xmath40 , is the length of the boundary at the cut - off surface .",
    "in this case , the circular boundary is represented by two lines @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath32 .",
    "we thus have to introduce two cut - offs : an ultraviolet one , @xmath43 , in the direction away from the axis , and an infrared one , @xmath44 , along the axis .",
    "finally , the area of the hyperplane represented by a half - plane in the poincar coordinates , say @xmath45 , is @xmath46 @xmath47 is again the length of the circular boundary at the cut - off surface @xmath48 .",
    "it is also infrared divergent : one has to cut - off the @xmath49 direction at @xmath50 .    in all three cases",
    "we recognize the well - known property that the leading diverging term of the minimal surface is ( up to a constant scale ) given by the regularized size of the boundary at infinity .",
    "clearly , the exact expression for the divergent term depends on the regularization scheme , however , in all cases it can be interpreted as the regularized size of the boundary at infinity @xcite .    the area of the trivial minimal surface spanned on one circular boundary can be used to eliminate the infinite contributions to the area for more complicated surfaces .",

    "we see that the shallow tube has always smaller area than the deeper one .",
