    "the non - linear @xmath7 @xmath2-model which describes an @xmath1-component spin field has thus far found many applications in theoretical physics . in condensed matter physics",
    "it has been investigated to study , e.g. ferromagnets . in elementary particle physics , on the other hand , the model in two dimensions shares with qcd many common properties",
    "; on the quantum level it is like qcd renormalizable @xcite , asymptotically free according to perturbation theory @xcite and thought to have a mass gap @xmath4 .",
    "in addition , the o(3 ) model has instanton solutions .",
    "further , the @xmath2-model has an additional advantage : because of low dimensionality it is simple to simulate numerically .",
    "therefore , in many cases the model can be used for tests of new ideas in lattice theories .",
    "one of the most interesting properties of the @xmath2-model is the existence of an infinite set of conserved non - local quantum charges @xcite . from these , one can exclude particle production and also derive the `` factorization equations '' directly . using these properties",
    ", one can then determine the @xmath8-matrix exactly up to cdd - ambiguity @xcite , provided the particle spectrum of the model is known @xcite . furthermore , the cdd - ambiguity can also be restricted with help of the assumption that there are no bound states .",
    "the absence of the bound states was shown in the @xmath9-expansion to the order of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "further , the exact @xmath8-matrix constructed in this way was confirmed by the same method to the second order in @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "since there is only one scale in the model , one can , in principle , express all physical quantities with help of this scale .",
    "in particular , the mass gap of the theory is proportional to the @xmath5-parameter .",
    "this situation is similar to what happens in qcd with massless quarks where the @xmath5-parameter sets the scale for scale violations , for example , in deep inelastic scattering .    using the exact @xmath8-matrix ,",
    "a few years ago hasenfratz , maggiore and niedermayer succeeded in an analytic determination of the ratio @xmath10 in the @xmath7 @xmath2-model @xcite . in this derivation , however , various assumptions including the thermodynamical bethe ansatz are made , which are plausible , for which , however , the rigorous proofs are still lacking .",
    "an independent calculation of @xmath10 is therefore desirable .    in the literature",
    "@xcite , lscher , weisz and wolff estimated the ratio @xmath10 by measuring the coupling @xmath3 running with the volume @xmath11 of the system in units of the physical mass gap @xmath4[=@xmath12 by means of monte carlo simulations and applying the measurements to the perturbative expression of @xmath5-parameter in this scheme .",
    "although their determination of @xmath10 where @xmath5 was evaluated up to three loops in perturbation theory reproduces that of hasenfratz et .",
    "al quite well , the agreement of two results was still not completely undisputable . in order to determine @xmath10 more precisely , we decided to evaluate the @xmath5-parameter to one loop order higher .",
    "this requires the calculation of the finite volume mass gap @xmath0 at 3-loop level .",
    "our work is also interesting in another respect .",
    "it is generally accepted that the @xmath7 @xmath2-model is asymptotically free .",
    "this assumption was , however , questioned by patrascioiu and seiler @xcite . since in the determination of @xmath10 by hasenfratz et al .",
    "the validity of the asymptotic freedom was required , the confirmation of their result through our independent determination will , at the same time , support the correctness of asymptotic freedom .    the work is arranged as follows . in the next chapter ,",
    "we present our 3-loop calculations of the finite volume mass gap @xmath0 . by computing the spin - spin correlation function ,",
    "we first evaluate the mass gap on a lattice .",
    "we then take the continuum limit and finally convert it to the ms - scheme . in chapter",
    "[ cha3 ] , we apply the result to the determination of mass gap @xmath4 in units of the @xmath5-parameter in the o(3 ) and o(4 ) models .",
    "two approaches will be considered .",
    "first , we introduce the mass shift @xmath13/m$ ] which is known for @xmath14 and match this with the perturbative @xmath0 @xcite . as a second approach ,",
    "we determine @xmath4 by applying the monte carlo measurements of the running coupling @xmath15 to the perturbative @xmath5-parameter @xcite .",

    "@xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath11 are fixed integers with @xmath20 .",
    "we work with periodic boundary conditions in space direction and , for reasons which will become clear below , free boundary conditions in time direction .",
    "the action is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the bare coupling constant .",
    "the forward and backward lattice derivatives are defined by @xmath23 @xmath24 is the unit vector to the positive @xmath25-direction ( @xmath26 ) .",

    "concerning the energy spectrum , there is a following possibility for the calculation of the mass gap @xmath0 in finite volume for @xmath30 .",
    "we calculate the expectation value of the spatially averaged spin - spin correlation function in the limit @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) : @xmath33 if the bare coupling @xmath22 is fixed , the correlation function @xmath34 converges to the vacuum expectation value of the 2-point function for spin field operators at large @xmath19 independently of whether one chooses free or periodic boundary conditions in the time direction . in perturbation theory",
    ", we are , however , first expanding in powers of the coupling @xmath22 and then let @xmath19 go to infinity .",
    "therefore , we can not , in general , have such a converging behavior , and one requires a proper choice of boundary conditions to get the desired vacuum expectation value .    in free boundary conditions , we are projecting on states which are o(@xmath1 ) invariant at large times .",
    "the energies @xmath35 in these states , on the other hand , have the property @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the ground state energy . except for the ground state , all these states",
    "are therefore exponentially suppressed at large @xmath19 and we arrive at the desired vacuum expectation value even though we are first expanding in powers of @xmath22 @xcite .    after having taken @xmath19 to infinity so that @xmath34 been reduced to the vacuum expectation value of the product of two spin field operators , only the vector intermediate states contribute .",
    "the energy @xmath38 of the first excited state of this system has the property @xmath39 for the energies of the other higher excited states , eq.([posen ] ) is valid and their contribution to the spin correlation function hence vanishes exponentially at large @xmath40 .    from this consideration , the mass gap @xmath0 which is defined by the l.h.s of eq.([lowestexen ] )",

    "are illustrated in figures  ( [ fd2 ] ) and ( [ fd3 ] ) which are presented in appendix  a due to the very large number of the diagrams . in carring out wick s contractions from them",

    "we therefore achieve the best approxiamation to the limit @xmath51 by keeping @xmath54 .    the numerical work , however , turned out to be very complicated due to the problems caused by rounding errors and running time which increases with @xmath11 very quickly ( in the order of @xmath55 ) .",
    "in addition , problems appear from the fact that on the 3-loop level on which we are working there are extremely many terms to treat .",
    "one needs therefore a very efficient computer program which requires , among others , the free propagator running fast without significant loss of precision . in this way",
    ", we succeeded in evaluating all diagrams up to @xmath56 with good enough precision and reasonable running time ( for @xmath56 we needed the cpu time of around 7 days on the ibm risc 6000/32h ) , so that we could extrapolate to the continuum limit to get our desired results .    with regard to the extrapolation to the continuum limit",

    "this is , of course , only the case if @xmath49 calculated by us contains the terms diverging logarithmically with @xmath11 , so that they cancel exactly with the other divergent factors of eq.([condelta4 ] ) in a non - trivial way .",
