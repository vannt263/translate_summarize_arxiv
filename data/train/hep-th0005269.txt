    "the calculation of the one - loop energy of an arbitrary static background field configuration is a problem in field theory that has received much attention over the years .",
    "( for a small sampling of previous papers , see refs",
    ".   and references therein . ) various complications arise when one deals with field configurations with non - trivial spatial dependence , as extra care is required to relate renormalization of the effective action for such a field configuration to the renormalization used in the perturbative sector of a theory .",
    "to illustrate this situation , let us recall the result for the kink mass in 1 + 1-dimensional @xmath0 scalar field theory .",
    "the typical way of computing one - loop corrections involves the summation over zero - point energies computed in the presence of a kink , and subsequent subtraction of the contribution from the vacuum sector .",
    "the necessary regularization is a rather delicate procedure , and it has been recognized some time ago that the naive use of a momentum - cutoff regulator leads to an incorrect answer @xcite . of course , the fact that the one - loop calculation of the kink mass could be performed analytically is directly related to the special form of the kink solution for which the spectrum of the fluctuation operator in the kink background is exactly known .    for a generic background field configuration ,",
    "the situation becomes more problematic as there is no general procedure for solving the eigenvalue problem analytically , and thus one must rely on numerical methods .",
    "this means that the sum over zero - point energies must be regularized properly , and this regularization procedure must leave one with a well - defined regulator - independent integral accessible to numerical evaluation .",
    "the recent paper gives one approach for providing an unambiguous regularization of the sum over zero - point energies , based on the subtraction of successive born approximations for scattering phase shifts .",
    "having rendered the zero - point sum finite by this subtraction , one may then add the subtracted terms back in a regularized form , and observe that the regulator dependence cancels appropriate counterterm contributions contained in the classical expression for the energy .    however , the approach of ref .",
    "can become complicated as one goes to higher dimensions ( as higher order approximations for the phase shifts are needed ) , or encounter fluctuation operators that couple multiple fluctuating fields , as one inevitably does in gauge theories .",
    "it is therefore desirable to have a method that would allow a more computationally straightforward treatment of ultraviolet divergences .",
    "we will discuss an alternative method , specifically applicable to kink - type field configurations that depend non - trivially on only a single spatial coordinate , which naturally simplifies the treatment of ultraviolet divergences and also allows one to deal with the other problems that appear in the treatment of gauge theories .",
    "the crucial feature of the method we describe is the departure from the conventional summation over zero - point energies .",
    "instead , we go back to the functional determinants that enter the one - loop effective action , and express them in terms of the solutions to associated differential equations with certain boundary conditions .",
    "we examine two specific examples to illustrate the main ideas .",
    "one natural choice is , of course , the classic case of 1 + 1-dimensional scalar @xmath0 field theory .",
    "this simple case provides us with a consistency check , as the value of kink mass can be computed independently by an analytic calculation .",
    "in addition , working with two - dimensional @xmath0 theory presents an opportunity to illustrate the relevant ideas in a simple context .",
    "we then examine three - dimensional scalar electrodynamics .",
    "this theory has a first order phase transition ( as the scalar mass is varied ) separating coulomb and higgs phases .",
    "but the existence of a first order transition , and hence the presence of a degenerate ground state , is only apparent when one - loop quantum corrections are included .",
    "hence , computing the interface tension ( or domain wall energy density ) at the phase transition requires the evaluation of the effective action of field configurations which are not classical solutions of the underlying classical field theory . to our knowledge",
    ", our approach provides the first practical technique for computing one - loop energies of arbitrary higgs field profiles with one - dimensional spatial dependence in a gauge theory .",
    "three - dimensional scalar qed can be viewed as a low energy effective theory for four - dimensional scalar qed at finite temperature .",
    "the domain wall surface tension in the three - dimensional theory translates into the surface tension of an interface that separates hot and cold phases of the finite temperature theory .",
    "this quantity has been a subject of several investigations in electroweak theory @xcite , and scalar electrodynamics has often been used as a toy model@xcite . the desire to have a way of correctly computing",
    "the full one - loop interface tension in electroweak theory was part of the motivation for this work .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we consider two - dimensional scalar @xmath0 theory .",
    "the results of this section are not new , but this toy model provides an useful playground for setting up notation , introducing the basic ideas of our method , identifying possible problems , and developing appropriate tools for solving them .",
    "in section 3 , we consider three - dimensional scalar qed .",
    "we show how to deal with the difficulties associated with the absence of degeneracy of the ground state at the tree level .",
    "we also show how the scheme used to compute one - dimensional determinants in section 2 may be extended to deal with a fluctuation operator that couples together more than one field .",
    "numerical results are presented at the end of this section , where we show that they are consistent with expected behavior in the limit of a small ratio of scalar and gauge couplings .",
    "in this section we will be concerned with our toy model , double well scalar @xmath0 field theory in two dimensions .",
    "we start by formulating the theory and introducing our notation .",
    "we then review the traditional way of calculating one - loop corrections to the energy of an arbitrary field configuration by summing over zero - point energies .",
    "we implement this prescription and compute the one - loop correction to the kink mass using dimensional regularization .",
    "this warm - up computation , which reproduces old results , will serve to illustrate the difficulties that one faces in generalizing this approach to arbitrary field configurations and more complicated theories .",
    "we will argue that the integration over one of the directions ( euclidean time ) , which reduces the functional determinant to a sum over zero - point energies , does not come without a price .",
    "as we will see , this approach forces one to resort to computationally inconvenient ways of regulating ultraviolet divergences .",
    "we then introduce an alternative method that does not rely on the summation of zero - point energies .",
    "we show how one can make the issue of ultraviolet regularization simple by integrating over the momentum in the direction of spatial variation of the field profile , instead of integrating over the euclidean frequency .",
    "we relate the resulting one - dimensional functional determinants to solutions of associated differential equations , and present an explicit formula for the mass of an arbitrary field configuration that connects the two minima of the effective potential .",
    "the value of the one - loop correction to the kink mass is reproduced as a check of this general result .",
    "consider scalar @xmath0-theory with the double well potential @xmath2 which exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking at the tree level .",
    "this feature persists quantum - mechanically due to the @xmath3 symmetry .",
    "we consider a euclidean version of this theory formulated inside a finite @xmath4-dimensional box with dirichlet boundary conditions for the fluctuating fields .",
    "formulating a theory in a variable number of dimensions allows us to use dimensional regularization , even though the final results of this section will only apply to the two - dimensional theory .",
    "we will be dealing with field configurations that vary only along a single direction .",
    "we will assign the subscript @xmath5 to this direction , and the relevant coordinate will be denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "the coordinates along all other directions are denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "we will refer to these directions as `` worldvolume '' coordinates in obvious analogy with d - branes in string theory .",
    "we will denote by @xmath8 the half - length of the box in the direction parameterized by @xmath6 , and by @xmath9 the volume of an ( @xmath10)-dimensional slice @xmath11 . both @xmath8 and @xmath9 will be taken to infinity at the end of the calculation , leaving us with the theory in infinite euclidean space .",

    "the tree - level value of @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 .",
    "we require the field profile to approach the limiting values at @xmath17 fast enough so that the energy density @xmath18 , which is related to the effective action @xmath19 $ ] as @xmath20 } { v_{\\| } } , \\ ] ] is finite.=0 $ ] . ]",
    "the effective action can be evaluated perturbatively and is equal to the classical action evaluated at the given field profile plus quantum corrections . retaining only one - loop corrections , one has the following expression for @xmath18 : @xmath21      + \\lim_{v_{\\| } , l \\rightarrow \\infty } \\left [      \\frac{1}{2v_{\\| } }       \\ln \\ , \\det   \\frac{\\delta } { \\delta^{(0 ) } }       \\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the fluctuation operator in the non - zero background field sector , while @xmath23 is the corresponding fluctuation operator in the vacuum sector .",
    "we can split @xmath18 into three parts that correspond , respectively , to the piece of the classical energy density that contains only renormalized parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the one - loop quantum corrections , and the counterterm contribution to the classical energy density , @xmath26 the classical piece @xmath27 , and the quantum correction combined with the counterterm contribution , @xmath28 , will each be uv - finite .    the terms that enter ( [ splitting ] ) are given by @xmath29,\\ ] ] @xmath30,\\ ] ] and @xmath31.\\ ] ]    in eq .",

    "the conventional approach to computing the one - loop energy relies on making ( [ sigma_qu2 ] ) into a sum of zero - point energies . to accomplish this ,",
    "one chooses one of the worldvolume directions to play the role of euclidean time , and integrates over the corresponding component of @xmath39 .",

    "below we will re - evaluate the one - loop correction ( [ sigma_qu_sum ] ) to the mass of a kink in the scalar ( 1 + 1)-dimensional @xmath0 theory using dimensional regularization .",
    "the answer has been known for quite a long time , but it is interesting to see how dimensional regularization can naturally avoid various regularization - related subtleties which appear in more traditional treatments .",
    "the primary purpose of this computation , however , is to illustrate that the direct use of dimensional regularization applied to ( [ sigma_qu_sum ] ) ( without prior subtraction of born approximations as in ) for an arbitrary field configuration is not desirable .",
    "the computation that we are about to present is feasible only because the fluctuation operator for this particular field profile is nice enough that its spectrum can be obtained analytically .",
    "let us again go back to the theory formulated in @xmath4 dimensions , keeping in mind that physical results will be obtained via the limit @xmath44 .",
    "the quartic coupling is only multiplicatively renormalized to one - loop order : @xmath45 with @xmath25 bearing the dimension of mass squared ; its beta function vanishes in the physical limit @xmath44 .",
    "the relation between the @xmath46-dependent renormalized parameter @xmath47 and the bare parameter @xmath48 can be fixed by a calculation of the one - loop correction to the self - energy in the perturbative sector of a theory ( which is defined with respect to one of the degenerate ground states ) .",
    "this correction has a pole at @xmath49 . to render the self - energy finite",
    ", the counterterm must also have a pole with the same residue .",
    "one has , of course , the freedom to add some finite quantity to the counterterm .",
    "we exploit this freedom by choosing @xmath50-subtraction , which in the two - dimensional theory is defined as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is euler s constant .",
    "it is easy to determine the one - loop beta function of @xmath53 : @xmath54 to calculate the kink mass we set the background field configuration @xmath12 equal to the classical kink solution , @xmath55    as in ( [ splitting ] ) , the kink mass @xmath56 can be split into classical , quantum , and counterterm contributions : @xmath57 by direct evaluation of ( [ sigma_cl ] ) , the renormalized part of the classical contribution , which we conventionally denote by @xmath58 , is given by @xmath59 while the explicit form of the counterterm contribution ( [ sigma_c.t . ] ) is @xmath60    the quantum piece @xmath61 can be calculated using ( [ sigma_qu_sum ] ) and the spectrum of the operator @xmath41 .",

    "the last term involves a difference between the contributions from the kink and vacuum sectors , which do not cancel because of the differing spectral densities in these sectors .    substituting ( [ delta_prime ] ) into ( [ kink_mass ] )",

    "the second , third , and fourth terms are finite , and equal @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 respectively .",
    "one way to obtain these results is to formally rewrite each of the corresponding ( @xmath71)-dimensional integrals as a product of an angular integral which is equal to @xmath72 and a radial integral which can be shown to contain a @xmath73 pole that cancels the zero in inverse gamma function , leading to a finite expression in the limit @xmath44 .",
    "the last term in ( [ sigma_kink_qu ] ) can be computed along the same lines , @xmath74 it obviously produces a pole that cancels the pole in @xmath75 , leaving logarithmic dependence on the scale @xmath46 .",
    "this is completely analogous to what happens when one does conventional @xmath50 regularization in the perturbative sector .",
    "we are now in position to collect all the terms together , and remove the uv regulator by taking the @xmath44 limit .",

    ", we must establish a relation between the @xmath50 mass @xmath47 and other @xmath46-independent physical quantities .",
    "the renormalized mass @xmath78 used in ref . was defined by the condition that the one - loop effective potential has its minima fixed at @xmath79 .",
    "this corresponds to the complete cancellation of the tadpole diagrams by the counterterm .",
    "the relation between @xmath78 and @xmath47 to one - loop order is given by @xmath80 substituting this into eq .",
    "( [ kink_mass ] ) gives @xmath81 m.\\ ] ] which coincides with the well - known result for the kink mass of ref . .",
    "the most important lesson that should be learned from this calculation is that it would be very difficult to generalize this dimensional continuation approach to the case of an arbitrary field configuration .",
    "indeed , the discussion below ( [ sigma_kink_qu ] ) shows that even after @xmath82 cancels the pole in the quantum part of @xmath18 , taking the @xmath44 limit is still a bit subtle .",
    "namely , it involves the cancellation of a zero from the angular integral with a pole from the analytic continuation of the radial integral .",
    "this procedure would be hard to implement in general , as the radial integral for an arbitrary field configuration can only be evaluated numerically",
    ". therefore one must consider other ways of regulating a theory , or abandon the zero - point energy approach .",
    "the former option is chosen in , while the latter choice is going to be explored below .",
    "one may compute the one - dimensional functional determinant in ( [ sigma_qu2 ] ) directly , without converting it to a sum over zero point energies . the benefit , as we have already advertised ,",
    "will be the ability to reduce the computation of the quantum correction to the energy of an arbitrary field profile , @xmath28 , to a finite integral that can be evaluated numerically .",
    "it should be clear that the only reason for this procedure not being completely trivial is the existence of ultraviolet divergences in the theory .",
    "our aim is the establishment of a regulator - independent method , which clearly separates the divergences and allows one to use any conventional regularization scheme in dealing with them .",
    "we will start the analysis of the ultraviolet divergences by considering an expansion of the functional determinant in ( [ sigma_qu1 ] ) in powers of @xmath84 : @xmath85.\\ ] ] in two dimensions , only the first term in this expansion is divergent .",

    "contains an integral that appears in the evaluation of the tadpole diagram , and needs to be regulated .",
    "we indicate this by writing @xmath91 , which should be thought of as some cutoff on worldvolume momentum , at the top of this integral .",
    "however we can use any regulator we like , as long as it allows unbounded integration over @xmath83 .",
    "the same tadpole diagram also contributes to the mass renormalization in the perturbative sector , and consecutively , appears in @xmath82 . comparing ( [ sigma_c.t . ] ) and ( [ p ] ) one can immediately see that the uv - divergent terms in ( [ sigma_qu_22 ] ) cancel each other , leaving a finite remainder whose value depends on the renormalization conditions .",
    "thus , the only non - trivial piece of the calculation is the evaluation of a single one - dimensional integral . the expression ( [ sigma_qu_22 ] )",
    "is , therefore , a key result of this section . note , that had the number of dimensions @xmath4 been greater than two , more subtractions might have been needed .",
    "the structure of such terms would be quite clear , though , as it is determined by the perturbative expansion ( [ sigma_qu1_expansion ] ) .    in what follows we are going to regulate the uv divergences with dimensional regularization where the number of worldvolume dimensions @xmath10 is regarded as a variable parameter .",
    "since the divergent terms in ( [ sigma_qu_22 ] ) are isolated , the treatment that is involved is essentially the same as appeared when we considered the analytic kink solution .",
    "we choose to express our result in terms of the physical parameter @xmath78 defined by ( [ renorm_condition ] ) .",

    "consecutively , the 2-dimensional fluctuation operator @xmath93 has continuous spectra extending down to zero . in principle",
    "one should go back to the original functional integral and use standard collective coordinate procedures @xcite to separate the translational mode .",
    "however , the zero mode of @xmath41 merely causes the two - dimensional functional determinant appearing in ( [ sigma_qu3 ] ) to have an integrable logarithmic singularity at @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , we do not need to modify ( [ sigma_qu3 ] ) for the computation of the one - loop kink mass .    to proceed further",

    "the crucial observation is that for the theory at hand , the effective potential acquires a @xmath125 term which comes from the summation of all one - loop gauge field diagrams with an arbitrary number of insertions of @xmath126 .",
    "the existence of two degenerate minima of the effective potential hence implies that the effective potential acquires the form of a double well , @xmath127 where @xmath15 is the expectation value of @xmath120 in the higgs phase .",
