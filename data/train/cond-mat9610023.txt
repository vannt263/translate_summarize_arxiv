    "there has been considerable interest in recent years in using scanning probe microscopy to investigate the surfaces of transition metal oxides .",
    "these materials , frequently used in technological applications in which surface properties are crucial , are obvious candidates for study by methods which potentially offer atomic resolution ; even a low - index `` clean '' surface may undergo considerable structural relaxation , and may have its electronic and structural properties dominated by localised ( o - vacancy ) defects . for the semiconducting oxides , such as rutile tio@xmath0 and sno@xmath0 , scanning _ tunnelling",
    "_ microscopy ( stm ) may be used .",
    "the aim of our work is to use computational modelling to aid understanding of atomic resolution stm experiments at oxide surfaces using tio@xmath0 ( 110 ) in particular as a model surface .",
    "at least three groups have published atomic resolution images at this surface  @xcite , whose structure appears to be heavily influenced by local stoichiometry .",
    "issues to be addressed include identification of the atoms responsible for features seen in positive - bias images , and the extent to which we expect stm to distinguish between the various structural models proposed for the surface .    unfortunately , the problems associated with modelling the full stm experiment are considerable .",
    "the breaking of translational symmetry caused even by a simple bulk - terminated surface make quantitative atom - based calculations very compute expensive .",
    "the addition of a scanning tip , not even periodic in the plane of the surface , and its associated electric fields , compounds the problem , as does the extension to systems with reconstructions , defects and adsorbates .",
    "perhaps the most successful computational methods for modelling surfaces are those based on _ ab initio _ plane - wave pseudopotential calculations .",
    "these have been performed for low - index tio@xmath0 surfaces  @xcite .",
    "their principal drawback is that atomic oxygen is particularly difficult to pseudise , due to the lack of core @xmath2 orbitals .",
    "the same problem occurs for the first - row transition elements , lacking a core @xmath1 orbital .",
    "pseudopotential calculations involving these atoms are therefore rather expensive .",
    "we are engaged in a programme of research using less rigorous , but far cheaper , computational methods to model transition metal oxides .",
    "the ability of our method to reproduce a reasonable account of the physics of these surfaces has been investigated through a series of benchmarking exercises , reported elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "though the results presented here are for relatively simple , isolated surfaces , we feel they already make a contribution to the understanding of stm experiments at these surfaces .",
    "further , we are confident that it will be possible to model realistic systems , including tips , on a moderate workstation .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section 2 contains a brief outline of the computational method employed . in section 3",
    "we present calculated densities of states ( dos ) for bulk rutile tio@xmath0 , from which it might be assumed that positive bias experiments only ever image ti atoms , and computed local - dos ( equivalent to the `` perfect tip '' approximation to stm imaging  @xcite ) which show that this is not necessarily the case .",
    "our conclusions are drawn in section 4 .",
    "the calculations were carried out in a first - principles atomic - orbital based scheme  @xcite .",
    "the basis set comprised the valence orbitals for ti ( 4@xmath4 , 4@xmath2 , and 3@xmath1 ) and o ( 2@xmath4 and 2@xmath2 ) .",
    "the numerical atomic orbitals were generated using a standard local - density approximation for exchange and correlation , and the potential in the solid was calculated by superposing neutral - atom charge densities .",
    "the schrdinger equation was then solved for the electronic structure of tio@xmath0 slabs with a thickness of 612 atomic layers ( sufficient to prevent substantial interaction between the two surfaces ) .",
    "self - consistency was included only to the extent that the energy of the ti 3@xmath1 state was made consistent with that in a neutral atom with the same @xmath1-occupancy ; this leads to an occupancy of 1.85 @xmath1 electrons per ti atom in bulk tio@xmath0 , with small variations from this value at the surface .",
    "the method has previously been used to study the electronic structure of various tio@xmath0 surfaces  @xcite .",
    "although this approach is crude compared to fully self - consistent calculations , the advantage of the method is its simplicity which allows it to be easily applied to the local electronic structure in complicated geometries such as defective tio@xmath0 surfaces .",
    "the calculated dos of bulk rutile tio@xmath0 is presented in figure  [ fig : dos ] .",
    "the total dos is resolved in terms of atomic ti and o contributions .",
    "tio@xmath0 is a direct - gap semiconducting material .",
    "our calculations yield a fundamental gap of 2.85  ev ; the experimental value is 3.0  ev  @xcite . the character of the valence band is mainly o 2@xmath2 , with rather less ti 3@xmath1 .",
    "the unoccupied , conduction band is formed by ti 3@xmath1 orbitals with a small contribution from o 2@xmath2 states .",
    "stm experiments with atomic resolution at tio@xmath0 surfaces are achieved with a positive tip bias  @xcite , which means the tunnelling occurs into empty conduction band states .",
    "because of the mainly ti 3@xmath1 character of these states , it is expected from the electronic point of view that ti atoms will be imaged . however , at the unrelaxed ( 100 ) and ( 110 ) surfaces , the uppermost o atoms are approximately 1  above the ti atoms . since the tails of the radial wavefunctions are decaying exponentially , the contribution of o atoms to the stm images may be appreciable because of this height difference .",
    "radial wavefunctions of the relevant o and ti atomic orbitals are shown in figure  [ fig : dos](b ) . in ( c )",
    "the wavefunctions are re - plotted to give an approximate indication of the interplay between electronic structure and geometry .",
    "the o wavefunctions are shifted 1  to the right of those of ti to take into account the height difference and are scaled by 0.1 since the o contribution to the dos is @xmath510% of the ti contribution for the conduction band states shown .",
    "this plot would suggest that both o and ti may contribute to constant height images , with o dominating out to @xmath53  and ti further out .",
    "this simple analysis agrees well with the computed constant height ( @xmath6 ) charge densities @xmath7 , shown in figure  [ fig : surf100 ] for the unrelaxed , stoichiometric tio@xmath0 ( 100)@xmath8 surface .",
    "the charge densities consist of the sum of all states at @xmath9 within 1.5ev of the conduction band edge . assuming the fermi level is pinned at or close to the conduction band edge , this figure represents the crudest , perfect delta - function tip , estimate of a constant - height stm image at + 1.5v bias . at the smallest height @xmath10   ( measured from the uppermost surface o )",
    "@xmath7 shows a peak close to the surface o atom position , as seen in figure  [ fig : surf100](b ) . at @xmath11  @xmath7",
    "is more uniform along the 001 direction .",
    "further away from the surface at @xmath12  a peak appears close to the ti atom positions ( figure  [ fig : surf100]d ) . by 6",
    "our calculations suggest that lateral structure has all but disappeared . this may give a qualitative explanation as to why the @xmath8 surface has never been imaged with atomic resolution in stm .",
    "atomically resolved stm images have been reported both for the @xmath8 and @xmath13 phases of tio@xmath0 ( 110 )  @xcite .",
    "one of the proposed models for the @xmath13 surface is a missing row reconstruction , in which every second bridging o row is removed ( figure  [ fig : surf110]a ) .",
    "this reduction results in a surface state just below the bottom of the conduction band .",
    "computed constant - height charge densities @xmath7 for the unrelaxed @xmath8 and unrelaxed missing row @xmath13 surfaces are shown in figure  [ fig : surf110 ] at heights of 2  and 4 .",
    "again , only states at @xmath9 within 1.5ev of the conduction band edge have been included .",
    "two surface units cells of the @xmath8 surface are plotted for easy comparison with the @xmath13 surface . at 2",
    "the charge comes mainly from a state having the character of o 2@xmath2 and two ti 3@xmath1 orbitals .",
    "the mixing of all these results in a peak over the bridging o atom .",
    "thus the difference between the @xmath14 ( b ) and @xmath13 ( c ) plots is merely that half the bridging oxygens are missing in the latter .    at @xmath12",
    "the charge density has switched , as in the ( 100 ) case , to being associated in position with surface ti atoms  @xcite , though there is little to suggest much resolution of individual atoms within rows lying along the [ 001 ] direction . at the @xmath8 surface",
    ", the rows are centred over the fivefold - coordinated ti atoms which sit halfway between the rows of bridging oxygen atoms . at the @xmath13 surface",
    ", there is a single , much wider row , centred over the fourfold - coordinated ti atoms exposed on the removal of the o rows . these results , including the relative register of the main features in the two phases , are in broad agreement with experimental stm images of tio@xmath0 ( 110 ) .",
    "we have presented the results of computationally cheap atomic - orbital based calculations at low - index tio@xmath0 surfaces which show broad agreement with published experimental stm images . despite the problems inherent to any attempt to model stm , we are encouraged that even the simplest calculations of charge density at the surfaces of tio@xmath0 yield results which make sense in terms of published stm images and yield information , relating to orbital content of observed features , which may be of use in interpretation . the constant height charge densities @xmath7 at tio@xmath0 surfaces are affected by both geometrical structure , as the surface oxygen atoms sit @xmath5 1  above the next plane , and electronic structure , in that the conduction band is mainly formed by ti 3d orbitals but mixing of orbitals shift the peak positions .",
    "the next stage at the tio@xmath0(110)@xmath13 surface is to investigate the sensitivity of the computed charge densities ( integrated over the surface brillouin zone ) to the geometry of various proposed structures .",
    "the inclusion of a tip , and consideration of other oxide surfaces are obvious extensions on which we are currently working ."
