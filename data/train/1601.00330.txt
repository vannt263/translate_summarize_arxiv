    "the number of known gamma - ray pulsars has grown rapidly since the fermi large area telescope ( lat ) started taking data in august 2008 . at present 205 gamma - ray pulsars",
    "are identified , including 112 non - recycled pulsars .",
    "the latter includes 61 radio - loud pulsars and 51 radio - quiet ones , see  @xcite for a review . with the only exception of geminga  @xcite , the detection of the radio - quiet pulsars became possible only with the sensitivity of fermi - lat .",
    "high - performance numerical methods were designed and implemented based on the time - differencing technique  @xcite .    with the statistics in hands",
    "one may raise questions on the model of the gamma - ray emission and corresponding mechanism of the radio - quietness .",
    "two general classes of the pulsar gamma - ray emission models are discussed .",
    "the first class includes the so - called polar cap ( pc ) models  @xcite . in these models",
    "gamma rays are produced by electrons and positrons accelerated in the polar cap region near the surface of the neutron star . in the pc models",
    "the gamma - ray and radio beams are generally co - aligned .",
    "the latter is considered narrower than the former and therefore some of the pulsars are observed as radio - quiet  @xcite . moreover , in the pc models the fraction of the radio - quiet pulsars depends on the pulsar s age  @xcite . in the second class of models",
    "the gamma - ray emission is produced in the outer magnetosphere ( om ) of the pulsar  @xcite . in the om models",
    "the radio - quietness finds a geometrical description as the gamma - ray and radio - beams orientations are naturally diverse .",
    "moreover , beam geometry within the om models may serve as a consistent description of recent chandra and xmm - newton observations of gamma - ray pulsars  @xcite .",
    "the latter showed that on average radio - quiet pulsars have higher gamma - ray - to - x - ray flux ratio than radio - loud ones .",
    "it was noted that the observed fraction of the radio - quiet objects is relatively small for young pulsars  @xcite .",
    "this observation may be interpreted in terms of evolution of the radio - beam solid angle  @xcite .",
    "alternatively this may be an effect of the observational selection bias  @xcite . while radio - quiet pulsars are discovered in a blind search with gamma - ray data ,",
    "there are multiple ways to find radio - loud pulsars .",
    "the latter may be found either in radio surveys or with follow - up observations of gamma - ray sources . in most cases",
    "the gamma - ray pulsations of radio - loud pulsars are found with ephemerides from radio observations .",
    "nevertheless there are pulsars with pulsed radio - emission detected following the gamma - ray pulsations .    in this _ paper _ we construct a less biased catalog of the gamma - ray selected pulsars by performing a blind search for gamma - ray pulsars using the fermi lat data alone .",
    "the search is more extensive with respect to our preceding blind search  @xcite . with the novel efficient semi - coherent method a complete range of characteristic ages starting from 1 kyr is covered .",
    "no radio or optical observation data are used .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "fermi - lat data selection and preparation procedures are explained in section  [ sec : data ] .",
    "the implementation details of the semi - coherent method are given in section  [ sec : method ] .",
    "the catalog of the gamma - ray selected pulsars , comparison of radio - quiet and radio - loud gamma - ray pulsar populations and comparison of the results to the predictions of the pulsar emission models are presented in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "the paper is based on publicly - available weekly all - sky fermi - lat data for the time period from 2008 august 4 till 2015 march 3 ( mission elapsed time from 239557418 to 447055673 ) @xcite .",
    "we select source class events from reprocessed pass 7 data set with energies from 100  mev to 300  gev .",
    "the standard quality cuts are applied using the _ fermi science tools v9r32p5 _ package .",
    "these include @xmath2 and @xmath3 upper constraints for zenith angle and satellite rocking angle , respectively .",
    "we search for pulsations using the location of each of 3008 point sources from the fermi lat 4-year point source catalog ( 3fgl )  @xcite .",
    "the requirement of blindness to everything except gamma - ray emission binds us to the coordinates from the 3fgl catalog .",
    "although the precision of the gamma - ray source positioning is one of the factors limiting sensitivity of the scan  @xcite we did not scan over the sky location due to computational complexity .",
    "this has an effect on the sensitivity of the method to the pulsars with the frequency higher than @xmath4hz as shown by  @xcite .    a model of the @xmath5 radius circle sky patch",
    "is constructed for each of the candidates .",
    "the model includes galactic and isotropic diffuse emission components and all 3fgl sources within @xmath5 from the position of interest .",
    "we optimize the parameters of the model with unbinned likelihood analysis by the _",
    "gtlike _ tool .",
    "normalization of the galactic and isotropic diffuse emissions and spectral parameters of the target source were considered as free parameters , while the spectral parameters of all neighboring sources were fixed at the 3fgl values .",
    "the spectral form for each source is power - law , log - parabola or power - law with exponential cutoff based on the 3fgl data .",
    "next , using the _ gtsrcprob _ tool each photon is assigned a weight - probability to originate from the given pulsar candidate . for computational efficiency",
    "we keep 40000 events with the highest weights for each source .",
    "finally , the photon arrival times are converted to barycentric frame using the _ gtbary _ tool .",
    "the search for pulsations is performed with the time - differencing technique first proposed by @xcite and subsequently refined by @xcite .",
    "we scan over the pulsar s frequency @xmath6 and spin - down rate @xmath7 using the array of barycentric photon arrival times @xmath8 and corresponding weights @xmath9 .",
    "first , the arrival times are corrected to compensate for frequency evolution @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( mjd 55225 ) is a reference epoch . the spectral density @xmath13 is obtained with a fourier transform of the time differences    @xmath14    where @xmath15",
    ", @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the rectangular function which takes the value of 1 for @xmath19 and 0 otherwise .",
    "technically we consider only positive time differences and bin the time interval @xmath20 into @xmath21 bins . within the cycle over all event pairs",
    "one calculates the sum of product of weights @xmath22 in each bin .",
    "this prepares an input for the fast fourier transform performed with the open source library _ fftw _  @xcite .",
    "we use the same value of @xmath23 as @xcite .",
    "the nyquist frequency is @xmath24 which determines a choice of @xmath25 .",
    "the relatively high value of the nyquist frequency is required to minimize the artificial binning noise keeping in mind that some pulsars may be found at the second harmonic of the frequency .",
    "we scan over the parameter @xmath26 from @xmath27 to @xmath28 with a step equal to @xmath29 .",
    "the range corresponds to the pulsar characteristic age greater than @xmath30kyr .",
    "the step is selected taking into account the computation time available for the project .",
    "the value used introduces moderate loss of power for pulsations with frequencies higher than @xmath31  hz , see eq .  3 of @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 corresponding to the highest @xmath13 are used as a starting point for the final coherent scan .",
    "the latter is performed with maximization of the weighed @xmath32-test statistic  @xcite defined as follows :    @xmath33\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath34 is a fourier amplitude of the @xmath35-th harmonic @xmath36    the maximization is performed by a scan over @xmath6 and @xmath26 with the steps of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the steps are chosen to ensure the coherence over the whole observation time interval .",
    "we take into account that a combination of the pulsar s frequency and an inverse fermi orbital period @xmath39 may be found at the semi - coherent stage . therefore , the @xmath32-test is repeated three times starting from @xmath6 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    in this work",
    "an extensive scanning is performed and therefore a theoretical distribution of @xmath32-test statistic for the null hypothesis of non - pulsating object may not be used directly .",
    "we estimate the @xmath32 distribution using the results of the scan for the 1720 3fgl objects identified as blazars , see fig .",
    "[ histo ] .",
    "we extrapolate the tail of the distribution with the exponential function and require that the probability to have a single false candidate in the whole scan is less than @xmath42 .",
    "thus we arrive to the threshold value @xmath43 . unlike the rest of the work here we used identification information to select blazars from all the sources .",
    "we note that this does not affect detection uniformity since the same @xmath44 is then used for all sources .",
    "moreover , the procedure stays conservative in case of pulsar contamination in the blazars sample . in this case",
    "the @xmath44 would be overestimated and the probability of the false candidate appearance even less than required .",
