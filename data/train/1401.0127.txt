    "the dynamics of a large diversity of physicochemcal systems can be mathematically modeled as reaction - diffusion systems in which it is described how the composition of multiple chemical species distributed in space change under the influence of competitive chemical reactions between the species ( giving origin to a new species ) and the diffusion which causes the species to spread out in the space .",
    "it is well known that depending on the relative importance of the kinetics and the diffusion these systems can provide a large diversity of behaviors , including the formation of complex structures and patterns see @xcite .",
    "such a structure formation occurs for example during the solid phase formation and evolution in intercalation and conversion reactions in rechargeable lithium batteries @xcite , during the self - organisation of materials occuring with the fabrication process of composite electrodes for electrochemical devices applications @xcite , during the microstructural evolution of composite elecrodes upon their degradation @xcite and in other competitive chemically reactive systems like in the belousov - zhabotinsky reaction @xcite .",
    "+ designing appropriate controllers of these reaction - diffusion systems can reveal of great relevance within a reverse engineering approach for example towards the optimization of discharge - charge of lithium batteries ( by for example enhancing the formation of solid phases during discharge more reversible upon charge ) and the optimization of the structure of the fabricated electrodes as function of the fabrication parameters ( e.g. temperature dynamics , reactant flow , etc . ) .",
    "+ in this paper , we consider the one - dimensional allen - cahn equation @xmath00,1 [ , t > 0,\\\\ u_x(0,t)=\\alpha(t ) , u_x(1,t)=0 & \\forall t > 0,\\\\ u(x,0)=u_0(x ) & x\\in ] 0,1[.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] + this reaction - diffusion equation describes the process of phase separation in many situations .",
    "it was originally introduced in @xcite by allen and cahn to model the motion of anti - phase boundaries in crystalline solids . in equation",
    "( 1 ) , @xmath1 represents the concentration of one of the possible phases , @xmath2 represents the interfacial width , supposed to be small as compared to the characteristic length of the laboratory scale . the homogenous neumann boundary condition ( when @xmath3 ) traduces that there is no loss of mass across the boundary walls",
    "however , the allen - cahn equation is invoqued in a large number of complicated moving interface problems in materials science through a phase - field approach , therefore a large litterature in mathematical analysis and in numerical analysis is devoted to the study of the mathematical properties of this equation and of its simulation ( see @xcite and the references therein ) . +",
    "in equation ( 1 ) , @xmath4 represents the potential energy and @xmath5 represents the control flux at one of the boundaries ; @xmath4 is assumed having stable roots @xmath6 , @xmath7 such that @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "it is observed in many cases that when @xmath10 and as @xmath11 goes to @xmath12 , the solutions tend to steady states @xmath13 which consist in ( almost ) piecewise constant functions whose the different values are equal to the stable roots of @xmath14 which represent the different phase stripes .",
    "hence @xmath13 exhibits large gradient near @xmath6 , as illustrated in figure ( [ fig1 ] ) .",

    ", we consider as control function @xmath5 , @xmath2 being constant .    for the sake of simplicity , we first restrict ourselves to the case @xmath18 which possesses 3 roots : @xmath19 which are stable and @xmath20 which is unstable .",
    "+ the article is organized as follows : first , in section 2 , we present first the global numerical strategy by deriving the estimation of the number of interphases , which will be the merit function to minimize . then , we present the finite differences discretization of the system in space and we describe the numerical solver , that includes the optimization process as well as the full discretized problem to be solved at each iteration . in section 3 , we present some numerical results demonstrating the numerical controllability of the problem : we calculate optimal@xmath21 for different values of @xmath22 , @xmath17 and @xmath2 .",
    "finally , in section 4 we conclude and indicate further perspectives of development of our work .",
    "we consider the finite differences discretization in space of the allen - cahn equation which leads to a differential system .",
    "the grid points @xmath23 , @xmath24 are regularly spaced for simplicity , @xmath25 is the corresponding stepsize .",
    "we assume that @xmath25 is small enough in order the discrete solution captures the strong gradients near the interphases .",
    "the steady solution @xmath13 is considered to be almost piecewise constant , so its approximations at grid points @xmath26 , @xmath24 take the values @xmath27 .",
    "hence @xmath28 therefore , the number of interphases is @xmath29 this quantity can be related to the @xmath30-norm of @xmath31 , indeed @xmath32 in figure ( [ fig1 ] ) ( left ) , we count 10 changes , the result given by formula ( [ formula_changes ] ) is 9.9968 and in figure ( [ fig1 ] ) ( right ) 48 changes are counted while ( [ formula_changes ] ) estimation is 47.7475 . +",
    "we remark that an interesting numerical issue could be to plug an adaptive grid strategy since the steady solution needs only few points to be represented .",
    "our approach applies when more than 2 interphases are present .",
    "indeed , consider for simplicity the case of @xmath33 stable phases . to obtain the number of interphases , it is sufficient to split the final signal profile into 4 parts , each of them reprensenting the state of one phase stirp ( see figure below in the case of @xmath34 ) .",
    "once done , we can apply formula ( [ formula_changes ] ) separately .",
    "this procedure allows using a weighted merit function @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the number of connex components for phase @xmath37 and @xmath38 the associated weight : a large value of @xmath39 enforces the optimal state to provide small number of phases of type @xmath37 .",
    "so it is possible to select a given profile .",
    "it has to be pointed out that @xmath40 , the total number of interphases , in fact @xmath41 , however the simplified summation formula allows selecting easily given phase stripes ( figure ( [ fig3 ] ) )",

    "we denote by @xmath50 the approximation of @xmath51 generated by the semi discrete scheme @xmath52 in which we have implemented neumann boundary condition to calculate the values @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    as a time marching scheme",
    ", we will use a semi implicit one , in order to have a good stability : it is important since , as we will see hereafter , the calculation of optimal @xmath5 requires a great number of numerical solutions of this system and a not too small time step @xmath55 must be used .",
    "we fix a value for the final time @xmath17 , @xmath17 being large enough to obtain a steady state : in practice the solution converges toward equilibrium relatively fastly for small values of @xmath2 , which is the case here .",

    ", the principal key of this approach is the choice of the optimization method to compute @xmath5 .",
    "this is not an easy task since the merit function is not differentiable in the @xmath30 case ; generally the gradient is not available as in the @xmath48 case .",
    "hence , gradient methods can not be used .",
    "we have then to address to derivative free optimization algorithms @xcite . + in order to illutrate the numerical cacutation of optimal @xmath21 , we use matlab build - in house solver , such as x = fminsearch(fun , x0 ) or x = fminunc(fun , x0 ) where fun is the objective function which in our case is built numerically by solving the allen  cahn equation up to @xmath102 with @xmath21 as an input .",
