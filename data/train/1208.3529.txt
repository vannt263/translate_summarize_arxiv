    "through detailed photometry of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) undertaken with the hubble and spitzer space telescopes , much has been learned regarding the physical properties of galaxies beyond a redshift @xmath93 .",
    "stellar masses and star formation rates have now been inferred from broadband photometric spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for thousands of galaxies spanning the redshift range @xmath10 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the stellar mass density derived from these studies",
    "has proven a useful integrated constraint on the contribution of galaxies to reionization ( e.g. , @xcite ) , while the evolution of physical properties has provided insight into the processes which govern the assembly of early galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a potentially significant puzzle has recently emerged from these studies through measurement of the specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) at @xmath11 .",
    "current observations demonstrate that between @xmath8 and @xmath12 , the ssfr in galaxies of fixed stellar mass does not evolve strongly ( e.g. , @xcite ) , with recent estimates indicating at most a factor of two increase between @xmath8 and 7 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is in contrast to simple expectations from semi - analytic models and numerical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) which predict that the ssfr should closely match the inflow rate of baryonic material .",
    "as this mass inflow rate is thought to increase with redshift as @xmath13 @xcite , we should expect nearly a 10@xmath7 increase in ssfr in galaxies of fixed stellar mass over @xmath14 , in marked contrast to the observations .",
    "the physical cause of the discrepancy associated with the ssfr evolution remains unclear .",
    "as discussed previously ( e.g. , @xcite ) , a plateau in the redshift dependence of the ssfr would suggest star formation is more inefficient at @xmath15 than at @xmath8 .",
    "various physical processes might be invoked to impede star formation , such as the inefficient formation of molecular hydrogen in low metallicity galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) or an increase in the efficiency with which cold gas is removed via large - scale outflows .",
    "irrespective of any mechanism that might inhibit star formation at early times , it is difficult to reconcile such an inefficiency with the notion that early galaxies provide the ionizing photons responsible for reionization @xcite .",
    "for example , the steep faint end slope of the ultraviolet luminosity function ( uv lf ) at @xmath15 @xcite implies that star formation in low mass dark matter halos becomes _ more efficient _ at earlier times ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in contrast to the implications of the ssfr measurements .    given these difficulties , it is prudent that we reconsider the accuracy of the data that is used to infer the ssfr and its evolution .",
    "the two basic ingredients are the star formation rates and the stellar masses .",
    "the @xmath6 measurements have indeed changed since the original articles ( e.g. , @xcite ) , mostly as a result of improved dust corrections following improved near - infrared photometry ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the new dust corrections have served to increase the @xmath16 ssfr measurements by a factor @xmath17 2 . however , since negligible extinction is inferred at @xmath5 , the ssfr still remains constant over @xmath18 @xcite although a factor of 2 higher than at @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "a potentially more important problem is the possible contribution of rest - frame optical nebular emission lines ( e.g. , [ o ii ] , [ o iii ] , h@xmath2 ) to the broad - band fluxes used to infer the stellar masses .",
    "such emission lines , could significantly affect the inferred amplitude of a balmer break , leading to an overestimate of the stellar mass and thereby an underestimate of the ssfr .",
    "figure 1 illustrates how the various nebular emission lines contaminate the key photometric filters as a function of redshift . beyond @xmath16 ,",
    "the key filters of interest in the determination of stellar masses are the _",
    "spitzer_/irac warm bands at 3.6@xmath3 m and 4.5@xmath3 m .",
    "it is particularly striking that , at @xmath20 , the strongest rest - frame optical nebular lines ( [ oiii]@xmath21 and h@xmath2 ) contaminate both _ spitzer_/irac filters .",
    "although many @xmath20 galaxies are detected with _ spitzer _",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ) , contamination by nebular emission could significantly affect the interpretation of their seds .",
    "accounting for nebular emission in the seds of high redshift galaxies has been considered by several earlier works ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in general terms , their approach has been to use ` forward modeling ' techniques based on adding nebular emission contributions to stellar population synthesis models in order to demonstrate the possible implications of its inclusion .",
    "however , such ",
    "nebular+stellar \" model fits can not provide a precise unambiguous measure of nebular contamination for several reasons .",
    "firstly , there are numerous uncertainties in how the contribution of nebular emission should be added .",
    "these include the nebular extinction law and ionizing photon escape fraction .",
    "secondly , for galaxies at @xmath22 , for which there is no uncontaminated measure of the stellar continuum ( figure 1 ) , the uncertainties are particularly large . finally , and perhaps most importantly , without a spectroscopic redshift , addressing both the nebular contamination and the photometric redshift of the galaxy from the same photometric data leads to great uncertainties",
    "; there is no _ a priori _ indication of which photometric bands are contaminated by nebular emission .",
    "fortunately , by virtue of our deep keck spectroscopic survey ( stark et al .",
    "2010 , stark et al .",
    "2011 , jones et al .",
    "2012 , schenker et al . 2012 ) and our nebular+stellar population synthesis code ( robertson et al . 2010 ) , we can use the availability of hst - spitzer seds to make progress in addressing this issue .",
    "while the question of contamination by nebular emission at @xmath22 must await the infrared spectroscopic capabilities of james webb space telescope , we can test our spectroscopic range @xmath1 for contamination by h@xmath2 in the _",

    "our approach follows that of @xcite who demonstrated that galaxies in this redshift window are typically significantly brighter at 3.6@xmath3 m than at 4.5@xmath3 m . by comparing their flux density at 3.6@xmath3 m to that expected from stellar continuum alone",

    "equipped with this external constraint on the strength of nebular emission , we can then determine how stellar masses and the ssfr of @xmath6 galaxies are likely to be altered by emission line contamination . in particular , we will explore whether our estimated degree of nebular contamination could be sufficient at the highest redshifts to permit a rapid rise in the redshift - dependent ssfr as expected from theoretical models .    the present paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we discuss the selection of the spectroscopic sample used in our analysis . in  3",

    "the spectroscopic sample is drawn from earlier papers @xcite .",
    "full details can be found in these articles , but we offer the reader a brief summary here .",
    "spectroscopy of @xmath0 lbgs in the two goods fields was undertaken at the keck observatory using the deimos spectrograph @xcite . as discussed in @xcite",
    ", lbgs were selected using standard ` dropout ' criteria ( e.g. , @xcite ) to a limiting magnitude of @xmath27 using the goods v2 public photometric catalogs ( e.g. , @xcite ) . taking advantage of a similar spectroscopic campaign undertaken using the fors2 in goods - south ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we retrospectively constructed a vlt sample using the same photometric criteria .",
    "the combined keck plus vlt survey comprises 157 galaxies in the redshift range @xmath1 which satisfy the dropout criteria .",
    "as we will discuss below , only a subset of these will be used in our analysis .",
    "a key requirement for the derivation of stellar masses and specific star formation rate is precise broad band photometry from which seds for galaxies of known spectroscopic redshifts can be determined . in goods - south",
    ", we use the public release of the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) imaging from the candels multi - cycle treasury program @xcite and our own reduction ( see @xcite ) of the early release science ( ers ) campaign ( e.g. , windhorst et al . 2011 ) .",
    "colors were computed with respect to the z@xmath28 flux using matched apertures with up - to - date zero points , and total wfc3 magnitudes were derived by combining the measured colours with the total z@xmath28-band flux .",
    "k@xmath29-band photometry is taken from deep isaac imaging @xcite following the procedure discussed in @xcite .",
    "for goods - n , we use near - infrared imaging obtained from cfht / wircam @xcite .",
    "the rest - frame optical at @xmath6 is probed by the deep _ spitzer_/irac ( fazio et al .",
    "2004 ) imaging of goods - s and goods - n ( dickinson et al . 2012 , in prep ) .",
    "in particular , the 3.6@xmath3 m ( hereafter [ 3.6 ] ) and 4.5@xmath3 m ( hereafter [ 4.5 ] ) are the most useful , as the longer wavelength filters are typically not sensitive enough to detect most @xmath6 galaxies . as in stark et al ( 2009 ) ,",
    "we focus primarily on the subset of acs - selected galaxies whose irac fluxes are not contaminated significantly by neighboring sources .",
    "the irac magnitudes are measured in apertures 2.4 arcsec in diameter and to account for flux falling outside this aperture , we apply a 0.7 mag aperture correction derived from a sample of isolated point sources . recognizing that selecting only isolated irac sources limits the size of our eventual sample , we included irac flux measurements for galaxies in goods - south from the music catalog @xcite .",
    "these fluxes rely on a deconfusion procedure to extract fluxes from sources with contaminating neighbors .",
    "a comparison between the two photometry methods reveals consistency for our isolated sample , with a standard deviation of 0.19 mags and no systematic offset .    in total",
    ", we have 92 galaxies in the range @xmath1 with measured irac photometry . in our analysis",
    ", we will focus on the subset of 45 galaxies with confident ( @xmath305@xmath31 ) 4.5@xmath3 m detections ( see table 1 ) , as without an accurate measure of the 4.5@xmath3 m flux it is impossible to infer the expected stellar continuum from population synthesis models .",
    "the objects with deconfused goods music photometry make up 60% of the final sample .",
    "some caution must be exercised when applying inferences from a spectroscopic sample to the parent photometric population . in attempting to infer the typical level of rest - optical nebular contamination",
    ", we must be particularly careful that we do not bias our sample toward strong ly@xmath2 emitting galaxies , a population which might have larger than average ssfr and h@xmath2 ew .",
    "for faint galaxies ( @xmath32 ) , the spectroscopic sample of stark et al .",
    "( 2010 ) is indeed biased toward ly@xmath2 emitters .",
    "but by requiring a 5@xmath31 detection in the [ 4.5 ] band , we limit our sample to brighter systems ( average @xmath33-band magnitude of 25.0 ) for which we are more complete spectroscopically . indeed the percentage of galaxies for which we measure ly@xmath2 in emission is actually only 46% , highlighting the fact that many galaxies in this bright subset are instead confirmed via the combination of ly@xmath2 in absorption and metal absorption lines ( e.g. , jones et al . 2012 ) .",
    "furthermore , the fraction of galaxies in this subset with strong ( @xmath34   ) ly@xmath2 emission ( 5% ) is similar to that measured for galaxies in this m@xmath35 and redshift range ( 6% in stark et al .",
    "2010 ) adding confidence that the sample we use in this paper is not likely to be strongly biased toward nebular emitters and appears fairly representative of the photometric population .",
    "our goal is to quantify the nebular contribution through analysis of the seds of a large spectroscopic sample at @xmath1 .",
    "the advantage of our technique is that , for these sources , we can predict the exact wavelengths of rest - frame optical emission lines and thereby remove ambiguities associated with determining the photometric redshift simultaneously from contaminated broadband photometry .",
    "previous attempts to assess the impact of nebular emission on broadband photometry have utilized models which include the contributions from both nebular and stellar emission . for the reasons outlined in",
    " 1 , our analysis will focus instead on models containing only stellar continuum .",
    "the stellar continuum predictions are based on the models of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) and the technique we will adopt is mostly similar to that described in detail in stark et al ( 2009 ) .",
    "however , we also investigate how including nebular emission affects the derived physical properties .",
    "to do so , we make use of the code described in @xcite to which the interested reader is referred . in this code ,",
    "line emission is calculated from the number of ionizing photons per second , which is provided as output from our population synthesis models .    in the robertson et al .",
    "( 2010 ) code , the intensities of hydrogen lines are computed from the values tabulated in osterbrock & ferland ( 2006 ) , assuming case b recombination . we compute the intensities of the lines of common metallic species from the empirical results of anders et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , assuming a gas phase metallicity of @xmath36 , similar to that measured for galaxies at these redshifts ( maiolino et al . 2008 , jones et al .",
    "the recombination line luminosities are calculated assuming that the ionising photon escape fraction , f@xmath37 , is 0.2 ( see shapley et al .",
    "2011 for a discussion of expected escape fractions ) .",
    "since we do not rely on the nebular models for our primary conclusions , this assumption does not affect our results .",
    "the continuum contribution from bound - free , free - free , and two photon continuum emission is also calculated following osterbrock & ferland ( 2006 ) .",
    "the full nebular template is then added to each stellar continuum model , which is then used to calculate the synthetic fluxes used in our sed fitting code .",
    "since our sample has the virtue of precise spectroscopic redshifts , we do not fit the photometric bands spanning the ly@xmath2 forest and ly@xmath2 emission lines , both of which vary significantly from source to source at any given redshift .",
    "for the redshift range which we are primarily interested in ( @xmath1 ) , this leaves 7 - 8 ( largely ) independent photometric constraints on the sed in goods - s and 6 constraints on goods - n . for consistency with the earlier literature",
    ", we consider a salpeter ( 1955 ) initial mass function with 0.1 - 100 m@xmath38 .",
    "given the relatively small number of constraints on the sed , we utilize a moderately restricted grid , varying only the age , dust reddening , and normalization factor .",
    "we fix the star formation history as either constant or rising with time following the t@xmath39 power law inferred in papovich et al .",
    "this restricted grid of sfh is supported by the results of reddy et al .",
    "( 2012 ) that demonstrate that at @xmath8 , the star formation rates inferred from exponentially - declining star formation history models do not agree with those measured from the observed ir and uv fluxes .",
    "nevertheless we have verified that our results would not be affected if we had adopted exponential decay models .",
    "finally we utilize sub - solar metallicity ( z=0.2  z@xmath38 ) motivated by the observations discussed above .",
    "we allow the differential extinction , e(b - v)@xmath40 , to range between 0.00 and 0.50 in steps of 0.02 , and we limit the model ages to lie between 5 myr and the age of the universe at the redshift of interest .",
    "the precise form of the dust attenuation curve is , of course , not known at @xmath6 , but we consider the reddening law appropriate for local starbursts ( e.g.,meurer et al .",
    "1999 , calzetti et al .",
    "2000 ) and a steeper attenuation curve that is appropriate for the smc ( e.g.,gordon & clayton 1998 ) .",
    "the latter appears to be appropriate for young galaxies ( @xmath41100 myr ) at high redshift ( siana et al .",
    "2008 , reddy et al .",
    "2010 , 2012 ) , a population which might become increasingly dominant at @xmath6 .",
    "the relative extinction provided to stars and nebular emission is not definitively understood at high redshift .",
    "expectations from nearby galaxies suggest that the nebular gas is preferentially more extincted than the stellar continuum , as expected if the hii regions lie in dustier regions than the stars contributing to the integrated stellar continuum .",
    "based on observations of local star - forming galaxies and starbursts , calzetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) suggest that @xmath42 = a@xmath43 . whether or not this relationship holds at high redshift is unclear .",
    "some of the first studies of h@xmath2 emission in star forming galaxies @xmath8 indicated that the nebular gas and stars might be equally attenuated ( e.g. , erb et al .",
    "2006 , reddy et al .",
    "2010 ) . but",
    "more recently , new studies have emerged which support a factor @xmath44 higher extinction toward hii regions ( e.g. , forster - schreiber et al .",

    ". clearly an improved understanding of how the relative distribution of stars and hii regions depends on age and mass would greatly benefit attempts to simultaneously fit stellar and nebular emission via population synthesis models . in the nebular+stellar models presented in this paper",
    ", we will simply assume that a@xmath45 = a@xmath46 .    in the following",
    ", we will fit the data with both the nebular+stellar and stellar continuum models . for the latter , the cleanest method",
    "is obtained by fitting the data excluding the [ 3.6 ] flux measurement , given that this band could be contaminated by h@xmath2 . however , excluding this band means that only one filter is available to constrain the sed beyond the balmer break .",
    "we therefore also fit the data using all photometric information , i.e. including the [ 3.6 ] measurement .",
    "this is discussed further in  3.2 . for each galaxy , we compute the model age , normalization , and a@xmath47 which provide acceptable fits to the data .",
    "the normalization is then mapped to the star formation rate and stellar mass appropriate for the given template .",
    "we compute uncertainties on these parameters by bootstrap resampling the data within the allowed photometric uncertainties .",
    "we infer h@xmath2 emission line strengths in our sample of @xmath1 galaxies by comparing the observed flux density in the [ 3.6 ] bandpass to the flux density in that filter expected from stellar continuum alone .",
    "we explore the method which produces the most accurate equivalent widths below .",
    "to verify the reliability of using the broadband flux excesses to derive emission line strengths , we examine the seds of a moderate redshift sample of nebular line emitters with spectroscopically - measured [ oiii ] line fluxes from wfc3 grism observations of the hubble ultra deep field ( trump et al .",
    "we choose this sample rather than larger ground - based samples because use of 2d grism spectroscopy avoids uncertainties owing to slit losses . to characterize the contribution of the emission lines to the broadband seds , we measure optical through mid - ir photometry using the udf dataset ( see mclure et al .",
    "2011 for details ) and perform population synthesis modelling following exactly the same procedure as described above .",
    "[ oiii ] will either fall in the j@xmath48-band ( at @xmath49 ) or h@xmath50-band ( at @xmath51 ) .",
    "we characterize the likely strength of the emission lines by comparing the observed broadband flux ( in the contaminated filter ) to the stellar continuum flux expected from the best - fitting population synthesis models .",
    "we consider the stellar models with and without the contaminated bandpass included . in order to ensure a reliable measure of the stellar continuum in the vicinity of [ oiii ]",
    ", we do not consider galaxies with strong emission lines in adjacent infrared filters ( e.g. , [ oiii ] in h@xmath50 and h@xmath2 in k@xmath29 ) or those undetected in k@xmath29-band .",
    "we focus our analysis on the four systems in this remaining subset for which the measured [ oiii ] flux is predicted to make a significant ( e.g. , @xmath52% ) contribution to the broadband photometry . in each of these systems",
    ", the contaminated filter reveals an excess with respect to the best - fitting stellar continuum model ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the fluxes required to produce the broadband excesses in the contaminated filter agree well with those measured spectroscopically ( figure 2 ) , with the results from the two fitting methods typically bracketing the observed line flux . while both methods produce remarkably good agreement , the line fluxes are slightly more accurate ( average flux uncertainty of @xmath53% ) when the stellar continuum is estimated from the fit to the sed including the contaminated filter . when the contaminated filter is excluded from the fitting process , the inferred line flux is typically 1.5 - 2.0@xmath7 greater than measured with the wfc3 grism",
    ". given the seds are fairly poorly sampled in the wavelength range where the continuum flux is required , it is conceivable that by excluding the contaminated filter , the fitting process will prefer redder models which fit the flux in the adjacent filters but underpredict the continuum in vicinity of the emission line of interest .",
    "regardless of the precise reason , it is clear from fig .",
    "2 that by considering the results from both methods , fairly accurate line strengths can be extracted from the photometry .",
    "the results of this test therefore motivate use of the broadband flux excesses to infer line strengths in carefully - selected spectroscopic samples at higher redshifts where direct spectroscopic measurements of nebular line fluxes are not yet available . as a result of the higher redshifts ( and the corresponding @xmath54  boost in observed equivalent width ) , we expect the nebular line contribution to broadband fluxes to be greater than typically observed at intermediate redshifts ( e.g. , trump et al .",
    "2011 ) , allowing the flux excesses to more consistently stand out with respect to photometric uncertainties .",
    "based on the results in this section , we expect the the true line fluxes to be bracketed by our two fitting methods , with the most accurate measurements obtained by fits to the entire sed .",
    "we now discuss the results derived from applying our technique to the seds of spectroscopically - confirmed galaxies in the redshift range @xmath1 over which h@xmath2 may contaminate the irac 3.6@xmath3 m filter .",
    "we compare the observed [ 3.6 ] flux densities to the stellar continuum expected from population synthesis models and use the results to infer an empirically - based h@xmath2 equivalent width distribution (  4.1 ) .",
    "we discuss the possible redshift evolution of the nebular line strengths in  4.2 . using the empirically - derived equivalent width distributions ,",
    "we examine how nebular emission affects the derived physical properties of @xmath6 galaxies (  4.3 ) .",
    "we begin by comparing the [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] colour distribution for galaxies at @xmath1 with that for galaxies at @xmath4 ( a redshift range over which the irac colours are uncontaminated by strong nebular emission ) .",
    "this should reveal the impact of h@xmath2 emission on broadband fluxes at @xmath0 .",
    "we apply this test for 45 galaxies at @xmath1 with robust flux measurements in the 4.5@xmath3 m filter which constrains the rest - optical stellar continuum . the results ( figure 3 ) point to a significant contribution from h@xmath2 .",
    "the median [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] colour at @xmath1 is 0.33 mag bluer than the median value at @xmath4 , consistent with expectations if h@xmath2 pollutes the 3.6@xmath3 m filter in the higher redshift bin .",
    "note the slightly red [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] colors of the @xmath4 sample are exactly what is expected for moderately reddened ( @xmath55\\simeq 0.1 $ ] ) galaxies with a constant star formation history and luminosity - weighted ages of 100 myr .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnoff test demonstrates with confidence that these two color distributions are distinct ( ks statistic of d=0.54 with an associated probability by chance of 8@xmath710@xmath56 ) .",
    "we also consider whether the change in color might be due to photometric scatter from increased photometric error in the higher redshift bin .",
    "we test this by randomly perturbing the @xmath4 [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] colour distribution according to the irac flux errors of the @xmath1 sample .",
    "while this can slightly broaden the width of the colour distribution , it does not shift the median colour to bluer values as observed .    while the most natural interpretation of the systematic offset is the presence of h@xmath2 in the [ 3.6 ] filter ,",
    "it is conceivable that other effects could contribute .",
    "for example , one might expect that a systematic offset in [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] colours might arise from the slightly different rest - frame wavelengths sampled and the ( potentially ) younger ages in the higher redshift bin .",
    "examination of population synthesis models indicates that intrinsic galaxy evolution is not likely to dominate the shift in [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] colors .",
    "given the median reddening and ages inferred for the @xmath4 and @xmath1 spectroscopic samples , we would expect to see [ 3.6]-@xmath57 \\simeq 0.1 $ ] .",
    "this is similar to that observed at @xmath4 , but significantly redder than that observed in the @xmath1 redshift range with h@xmath2 contamination .",
    "we therefore conclude that nebular contamination is likely the dominant cause of the differences in the [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] colours .",
    "a particularly convincing verification of the above statistical test is the fact that we can directly see evidence of strong nebular emission in individual seds ( figure 4 ) .",
    "clearly in these examples the flux in the 3.6@xmath3 m filter is not only in excess of that at 4.5@xmath3 m but is also significantly in excess of the stellar continuum of the best - fitting population synthesis models .",
    "the seds of galaxies in this redshift range are ( not surprisingly ) typically better fit by models including nebular emission ( blue lines in bottom panel cf .",
    "red lines in top panel for stellar continuum models in figure 4 ) .",
    "to estimate the strength of h@xmath2 , we compute the amount by which the observed 3.6@xmath3 m flux exceeds the predicted stellar continuum flux .",
    "we define the 3.6@xmath3 m excess , @xmath58[3.6 ] as the difference between the [ 3.6 ] magnitude expected from stellar continuum models which fit the sed and the observed [ 3.6 ] magnitude .",
    "positive values indicate that the observed flux is greater than can be accommodated by stellar continuum .",
    "this test requires an accurate measure of the stellar continuum in the rest - optical .",
    "again we limit our sample to those galaxies with confident [ 4.5 ] detections , as this filter ( devoid of strong emission lines ) is necessary to anchor the population synthesis models beyond the balmer break .",
    "the distribution of 3.6@xmath3 m magnitude excesses in our spectroscopic sample ( figure 5 ) reveals that 96% of galaxies are observed to be brighter at [ 3.6 ] then predicted from the best - fitting stellar continuum models .",
    "the median excess , 0.27 mag , suggests that the typical rest - frame emission line equivalent width in the 3.6@xmath3 m filter at @xmath1 is 360 - 450   .",
    "emission lines therefore contribute nearly 30% of the observed [ 3.6 ] broadband photometry .",
    "these values are derived from stellar continuum model fits that include the contaminated 3.6@xmath3 m filter in the modelling . as we demonstrated in  3",
    ", this method produces the most accurate flux estimates .",
    "if the contaminated filter is excluded from the modelling procedure , the inferred continuum level is typically reduced , resulting in a slightly larger median [ 3.6 ] excess ( 0.37 mag ) and total equivalent widths ( 520 - 650   ) .",
    "note these represent the equivalent width of all emission lines in the [ 3.6 ] filter .",
    "we derive the fractional contribution of h@xmath2 below .",
    "based on the discussion in  3.2 , it is likely that these measurements bracket the range of mean nebular emission line strengths in @xmath1 galaxies . reassuringly , this ew range is consistent with that required to explain the 0.33 mag offset in median [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] colors of @xmath4 and @xmath1 galaxies in figure 3 .    to estimate the _ equivalent width distribution _ of emission lines contaminating the irac 3.6@xmath3 m filter , we need to admit a range of equivalent widths to reproduce the observed 3.6@xmath3 m photometric excess distribution of figure 5a .",
    "we assume that equivalent widths are distributed in a log - normal fashion , similar to that seen from h@xmath2 emission locally and at moderate redshifts ( e.g. , lee et al .",

    ", we consider the case whereby the nebular equivalent widths continue to increase following a ( 1+z)@xmath74 power law .",

    ", these issues can be addressed through nebular+stellar population synthesis models described in  3 .",
    "the drawback of this approach is that the appropriate flux from nebular emission for any given model is very uncertain , depending not only on the escape fraction of ionizing radiation but also on the reddening law for the nebular gas , both of which are not known at @xmath0 .    here",

    "since the effect of nebular emission on derived physical properties is clearly redshift - dependent ( c.f .",
    "figure 1 ) , we must account for the distribution of redshifts within a particular dropout sample .",
    "thus for each realization of the nebular line ew distribution , we also select a redshift from the expected photometric redshift distribution of the dropout population under consideration ( see e.g. , bouwens et al .",
    "we fit these realizations of the composite seds using the stellar continuum models described in  3 .",
    "physical properties are determined in a similar manner to that described in  3 , with uncertainties derived from the 1@xmath31 intervals of the large number of realizations of the equivalent width distribution .",

    "these are determined for each dropout population with and without the nebular correction from the composite seds discussed above .",
    "the absolute magnitudes are unchanged in this analysis , so the changes shown are due only to the contamination of broadband light by nebular emission lines . as expected , the impact of nebular emission is strongest in the range @xmath73 where nebular lines contaminate both irac filters .",
    "in contrast , the nebular correction is less severe for the b - drop ( @xmath81 ) population , since the spitzer / irac 4.5@xmath3 m filter is devoid of strong emission lines throughout the redshift range covered by b - drops ( figure 1 ) .    assuming the nebular line ew distribution at @xmath22 remains identical to that determined at @xmath1 , we find that the average stellar masses are reduced by factors of @xmath71.1 , 1.3 , 1.6 , and 2.4 for the dropout populations centered at @xmath82 respectively . if the nebular line strengths increase with redshift at @xmath20 following a ( 1+z)@xmath74 power law ( figure 6 ; fumagalli et al .",

    "to summarize , we have used the equivalent width distributions derived in  4.1 to compute the likely contribution of nebular emission to broadband photometry .",
    "we find that stellar masses at @xmath84 need to be revised downward by 2 - 4@xmath7 , with the precise correction depending on whether the ew of h@xmath2 and [ oiii ] emission continue to increase with redshift beyond @xmath85 .",

    "this result has important implications for derivation of the stellar mass density (  5.1 ) and specific star formation rate evolution (  5.2 ) discussed below .",
    "nebular continuum emission can also contribute to the observed broadband flux density .",
    "most importantly , the addition of nebular continuum reddens the intrinsic spectrum at young ages , thereby requiring less dust extinction to reproduce the observed colors .",
    "this can lead to a reduction in the derived star formation rates , in addition to the reduction in the stellar masses discussed earlier .",
    "the effects of nebular continuum can be seen in the nebular+stellar models , which typically display spectral edges in the vicinity of the balmer/4000     break ( bottom panel of figure 4 ) .",
    "whether significant nebular continuum is actually contributing to the spectra of high - z galaxies is unclear . without better sampled seds ( from e.g. , medium - band near - ir photometry ) that might probe such spectral edges",
    ", it is difficult to verify the presence of nebular continuum , as we are able to with nebular emission lines .",
    "nevertheless if emission lines are very strong , it is likely that there is also a significant contribution from nebular continuum emission .    to quantify the likely impact of nebular continuum on the derived physical properties , we examine how the inferred dust reddening ( and sfr )",
    "are affected when the nebular continuum is added .",
    "to do so , we compare the dust attenuation necessary to reproduce a fixed uv continuum slope for models with and without nebular continuum emission included . assuming a calzetti reddening law",

    "the inferred dust attenuation is reduced for the nebular+stellar models .",
    "the effect is most pronounced at the youngest ages , with the inferred attenuation up to 20% lower for nebular+stellar models with ages @xmath4130 myr .",
    "as a result of the reduced attenuation , a lower normalization is required to match the observed flux density , bringing down the inferred star formation rates by up to the @xmath53% level for the youngest systems . in practice , the impact of nebular continuum is more complicated and non - trivial to predict , depending strongly on the shape ( i.e. age ) of the observed sed .",
    "given these uncertainties , our analysis in the following sections will focus on how physical properties are affected by nebular emission lines .",
    "in the previous section , we used the broadband seds of a large sample of spectroscopically - confirmed galaxies to infer the distribution of nebular line strengths in uv - selected galaxies at @xmath1 .",
    "we showed that the stellar masses inferred from population synthesis modelling are reduced at @xmath22 when the contribution of these lines to broadband flux densities is removed . in this section , we consider the implications of these results for our current picture of early mass assembly .      in  4.2",
    ", we quantified the extent to which the stellar masses of @xmath0 galaxies are affected by nebular emission . here , we seek to utilize these results to estimate the stellar mass density ( smd ) evolution at @xmath0 . to derive the mass densities , we combine the log m@xmath80 - m@xmath35 relationship with uv luminosity functions ( lfs ) in a manner mostly similar to that outlined in gonzalez et al .",
    "briefly , we extract a large number ( @xmath87 ) of luminosities from the measured uv lfs ( e.g. , bouwens et al .",
    "we convert these luminosities to stellar masses using the log m@xmath80 - m@xmath35 relationship , and an estimate of the scatter about the median . whereas earlier studies held the log m@xmath80 - m@xmath35 relationship fixed with redshift at @xmath68 , the strong redshift dependence of nebular contamination ( figure 1 )",
    "forces us to reconsider the evolution of m@xmath80/l@xmath35 ratios with redshift .",
    "we compute the slope and normalization of the @xmath81 log m@xmath80 - m@xmath35 relationship using the large sample of lbgs discussed in stark et al .",
    "for simplicity , we assume the slope remains constant at @xmath68 and consider only evolution in the normalization of the relationship . to compute the zero - points of the log m@xmath80 - m@xmath35 relation at @xmath88 , 6 , and 7",
    ", we adjust the measured @xmath81 relation to account for the relative normalisation of the nebular - corrected log m@xmath80 - m@xmath35 relationships shown in figure 7 . to obtain a tentative estimate of the @xmath89 stellar mass density ,",

    "we use the nebular corrections derived assuming an evolving h@xmath2 ew distribution ( see figure 7 ) , but we also discuss how these results would change if the ew distribution remains fixed at @xmath22 .",
    "in addition to measurement of the log m@xmath80 - m@xmath35 relationship , accurate determinations of the dispersion are necessary to account for low luminosity galaxies with large m@xmath80 /l@xmath35 ratios .",
    "if scatter is not accounted for , the mass functions will be incomplete and mass densities ( above a fixed mass limit ) will be underestimated . while a measurement of the observed scatter at @xmath81 ( 0.5 dex ) was made in gonzalez et al .",
    "( 2011a ) , the intrinsic scatter is likely lower due to systematic uncertainties in the modelling as well as the effects of nebular contamination . in the following , we assume the intrinsic scatter is in the range 0.2 - 0.5 dex .",

    "the results are presented in figure 8 . as discussed in earlier sections ,",
    "if nebular emission is not accounted for in the modelling , the inferred m@xmath80/l@xmath35 ratios actually increase moderately with redshift , leading to artificially high stellar mass densities at @xmath20 .",
    "the inclusion of nebular emission reduces the mass density at @xmath12 by up to 4@xmath7 , while having little effect at @xmath81 . as a result of these redshift - dependent corrections ,",
    "the evolution in the smd is fit by a steeper power law ( [ 1+z]@xmath91 ) than reported previously .",
    "we also consider the smd in galaxies with stellar masses in excess of 10@xmath92 m@xmath38 .",
    "for consistency with earlier measurements of the smd , the measurements we present in figure 8 assume that the log m@xmath80 - m@xmath35 relationship has an intrinsic dispersion of 0.5 dex .",
    "if the scatter is instead only 0.2 dex , for example , we would find stellar mass densities that are @xmath93 lower .",
    "while previous estimates of the @xmath94 smd appeared broadly consistent with the integral of the @xmath95 sfrd ( after an appropriate correction for stellar mass loss and recycling ) , the smd appeared to be on the high end of the range implied by the sfrd ( e.g. , robertson et al . 2010 ) .",

    "note that the ssfr will be _ overestimated _ if one merely uses the log m@xmath80-m@xmath35 relation without taking into account the abundant population of lower sfr objects with large m@xmath80/l@xmath35 ratios .",
    "this issue is dealt with in detail in reddy et al .",
    "( 2012 ) for galaxies at @xmath19 .",
    "unfortunately , as we discussed in  5.1 , the intrinsic scatter is very poorly constrained in uv - selected samples at @xmath68 . as a result ,",
    "previous estimates of the ssfr at @xmath6 have not accounted for m@xmath80/l@xmath35 scatter . to estimate how this shortcoming would affect the ssfr , we add log m@xmath80-m@xmath35 scatter to the lf realization method described above . if the 0.5 dex observed @xmath81 scatter reported in gonzalez et al .",
    "( 2011a ) is entirely intrinsic , then the median ssfr would be reduced by 2.8@xmath7 at @xmath81 .",
    "note that one might find slightly different adjustments for the same scatter at other redshifts owing to evolution in the luminosity function . in ",
    "5.1 , we suggested that the intrinsic scatter is likely lower as systematic uncertainties in modelling ( including uncertainties in the nebular corrections ) surely broaden the dispersion in the stellar masses at fixed uv luminosity . in this case ,",
    "fewer low sfr galaxies contribute to the ssfr distribution at fixed mass , resulting in a larger median ssfr .",
    "for example , a scatter of 0.2 dex would translate into a reduction of just 1.2@xmath7 with respect to the case of no scatter .",
    "physically , one may expect that the scatter at fixed luminosity would increase somewhat between @xmath12 and @xmath81 , as galaxies have had more time to undergo punctuated episodes of star formation which elevate both their star formation rates and mass off of the main sequence .",
    "we consider these possibilities in our discussion below .",
    "we now examine a second issue which pushes the ssfr in the opposite direction .",
    "in particular , we examine how scatter ( and perhaps systematic offsets ) in the conversion between dust - corrected l@xmath35 and sfr affect our ssfr determination .",
    "the conversion between uv luminosity and sfr that we use is valid for galaxies with model ages in excess of 100 myr . above this age ,",
    "the conversion factor changes little for an assumed constant star formation history . but below 100 myr , a larger sfr is required to produce a fixed l@xmath35 ( see figure 25 of reddy et al .",
    "for example , a galaxy with model age of 10 myr requires a 1.8@xmath7 larger sfr to reproduce the same l@xmath35 as a galaxy with 100 myr . with the reduced ages implied by the nebular corrections",
    ", it seems likely that such young systems are present in @xmath68 dropout samples .",
    "inclusion of dispersion in the model ages will preferentially shift the median sfr to larger values , resulting in somewhat larger ssfr .",
    "furthermore , it is of course conceivable , if not likely , that such young systems will become more common both at higher redshift , requiring a systematic shift toward higher ssfr at earlier times .",
    "we now turn to the derived ssfr evolution , which is shown in figure 9a .",
    "first , ignoring the effect of nebular emission and the scatter discussed above , we find that the ssfr actually _ decreases _ marginally with redshift over @xmath18 , similar to the findings of bouwens et al .",
    "( 2012b ) .",
    "this is driven largely by the redshift - dependence of the uv continuum slope @xmath107 relationship .",

    "emission reduces the m@xmath80/l@xmath35 ratios in the @xmath108 lbg samples , increasing the ssfr in this redshift range .",
    "if the nebular line ew distribution at @xmath20 is similar to that seen in figure 5b , we find that the ssfr of galaxies with fixed stellar mass begins to show evidence for positive evolution with redshift , with the @xmath12 value ( 9.6 gyr@xmath103 ) 4@xmath7 larger than that at @xmath8 .",

    "recall that previous indications of a nearly flat ssfr in fixed stellar mass bins at @xmath11 required a mechanism by which star formation is made increasingly inefficient at earlier times .",
    "possibilities included the inefficient formation of molecular hydrogen in metal - poor galaxies ( e.g. , robertson&kravtsov 2008 ; gnedin et al .",
    "2009 ; krumholz & dekel 2012 ) , or an increase in the mass outflow rate per unit star formation with redshift .",
    "the updated estimates of the @xmath0 ssfr no longer obviously require a significant suppression of star formation in galaxies with stellar mass in excess of 10@xmath106 m@xmath38 .",
    "the current measurements seem consistent with a picture whereby the rapidly increasing baryon accretion rates translate into higher ssfr at earlier times .    as with the stellar mass density , there is room for considerable improvements to these estimates in the coming years . by providing more individual detections of uv - faint galaxies , deeper",

    "data , the seds of @xmath89 systems enable a unique method of deciphering how the strength of nebular emission evolves over @xmath110 , one of the key uncertainties in the current analysis .",
    "measurement of the evolving stellar mass and ssfr distributions have proven critical to our understanding of early galaxy assembly and the uv photon budget of reionization - era galaxies .",
    "recently , it has become clear that many of these early estimates might be significantly in error due to the contamination of the _ spitzer_/irac bandpasses by nebular emission lines .",
    "knowledge of the strength of these emission lines is necessary for robust determinations of the stellar mass density and ssfr evolution .",

    "no excess is seen in a spectroscopic sample at @xmath4 , a redshift range over which no strong emission lines contaminate the irac filters .",

    "our primary conclusions from this analysis are summarized below .",
    "we find that the mean equivalent width of emission lines contaminating the [ 3.6 ] filter is @xmath111 @xmath112 .",
    "we estimate that @xmath61% of this signal arises from h@xmath2 , implying an average h@xmath2 equivalent width of @xmath113 @xmath114 at @xmath1 .",
    "\\2 . the mean h@xmath2 equivalent width inferred at @xmath1 appears greater than that for similar star - forming samples at lower redshifts .",
    "while definitive knowledge of the evolution in the h@xmath2 ew surely awaits direct spectroscopic measurement , the evolution we infer over @xmath70 is certainly consistent with the ( 1+z)@xmath74 power law derived in fumagalli et al .",
    "this likely reflects an increase in the ssfr at @xmath72 , and importantly suggests that the ew of nebular emission continues to increase at @xmath20 .",
    "\\3 . using the h@xmath2 ew distribution we derive at @xmath1 , we explore how nebular contamination is likely to affect the physical properties of galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "we find that the stellar masses are reduced , on average , by 1.1 , 1.3 , 1.6 , and 2.4@xmath7 for dropout samples with mean redshifts of @xmath115 , respectively .",
    "if the equivalent widths of nebular lines continue to increase in amplitude at @xmath20 , we estimate that the reduction in the stellar masses are likely to increase to 1.9 and 4.4@xmath7 at @xmath83 and 7 .",
    "we note that these corrections are representative for average measures of the dropout populations and not individual galaxies .    \\4 . as the stellar mass density provides a valuable integrated measure of early star formation , constraints on the level of nebular contamination are critical to our knowledge of the ionizing photon budget of galaxies throughout the reionization era . after correcting for nebular emission contamination , we find a factor of @xmath116 reduction from previous estimates . the downward revisions to the stellar mass density",
    "improve consistency with expectations from the integrated star formation rate density .",
    "extending such nebular - corrected measurements to emerging galaxy samples at @xmath117 will yield an integral constraint on the uv photon budget during @xmath118 .    \\5 . whereas previous derivations showed little evolution in the ssfr of fixed mass galaxies over @xmath14 ,",
    "we demonstrate that after accounting for nebular emission and correcting for dust , the ssfr increases by 4 - 6@xmath7 over @xmath14 .",
    "the absolute ssfr values inferred at @xmath20 appear largely similar with predictions from simulations .",
    "while there certainly remains room for improvement ( in both the data and the modelling ) , the increase in the ssfr at @xmath68 seems consistent with a picture whereby increasing baryon accretion rates at larger redshift translate into larger ssfr in galaxies of a fixed stellar mass .",

    "<S> the observations underpinning these results remain very uncertain , owing in part to the possible contamination of rest - optical broadband light from strong nebular emission lines . to quantify the contribution of nebular emission to broad - band fluxes , we investigate the spectral energy distributions of 92 spectroscopically - confirmed galaxies in the redshift range @xmath1 chosen because the h@xmath2 line lies within the _ spitzer_/irac 3.6@xmath3 m filter . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the 3.6@xmath3 m flux is systematically in excess of that expected from stellar continuum alone , which we derive by fitting the sed with population synthesis models . </S>",

    "<S> the mean rest - frame h@xmath2 equivalent width we infer at @xmath1 ( 270   ) indicates that nebular emission contributes at least 30% of the 3.6@xmath3 m flux and , by implication , nebular emission is likely to have a much greater impact for galaxies with @xmath5 where both warm irac filters are contaminated . via our empirically - derived equivalent width distribution </S>",
