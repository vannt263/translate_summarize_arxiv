    "the future perspectives of the @xmath5 collider da@xmath1ne are discussed at the frascati laboratories ( see also  @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "two projects have been proposed recently : an increase of the peak luminosity to @xmath6 ( da@xmath1ne - ii ) and an increase of the center - of - mass energy up to @xmath7 ( dafne2 , @xcite ) , where the second option might be realized either before or within the high - luminosity - solution . while at da@xmath1ne - ii the main physics motivation is based on the investigation of the parameters of the kaon system ( cp , cpt - violation )",
    ", dafne2 provides the possiblity to measure the timelike nucleon form factors at threshold and to perform hadronic cross section measurements in the @xmath8 energy range , which we will discuss in the following .",
    "some of the components of the present machine are already designed for an energy increase .",
    "the main hardware modifications concern the dipole magnets , the splitter magnets and the low-@xmath9 quadrupoles .",
    "no crucial issues from the accelerator physics point of view can be seen at the moment .",
    "peak luminosities of at least @xmath10 are expected to be in reach for this machine , which allows to collect an integrated luminsity per year of at least @xmath11fb@xmath12 .",
    "hadronic cross section data are of importance for the determination of the hadronic contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , @xmath13 , and for the fine structure constant at the @xmath14 pole , @xmath15 . in the following",
    "we will discuss the impact of dafne2 on the muon anomaly . the hadronic contribution to this fundamental quantity ,",
    "@xmath16 , which is given by the hadronic vacuum polarization , can not be calculated at low energies using perturbative qcd .",
    "a dispersion relation can however be derived , giving @xmath16 as an integral over the hadronic cross section , multiplied by an appropriate kernel .",
    "the dominant contribution to @xmath4 ( @xmath17 ) is given by low energy cross section measurements @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "this is the region where dafne2 will operate .",
    "an improved measurement of hadronic cross sections for the various channels of interest could therefore considerably improve the knowledge on the hadronic contribution to @xmath13 .",
    "this is needed for an interpretation of the recent new measurements @xcite@xcite of the muon anomaly ( e821 collaboration , bnl ) , showing a difference between the experimental and theoretical value of @xmath19 of up to @xmath20 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details concerning the theory evaluation ) .",
    "+ in table  [ tab : tbl2 ] the contributions to @xmath4 and to the squared error @xmath21 are listed for different energy ranges and for different hadronic channels  .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the @xmath22 channel is contributing to @xmath4 to @xmath23 around the @xmath24 peak ( @xmath25 ) , while the contribution to the error @xmath21 in the same energy interval is only @xmath26 .",
    "this difference reflects the fact that the @xmath22 channel around the @xmath24 peak is very well measured now by cmd-2  @xcite  @xcite with a systematic error of @xmath27 .",
    "soon also kloe will publish its results of this channel and of the same energy interval ( see these proceedings ref .",
    "precision measurements for this channel exist also from the analysis of hadronic @xmath28 decays which are related via the cvc - theorem to electron - positron data and can be used for the evaluation of @xmath4 after appropriate isospin corrections . at low energies ( @xmath29 ) and",
    "even more important at high energies ( @xmath30 ) a considerable improvement for the two - pion channel is required .",
    "the contribution to the error @xmath30 is very large ( @xmath31 ) while the absolute contribution to the integral @xmath4 is rather small ( only @xmath32 ) .",
    "dafne2 can play an important role here .",
    "the threshold region ( @xmath33 gev ) will be measured already at the present da@xmath1ne machine in a complementary analysis to the one published now . +",
    "another interesting hadronic channel is the @xmath34 channel where measurements with a precision not better than @xmath35 exist .",
    "the @xmath34 channel becomes important only above @xmath36 and is therefore a good candidate for dafne2 .",
    "this will be discussed in more detail in the following .",
    "the relative contribution of the @xmath34-channel to the error @xmath21 is @xmath37 .",
    "event yield for an integrated luminosity of @xmath38 .",
    "realistic acceptance cuts have been applied : @xmath39 , @xmath40 or @xmath41 .",
    "the yield for radiative muon pair production is also shown .",
    "the statistics is sufficient to normalize the cross section measurement to muon pairs.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]     event yield for an integrated luminosity of @xmath38 .",
    "the dependence of the event rate with the polar angle cut for the pion tracks is shown .",
    "the radiated photon is selected at small angles in order to decrease the relative contribution of fsr events : @xmath40 or @xmath41,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "up to recently an energy scan has been considered as the only way to measure hadronic cross sections @xmath42 at electron - positron colliders .",
    "the kloe and babar @xcite collaborations have shown in the meanwhile that the use of initial state radiation ( isr ) events has to be considered as a complementary and competitive approach at particle factories , which are actually designed for fixed center - of - mass energies w. in this new method - called also radiative return - hadronic events are taken , in which a photon ( energy @xmath43 ) is radiated before annihilation of the @xmath5 pair .",
    "the invariant mass @xmath44 of the hadronic system is given by : @xmath45 .",
    "in general the cross sections @xmath46 and @xmath47 are related through : @xmath48 the radiator function @xmath49 is taken from theory . in the case of kloe",
    "we use the phokhara generator , designed specially for our purposes ( see below ) .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    the design of the dafne2 project foresees the possibility of a systematic variation of the center - of - mass energy in the @xmath3 gev range  .",
    "an energy scan is thus possible .",
    "however , also the radiative return is an option for dafne2 when the center - of - mass energy of the accelerator is kept fixed at e.g. @xmath2 gev or close to the @xmath50 threshold region where measurements of the timelike nucleon form factor are planned . in the following",
    "we will briefly point out the advantages and possible issues of the radiative return method compared to an energy scan .",
    "+ one big advantage of the method is the fact that data comes as a by - product of the standard program of the machine ( e.g. cp violation measurements in the case of kloe / babar ) and no dedicated experimental modifications are needed .",
    "moreover , the method allows to measure the whole energy spectrum below the center - of - mass energy of the accelerator at a time .",
    "systematic errors from luminosity , the knowledge of the machine energy , efficiencies and acceptances have to be determined only for one single energy point ( as a function of @xmath44 though ) and not for each energy bin as it is needed in the case of an energy scan .",
    "+ there are on the other side a series of issues which need to be attacked , especially if the radiative return method is used for a high precision measurement on the level of @xmath51 or below . clearly the method requires a precise theoretical knowledge of the isr - process , i.e. of the radiator function @xmath49 in equation 1 .",
    "a lot of progress has been obtained in the last years and calculations exist now up to nlo by means of the monte carlo generator phokhara  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "another important issue is the suppression of fsr events , since fsr has to be considered as a background to the isr - approach of the radiative return @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the radiation of photons from hadrons can only be calculated within a certain model dependence .",
    "usually the model of scalar qed is chosen for the radiation of photons from e.g. pions .",
    "the actual kloe analysis uses events in which the radiative photon is selected at small angles , which effectively suppresses the relative amount of fsr well below @xmath51 , such that the model dependence becomes negligible .",
    "moreover , the validity of the model for fsr can be tested from data by measuring the charge asymmetry  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite and by comparing the model prediction with data .",
    "event yield for an integrated luminosity of @xmath38 and for realistic selcetion cuts ( see figure caption 1 ) . the number of @xmath52 events is again shown for comparison . , scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "the phokhara monte carlo code has been used to study the event rates for isr - events at dafne2 .",
    "the machine is assumed to operate at @xmath53 .",
    "we have investigated the two - pion - state @xmath54 and the four - pion - states @xmath55 and @xmath56 in the @xmath8 range due to their special importance for the hadronic contribution to the muon anomlay ( see above ) . in figures  [ fig : fig2 ] , [ fig : fig3 ] and  [ fig : fig4 ] the @xmath44 differential event rates for the states @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are shown , where @xmath44 is the invariant mass of the hadronic ( muonic ) system . a bin width of @xmath60 has been chosen .",
    "the plots show the event yield for an integrated luminosity of @xmath61 and for realistic acceptance cuts ( see figure caption for more details ) .",
    "there are no limitations from statistics , since the event yield is in the order @xmath62 events in almost the entire energy range of interest . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] and  [ fig : fig4 ] in addition to the hadronic channels the yield of @xmath52 events is shown , proving that a normalization to muon events is feasible from the statistical point of view . in the following",
    "we briefly present the main experimental issues to be studied :    * the kloe drift chamber @xcite allows a high resolution measurement of the invariant mass @xmath44 for the fully charged hadronic channels . in the case of the @xmath59 channel",
    "the experimental challenge is the correct @xmath63 reconstruction and a possible unfolding of the mass spectrum due to the limited resolution of the kloe electromagneic calorimeter @xcite . *",
    "the suppression of fsr is of great importance for a successful application of the radiative return ( see discussion above ) .",
    "fortunately at @xmath64 the pion form factor is very small such that the relative amount of fsr in the two - pion - channel will be reduced also . *",
    "in contrary to the present kloe analysis there will be no background from @xmath0 decays ( e.g. @xmath65 ) and therefore a much reduced background contamination can be expected at dafne2 .",
    "moreover , also the bhabha cross section is considerably reduced with respect to the present da@xmath1ne machine . * above @xmath66 gev@xmath67 the two - pion cross section is decreasing rapidly ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2 ] ) while the muonic cross section is high .",
    "an efficient separation of pions and muons might become critical in this region .",
    "* kloe does not have experience in the measurements of channels where four tracks are originating from the interaction point .",
    "special reconstruction software has to be developed for the analysis of the @xmath58 channel .    in order to understand the final precision for these radiative return measurements , a dedicated feasibility study , including the kloe detector simulation environment , is needed .",
    "we want to stress that no a - priori limitations for a measurement on the level of few percent can be seen at the moment .",
    "this is sufficient for a sizeable reduction of the contribution above @xmath11 gev to the error on @xmath16 .",
    "the experimental issues discussed above , are similar in the case of an energy scan and do not represent a drawback of the radiative return method .",
    "dafne2 provides the possiblity to measure the hadronic cross section in the @xmath8 energy range .",
    "the radiative return seems a feasible option for these cross section measurements .",
    "special emphasis should be put on the two - pion and four - pion - channels @xmath68 due to their importance for an improved evaluation of the hadronic contribution to the muon anomaly .",
    "the long term goal is a reduction of the error of the hadronic contribution to the muon anomaly to a value @xmath69 .",
    "dafne2 can make a considerable contribution to this goal .",
    "competition comes from the radiative return activities at babar and possible future activities at vepp-2000 , belle and cleo - c ."
