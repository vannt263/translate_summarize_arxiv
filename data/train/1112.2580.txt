    "lofar , the low frequency array , is a large , low - frequency radio telescope in northern europe , led by astron .",
    "construction of the array , which has its core collecting area in the netherlands , with international stations in france , germany , sweden and the uk , is nearly complete , and astronomically interesting data are now being taken .",
    "lofar operates in the 3080 and 120240 mhz frequency ranges .",
    "the 80120 mhz frequency gap corresponds to the fm radio bands at which frequencies astronomical observations would be impossible .",
    "construction of the array is almost complete  see fig [ europe ] for the distribution of operating lofar stations across europe .",
    "in addition , observations are occasionally possible to frequencies as low as 15 mhz . for a full reference paper on lofar see van haarlem et al .",
    "( 2012 ) .",
    "lofar has six _ key science projects _ ( ksps ) ,",
    "one of which is _ transients _ ( principal investigators fender , stappers , wijers ) .",
    "the remit of the tksp covers essentially all transient and variable astrophysics , including commensal searches of all data ( ultimately in near - real - time , although this functionality is not yet implemented ) .",
    "the tksp covers both time - series and image - plane searches for transients and variables , including pulsars ( stappers et al .",
    "the adoption of transients and variables as key science drivers for the project is a theme for most of the large ska pathfinders and precursors , in general unlike older radio facilities .",
    "however , time - series and image - plane transients have been separated for both askap ( which has _ craft _ and _ vast _ respectively ) and meerkat ( _ trapum _ and _ thunderkat _ ) .",
    "this makes some sense from a techniques point of view , although there is some overlap in the science .",
    "so what are these transients which we re looking for ? in planning for transients searches , whether via targeted surveys or blind commensal studies , we can crudely separate events by both astrophysics and techniques .",
    "incoherent synchrotron emission arises from the acceleration of relativistic electrons in magnetic fields .",
    "this has a brightness temperature ( intensity ) limit of @xmath0k , and is associated with essentially all events which inject kinetic energy into the ambient medium ( e.g. jets of all types , nova and supernova explosions ) .",
    "these events tend to evolve relatively slowly , especially at low frequencies ( where the optical depth is higher ) , and so with lofar we do not expect to see variability on timescales shorter than the standard imaging timescale of 110 sec .",
    "coherent events , such as radio pulsars or masers , can have much higher brightness temperatures . like synchrotron events they can be at times associated with extreme astrophysical environments .",
    "the much higher brightness temperatures means that the variability timescales can be much shorter , and even astrophysically distant objects can vary on timescales much shorter than the standard imaging timescale . however , such short bursts are dispersed and scattered in the intervening interstellar medium , and this needs to be corrected for in studying the intrinsic properties of the burst ( this is a well - understood problem in the field of radio pulsars ) .",
    "note that there can be considerable overlap between these two sets of objects and techniques : e.g. variability of coherent sources can be detected and tracked in images .",
    "fig [ flavours ] summarises this dichotomy in radio transients , and is indicative of how early attempts at automated classification pipelines might make an early branch based upon variability timescales and polarisation characteristics .",
    "lofar can operate in a variety of modes , all of which can be important for the study of transients and variables .",
    "furthermore , all of these modes can be operated at a variety of levels from a single station to the entire pan - european array .",
    "* interferometric * lofar is a ` software telescope ' with essentially no moving parts .",
    "pointing of the array and/or individual stations is done by introducing delays appropriate to a certain direction on the sky ( phased array ) .",
    "different frequencies can be therefore set to observe in different directions by introducing different delays .",
    "lofar can already , as a standard imaging mode , produce 8 beams each of 6 mhz bandwidth . in the low band",
    "these beams can be placed anywhere on the sky ; in the high band they are limited by the beam of the high band tiles , which each have an analogue beamformer .",
    "this allows for an extraordinary instantaneous field of view : @xmath1 square degrees in the low band , and @xmath2 square degrees in the high band . in other words , in the low band the entire northern hemisphere could be mapped in less than 30 sets of pointings ( with sparse tiling ) .",
    "initial processing of wide - field surveys for transients , including the msss survey , due for late-2011 through early-2012 , will only localise sources to a few arcmin , but later and/or responsive observations could localise interesting sources ( including transients ) to arcsec precision .    *",
    "timing * lofar also has high time resolution ( ` pulsar ' ) modes , which can achieve 10s of ns time resolution and map either full field of view with sensitivity @xmath3 ( incoherent sum ) or the synthesised beam with sensitivity @xmath4 ( where smaller @xmath5 is better ) .",
    "recently it has been possible to simultaneously record data from over 100 coherent tied - array beams and tile out the entire hba field .",
    "see stappers et al .",
    "( 2011 ) for more on searches for fast transients with lofar .",
    "* direct storage * the lofar transients buffer boards ( tbbs ) can be used to record up to several seconds of full bandwidth antenna level data ( or longer , in a trade - off with bandwidth ) , _ before _ the beam - forming stage .",
    "this means that beams can be formed retrospectively in a certain direction anywhere in the sky ( lba ) or tile beam ( hba ) upon receipt of an ` internal ' ( from lofar itself ) or ` external ' ( e.g. voevent ) alert .",
    "currently this mode is being developed and pursued by the _ cosmic rays _",
    "ksp ( pi falcke ) .     where @xmath6 is the field of view and @xmath5 the sensitivity",
    ", where smaller @xmath5 is more sensitive ) . for lofar ,",
    "the points indicate the raw sensitivities , the open circles represent a spectral correction for a spectral index of -0.7 ( where spectral index @xmath7 is in the sense that @xmath8 ) , appropriate for optically thin synchrotron emission .",
    "the open circles correspond to a correction for a spectral index of @xmath9 , corresponding to the steepest ( aged ) synchrotron sources , as well as some coherent radio sources ( such as pulsars and other flavours of neutron star).,width=415 ]",
    "as noted above , lofar , askap and meerkat have all embraced the science of radio transients as part of their key science programme . to this list",
    "we can hopefully add apertif , the focal - plane array upgrade to wsrt , to which several transients - oriented proposals have been submitted as statements of interest for its ksp programme .    in a global context , lofar has the widest field of view of any of the major facilities and , although its suffers in terms of raw mjy sensitivity compared to e.g. evla , meerkat , when a spectral correction is made it can be demonstrated to be a very powerful facility .",
    "this is illustrated by fig [ newfov ] in sensitivity and field of view are compared for a range of world - class radio facilities .",
    "the solid diagonal lines correpond to constant figures of merit ( fom , defined as @xmath10 , where @xmath6 is the field of view and @xmath5 is the sensitivity , with smaller @xmath5 more sensitive ) .",
    "the four new or upgraded ghz facilities , evla , meerkat , apertif and askap , all have a comparable fom . for lofar it is not until a spectral correction is made that its survey power becomes apparent ( see figure caption for more details ) .",
    "mjy sensitivity every 24 hr .",
    "the figure demonstrates the enormous field of view of lofar.,width=415 ]",
    "the lofar tksp have considered several approaches to the detection of transients and variables , consisting of a programme of targeted searches , wide - field blind surveys , and commensal searches for transients .",
    "* targeted surveys . * within the tksp there are a number of targeted observations and surveys planned and , in some cases , under way .",
    "these include observations of well - known high - energy astrophysics sources with variable radio counterparts ( e.g. the binary ss 433 , the pulsar psr 0329 + 54 , the blazar pks 1510 - 089 ) .",
    "they also include targets beyond the usual suspects , which may provide breakthroughs in some research areas ( e.g. a search of nearby stars for radio bursts from ` hot jupiters ' ) .",
    "in addition , it is our intention to probe transient parameter space by searching for concentrations of mass and/or exotic objects at a range of distances ( and hence luminosities ) from us .",
    "these include globular clusters within our own galaxy , to m31 , the core of the virgo cluster and beyond .    * wide - field blind surveys .",
    "* an example of a wide - field blind survey planned for lofar is the zenith monitoring programme , a key component of the ` radio sky monitor ' ( rsm ) programme .",
    "fig [ zenith ] illustrates how a small number of 7-pointing tiles could cover the entire zenith strip ( dec + 54 for lofar ) , with maximum sensitivity ( which peaks at the zenith for the dipoles ) .",
    "for example , with the lbas at around 60 mhz , a 10-degree wide strip could be covered in 16 tiles , surveying around 2000 square degrees ( 10% of the northern hemisphere ; note that this is for fairly dense tiling ) .",
    "assuming a dedicated phase of rsm observing ( perhaps likely to happen once or twice per year for a few weeks , in coordination with other multiwavelength facilities ) with 100% of resources spent on this , this would correspond to @xmath11 hr on each field , resulting in an expected r.m.s .",
    "of a few mjy . at the lowest frequencies it only takes two more tiles to cover the entire northern galactic plane , which may well sample a different population of transients",
    "at present , we have been monitoring a single part of the zenith field , containing the bright pulsar psr 0329 + 54 , and using that to constrain and estimate the rate of low frequency transients ( bell , 2011 ) .",
    "note that the _ aartfaac _ project ( pi wijers ) plans to use the lofar core in parallel with other observing programmes to perform a quasi - continuous low angular resolution survey of the entire northern hemisphere for transients .    * commensal surveys .",
    "* since the initial design of lofar it has been a stated goal of the tksp that lofar data are imaged on short ( @xmath12 sec ) timescales in close to real time , to look for bright transients and variables .",
    "this functionality is yet to be implemented , but is in the design and commissioning plan for 2012 . in the meantime",
    ", the tksp has the goal of searching all other observations performed by lofar in order to look for transients .",
    "this will naturally give us a range of wide - field and deep surveys ( consider e.g. those planned by the _ surveys _ and _ epoch of reionisation _ ksps ) with which to probe transient phase space .",
    "it is not unreasonable to assume that the entire northern hemisphere will effectively be surveyed several times per year , as well as deeper pointings with much higher cadence .",
    "until recently , the best estimates for predicted rates were around 0.1 sources deg@xmath13 for two - epoch transients and a flux density limit of @xmath14 mjy ( bell 2011 , based on bower et al .",
    ". however , frail et al . (",
    "2011 ) have noted that this may be an overestimate by up to an order of magnitude . for the zenith monitoring programme outlined above",
    ", we could have 2000 deg@xmath15 surveyed to approximately this r.m.s",
    ". per 24 hr , resulting in a transient detection rate  from this programme alone  of between 20 ( frail ) and 200 ( bower ) events _ per day_. considering commensal searches of all data , which may on any given day be going wide , deep , or some combination , we should conservatively expect in excess of ten high - significance transient events per day .",
    "one major unknown here is what fraction of events will turn out to be repeaters ",
    "i.e. the true number of distinct astrophysical variables found may be lower than this .",
    "note that it is our stated policy to report these events as widely as possible , probably vis some version of the voevent protocol ( e.g. via skyalert.org ) .",
    "lofar has a wide range of diverse capabilities ( multi - beaming , simultaneous timing and imaging modes , splitting of array in large numbers of individual stations , re - imaging in the past with the tbbs ) which are ideally suited for exploring transient parameter space .",
    "just as importantly , there is the will to support this science , with a key science project dedicated to precisely this exploration .",
    "based on current estimates , it should find many 1000s of interesting radio transients per year , providing a huge target list for multiwavelength follow - up , and providing new tests of our ability to automatically detect , classify and report such events efficiently ."
