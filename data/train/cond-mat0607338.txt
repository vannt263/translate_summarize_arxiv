    "half - metallic ferromagnets have been proposed as ideal candidates for spin injection devices because they have been predicted to exhibit 100  % spin polarization at the fermi energy ( @xmath3 ) @xcite . from the applications point of view , a high curie temperature for a half - metallic ferromagnet may be an important condition .",
    "for this reason , heusler alloys ( @xmath2 structure ) have recently attracted great interest .",
    "some of these alloys exhibit high curie temperatures and , according to theory , should have a high spin polarization at the fermi energy @xcite .",
    "calculations also show that anti - site disorder will destroy the high spin polarization @xcite , implying that precise control of the atomic structure of the heusler alloys is required .",
    "the heusler alloy co@xmath0mnsi has attracted particular interest because it is predicted to have a large minority spin band gap of 0.4  ev and , at 985  k , has one of the highest curie temperature , among the known heusler compounds @xcite .",
    "structural and magnetic properties of co@xmath0mnsi have been reported for films and single crystals @xcite . from tunnelling magneto resistance ( tmr ) data with one electrode consisting of a co@xmath0mnsi film sakuraba _",
    "et al _ @xcite measured a tmr ration of 159  % at 2k and @xmath4  % at 300k . if using co@xmath0fesi as one electrode inomata _",
    "et al _ @xcite obtained tmr ratios of 60  % at 5k and 41  % at 300k .",
    "an important quantity for the application of the half - metallic ferromagnets is the size of the gap in the minority states and the position of @xmath3 inside of the gap .",
    "small gaps may be easily destroyed by temperature effects or quasi - particle excitations @xcite .",
    "the half - metallicity may also be easily destroyed if @xmath3 is located close to the band edges , either of the minority valence or conduction bands .",
    "the recent tmr results @xcite show that elctrodes made of heusler compounds result in high tmr ratios at low temperatures but the temperature dependence is still a challenge which has to be solved to use heusler electrodes in applications .",
    "the present investigation focuses on searching for a mixed compound where the half - metallic behaviour is stable against temperature effects .",
    "the self - consistent electronic structure calculations were carried out using the full potential linearized augmented plane wave method ( flapw ) as provided by wien2k @xcite .",
    "the lda@xmath5 method @xcite was used to account for on - site correlation at the transition metal sites .",
    "semi - empirical values corresponding to 7.5% of atomic values of coulomb - exchange parameter have been used as suggested in our previous publication @xcite .",
    "the size of the minority band gap and position of @xmath3 can be seen from the calculated energies displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] for the heusler alloy co@xmath0mn@xmath6fe@xmath7si . in co@xmath0mnsi",
    ", @xmath3 is close to the top of the valence band . in co@xmath0fesi ,",
    "the situation is different and @xmath3 is near to the bottom of the conduction band .",
    "both of the compounds are at the two corners of the gap . in co@xmath0mn@xmath1fe@xmath1si @xmath3",
    "is directly in the middle of the minority band gap and therefore this compound should be more stable against temperature effects or quasi - particle excitations compared to pure co@xmath0mnsi and co@xmath0fesi .",
    "co@xmath0mn@xmath1fe@xmath1si samples were prepared by arc melting of stoichiometric amounts of the constituents in an argon atmosphere at 10@xmath8  mbar .",
    "the polycrystalline ingots were then annealed in an evacuated quartz tube at 1273  k for 21  days .",
    "the samples exhibiting the heusler type @xmath2 structure with a lattice parameter of 5.64   ( see fig .",
    "another proof of the high order of the samples are the results from the @xmath9fe mbauer spectra taken of the samples ( see fig .",
    "the spectrum is dominated by an intense sextet with a line width of approximately @xmath10  mm / s .",
    "in addition to the sextet , a much weaker line at the centre of the spectrum is visible .",
    "its contribution to the overall intensity of the spectrum is approximately 3.5  % .",
    "the origin of the singlet may be caused by anti - site disorder leading to a small fraction of paramagnetic fe atoms .",
    "the hyperfine field ( hff ) at the fe sites amounts to @xmath11  a / m . for more details and other properties of the whole series of co@xmath0mn@xmath6fe@xmath7si with the fe concentration ranging from @xmath12 to 1 in steps of 0.1",
    "see ref.@xcite .",
    "electronic structure calculations predicted the heusler compound co@xmath0mn@xmath1fe@xmath1si due to the position of @xmath3 in the middle of the minority band gap as very stable against any kind of effects destroying the halfmetalicity and therefore well suited for spintronic applications .",
    "polycristaline samples were prepared exhibiting @xmath2 structure and a high magnetic order ."
