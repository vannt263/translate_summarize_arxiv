    "chemicals act on chemicals to produce new chemicals , goods act on goods to produce new goods , ideas act on ideas to produce new ideas .",
    "the concept that elements of a set act on other elements of the same set to produce new elements which then become part of this set is ubiquitous not only in nature but also in social systems and processes .",
    "we might think of the development of modern chemistry , where the invention of a new compound leads to possibilities to use this compound ( as a catalyst ) to produce yet another compound .",
    "the same is true for economy , where one newly introduced good can be used as a tool to produce new goods and tools .",
    "other famous example are recent models of evolution , maybe even our whole concept of history in general can be seen as a process of this type .",
    "maybe the most fascinating question associated with these processes is under which conditions self - sustaining systems can emerge , i.e. that the newly produced chemicals , goods , or ideas find adequate other new or old chemicals , goods , and ideas such that they can act on each other to produce yet new products , and so on . for any scientific approach to this subject",
    "it is clear that it is necessary to specify rules , which product can act on another product to produce a third one .",
    "for example there is a chemical rule that oxygen and hydrogen will produce water but there is no rule that gold and helium can form a compound . there is a rule that a hammer acting on a block of iron will produce sheet metal , but no rule that welding together two blocks of uranium 238 will lead to a big block of uranium .",
    "if one imagines that all existing and non - existing  but possible  products are listed in a high dimensional vector , than the rules how those elements can act on each other can be thought of elements in an interaction matrix , where a zero entry means no interaction , and a non - zero element gives the interaction strength .    in history",
    "there have been plenty of instances where a system of the above type underwent a transition from a state with very few products to a state of vast abundance of products .",
    "these transitions happen over relatively short timescales .",
    "an example from biology is the cambrian explosion @xcite , where an unprecedented number of new taxa emerged within very short timescales .",
    "an economical example is the industrial revolution , where the number of industrial goods exploded to previously unimaginable numbers , a social example is the explosion of culture with the advent of the renaissance , or a more modern example the explosion of the number chemical compounds in the last century .",
    "all of these explosive processes share the same structure : there are possibly constructively interacting elements , interaction is governed by a set of rules ( natural laws , social consensus , religious restrictions ) , and a number of initially existing products .",
    "what does trigger the explosive event , why is this event sometimes missing for very long timeperiods ? the only parameters at hand are : the number of rules , the number of initially present elements , and a possible structure in the interaction matrix .",
    "it is likely that the cultural explosion was driven by an increase of rules which was possible by driving back religious restrictions .",
    "the explosion of chemical compounds was possible by discovering the rules of modern chemistry .",
    "let us mention here that for well studied systems the set of rules can in principle be known completely . however , for large systems , it might be wise as a first step to model them stochastically , i.e. let the interaction matrix be a random matrix . in this case",
    "there will of course be no structure in the interaction matrix , and the only parameters will be rule density @xmath0 and initial number @xmath1 of existing elements .",
    "since quite some time there has been conjectured the existence of a phase transition in the above systems , e.g. in @xcite . by this",
    "we mean that in the @xmath2 plane there exist well defined regions , which are practically unpopulated , or almost fully populated , with a sharp transition between the regimes .",
    "this means that fixing the number of initial elements there exists a critical density of rules @xmath3 .",
    "when the system is below @xmath3 the number of elements will remain relatively low compared to the total number of possible products . above @xmath3 the system will become self - sustaining and drive towards a heavyly populated state .    even though this setting seems to be fundamental to a variety of disciplines , and its importance has long been noticed @xcite , the progress of a systematic scientific treatment of these problems is limited .",
    "relevant contributions to this field come from chemistry and biology .",
    "the adequate mathematical treatment of such processes are so - called catalytic equations , which are sets of coupled , quadratic , ordinary differential equations . special cases of those equations are for example the class of lotka - volterra replicators , the hypercycle @xcite , or more recent ideas like the turing gas @xcite .",
    "replicator dynamics , which is linear , is obtained from catalytic dynamics by a proper scaling of time .",
    "it is needless to mention that the non - linear catalytic equations carry tremendous potential of complex dynamics , however , in earlier studies some robustness in terms of fixed points seems to have been observed . for more details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to prove the existence and study details of the nature of the above mentioned phase transition .",
    "this is possible by introducing some concepts of set theory , and  making use of the random structure of the production rules  by mapping the size of a consecutive series of sets into a set of update equations , which can be solved and analyzed .",
    "the analytic formulas give insights into what is happening at the transition .",
    "a practical aspect of this present work is that we cover analytically the large system limit , which is beyond numerical reachability , and has sofar not been possible to study .",
    "the intuition for this work is based on a bit - string formulation of the above problem , which is a generalization of models recently termed random grammars @xcite . in the bit - string model",
    "there is a set of initial bit - strings and a set of strings which act on these strings by either combining strings or substituting sub - strings .",
    "these latter strings can be seen as catalysts , their existence constitutes the presence of rules of what can be combined and/or substituted .",
    "the model which is presented below can be shown to be one to one compatible with the substitution and combination rules in the kauffman bit - string model .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : section 2 , where the hard working authors state the formal problem and develop the necessary notation and concepts .",
    "section 3 , where the brave authors derive the set of update equations .",
    "section 4 , where the struggling authors succeed in solving these equations reasonably well , and section 5 , where the victorious authors present their results . in section 6",
    "we discuss the results .",
    "our basic concept is to view the abundances of all possible products as entries in a @xmath4-dimensional time - dependent vector @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath6 is the quantity of product @xmath7 present at time @xmath8 .",
    "we drop the time notation in the following .",
    "the population dynamics of a system , where product @xmath7 under the influence of product @xmath9 produces product @xmath10 is given by network - equations of the following type @xmath11 with @xmath12 , and the component @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is the domain of nodes  or put in fancier terms  the index set of the dynamic process .",
    "@xmath15 is the inner product of statevector @xmath16 with dimensionality @xmath17 , the number of all possible products or nodes .",
    "the statevector is a vector of relative frequencies @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "each @xmath20 is a linear operator providing the quadratic forms @xmath21 and encodes the structural information about which binary combinations @xmath22 , the _ substrates _ , can interact in order to form _ product _ @xmath10 .",
    "each entry in @xmath23 is a real number , however , for the sake of simplicity we consider only 1 for interaction or 0 for no interaction .",
    "@xmath23 can be thought of as the set of rules how objects interact . in the following @xmath23",
    "is sampled as a random matrix in the following way : we assume that for each _ product _ @xmath12 there are _ pairs of substrate _",
    "@xmath24 such that @xmath25 . in words ,",
    "this arrow means : @xmath10 is produced by substrate @xmath26 under the influence of substrate @xmath27 .",
    "note , that @xmath26 and @xmath27 do not have to be unique , there can be more than one pair @xmath28 producing a specific product @xmath10 .",
    "lets call the number of pairs leading to product @xmath10 , @xmath29 .",
    "we define the _ production rule density _ as the average number of pairs leading to one product @xmath30    equations like ( [ cata ] ) are long known for their rather surprising robustness in terms of fixed points where the system converges to .",
    "this is not obvious and one would rather expect a situation more dominated by more complicated orbits and limit cycles . for a more detailed discussion of this type of equations",
    "see @xcite .",
    "fixed points will therefore provide much information about the effective behavior of such systems , the fixed point equation being @xmath31 we are dealing with a nonlinear process , so that the solutions of the network - equation will in general depend strongly on the initial conditions . even assuming the process to be driven towards a stable fixed point does not imply the uniqueness of that fixed point .",
    "we want to get some feeling what to expect when investigating the population dynamics of randomly sampled fixed 0/1-networks .",
    "the dynamical properties of eq .",
    "( [ cata ] ) are linked to specific topologies . knowing the topologic features will enable one to solve for the dynamics .",
    "not knowing the interaction tensor @xmath32 exactly , and only given its statistical properties , following the classical concept of statistical physics , one still can understand the expected dynamics of the system , and in particular its expected final outcome .",
    "we hence study the system in a probabilistic fashion , i.e. averaging over all possible topologies . the choices for @xmath33 are equally distributed and @xmath34 and @xmath35 can be seen as independent random variables    the question we try to answer is : with how many products do we expect to end up with when starting from a given number of randomly choosen initial substrate species ? before we proceed we need a number of definitions .",
    "we denote the number of elements contained in some set @xmath36 by writing @xmath37 , and define the _ support _ of a process at a given time @xmath38 suppose that the process is driven to a ( stable ) fixed point such that the final support is @xmath39 inversely , we can ask which initial conditions end up in the same fixed point and define the body of this fixed point to be the set @xmath40 we further define the following operations on product - sets : the _ foreward difference _ of set @xmath36 , @xmath41 and the _ backward difference _ of @xmath36 , @xmath42 with these operations we can define the _ foreward closure _ of set @xmath36 @xmath43 and the _ backward closure _ of a set , @xmath44 these definitions can best be understood by viewing our dynamical system eq .",
    "( [ cata ] ) as a directed graph whose nodes are connected by arrows .",
    "a node looking at its edges can therefore distinguish between feather ends or arrow heads .",
    "a node holding a feather end of an arrow is a substrate , a node holding an arrow head is a product with respect to this edge .",
    "given some set of nodes we can identify for each node @xmath10 all the nodes which will be formed due to the influence of @xmath10 in the next timestep . in this sense",
    "we say the nodes look foreward. the foreward difference of some set is therefore the set of all products the nodes of the set look foreward to , excluded the products that are already present as nodes of the set we started out with .",
    "the backward difference follows the same idea only looking at the arrows from arrowhead towards the feathers .",
    "the corresponding closures are then simply obtained by adding the set - differences iteratively to the initial set , i.e. we add the difference to the initial set and form a new difference on the first extension of the set , then add this difference to obtain the second extension of the initial set and so on , until the difference ( forward or backward ) is empty and the iterative process comes to a halt . that this eventually may happen can be understood by looking at chains of arrows as an example .",
    "take a node and add an arrow pointing at some other randomly chosen node in the set . in the beginning",
    "the chance to select a virginal node is high and the chain will grow but as the chain grows the probability of sampling a member already in the chain increases , and even though the single sample probability may still be small , the chance to sample into the chain eventually is not . for clarity let us summarize our philosophy : all objects which can possibly act on each other are represented by the index set @xmath14 of the processing system eq .",
    "( [ cata ] ) , which contains all the names of the considered and thinkable objects .",
    "the index set provides the domain for all dynamical considerations .",
    "properties of the system are implemented via the map @xmath45 , which are the relative frequencies of the indexed species in the domain .",
    "we are not interested in particular weights but only in the directed network topology coded by the matrices @xmath20 on the domain @xmath14 .",
    "not only does this topological approach provide us with the means to talk about randomly distributed productive substrate pairs , but also about their density of occurrence @xmath0 .",
    "even more important , if we are not interested in details of the dynamics but decide to focus only on how large the expected final set will be ( given some initial substrate set and density ) we can drop dynamical considerations and pass to topological ones .",
    "we are not interested in how much of each object species we will effectively end up with , just if it got produced or not .",
    "the subset of the domain that is effectively populated is called the support @xmath46 . to investigate the flow of the support under the network equation we may utilize set - operations compatible with the topological structure of directed reaction graphs leading to the definition of the forward and the backward difference and their respective closures .",
    "it is intuitively clear , that the forward closure of some set is the subset of the domain that is flooded by the initial set during the production process .",
    "it necessarily forms an upper limit for the size of possible self - sustainable subsets of the domain reachable from the initial condition . in a simplification considering an equally distributed random interaction topology",
    "we gain a notion of expected growth rates for the set - differences based on expected sampling rates .",
    "this leads to equations of expected growth as demonstrated next .",
    "we now develop a method to compute the size of the foreward closure @xmath47 as a function of the production rule density and the size of the initial set @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath48 is the final number of products once the system has converged .",
    "the probability of some fixed @xmath10 being the product of some fixed pair of substrates , @xmath49 and @xmath50 is obviously @xmath51    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     let us define @xmath52 . as an approximation imagine for a moment that @xmath53 is a constant in time @xmath54 .",
    "then for the forward closure @xmath55 a choice @xmath54 which produces the right asymptotical results is @xmath56 which is seen by first dividing the right part of eq .",
    "( [ growth ] ) by @xmath57 and then taking the @xmath58 limit .",
    "now use the ansatz @xmath59 which leads to a polynomial of third degree @xmath60 , or in terms of @xmath54 @xmath61 substituting @xmath62 reduces to equation @xmath63 with @xmath64 so that cardano s method can be used with @xmath65 to get @xmath66^{\\frac13}\\qquad z=-\\frac{p}{3y } \\quad , \\ ] ] providing us with three solutions @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",
    "we are only interested in the real solution @xmath67 which yields the final result @xmath71 which is a good approximation of the true solution of the forward equation eq .",
    "( [ growth ] ) and is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_fw ] ( b ) in the @xmath1@xmath0 plane .",
    "the comparison with fig .",
    "1 ( a ) demonstrates the quality of the analytical solution .",
    "the analytical form of the solution allows us to understand the origin of the phase transition . for this reason",
    "we observe that we can compute @xmath48 by solving @xmath72 providing us with two solutions @xmath73 these solutions are shown in figs . [ fig_pm ] ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "it becomes obvious that the phase transition actually always takes place by the system switching from the one solution to the other at @xmath74 .",
    "below a critical value of @xmath3 the one solution smoothely passes into the other .",
    "we observe a crossover of the probable and the _ improbable _ solution .",
    "most likely this is due to a convexity argument , implying the monotonicity of the size of the forward closure with respect to the size of the initial condition .",
    "the size of the forward closure will not shrink with increasing the initial set size and therefore has to jump to the alternative solution at some critical line . as long as the third order polynomial is strictly monotonic we have a unique real solution for the zero of the polynomial . at @xmath3",
    "the polynomial starts to have a local minimum and maximum and we have in fact two relevant real zeros ( out of three ) , the large and the small solution .",
    "@xmath3 is determined by the tripple zero of the polynomial .",
    "note a famous analogy here : just as in the vanderwaal s gas we can draw maxwell lines . at the phase - transition ,",
    "the small solution becomes instable , the large solution becomes stable . here",
    "the productive pair density @xmath0 takes the role of temperature in the vanderwaal s gas . below the critical value a system _",
    "freezes _ into a small set of durable species , while above the critical production law density , supercritical but yet small sets of individuals _ evaporate _ into their foreward closure .",
    "the difference we have here compared to vanderwaal s gas is that the _ liquid _ phase is concentrated on the high edge of the phase transition , while the phase - plane itself is a solid - liquid mixture .",
    "we have developed a way to map a conceptual system of autocatalytic agents into a quantitative framework . with this",
    "it is possible to show that the combination of the initial number of products @xmath1 and the density of mutual production rules @xmath0 is crucially influencing the mode of growth of sets of products .",
    "our main result is that we were able to map the class of random catalytic networks into a set of growth equations , which allows us to study the expectation value of the final number of products .",
    "the resulting equation can be solved and shows a clear phase transition from practically unpopulated zones towords almost fully populated ones , in rule density  initial number of products space .",
    "the transition is a crossover between two sets of solutions to a quadratic equation .",
    "we believe that this nicely resembles numerical - experimental findings of @xcite , where the authors find a decrease of species with an increase of @xmath75 in their fig . 1 ( d ) .",
    "the fact that the transition from small to full forward closure sizes is gradual , is either due to the limited system size ( 10 species ) , or that the initial support was high , i.e. above @xmath74 , so that no sharp increase could be found .",
    "in fact , systems of the type of eq .",
    "( [ cata ] ) are straight forwardly solvable numerically up to system sizes of about @xmath76 within reasonable computing time .",
    "we note that the practical value of this present work is that it captures the large system size limit , which is out of numerical reach and was not tractable analytically before .",
    "the present approach does not try to explain the detailed role of auto catalytic cycles nor of keynode species in the context of understanding the beginning of an explosion of species numbers as was very nicely done for example in @xcite .",
    "the periods of fast extinction reported there are not incorporated in our consideration yet , since we have not taken any evolutionatry hypotheses into account so far , nor did we incorporate evolutionary concepts in the sense that products are associated characteristics ( some sort of fitness , e.g. the weight @xmath77 ) upon which they can get selected by some method . taking these arguments into account seems a natural starting point for future research .",
    "we believe that it should be possible that a combination of backward and forward closure arguments can be used to estimate a critical density of auta catalytic cycles necessary for a system to become critical as studied here . we have not so - far considered negative entries in the interaction matrices , which should also be present in natural or social systems .",
    "finally , we mention that our arguments given here should  due to the absence of a characteristic scale in the update equations  not be limited to finite sets .",
