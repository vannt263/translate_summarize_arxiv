    "parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) in the nucleon have been obtained by analyzing high - energy nucleon reaction data @xcite .",
    "such an analysis is crucial for calculating precise cross sections for finding new physics phenomena .",
    "these investigations are valuable for clarifying internal hadron structure , and the studies ultimately lead to establishment of the nonperturbative aspect of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "it is well known that nuclear parton distribution functions ( npdfs ) are modified from those of the nucleon @xcite .",
    "it was first found by the european muon collaboration ( emc ) .",
    "now , major features of the @xmath2-dependent modification became clear experimentally .",
    "although a variety of data are not still available in comparison with the nucleonic case , the pdf parametrization could be done for the npdfs @xcite . the first @xmath6 analysis for the npdfs",
    "was done in ref .",
    "@xcite by using a similar technique to the polarized pdf analysis of the asymmetry analysis collaboration ( aac ) @xcite .",
    "there are also related studies on nuclear shadowing @xcite .",
    "the word  shadowing \" is used for nuclear modification at @xmath7 throughout this paper .",
    "these npdf studies are valuable for describing high - energy nuclear scattering phenomena @xcite .",
    "high - energy heavy - ion reactions have been investigated for finding a quark - gluon plasma signature . because such a signature should be found in a modification of cross sections , the npdfs should be exactly known .",
    "in addition , there is a strong demand from the neutrino community to have precise neutrino - nucleus , typically the oxygen nucleus , cross sections for investigating neutrino oscillation phenomena accurately @xcite .",
    "these necessities motivated us to investigate the npdf parametrization .",
    "in addition , it is interesting to find how well the npdfs are determined .",
    "there have been studies of pdf uncertainties in the nucleon .",
    "it was investigated in the unpolarized pdfs @xcite , and then the studies were extended to the polarized pdf uncertainties @xcite . although error bands are shown for the npdfs in ref .",
    "@xcite , they are not based on a rigorous error analysis . here , we calculate the npdf uncertainties by using the hessian method , which is a standard statistical procedure for estimating errors @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to report investigations after the publication in ref .",
    "in particular , the followings are added to the previous analysis : ( 1 ) drell - yan data are included in the data set .",
    "( 2 ) hermes data are also added .",
    "( 3 ) charm - quark distribution is included .",
    "( 4 ) uncertainties of the npdfs are estimated by the hessian method .",
    "this paper consists of the following . in sec.[method ] , the @xmath6 analysis method , in particular the parametrization form and experimental data , is explained .",
    "analysis results are shown in sec.[results ] and they are summarized in sec.[summary ] .",
    "we discuss the @xmath6 analysis method .",
    "first , the @xmath2 and @xmath8 dependence of the initial pdfs is explained , and comments are given on charm - quark distributions .",
    "then , experimental data are introduced , and the uncertainty estimation method is explained .",
    "the npdfs are provided by a number of parameters at a fixed @xmath5 , which is denoted @xmath9 .",
    "the npdfs could be directly expressed by a functional form with parameters , which are obtained by a @xmath6 analysis",
    ". however , experimental data are not sufficient for fixing detailed npdfs .",
    "therefore , it is more practical at this stage to parametrize nuclear modification rather than the npdfs themselves .",
    "namely , a npdf is taken as the corresponding nucleonic pdf multiplied by a weight function @xmath10 : @xmath11 the nuclear modification part @xmath10 is obtained by a @xmath6 analysis . here , @xmath8 is the mass number and @xmath12 is the atomic number of a nucleus .",
    "one of the essential points of the @xmath6 analysis is how to choose the @xmath2 and @xmath8 dependent functional form .",
    "because nuclear modification mechanisms are different depending on the @xmath2 region , the @xmath8 dependence could be different in each @xmath2 region .",
    "if we would like to describe @xmath10 precisely , it could be a complicated function of mixed @xmath2 and @xmath8 .",
    "however , instead of assuming a complicated functional form , we use a simple one at this stage .",
    "we leave such a complicated analysis for our future work . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a simple overall @xmath13 dependence is assumed @xcite : @xmath14(@xmath2 dependent function ) . here",
    ", we assume the same functional form .",
    "the weight function used for the following analysis is given by : @xmath15 where @xmath16 indicates the parton distribution type , and it is taken as @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 . among these parameters ,",
    "three parameters can be fixed by baryon - number , charge , and momentum conservations @xcite .",
    "the motivation is explained for choosing this functional form in ref .",
    "@xcite .      in the previous analysis ,",
    "the flavor number is limited to three .",
    "however , charm - quark distributions are important for practical applications . for example , charmonium productions are used for searching a quark - gluon plasma signature in heavy - ion reactions .",
    "the charm distributions are also important in neutrino reactions @xcite .",
    "therefore , we add nuclear charm - quark distributions into the analysis .    at @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the charm - quark mass , the running coupling constants for the flavor - number three and four should agree each other : @xmath23 . in the leading order ( lo )",
