    "there are many methods to study signals and many applications of that study . given its importance",
    ", one might conclude that there is little opportunity left for the development of totally new approaches to signals . yet in this paper we provide a new way to find periodicity and quasi - periodicity in signals .",
    "the method is based on sliding windows ( also known as time - delay reconstruction ) , which have been used extensively in both engineering applications and in dynamical systems .",
    "but it adds a new element not applied before , which comes from the new field of computational topology @xcite .",
    "persistent homology is a topological method for measuring the shapes of spaces and the features of functions .",
    "one of the most important applications of persistent homology is to point clouds @xcite , where shape is usually interpreted as the geometry of some implicit underlying object near which the point cloud is sampled .",
    "the simplest non - trivial example of this idea is a point cloud which has the shape of a circle , and this shape is captured with @xmath0-dimensional persistence .",
    "the challenge in applying the method is that noise can reduce the persistence , and not enough points can prevent the circular shape from appearing .",
    "it s also a challenge to deal with the fact that features come on all scale - levels and can be nested or in more complicated relationships . but",
    "this is what persistent homology is all about .",
    "the idea of applying @xmath0d persistence to study time series arose in our study of gene expression data @xcite .",
    "the first of these papers studied a variety of existing methods for finding periodicity in gene expression patterns .",
    "the motivation of that work was the search for gene regulatory networks ( more precisely , possible nodes of gene regulatory networks ) that control periodic processes in cells such as the cell division cycle , circadian rhythms , metabolic cycles and periodic patterning in biological development ( lateral roots and somites ) .",
    "the methods studied in @xcite were derived from a number of fields including astronomy , geometry , biology and statistics , and all were based on a direct study of the underlying signal in either physical or frequency space .",
    "the most successful methods are based on finding cosine - like behavior , a rather limited definition of periodicity .    in this paper and in @xcite",
    "we look instead at the shape of the sliding window point cloud , a totally different approach .",
    "of course the geometry of point clouds derived from other kinds of data like images has been studied before @xcite , but the current approach is quite different .",
    "our method understands periodicity as repetition of patterns , whatever these may be , and quantifies this reoccurrence as the degree of circularity / roundness in the generated point - cloud .",
    "thus , it is fundamentally agnostic .",
    "the sliding window , or time - delay embedding , has been used mostly in the study of dynamical systems to understand the nature of their attractors .",
    "takens theorem @xcite gives conditions under which a smooth attractor can be reconstructed from the observations of a function , with bounds related to those of the whitney embedding theorem .",
    "this methodology has in turn been employed to test for non - linearity and chaotic behavior in the dynamics of ecg - ekg , eeg and meg @xcite .",
    "it has been recently demonstrated by de silva et .",
    "@xcite that combining time - delay embeddings with topological methods provides a framework for parametrizing periodic systems .",
    "kantz and schreiber provide in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  1 ) a good source of examples of time delay embeddings used in real - world data sets .      in the above applications , little of the topology and",
    "none of the geometry of the resulting sliding window embedding has ever been used .",
    "the novelty of our approach lies in our use of this geometry and topology through persistent homology .",
    "we make this possible by showing that maximum persistence , as a measure of `` roundness '' of the point - cloud , occurs when the window size corresponds to the natural frequency of the signal .",
    "this means that @xmath0d persistence is an effective quantifier of periodicity and quasi - periodicity and can be used to infer properties of the signal .      in section [ motivation ]",
    "we show a motivating example to illustrate our perspective . in section [ background ]",
    "we give a general introduction to persistent homology .",
    "more on this topic can be found in @xcite . in section [ approximation ]",
    "we show that sliding windows behave well under approximations , and give explicit estimates at the point - cloud level .",
    "section [ trig ] is devoted to studying the geometric structure of sliding window embeddings from truncated fourier series , as well as their dependency on embedding dimension and window size . in section [ secpershomoltrunc ] we prove results describing the structure of persistent diagrams from sliding window embeddings .",
    "we present in section [ secexamples ] some examples of how our method applies in the problem of quantifying periodicity in time series data .",
    "suppose that @xmath1 is a function defined on an interval of the real numbers .",
    "choose an integer @xmath2 and a real number @xmath3 , both greater than @xmath4 .",
    "the sliding window embedding of @xmath1 based at @xmath5 into @xmath6 is the point @xmath7 choosing different values of @xmath8 gives a collection of points called a * sliding window point cloud for @xmath1*. a critical parameter for this embedding is the * window - size * @xmath9 .      to motivate the approach we take in the paper ,",
    "let us begin with the following example .",
    "let @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "then @xmath12 and therefore @xmath13 describes a planar curve in @xmath6 , with winding number @xmath14 , whenever @xmath15 and @xmath16 are linearly independent .",
    "one can in fact see how the shape of this curve changes as a function of @xmath14 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , let @xmath17 which can be computed using lagrange s trigonometric formulae @xmath18 it follows that @xmath19 is positive semi - definite ( both its determinant and trace ar non - negative ) .",
    "this means the eigenvalues of @xmath19 are non - negative and real : @xmath20 , and there is a @xmath21 orthogonal matrix @xmath22 so that @xmath23 therefore , if @xmath24 ( here @xmath25 denotes transpose ) then    @xmath26    since @xmath22 is a rotation matrix , say by an angle @xmath27 , then the map @xmath28 is an isometry .    in summary , for @xmath11",
    ", the embedding @xmath29 describes an ellipse on the plane @xmath30 , whose shape ( minor and major axes ) is determined by the square roots of the eigenvalues of @xmath19 .",
    "these eigenvalues can be computed explicitly as @xmath31 it follows that the ellipse is roundest when @xmath32 attains its maximum , which occurs if and only if @xmath33 . one such instance is @xmath34 which is when the window - size approximates the length of the period of @xmath35 . in other words ,",
    "the roundness of the sliding window point cloud for @xmath36 is maximized when the window - size is close to resonating with its natural frequency .",
    "the previous example provides the following intuition : for a generic function @xmath1 , the degree to which the image of @xmath37 traces a closed curve in @xmath6 reflects how periodic @xmath1 is .",
    "moreover , if @xmath1 is periodic , then the roundness of @xmath37 defined as the largest radius of a ball in @xmath6 so that the curve @xmath38 is tangent to at least two points of its equator , is maximized when the window - size @xmath9 approaches the period length .",
    "the goal of this paper is to understand these relations",
    ".    the geometry of the curve @xmath39 can be quite complicated , as shown in figure [ figsynthfunction ] .",
    "the 1-dimensional persistence diagram for the vietoris - rips filtration on a finite sample @xmath40 , on the other hand , is readily computable @xcite and its maximum persistence is a measure of roundness as defined in the previous paragraph .",
    "we will review in section [ background ] the basic concepts behind persistent homology , and devote the rest of the paper to understanding how the geometry of @xmath41 reflects properties of @xmath1 such as periodicity and period .      with this motivation in mind , we now describe our approach : as we have seen , understanding the algebraic properties of trigonometric functions allows one to characterize the geometry of @xmath41 when @xmath1 is a trigonometric polynomial .",
    "this understanding , in turn , can be bootstrapped using fourier analysis and stability of persistence diagrams , in an approximation step towards @xmath42 of a generic periodic function . in",
    "what follows , we will establish the appropriate continuity results for approximation , as well as the necessary structural results for persistence diagrams from sliding window point clouds .",

    "a simplicial map induces a homomorphism on homology , @xmath69 , and homotopic maps induce the same homomorphism .",
    "homotopy equivalences of spaces induce isomorphisms on homology .",
    "the simplicial approximation theorem tells us that a continuous map of simplicial complexes can be approximated by a simplicial map , so that it makes sense to talk about continuous maps inducing homomorphisms on homology .",

    "the reason why we have phrased the results in terms of the spaces @xmath191 is because it provides the following interpretation : if the function @xmath1 has certain degree of niceness , then one should expect the approximation of the persistence diagrams from @xmath41 by those of @xmath192 to improve at an explicit rate .",

    "each function is then evaluated at 50 evenly spaced time points , yielding the sampled signals @xmath574 $ ] which we input into the algorithms . for constructing the sliding window point clouds we use @xmath575 , coefficients in @xmath576 , @xmath577 and report the best score . in all the other algorithms we set the parameters to their",
    "suggested or default values .",
    "the results are summarized in figure [ figtestcases ] .",
    "two things are worth noting : first , except for the sliding windows method ( sw1pers ) , all other algorithms have clear preferences for the type of shape they consider to be most periodic .",
    "these biases are of course part of the wiring of the algorithms , and were to be expected .",
    "the second thing to notice has to do with the distribution of scores and their relative differences .",
    "methods such as jtk or lomb - scargle define their periodicity score in terms of @xmath44-values , which are extremely difficult to interpret .",
    "our scoring method , by way of contrast , has a clear geometric interpretation and a reasonable distribution .",
    "we compare the different algorithms by their ability to separate periodic from non - periodic signals .",
    "the performance of this type of binary classification can be visualized using a receiver operator characteristic ( roc ) plot , which compares the true positive rate ( tpr ) to the false positive rate ( fpr ) as a cutoff on the scores is varied .",
    "here the tpr is the proportion of correctly identified positive cases out of all positives , and fpr is the proportion of negative cases incorrectly identified as positives out of all the negatives .",
    "the line tpr = fpr is the performance of random guessing ; the higher the roc curve is above this line , the better its classification performance .",
    "an algorithm that is able to perfectly separate all positive from negative test cases would have a roc curve that passes through the point tpr=1 and fpr=0 .",
    "it follows that a reasonable measure of classification success for a particular method , is the area under its roc curves .",
    "the synthetic data is generated as follows : the periodic signals ( positive cases ) span two periods and include a cosine , cosine with trending , cosine with damping , and cosine with increased peak steepness .",
    "the non - periodic signals ( negative cases ) include a constant and a linear function .",
    "we generate 100 profiles from each shape by adjusting its phase .",
    "for instance , in the case of the cosine shape we let @xmath578 be the profiles .",
    "we sample each of the 600 profiles at 50 evenly spaced time points @xmath530 $ ] , and add gaussian noise with standard deviation at @xmath579 , @xmath580 and @xmath581 of the signal s amplitude .",
    "please refer to figure [ figsyntheticdata ] for examples .",
    "there are two reason why we regard constant functions as non - periodic . on the one hand ,",
    "the intended application for sw1pers ( sliding windows and 1-persistence scoring ) is to identify genes that are both relevant and exhibit a periodic expression pattern with respect to time .",
    "relevance in this case means that changes in expression - level translate into physiological phenomena .",
    "the second reason has to do with the philosophy of the proposed method : we quantify periodicity as the prominence of 1-homology classes in the sliding window point cloud .",
    "since this point cloud for a constant function is only a point , it does not have 1-homology and hence is interpreted as coming from a non - periodic function .",
    "for the sliding windows + 1d @xmath64-persistence computation we let @xmath575 , @xmath582 and @xmath583 . in order to address noise",
    ", we include a layer of ( simple ) moving average at the sampled signal level , and one iteration of mean - shift @xcite at the sliding window point cloud level . for the moving average we fix a window size with 7 data points , and use a cubic spline of this denoised signal to populate the point cloud .",
    "mean - shift on a pointwise centered and normalized point cloud @xmath567 was implemented as follows : given a point @xmath584 , we let @xmath585 be the mean of the set @xmath586 where @xmath587 and @xmath588 denotes the euclidean inner product of @xmath589 and @xmath590 . in other words , @xmath585 is the mean of the @xmath162-neighbors of @xmath589 if distance is measured with cosine similarity .",
    "we obtain the mean - shifted point cloud    @xmath591 which we now use for the persistent homology computation .",
    "we report our results in figure [ figroccurves ] .",
    "the lomb - scargle periodogram is considered to be one of the best methods for detecting periodicity , and its roc curves support this belief .",
    "the fact that it is attuned to favoring cosine - like curves makes it very resilient to dampening , trending and noise .",
    "it was thus a great surprise to see that our method performs comparably well in all cases , except for trended cosines and cosines , and that outperforms it for peaked and damped profiles at high noise levels .",
    "a final point we would like to make , is that denoising really is a crucial element of the sw1pers pipeline .",
    "we show in figure [ figroccurvesnodenoising ] the results of quantifying periodicity on the raw synthetic data , i.e. without applying denoising .",
    "as one can see , in the absence of pre - processing , the results degrade considerably .",
    "we prove in this paper results which describe the structure of persistence diagrams obtained by sliding window embeddings of time series . the main tools for the analysis were a fourier series approximation argument and the stability theorem for persistence diagrams .",
    "these results we obtained , provide explicit information about how diagrams from sliding window point clouds depend on the embedding dimension , window size and field of coefficients .",
    "we then present examples of the effectiveness of our method for quantifying periodicity of time series data . the experimental side of this framework will be explored more in depth in future work .",
    "this paper also presents the first full _ theoretical analysis _ of the use of persistent homology to find structure in time series data .",
    "time delay embeddings as a means to analyze signals is not new , rather it is a well - established method in dynamical systems and in image analysis . and",
    "the use of computation topology methods to find structure in transformed data has already been considered experimentally before , notably in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this paper , however , is the first to provide a theoretical analysis of the dependency of persistence on embedding dimension and window size .",
    "there are some interesting new aspects of the use of persistence in this method .",
    "it provides one of the first examples where persistent * homology * with coefficients other than @xmath523 is required .",
    "other notable examples include @xcite , where coefficients in @xmath524 were essential to discover the embedded klein bottle , and @xcite where the authors start with a 1d persistent * cohomology * class mod @xmath64 , and lift it to an integer 1d class to get a map to the circle .",
    "they do this by choosing @xmath44 so that the relevant homomorphism in the bockstein long exact sequence is surjective .",
    "their approach for real data is to choose a prime @xmath44 at random , and evaluate if @xmath592 has @xmath44-torsion .",
    "if it does , they then choose another prime .",
    "by contrast , we have established exactly which primes could be problematic and can avoid them in advance .",
    "it was highlighted in remark [ rmkmaxpersdist2diagonal ] that maximum persistence , the main feature for periodicity we study in this paper , satisfies @xmath593 .",
    "this is in fact part of a bigger picture : indeed , the @xmath594-wasserstein distance between two persistence diagrams @xmath80 and @xmath86 is defined by @xmath595 where @xmath88 is a matching of @xmath80 with @xmath81 . as with the bottleneck distance ( remark [ rmkmaxpersdist2diagonal ] ) one can show that @xmath596 and since @xmath597 as @xmath598 , then @xmath599 can be regarded as a smoother version of @xmath600 . when @xmath79 comes from a sliding window point cloud ,",
    "@xmath599 can be interpreted as a sequence of signatures , or features , for periodicity and other phenomena at the signal level . here",
    "the parameter @xmath594 serves as the level of smoothing , and as it gets lager , the emphasis in what @xmath601 measures shifts from topological noise and fine attributes to large topological events .",
    "the ring of algebraic functions on persistence diagrams , as a source of features for machine learning purposes , has been recently studied by adcock et .",
    "al . @xcite .",
    "we believe these and other signatures such as @xmath601 should uncover non - trivial signal properties captured by their sliding window point clouds .",
    "we have devoted this paper to exploring the use of @xmath600 , but we hope that in future work the list of useful features from persistence diagrams on sliding window point clouds can be extended .",
    "we also mention that section [ secfieldcoeff ] is the first explicit computation of the persistence diagram of a parametrized space .",
    "the method of fourier approximation presented here is one of the first in a much needed toolbox for explicit computations of persistence diagrams .",
    "our final comment is to point out that the fact that the size of the sliding window should match the period searched for was not obvious in advance . knowing this provides powerful information on sampling density to scientists planning an experiment that looks for periodic data , and lays the ground work for the use of sw1pers as a _ filter _ for time series data .    in future",
    "work we plan to establish our conjecture that @xmath600 is maximized by our choice of window size , and the main ingredient will be strengthening the lower bound presented in theorem [ thmwindsize2maxpers ] .",
    "we also plan to establish the filtering properties of sw1pers and apply it to a variety of data , including biological data like that from gene expression and physiology , astronomical data , and weather .",
    "finally , we plan to extend these methods by using other tools from topological data analysis to find structure and features in time series .",
