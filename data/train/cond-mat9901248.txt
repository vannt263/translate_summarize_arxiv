    "the classic kramers formulation of reaction rates in solution  @xcite and its generalization to non - markovian solvents  @xcite has provided many theoretical challenges over the past six decades  @xcite ) . in this formulation the reaction coordinate @xmath0 is modeled as evolving in a double - well potential @xmath1 with a barrier separating the reactant and product states .",
    "the solvent effects are modeled in terms of fluctuating and dissipative forces . a full understanding of the dependence of the rate coefficient @xmath2 on the dissipation in the markovian solvent limit ( the  turnover problem \" ) has only been achieved in the last few years  @xcite .",
    "comparably thorough understanding in the case of a non - markovian solvent is not yet available .",
    "understanding of the temperature dependence of @xmath2 is also far from complete  @xcite .",
    "clearly , there is yet a great deal to learn about this classic problem .    in the past two decades , and most especially in the past few years , attention has also been paid by a number of investigators to the time - dependence of the rate coefficient , that is , the way in which @xmath3 approaches its asymptotic value @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "this time dependence directly mirrors the dynamics of the reaction coordinate in the barrier region on the way toward capture by one well or the other .",
    "our focus is on this time dependence and the way that it is influenced by the parameters of the system .",
    "the generalized kramers problem is based on the dynamical equations for the reaction coordinate @xmath5 where a dot denotes a time derivative , @xmath6 is an effective potential related to @xmath1 ( cf .",
    "next section ) , @xmath7 is the dissipative memory kernel ( which we will often simply call the _ memory kernel _ ) , and @xmath8 represents gaussian fluctuations that satisfy the fluctuation - dissipation relation @xmath9 the brackets @xmath10 denote an ensemble average , @xmath11 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath12 is the temperature .",
    "the fluctuations and dissipation account for the interaction of the reaction coordinate with the surrounding medium .",
    "the original kramers problem dealt with a markovian solvent , that is , with instantaneous dissipation : @xmath13 the parameter @xmath14 is the dissipation parameter or damping parameter .",
    "generalizations to the non - markovian problem have typically focused on exponential memory kernels  @xcite , @xmath15 and on oscillatory memory kernels  @xcite , @xmath16 ( this memory kernel and the parameters in it will be discussed in detail in the next section ) .",
    "another generalization , which we do not address in our work , deals with gaussian memory kernels  @xcite , @xmath17 in all of these generalizations @xmath18 is a measure of the decay time of the memory kernel or , equivalently , of the correlation time of the fluctuations .    in subsequent sections",
    "we will provide a brief graphic review of the results addressed in our previous work , which succinctly are as follows .",
    "the time - dependent rate coefficient for the markovian solvent at high damping ( that is , beyond the  turnover \" regime ) decays monotonically towards its equilibrium value  @xcite . for the exponential memory at",
    "high damping there are _ two _ distinct types of time dependences , the  non - adiabatic \" , in which the rate coefficient decays monotonically to its equilibrium value ( as in the markovian case ) , and the  caging \" , in which the decay to equilibrium is oscillatory with a frequency characteristic of an effective caging potential  @xcite . at very low damping ( that is , below the  turnover \" ) , the decay of the rate coefficient to its equilibrium value is again oscillatory , but now with a frequency characteristic of the bistable potential .",
    "this behavior is apparent for the markovian solvent  @xcite and also for the exponential memory  @xcite in this energy - diffusion - limited regime .",
    "we have shown that the theoretical predictions agree very well with numerical simulations for all of these generic behaviors .    in this paper",
    "we complete our analysis with a study of the oscillatory memory kernel . in appropriate limits",
    "we recover the typical low - damping behavior of the rate coefficient and also the high - damping non - adiabatic monotonic behavior , although caging , as we will see , can not be achieved with an oscillatory memory .",
    "most interesting , perhaps , is the appearance of a new time dependence different from those previously observed or anticipated .",
    "this new time dependence is a consequence of the new features of the memory kernel such as the fact that it alternates between positive and negative values .",
    "we will present and explain this new behavior , and determine the parameter regimes where it may be observed .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ themodel ] we introduce the model eq .",
    "( [ generic1 ] ) in detail .",
    "in fact , we present two equivalent versions of the model .",
    "one version invokes a solvent coordinate which is coupled to the reaction coordinate and also coupled to a heat bath .",
    "this double presentation not only clarifies the physical origin of the oscillatory memory kernel , but it also leads to more transparent interpretation of the resulting time dependence of the rate coefficient . in sec .",
    "[ simul ] we describe our simulations and numerical procedures .",
    "section  [ results ] presents a graphical summary of the various time dependences obtained numerically in earlier work and provides a context for the presentation of the new behavior identified in the oscillatory memory system . in sec .",
    "[ approximations ] we discuss analytic approximations that serve as a backdrop for our analysis and detailed explanation of the new behavior , which is presented in sec .  [ newreg ] .",
    "the results and conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "[ concl ] .",
    "we first present an alternative ( two - variable ) model that eventually leads to eq .",
    "( [ generic1 ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ oscillatory ] ) .",
    "the potential energy of the two - variable model is @xmath19 where the solvent is explicitly represented by a harmonic coordinate @xmath20 .",
    "the reaction coordinate @xmath21 evolves in a bistable potential that is taken to be of the familiar form @xmath22 we take @xmath23 as the energy unit throughout this work and thus set it equal to unity .",
    "the reaction coordinate is coupled to the solvent coordinate via a harmonic spring of force constant @xmath2 .",
    "the dynamical equations for the coupled system , assuming that @xmath20 is coupled to a heat bath at temperature @xmath12 , are @xmath24 here @xmath14 is the friction coefficient for the solvent coordinate and @xmath25 represents @xmath26-correlated gaussian fluctuations that satisfy the fluctuation - dissipation relation @xmath27 throughout we take the barrier height to be large compared to the temperature , @xmath28 .",
    "we call eq .",
    "( [ eqext ] ) the  extended \" representation of our system .",
    "although the extended model can readily be integrated numerically , initial conditions are not arbitrary and require careful consideration .",
    "the reduction of the model ( [ eqext ] ) to the generalized kramers problem ( [ generic1 ] ) with the fluctuation - dissipation relation ( [ cornoise ] ) requires distributions for the initial solvent coordinate @xmath29 and velocity @xmath30 that satisfy certain conditions ( cf . appendix  [ appa ] , where these initial conditions are presented in detail ) .    a number of theoretical approaches to this problem deal ,",
    "instead , with the completely equivalent  contracted \" or  reduced \" representation obtained by explicitly integrating out the solvent coordinate @xmath20 . among these",
    "is the work of grote and hynes  @xcite and that of kohen and tannor ( kt ) @xcite . the resulting equivalent single - variable problem is shown in appendix[appa ] to be given by eq .",
    "( [ generic1 ] ) with the effective potential @xmath31 depending on the relative values of parameters , the resulting memory kernel can decay monotonically (  hyperbolic \" case ) or it can decay in an oscillatory fashion (  trigonometric \" case ) .",
    "we are specifically interested in the trigonometric case , which requires that @xmath32 the associated memory kernel is @xmath33 with the frequency @xmath34 we expect that the oscillatory character of the memory kernel may lead to new regimes of dynamical behavior that will become evident in the time dependence of the rate coefficient .",
    "we do not pursue the hyperbolic case because we expect behavior similar to that found earlier for the exponential memory kernel and hence do not expect new behaviors in this case .",
    "= 4.in    from the explicit form ( [ efbistable ] ) of the effective potential",
    "we see that the additional quadratic term moves the minima of the wells of the bistable potential @xmath1 from @xmath35 to @xmath36 and diminishes the barrier from @xmath37 to @xmath38 both effects can be seen in fig .",
    "it is easily shown that the barrier disappears entirely when @xmath39 , at which point the very nature of the problem changes .",
    "we thus constrain our parameters @xmath2 and @xmath40 to ensure bistability : @xmath41    to summarize , then , the model to be considered in this paper is given by eqs .",
    "( [ eqext ] ) with the potential ( [ bistable ] ) and the fluctuation - dissipation relation ( [ fdr1 ] ) ( extended representation ) , or , completely equivalently , by eq .",
    "( [ generic1 ] ) with the effective potential ( [ efbistable ] ) , the memory kernel ( [ trigfric ] ) , and the fluctuation - dissipation relation ( [ cornoise ] ) ( reduced representation ) .",
    "whichever formulation is used , our parameters are constrained by the inequality ( [ cons1 ] ) , which ensures a bistable effective potential , and by the inequality ( [ und ] ) , which ensures an oscillatory memory kernel . for some purposes the extended representation provides a more convenient viewpoint , while for others the reduced representation is more transparent . in particular , we find the extended representation more convenient for numerical simulations .    as a final point in this section it is important to note the altered significance of parameters in the oscillatory memory kernel compared to the markovian or exponential models .",
    "in the latter two cases  high friction \" and  low friction \" refer to the value of @xmath14 since this parameter directly measures the strength of the dissipative force that extracts energy from the reaction coordinate into the bath .",
    "thus , in the exponential memory case @xmath14 is the value of @xmath42 and also of the integrated memory kernel . in the case under consideration here , however , @xmath14 is a measure of the dissipative force on the _ solvent _ coordinate and not directly on the reaction coordinate .",
    "although @xmath14 indirectly affects the loss of energy of the reaction coordinate , the energy loss channel is now principally determined by the coupling strength between the reaction coordinate and the solvent coordinate . correspondingly , now @xmath43 .",
    "the integrated memory kernel is @xmath44 , thus reflecting the overall influence of @xmath14 .",
    "however , it is the coupling constant @xmath2 that now essentially determines whether we are in the  high friction \" or  low friction \" regime ( more details will be presented in sec .  [ results ] ) .",
    "the quantity of interest is the time - dependent rate coefficient @xmath3 for an ensemble of particles evolving according to @xmath0 in eq .",
    "( [ generic1 ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ eqext ] ) .",
    "numerically we find it more convenient to work with the extended system ( [ eqext ] ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath3 is the time - dependent mean rate of passage of the particles across the barrier at @xmath45 .",
    "the usual focus on the deviation of @xmath3 from its equilibrium transition state theory ( tst ) value  @xcite leads to the expression @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the transition state theory rate that assumes that particles never recross the barrier .",
    "the transmission coefficient @xmath48 is the correction to transition state theory that includes both the temporal dynamics and the effects of those particles that do recross the barrier .",
    "we are interested in the dynamics of the transmission coefficient @xmath48 .",
    "numerically , one might try to calculate @xmath3 directly by starting all the particles in one well and computing at each time how many of them have crossed to the other well .",
    "it would require an exceedingly long calculation to gather statistically significant data in this manner , since the reaction barrier is very much higher than the thermal fluctuations .",
    "the reactive flux formalism  @xcite that relies on eq .",
    "( [ tst ] ) overcomes this difficulty since the transmission coefficient can be calculated by dealing only with an ensemble of particles whose initial position is above the barrier [ @xmath49 . the slow process of  getting there \" is already included in @xmath50 .",
    "half of the particles that start above the barrier have a positive velocity distributed according to the boltzmann distribution in energy , and the other half have the same distribution but with negative velocities .",
    "upon imposing the initial conditions on @xmath20 discussed in appendix  [ appa ] , we run quite a few iterations for the solvent coordinate evolution in order to obtain even better thermalization .",
    "having achieved this , we then integrate the fully coupled system ( [ eqext ] ) with the following distributions for the initial reaction coordinate position @xmath51 and initial velocity @xmath52 : @xmath53 @xmath54    the numerical integration is carried out using the second order heun s algorithm  @xcite . in all our runs our ensemble consists of @xmath55 particles and we use a very small time step ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the transmission coefficient is calculated from these simulated data according to the relation  @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the particles that started with positive velocities and negative velocities respectively and at time @xmath60 are in or over the right hand well ( i.e. , the particles for which @xmath61 ) . alternatively and completely",
    "equivalently ( via a simple symmetry argument ) one can start all the @xmath21 particles with a positive velocity and then @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the fraction of particles that are in or over the right hand well at time @xmath60 , and @xmath64 is the fraction in or over the left hand well .",
    "furthermore , it is easily argued that  @xcite @xmath65 so it is sufficient to follow one or the other .",
    "= 5.in    the number of independent parameters in the generalized kramers problem with an oscillatory memory kernel is of course larger than for markovian or exponential frictions .",
    "the values of @xmath48 and @xmath66 now in general depend on @xmath2 , @xmath40 , @xmath14 , and @xmath67 .",
    "indeed , a systematic , even qualitative study of the transmission coefficient as was done , for example , in  @xcite would be quite complex .",
    "we focus on a more modest goal , that is , to capture qualitatively the different types of temporal behavior of @xmath48 and the broad parameter regimes where each occurs .",
    "these include the three regimes identified for the exponential memory , namely , the energy - diffusion - limited , the non - adiabatic , and the caging regimes , as well as possible new behaviors .",
    "the oscillatory memory kernel can exhibit different appearances depending on the parameter choices .",
    "figure  [ diffric ] exhibits three distinct  generic \" appearances , each roughly representative of a distinct parameter regime .",
    "two of these mimic behaviors of the exponential memory kernel and might be expected to lead to transmission coefficients similar to those obtained earlier .",
    "the third , the strongly oscillatory kernel , is new and might be expected to lead to new behavior .",
    "let us consider each case in turn , along with the resulting transmission coefficients .",
    "the solid curve kernel in fig .  [ diffric ] mimics the exponential memory kernel in the energy - diffusion - limited regime .",
    "the kernel @xmath68 is small at all times . in the case of the exponential memory kernel ( [ expmem ] ) this behavior was insured by choosing @xmath14 to be small , but in the oscillatory memory case , as noted earlier , the meaning of the parameters is different .",
    "now a small value of @xmath68 and , in particular , a small value of @xmath42 is insured if we choose small values of @xmath69 , that is , @xmath2 must be small and/or @xmath40 must be large .",
    "note that the choices must still obey the constraint ( [ cons1 ] ) , but this is not a problem .",
    "the value of @xmath14 is not constrained by the low friction requirement , but it _ is _ constrained by eq .",
    "( [ und ] ) if we want to insure that we are in the oscillatory regime .",
    "the value of @xmath14 determines the oscillation frequency of the memory kernel @xmath68 but not its magnitude .",
    "= 5.in    typical values of the parameters that satisfy the conditions to produce energy - diffusion - limited behavior while preserving the oscillatory character of the memory kernel are @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "these are the values used to produce the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ diffric ] . in this regime",
    "the low dissipation causes the dynamics of the system to be dominated by the slow variation of the energy and consequently by the repeated inertial recrossing of the barrier before the particles are trapped in one well or the other .",
    "as expected , we find the typical energy - diffusion - limited behavior for @xmath48 ( oscillatory curve in fig .",
    "[ ktag ] ) that consists of a very small initial decay to a plateau up to a time beyond which @xmath48 decays in an oscillatory manner to its equilibrium value .",
    "as shown and discussed in our earlier work  @xcite , the first decay is due to the few low - energy particles that immediately change their initial direction due to a thermal fluctuation and are trapped in the well opposite to the one toward which they were initially moving .",
    "the oscillations are associated with the essentially inertial successive recrossings of the higher - energy particles .",
    "all the arguments developed in the reduced system should have a counterpart in the extended scheme . in the energy - diffusion - limited case we have considered small @xmath2 , large @xmath40 , and arbitrary @xmath14 [ subject to the constraint ( [ und ] ) ] .",
    "large @xmath40 leads to a narrow harmonic potential for @xmath20 [ and consequently @xmath73 remains small ] , and small @xmath2 means weak coupling . since the coupling term @xmath74 in eqs .",
    "( [ eqext ] ) provides the only energy loss channel for the @xmath21 coordinate , large @xmath40 and small @xmath2 therefore lead to low dissipation .",
    "let us now move on to the high dissipation regime .",
    "the dashed curve in fig .  [ diffric ] mimics the exponential memory kernel in the diffusion - limited regime .",
    "the kernel @xmath68 has a high initial value and decays essentially monotonically ( although we _ are _ in the oscillatory regime ) . in the case of the exponential memory kernel ( [ expmem ] )",
    "this regime results when @xmath14 is large . for the exponential memory kernel ,",
    "the choice of the second parameter , @xmath18 , further determines two different regimes of behavior .",
    "if the correlation time @xmath18 is small , such that @xmath75 , the transmission coefficient decays monotonically and one is said to be in the non - adiabatic regime .",
    "this is also the unique high - dissipation behavior associated with the markovian problem . on the other hand , if @xmath18 is small , such that @xmath76 , one is in the caging regime in which the behavior of the transmission coefficient is oscillatory ( but quite differently so than in the low dissipation regime ) .",
    "the quasi - exponential dashed memory kernel in fig .",
    "[ diffric ] corresponds to the non - adiabatic behavior since the ratio of the initial value ( about 0.8 ) to the decay time of the kernel ( about 4.0 ) is clearly smaller than unity . in order to have the oscillatory memory mimic the non - adiabatic exponential memory case as in the figure we require @xmath14 to be _ small",
    "_ ( since now @xmath14 plays the role that @xmath77 did before ) , and @xmath78 to be small as well ( to minimize oscillatory effects ) .",
    "a typical set of values that meets these various conditions is @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 , which leads to @xmath82 .",
    "the associated transmission coefficient for these parameters exhibits the typical features of the non - adiabatic regime , as shown by the monotonic curve in fig .",
    "[ ktag ] , namely , a smooth rather rapid decay to the equilibrium value . as in the case of an exponential memory , this decay in the non - adiabatic regime",
    "looks gaussian rather than exponential at short times .    in the extended system",
    "small @xmath40 means that the potential in @xmath20 is very wide and for this reason @xmath73 easily achieves large values .",
    "large @xmath2 represents strong coupling , and the combination of both conditions leads to high dissipation for the @xmath21 coordinate .",
    "as noted above , the other regime found for an exponential memory kernel with high dissipation is the caging regime , which there occurs when both @xmath14 and @xmath18 are large , with @xmath83 .",
    "interestingly , the constraints on the parameters and the shape of the oscillatory friction kernel do not admit this regime . this can be understood from the following argument .",
    "caging is achieved when @xmath68 is essentially constant over some substantial time range so that the friction integral in eq .",
    "( [ generic1 ] ) over this time can be approximated as a linear force on @xmath0 and such that the resulting potential becomes monostable . in our case",
    ", this resulting potential @xmath84 would be @xmath85 from this expression it is easy to deduce that the potential @xmath84 loses its barrier when @xmath86 .",
    "the combination of the condition that @xmath68 behave roughly as a constant for some time interval ( @xmath14 small ) and that the resulting potential lose its barrier during this time ( @xmath87 ) would lead to a caging regime with effective caging potential frequency @xmath88 . however , this combination of conditions can not be satisfied with an oscillatory memory .",
    "if we increase the value of @xmath2 above @xmath89 , we also have to increase @xmath14 ( @xmath78 has to remain small to avoid pronounced oscillations ) , but this in turn leads to the rapid exponential decay of @xmath68 .",
    "it is thus not possible to achieve the conditions for the caging regime with trigonometric oscillatory friction .",
    "the caging regime is easily captured in the hyperbolic case ( cf .",
    "appendix  [ appa ] ) , since then @xmath68 can take on a very high initial value that can be sustained for a long time .",
    "we have thus seen that the form of @xmath68 and the constraints on @xmath2 , @xmath40 , and @xmath14 determine which regimes typical of exponential memories can also be captured with an oscillatory memory .",
    "the requirements described so far have been met by either choosing @xmath42 to be small ( low dissipation ) or large ( high dissipation ) while minimizing the amplitude of the oscillations .    _",
    "new behaviors _ for the dynamics of @xmath48 may appear in parameter regimes that emphasize the oscillatory behavior of @xmath68 . to provide such emphasis",
    "we minimize the damping effects of the exponential part by choosing @xmath14 to be small .",
    "further choosing a very small value for @xmath40 and a medium value for @xmath2 ( large enough to get high amplitudes of oscillation of @xmath68 , but limited so that the frequency @xmath78 is not too high ) we obtain the oscillatory friction shown as the dotted kernel in fig .",
    "[ diffric ] .",
    "since @xmath14 and @xmath40 are very small , the frequency of the oscillations is @xmath90 in this regime at low temperatures an entirely new temporal behavior emerges for @xmath48 .",
    "we generically call this the  stair - like \" regime .",
    "it is shown for a typical set of parameter values in fig .",
    "[ ktag ] ( corresponding to those of the dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ diffric ] ) .",

    "the explanation of this behavior , including the period of the steps , the dependences on the parameters @xmath14 , @xmath40 , @xmath2 , and @xmath67 , and the connections with the other regimes are presented in detail in sec .",
    "[ newreg ] .",
    "in this section we lay the groundwork for the arguments invoked in the next section , where we discuss the stair - like regime in detail .",
    "our explanations are semi - quantitative , that is , we do not develop a theory that reproduces the stair - like curve in the figure in all its details .",
    "we mention this because in fact such theories _ are _ available for the two other curves  @xcite . in the high dissipation regime",
    "the kt theory predicts the monotonic decay in the non - adiabatic regime , and this prediction , shown in fig .",
    "[ ktag ] , is seen to be quantitatively very good ( see also  @xcite ) . in the low dissipation regime",
    "we have shown that our theory also leads to very good quantitative agreement with numerical results for the entire time evolution of @xmath48  @xcite .",
    "we have not derived such a detailed formula for the stair - like regime , but we nevertheless have been able to gain considerable understanding of this behavior , and this is what we shall present .",
    "our insights turn out to be most complete if we invoke both representations of the oscillatory problem , the extended as well as the reduced .",
    "furthermore , an understanding of the early time dependence of @xmath48 in both of these representations turns out to be very helpful , even if the approximations that are invoked are not valid over the entire time regime  the breakdown of approximations can also yield useful insights .",
    "we thus first turn to the early time behavior .",
    "consider first the reduced representation .",
    "kt theory focuses on the way in which particles subject to dynamics of the generic form ( [ generic1 ] ) with the potential approximated by a parabolic barrier diffuse to one side or the other of the barrier . since their analysis is restricted to a parabolic barrier ( rather than a bistable potential ) , the theory is appropriate only for high dissipation , that is , when the reaction coordinate never recrosses the barrier once it has left the barrier region . in other cases",
    "kt theory may ( and indeed does ) capture only the initial decay , typically up to the first plateau value of @xmath48 , but it does not capture the asymptotic values @xmath66 .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "[ ktag ] , where the kt theory predictions are shown for each of the generic transmission coefficients .",
    "kt theory works very well for all times for the non - adiabatic high dissipation curve , and captures the initial decay in the energy - diffusion - limited ( dashed curve ) and stair - like ( dot - dashed curve ) cases .",

    "= 3.0 in = 3.0 in    consider now the extended representation ( [ eqext ] ) .",
    "we introduce an even simpler approximation in this representation that also captures the early time behavior when the dissipation of energy in the @xmath21-coordinate is slow and that facilitates our analysis of the stair - like regime .",
    "the approximation is based on three main assumptions , all appropriate only at short times .",
    "one is akin to the argument we used earlier in the energy - diffusion - limited problem , namely , that the main influence of the temperature arises from the initial thermal distributions .",
    "thus , as long as the initial distributions are chosen correctly , that is , according to eqs .",
    "( [ y0 ] ) , ( [ vy0 ] ) , ( [ x0 ] ) , and ( [ vx0 ] ) , the thermal effects in the form of the explicit random force acting on the solvent coordinate can be omitted from the dynamical equations .",
    "the second is the omission of the dissipation term , i.e. , we set @xmath14 to zero . note that this is the dissipative force on the solvent coordinate ; the principal initial dissipative channel for the reaction coordinate @xmath0 is its coupling to the @xmath20 coordinate via @xmath2 , and this is retained .",
    "the third is to use a parabolic barrier to approximate the potential . with these assumptions",
    "the initial decay of the transmission coefficient is due to the low - energy particles ( i.e. those barely above the barrier ) that are pulled by the @xmath20 coordinate in a direction opposite to the one indicated by their initial velocity , as described by the simplified deterministic coupled linear equations @xmath91 with the initial distributions ( [ y0 ] ) , ( [ vy0 ] ) , ( [ x0 ] ) and ( [ vx0 ] ) we can then use the form eq .",

    "we saw in sec .",
    "[ results ] that the stair - like regime is achieved when @xmath14 and @xmath40 are small and the temperature is low .",

    "[ diftraj ] , the trajectories in the stair - like regime are considerably more complex  this complexity distinguishes the stair - like dynamics from the other regimes . for example , in this new regime one finds @xmath21-particles that remain localized over one well ( even though they have sufficient energy to cross the barrier ) and that after circling there several times may suddenly recross the barrier .",
    "this behavior is not found in any other regime studied so far .",
    "studying additional @xmath21-trajectories besides those shown explicitly in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ diftraj ] leads to the realization of a number of important points .",
    "first , we note that    * the @xmath21-particles cross the barrier only at certain specific times .    for our typical parameters ,",
    "these times are @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 ( approximately ) , which coincide with the decay times @xmath108 for the associated @xmath48 in fig .",
    "moreover , since we are working with low temperatures , the energy of the @xmath21-particles is typically not large enough to recross the barrier many times .",
    "actually , we have observed that    * most of the @xmath21-particles that cross the barrier do it only once .",
    "indeed , only about @xmath109 of the particles show multiple recrossings in our typical example .",
    "the fact that most particles do not return to their original well once they have crossed the barrier leads to    * steps rather than oscillations .",
    "on the other hand , small friction leads to very slow energy loss , and it is for this reason that    * even at long times crossing the barrier is still possible .",
    "this combination of features characteristic of the energy - diffusion - limited and non - adiabatic regimes ultimately leads to the    * appearance of successive steps and plateaus .",
    "at this point there are two obvious questions about this regime : i ) why do we see decays only at fairly sharply defined specific times and what are these times ?",
    "in other words , how is the period @xmath108 determined ?",
    "ii ) what determines the depth of each decay ?",
    "the answers to these and other questions are given in the following subsections by considering the effects of varying the parameters of our model .",
    "however , before going ahead , we should first understand how an @xmath21-particle can be trapped in one well in spite of having enough energy to cross the barrier , as well as how an @xmath21-particle can cross the barrier seemingly without having enough energy to do it .",
    "the reason for both strange situations is that the behavior of the @xmath21-particles may depend strongly on that of their associated @xmath20-oscillators .",
    "a given @xmath21-particle with energy greater than the barrier height can be  trapped \" in one well because each time it goes toward the barrier its coupled oscillator pulls it back .",
    "conversely , a given @xmath21-particle with apparently insufficient energy can cross the barrier by being pulled by its @xmath20 oscillator .",
    "thus , the coupling between @xmath21 and @xmath20 may determine the times at which the particles cross the barrier and therefore the times for the decays of @xmath48 .      to deduce the role of the coupling constant @xmath2 , we depart from our typical value ( @xmath110 ) and consider the trajectories for two cases on either side of this value but that still essentially preserve the stair - like behavior .",
    "we call them the large-@xmath2 case ( @xmath111 ) and the small-@xmath2 case ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath2 determines the extent to which @xmath21 and @xmath20 particle dynamics are in synchrony .    since @xmath48 contains information averaged over ensembles of particles , we are interested in the average trajectories of both @xmath21 and @xmath20 coordinates .",
    "we thus plot @xmath113 and @xmath114 , where @xmath10 here means an average over all the particles that are in the right well ( @xmath94 ) at each given time .",
    "[ trajsmallk ] shows averaged trajectories for the small-@xmath2 ( left panel ) and large-@xmath2 ( right panel ) cases .",
    "= 3.0 in = 3.0 in    for the small-@xmath2 case we readily observe that the motion of @xmath0 and @xmath73 are essentially uncorrelated .",
    "each dynamics proceeds with a different principal frequency of oscillation .",
    "a fourier analysis of the trajectories reveals that the peak frequency for @xmath0 is @xmath115 while that of @xmath73 is @xmath116 .",
    "these frequencies can be associated with two characteristic frequencies of our problem . that of @xmath0 corresponds to the frequency of the particle in the bistable potential , namely @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is roughly the average semiorbit time for an ensemble of particles above the barrier in the double - well potential . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have shown that the semiorbit time for a particle at an energy @xmath119 above the barrier is @xmath120 .",
    "an average of this time over a thermal distribution then directly yields @xmath121 .",
    "the frequency of @xmath73 , on the other hand , coincides with the frequency of @xmath68 , namely @xmath122 .",
    "this frequency characterizes the motion of @xmath73 in the second equation for the extended system , eq .",
    "( [ eqext ] ) , when the coupling contribution is neglected [ see also eq .",
    "( [ detext ] ) ] .",
    "the @xmath21-particles can cross the barrier with frequency @xmath123 since they do not care where their associated @xmath20-particles are .",
    "thus in this weakly coupled regime @xmath124    the large-@xmath2 case exhibits a different behavior . in this case @xmath0 and @xmath73 are essentially synchronized .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "[ trajsmallk ] that @xmath0 has two characteristic periods : a shorter one associated with motion in the bistable potential ( @xmath123 ) and a longer one that matches that of @xmath73 .",
    "the frequency of the latter is @xmath125 and coincides with @xmath126 .",
    "thus , the motion of @xmath21 is now dominated by the dynamics of its coupled oscillator .",
    "the consequence of the strong coupling is that now @xmath127    = 3.0 in = 3.0 in    these ideas can be further supported by considering the two - variable potential , eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) , drawn in contour form in fig .",
    "[ contourzb ] for the small-@xmath2 ( left panel ) and large-@xmath2 ( right panel ) cases .",
    "these plots clearly illustrate the correlations between @xmath21 and @xmath20 ( or the lack thereof ) .",
    "when the system is in one of the two two - dimensional wells , @xmath21 and @xmath20 remain more tightly bound in the large-@xmath2 case than in the small-@xmath2 case . in particular , when @xmath2 is small the @xmath20-particle can move away from @xmath21 even when the system has already fallen into one well .    further , consider the likely pathways followed by the system as it crosses , say , from the right to the left . in the small-@xmath2 case",
    "the likely path is for @xmath20 to decrease first ( perhaps even to negative values ) , followed by a change of @xmath21 from @xmath94 to @xmath96 . on the other hand , in the large-@xmath2 case",
    "it is easier for @xmath21 to first move from @xmath94 to @xmath96 to be followed by @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , in the large-@xmath2 case the crossing rate is determined by the frequency of @xmath73 so that @xmath128 ; in the small-@xmath2 case the crossing rate is limited by the motion of @xmath0 and hence @xmath129 .",
    "figure  [ difk ] shows the time - dependent transmission coefficient for the two cases .",
    "the times @xmath130 ( small-@xmath2 case ) and @xmath131 ( large-@xmath2 case ) obtained from the above arguments are consistent with the steps in the figure ( measured from mid - point to mid - point ) , most clearly in the length of the first step .",

    "[ difk ] illustrates the @xmath2-dependence of the depths of the steps in the stair - like transmission coefficient .",
    "the steps are clearly deeper when @xmath2 is small .",
    "the reason for this is that the total system loses energy by dissipation only through the @xmath20 coordinate .",
    "although both cases in the figure correspond to the same value of @xmath14 , the @xmath21-particles can retain energy for a longer time when @xmath2 is small .",
    "this allows more @xmath21-particles to cross the barrier , and it allows them to do so at later times .",
    "the deeper and more numerous clear steps in the small-@xmath2 case are a direct manifestation of these features .",
    "two further points should be noted .",
    "one is the symmetry of the semiorbit time @xmath132 with respect to @xmath119 .",
    "that is , the semiorbit time of a particle with an energy @xmath119 _ above _ the barrier is the same as the orbit time of a particle with energy @xmath119 _ below _ the barrier ( for small @xmath119 ) .",
    "this symmetry is important because it allows particles to remain in synchrony ; otherwise the steps in @xmath48 would be blurred .",
    "the other point is the dependence of @xmath48 and consequently of the period @xmath108 on barrier height . in general ,",
    "@xmath133 ( which reduces to our previous expression when @xmath134 ) , and an average of @xmath132 over a thermal distribution of particles above the barrier yields the generalization of eq .  ( [ weakly ] ) @xmath135 the right panel in fig .",
    "[ difk ] shows the transmission coefficient in the small-@xmath2 case for three values of the barrier height .",
    "the corresponding period estimates for @xmath136 obtained from eq .",

    "these decreasing periods with increasing barrier height are clearly consistent with the numerical results .",
    "we have seen that successive steps in the transmission coefficient arise because the particles lose their energy slowly .",
    "this requires @xmath14 to be small  but not too small ( cf .",

    "if @xmath14 is decreased we expect particles to lose their energy even more slowly , which leads to a larger number of deeper steps . however , as @xmath14 continues to decrease we expect to begin to see particles that cross the barrier more than once before becoming trapped .",
    "this leads to oscillations in @xmath48 and , eventually , to energy - diffusion - limited behavior .",
    "deeper steps and the first appearance of small oscillations with decreasing @xmath14 are clearly evident in the left panel of fig.[difgam ] .",
    "conversely , if @xmath14 is increased , particles lose their energy more rapidly , and fewer particles cross the barrier at all ; those that do so cross at most once .",
    "in this case , as seen in fig .",
    "[ difgam ] , the steps are less deep and almost disappear at long times .",
    "indeed , the limit of the stair - like behavior with increasing @xmath14 is the monotonic non - adiabatic regime , where only a few particles cross the barrier and they do so at very short times .",
    "= 3.0 in = 3.0 in      finally , we consider the temperature dependence of the transmission coefficient in the stair - like regime . as temperature",
    "is increased , all else remaining the same , there is a greater number of more energetic @xmath21-particles above the barrier .",
    "two aspects of their behavior dominate the resulting transmission coefficient .",
    "one is that the particles now have a greater range of semiorbit times @xmath132 ; the other , more important , effect is that particles are now sufficiently energetic that they can recross the barrier more than once .",

    "we should note the deeper first decay in the @xmath140 curve than observed in our earlier illustrations .",
    "this is due to the fact that here we have chosen @xmath40 to be very small ( a requirement for the stair - like regime ) .",
    "this causes the initial thermal distribution of @xmath29 to pull back @xmath21-particles more effectively than in our earlier example , and this in turn leads to the deeper decay .      since the extended [ eq .  ( [ eqext ] ) ] and reduced [ eq .  ( [ generic1 ] ) ]",
    "systems are entirely equivalent , it is of course possible to explain the new stair - like regime in terms of quantities and equations associated with the reduced representation .",

    "to cross the barrier , an @xmath21-particle must be moving towards @xmath45 .",
    "when @xmath2 is small , the dynamics of @xmath21 as it moves in the barrier region is thus dominated by the bistable potential @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , the decay periods in @xmath48 are determined by the frequency of the particles moving in the bistable potential with energies slightly larger and slightly smaller than the barrier height , which directly leads again to the earlier estimate @xmath143 [ cf .",

    "the slow dissipation of @xmath21-energy associated with small @xmath2 allows for many deep steps in @xmath48 .    as @xmath2 increases",

    "the temperature dependence can also be understood : for a given ( low ) @xmath14 , increasing the temperature leads to a greater number of particles above the barrier that can recross more than once before becoming trapped .",
