    "structural data of large - scale biological networks such as gene regulatory networks @xcite , protein - protein interaction networks @xcite , and metabolic networks @xcite have been accumulated by the active investigations in recent years , and heterogeneous connectivity , which means that a few nodes integrate a great number of nodes and most of the remaining nodes do not , are ubiquitously found as a striking property of the structures @xcite .",
    "heterogeneity exhibits the scale - free feature @xcite , and differs from homogenous connectivity , which means that most nodes have the same degree ( number of edges ) , is observed in classical network models such as regular lattices and the erds - rnyi random network @xcite .",
    "the scale - free feature is in degree distribution , defined as the probability of the existence nodes with degree @xmath0 , which follows the power law , @xmath1 with @xmath2 . since the scale - free feature is independent of living species @xcite , growth mechanism which can generate such statistical properties are paid much attention , and are expected to elucidate the evolutionary and growing processes of the networks .    in previous works ,",
    "the barabsi - albert ( ba ) model @xcite is well - known as a model for scale - free networks , and is frequently embedded among variety of mathematical models @xcite . using the growth mechanism by adding new nodes with preferential attachment ( pa ) which means that high - degree nodes get an even better chance to attract new edges , the ba model generates scale - free networks which indicate power - law degree distributions with the fixed degree exponent @xmath3 ; thus @xmath4 @xcite . however , the recent detailed statistical analyses of biological networks manifest some discrepancies between the networks generated by the ba model and biological networks . in particular , there are two striking properties as follows",
    ".    one of the properties is a small - world feature @xcite .",
    "this feature is reflected in high clustering coefficients @xmath5 , which denote the density of edges between neighbors of a given node , and implies modularity of networks @xcite .",
    "the modular structures are actively investigated with statistical approaches , and it is found that clustering spectra , defined as correlations between degree @xmath0 of a given node and the clustering coefficient @xmath5 of the node , follow the power law with exponent @xmath6 ; thus @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the power - law spectrum , observed in biological networks , suggests a hierarchical structure of modules @xcite . however ,",
    "ba networks do not exhibit a power - law clustering spectrum , indicating the absence of the hierarchical structures @xcite . in order to fill the gap , we propose a model ( hereinafter called mm model ) with growth mechanism by merging modules and pa from the ba model .",
    "the mm model shows power - law clustering spectra and power - law degree distributions with arbitrary degree exponents , demonstrating that our model can reproduce finer details of biological networks @xcite .",
    "the other of the properties is a heterogeneous degree - degree correlation @xcite , defined as correlation between degree @xmath0 of a given node and average degree @xmath8 of neighbors of the node . in biological networks , the degree - degree correlations follow power law ; @xmath9 with a negative exponent , @xmath10 , empirically found @xcite .",
