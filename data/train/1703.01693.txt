    "a microwave generator creates a tone that is routed into a @xmath25he cryostat and attenuated .",
    "the tone impinges on the sum port of a 180 degree hybrid coupler ( krytar 4040124 ) , which divides the power into two coherent components .",
    "the signals then travel through the two tibs , and are summed together with a 90 degree hybrid ( fairview microwave sh7219 ) .",
    "finally , the tone propagates through the microwave receiver and is readout in a spectrum analyzer or vector network analyzer .        to control the transmission of the tibs , three control currents are used .",
    "first , an off - chip magnetic coil ( orange circle ) creates a uniform magnetic flux @xmath26 across the entire chip ( @xmath27 moe ) .",
    "the second and third control currents run in a pair of on - chip bias lines ( blue inductors ) that create gradiometric fluxes for the two tibs . to operate a tib as a double - balanced modulator",
    ", we fix the current in the off - chip magnetic coil and dynamically modulate the current @xmath28 in its on - chip bias line .",
    "this changes the imbalance of the tib , and thus its transmission @xmath29 .",
    "judicious choice of this control current @xmath28 can substantially improve modulator performance . to calibrate this",
    ", we first use a network analyzer to measure the transmission through each tib as a function of an applied dc current in its on - chip bias line .",
    "the other tib is unbiased during this measurement ( its inductor bridge is balanced and incident signals will be reflected ) allowing for independent calibration of both tibs .",
    "[ fig : supp2]a shows the squared amplitude ( top row ) and phase ( bottom row ) of signals transmitted through each tib , as a function of the probe frequency and a gradiometric flux @xmath30 that is proportional to the control current . in the squared amplitude plots",
    ", one observes low transmission when @xmath31 is small , and maximal transmitted power when @xmath32 .",
    "here @xmath33 is the reduced flux quantum , with @xmath34 planck s constant over 2@xmath21 and @xmath35 the charge of an electron .",
    "the uniform flux is fixed at @xmath36 . because half the signal is dissipated in the 50 ohm termination on the 90 degree hybrid , and another half is reflected by the un - probed arm of the network ,",
    "the maximum possible transmission in this configuration is -6 db . from the plots of phase in the bottom row",
    ", one can see that inverting the polarity of the bias current causes a @xmath21 phase shift in the transmission .",
    ", with probe frequency fixed at 6 ghz . when bias current is swept sinusoidally , transmission changes in a non - sinusoidal manner .",
    "( c ) applying a bias current @xmath37 produces approximately sinusoidal modulation of transmission , as seen in ( d ) . for tib # 1 ,",
    "the map @xmath38 is not invertible , which causes some distortion ( higher harmonics of @xmath5 ) in the transmitted spectrum .",
    "( e ) power spectral density of transmission when current is modulated sinusoidally ( filled circles ) , and when the current is chosen to produce sinusoidal transmission ( unfilled diamonds ) .",
    "spectra are normalized to the total power in each sideband .",
    "pulse shaping reduces the weight of unwanted higher harmonics by approximately 20 db .",
    "data for tib#1 ( tib#2 ) are shown in blue ( orange ) . ]",
    "linecuts of the real part of the transmission at 6 ghz are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : supp2]b .",
    "these are maps @xmath38 between the applied control current and the transmission through the bridges .",
    "if these maps were linear , a sinusoidal control current would induce a sinusoidal modulation of the transmission through the tib .",
    "transmission , however , is a nonlinear function of the control current.@xcite to ensure sinusoidal modulation by the tibs at the desired angular frequency @xmath5 , we use an arbitrary waveform generator to apply the control current @xmath39 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : supp2]c ) .",
    "here @xmath40 denotes the inverse of the map @xmath38 .",
    "the time - dependence of the transmission , @xmath41 , is then ensured by function composition to be the desired value of @xmath42 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : supp2]d ) .",
    "when @xmath38 is not a one - to - one mapping ( fig .",
    "[ fig : supp2]b , blue curve ) this procedure only produces an approximation of sinusoidal modulation  @xcite ( fig .",

    "the overall effect of this procedure can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : supp2]e , which plots the power spectral density of @xmath41 for both tibs , when the bias currents are sinusoidal ( circles ) and when the bias currents are chosen to produce sinusoidal transmission ( diamonds ) .",
    "the latter method reduces the spectral weight of higher harmonics by about 20 db .",
    "harmonics in the spectrum of @xmath41 are imprinted directly onto the spectrum of signals transmitted through the ssbm . fig .",
    "[ fig : supp3 ] shows the nearest 10 harmonics around the carrier as the iq phase difference is swept .",
    "the lo port of the device is driven by a microwave tone at @xmath11 ghz and the i and q ports are driven by angular frequencies of @xmath14 mhz ( fig .",

    "]    as @xmath5 is increased and signals are converted farther from the carrier , both the carrier and the spurious harmonics increase in magnitude . this is a consequence of the finite bandwidth of our arbitrary waveform generator ( tektronix awg5014c ) , which samples at 1.2 gs / s and has a bandwidth of 180 mhz .",
    "( for input powers much less than the 1 db compression point , the size of spurious harmonics does not depend on the power of the input signal . ) as the if modulation rate @xmath5 grows , the number of points available to represent the control current pulse @xmath46 decreases , and the bandwidth needed to capture fine corrections to @xmath46 increases .",
    "this diminishes the ability of the pulse - shaping routine to ensure approximately sinusoidal transmission .",
    "for instance , as @xmath47 changes from 3 to 60 mhz , the image rejection goes from 30 db to 20 db , and the sideband contrast goes from 25 db to 13 db .",
    "the previous sections shows frequency conversion of pure microwave tones with an ssbm . in the envisaged application ,",
    "however , the ssbm must convert wavepackets with more complex spectral composition .",
    "a realistic example of such a signal is a microwave tone that is phase modulated in time , at a rate set by the bandwidth of the qubit readout cavity .",
    "such a signal simulates the dataflow from a qubit - cavity system that is being continuously monitored , say , for the detection of quantum jumps : as the qubit state stochastically jumps between ground and excited , the phase of the transmitted microwave tone concomitantly acquires a phase shift of 0 or @xmath21 radians .",
    "the phase modulation of the transmitted signal creates a wavepacket with a richer frequency content than the orginal tone , and extraction of the information in the phase modulation requires single - sideband modulation of the entire wavepacket .    to simulate this process",
    ", we use the ssbm to frequency - convert a microwave tone that is amplitude modulated with a square wave at frequency @xmath48 .",
    "( for this demonstration , we use amplitude modulation in place of phase modulation to allow detection with a spectrum analyzer . )",
    "we measure the modulation of the signal s amplitude in time ( fig .  [",
    "fig : supp4]a - c ) , and the spectrum of the converted signal ( fig .",
    "[ fig : supp4]d - f ) .",
    "amplitude modulations of @xmath49 100 khz , 1 mhz , and 5 mhz are shown in the top , middle , and bottom rows of the figure .",
    "for each modulation , the four traces show frequency conversion by 0 , 3 , 20 , or 60 mhz , as evidenced by the shifted spectra in the figure s right column .",

    "are shown for modulation rates of 100 khz ( top row ) , 1 mhz ( middle row ) , and 5 mhz ( bottom row ) . at each of the three modulation rates",
    ", we use the ssbm to convert the frequency of an input tone by 0 , 3 , 20 , and 60 mhz .",
    "these are depicted by the four traces in each panel . for visual clarity , the amplitude of the unconverted signals ( blue traces ) in ( a - c )",
    "are scaled by a factor of 1/2 . ]    from fig .",
    "[ fig : supp4 ] , one can see that the instantaneous bandwidth of the ssbm exceeds 5 mhz . at higher frequencies , for example 5 mhz ,",
    "distortion of the square - wave begins to become apparent .",
    "we believe the instantaneous bandwidth of the device is currently limited by the relaxation of eddy currents in the chip ground plane .",
    "this relaxation time can be substantially reduced in future devices .",
    "to assess the power - handling of the ssbm we sweep the on - chip power during operation at @xmath50 mhz , @xmath45 ghz , and @xmath51 degrees ( up - conversion ) , and measure the power transmitted at various harmonics of the modulation rate .",
    "[ fig : linearity ] shows the results .",

    "only the four nearest odd harmonics and the carrier are plotted , though the other harmonics exhibit similar behavior .",
    "ghz , @xmath53 = 3 mhz , and @xmath51 degrees .",
    "1 db compression occurs at -85 dbm . ]",
    "when the incident power is below -95 dbm , the output power in the carrier and all the sidebands scales linearly . as the input power increases",
    ", 1 db compression in the first blue sideband occurs at -85 dbm .",
    "this value is consistent with previous results , which found the 1 db compression point of a single tib to be -88 dbm  @xcite .",
    "( as the tibs in our ssbm need only process one - half the power incident on the device s input , the ssbm s compression point is 3 db below that of a single tib . ) in a dispersive readout scheme the power of a readout tone depends on the dressed cavity bandwidth , but most tones fall between -130 and -120 dbm  @xcite .",
    "the ssbm s 1 db compression point at -85 dbm thus provides ample power handling for this application .",
    "as the ssbm is created with two instances of a tib , design improvements for the single - sideband modulator may be partitioned into two categories : changes of the tib , and changes of the composite device ( the two tibs , hybrid couplers , and internal microwave connections ) .",
    "we address these in turn .",
    "as mentioned in the main text , immediate improvements on the tib may be realized by eliminating the chip - mode around 5 ghz ( apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig : supp2]a ) , and by improving the impedance match .",
    "the chip - mode is an lc resonance between the inductance of the balun coils and a parasitic capacitance to ground , which can be tuned out of the operation band by manipulating the width of the balun microstrips ( their length is constrained to be a quarter wavelength at the operation frequency ) .    in the current generation of devices ,",
    "impedance matching a tib to 50 ohms is inhibited by the finite tunability of the inductors in the bridge and the impedance of those inductors ( about 20 ohms at 6 ghz ) with respect to 50 ohms .",
    "we overcome this problem by tuning out the residual inductance with capacitors in series with the four nodes of the bridge .",
    "although this is an expedient solution , the resulting match is effective only within several hundred mhz of the frequency for which the capacitors have the appropriate impedance . a more sophisticated approach , such as tapered lines or matching transformers , could easily expand this bandwidth to several ghz , as the bode - fano criterion  @xcite is relatively lenient for low @xmath54 circuits .",
    "more quantitatively , an imbalanced tib may be modeled as an inductor in series with a 50 ohm load .",
    "the thevenin equivalent inductance of a tib with inductors parametrized as @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( as in fig .",
    "2b of the main text ) is @xmath55 , which for the tibs in this device amounts to 800 ph when the bridges are maximally imbalanced .",
    "the bode - fano criterion thus allows for -20 db reflections over an 8 ghz bandwidth .",
    "improved impedance matching may therefore drastically reduce return loss over the 4 to 8 ghz band .",
    "better impedance matching can also be achieved directly by improving the tunability ( dynamic range ) of the squid critical currents .",
    "while reducing the number of squids in each array will accomplish this by reducing geometric inductance and enhancing participation ratios , power handling will suffer . another way to improve tunability",
    "is to more uniformly distribute the gradiometric flux across the length of the array , which reduces variation in the critical currents of the squids that make up the array . in the current layout , squids near the inside corners of the bias line couple more strongly to it , and are threaded by greater amounts of flux .",
    "laying out the figure - eight of the bridge so that the bias line can bisect it without making turns will alleviate this problem , increase the degree to which the bridge can be imbalanced , and reduce impedance mismatch .",
    "finally , the instantaneous bandwidth of the tib may also be improved by elimination of long timescale eddy currents in the chip ground plane .",
    "this can be done by altering the resistance ( modifying the @xmath56 time ) of a normal metal layer placed in the chip ground plane to break supercurrent loops .",
    "in addition to improving the constituent components , a next - generation ssbm can also benefit from complete on - chip integration .",
    "first , on - chip superconducting hybrids can be extremely low - loss .",
    "second , path length differences in the two arms of the network can be easily constrained to micron length scales , making them smaller than the operation wavelengths by more than four orders of magnitude .",
    "( to contrast , in our current device this path length difference is 3 mm ) .",
    "suppressing path length difference far below the operation wavelength allows for simultaneous minimization of the power in the image sideband and maximization of the power in the desired sideband .",
    "a third considerable benefit of moving to a completely monolithic circuit is the recovery of an additional 3 db of modulation gain . in the current implementation ,",
    "an off - chip power splitter divides the input power and delivers it to the two on - chip tibs . during operation",
    ", this distributed network suffers from return loss , as each tib is mismatched from 50 ohms during portions of the modulation period ( a portion of this reflected power is dissipated in the power divider at the input , and another portion exits the device s input as return loss ) .",
    "it also results in an additional 3 db of insertion loss ; when signals in the two arms of the interferometer are summed in the 90 degree hybrid , the image ( undesired ) sideband is dissipated in the terminated port of the hybrid .    to remedy this ,",
    "we propose using a 90-degree hybrid coupler as the power - divider at the device s input , and combining the signals in the interferometer with a one - to - one transformer . although this layout does not recover the 3 db of return and insertion loss at the device s input , it eliminates the 3 db of insertion loss from the image sideband at the output .",
    "an ssbm designed in this way could operate with a modulation gain of -3 db ."

    "<S> the different traces depict different l frequencies @xmath22 ( color ) , for selection of the blue ( solid lines ) and red ( dashed lines ) sidebands . ]    in addition to sideband contrast , other important specifications for a ssbm are the modulation gain , l , r , and i frequency limits , instantaneous bandwidth , linearity , and return and insertion losses . </S>",
    "<S> modulation gain is plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3]b as a function of @xmath5 , for tones at several different input frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> two major trends are visible : first , modulation gain decreases as @xmath5 increases . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is a consequence of the bandwidth requirement of the pulse - shaping scheme used to sinusoidally modulate transmission through the tibs , which begins to exceed our control hardware s bandwidth as @xmath5 increases.@xcite the second trend is a variation in the modulation gain achieved at small modulation frequencies as the probe frequency @xmath19 changes . </S>",
    "<S> this is caused by a change in the phase of a tib s transmission as its magnitude is modulated . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is evident in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s2 of the supplementary material , and may be partially alleviated in a future device by removal of a chip - mode at 5 ghz .    </S>",
    "<S> figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3]a and  b also show the ranges of l , r , and i frequencies that can be processed by the ssbm . </S>",
    "<S> the device converts frequencies from / into the 4 to 8 ghz band , shifting them by as much as 120 mhz to the red or blue . for an fdm application in superconducting qubit readout , the quantity with which to compare </S>",
    "<S> this is the coupling strength of a readout cavity s strongly coupled port @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> allowing 3 @xmath23 of spectrum per readout channel , and taking a representative value of several mhz for @xmath24@xcite , such an i range allows for 10 to 40 ( or more@xcite ) independent readout channels per input line .    </S>",
    "<S> conversion of amplitude - modulated tones with the ssbm , and measurements of its linearity , are shown in supplementary figs .  </S>",
    "<S> s4 and  s5 . </S>",
    "<S> the instantaneous bandwidth of the device exceeds 5 mhz , and its 1 db compression point is -85 dbm , providing sufficient bandwidth and power - handling for dispersive qubit readout .    </S>",
    "<S> we now discuss return and insertion loss of our ssbm . although the insertion loss of the tibs is less than 0.5 db@xcite , our ssbm dissipates 3 db of the input power ( the entire image sideband ) in the fourth port of the 90 degree hybrid at the device s output . </S>",
    "<S> as noted previously , an additional 3 db ( or more ) of power is dissipated / returned by our distributed network when the tibs are operated as modulators  this is precisely the modulation gain plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3]b . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the tibs themselves are not perfectly transmitting over the entire range of operating frequencies . to quantify this , </S>",
    "<S> unnormalized transmission in the 4 - 8 ghz band is plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s2 of the supplementary material , with independent measurements on both tibs . </S>",
    "<S> although this transmission approaches unity at some frequencies , it is degraded elsewhere by the presence of a chip mode around 5 ghz and impedance mismatches outside the 5 - 7 ghz band .    </S>",
    "<S> a future integrated design for the ssbm could improve on many of these specifications : removal of the chip mode and matching the circuit impedance over the entire 4 - 8 ghz band are well - posed problems in microwave engineering . </S>",
    "<S> an on - chip implementation will improve sideband contrast by suppressing path length differences in the network below an operation wavelength and shrink device footprint by two orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> an additional 3 db of conversion gain can also be recovered by using the quadrature hybrid as the power divider on the input and employing a one - to - one transformer to combine the outputs of the two tibs  this eliminates the power dissipated in the image sideband . </S>",
    "<S> a next - generation device could thus operate over a several ghz frequency range with negligible return and insertion loss and modulation gain approaching -3 db . </S>",
    "<S> further design considerations for a future device are provided in the supplementary material .    </S>",
    "<S> a single sideband modulator constructed from the repeated instancing of broadband modulation elements like tibs is thus an appealing , general purpose way to engineer frequency conversion . </S>",
    "<S> the l and r bandwidths allow for conversion of tones in the 4 - 8 ghz band , and the device s 1 db compression point at -85 dbm far exceeds the power typically@xcite used for dispersive readout . in addition , low return , insertion , and modulation losses are achievable in future design iterations . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the ssbm s nonlinear elements require no ghz frequency control lines , and are actuated solely with radio frequency signals ( several hundred mhz or less ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore suitable for construction of the scalable and flexible multiplexed architectures needed in future many - qubit experiments with superconducting circuits .    </S>",
