    "understanding the mechanism for removing angular momentum from a fluid element , thereby allowing accretion to occur , is essential to understanding these systems . orbiting ,",
    "magnetized gas is unstable to the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) @xcite ; all that is required is a subthermal magnetic field sufficiently coupled to differentially rotating gas with a negative outward angular velocity gradient .",
    "the mri leads to turbulent flow , resulting in maxwell and reynolds stresses that efficiently transport angular momentum and drive accretion .",
    "however , it is still uncertain what determines the amplitude of the magnetic energy and stress in saturated mri - driven turbulence .",
    "because linear analysis can offer only limited guidance , numerical simulations have been used to investigate the properties of mri - driven turbulence .",
    "most simulations of the mri employ the shearing box approximation , in which the simulation domain consists of a local corotating patch of accretion disk , small enough to expand the mhd equations into cartesian coordinates and ignore curvature terms ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this approximation , in its simplest form , reduces the problem to its basic ingredients : differential rotation and magnetized fluid .",
    "it is hoped that a more complete understanding of this simple model will provide insights into the mechanisms that determine the stress levels in astrophysical systems .",
    "the first shearing box simulations @xcite found that the presence of a net magnetic field and its orientation play a role in setting the amplitude of the mri turbulence . a net magnetic field results from currents located outside of the computational domain and can not change as a result of the evolution .",
    "for zero net field simulations , on the other hand , complete decay of the field is possible .",
    "net vertical fields gave the largest turbulent energies , with the energy level approximately proportional to the background field .",
    "net toroidal fields behave similarly , but with a smaller energy for the same background field strength .",
    "zero net field simulations saturated at levels comparable to those seen in net toroidal field cases .",
    "in subsequent years , there have been many shearing box simulations which confirm these qualitative behaviors , but the factors that determine the amplitude of the turbulent energy still remain uncertain . some studies have examined numerical effects such as computational domain size and resolution , and others have looked at physical parameters such as background field strength and gas pressure .",
    "an investigation of the influence of gas pressure carried out by @xcite , for example , found an extremely weak pressure dependence .",
    "even here , the influence of the gas pressure depends on the magnetic field geometry .",
    "@xcite examined the results of an ensemble of shearing box simulations taken from the literature and found that @xmath8 is generally constant , where @xmath9 is the total stress divided by the gas pressure , and @xmath10 is the ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure . in other words , stress is proportional to magnetic energy .    a physical influence that has , until recently , received less attention is physical dissipation , namely shear viscosity @xmath1 and ohmic resistivity @xmath2 .",
    "the linear dispersion relation for the vertical field mri in the presence of @xmath1 and @xmath2 was derived by @xcite .",
    "both terms can reduce the effectiveness of the mri . in the linear regime , viscosity damps the mri growth rates and changes the wavelength of the fastest growing mode , but does not alter the wavenumbers that are unstable .",
    "resistivity introduces a cutoff on the unstable wavelengths where the resistive diffusion time becomes comparable to the mri growth time ( see , e.g. , the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "nonaxisymmetric mri modes with ohmic resistivity were examined by @xcite .",
    "they found that resistivity reduces the amplification of such modes , and if large enough , can stabilize the toroidal field mri .",
    "simulations by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have investigated the influence of a nonzero ohmic resistivity on the saturated state .",
    "the main result of these studies is that increasing the resistivity leads to a decrease in turbulence , independent of the magnetic field configuration . in zero net field models ,",
    "the effect of resistivity on the turbulence is larger than one might expect from the linear mri relation @xcite , with the turbulence decaying to zero for relatively low values of resistivity .",
    "recently , the work of @xcite ( hereafter f07 ) and @xcite has sparked new interest in the effects of non - ideal mhd on the mri .",
    "f07 showed that both resistivity and viscosity are important in determining the stress level in mri turbulent flows with zero net magnetic field .",
    "@xcite came to the same conclusion for models with a net vertical field .",
    "the results were characterized in terms of the magnetic prandtl number , defined as @xmath3 . in these simulations , the saturation level increases with increasing @xmath6 .",
    "f07 also find that for the zero net field case , there exists a @xmath6 below which the turbulence dies out , and that this critical @xmath6 decreases with decreasing viscosity ( at least for the range in viscosity and resistivity examined in the paper ) .",
    "one magnetic field geometry that has not yet been explored with both physical resistivity and viscosity is that of a net toroidal field .",
    "such fields could be the most relevant to astrophysical disks .",
    "following the arguments of @xcite and references therein , both global and local disk simulations as well as observations of disk galaxies show a dominance of toroidal field over other field components .",
    "indeed , the background shear flow naturally creates toroidal field from radial field .",
    "it seems likely that any given region of an accretion disk will contain some net azimuthal field .    in this paper",
    ", we perform the first investigation of the toroidal field mri in the presence of _ both _ viscosity and resistivity and compare the outcomes with those obtained for zero net and net vertical field simulations .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in ",
    "[ method ] , we describe our algorithm , parameters , and tests of our viscosity and resistivity implementation . for comparison purposes , we reexamine the simulations of f07 with our code in   [ zero_net_flux ] . our main results , focusing on the toroidal field simulations , are presented in ",

    "in this study , we use the @xmath0 code , a second - order accurate godunov scheme for solving the equations of mhd in conservative form using the dimensionally unsplit corner transport upwind ( ctu ) method of @xcite coupled with the third - order in space piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ) of @xcite and a constrained transport ( ct ; * ? ? ? * ) algorithm for preserving the @xmath11  =  0 constraint .",
    "a description of this algorithm and various test problems is given in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "for the present study , we have added physical dissipation in the form of a constant kinematic shear viscosity and ohmic resistivity using operator splitting , as described in more detail below .",
    "bulk viscosity is ignored .",
    "the shearing box approximation is a model for a local region of a disk orbiting at a radius @xmath12 whose size is small compared to this radius , allowing us to expand the equations of motion in cartesian form , as described in detail by @xcite .",
    "the box corotates with an angular velocity @xmath13 corresponding to the value at the center of the box .",
    "the shearing box evolution equations with viscosity and resistivity are given by @xcite and are : @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the mass density , @xmath18 is the momentum density , @xmath19 is the magnetic field , @xmath20 is the gas pressure , and @xmath21 is the shear parameter , defined as @xmath22ln@xmath23ln@xmath12 .",
    "we use @xmath24 , appropriate for a keplerian disk .",
    "we assume an isothermal equation of state @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the isothermal sound speed .",
    "shear viscosity and ohmic resistivity are denoted by @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively .",
    "note that our system of units has the magnetic permeability @xmath27 .",
    "the first source term on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ momentum ] ) corresponds to tidal forces ( gravity and centrifugal ) in the corotating frame .",
    "the second source term in equation  ( [ momentum ] ) is the coriolis force .",
    "finally , we have omitted the vertical component of gravity , making these `` unstratified '' shearing box simulations .",
    "adapting the @xmath0 code to the shearing box problem requires adding the tidal and coriolis force terms and implementing the shearing - periodic boundary conditions at the @xmath28 boundaries .",
    "the source terms are included in the algorithm in a directionally unsplit manner , consistent with the ctu algorithm .",
    "we do not use the crank - nicholson method of @xcite that ensures precise conservation of epicyclic energy .",
    "we have found this added complexity to be unnecessary for simulations dominated by the mri ( see arguments in * ? ? ?",
    "the shearing - periodic boundary conditions are described in @xcite .",
    "quantities are linearly reconstructed in the ghost zones from appropriate zones in the physical domain that have been shifted along @xmath29 to account for the shear across the boundaries .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath29 momentum is adjusted to account for the shear across the @xmath28 boundaries as fluid moves out one boundary and enters at the other .",
    "note that to preserve a quantity to machine precision across a grid boundary such as the shearing - periodic boundary ( or a boundary between different grids in a mesh - refinement scheme ) , it is necessary to reconstruct a quantity s flux ( or for the magnetic field , the electromotive force , emf ) at the boundary , rather than the quantity itself ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to conserve total vertical field flux , for example",
    ", we reconstruct the @xmath29 emf at the @xmath28 boundaries .",
    "this is essential , given the strong effect that a net vertical field has on the turbulence level .",
    "the perfect conservation of net toroidal flux is not as important , and as ensuring its precise conservation involves a more complex procedure , we allow the @xmath30 flux to be conserved only to truncation level . note that in our simulations initialized with a net toroidal field , this truncation error results in a loss of net @xmath30 flux from the domain ; @xmath31 5 - 10 % of the initial toroidal field is lost per 100 orbits for our high resolution , sustained turbulence simulations .",
    "this corresponds to a background @xmath10 value of @xmath31 110 - 120 at 100 orbits . while this truncation error does not appear to have any significant affect on the turbulent energy levels in our simulations",
    ", it may become important to conserve @xmath30 to roundoff level for longer evolution times .",
    "the radial flux , @xmath32 , will automatically be conserved to machine precision because its evolution is determined by emfs on the periodic @xmath29 and @xmath33 boundaries .",
    "we also reconstruct the density flux on the @xmath28 boundaries to conserve the total mass in the domain to machine precision .",
    "the systematic difference between the calculation of outward and inward fluxes at the shearing @xmath28 boundaries can lead to a loss of mass from the grid @xcite .",
    "we do not reconstruct momentum fluxes at the boundaries as the source terms will prevent roundoff level conservation of momentum .    both the viscosity and resistivity are added via operator splitting ; the fluid variables updated from the ctu integrator are used to calculate the viscous and resistive terms on the right - hand side of equations  ( [ momentum ] ) and ( [ induction ] ) .",
    "these terms are discretized in a flux - conservative manner consistent with the @xmath0 algorithm .",
    "in particular , the third and fourth terms on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ momentum ] ) are written so that @xmath34 and @xmath35 are defined as fluxes at the cell faces .",
    "taking the divergence of the third term and the gradient of the fourth term via finite - differencing ensures that momentum conservation is not violated by the viscous terms . the resistive contribution to the induction equation",
    "is added in a manner consistent with the emfs ; the term @xmath36 is computed at cell corners to ensure that when differenced via the curl operator , @xmath37 is maintained .",
    "note that this resistive contribution to the emf must also be reconstructed at the shearing - periodic boundaries in order to preserve @xmath38 precisely .",
    "more generally , the viscous term in equation  ( [ momentum ] ) can be written in a flux - conservative manner as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a viscous stress tensor defined as @xmath41 where the indices refer to the spatial components @xcite . for simplicity , we have used the form as in equation  ( [ momentum ] ) which is equivalent to equation  ( [ stress_tensor ] ) assuming that @xmath42 is spatially constant .",
    "we have performed a few shearing box experiments with both implementations , and find no significant differences in turbulent stress evolution . in particular , we restarted a few simulations using the form in equation  ( [ stress_tensor ] ) .",
    "we found that the volume - averaged magnetic energies are initially indistinguishable between the two approaches . due to the chaotic nature of the mri ,",
    "the two curves eventually diverge , but nevertheless maintain the same time average .",
    "the addition of viscosity and resistivity places an additional constraint on the time step , @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the cfl number ( @xmath44 = 0.4 here ) , @xmath45 is the time step limit from the main integration algorithm ( see * ? ? ? * ) , and @xmath46 is the minimum grid spacing , @xmath47 .",
    "several three - dimensional tests of viscosity and resistivity revealed that if the viscous or resistive time step is close to @xmath48 , the evolution becomes numerically unstable .",
    "this problem was remedied by multiplying the viscous and resistive time steps by 0.75 . the additional 4/3 factor in the denominator of the viscous time step results from the last term on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ momentum ] ) .",
    "this can be most easily understood by considering a one - dimensional problem , in which case the effective @xmath1 value increases by a factor of 4/3 due to the compressibility term .",
    "therefore , the effective @xmath1 that goes into the time step calculation is taken as @xmath49 .",
    "note that most of our simulations will have @xmath1 and @xmath2 sufficiently small that the viscous and resistive time steps are large compared to @xmath50 .",
    "in fact , only the simulations with the largest values of @xmath2 and @xmath1 reach the diffusion limit on @xmath51 .",
    "we performed a number of problems to test the implementation of viscosity and resistivity within @xmath0 .",
    "resistivity was tested by solving the diffusion of a current sheet along one dimension ; a uniform magnetic field is initialized with a change in sign across one grid zone .",
    "this problem has a simple analytic solution ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the agreement between the numerical and analytic solution was excellent . by replacing the magnetic field with a uniform velocity flow , the identical",
    "test can be performed for the viscosity .",
    "again , the numerical solution agreed with the analytic solution .",
    "next , we initialized a uniform vertical magnetic field in a shearing box with nonzero viscosity and resistivity and measured the growth of various mri modes in the linear regime .",
    "we compared the measured values with those from analytic linear theory ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and found excellent agreement for a wide range in viscosity and resistivity .    finally , we examined the propagation of small amplitude , isothermal sound and @xmath52 waves in the presence of viscosity and resistivity .",
    "again , the numerical solution can be compared directly to an analytic solution .",
    "these tests were done in one , two , and three dimensions ; in the multidimensional tests , the propagation direction of the wave was chosen to be along the grid diagonal .",
    "the resistivity was tested via the decay of the @xmath52 waves , and the viscosity was tested via the decay of the sound waves . the error as a function of @xmath28 resolution for two of these tests",
    "is given in fig .",
    "[ lw_conv ] .",
    "the error is calculated from the square root of the sum of the squared errors in the density and momenta ( for the sound wave ) and the density , momenta , and magnetic field ( for the @xmath52 wave ) .",
    "the solution to each wave converges at a rate very close to second order , shown by the dashed line .",
    "the shearing box used in this study has radial size @xmath53 , azimuthal size @xmath54 , and vertical size @xmath55 .",
    "most of the simulations presented here use @xmath56 equally spaced grid zones ; some simulations use half the number of zones in each direction .",
    "the initial velocity is @xmath57 , with @xmath21  =  3/2 , @xmath13  =  0.001 , and @xmath58 .",
    "the isothermal sound speed is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the scale height . with @xmath61 , we have @xmath26  =  @xmath62 , and with @xmath63 , the initial pressure is @xmath64 .",
    "the dissipation terms @xmath1 and @xmath2 are parameterized in terms of the reynolds number ,    @xmath65    the magnetic reynolds number ,    @xmath66    and the magnetic prandtl number ,    @xmath67    since the properties of the mri are more directly determined by the @xmath52 speed rather than the sound speed , another useful dimensionless quantity is the elsasser number ,    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the @xmath52 speed . with @xmath59 and @xmath70 ,",
    "we can relate @xmath71 to @xmath72 ,    @xmath73    in addition to the explicit dissipation terms , there will also be some effective diffusion due to numerical effects .",
    "generally speaking , numerical diffusion will not behave in the same manner as physical diffusion ( e.g. , it is not a simple function of a gradient in field or velocity ) ; numerical diffusion generally has a much stronger effect at small scales than at large scales .",
    "also the effects of numerical diffusion may be different from one type of simulation to another . by calculating numerical losses at high wavenmbers in fourier space and modeling those as if they were physical viscosity and resistivity , @xcite quantified the numerical dissipation of @xmath0 .",
    "they found that the effective @xmath71 for the zero net field and net z field simulations at @xmath74 were 20000 and 8000 respectively , and 7000 and 5000 for @xmath75 .",
    "the effective @xmath6 is @xmath31 2 for these simulations .",
    "since numerical dissipation is problem - dependent , these numbers should be regarded as estimates , and their values will likely be somewhat different in different applications .",
    "however , they serve as a guideline for including physical dissipation . in the present study ,",
    "numerical and physical dissipation may be comparable at large wavenumbers for @xmath76 .",
    "the physical dissipation in some of our simulations may fall into this marginally resolved regime .",
    "nevertheless , we can explore a large enough range in @xmath77 and @xmath71 values to observe clear effects due to viscosity and resistivity .",
    "@xcite and @xcite presented the surprising result that for zero net field shearing box simulations without any explicit dissipation terms , the steady - state turbulent energy decreases with increasing grid resolution .",
    "@xcite obtained the same result for zero net field simulations without explicit dissipation using the @xmath0 code .",
    "these results pointed to the importance of including explicit dissipation terms in such simulations .",
    "f07 showed that turbulent activity is strongly influenced by these dissipation terms ; the saturated stress increases with increasing @xmath6 . here",

    "the time average is calculated from orbit 20 until the end of the simulation , and as is the case throughout this paper , volume average refers to an average over the entire simulation domain .",
    "the results of these simulations are consistent with those of f07 . for example , f07 lists @xmath9 values for a @xmath86 and @xmath87 model run with four different codes , including zeus .",
    "these values range from @xmath88 to @xmath89 ; we obtain @xmath90 . the increase in turbulent energy levels with @xmath6",

    "this idea will need to be tested with higher resolution simulations to ensure that the ( small ) viscous and resistive scales are adequately resolved .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath6 still has an influence on the turbulence even for very small values of viscosity and resistivity , our results ( taken together with those in the literature ) could be applicable to such disks .",
    "the resistivity , viscosity , and @xmath6 can vary quite substantially in these systems , not only between different astrophysical objects , but also within a given disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite analyze a possible @xmath6 dependence on radius in x - ray binaries to suggest that such a dependence could be at the core of spectral state transitions in these systems .",
    "the work to date is suggestive , but there remain several limitations associated with these shearing box simulations .",
    "first , the simulations are unstratified ; vertical gravity may also play a role in establishing the overall turbulent state .",
    "for example , @xcite carried out a series of zero net field shearing box simulations with vertical gravity and explicit dissipation and found that the turbulence does not decay as readily as in the unstratified case .",
    "secondly , all of the simulations to date have explored a relatively restricted range of parameters . here , for example",
    ", we have examined only one value for the toroidal field strength and one domain size . finally , as touched upon above ,",
    "the range of values for @xmath77 and @xmath71 that have been studied are somewhat restricted and certainly much smaller than would be appropriate for many astrophysical disk systems . while this limitation is partially computational and",
    "can be improved upon with higher resolutions , the question remains for astrophysical systems whether viscous and resistive processes that take place on relatively small lengthscales can have a significant influence on macroscopic stress terms whose scales are on order the pressure scale height in the disk .",
    "but regardless of the importance of resistivity and viscosity for astrophysical systems , the values of @xmath77 and @xmath71 are very important for setting @xmath9 in numerical simulations , much more so than many other shearing box parameters ( e.g. , pressure ) studied to date . without a more thorough understanding of the role that dissipation terms play , quantitative predictions of @xmath9 values from simulations will not be possible .    in summary ,",
    "our experiments have explored the effect of changing viscosity and resistivity on mri simulations with a net toroidal field .",
    "this work serves to expand upon previous investigations of the impact of small - scale dissipation . while the direct applicability of studies such as this to specific stress values within astrophysical systems remains uncertain , it is likely that for the conceivable future , numerical simulations will be our primary , if not only way to explore the nature of mri - driven turbulence .",
    "a thorough understanding of mri turbulence can only be obtained with a complete understanding of the effects of diffusion , both numerical and physical .",
