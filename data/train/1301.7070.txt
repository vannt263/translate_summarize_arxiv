    "the disintegrating sagittarius ( sgr ) dwarf galaxy remains a riddle , wrapped in a mystery , inside an enigma .",
    "large scale photometric surveys , such as the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) have now revealed the structure of the tidal tails of the sgr over more than @xmath2 radians on the sky  @xcite . by tallying all the stellar debris in the streams and remnant , we now know that the progenitor galaxy had a luminosity of @xmath3 , comparable to the present day small magellanic cloud  @xcite .",
    "the ingestation of such a large progenitor , together with its dismantling under the actions of the galactic tides , can provide us with a wealth of information about both the galaxy and the sgr , if we can only decode it .",
    "radial velocities , and sometimes metallicities and chemical abundances , are now known for many hundreds of stars in the sgr tails  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are also @xmath0 10 globular clusters associated with the sgr tails  @xcite .",
    "this rich mosaic of positions and velocities of sgr tracers has proved surprisingly difficult to understand .",
    "although there is no shortage of sgr disruption models in the literature  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , they all have significant shortcomings , and fail to reproduce a substantial portion of the datasets .",
    "the most successful recent attempt is by @xcite , though they do not explain the striking two stream morphology seen in the sdss data  @xcite .",
    "additionally they advocate the use of a triaxial halo for the galaxy with minor axis contained with the galactic plane , which is unattractive on other grounds  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "given the impasse , it is natural to look to proper motions of the sgr stream as so as to obtain a clearer picture of its space motion .",
    "@xcite have provided the first measurements of the proper motion of the sgr trailing tail .",
    "they took advantage of archival photographic plate data in some of kapteyn s selected areas which provides a 90 year baseline .",
    "they derive proper motions for four @xmath4 fields covering locations on the trailing tail between @xmath5 and @xmath6 from the sgr core .",
    "however , the number of stars in each field remains modest ( @xmath7 ) , and so the precision of the proper motion measurement is still quite low ( @xmath8 mas yr@xmath1 ) .    here",
    ", we will pursue a different tack to obtain proper motions of the trailing stream in roughly the same area of sky . as part of a project to detect supernovae , the sloan digital sky survey scanned a @xmath9 square degree region on the celestial equator , known as stripe 82  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "proper motions can be derived by matching objects between the @xmath10 epochs  @xcite obtained over time period of @xmath0 7 years , whilst the co - added optical data is roughly 2 magnitudes deeper than a single epoch sdss measurement . although the baseline is small so the precision of a measurement of proper motion of a single star is still low , we can take advantage of the large number of sgr tracers to get a high precision ( @xmath11masyr@xmath1 ) measurement for the proper motion of the ensemble .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the extraction of proper motions for stars from the stripe 82 data using background quasars to provide an absolute reference frame .",
    "section 3 shows how to identify the sgr stars in stripe 82 , where they occupy a distinctive niche in magnitude and radial velocity space .",
    "section 4 discusses our modelling of the proper motions using both photometric and spectroscopic samples .",
    "we extract the proper motion for both the bright and faint sgr streams identified by @xcite . in section 5",
    ", we compare our proper motions both with the earlier work of @xcite and with the simulation data .",
    "stripe 82 has already been the subject of numerous studies .",
    "its multi - epoch and multi - band imaging allows study of the variable sky and identification of many kinds of transient phenomena  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the stripe 82 dataset has also been used to derive proper motions by @xcite .",
    "this light - motion catalogue was subsequently exploited to build reduced proper motion diagrams  @xcite and analyse kinematical properties of galactic disk and halo populations @xcite .",
    "even so , the proper motion measurements pioneered by @xcite can be improved . for the bulk proper motion of sgr",
    ", we are interested in the statistical properties of a large ensemble of faint tracers , so proper motions with the smallest possible systematic errors are highly desirable .",
    "the original catalogue by bramich does not provide proper motions for stars fainter than @xmath12 20.5 and is known to have some noticeable systematics . since the sgr stream has a very large number of tracers in stripe 82  @xcite , we do not require a proper motion measurement for every star , but rather need small systematic errors and well understood error - bars for an ensemble . for this purpose , it makes sense to measure the proper motions relative to quasars ( qsos ) .",
    "stripe 82 has a number of both spectroscopically and photometrically identified qsos . in this work",
    ", we have used the catalogue of spectroscopic qsos from @xcite and the sample of photometrically identified qsos from @xcite to extract denizens of stripe 82 .",
    "the purity of the spectroscopic catalogue of qsos is guaranteed  all the objects are qsos and must have zero proper motion .",
    "however , the photometric catalogue is known to have some contamination by stars . in order to minimize contaminants ,",
    "we use the cut good@xmath13 , as recommended by @xcite .",
    "this guarantees a small stellar contamination , certainly @xmath145% .",
    "given a sample of qsos each with zero proper motion , then for each star in the vicinity of the qso , we may determine proper motion relative to the quasar .",
    "as an input catalog for the stars , we took the stripe 82 co - add dataset @xcite , from which we select primary objects , classified by the sdss pipeline as stars .",
    "the individual source detections are taken from the stripe 82 portion of the sdss dr7 database @xcite using only those fields having acceptable and good data quality flags .",
    "matching co - added sources to detections at individual epochs is done with the 0.5 arcsec radius using the q3c module for the postgresql database @xcite .",
    "this procedure makes the catalogue incomplete for high proper motion objects ( with proper motions @xmath15 100 mas yr@xmath1 ) , but we are not interested in such objects in our current study .",
    "then , for each pair ( star , qso ) observed multiple times by sdss within one field , we analyse the positional offsets and errors . for the right ascension ,",
    "these are defined via @xmath16 with similar equations for the declination .",
    "the model for the positional offsets is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the proper motion of the star , @xmath19 is the date of the observation , @xmath20 is the fraction of outliers , and @xmath21 is the scatter around the linear relation , whilst @xmath22 is the rectangular function to account for the outliers .    the resulting likelihood",
    "is then minimized with respect to the 4 parameters @xmath18 , @xmath23 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 with the error - bars determined from the hessian at the minimum .",
    "repeating this procedure for the offsets in declination gives us the proper motions and their errors , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 for all the sources with a spectroscopic or a photometric qso nearby .",
    "after performing the computation of the proper motion for individual stars , and before trying to measure the statistical proper motions for ensembles of stars , it is important to check for the presence of possible systematics , as well as to examine the accuracy of the error bars .",
    "[ fig : qsocheck ] presents such an assessment . in this paper",
    ", we are focusing on the particular part of stripe 82 , which intersects with the sgr stream . as systematic effects",
    "may depend on the right ascension , fig .",

    "the red overplotted curve shows a gaussian with the center at zero and unity dispersion .",
    "the excellent match of the histogram with the gaussian curve shows that that the proper motions do not possess noticeable systematic offsets , and that the error bars on the proper motions are a faithful description of the precision .",
    "it is also quite clear from the plot that this is not true for proper motion measurements by @xcite , which have noticeable systematics and error underestimation .",
    "the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : qsocheck ] shows the the proper motion of the spectroscopic qsos relative to the photometric qsos versus the @xmath29 color difference .",
    "the points with error bars show the median proper motion in bins of @xmath29 , while the error bars are 1.48 times the median absolute deviation of proper motions within a corresponding @xmath29 bin . since all the points lie within 1 @xmath21 of zero , we conclude that the color - dependent terms in the proper motions are negligible down to the precision 0.1@xmath300.2 mas yr@xmath1 .",
    "this holds true at least within the color range @xmath31 , which is the color - range applicable to 99% percent of the photometric qsos .",
    "later we will see that the proper motion of the sgr stream determined from the photometric sample with @xmath32 , @xmath33 and the spectroscopic sample with @xmath34 , @xmath35 agree each other , further confirming the small level of color - related systematic errors . and",

    "as demonstrated above , in the southern galactic hemisphere , it is possible to achieve clean separation of the sgr trailing tail stars and the galactic foreground in both apparent magnitude and the radial velocity space .",

    "therefore , we choose to approximate these distributions by a sum of multi - dimensional gaussians .",

    "motivated by the evolution of the distance and the structure of the stream along the stripe , we split the msto sample into three parts : the faint stream at @xmath72 , the bright stream at @xmath73 , and the eastern wing of the bright stream at @xmath74 ( we label those fields as fp1 , fp2 , fp3 respectively ; they are shown by red error - bars on fig .",

    "<S> the multi - band photometry and sdss radial velocities allow us to efficiently select sgr members and thus enhance the proper motion precision to @xmath0 0.1masyr@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we measure separately the proper motion of a photometrically selected sample of the main sequence turn - off stars , as well as of a spectroscopically selected sgr giants . </S>",
    "<S> the data allow us to determine the proper motion separately for the two sgr streams in the south found in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> together with the precise velocities from sdss , our proper motion provide exquisite constraints of the 3-d motions of the stars in the sgr streams . </S>"
