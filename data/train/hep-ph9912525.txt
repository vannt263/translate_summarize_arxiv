    "the dilepton invariant mass has the kinematical interval @xmath149 in which the charmonium resonances can be excited .",
    "the dominant contribution comes from the three low  lying resonances @xmath150 in the interval @xmath151 . in order to minimize the hadronic uncertainties we will discard this subinterval in the analysis below by dividing the @xmath114 region to @xmath152 and @xmath153 dilepton mass intervals & & :  4 m_^2 q^2 8  gev^2 , + & & :  14.5  gev^2 q^2 ( m_b - m_k^)^2 , where the contribution of the higher resonances do still exists in the second region .",
    "due to @xmath154 factor in front of @xmath101 , in region i the contribution of the dipole type operator dominates .",
    "therefore , asymmetries which involve the differences of the decay rates are suppressed in region i compared to ones in region ii . this property will be illustrated in figs .",
    "1  2 and the remaining analysis for the asymmetries will be performed only for region ii where the asymmetries are larger .    as mentioned previously , in the model under concern",
    ", there are two weak phases : @xmath107 and @xmath141 .",
    "however , a close inspection of the cp asymmetry shows that , it is independent of @xmath141 .",
    "this follows from the fact that cp asymmetry can exist only when interference terms involve @xmath82 and @xmath83 phases . in this model ,",
    "similar to sm , there is no interference terms involving @xmath155 and @xmath3 .",
    "for this reason @xmath156 is independent of @xmath141 .",
    "first , we illustrate @xmath156 in @xmath157@xmath43 plane for @xmath146 decay for region i and region ii in fig . 1 and fig",
    ". 2 , respectively . in both figures",
    "we take @xmath158 , and as noted above @xmath156 is already independent of this phase . in region",
    "i the cp asymmetry is practically independent of @xmath114 , and becomes maximal for marginal cp violation , @xmath159 . in region",
    "ii , however , the @xmath114 dependence is comparatively enhanced as the dominance of dipole coefficient is now reduced .",
    "besides , as figures suggest the cp asymmetry in region ii is one order of magnitude larger than in region i , and this confirms our expectation above .",
    "one notes that the average asymmetries could be measured more easily in experiments .",
    "therefore , from now on we will discuss averaged cp and lepton polarization asymmetries in region ii .",
    "the averaging procedure is defined by    @xmath160    where @xmath161 or @xmath156 .    depicted in fig .",
    "4 ) is the @xmath107 dependence of the averaged asymmetries @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 at @xmath166 ( @xmath167 ) for @xmath146 decay .",
    "similarly , figs . 5 and 6 show the @xmath107 dependence of the same quantities for @xmath168 .",
    "as noted before , the cp asymmetry depends only on @xmath107 ; however , as these figures show clearly among all asymmetries @xmath73 is very sensitive to @xmath141 : for @xmath158 ( @xmath167 ) @xmath73 is purely positive ( negative ) .",
    "in addition to this , @xmath73 at @xmath167 is one order of magnitude larger than that at @xmath166 .",
    "this property is valid for both @xmath169 and @xmath170 final states . besides , since @xmath73 is proportional to the lepton mass , the @xmath147 decay is much more relevant for its measurement .",
    "this sensitivity of @xmath73 on @xmath141 can be explained as follows : @xmath73 depends on the imaginary part of the bilinear combinations of the wilson coefficients , such as @xmath171 $ ] . when @xmath172 ( @xmath158 ) @xmath3 is pure imaginary ( real ) and therefore @xmath173=|c_{10}| { \\rm re}[c_9^{eff}]$ ] ( @xmath174=|c_{10}| { \\rm im}[c_9^{eff}]$ ] ) .",
    "since @xmath175| > >",
    "|{\\rm im}[c_9^{eff}]|$ ] , @xmath73 at @xmath172 is roughly one order of magnitude larger than its value at @xmath158 .",
    "remaining two asymmetries , @xmath72 and @xmath74 , are less sensitive to @xmath141 .",
    "in fig.7 and 8 we present the correlation between @xmath176 and @xmath177 for @xmath178 decay by varying @xmath107 from 0 to @xmath179 at @xmath158 and @xmath172 , respectively . for @xmath169 channel",
    "@xmath180 is much smaller so we do not analyze this case .",
    "the sm predictions are given by the intersections of @xmath181 line and the curves themselves .",
    "due to the sign ambiguity of @xmath2 there are two solutions .",
    "all other points on the curves are generated by the new physics phases .",
    "if a simultaneous measurement of @xmath182 and @xmath177 gives a point on the curve and if this point is distinct from the sm prediction then this will be an indication of the new physics contribution .",
    "moreover , such a simultaneous measurement enables us to determine the sign of the new phases unambiguously .",
    "in this work we have adopted a model  independent approach in studying the sensitivity of the cp and lepton polarization asymmetries to new cp phases . in parcticular , we have taken the wilson coefficients being identical to the sm ones except for their phases .",
    "the main result of the present study is that the cp asymmetry and normal lepton polarization asymmetry are the most sensitive quantities to new sources of weak phases beyond the sm . while @xmath156 is sensitive to @xmath107",
    "only , @xmath73 is more sensitive to @xmath141 .",
    "therefore , measurement of these two asymmetries can establish the existence or absence of the new sources of cp violation beyond the sm .",
    "moreover , a simultaneous measurement of the averaged cp and normal polarization asymmetries will unambiguously determine the sign of the new phases .    in a specific model such as 2hdm or supersymmetry the wilson coefficients possess new cp phases not found in the sm .",
    "the question of how infromative the asymmetries in @xmath49 decay about new sources of cp violation in 2hdm model or supersymmetry will be discussed elsewhere .",
