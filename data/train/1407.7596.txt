    "thus , it seems unlikely that the scenario proposed by @xcite , requiring that at least one third of the galactic halo has been processed by population iii , massive stars , can work in the same way also in smaller systems like sgr and @xmath31 centauri ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "<S> the cosmological li problem is the observed discrepancy between li abundance ( @xmath0 ) measured in galactic dwarf , old and metal - poor stars ( traditionally assumed to be equal to the initial value @xmath1 ) , and that predicted by standard big bang nucleosynthesis calculations ( @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> here we attack the li problem by considering an alternative diagnostic , namely the surface li abundance of red giant branch stars that in a colour magnitude diagram populate the region between the completion of the first dredge - up and the red giant branch bump . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained high - resolution spectra with the flames facility at the very large telescope for a sample of red giants in the globular cluster m54 , belonging to the sagittarius dwarf galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath0=  0.93@xmath30.11 dex , translating  after taking into account the dilution due to the dredge up to initial abundances ( @xmath1 ) in the range 2.352.29  dex , depending on whether or not atomic diffusion is considered . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first measurement of li in the sagittarius galaxy and the more distant estimate of @xmath1 in old stars obtained so far . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 estimated in m54 is lower by @xmath40.35 dex than @xmath2 , hence incompatible at a level of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> our result shows that this discrepancy is a universal problem concerning both the milky way and extra - galactic systems . </S>",
    "<S> either modifications of bbn calculations , or a combination of atomic diffusion plus a suitably tuned additional mixing during the main sequence , need to be invoked to solve the discrepancy .    </S>",
