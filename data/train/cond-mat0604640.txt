    "it is perhaps surprising how many problems in chemistry , physics , and biology can be reduced to the simple model of diffusion over a barrier  @xcite .",
    "although chemical reactions in all phases of matter provide the prime example @xcite , a plethora of systems that evolve from suitably defined `` reactant '' to `` product '' states are amenable to a description in this framework @xcite .",
    "transition state theory ( tst ) @xcite or one of its descendants @xcite is often used to approximate the rate of these reaction processes .",
    "this theory is based on the assumption that the reaction rate is determined in a small volume of the phase space near the barrier .",
    "it is then possible to define a dividing surface separating reactants from products and obtain the rate from the flux through this surface .",
    "the optimal location of the dividing surface is that which minimizes the number of recrossings  the fundamental idea of variational transition state theory @xcite .",
    "when the system of interest can be viewed as isolated from its environment , as in low - density gas phase chemical reactions , tst may indeed provide an excellent approximation to the rate .",
    "however , most processes of interest do not take place in isolation , but rather in a complex environment where interactions between the system and its surroundings occur on time scales comparable to that of the reaction : in a reaction occurring in the condensed phase , for instance , the dynamics of the solute is strongly coupled to that of the solvent . in this case , the fundamental assumption of tst , that the dividing surface is crossed once and only once , no longer holds @xcite . on the time scale of the reaction event ,",
    "fluctuations of the environment will almost inevitably cause recrossings of the dividing surface that lead to an overestimation of the rate .    to overcome the recrossing problem , many ts dividing surfaces",
    "have been suggested in the literature @xcite which provide systematic ( and simple ) approximations to the optimal ts dividing surface . in some cases ,",
    "the dividing surface has been identified in the infinite - dimensional phase space consisting of the system and an explicit set of bath oscillators @xcite .",
    "this approach leads to an excellent approximation to the rate @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the same result was subsequently obtained without recourse to the explicit heat bath model , using instead a collective reaction coordinate containing the influence of the bath directly @xcite .    in a recent series of papers @xcite",
    ", we reformulated the recrossing problem using a dividing surface that is itself moving stochastically so as to avoid recrossings .",
    "the motion of that surface follows the unique trajectory named the ts trajectory that never leaves the barrier region .",
    "any reactive trajectory crosses the moving surface once and only once , whereas a nonreactive trajectory does not cross at all .",
    "this construction extends the approach of @xcite in that it provides not only a reaction coordinate , but also the complete geometric structure by specifying all of the unstable and stable degrees of freedom globally @xcite .",
    "the previous purely analytic studies @xcite are complemented here with a numerical investigation of the reaction dynamics for a two - dimensional stochastic nonlinear model .",
    "it will be shown that the moving dividing surface offers considerable computational advantages over the traditional fixed surface : its use can significantly reduce the simulation time required to distinguish between reactive and nonreactive trajectories .",
    "indeed , for a harmonic barrier it identifies reactive trajectories _ a priori _ , so that the need to simulate their dynamics does not arise at all . in an anharmonic system ,",
    "the identification of reactive trajectories by the moving surface is no longer exact .",
    "nevertheless , for moderately strong anharmonicities it provides a useful approximation , and its advantages over the fixed surface are retained .",
    "in addition , the moving ts surface introduces novel observables that characterize the reaction process on a microscopic level .",
    "most prominently , it allows one to define a unique reaction time for each individual trajectory .",

    "[ sec : prob ] , the ensemble of trajectories is specified by a thermal distribution of particles localized at the conventional tst dividing surface .",
    "this barrier ensemble is reminiscent of the weighting distribution in standard rate expressions and is appropriate even in nonlinear cases .",
    "its simple structure also readily leads to the analytic determination of several observables of the model system in the harmonic limit ( sec .",
    "[ sec : anal ] ) .",
    "they are in precise agreement with the numerical results presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "the latter section also demonstrates that observables converge faster when evaluated using the moving dividing surface rather than conventional numerical methods , both in the harmonic limit and in systems with anharmonic barriers .",
    "this observation is particularly useful in the anharmonic case when the chosen system is not amenable to analytic approaches .",
    "although the general theory is applicable to systems with an arbitrary number @xmath0 of degrees of freedom , the following discussion will be restricted to @xmath1 coordinates under the influence of a stochastic bath .",
    "this choice can be made without loss of generality because it exhibits all the salient features of the higher - dimensional cases : it can encompass an unbound ( reactive ) direction and a bound bath mode whose interaction with the reactive mode is strong enough to require its explicit description .",
    "the coupling of the modes is described by a taylor expansion about a transition point ( or col ) on the potential energy surface . such a model with a minimum number of nonlinear terms",
    "is described in this section .",
    "it will be used in the following to study the effect of increasing anharmonicity on the identification of reactive trajectories .    to set the stage for the following investigations ,",

    "we include a typical ( even ) higher - order nonlinear term and focus on the potential @xmath12 where the position vector is written as @xmath13 , and the constant @xmath14 quantifies the nonlinear coupling of the different degrees of freedom .",

    "for simplicitly , a particular instance of the noise has therefore been used to illustrate most of the results .",
    "nevertheless , the calculations presented here were repeated for several such noise sequences always leading to the same qualitative conclusions and thereby confirming that the results shown here are indeed typical .",

    "the analytic results derived here provide a benchmark against which the performance of the numerical calculations of sec .",

    "the onset of a similar behavior occurs at approximately the same value of @xmath163 for the moving dividing surface as well .",
    "this increase in the number of recrossings for both the fixed and the moving surfaces is caused by a small percentage of trajectories in the ensemble that never leave the ts region for negative times , but rather get trapped in an oscillation in the stable transverse degree of freedom @xmath21 .",

    "improved cpu performance can still be obtained if one recognizes that the average should be taken by sampling several trajectories for each noise sequence .",
    "apart from the insight into the microscopic reaction dynamics that the moving dividing surface offers , it consequently also provides computational advantages in the calculation of macroscopic observables .",
    "moreover , the computation can be readily parallelized because the algorithm is embarrasingly parallel when sampling across the trajectories associated with a given noise sequence .",
