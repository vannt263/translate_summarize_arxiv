    "in models of statistical disassembly of a nuclear system formed by the collision of two heavy ions at intermediate energy one assumes that because of multiple nucleon - nucleon collisions a statistical equilibrium is reached",
    ". the temperature rises .",
    "the system expands from normal density and composites are formed on the way to disassembly . as the system reaches between three to six times the normal volume ,",
    "the interactions between composites become unimportant ( except for the long range coulomb interaction ) and one can do a statistical equilibrium calculation to obtain the yields of composites at a volume called the freeze - out volume .",
    "the partitioning into available channels can be solved in the canonical ensemble where the number of particles in the nuclear system is finite ( as it would be in experiments ) . in some experiments ,",
    "the number of particles can fluctuate around a mean value .",
    "in such a case a sum of several canonical calculations could be appropriate . even when the number of particles is fixed one",
    "can hope to replace a canonical model calculation by a grand canonical model calculation where the particle number fluctuates but the average number can be constrained to a given value .",
    "the case we will look at corresponds to this situation .",
    "usually the grand canonical model is more easily solved .",
    "hence it is more commonly used although in the case of nuclear physics ( where particle numbers are typically @xmath0 200 or less ) the use of the canonical ensemble would be more appropriate .",
    "apart from ease of calculation , there is another reason why the grand canonical model is very useful .",
    "known properties of nuclear interactions predict that if nuclear systems were arbitrarily large ( consider a fictitious system where the coulomb interaction is switched off ) disassembly of nuclear systems would show features of liquid - gas phase transition @xcite . since the grand canonical ensemble is expected to become accurate for large systems , this would seem to be a suitable framework to describe bulk properties .",
    "the canonical model , built with a constant particle number in mind , can not be pushed to arbitrarily large particle number although it can be implemented for fairly big systems containing thousands of particles .",
    "one can then extraprolate from finite particle number systems to the infinite particle number case .",
    "when this was done , a huge difference showed up between grand canonical and canonical results for @xmath1 ( specific heat per particle at constant volume ) . in the grand canonical model",
    "@xmath1 was merely discontinuous at phase transition @xcite but in the canonical model @xmath1 would go to infinity as the system particle number approached infinity @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy was examined in detail for a system with 2000 particles @xcite .",
    "the analysis showed that in the co - existence region , even when the average number of particles is 2000 , fluctuations in the number of particles is huge if one uses the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "the @xmath1 with a fixed number of particles is sharply peaked at a temperature @xmath2 where @xmath2 is a function of the number of particles .",
    "because in the grand canonical ensmble the particle number fluctuations are significant when the average number is 2000 , the resulting @xmath1 is smeared out . what this analysis did not answer are two significant questions : ( a ) under what conditions are the grand canonical results valid and ( b ) under what conditions can the canonical and grand canonical results agree ?",
    "we answer both these questions in this work . the apparent paradox is explained .",
    "we also address the issue of bimodality in the probability distribution of the largest fragment as a function of the mass number of the largest fragment for a finite system when the thermodynamic model is used .",
    "clearly the canonical model is appropriate here but we also study bimodality in the grand canonical ensemble , where the average value of the number of particles is constrained to a typical value expected in heavy ion collisions . in the thermodynamic model",
    "it is easy to devise systems which may ( as in the nuclear matter case ) or may not ( i.e. , by switching off surface tension term in binding energy formula ) have a phase transition ( some other models may not have this versatility ) .",
    "thus in this model the connection of bimodality to phase transition can be directly established .",
    "it is interesting to note ( as described in detail later ) that both canonical model and the approximation of a finite system with the grand canonical model show features of bimodality but quantitatively the results are quite different .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we set up the the formulae for the grand canonical ensemble . in section",
    "iii the methodology of the canonical ensemble is presented .",
    "we point out that , although not obvious , the two ensembles actually addressed different physics causing the difference in results for specific heat . in section",
    "iv we reformulate the canonical model to better approximate the grand canonical model .",
    "we show that results for @xmath1 progressively converge .",
    "we then turn to the question of bimodality in the probability distribution of the largest fragment as a function of the fragment mass number .",
    "formulae for the probability distribution are given in section v. in section vi we present results for this distribution and discuss the bimodality in both the canonical and grand canonical ensembles .",
    "the connection between the probability distribution of the largest fragment and average multiplicity is established in section vii .",
    "summary is presented in section viii .    as in @xcite",
    "we use one kind of particle and no coulomb interaction .",
    "this is adequate for the purpose of this study and offers considerable numerical simplifications .",
    "numerous applications of the canonical @xcite and the grand canonical models @xcite with two kinds of particles exist where fits experimental data are the main issues .",
    "if we have @xmath3 particles of type @xmath4 , @xmath5 particles of type @xmath6 , @xmath7 particles of type @xmath8 etc . all enclosed in a volume @xmath9 and interactions between particles can be neglected , the grand partition function for this case can be written as @xmath10 here the @xmath11 is the chemical potential and @xmath12 the canonical partition function of one particle of type @xmath13 .",
    "the average number of particles of type @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 : @xmath15 it is possible that one of the species can be built from two other species . in reverse",
    ", a heavier species can also break up into two lighter species .",
    "if @xmath16 number of particles of type @xmath4 can combine with @xmath17 number of particles of type @xmath6 to produce @xmath18 number of particles of type @xmath8 , then chemical equilibrium implies @xcite that the chemical potentials of @xmath19 and @xmath8 are related by @xmath20 .",
    "in our model we have @xmath21 nucleons in a volume @xmath9 ( which is significantly larger than the normal nuclear volume ) but these nucleons can be singles or form bound dimers , trimers etc .",
    "chemical equilibrium implies that a composite with @xmath22 bound nucleons has a chemical potential @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the chemical potential of the monomer ( nucleon ) .",
    "thus our ensemble has monomers , dimers , trimers etc .",
    "upto some species with @xmath25 bound nucleons . in the actual world of nuclear physics",
    "@xmath25 terminates around 250 because of coulomb interaction but in the model pursued here we may terminate it arbitrarily at 1 ( monomers only ) , 2(monomers and dimers ) , 3 or any large @xmath25 .",
    "it was demonstrated in @xcite that liquid - gas type phase transition occurs for large @xmath26 .",
    "the total number of nucleons will be denoted by @xmath21 .",
    "of course , the grand canonical ensemble works best when @xmath21 is very large , ideally infinite .",
    "we now look into @xmath12 , the partition function of one composite of @xmath13 nucleons.this factors into two parts , a traditional translation energy part and an intrinsic part : @xmath27 where @xmath28 the intrinsic part @xmath29 of course contains the key to phase transition .",
    "if we regard each composite to exist only in a ground state with energy @xmath30 , then @xmath31 .",
    "we use @xmath32 where nuclear physics sets @xmath33=16 mev and @xmath34 mev . this simple model",
    "itself will lead to the main results of this paper .",
    "because of the surface term , energy per particle drops as @xmath13 grows .",
    "let us denote by @xmath35 the free energy of the @xmath21 nucleons where @xmath21 is the total number of nucleons ; @xmath36 be the energy and @xmath37 , the entropy : @xmath38 . at finite temperature @xmath35",
    "will go to its minimum value .",
    "the key issue is how the system of @xmath21 nucleons breaks up into clusters of different sizes as the temperature changes . at low temperature @xmath36 and",
    "hence @xmath35 minimises by forming very large clusters ( liquid ) .",
    "but as the temperature increases @xmath37 will increase by forming larger number of clusters thus breaking up the big clusters .",
    "gaseous phase will appear .",
    "how exactly this will happen requires calculation and these show that the system goes through a first order liquid - gas phase transition @xcite . as is the common practice , we used here a slightly more sophisticated model for @xmath29 .",
    "we make the surface tension temperature dependent in conformity with usual parametrisation @xcite ; @xmath39^{5/4}$ ] . here",
    "@xmath4018 mev and @xmath41=18 mev . at @xmath42 surface tension vanishes and we have a fluid only . for us",
    "this is unimportant as our focus will be the temperature range 3 to 8 mev .",
    "also in @xmath43 we include not only the ground state but also the excited states of the composite in the fermi - gas approximation @xcite .",
    "the expression for @xmath29 is now complete and easily tractable .",

    "@xmath48 is the average number of composites with @xmath22 nucleons . in the rest of the paper , for brevity",
    ", we will omit the qualifier `` average '' .",
    "a useful quantity is the multiplicity defined as @xmath49 the number of nucleons bound in a composite with @xmath22 nucleons is @xmath50 and obviously @xmath51 .",
    "the pressure is given by @xmath52 this follows from the identity @xmath53 .",
    "quantities like @xmath54 are all extensive variables .",
    "these equations can all be cast in terms of intensive variables like @xmath55 etc so that we can assume both @xmath21 and @xmath9 approach very large values and fluctuations in the number of particles can be ignored .",

    "the effect of this term is small .",
    "( 9 ) and ( 10 ) follow from the identity @xmath63 .    from what we have described so",
    "far it would appear that @xmath9 in eqs.(3 ) to ( 9 ) is the freeze - out volume @xmath9 , the volume to which the system has expanded .",
    "actually if the freeze - out volume is @xmath9 then in these equations we use @xmath64 which is close to @xmath9 but less .",
    "the reason for this is the following . to a good approximation",
    "a composite of @xmath22 nucleons is an incompressible sphere with volume @xmath65 where the value of @xmath66 is @xmath67 0.16 @xmath68 .",
    "the volume available for translational motion ( eq.(3 ) ) is then @xmath69 where we approximate @xmath70 the normal volume of a nucleus with @xmath21 nucleons .",
    "similar corrections are implicit in van der waals equation of state .",
    "this is meant to take care of hard sphere interactions between different particles .",
    "this answer is approximate .",
    "the correct answer is multiplicity dependent .",
    "the approximation of non - interacting composites in a volume gets to be worse as the volume decreases .",
    "we restrict our calculation to volumes @xmath9 greater than @xmath71 .",
    "this is how the calculations reported proceed .",
    "we choose a value of @xmath72 from which @xmath73 is deduced .",
    "this value of @xmath74 is used in eq.(8 ) to calculate @xmath24 and all other quantities .",
    "we plot results as function of @xmath75 .",
    "if we plotted them as function of @xmath76 the plot would shift to the right .",
    "the statistical equilibrium model as described above can be solved for a given fixed number of particles when the number of particles @xmath21 is finite .",
    "no spread in the number of particles , which is inherent in the grand canonical ensemble , needs to be made .",
    "extensive use of the canonical model has been made to fit experimental data @xcite so just an outline will be presented for completeness . among other applications",
    ", the canonical model can be used to study finite particle number effects on phase transition characteristics .",
    "consider again @xmath21 identical particles in an enclosure @xmath9 and temperature @xmath2 .",
    "these @xmath21 nucleons will combine into monomers , dimers , trimers etc .",
    "the partition function of the system in the canonical ensemble can be written as @xmath77 here @xmath12 is the one particle partition function of a composite which has @xmath13 nucleons .",
    "we already encountered @xmath12 in section ii : @xmath27 with @xmath78 and @xmath29 given in detail .",
    "other forms for @xmath12 can be used in the method outlined here .",
    "the summation in eq.(11 ) is over all partitions which satisfy @xmath79 .",
    "the summation is non - trivial as the number of partitions which satisfy the sum is enormous .",
    "we can define a given allowed partition to be a channel .",
    "the probablity of the occurrence of a given channel @xmath80 is @xmath81 the average number of composites of @xmath13 nucleons is easily seen from the above equation to be @xmath82 since @xmath83 , one readily arrives at a recursion relation @xcite @xmath84 for one kind of particle , @xmath85 above is easily evaluated on a computer for @xmath21 as large as 3000 in matter of seconds .",
    "it is this recursion relation that makes the computation so easy in the model . of course , once one has the partition function all relevant thermodynamic quantities can be computed .",
    "for example , eq .",
    "( 7 ) still gives the expression for pressure although one could correct for the center of mass motion by reducing the multiplicity by 1 : @xmath86 .",
    "the chemical potential can be calculated from @xmath87 where the free energy is @xmath88 which is readily available from the calculation .",
    "we first consider pressure ( eq.(7 ) ) in the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "the @xmath9 in eq.(7 ) cancels out the @xmath9 in eqs .",
    "( 4)and ( 5 ) and thus pressure is given in terms of intensive variables directly .",
    "we may assume that this is truly the pressure in infinite systems ( @xmath9 and @xmath48 arbitrarily large in which case fluctuations in the grand canonical ensemble can be ignored ) .",
    "however the grand canonical answer does depend upon the value of @xmath25 .",
    "in fig.1 we have used @xmath25=2000 , a value large enough so that liquid - gas transition type features emerge ( the flatness of pressure against @xmath89 ) . for @xmath25",
    "significantly lower , the flatness disappears ( see details in @xcite ) . in fig.1",
    "we also show several canonical model results all with the same @xmath25=2000 but different values of @xmath21 . for @xmath21=2000 ,",
    "the canonical results are quite different from the grand canonical results except for very low densities . in particular a region of mechanical instability",
    "is seen which can give rise to a region of negative @xmath90 , the specific heat per particle at constant pressure ( see @xcite for detailed discussion ) . in the same figure , we have also shown prssures in the canonical model when @xmath21=100,000 and 500,000 .",
    "we see that the pressure approaches the grand canonical value as @xmath21 increases ( the periodicity obvious in the curve for @xmath21= 100,000 arises from the fact the largest composite has @xmath912000 but we will not get into a detailed analysis here ) .",
    "the conclusion here is that the grand canonical value of pressure in fig.1 refers to a system which has @xmath92 where the largest cluster has @xmath93 .",
    "this is quite different from the usual canonical model result which would have @xmath94 . to address the physics of the grand canonical model we keep @xmath25 still at 2000 but need to keep on increasing the value of @xmath21 .",
    "then the canonical results converge towards the grand canonical values .    for this given problem",
    "we have approached the grand canonical result from a canonical ensemble .",
    "one can consider the reverse problem : getting the canonical result starting from the grand canonical model .",
    "it is of course obvious that the correspondence would be exact provided one uses the appropriate @xmath9 in the grand canonical ensemble and then projects from it the part which has an exact @xmath21 .",
    "this is because the grand canonical ensemble is a particular weighted sum of canonical ensembles with different @xmath21 s .",
    "let us now turn to fig.2 which deals with @xmath1 , the specific heat per particle at constant volume .",
    "we again keep @xmath95 .",
    "one finds that the @xmath1 in a canonical calculation for @xmath94 produces a very sharp peak .",
    "the grand canonical expression for energy per particle ( eq.(9 ) ) is an intensive quanity and so is its derivative @xmath1 .",
    "we expect this grand canonical result for @xmath1 is valid for @xmath21 very large .",
    "comparison shows that the grand canonical result differs drastically from the canonical @xmath21=2000 result in a very narrow window when the system passes from the co - existence to a pure gas phase .",
    "can we make the results converge by successively increasing the value of @xmath21 in the canonical model ?",
    "the answer is `` yes '' as fig.2 demonstrates .",
    "we see that the canonical result with @xmath25=2000 approaches the grand canonical result with @xmath25=2000 as the number of particles @xmath21 in the canonical calculations is progressively increased beyond @xmath21=2000 .    to summarise : the grand canonical model is applicable when @xmath96 .",
    "the limit @xmath97 is robust ( as shown in @xcite ) and produces a first order phase transition .",
    "this model is distinct from the canonical model @xmath98 .",
    "there is no scaling in this latter model:@xmath99 , both @xmath21 and @xmath25 very large is not equivalent within a factor of scaling to a system with @xmath100 .",
    "we are unable to provide a robust limit for the canonical model of @xmath101 .",
    "3 shows the progression of the @xmath102 and pressure curves as @xmath99 increases from 2000 to 50,000 .",
    "in event by event analysis in experiments , one can in principle ascertain the largest mass ( or the largest charge ) emerging in each event from multifragmentation .",
    "the probability distribution of this largest mass can be plotted as a function of the value of mass of this largest fragment .",
    "it is shown that a bimodality in this distribution at a certain temperature is a signature of a first order phase transition : that is , if the system were infinitely large it would have a first order phase transition @xcite .",
    "thus from a finite system one can have a signal for phase transition .",
    "we will now see how the probability distribution of the largest fragment as a function of the mass of the largest fragment can be computed in the thermodynamic model in the two ensembles .",
    "first the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "the grand canonical ensemble works best for a large system and we have already seen in the previous section that application of this model to multifragmentation of finite nuclei can lead to serious errors in some temperature ( equivalently energy ) window .",
    "nonetheless , let us proceed to see how results can be derived .",
    "we fix a value for @xmath75 ( in figs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) we have kept this at 0.25 ) and choose the appropriate value of the volume so that the average number @xmath103 is 150 , the system whose results we show .",
    "the heaviest composite allowed in the model @xmath25 is also 150 .    from eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) one can derive that the probability that a particular composite with @xmath22 nucleons does not occur at all is    @xmath104    and the probability that it occurs at least once or more is    @xmath105 .    note",
    "that our @xmath48 here is the same as @xmath48 s of eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , the average values in the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "the probability that @xmath22 is the highest mass fragment in an event is then given by ( @xmath106 ) @xmath107 from the above eq .",
    "one readily derives @xmath108 if @xmath109 then @xmath110 . if further both @xmath111 and @xmath48 are small compared to 1 then @xmath112 let us turn to the calculation of the probability disribution of the largest fragment as a function of the mass of the largest fragment in the canonical model . a detailed formulation when two kinds of particles are present was given in a recent paper @xcite but for competeness , we review the development.there is an enormous number of channels in eq.(11 ) .",
    "different channels will have different values for the largest fragment .",
    "for example there is a term @xmath113 in the sum of eq.(11 ) . in this channel",
    "all the fragments and hence also the largest fragment has mass 1 .",
    "the probability of this channel occurring is ( from eq.(12 ) ) @xmath114 .",
    "the full partition function can be written as @xmath115 . if we construct a @xmath85 where we set all @xmath116 s except @xmath117 to be zero then this @xmath118 and this has the largest mass 1 .",
    "consider now constructing a @xmath85 with only two @xmath116 s : @xmath119 .",
    "this will have the largest mass sometimes 1 ( as @xmath113 is still there ) and sometimes 2 ( as , for example , in the term @xmath120 .",
    "it then follows that @xmath121 in the above the first term in the numerator takes care of the occurrence of all partitions where the largest fragment is between 1 and @xmath22 and the second term takes care of all the partitions where the largest fragment is between 1 and @xmath122 .",
    "the difference , divided by @xmath85 is the desired answer .    since one has the general formula for the probability @xmath123 , one can compute the average value of the mass of the largest fragment as well as the root mean square deviation .",
    "in fact , these have been measured in some experiments @xcite and have recently been calculated @xcite .",
    "but we will not need this for this paper .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath123 of the largest fragment as a function of @xmath22 where @xmath22 is the largest fragment in an event is shown in fig.(4 ) where the freeze - out density @xmath75 is 0.25 and the dissociating system has @xmath21=150 ( for the grand canonical ensemble the average value is 150 ) .",
    "the canonical and grand canonical results are quite different but both display bimodality ( there are two maxima with similar heights ) , the grand canonical at temperature @xmath124 mev and the canonical at temperature @xmath125 mev . in fig.(5 ) we have compared the @xmath48 s of the two models . near the end value 150 the differences are very substantial at all temparatures . at lower values of @xmath22",
    "they agree very well at @xmath126 6.8 mev , quite well at @xmath2=6.2 mev but gets worse at lower temperatures becoming quite different at @xmath2=5.0 mev .",
    "these differences have been noted and discussed before @xcite .",
    "the very first experiments in heavy ion collisions measured @xmath48 , the average multiplicity against @xmath22 .",
    "one of the earliest postulates was the following . at low energy @xmath48",
    "first falls with @xmath22 but after reaching a minimum rises again .",
    "this is the so - called `` u '' shape .",
    "this shape at lower temperature is an indication that the system will undergo a liquid - gas type phase transition . as the energy of collision increases , the height of the maximum on the heavier side will decrease , will then disappear ( this marks the phase transition temperature ) . at higher energy ,",
    "@xmath48 decreases monotonically with @xmath22 .",
    "this is discussed in many places including @xcite .",
    "basically then one looks at the behaviour of @xmath48 as a function of @xmath22 and energy as one signature of phase transition . since bimodality in the probability distribution is also a signature of phase transition , we hope to get a connection between @xmath123 and @xmath48 .    for bimodality one",
    "requires that after the minimum following the first maximum , @xmath123 will rise again witk @xmath22 . similarly in conjectures involving the multiplicity , @xmath48 , after reaching a minimum must rise again with @xmath22 .",
    "these two features are intimately related . in the grand canonical model",
    "this is very simple to prove .",
    "equation ( 16 ) shows that if @xmath109 then @xmath110 and bimodality can happen .",
    "the reverse is not true ; @xmath127 does not imply that @xmath128 is less than @xmath123 .",
    "there is similar connection in the canonical model . here",
    "it can be proven that on the heavier side @xmath129 , a rise of @xmath48 with @xmath22 guarantees that @xmath123 will rise with @xmath22 .",
    "in fact it is even more direct than that . for @xmath129",
    ", we have an equality ; @xmath130",
    ". this can be proven from eq . ( 18 ) but there is a an easier proof .",
    "we can rewrite @xmath123 as a sum of terms : @xmath131 where in each of the terms in the right hand side @xmath22 is the highest mass that occurs but in @xmath132 the composite @xmath22 occurs only once , in @xmath133 it occurs twice , in @xmath134 it occurs three times and so on . specifically ,    @xmath135    @xmath136    it is clear what the structures for higher terms in the series will be .",
    "it is then also obvious that @xmath137 in the above , @xmath138 stands for other channels where mass @xmath22 occurs but it is not the highest mass in the channel . if @xmath129 then only @xmath132 exists .",
    "thus for @xmath129 we have @xmath130 .",
    "if @xmath48 rises with @xmath22 in this region then so does @xmath123 .",
    "for @xmath139 , the relationship is @xmath140 , with @xmath48 usually significantly larger than @xmath123 . for bimodality",
    "to exist we need to have @xmath141 rising with @xmath22 in some region @xmath129 .",
    "the relation @xmath130 for @xmath129 is not limited to the thermodynamic model only .",
    "it is true in any number conserving model .",
    "this paper had two goals .",
    "one , to resolve and understand the difference between grand canonical and canonical values of specific heat and pressure in thermodynamic models as applied to heavy ion collisions . this issue we believe is resolved .",
    "second , to understand the link between bimodality in the distribution of the heaviest fragment and the average multiplicity of fragments ( which has also been linked with aspects of phase transition ) .",
    "we think we have gained an understanding . in a later publication",
    "we expect to show more results for bimodal distributions for realistic cases with two kinds of particles and the coulomb interactions included .",
    "calculations for a particular case have already appeared @xcite .",
