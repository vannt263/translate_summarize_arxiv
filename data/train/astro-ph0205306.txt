    "the advent of high sensitivity cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) experiments will soon allow detailed observational studies on the cmb polarization field .",
    "in addition to a confirmation of the basic picture on how anisotropies were generated during the recombination era @xcite , cmb polarization observations , at large angular scales , may allow a measurement of the reionization redshift based on excess power created during the rescattering of cmb quadrupole at the reionization surface @xcite .",
    "an additional use of polarization observations is the potential detection of inflationary gravitational waves based on its contribution to the so - called curl or b - modes of polarization @xcite .",
    "in addition to primordial contributions involving density perturbations , which contribute solely to e - modes , and tensor modes or gravitational waves , the polarization field one observes today also contains secondary contributions associated with the large scale structure .",
    "this is similar to well known secondary contributions that dominate the small scale temperature anisotropy signal @xcite . in the case of b - modes ,",
    "the arcminute scale polarization is dominated by a fractional conversion of the dominant e - mode contribution via the gravitational lensing angular deflection of cmb photons @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we discussed an approach to separate the gravitational - wave signature in b - modes from the dominant , and contaminant , weak lensing contribution at arcminute scales .",
    "we also investigated limits on gravitational wave b - mode detection after a model - independent lensing substraction .",
    "this calculation followed previous discussions in the literature on how cmb data can be used for an extraction of statistics involving the gravitational lensing effect , such as shear or deflection angles @xcite .",
    "in general , the reconstruction of lensing deflections from cmb data require a priori information on the primordial cmb contribution at the last scattering surface .",
    "this knowledge can not easily be obtained from data alone since the cmb contribution measured today involve contributions resulting from secondary effects and any modifications during the transit to us from the last scattering surface . on the other hand",
    ", we can consider an alternative approach to an analogous problem involving a reconstruction of the primordial cmb contribution , at the last scattering surface , by accounting for modifications due to large scale structure .",
    "this is , effectively , an inverse problem from what was discussed in @xcite and require prior information related to the lensing effect on cmb , such as the mass distribution of large scale structure in which photons propagated . in the present study , we briefly discuss this possibility using a tracer field of the large scale structure potentials that deflected cmb photons via the gravitational lensing effect .",

    "we summarize our main results in figure  1 for the extraction of primordial polarization power spectra based on information related to lensing modification to cmb anisotropies . for the reconstruction , we assume a gravitational - wave contribution to b - modes with a tensor - to - scalar ratio of 0.25 and assume no instrumental - noise contributions to polarization observations today .",
    "when calculating noise , we include additional secondary noise contribution from lensing to @xmath13 and @xmath14 maps . for simplicity , we also take a tracer field , @xmath15 , that corresponds to lensing potentials themselves .",
    "thus , signal - to - noise ratios shown in figure  1 should be considered as optimistic values .",
    "any noise contribution to polarization observations and a tracer field which is less correlated with @xmath6 will lead to a degradation in the signal - to - noise ratios of primordial polarization reconstruction from the ones shown here .    with @xmath68 ,",
    "the assumption here is that one can use a properly cleaned cmb temperature map to reconstruct lensing deflections following the approach in @xcite and apply such a construction to polarization observations to reduce contamination from lensing to gravitational - wave detection .",
    "we include a noise - contribution to the @xmath15 field , when calculating @xmath63 , following the noise calculation for @xmath6 extracted from a no instrumental - noise cmb temperature map in ref .",
    "additionally possibilities for @xmath15 include a frequency cleaned sz map , a map of the convergence from large scale structure lensing observations , the galaxy distribution from surveys such as sloan but imaging out to a higher redshift ; since contributions to lensing in cmb comes at redshifts of a few and more , in general , a tracer field out to redshifts of @xmath69 3 to 5 will be required to appropriately apply this method .",
    "as suggested , the primordial polarization construction is more important for b - modes , given that they contain the distinct signature of gravitational waves , than e - modes . for the extraction of the b - mode power spectrum",
    ", we estimate a cumulative signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath69 16 .",
    "the cumulative signal - to - noise for the detection of this contribution , under the assumption that the contaminant lensing contribution can be treated as a known source of noise , is of order @xmath69 40 .",
    "the suggested reconstruction here leads to a roughly a factor of @xmath69 2.5 decrease in the associated signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the reconstruction , however , has the advantage that one does not need to make any assumptions on the lensing contribution to the power spectrum of b - modes . relaxing our assumption of a tensor - to - scalar ratio of 0.25",
    ", we find that the suggested extraction can be used to separate primordial b - modes with at least a signal - to - noise ratio of 1 when the tensor - to - scalar ratio is of order 0.01 .",
    "though we have not separated individual signal - to - noise values , the reconstruction of b - modes has less noise with the combination of @xmath42 statistic correlated with a map of b - modes instead of @xmath41 correlated with b - modes .",
    "this is because the dominant noise associated with e - modes in @xmath41 limit the reconstruction of @xmath17-modes significantly .",
    "the signal - to - noise values for the reconstruction of @xmath16-modes have similar values whether @xmath41 or @xmath42 is used .",
    "this reconstruction has a cumulative signal - to - noise in excess of @xmath70 both due to its high contribution and the fact that @xmath16-mode power spectrum peak at arcminute scales compared to @xmath17-mode power spectrum which peaks at degree scales .",
    "it is clear that the reconstruction analysis can be best done for the extraction of primordial @xmath16-modes .",
    "the low signal - to - noise values for @xmath17-modes , however , should not discourage from attempting to do analysis like the one suggested here in upcoming cmb data .",
    "the ultimate , and challenging , detection of gravitational wave signature , which , in principle , gives a handle on the inflationary energy scale requires various statistical techniques so that this contribution can be identified confusion free .",
    "since lensing contribution dominates the b - mode signal , we have exploited its use as a possible way to extract primordial polarization field .",
    "given the importance of detecting gravitational waves for future cosmological studies , statistics such as the one discussed are clearly warranted for further studies .",
