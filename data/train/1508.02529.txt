    "<S> this smearing of the shoulder structures and also the narrowing of the low - temperature resonance lines with increasing doping level are surprising and can not be explained by the simple approach to @xmath47 mentioned above .    at low enough temperatures , the lam </S>",
    "<S> is predicted to extend over the whole chain segment and the assumption of the semi - infinite chain is no longer valid @xcite . due to the high impurity content , </S>",

    "<S> however , it is not expected to result in a reduced width as compared to the @xmath38 behavior or even a disappearance of the shoulder features . </S>",

    "<S> these attempts failed . </S>",
    "<S> see appendices for details . ]    usually , the magnitude of a spin gap is estimated by fitting the temperature dependence of @xmath5 to an activated behavior @xcite and using the activation energy as an estimate for the spin gap . however , in our case , the spin - lattice relaxation rates do not decrease exponentially [ see the inset of ] . </S>",
    "<S> this can be attributed to the spatial distribution of spin gaps , because the fast relaxation stemming from nuclei exposed to small gaps will dominate the recovery process at low temperatures . </S>",
