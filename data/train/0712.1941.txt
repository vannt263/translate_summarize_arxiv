    "in _ collinear factorization _ the cross section for a parton - parton subcollision is given by @xmath0 ( note that one hard subcollision corresponds to 2 jets . ) the partonic cross section @xmath1 behaves like @xmath2 for small @xmath3 , which means that a lower cutoff , @xmath4 , is needed .",
    "the total subcollision cross section is then proportional to @xmath5 , and for @xmath6-collisions the subcollision cross section becomes equal to the total cross section for @xmath7 2.5 gev at the tevatron and @xmath8 5 gev at lhc @xcite .",
    "fits to data give @xmath9 2 gev at the tevatron and slowly growing with energy @xcite .    in _ @xmath10-factorization",
    "_ there is a dynamic cutoff when the momentum exchange @xmath10 is smaller than the virtuality of the two colliding partons , given by @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this approach gives a very similar effect .",
    "thus we conclude that at high energies the subcollision cross section is much larger than the total inelastic cross section , which means that on average there must be several hard subcollisions in one event .",
    "it was also early suggested that the increase in @xmath13 is driven by hard parton - parton subcollisions @xcite .",
    "besides from independent multiple subcollisions , multijet events can also originate from multiple bremsstrahlung from two colliding partons .",
    "if we study four - jet events the difference between these two types of events is that in a double parton scattering the four jets balance each other pairwise in the transverse momentum plane , while such a pairwise balance is not present in the multiple bremsstrahlung events .",
    "the axial field spectrometer at the isr proton - proton collider @xcite studied an `` imbalance parameter '' @xmath14 , \\label{eq : imbalance}\\ ] ] and found that there is a significant enhancement of events with small values of @xmath15 , which thus showed a clear evidence for multiple subcollisions .",
    "similar , but less clear , results for four - jet events have been observed by the cdf @xcite and d0 @xcite experiments at the tevatron . a more clear signal for multiple collisions at the tevatron has instead been seen in events with three jets + @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "evidence for multiple collisions has also been observed in photoproduction by the zeus collaboration at hera @xcite .",
    "an inportant question is whether the hard subcollisions are correlated , or if a high @xmath3 event just cooresponds to two jets on top of a minimum bias event .",
    "if the subcollisions are uncorrelated the probability , @xmath17 , for having @xmath18 subcollisions should be described by a poisson distribution .",
    "this implies that @xmath19 here the factor 1/2 is compensating for double counting .",
    "expressed in the cross sections @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 is the inelastic non - diffractive cross section ) this gives the relation @xmath22 .",
    "the experimental groups have used the notation @xmath23 which means that @xmath24 corresponds to uncorrelated subcollisions .",
    "the experimental results on four - jet events referred to above find , however , that @xmath25 is much smaller than @xmath21 .",
    "thus at isr one finds ( for jets with @xmath26 gev ) @xmath27 mb compared to @xmath28 mb , cdf finds for four - jet events ( @xmath29 gev ) and 3 jets+@xmath16 the results @xmath30 mb and @xmath31 mb respectively , to be compared with @xmath32 mb .",
    "this means that if there is one subcollision there is an enhanced probability to have also another one .",
    "a possible interpretation is that in central collisions there are many hard subcollisions , while there are fewer subcollisions in a peripheral collison .",
    "another sign of correlations is the observation that in events with a high @xmath3 jet the underlying event is enhanced , the so called _ pedestal effect_. the ua1 collaboration at the spps collider studied the @xmath33-distribution in @xmath34 around a jet @xcite . to avoid the recoiling jet they looked in @xmath35 in azimuth on the same side as the jet .",
    "the result is that for jets with @xmath36 gev the background level away from the jet is roughly a factor two above the level in minimum bias events .",
    "similar results have been observed in resolved photoproduction by the h1 collaboration @xcite .",
    "rick field has made very extensive studies of the underlying event at the tevatron ( see e.g. ref .",
    "he has here tuned the pythia mc to fit cdf data , and found tunes ( e.g. tune a and tune dw ) which give very good fits to essentially all data .",
    "in particular he has looked at the @xmath33-flow , the charged particle density , and @xmath3-spectra in angular regions perpendicular to a high-@xmath3 jet .",
    "one noticeable result is that the charged multiplicity in this `` transverse '' region grows rapidly with the @xmath3 of the trigger jet up to @xmath37 , and then levels off for higher jet energies at twice the density in minimum bias events .",
    "also the charged particle spectrum has a much higher tail out to large @xmath3 in events with a high @xmath3 jet , compared to the distribution in minimum bias events .",
    "the multiple collisions have a very important effect in the mc simulations , and the data can not be reproduced if they are not included .",
    "the version of the pythia mc used by field is an implementation of an early model by sjstrand and van zijl @xcite . in this model",
    "it is assumed that high energy collisions are dominated by hard parton - parton subcollisions , and also minimum bias events are assumed to have at least one such subcollision . to be able to reproduce the observed pedestal effect , the parton distribution is assumed to have a more dense central region , and is described by a sum of two ( three - dimensional ) gaussians . for fixed impact parameter , @xmath38 ,",
    "the number of subcollisions is assumed to be given by a poisson distribution , with an average proportional to the overlap between the parton distributions in the two colliding protons .",
    "integrated over the impact parameter this gives a distribution which actually can be well approximated by a geometric distribution , that is a distribution with much larger fluctuations than a poisson .",
    "the pythia model does not include diffraction , and describes only non - diffractive inelastic collisions .",
    "diffraction is related to the fluctuations via the agk cutting rules @xcite . in qcd",
    "a single pomeron exchange can be represented by a gluon ladder .",
    "the diagram for double pomeron exchange can be cut through zero , one and two of the exchanged pomerons , with relative weights 1 , @xmath39 , and 2 .",
    "if we add the contributions to @xmath40 cut pomerons from diagrams with an arbitrary number of exchanged pomerons , then we get for @xmath41 with the weights in ref @xcite a poisson distribution . for fixed impact parameter",
    "the assumptions in the pythia model are thus in agreement with the agk rules .",
    "although field s tunes of the pythia model give good fits to data , there are still problems .",
    "the relation between transverse energy and hadron multiplicity is not what has been expected . in the agk paper a cut pomeron",
    "was expected to give a chain of hadrons between the remnats of the two colliding hadrons , and two cut pomerons should give two such chains and therefore doubled particle density .",
    "this is in contrast to the cdf data , where @xmath33 grows more than the multiplicity in multiple collision events .",
    "the original agk paper was published before qcd , and based on a multiperipheral model .",
    "however , also in qcd the dglap or bfkl dynamics gives color - connected chains of gluons . in the hadronization process",
    "the gluon exchange ought to give two triplet strings ( or cluster chains ) stretching between the projectile remnants , and in the spirit of agk two cut pomerons should give four such triplet strings .",
    "field s tunes seem instead to indicate some kind of color recombination which reduces the effective string length .",
    "( similar recombinations have been studied by ingelman and coworkors @xcite . )    in the pythia model used by field different possibilities for the color connection between the partons involved are studied .",
    "the most common parton subcollisions are @xmath43 , and as mentioned above this is expected to give two strings between the projectile remnants .",
    "initial state radiation gives extra gluons , for which the color ordering agrees with the ordering in rapidity .",
    "therefore these emissions do not increase the total string length very much , and as a consequence they increase @xmath33 more than they increase the hadron multiplicity .    from the experimental data it was noted already in ref .",
    "@xcite that two subcollisions could not give doubled multiplicity , as expected from four strings as discussed above .",
    "it was therefore assumed that the second subcollision could give a just single double string connecting the two outgoing gluons .",
    "another option was replacing the gluons by a @xmath44 pair , connected by a single triplet string .",
    "this reduces the multiplicity even further .",
    "a third possibility was to assume that color rearrangment caused the scattered gluons to fit in the color chains of the first collision , in such a way that the total string length was increased as little as possile .",
    "this gives a minimal additional multiplicity , and in this case the multiple collisions have an effect on the total @xmath33 and multiplicity similar to the bremsstrahlung gluons ( but the jets are balanced pairwise in transverse momentum ) .",
    "the default assumption in ref .",
    "@xcite was to give each of these possibilities the same probability , 1/3 . in field",
    "s successful tunes these ratios are changed , such that the last option with color reconnection is chosen in 90% of the cases .    in a more recent study by sjstrand and",
    "skands @xcite a number of improvents have been added to the old pythia model .",
    "the hope was that with these modifications it would be possible to describe data without the extreme color reconnections which have no real theoretical motivation in qcd .",
    "their result is , however , discouraging , as they were not able to tune the new model to give the relation beween @xmath3 and multiplicity observed in the data .",
    "we have to conclude that something important is missing in our understanding of high energy collisions .",
    "although , in the agk paper , pomeron interactions are assumed to give small contributions , pomeron vertices ( see e.g. @xcite ) and pomeron loops may be very important . as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pomerons]a , a pomeron loop can give a bump in the particle density if both branches of the loop are cut , and a gap if the cut passes between the two branches .",
    "it is also conceivable that such gaps and bumps have to be included in a `` renormalized '' pomeron @xcite .    in qcd",
    "a pomeron is formed by two gluons in a color singlet .",
    "two pomeron exchange thus corresponds to four gluons in two singlet pairs .",
    "if the pairs ( 1,2 ) and ( 3,4 ) form singlets , then gluon exchange can change the system so that instead the pairs ( 1,3 ) and ( 2,4 ) form color singlets .",
    "this corresponds to an effective @xmath45 coupling ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . a cut with gluons 1 and 2 on one side and 3 and 4 on the other",
    "can then give an isolated bump in the particle density , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pomerons]b .",
    "this type of pomeron interactions can also give a bound state @xcite , which gives a pole in the angular momentum plane and an essential correction to the normal cut from the exchange of two uncorrelated pomerons .",
    "we conclude that there are still many open questions .",
    "more experimental information is needed , and to gain insight into the dynamics it is important to go beyond inclusive observables , and study observables related to correlations and fluctuations .",
    "multiple scattering and rescattering is more easily treated in transverse coordinate space . in mueller s dipole cascade model",
    "@xcite a color dipole formed by a @xmath44 pair in a color singlet is split into two dipoles by gluon emission .",
    "each of these dipoles can split repeatedly into a cascade , see fig .",
    "[ fig : dipev]a .",
    "the probability per unit rapidity for a split is proportional to @xmath46 .",
    "when two dipole chains collide , gluon exchange between two dipoles implies exchange of color and a recoupling of the chains , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dipev]b .",
    "the probability for an interaction between two dipoles @xmath47 and @xmath48 , @xmath49 , is proportional to @xmath50 , and is thus formally color suppressed compared to the dipole splitting process .    in the eikonal approximation",
    "the total scattering probability is determined by the expression @xmath51 , which is always smaller than 1 and thus satisfies the constraints from unitarity . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : multichain]a , multiple dipole - dipole interactions can imply that the color dipoles form closed loops , which correspond to the pomeron loops in fig .",
    "[ fig : pomerons]a .",
    "mueller s model includes those pomeron loops , which correspond to cuts in the particular lorentz frame used for the calculation , but not loops which are fully inside one of the colliding cascades .",
    "this implies that the formalism is not lorentz frame independent , and different ways have been suggested to achieve a frame independent formulation ( see e.g. refs .",
    "however , so far no explicitely frame independent formalism has been presented .    in one approach the evolution",
    "is expressed in terms of _ interacting _ dipoles .",
    "this implies that the number of dipoles can be reduced , and the evolution of the projectile cascade depends on the target . besides the @xmath52 dipole vertex there",
    "should here also be a @xmath53 vertex . in another approach",
    "the evolution of the projectile is independent of the target , and the non - interacting dipoles are eliminated afterwards . in this approach there is no need to reduce the number of dipoles in the evolution .",
    "_ dipole swing _    a model based on the latter approach is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this",
    "model pomeron loops can be formed with the help of a recoupling of the dipole chains , a `` dipole swing '' .",
    "just as the dipole - dipole scattering , the pomeron loops in the cascades should be color suppressed . with a finite number of colors",
    "we can have not only dipoles but also higher color multipoles .",
    "two charges and two anticharges with the same color may be better approximated by two dipoles formed by nearby charge - anticharge pairs .",
    "these pairs may be different from the initially generated dipoles , and the result is a recoupling of the dipole chain , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : multichain]b . the same effect can also be obtained from gluon exchange , which is proportional to @xmath54 and thus also color suppressed cf . to the dipole splitting proportional to @xmath55 .",
    "the swing does not result in a reduction of the number of dipoles , but the saturation effect is obtained as the recoupled dipoles are smaller and therefore have smaller cross sections",
    ". inserted in a mc the result is approximately frame independent , and the model describes well both the @xmath56 structure function in dis and the @xmath6 scattering cross section @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] .",
    "( for these results also energy conservation and a running @xmath54 are very important @xcite . )",
    "we see here that the @xmath57 cross section satisfies geometric scaling .",
    "the @xmath6 cross section is reduced by about a factor 4 cf . to the one pomeron exchange at the tevatron , and we also see that the result of the model is the same when calculated in the cms as in the rest frame of the target proton , if pomeron loops are included also in the evolution via the dipole swing .",
    "total cross section obtained from the model in the result is plotted as a function of the scaling variable @xmath58 , where @xmath59 with @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "_ right _ : the total @xmath6 scattering cross section .",
    "results are presented for evolution with and without the dipole swing mechanism .",
    "the one pomeron result and the result obtained in a frame where one of the protons is almost at rest are also shown.,title=\"fig : \" ]    total cross section obtained from the model in the result is plotted as a function of the scaling variable @xmath58 , where @xmath59 with @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 . _",

    "this gives in total 3.5 loops . at lhc",
    "we obtain in the same way in total an average of 5 loops .    using the eikonal approximation it is besides total cross sections also possible to calculate elastic scattering and diffractive excitation @xcite , but",
    "so far it has not been possible to calculate exclusive final states .",
    "the aim for the future is to bridge the gap between dipole cascades , agk , and traditional mc generators , and construct an event generator fully compatible with unitarity and the agk cutting rules .",

    "the dipole formalism can describe @xmath63 loops and diffraction .",
    "the application of agk cutting rules then imply the presence of rapidity gaps .",
