    "the development of optical trapping techniques for bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) has enabled the confinement of atoms independently of their spin orientation in so - called _ spinor condensates _",
    "diverse experimental and theoretical activities had aimed to characterise the effect of the spin degree of freedom on the macroscopic quantum state . a multitude of exciting phenomena which are not present in a single component bec have been revealed .",
    "these include spin textures  @xcite , spin domain formation  @xcite and multi - component solitons  @xcite .",
    "one of the most frequently used optical traps for ultra - cold matter is an optical lattice , i.e.  a  standing light wave far detuned from the atomic resonance .",
    "however , up to now , the effect of the spin degree of freedom on the key properties of becs in periodic potentials has not been fully explored .",

    "bragg scattering of matter waves with repulsive atomic interactions can reverse the effective diffraction properties of the bec wavepackets and lead to formation of localized states with energy eigenvalues within the gaps of the linear bloch - wave spectrum of the lattice [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : bgd](a , b ) ] .",
    "two types of such localized structures have been studied in the recent years - _ gap solitons _ and _ self - trapped states_. single component gap solitons in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) lattice have been extensively studied theoretically  @xcite and observed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "two - component gap solitons in lattices have also been investigated @xcite .",
    "these nonlinearly localized states are restricted to low particle numbers .",
    "in contrast , the experimentally observed self - trapped states @xcite can confine large number of condensate atoms @xcite , and can be interpreted as _ gap waves _ - truncated bloch states that link gap solitons with spatially extended nonlinear bloch waves in the lattice @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present a detailed analysis of the nonlinear localization of spinor ( three - component ) becs in the presence of a 1d lattice , within the framework of the mean - field theory .",
    "we consider bec clouds with either a _",
    "ferromagnetic _ ( @xmath4 ) or _ polar _ ( @xmath5 ) spin - dependent interaction , and show that the lattice enables the existence of multi - component localized states of both types of the spinor condensates .",
    "we show that the spinor states in both of the two condensate types may be localized as _ vector gap solitons _ that can exhibit either ferromagnetic or polar spin structures regardless of the type of spin - dependent interaction .",
    "in addition , we find and characterise the multi - component self - trapped gap states that naturally extend the concept of single - component self - trapped gap waves @xcite .",
    "both the spinor gap solitons and gap waves can be adequately described within the _ single - mode approximation _ ( sma ) which assumes that all components of the composite localized state share the same spatial profile .",
    "however , we also reveal that both gap solitons and gap wave states may exist simultaneously in different spin components forming a hybrid localized state , which no longer satisfies the sma .",
    "such composite states may exhibit effects of self - magnetisation and internal josephson - like dynamics @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we consider non - stationary dynamics of the spinor gap solitons and examine two distinct methods to induce coherent spin - mixing oscillations , through a change in the relative phase of the condensate , or through a population imbalance in a stationary state configuration .",

    "finally , we demonstrate that application of a magnetic field @xcite can arrest the spin mixing , which lays the foundations for controlled and flexible state manipulation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : model ] , where we introduce our model is followed by section  [ sec : states ] in which basic properties of stationary states are analysed . in section  [ sec : bloch ] we examine the dynamical instability of spinor bloch waves and spinor matter wave localization",
