    "the observation of surface cooling of accreting neutron stars on timescales of days to years after they go into quiescence has opened up a new window on the physics of neutron star crusts .",
    "six neutron stars in low mass x - ray binaries have now been observed to cool after extended accretion outbursts that were long enough to heat the crust significantly out of thermal equilibrium with the core @xcite .",
    "the subsequent thermal relaxation of the crust depends on its physical properties such as its thickness , thermal conductivity , and heat capacity , with deeper regions being probed at successively later times in the cooling light curve ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bc09 ) .",
    "@xcite and bc09 showed that the observed cooling curves of ks  1731260 and mxb  165929 imply that the inner crust has a thermal conductivity corresponding to an impurity parameter of order unity .",
    "@xcite find that the cooling curve of xte j1701462 is compatible with similar crust microphysics to ks  1731260 and mxb  165929 .",
    "chemical separation occurs when , as a material freezes , the equilibrium compositions of the liquid and solid phases are different .",
    "this important process can drive sedimentation or mixing in white dwarf @xcite and giant planet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) interiors , and earth s core @xcite .",
    "@xcite carried out molecular dynamics simulations of the freezing of the multicomponent plasma expected in the outer layers of accreting neutron stars , and found chemical separation occurred , with lighter nuclear species being preferentially retained in the liquid phase . in a previous paper ( * ? ? ? * hereafter mc11 ) we considered the effect of chemical separation while accretion is ongoing . in that case , as matter is driven to higher pressure and crosses the freezing depth , the light elements released into the neutron star ocean will drive convection , mixing them throughout the ocean and raising the light element fraction . at the same time , because the convection is driven by composition gradients in an otherwise thermally stable layer , the convective heat flux is inward , potentially heating the layers deep in the ocean .    in this paper ,",
    "we consider the cooling of the outer layers of the star in quiescence , during which the liquid layers freeze into a solid and chemical separation occurs , enriching the ocean further in light elements .",
    "we show that the resulting compositionally driven convection can significantly modify the expected cooling curves of accreting transients .",
    "we first discuss the expected size of the compositionally driven heat flux and show that it is easily comparable to the cooling flux in the ocean ( section  [ sec : theory ] ) .",
    "we then present simulations of ocean cooling including heat transport by convection , showing that the light curve is significantly modified ( section  [ sec : simulation ] ) .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the theoretical uncertainties and implications for observed sources ( section  [ sec : discuss ] ) .",
    "the outermost layers of an accreting neutron star form a gaseous atmosphere and liquid ocean @xcite , in regions where the coulomb coupling parameter @xmath0 @xcite , where @xmath1 is the number average over the mixture of nuclei with charge @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the electron sphere radius , and @xmath4 is the temperature . a useful measure of the depth is the column depth @xmath5 , related to the pressure by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the gravity .",
    "the base of the ocean lies at y_b,14 = 1.8 ( ) ^4 ( ) ^-4()^-1 , [ eq : yb ] where @xmath8 , @xmath9  k , @xmath10 , and the subscript ` @xmath11 ' signifies that the quantities are taken at the base of the ocean .",
    "note that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : yb ] ) we assume @xmath12 , appropriate for an oxygen - enriched ocean ; a heavy - element rich can be much shallower , @xmath13 .",
    "bc09 showed that when accretion ends , the cooling of the star proceeds by the temperature profile relaxing from the outside - in . at",
    "any given time , lower density layers have cooled and adopted a constant flux temperature profile , whereas deeper layers have yet to thermally relax .",
    "the transition occurs at a depth given by setting the thermal timescale = 19  days  y_14()^-1()^2()^-1 [ eq : tthermal ] ( henyey & lecuyer 1969 ; equation  7 of bc09 ) equal to the current time . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tthermal ] ) , @xmath14 is the mass density , @xmath15 is the specific heat , @xmath16 is the thermal conductivity , and @xmath17 is the pressure scale height . in the ocean , the pressure is dominated by the relativistic degenerate electrons with @xmath18 , giving the scalings @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 and @xmath4 constant ( e.g. , mc11 and references therein ) .    equations  ( [ eq : yb ] ) and ( [ eq : tthermal ] ) show that tens of days after the onset of quiescence , the base of the ocean will start to cool and solidify . as new crust is formed , the bottom of the ocean becomes enriched in light elements because of chemical separation @xcite . in mc11 , we estimated the timescales for particle nucleation , growth , and sedimentation of solid particles , finding that these `` microscopic '' timescales were much shorter than `` macroscopic '' timescales such as the time to accrete the ocean , or more relevant here , the time for the ocean to cool .",
    "the picture then is that fluid elements with a light composition are deposited at the base of the ocean and will rise upwards , driving convective mixing .",
    "moreover , the convection occurs in a medium that is otherwise thermally stratified .",
    "therefore the convective heat flux , which is proportional to the excess of the temperature gradient @xmath22 in the star compared to the adiabatic gradient @xmath23 , or @xmath24 , is negative ; the compositionally driven convection transports heat inwards .",
    "we can estimate the expected size of @xmath25 by comparing the heat and composition fluxes . in mixing length theory , the heat flux is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the convective velocity ; whereas the composition flux is @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the composition gradient in the star @xmath30 ( mc11 ) , and @xmath31 is the light element mass fraction .",
    "the convective velocity is given by the superadiabaticity , v_conv^2 g l^2 , where @xmath32 is the mixing length , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "in the ocean , the convection is extremely efficient and therefore close to marginal stability , @xmath35 .",
    "the heat and composition fluxes are then related by f_conv = - c_pt ( ) .",
    "[ eq : fconvfx ]    during cooling , the composition of the ocean is changing with time as the ocean is enriched in light elements . for efficient convection ,",
    "the light element fraction is fairly constant over the ocean ( @xmath36 ) , and so @xmath37 is roughly constant throughout the ocean .",
    "the composition flux is then @xmath38 , and the heat flux is f_conv = -y c_pt .",
    "[ eq : fconvx ] taking @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( mc11 ) , we find a flux that increases steeply inwards , @xmath41 .",
    "if cooling is unaffected by compositionally driven convection , we estimate the timescale on which @xmath31 is changing , @xmath42 , to be a typical thermal time at the ocean floor : in the standard cooling model the bulk of the ocean freezes on a thermal time ; as it does it releases nearly all of its light elements into the remaining ocean and approximately doubles the light element content there .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : fconvx ] ) becomes f_conv-10 ^ 25  erg  cm^-2  s^-1  y_14 ^ 5/4 ( ) ^-1 [ eq : fconv ] where we have assumed @xmath43 and @xmath44 [ and @xmath45 and @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tthermal ] ) ] . the flux from compositionally driven convection in eq .  ( [ eq : fconv ] ) easily outweighs the cooling flux , @xmath47 .",
    "this suggests that the cooling of an ocean with chemical separation included should be significantly different than without , and motivates our numerical calculations that will be presented in the next section .",
    "as we shall see below , the freezing of the ocean is strongly regulated by the convective heat flux , and in turn keeps the heat flux at a much lower level than is suggested by eq .",
    "( [ eq : fconv ] ) .",
    "we solve for the thermal relaxation of the neutron star ocean and crust by solving the thermal diffusion equation following bc09 , but including convective heat fluxes modeled using mixing length theory and assuming the convection is efficient as described in mc11 , and in addition by following the composition profile as chemical separation and mixing occur .",
    "for the examples shown here , we take the ocean composition to be a mixture of oxygen and selenium , for which the phase diagram is shown in the lower panel of figure  1 in mc11 .",

    "the base of the ocean is located at the right - most extent of each curve ; while the top of the convection zone is located at the depth where @xmath31 ( the light element fraction ) reaches the burning layer level of 0.02 ( paper  i ) or , for @xmath54  days , at the top of the ocean . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] shows an example light curve with and without compositionally driven convection included .",
    "figures  [ fig : tcool ] and [ fig : xenrich ] show the temperature and composition profiles , respectively , at different times as the ocean and crust cool .",
    "the temperature profile at the end of the accretion outburst is similar to that assumed by bc09 , with an inward directed heat flux , and ( for figs .",
    "[ fig : tcool ] and [ fig : xenrich ] ) an initial base composition @xmath55 , corresponding to the steady state ( mc11 ) .",
    "the kink in the temperature profile at @xmath56 is due to the jump in composition between the ocean and overlying h / he layer ( cf .",
    "paper i ) .",
    "the neutron star mass and radius are @xmath57 and @xmath58 , giving a redshift factor of @xmath59 .",
    "we find that the evolution proceeds in four stages . during stage  1 ,",
    "the base of the ocean has not yet started to cool and so the evolution is the same with or without convection included .",
    "the light curve is a power - law with slope given by equation  8 of bc09 , with the modification that @xmath60 in the ocean rather than 3/4 as in the outer crust .    in stage 2",
    "( @xmath61 in figs .",
    "[ fig : lightcurve][fig : xenrich ] ) , the cooling wave has reached the bottom of the ocean , and new crust begins to form , driving convection . because convection transports heat inward from the ocean to the ocean - crust boundary , cooling at the boundary is delayed at the expense of more rapid cooling in the ocean . as a result ,",
    "the temperature profile in the ocean becomes very steep and the light curve drops faster than without convection . during this stage ,",
    "the convective heat flux is strong and the boundary cools very slowly ; the transition depth and temperature @xmath62 and @xmath63 remain close to their values at the onset of quiescence . in this way",
    ", the convection acts analogously to the latent heat .",
    "the cusp in the temperature profile is due to the jump in conductive flux that must occur to balance the large inward convective flux in the ocean .",
    "the temperature profile can not steepen indefinitely , because eventually the temperature gradient at the base of the ocean @xmath52 approaches @xmath64 , the liquidus temperature gradient ( i.e. , how the melting temperature varies with pressure ; see mc11 ) .",
    "when @xmath65 , multiple depths at the bottom of the ocean freeze simultaneously .",
    "this rapid freezing quickly suppresses itself , however , as strong compositionally driven convection heats the base of the ocean and melts the top of the crust , mixing a heavy - element fluid into the bottom of the ocean and thereby stabilizing the ocean against further convection .",
    "cooling resumes , but convection remains off , such that the steep temperature profile at the ocean base that had been supported by convection quickly flattens due to heat conduction .",
    "once the heavy - element - enriched fluid at the base of the ocean completely solidifies , compositionally driven convection resumes and the temperature profile steepens again .    in this manner @xmath52 oscillates around @xmath53 .",
    "we refer to this phase as stage  3 ( @xmath66 in figs .",
    "[ fig : lightcurve][fig : xenrich ] ) . in this stage convection is sporadic in the ocean and can no longer prevent the ocean base from cooling . as a result , the ocean boundary moves outward and the cooling wave then continues its inward motion through the crust .",
    "we find generally that @xmath67 ; i.e. , that the ocean - crust boundary cools rapidly but moves outward slowly .",
    "this is due to the compensating effect of light element enrichment on the freezing depth . during stage  3 ,",
    "the surface temperature @xmath49 still drops with time , but at a rate similar to without convection ; and now @xmath65 is constant while @xmath63 and @xmath62 drop and @xmath68 increases .    during stage  4 ( @xmath69 in figs .",
    "[ fig : lightcurve][fig : xenrich ] ) , the crust is thermally relaxed , the ocean cools too slowly for convection to support the steep gradient @xmath65 , and the light curve returns to the shape it would have if there was no ocean convection .",
    "note , however , that due to light element enrichment the asymptotic value of @xmath49 is slightly higher in the case with convection than without ( the ocean thermal conductivity @xmath70 , and so for a given base temperature the outwards flux is greater for a lower @xmath71 ) .",
    "alternatively , the ocean experiences an abrupt transition to stage  4 when the base is saturated with light elements ( @xmath72 ) and chemical separation halts ; this happens at @xmath73  days in the @xmath74 case of fig .",
    "[ fig : lightcurve ] .",
    "previous calculations of the thermal relaxation of accreting neutron stars in quiescence have assumed that the ocean cools passively . in contrast , we have shown here that mixing in the ocean driven by chemical separation at the base leads to a significantly different evolution , changing the expected cooling curve . the early time ( 1100  days )",
    "cooling curve of quiescent neutron stars potentially offers a remarkable new probe of the freezing and chemical separation of a classical plasma in `` real time '' .",
    "the timing of the rapid drop in flux is sensitive to the composition and temperature of the ocean at the end of the outburst .",
    "the magnitude of the effect depends on the composition of the ocean , in particular the fraction of light elements and contrast in the atomic mass of the light and heavy nuclei .     and a core temperature of @xmath75  k , and use an impurity parameter @xmath76 and @xmath55 ( solid and dotted curves ) and @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( dashed curve ) . for igr",

    "detecting the signature of convection will require better sampling of the early phase of the cooling curve .",
    "we can generally fit currently available light curves equally well with and without convection .",
    "these fits will be presented in a companion paper @xcite ; two examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : both ] .",

    "@xcite fit the light curve with a standard cooling model ( neglecting the two data points marked in fig .",
    "[ fig : both ] that are argued to be contaminated with residual accretion ) . including convection we find that we can match the drop in luminosity at @xmath85@xmath86 days .",
    "a general result is that convection lessens , but does not remove , the need for a shallow heat source in the ocean during accretion ( bc09 ; paper i ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , because light element enrichment increases the thermal conductivity and reduces the temperature gradient , making the ocean hotter .",
    "convection could help with recent observations of two classical transients ( with shorter 23  month outbursts ) . in igr",
    "j174802446 @xcite , the flux remains elevated above the value observed before the outburst .",
