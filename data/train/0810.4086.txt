    "it was proved by chatzidakis and pillay @xcite that if @xmath4 is a first order superstable theory , and the theory @xmath5 has a model companion @xmath6 , then @xmath6 is supersimple . throughout this paper",
    "we refer to @xmath6 ( when it exists ) as the theory of models of @xmath4 equipped with a _",
    "generic _ automorphism .",
    "continuous first order logic is an extension of first order logic , introduced in @xcite as a formalism for a model theoretic treatment of metric structures ( see also @xcite for a general exposition of the model theory of metric structures ) .",
    "it is a natural question to ask whether the theorem of chatzidakis and pillay generalises to continuous logic and metric structures .",
    "the proof of chatzidakis and pillay would hold in metric structures if we used the classical definitions of superstability and supersimplicity literally ( namely , types do not fork over finite sets ) .",
    "these definitions , however , are known to be too strong in metric structures , and need to be weakened somewhat in order to make sense .",
    "for example , the theory of hilbert spaces has a countable language , is totally categorical and does not satisfy the classical definition of superstability .",
    "the standard definition for @xmath1-stability and superstability for metric structures ( @xcite , and later @xcite ) comes from measuring the size of a type space not by its cardinality but by its density character in the metric induced on it from the structures .",
    "a continuous theory is supersimple if for every @xmath7 , the @xmath8-neighbourhood of a type does not fork over a finite set of parameters , or equivalently , if ordinal lascar ranks corresponding to `` @xmath8-dividing '' exist .",
    "a theory is superstable if and only if it is stable and supersimple .",
    "similarly , @xmath1-stability is equivalent to the existence of ordinal @xmath8-morley ranks , which may be defined via a metric variant of the classical cantor - bendixson ranks ( see @xcite for a general study of such ranks ) .    with these corrected definitions ,",
    "the class of @xmath1-stable theories is rich with examples : hilbert spaces , probability algebras , @xmath9 banach lattices and so on .",
    "furthermore , many classical results can be generalised .",
    "for example , an @xmath1-stable theory has prime models over every set , an uncountably categorical theory in a countable language is @xmath1-stable , and so on ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a somewhat more involved preservation result was shown by the first author @xcite , namely that the theory of lovely pairs of models of a supersimple ( respectively , superstable ) theory is again supersimple ( respectively , superstable ) .    with superstability and supersimplicity defined as above , the question whether a superstable theory with a generic automorphism is supersimple arises again .",
    "a specific instance of this question was asked by the second author and c.  ward henson @xcite regarding the theory of probability algebras equipped with a generic automorphism .",
    "it was answered negatively by the first author , showing that probability algebras with a generic automorphism are not superstable .",
    "the proof appears in .",
    "however , the notions of @xmath1-stability and/or superstability mentioned above might still be too strong : while they consider types of tuples up to arbitrarily small distance , one may further relax this and consider types also up to arbitrarily small perturbations of the entire language , or parts thereof .",
    "this idea can be formalised with the theory of perturbations as developed in @xcite and somewhat restated in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  4 ) .",
    "we shall assume some familiarity with the second reference .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study carefully two examples : hilbert spaces and probability algebras , both equipped with a generic automorphism .",
    "the theory @xmath10 of atomless probability algebras and the theory @xmath11 of infinite dimensional hilbert spaces have some features in common .",
    "they are @xmath1-stable , separably categorical over any finite set of parameters and types over sets are stationary .",
    "it follows ( see @xcite ) that both @xmath12 and @xmath13 admit model companions @xmath0 and @xmath2 .    in",
    "we deal with the theory @xmath0 of hilbert spaces equipped with a generic automorphism .",
    "we recall some if its properties from @xcite .",
    "we use a corollary of the weyl - von neumann - berg theorem to show that @xmath0 is @xmath1-stable up to perturbation ( of the automorphism ) , and admits prime models up to perturbation over any set . unlike the arguments in @xcite ,",
    "our arguments can be extended to a generic action of a finitely generated group of automorphisms ( i.e. , a generic unitary representation , see @xcite ) and even to hilbert spaces equipped with a generic action of a fixed finitely generated @xmath14-algebra .",
    "this section also serves as a soft analogue for the main results of the other sections .",
    "in we deal with the theory @xmath2 of probability algebras with a generic automorphism , first studied in @xcite .",
    "specifically , we show that @xmath2 is @xmath1-stable up to perturbations of the automorphism .",
    "it is an open question if @xmath2 admits prime models up to perturbations .    in",
    "we conclude with the first author s proof that without perturbation the theory @xmath2 is not superstable , showing that the results of are in some sense optimal .",
