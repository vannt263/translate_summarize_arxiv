    "as is widely known , current observational evidence heavily favors an accelerating and spatially flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker universe ( for a pedagogical short update see @xcite ) .",
    "since normal matter fulfils the strong energy condition and can not drive cosmic acceleration , recourse is often made either to a small cosmological constant ( @xmath4cdm model ) or to an almost evenly distributed source of energy called  dark energy \" or  quintessence \" with equation of state @xmath5 where @xmath6 , such that it makes the pressure negative enough to render the deceleration parameter negative ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    ", the zero subindex means present time .",
    "certain kind of models invoke that both components ( dark matter and dark energy ) may not be separately conserved due to some ( unknown ) coupling between each other .",
    "this proposal has been explored @xcite , @xcite and looks promising as a suitable mutual interaction can make both components redshift coherently . however , because of problems of their own ( as the inability to recover the dust era when going back in time ) neither of these proposals , as they stand , can be regarded as the final answer .    as suggested by dalal _",
    "_ it seems rather more advisable to use the scanty observational information we possess to constrain the quintessence field from a minimum of theoretical input than trying to get a detailed fit to these data from any specific potential @xcite .",
    "these authors introduced a generalized class of dark energy models characterized by a non - canonical scaling of the ratio of the densities of dark matter and dark energy with the scale factor of the robertson - walker metric .",
    "they suggest a phenomenological form + @xmath9 + for the ratio of the dark matter density @xmath10 to the density @xmath11 of the dark energy , where the scaling parameter @xmath12 is regarded as a new variable . for an equation of state @xmath13 of the dark energy component a value",

    "if the cosmological dynamics admits a stable , stationary solution @xmath16 , corresponding to @xmath15 and the present universe is already close to this state , there will be no coincidence problem .",
    "consequently , according to @xcite , the deviation of the parameter @xmath12 from @xmath15 quantifies the severity of the problem .",
    "but it is not only the stationary solution which deserves interest .",
    "any solution which deviates from @xmath17 represents a testable , non - standard cosmological model and any solution with a scaling parameter @xmath18 will make the coincidence problem less severe .",
    "it is therefore desirable to have a physical mechanism that could give rise to such kind of deviations from the standard dynamics .",

    "@xmath119 the dynamics can be analytically integrated .",
    "since the luminosity distance in this model differs from that of the @xmath4cdm model only in third order in the redshift parameter @xmath65 , it fits the present observations as well as the @xmath4cdm model does .",
    "further , the einstein - de sitter expansion law for a dust universe is recovered for large redshifts . on the other hand , the coincidence problem ,",
    "although not solved , is less severe than for the @xmath4cdm universe , which can be traced back to a continuous transfer of energy from the @xmath24 component to the cdm fluid .",
    "wile the available observational data are insufficient to discriminate between the models , it is to be expected that the snap satellite will provide us with a wealth of high redshift supernovae data able to do the job .",
