    "optical spectroscopy and photometry provide good evidence that black holes with masses of @xmath3 reside at the centers of giant elliptical galaxies ( e.g. kormendy & richstone 1995 ) .",
    "x - ray observations of these galaxies allow an inference of the interstellar gas temperature and thus an estimate of the bondi accretion radius , where the dynamics of the gas start to be dominated by the potential of the black hole .",
    "the density of the gas is also derived from these observations , so the bondi accretion rate can be estimated .",
    "the high resolution of the chandra x - ray observatory has proved to be particularly useful for such studies .",
    "the bolometric luminosities of the black hole engines can be estimated from multi - wavelength observations , particularly in the infrared .",
    "these luminosities are typically several orders of magnitude fainter than predicted by models of thin disc accretion at the bondi rate in which about 10% of the rest mass energy is radiated ( e.g. fabian & rees 1995 ) .",

    "two temperature collisionless accretion models have been invoked ( e.g. , ichimaru 1977 ; narayan & yi 1995 ; quataert & gruzinov 1999 ; narayan 2002 ) .",
    "these models typically assume that the energy exchange between electrons and ions proceeds by coulomb collisions .",
    "the associated accretion flows do not radiate efficiently if ( 1 ) the dissipation primarily heats the protons and ( 2 ) if the electron - ion equilibration time is is longer than the radial infall time .",
    "the gravitational energy is then carried by ions to the event horizon of the black hole , in what are known as advection - dominated accretion flows ( adafs ) .    for the ellipticals ,",
    "minimalistic standard adaf models predict too high a luminosity ( e.g. di matteo et al . 2000 ) .",
    "variations of adafs are however still in the running : adafs can be combined or replaced with a models involving a radially dependent accretion rate and winds ( blandford & begelman 1999 ; quataert & narayan 2000 ) .",
    "alternatively , adafs unstable to convection ( called convection dominated accretion flows  cdafs ; narayan , igumenshchev , & abramowicz 2000 ; quataert & gruzinov 2000 ) have the outward transport of angular momentum inhibited by the convection and thus their accretion rate onto the central engine reduced .",
    "there are however some unresolved issues with the physics of these models .",
    "regarding cdafs , the parameter space allowed for solutions that reduce the outward transport of angular momentum becomes restricted when magnetic fields are present and seems to require that the field saturates at a very low value .",
    "otherwise the magneto - rotational instability dominates the outward angular momentum transport ( balbus & hawley 2002 ; narayan et al .",
    "it should also be noted that virtually all flavors of optically thin adafs and cdafs require maintenance of two - temperature collisionless flows .",
    "the unanswered plasma physics questions about the viability of this situation have also been an important area of ongoing research ( begelman & chiueh 1988 ; bitsnovatyi - kogan & lovelace 1997 , quataert 1998 , gruzinov 1998 , blackman 1999 ; quataert & gruzinov 2000 ; blackman 2000 ; pariev & blackman 2003 ) .    for these reasons",
    "it is still of interest to consider other contributors to the quiescence of elliptical galaxy centers .",
    "here we propose a very simple alternative ( or companion process ) to these accretion models .",
    "we consider the possibility that most of the accreting gas forms stars , shutting off the supply of fuel to the engine . in ",
    "2 we make a careful estimate of the bondi accretion rate in elliptical galaxies . in ",
    "3 we then describe the expected properties of the disc that forms inside the bondi radius , concluding that it is gravitationally unstable and should form stars . in  4 we consider general properties of star - forming `` accretion '' discs around black holes , describing the signatures and feedback from star formation , its efficiency , and the amount of gas present in the disc in steady state .",
    "we discuss the application of this model to m87 , other ellipticals , the galactic center , quasars and agn in  5 , and conclude in  6 .",
    "x - ray observations show that elliptical galaxies contain hot gas approximately at the virial temperature ( e.g. mathews & brighenti 2003 ) . where high resolution data are available , there is often evidence for a temperature gradient such that the central temperature is cooler than the outer regions ( e.g. m87  di matteo et al .",

    "however the data shown by di matteo et al .",
    "( 2003 ) show a temperature gradient so that the inner regions are cooler .",
    "if this trend continues all the way to the bondi radius then the cooling rate would balance heating , even keeping the same value of the density .",
    "thus the existing data are not able to clearly distinguish whether conditions are closer to isothermal or adiabatic , and we must consider a range of possible values of @xmath30 . for the m87 system , the expected accretion rate is @xmath44 and the accretion luminosity is @xmath45 .    the observed spectrum ( @xmath46 ) from the nucleus of m87 peaks somewhere in the vicinity of @xmath47 ( e.g. di matteo et al . 2003 ) , but with large uncertainties .",

    "thus although the total luminosity is quite uncertain , both because of the limited spectral coverage for the radiated part , and the difficulty of estimating the kinetic part , it appears that the nucleus is underluminous by about an order of magnitude with respect to models of bondi accretion with @xmath57 .",
    "note that it is also possible that the nuclear activity is varying on timescales shorter than the dynamical timescale at the bondi radius , @xmath58 , which is @xmath59 for m87 .",

    "we propose a new mechanism that helps explain why the central black holes of massive ellipticals are underluminous : they are underfed compared to their bondi rates because much of the accretion flow condenses into stars .",
    "our mechanism is complementary to ( not contradictory to ) any additional low luminosity accretion mode or outflow mechanism that is operating in the immediate vicininty of the black hole .",
    "the accreting material is likely to have an overall net angular momentum with respect to the central black hole . while the inflow is subsonic it is relatively easy for turbulent motions , which themselves are limited to about the sound speed , to transport angular momentum outwards",
    "this has been observed in the numerical simulations of abel , bryan & norman ( 2002 ) in the context of primordial star formation from gas that is only able to cool quite slowly . following the approach of tan & mckee ( 2004 ) we assume that angular momentum is conserved inside the sonic point @xmath60 for @xmath61 , and that the material passing through this point has a mean circular velocity @xmath62 .",

    "note that use of the relation @xmath67 does not account for possible pressure support from radiation pressure from a young , massive stellar population in the disc that could couple to the gas via dust .",
    "the magnetorotational instability can yield values of @xmath74 ( balbus & hawley 1998 ) , while local self - gravity can give @xmath75 ( gammie 2001 ) . if these processes are relatively inefficient then for a given accretion rate the disc surface density builds up to such a high level that the disc becomes gravitationally unstable and fragments into bound structures that eventually lead to the formation of stars .",

    "the stars have less and less influence on the gravitational stability of the gas .",
    "furthermore , for continued star formation , the gas itself must be self - gravitating , not just the star - gas system .",
    "this effect can be seen in the star - forming discs of typical disc galaxies : the threshold for star formation is still adequately described by the toomre parameter , @xmath89 , that depends on the total surface density of gas ( martin & kennicutt 2001 ) .",
    "the presence of the more massive stellar disc raises the particular value of @xmath89 below which star formation occurs , but only by factors of a few or less ( jog & solomon 1984 ) .",
    "one way that this can occur is via the local concentration of gas in stellar spiral arms ( e.g. kuno et al .",

    "as @xmath93 is reduced via star formation , the gas disc becomes more and more stable with respect to its self - gravity .",

    "is still large , even if the optical depth to thermal radiation at @xmath83 is @xmath95 .",
    "the amount of heating per mass of new stars depends on their initial mass function ( imf ) . the upper part of the imf appears to approximately follow a salpeter ( 1955 ) distribution , @xmath96 , for @xmath97 with a dearth of stars beyond the upper mass limit .",
    "the imfs in the galaxy ( salpeter 1955 ; kroupa 2002 ) and in metal - rich starbursts ( schaerer et al .",
    "2000 ) appear to be similar in this regime .",
    "below a solar mass the galactic imf flattens somewhat ( e.g. muench et al . 2002 ) , but much of the total mass is still contained in sub - solar - mass stars .",
    "there are no observational constraints on this part of the imf in starburst galaxies .    for the above imf , while most of the mass is in low - mass stars , most of the energy injection into the ism comes from high - mass stars .",
    "however the value of the high - mass cutoff in the imf does not significantly affect the overall feedback properties of the population , so long as it is greater than @xmath98 or so .",
    "the uncertainty in the low - mass end introduces an overall uncertainty in the normalization of feedback per unit stellar mass of factors of a few : for example if the salpeter imf extends down to @xmath99 then the feedback per stellar mass is reduced by a factor of 0.39 from the case with a lower - mass cutoff of @xmath100 .",
    "goodman & tan ( 2004 ) have argued that gravitational instability in the inner regions of quasar accretion discs ( at radii of a fraction of a parsec ) may lead to very massive stars .",
    "conditions there are very different from those at a typical value of @xmath78 of the bondi - fed discs considered in the present paper",
    ". in particular , the inner quasar discs are closer to being dominated by radiation pressure as opposed to gas pressure ; temperatures are too high to allow the presence of dust grains ; and these regions are only marginally self - gravitating ( by definition ) .",

    "this estimate ignores dust absorption in the disc , which would lower the numerical factor in the above equation .",
    "note that a recombination flow of one solar mass per year would produce an h@xmath2 luminosity that is a factor of @xmath112 times smaller than the amount produced by one solar mass per year of star formation ( with the above salpeter imf ) .",
    "the h@xmath2 flux from the circumnuclear disc of m87 is @xmath113 ( ford et al .",

    "this implies a star formation rate of @xmath115 using the normalization of equation  ( [ sfr ] ) .",
    "note that this estimate is a lower limit because it does not allow for any internal extinction in the star - forming disc that would attenuate the observed h@xmath2 flux .",

    "figure 3 , described in more detail in the next section , shows how the bolometric luminosity due to star formation compares to the observed spectrum of the m87 nucleus .    despite the uncertainties in the imf , internal extinction and equation of state of the accreting gas ,",
    "the key result from the above star formation rate estimates is that they are both roughly consistent with the inferred bondi accretion rate .",

    "one prediction of our model of ( bondi - fed ) star - forming accretion flows is the presence of cold , presumably molecular gas . to estimate the amount , we assume that a steady state has been achieved so that the star formation rate in the disc balances the bondi accretion rate to the disc .",

    "we have presented a model of star - forming accretion flows with particular attention to the flow inside the bondi radius of the central black hole of an elliptical galaxy .",
    "our approach was as follows : first we calculated the accretion rate , showing the explicit dependence on the effective equation of state of the gas .",
    "we then estimated the heating and cooling rates of the gas in the accretion flow near the bondi radius , showing that idealized accretion solutions @xmath147 are probably quite a reasonable description of the actual accretion flow , at least in the case of m87 .",
    "we then argued that angular momentum conservation inside the sonic point of the flow leads to formation of a disc on scales that are a factor of a few or so smaller than the bondi radius .",
    "the disc was shown to be gravitationally unstable if the heating is due to viscous processes in the disc .",
    "we found that self - gravity is so strong that most of the mass flux will be converted into stars .",
    "the energy input from these star can stabilize only a small residual fraction of the initial mass flux : i.e. the accretion rate to the black hole is substantially reduced below the bondi accretion rate .",
    "we argue that this is a major cause of the `` low luminosity '' of black holes observed in giant elliptical galaxies , where `` low luminosity '' is in reference to a model of thin disc accretion at the bondi rate as determined from the conditions in the kpc - scale , x - ray - emitting gas .",
    "a radiatively - inefficient accretion flow may exist at the center of the disc , much closer to the black hole .",
    "however , its inefficiency must be argued in the context of an accretion rate and a luminosity determined at a much smaller scale , for example where the disc is no longer self - gravitating .",
    "the predictions of this model include the presence of a star - forming gas disc ( i.e. containing relatively cold molecular gas ) around the black holes of ellipticals and the presence of hot , young stars in these regions .",
    "these may reveal themselves by spectral features ( e.g. clustered h@xmath2 emission from gas ionized by massive stars ; stellar atmosphere / wind features , e.g. from wolf - rayet stars ; or stellar ultraviolet continuum , although this may be swamped by agn emission ) or by the occurrence of type ii supernovae .",
    "for example a typical star formation rate at the center of a giant elliptical galaxy is expected to be @xmath148 , about a factor of 30 less than the star formation rate of a milky - way - like disc galaxy . for the standard salpeter imf adopted here ,",
    "the type ii supernova rate from such an elliptical galaxy is @xmath149 .",
    "nayakshin ( 2004 ) considered how the presence of many young stars , left over from a previous quasar phase , can affect the accretion and appearance of low - luminosity agn .",
    "however , he did not consider the possibility that the stars are currently forming in these systems .",
    "we now summarize the potential application of the star - forming accretion disc model to m87 , other giant ellipticals , the galactic center , quasars and other agn .",
    "we have used m87 as an example to illustrate the model throughout the text . here",
    "we summarize this application , discuss the existing evidence that supports the model , and suggest future observations that can confirm or refute its validity .    the central black hole of m87 , with mass @xmath150 ( macchetto et al .",
    "1997 ) , should have a bondi accretion rate of @xmath151 ( this range corresponds to uncertainties in @xmath152 ) from the hot ( 0.8  kev ) , low - density ( @xmath153 ) gas ( di matteo et al .",
    "2003 ) at the center of the giant elliptical ( uncertainties in the black hole mass and gas temperature could also change the accretion rate by factors of three or so ) .",
    "the bondi radius is about @xmath154  pc , but could be twice as large if the high end of the black hole mass determination is valid and the temperature in this inner region is actually 0.5  kev ( see discussion in  2 ) .",
    "the expected _ median _ disc radius is several times smaller than the bondi radius : our fiducial case has it smaller by factors of 36 and 4 for @xmath43 . the actual outer disc radius would be larger than the median by factors of a few , and in any case the exact size depends on the details of the initial angular momentum distribution of the hot accreting gas , which is not well constrained . since the h@xmath2 disc seen by hst is @xmath155pc in extent ( ford et al .",
    "1994 ; see fig .",
    "2 ) , this is probably the best estimate of the disc scale in this system .",
    "note also that the hst observations show some filamentary structure out to several hundred pc , so that the accretion process may not be quite a simple as given by the purely bondi solution .    despite the caveats ,",
    "the coincidence of the observed disc size with the estimated bondi radius supports a model in which that disc is forming from a bondi accretion flow with initial circular motions of order the hot gas sound speed .",
    "the h@xmath156 disc was described by ford et al .",
    "( 1994 ) as having `` spiral structure '' and `` dust lanes '' ( see fig .  2 ) , which supports the theoretical conclusion that it is gravitationally unstable (  3 ) and contains cool gas that is liable to undergo star formation (   3,4 ) . the total h@xmath2 luminosity implies a star formation rate ( assuming a standard salpeter imf ) within factors of a few of the bondi accretion rate at which the disc is being fed .",
    "this is consistent with the implied star formation rate being equal to the bondi accretion rate given the uncertainties .",
    "we can model the bolometric luminosity associated with this star formation rate .",
    "figure  3 shows the observed infrared and radio spectrum of the m87 nucleus , much of which results from nonthermal emission from the agn ( see  2 ) .",
    "care must be taken since the fluxes at different wavelengths often correspond to regions of different scales .",
    "also shown in figure  3 is a simple black body spectrum of the gas and dust disc heated by star formation at rates @xmath151 , corresponding to luminosities @xmath157 .",
    "the temperature is set by assuming this luminosity is emitted over the two faces of a disc of radius 100  pc .",
    "this model is highly idealized , since it assumes a single temperature , ignores additional heating from the interstellar radiation field of the galaxy , ignores deviations from a pure black body spectrum , such as pah emission features in the range @xmath158 , and assumes all the light from stars is reprocessed by dust .",
    "the overall luminosity normalization is also imf - dependent .",
    "nevertheless it is interesting that these simple models are now in a position to be tested by high resolution infrared and sub - mm observations that are now feasible with the spitzer space telescope and the sub - millimeter array ( sma ) .",
    "[ fig : spec ]    the presence of cold , presumably molecular gas in the disc with total mass @xmath159 could be searched for with mm interferometers .",
    "such a search is particularly well suited to the capabilities of the sma and alma .    to estimate the efficiency of the central engine we need to know the black hole s accretion rate . as noted in  2 , to explain the observations",
    "requires a reduction in the accretion rate by a factor of @xmath160 from the bondi value ( this factor is itself uncertain by about an order of magnitude ) , or a similar reduction in the efficiency of energy liberation from the fiducial value of @xmath57 .",
    "note that most of the energy is thought to be released as non - radiating kinetic energy of the jet / outflow .",
    "the reduction in black hole accretion rate from the bondi rate due to star formation is also quite uncertain .",
    "we estimated ( eq . [ mdotdiscthin ] ) a possible reduction by factors of up to @xmath161 .",

    "the observations of the m87 nucleus can be explained by models of efficient ( @xmath162 ) accretion if a large fraction ( @xmath163 ) of the initial mass flux to the disc forms stars .",
    "while such a high fraction is certainly allowed by the simple estimates of self - regulated star formation we have presented in  4 , quantitative estimates of the residual accretion rate are difficult .      optical imaging with hst has been used to detect dusty discs in elliptical galaxies .",

    "knapp & rupen ( 1996 ) surveyed 42 elliptical galaxies for co emission , concluding that the detection rate was just under 50% .",
    "however , since the half - power beam of these observations was about 30 , these detections most likely do not relate to molecular gas forming inside the bondi radius , but to material formed from evolved stars or associated with the infall of gas - rich satellite galaxies .",

    "the black hole at the galactic center has a mass of @xmath178 , appears to be embedded in hot gas ( as seen in x - rays ) , yet is underluminous by several orders of magnitude with respect to thin disc accretion at the bondi rate ( baganoff et al .",
    "2003 , and references therein ) .",
    "some , but probably not the majority , of the diffuse x - ray emission on the arcsecond scales relevant to bondi accretion may be the dust - scattered halo of the x - ray emission from inside the black hole s bondi radius ( tan & draine 2004 ) .",
    "basic adaf models have been ruled out for the galactic center due to polarization measurements which indicate the density is even lower than that predicted by adafs ( bower et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "this system is probably more complicated than the supermassive black holes in elliptical galaxies because the bondi radius is only @xmath179  pc in size , which is relatively small compared to the feedback scales associated with stellar wind bubbles and supernova remnants from individual massive stars . for example , the dominant source of mass in the region is likely to be from stellar winds from young , massive stars .",
    "some of these are even present inside the bondi radius ( as estimated for the diffuse x - ray emitting gas ) and because of the relatively low mass of the black hole , these winds with speeds @xmath1701000  km / s may be unbound and act to prevent diffuse gas from accreting ( quataert 2004 ) .",
    "a further complication is that there are large amounts of neutral gas in the vicinity ( herrnstein & ho 2004 ; christopher et al .",
    "the sporadic infall of this material may well dominate the time - averaged mass accretion rate .",
    "the issue of self - gravity and quasar accretion discs has been discussed by schlosman & begelman ( 1989 ) , goodman ( 2003 ) and thompson et al .",
    "our model herein has been developed with low - luminosity galactic nuclei in mind , for which the central regions are being fed at the bondi rate from their host elliptical galaxies .",
    "the accretion rates to the black holes powering quasars approach the eddington limited value : @xmath180 , where @xmath181 is the electron scattering opacity , @xmath182 is the ratio of the luminosity to the eddington value , and @xmath183 is the radiative efficiency of the accretion disc .",
    "to have these accretion rates be the residual mass flux from a star - formation supported disc on 100  pc scales requires star formation rates that are @xmath184 times larger ( eq .  [ mdotdiscthin ] ) , which are unrealistic . however , this estimate assumes the star formation time is short compared to the radial advection time in the disc .",
    "thompson et al .",
    "( 2005 ) show that the opposite may be true in quasars , in which case the initial outer - disc mass feeding rate ( or equivalently the star formation rate ) need only be factors of @xmath170100 greater",
    ".    there may be additional complications , such as the supply of some very low angular momentum material to the inner disc , which is not gravitationally unstable .",
    "the problem of the mass supply to quasars requires further work .",
    "the possibility remains that self - gravity in a disc is so severe that black holes need to be supplied at much smaller radii , perhaps through stellar disruption events ( e.g. hills 1975 ; goodman 2003 ) .    in lower luminosity agn , such as seyferts and liners ,",
    "there is much evidence for nuclear star formation ( e.g. terlevich & melnick 1985 ) .",
    "these accretion discs are also expected to be self - gravitating , and there is some observational evidence to support this ( e.g. kondratko , greenhill , & moran 2005 ) .",
    "while the fueling of these nuclei may have little to do with bondi accretion ( because of the presence of large amounts of cold gas in an extended disc ) , the model of an accretion disc supported by stellar feedback (  4 ) probably is relevant , predicting a general correlation of star formation and agn activity .",
    "observations of the central regions of elliptical galaxies suggest that supermassive black holes that reside there are fed at the bondi rate , of a few hundredths to a few tenths of a solar mass per year . for standard thin disc accretion ,",
    "these black holes are very underluminous given this mass accretion rate .",
    "previously , alternative accretion models invoking inefficient radiation of gravitational energy , radially - dependent accretion rates , and outflows have been proposed as solutions to this problem . in this paper",
    "we have suggested an additional process , likely occurring , which can be of comparable or potentially greater importance : bondi - fed star - forming discs .",
    "accretion occurs at the bondi rate , but because the disc that inevitably forms inside the bondi radius is very gravitationally unstable , most of the mass flux reaching it turns into stars .",
    "stellar feedback is relatively weak so that only a small residual amount of gas can be stabilized to reach the black hole at the center of the disc .",
    "our estimates of this residual mass flux are uncertain , but appear to be potentially small enough that standard thin disc accretion models can avoid the constraints imposed by the observed low luminosities .",
    "adafs , cdafs , or other models with outflows may still apply in the very inner regions , but with a smaller outer boundary value for their inward mass flux .",
    "our model is highly simplified : we mostly consider only a single typical scale for the disc radius , whereas in reality gas will reach the disc at a range of radii depending on the initial angular momentum distribution ; our quantitative estimates depend on the assumed stellar imf ; we have adopted the standard alpha approximation for viscous stresses in the disc ; and we have mostly considered only thermal pressure support in the disc , ignoring magnetic pressure .    as a result of these simplifications , it is vital to compare the model as closely as possible to real systems , the best observed being m87 .",
    "we have described how the observational data on the nucleus of this galaxy are consistent with the possibility that more than half of the bondi accretion flow is depleted into stars : a thin disc of gas and dust , apparently self - gravitating , is seen inside the bondi radius and the inferred star formation rate from the h@xmath2 emission is consistent with the bondi accretion rate .",
    "this conclusion is not contradicted even when current estimates of the mechanical luminosity of the m87 jet are incorporated into the residual central engine accretion rates .",
    "additional observations to detect molecular gas scales inside the bondi radius are now feasible with the sma .",
    "this instrument is also capable of detecting continuum emission from dust heated by the expected star formation .",

    "<S> the luminosities of the centers of nearby elliptical galaxies are very low compared to models of thin disc accretion to their black holes at the bondi rate , typically a few hundredths to a few tenths of a solar mass per year . </S>",
    "<S> this has motivated models of inefficiently - radiated accretion that invoke weak electron - ion thermal coupling , and/or inhibited accretion rates due to convection or outflows . here </S>",
    "<S> we point out that even if such processes are operating , a significant fraction of the accreting gas is prevented from reaching the central black hole because it condenses into stars in a gravitationally unstable disc . </S>",
    "<S> star formation occurs inside the bondi radius ( typically @xmath0  pc in giant ellipticals ) , but still relatively far from the black hole in terms of schwarzschild radii . </S>",
    "<S> star formation depletes and heats the gas disc , eventually leading to a marginally stable , but much reduced , accretion flow to the black hole . </S>",
    "<S> we predict the presence of cold ( @xmath1 ) , dusty gas discs , containing clustered h@xmath2 emission and occasional type ii supernovae , both resulting from the presence of massive stars . star formation accounts for several features of the m87 system : a thin disc , traced by h@xmath2 emission , is observed on scales of about 100  pc , with features reminiscent of spiral arms and dust lanes ; the star formation rate inferred from the intensity of h@xmath2 emission is consistent with the bondi accretion rate of the system . </S>",
    "<S> star formation may therefore help suppress accretion onto the central engines of massive ellipticals . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss some implications for the fueling of the galactic center and quasars .    </S>",
