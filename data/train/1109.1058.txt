    "in a high energy proton - proton collision environment such as the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , the majority of the collisions are quite soft , without hard parton scatterings . in an event",
    "that does have parton scatterings with high-@xmath0 transfer , the outgoing partons have to go through the parton showering and hadronization process .",
    "in addition , there will also be the accompanying underlying events ( ue ) , which are mainly from multiple parton interactions ( mpi ) and beam - beam remnants .",
    "all those qcd processes are soft , which means no perturbative predictions are available",
    ". the experiments usually have to rely on the monte carlo ( mc ) descriptions to model them phenomenologically .",
    "the models prior to lhc data were tuned on previous measurements . when extrapolated to lhc energy ,",
    "different models diverge at the predictions .",
    "early lhc data collected by the compact muon solenoid ( cms ) experiment @xcite thus provide a unique chance to deepen our knowledge on the soft qcd through the well designed measurements .",
    "they are crucial for precision measurements of the standard model processes and for new physics searches .",
    "in addition , these measurements on the pp collisions will provide necessary references for physics studies with heavy ion collisions at cms .",
    "in cms , the minimum bias ( mb ) events are mainly triggered by the designed triggers through coincidence of signals from monitoring components of beam pickup timing for experiments ( bptx ) and beam scintillator counters ( bsc ) .",
    "further selections from information recorded in other detectors are applied offline to select the events . in order to extend the transverse momentum",
    "reach , some single jet triggers based on signals from calorimeters are also used in the analysis .",
    "the transverse momentum spectra of charged particles in mb events as measured in cms @xcite are shown in the fig .",

    "the left plot shows the yield with respect to the jet transverse momenta from different data sets with different triggers , which are fully efficient above the trigger thresholds as shown in the bottom panel .",
    "the middle plot compares the phase - space invariant event yield from the data to various mc models .",
    "none of them can describe the spectra perfectly , but pythia8 is more compatible than pythia6 models .",
    "the right plot confirms the scaling behavior with the variable @xmath1 from measurements performed by different experiments at different energies .",
    "[ fig : mbptspectra ]         charged particle multiplicities in mb events as measured by cms @xcite at three lhc energies ( 0.9 tev , 2.36 tev and 7 tev ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mbmultiplicity ] , with different shifts in the scales for visibility .",
    "a large tail in multiplicities is observed in 7 tev , which can reach nearly 200 tracks .",
    "most mc models can not describe the multiplicities well in all energies for these unprecedented measurements , especially in the large multiplicity end .",
    "further tunings are thus required , but pythia8 shows better agreements with data .",
    "strange particle productions are also studies from mb events , at both at 0.9 and 7 tev , and compared @xcite . in the mb data sets , strange meson  and hyperons  ,  can be reconstructed from their decay products well with very good mass resolutions and low background contaminations .",
    "the masses and widths are all consistent with pdg values .",
    "the differential event yields are studied with respect to both strange particle transverse momentum and pseudorapidity ( denoted as @xmath2 ) . for the @xmath3 spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : strangeyieldvspt ] , the empirical fits can describe the data well at both energies .",
    "with increase of the lhc energy , the strange particle @xmath3 spectra all become harder . at 7 tev ,",
    "all the @xmath3 spectra are flatter at the middle where exponential falling dominates . for  spectrum ( left )",
    ", it is also flatter at the higher end where the negative power law dominates .",
    "this is not as obvious as in the case of  ( middle ) and  ( right ) .",
    "the @xmath2 distributios of strange particles are compared to different mc models and tunes for both lhc energies , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : strangeyieldvseta ] . from 0.9 tev to 7 tev , the strange particle yields are doubled , with respect to total non single diffractive ( nsd ) events .",
    "all mc models show big amount of underestimation and need further tuning to be used for future studies of possible strange particle suppression .",
    "two - particle correlation in @xmath4 and @xmath5 reflects the underlying production mechanism .",
    "while the cms measurements of this correlation in the inclusive minbias events at 0.9 and 7 tev @xcite have shown all known features as predicted by mc models , the exclusive measurements with the events selected from the specially designed high multiplicity triggers have shown some unexpected features as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : twoparticlecorrelation ] .    the near side , long range , angular correlation is established at high multiplicities .",
    "it is especially pronounced for the intermediate transverse momenta range @xmath6 .",
    "this feature could not be reproduced from mc simulations .",
    "together with some heavy ion observations , it may indicate the formation of new state of matter in @xmath7 collisions at this energy , so it provides a new test ground for high density qcd physics .",

    "the measurements of bec can provide important information for the size , shape , space - time development of the emitting source .",
    "cms makes bec measurements at 0.9 and 7 tev and studies the dependences of this enhancement on kinematic and topological features of the events @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the enhancement is quantified with respect to reference samples with non interfering boson pairs .",
    "its dependence on the lorentz - invariant variable @xmath8 is usually parameterized with several physical parameters such as the correlation length , long distance correlations , effective size of the emission region , etc .     as a function of the charged - particle multiplicity in the event.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "[ fig : becsizevsn ] clearly establishes the effective emission size @xmath9 as a function of the charged - particle multiplicity in the event .",
    "it confirms for the first time the growth of bec effective emission region with multiplicity which was ambiguously inferred from previous measurements .",
    "this dependence can also account for the growth with @xmath10 very well .",
    "the underlying event ( ue ) includes hadronic activity that is additional to those from hard scattering processes .",
    "it arises mainly from multiple parton scattering ( mpi ) and beam - beam remnants etc .",
    "it is most sensitive in the transverse region , @xmath11 , as a function of the @xmath3 of the leading track - jet .",
    "cms has performed the fully corrected measurements of charged particles from ue of 0.9 tev and 7 tev @xcite @xcite .",

    "the inner band corresponds to the systematic uncertainties and the outer band corresponds to the total experimental uncertainties . here",
    ", statistical and systematic uncertainties are added in quadrature .",
    "pythia z1 tune turns out to describe most of these ue distributions and the @xmath10 dependences quite well .",
    "tune z2 and pythia8 default tune 4c with new mpi model built in also do rather decent jobs .",
    "however , from the mc / data comparisons above , there are still cases and regions that none of them describe well enough .",
    "these cms measurements could thus provide important input for future tunes .",
    "measuring and understanding soft qcd processes at lhc are important for precision standard model measurements and new physics searches .",

    "two - particle angular correlation over a broad range of pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle in pp collisions was measured and a pronounced structure was observed in the two - dimensional correlation function for particle pairs with intermediate transverse momentum of 1 - 3 @xmath16 in high multiplicity events . bose - einstein correlation between identical particles was measured with respect to reference samples without correlation .",
