    "many aspects of the physics and shapes of pne can successfully be explained in terms of the two - wind model by kwok , purton , & fitzgerald ( 1978 ) as the product of the mass - loss history of the star on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and during the central star evolution.our observations indicate that at some point in the evolution of pne other factors may become very important for the further development , and for such objects the two - wind paradigm may break down .",
    "old pne interacting with the ism are a case in point .",
    "this work has implications for a hitherto neglected aspect of pne : they give evidence for an important process that remains very difficult to study ; the return of processed nuclear matter to the ism .",
    "this material leads to the chemical evolution of galaxies .",
    "old pne in decay are the very last objects that can be observed before the nebular material is fully dispersed and mixes with the ism . +",
    "actually this is one of the very few methods to study the properties of the ism directly , in this sense pne can act as a probe performing an active experiment on the ism .",

    "( 2000).it has been shown recently by soker & dgani ( 1997 ) and dgani & soker ( 1998 ) that the effect of the interstellar medium s magnetic field ( ismf ) can be extremely important .",
    "we see evidence for the ismf s action in some of our objects in the form of stripes or rolls as described by dgani ( 2000 ) in this volume .",
