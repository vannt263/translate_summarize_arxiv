    "<S> we provide integrated cross sections for quasielastic charged - current neutrino - nucleus scattering . </S>",
    "<S> results evaluated using the phenomenological scaling function extracted from the analysis of experimental @xmath0 data are compared with those obtained within the framework of the relativistic impulse approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we show that very reasonable agreement is reached when a description of final - state interactions based on the relativistic mean field is included . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with previous studies of differential cross sections which are in accord with the universality property of the superscaling function .    </S>",
    "<S> the development of present and future experimental studies of neutrino oscillations at intermediate to high energies benefits from high - quality predictions for neutrino - nucleus cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematics involved in these processes typically lie in a domain where a fully relativistic formalism is required ; not only should the reaction mechanism incorporate relativity , but also the nuclear dynamics must be described in a relativistic framework . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , any reliable model of neutrino - nucleus scattering first needs to be tested against electron scattering for similar kinematics . </S>",
    "<S> fully relativistic results for the latter have been presented in the past  @xcite using the impulse approximation , namely , where only one nucleon in the nucleus interacts with the virtual photon exchanged in the process . </S>",
    "<S> such analyses have been shown to provide accurate descriptions of quasielastic ( qe ) _ exclusive _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 processes when a proper description of the final - state interactions ( fsi ) between the ejected nucleon and the residual nucleus is incorporated . </S>",
    "<S> this is accomplished by using complex relativistic optical potentials which have been fitted to elastic nucleon - nucleus scattering data  @xcite . for _ </S>",
    "<S> inclusive _ processes of the type @xmath0 and @xmath2 , the contribution of all channels must be retained ; hence the use of complex potentials should be avoided because of the loss of flux implied by the imaginary term . </S>",
    "<S> different approaches have been considered in the literature , e.g. , the use of purely real potentials within the impulse approximation  @xcite and analyses based on the green function method  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although both treatments lead to similar results , a comparison with experimental qe cross sections is not yet conclusive because of the effects introduced by ingredients beyond the impulse approximation such as long- and short - range correlations , meson - exchange currents ( mec ) and , at high energies , the excitation of the @xmath3 resonance .    </S>",
    "<S> these difficulties can be partially overcome by making use of the scaling behavior of the electron - nucleus cross sections through a superscaling analysis ( susa ) in the region of both the qe and @xmath3 peaks . </S>",
    "<S> previous investigations of inclusive @xmath0 world data have clearly demonstrated the validity of scaling and superscaling properties in these kinematical domains  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> to summarize : by dividing the experimental @xmath0 differential cross sections by an appropriate single - nucleon factor one gets the superscaling function , which embodies the basic information about the nuclear dynamics . at sufficiently high energies </S>",
    "<S> this function depends upon the transferred momentum ( @xmath4 ) and energy ( @xmath5 ) only through a particular combination , the scaling variable @xmath6  @xcite ( first - kind scaling ) and is independent of the particular nucleus selected ( second - kind scaling ) .    </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the superscaling function extracted from data presents an asymmetric shape with a pronounced tail extending into the region of high transferred energies , corresponding to positive values of the scaling variable @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> while this asymmetry is largely absent in most non - relativistic models based on the impulse approximation , the systematic study presented in  @xcite has shown that the correct amount of asymmetry is provided in the relativistic impulse approximation ( ria ) when fsi are described with a relativistic mean field ( rmf ) potential . </S>",
    "<S> recently , a similar asymmetric scaling function has also been obtained within a semi - relativistic ( sr ) approach including fsi through a dirac - equation - based model  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the superscaling function @xmath8 has been investigated in detail using various models based on the impulse approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the results are consistent with the existence of a _ </S>",
    "<S> universal _ scaling function , which means that @xmath8 is basically the same for different types of reactions , such as @xmath0 and @xmath2 , provided that the same kinematical regime is considered . as a consequence , instead of using specific models for the nuclear structure and reaction mechanism </S>",
    "<S> , one can use the _ phenomenological _ susa superscaling function extracted from @xmath0 data to make reliable predictions for neutrino - nucleus cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> this strategy was first pursued in  @xcite for charge - changing ( cc ) @xmath2 processes , and has recently been applied  @xcite to neutral - current ( nc ) neutrino - nucleus scattering reactions . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> predictions were given for differential cross sections and a comparison with various relativistic fsi predictions was also provided for the two @xmath9-channel processes , @xmath0 and @xmath2 .    the differential cross sections and scaling functions were studied at depth in  @xcite , while in this work we focus on integrated cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> we present and discuss results for cc neutrino cross sections , integrated over the muon energy as a function of the muon scattering angle , as well as for cross sections integrated with respect to the scattering angle as a function of the outgoing muon energy . finally , the behavior of the total cross section ( integrated over both the scattering angle and muon energy ) as a function of the incident neutrino energy is also investigated . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the results evaluated within the ria framework with those obtained by using the _ phenomenological _ scaling function . </S>",
    "<S> we also include for reference the results corresponding to the relativistic fermi gas ( rfg ) model .    </S>",
    "<S> studies of integrated cross sections are relevant for the analysis of present and future neutrino oscillation experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the significant differences observed in the differential cross sections when comparing various model predictions  @xcite with the phenomenological scaling function can also have consequences for the integrated cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it is of interest to determine how the large _ asymmetry _ in the scaling function implied by the susa approach reflects on the integrated cross section . a comparison with the different theoretical descriptions , specifically the rmf approach which reproduces the asymmetry of data , may give us important clues on the validity of the diverse models .    </S>",
    "<S> in performing the analysis of integrated cross sections , an important issue refers to some of the kinematical regions accessed experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , small values of muon scattering angle between the incoming neutrino and the outgoing muon , @xmath10 , imply small values of the momentum and energy transferred in the process . </S>",
    "<S> in this situation , a theoretical description of the reaction mechanism based on the impulse approximation is questionable . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , the contribution at these small angles to the global integrated cross section is negligible because of the phase - space factor @xmath11 entering the integral . </S>",
    "<S> our aim here is to estimate the effects introduced in the integrated cross sections by different theoretical models and to compare these with those obtained by using the susa approach , and thus we integrate over the full range of @xmath10 allowed by the kinematics .    </S>",
    "<S> c integrated over the muon scattering angle as a function of the kinetic energy of the emitted muon . </S>",
    "<S> results for rmf ( solid ) , rfg ( dashed ) , susa ( dotted ) , and srws ( dot - dashed ) are compared for three different choices of kinematics . ]    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ cs_tmu ] we present results for the cc @xmath12c@xmath13 cross section integrated over the muon scattering angle as a function of the muon kinetic energy . </S>",
    "<S> predictions corresponding to the relativistic impulse approximation with fsi described with the rmf potential ( solid line ) are compared with the cross sections evaluated by making use of the phenomenological superscaling function @xmath8 ( dotted line ) , labelled susa . </S>",
    "<S> we also show results obtained in the rfg model ( dashed line ) and in the sr approach described in  @xcite using a woods saxon potential ( dot - dashed line ) denoted as srws . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters of the ws potential have been taken from @xcite , but with the depth of the central part of the proton potential adjusted to reproduce the experimental mass difference between @xmath12c and @xmath12n . in the rmf and srws </S>",
    "<S> approaches the experimental energies for the bound neutrons are used , whereas in the susa and rfg approaches we have taken into account the mass difference between the initial and final nuclear systems , in accord with with eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 6 ) in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this cuts out the higher muon kinetic energies and produces a depletion of the cross sections .    </S>",
    "<S> three different values of the incident neutrino energy have been considered : @xmath14 0.5 , 1 and 1.5 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the relativistic plane - wave limit for the final nucleons , i.e. , no fsi considered ( not shown in the figure ) , leads to cross sections which are close to the rfg curves . </S>",
    "<S> results in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ cs_tmu ] show that the inclusion of fsi in susa and rmf gives rise to a significant shift of strength : the cross section increases the rfg result at lower muon energy values , whereas it quenches it at higher energies . </S>",
    "<S> this reduction , similar for both rmf and susa approaches , is about 2025% in the region close to the maximum . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the sr model gives results that are similar to those of the rfg . </S>",
    "<S> note also that the use of real potentials for describing the final nucleon states leads to the resonant structure observed for high @xmath15 ( that is , small energy transfer @xmath5 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> c@xmath13 integrated over the emitted muon energy as a function of the scattering angle @xmath10 for three values of the incident neutrino energy @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> results obtained within the context of the ria and fsi described through the rmf ( solid lines ) and srws ( dot - dashed ) approaches are compared with the rfg model ( dashed ) and with the cross section obtained by using the phenomenological superscaling function extracted from the analysis of @xmath0 world data , denoted by susa ( dotted line ) . ]    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ cs_thetamu ] we present the cross section integrated over the muon kinetic energy as a function of the muon scattering angle . </S>",
    "<S> again we compare results for rmf ( solid line ) , rfg ( dashed ) , susa ( dotted ) and srws ( dot - dashed ) . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of fsi in rmf and susa gives rise to a depletion of the cross section , except for very small angles .    </S>",
    "<S> as we show in the following , this implies a _ smaller _ global integrated cross section , which means that , besides the significant redistribution of strength produced by fsi , a global reduction is also observed when an integral over the muon energy and scattering angle is performed .    from figs .  [ cs_tmu ] and [ cs_thetamu ] </S>",
    "<S> it appears that the susa and rmf approaches yield very similar results , corresponding to a redistribution of strength with respect to the rfg and sr models , in agreement with what was found in  @xcite and @xcite for the double - differential cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> note also that nuclear model effects are more important for lower neutrino energies ( @xmath17 gev ) , in accord with previous work  @xcite , and that the scaling arguments are only valid for high enough values of the transfer momentum @xmath4 , i.e. , for high enough values of the neutrino energy . </S>",
    "<S> hence , some caution must be exercised when using the susa approach for small @xmath16 .     for qe muon neutrino reactions with @xmath12c as a function of the incident neutrino energy . </S>",
    "<S> we present results corresponding to rmf ( squares ) , rfg ( solid line ) , susa ( dashed line ) , rpwia ( dot - dashed line ) , srws ( circles ) and srws - tot ( crosses ) . ]    </S>",
    "<S> finally , nuclear model and fsi effects in the fully integrated cross section are presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ cs_total ] , where the total cross section @xmath18 is plotted as a function of the incident neutrino energy . besides the four models considered in the previous figures we also display the result corresponding to rpwia . </S>",
    "<S> all of the descriptions lead to a similar behavior for the quasielastic cross section , which increases with the neutrino energy up to @xmath19 11.2 gev and then saturates to an almost constant value  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the rpwia and rfg models give very similar results up to @xmath20 0.81 gev , while for higher energies the rfg yields a lower cross section due to the above - mentioned nuclear mass difference , which entails a cut in the lower energy transfers . </S>",
    "<S> the srws model yields results which are close to the rfg prediction . </S>",
    "<S> the results denoted srws - tot include also the contribution of the discrete spectrum of @xmath12n obtained with the ws potential . </S>",
    "<S> this contribution turns out to be very small ( below 2% ) . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the rmf prediction coincides with the susa one up to neutrino energies of about 1.2 gev . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the fsi effects in rmf and susa remain sizeable even at large @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , they tend to stabilize , being of the order of @xmath2115% at neutrino energies @xmath22 gev .    before concluding , </S>",
    "<S> a comment is in order concerning the effect of pauli blocking ( pb ) in the rfg model . </S>",
    "<S> it is well - known that pb , which is obviously accounted for in the rfg model , only affects the low momentum and energy transfer region . </S>",
    "<S> however in the process we are considering here this region is kinematically forbidden due to the mass difference between the initial ( @xmath12c ) and residual ( @xmath12n ) nuclei . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> the effect of pb in the integrated cross sections turns out to be negligible .    </S>",
    "<S> although no direct comparison of our predictions with experiment can be performed , since no data on @xmath12c are yet available in this energy range , the existing experimental data on @xmath23h ( which are , e.g. , summarized in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) are in qualitative agreement with the susa predictions . however , due to the above mentioned relevance of the mass difference bewteen the initial and final nucleus , a simple renormalization of the nucleon number is not sufficient to test our model based on deuteron data .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have evaluated the charged - current quasielastic neutrino - nucleus cross sections integrated over the muon scattering variables ( kinetic energy and scattering angle ) within different relativistic theoretical approaches . </S>",
    "<S> our results can be summarized as follows : ( i ) the effect of nuclear interactions is sizable for all values of the neutrino energy ranging from 0.5 to 2 gev and amounts to a significant redistribution of the strength in the single - differential cross sections and to a lowering by about 1520% of the total cross section with respect to the relativistic fermi gas result . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) at high neutrino energies the differential cross section @xmath24 is strongly peaked at low scattering angles ; similarly @xmath25 displays a pronounced maximum at high muon kinetic energy . as a consequence the total cross section is rather sensitive to the range of integration , which should be carefully taken into account when comparing with experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) finally , the integrated cross section evaluated with the phenomenological superscaling function is very close to the rmf prediction . </S>",
    "<S> this result complements our previous analyses of differential cross sections and scaling functions , and it gives us confidence in the adequacy of descriptions of qe @xmath26 reactions within the ria context when fsi are included via strong relativistic potentials . </S>"
