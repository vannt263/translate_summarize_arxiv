    "due to its simplicity , a single particle in a double - well potential has been a paradigm to demonstrate many fundamental quantum phenomena , in particular , quantum tunneling and its control@xcite . immediately after the experimental creation of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) with dilute alkali atomic gases@xcite",
    ", people realize the new possibility of putting a bec in a double - well potential and using it to mimic this paradigm system to demonstrate experimentally quantum tunneling and other fundamental quantum phenomena .",
    "the subsequent studies show that a bec in a double - well potential has richer physics due to interaction .",
    "for example , it was found that the tunneling of bec between the wells can be suppressed and therefore self - trapped in one of the wells@xcite-@xcite .",
    "this self - trapping phenomenon has now been observed experimentally with a bec@xcite .",
    "more interestingly , the nonlinear two - mode model derived to describe a bec in a double - well potential was found to be able to describe the tunneling between bloch bands for a bec in an optical lattice@xcite . due to interaction , a new quantum phenomenon called nonlinear landau - zener tunneling",
    "was predicted and later observed in experiment@xcite .",
    "it is known that , for a single particle in a double - well potential , one can use an external periodically driving field to control quantum tunneling , either enhancing@xcite-@xcite or suppressing it@xcite-@xcite one then wonders whether this kind of control can be also achieved for a bec in a double - well potential .",
    "there have been several studies in this regard@xcite-@xcite .",
    "these studies indeed find that the periodically driving force can strongly affect the tunneling between two weakly coupled becs and therefore be used to control the tunneling .",
    "recently , we found that such a control of quantum tunneling can also be achieved in an optical waveguide system@xcite and be used to improve the performance of an all - optical switch@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the quasi - energies and floquet states of two weakly coupled becs under periodic driving , which can be realized experimentally with either a double - well potential or an optical lattice@xcite .",
    "quasi - energies and floquet states are two basic concepts and tools in describing and understanding periodically driving systems .",
    "one can use either a mean - field nonlinear two - mode model or a second quantized model to describe such a system . in this paper",
    "we use both models to compute the quasi - energies and floquet states . in the mean - field two - mode model",
    ", we discover that there can be more than two floquet states and quasi - energies in a certain range of parameters that characterize the amplitude and frequency of the modulating force . with these additional floquet states , there appears a triangle in the quasi - energy levels .",
    "this triangular structure in quasi - energies turns out to be crucial to understanding the localization phenomenon that has been found and studied previously@xcite .",
    "our analysis shows that the localization phenomenon can be regarded as a generalization of a well - known phenomenon called coherent destruction of tunneling(cdt ) .",
    "therefore , we call it nonlinear coherent destruction of tunneling(ncdt)@xcite .    in the second quantized model , our computation also reveals a triangular structure in the quasi - energy levels .",
    "interestingly , the quantum triangle is enveloped perfectly by the mean - field triangle , indicating a close connection between these two different approaches . by analyzing the corresponding floquet states",
    ", we find that this quantum triangle of quasi - energies is also connected to the localization phenomenon called ncdt . the close relation between quantum quasi - energies and mean - field quasi - energies",
    "is further explored by a semi - classical method . by using a sommerfeld quantization rule adapted for a time - dependent system , we re -",
    "calculate the quantum quasi - energies by quantizing semiclassically the mean - field model .",
    "the results match very well with the quantum quasi - energies obtained by directly using the second quantized model .    due to the complication brought by the chaos in the region of moderate frequencies , the focus of our paper is on cases of high frequency modulation .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath0 identical bosons , which can occupy only two quantum states . if there is interaction between bosons , the system hamiltonian reads@xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the energy difference between the two quantum states denoted by @xmath3 and @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the coupling constant between the two modes .",
    "the interaction strength is given by c=|_0()|^4d , where we have used a reasonable assumption that the wave functions of the two quantum states are the same except a possible trivial shift of the center and the wave function is normalized @xmath6 .",
    "when the temperature is very low so that we can ignore any thermal effect and at the same time the number of bosons @xmath0 is very large , it is appropriate to make the following coherent substitutes a=/ ,  b= /.",
    "this leads to a mean - field hamiltonian h_mf&=&= ( |a|^2-|b|^2)-(a^*b+ab^ * ) + & & + ( |a|^4+|b|^4 ) .",
    "[ eq : hm ]    the system described above has now been realized with a double - well potential . for the experiment in ref.@xcite ,",
    "there are about 1150 atoms and a simple estimate gives @xmath7s@xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "this system can also be realized experimentally with an optical lattice@xcite .    in our study , we have @xmath10 , that is , the energy difference between the two quantum states is changed periodically . with the double - well potential ,",
    "this can be achieved by shifting periodically the power of lasers that generate the double wells . for an optical lattice , this can be accomplished by shaking along the lattice direction .",
    "we focus our study on the quasi - energies and floquet states of this system as these are two basic concepts and tools in understanding a periodically driving system .",
    "we first consider the mean - field model . from the mean - field hamiltonian ( [ eq : hm ] ) , we can obtain a two - mode gross - pitaevskii equation @xmath11 where we have used the natural unit @xmath12 .",
    "although the parameters @xmath13 , @xmath5 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are of unit of energy , we shall treat them as dimensionless parameters in the following discussion because what is essential is the ratios between these parameters not their absolute values .    like its linear counterpart , a nonlinear periodic time dependent equation admits solutions in the form of floquet states .",
    "for eq.([eq : meanfield ] ) , its floquet state has the following form ( ) = e^-it ( ) , where both @xmath16 and @xmath17 are periodic functions of period of @xmath18 and the constant @xmath19 is the corresponding quasi - energy .",
    "after one period , this solution returns to its original state by picking up an extra phase of @xmath20 . to calculate numerically floquet states and quasi - energies ,",
    "we follow the strategy that was used to compute nonlinear bloch states and the eigen - energies@xcite . in this strategy , we expand the floquet states in fourier series _ 1=_n =- l^la_ne^int ,   _",
    "2=_n =- l^lb_ne^int , where @xmath21 is the cut - off and equal to 10 in our computation . with the substitution of the above fourier series into eq .",
    "( [ eq : meanfield ] ) , one can obtain @xmath22 equalities for the coefficients of each fourier term @xmath23 .",
    "the floquet state and the quasi - energy are found by finding the roots of this set of @xmath22 nonlinear equations .",
    "our method is different from the previous methods used to compute floquet states and quasi - energies@xcite .",
    "we believe that it is more powerful .",
    "for example , it can find the floquet states that correspond to hyperbolic fixed points in poincar section , which can not be found with the previous method@xcite .",
    "our numerical results of quasi - energies are plotted in fig.[fig : meanfieldquasienergies ] .",
    "it is clear from fig.[fig : meanfieldquasienergies ] that , for the linear case , there are two quasi - energies at a given value of @xmath24 with one isolated degeneracy point . for the nonlinear case ,",
    "we notice that there are three quasi - energies within a certain range of @xmath24 with two of them degenerate .",
    "the three quasi - energies form a triangle in the quasi - energy levels as seen in fig.[fig : meanfieldquasienergies](b ) . among the three quasi - energies , two quasi - energy levels are similar to their linear counterparts with one isolated degenerate point while the third quasi - energy level has no linear counterpart . moreover ,",
    "the third quasi - energy is degenerate and corresponds to two different floquet states ; this is indicated by marking the same point in fig.[fig : meanfieldquasienergies](b ) with two symbols @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "note two things : ( 1 ) there is no threshold value of @xmath13 for the triangle to appear ; ( 2 ) the right corner of triangle is open for relatively larger nonlinear parameter @xmath13 .     at ( a)@xmath27 ; ( b)@xmath28 ; ( c)@xmath29 .",
    "solid lines are numerical results and circles are the approximate analytical results for high frequencies with eqs.([highfrequency1],[highfrequency2 ] ) .",

    "@xmath30.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    despite the obvious similarity between the nonlinear floquet states and the linear ones , there are a couple of conceptual differences .",
    "( 1 ) a periodically driven @xmath31-level linear system possesses precisely @xmath31 floquet states whereas the number of nonlinear floquet states of @xmath31-mode system can be bigger than @xmath31 as we have witnessed above .",
    "( 2 ) in linear case , all wave functions can be decomposed into a superposition of floquet states and , therefore , the dynamics of the system is dictated by floquet states . in the nonlinear case , the superposition principle breaks down , the dynamics of the system can no longer be completely determined by floquet states .",
    "the triangular structure of the quasi - energy is very similar to the energy loop discovered within the context of nonlinear landau - zener tunneling@xcite .",
    "in fact , they are mathematically related .",
    "for high frequencies , @xmath32 , we take advantage of the transformation a = a ,   b = b^. [ trans ] after averaging out the high frequency terms@xcite , we obtain a non - driving nonlinear model , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the zeroth - order bessel function .",
    "it is clear from the transformation in eq.([trans ] ) that the eigenstates of the above non - driving nonlinear equations correspond to the floquet states of eq.([eq : meanfield ] ) .",
    "we have computed the eigenstates of eqs.([highfrequency1],[highfrequency2 ] ) and the corresponding eigenenergies , which are plotted as circles in fig.[fig : meanfieldquasienergies ] .",
    "the consistency with our previous numerical results is obvious .",
    "as is known in ref.@xcite , the above nonlinear model admits additional eigenstates when @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , this can be regarded as the condition for the extra floquet states to appear for the driving nonlinear model eq.[eq : meanfield ] at high frequencies .",
    "since the bessel function @xmath36 can be zero , there is no threshold value of @xmath13 for the triangle to appear in the quasi - energy band .",
    "the nonlinear floquet states are also examined thoroughly .",
    "we find that some of them are localized , which is very different from the linear floquet states that are always unlocalized .",
    "to describe localization , we introduce a new variable , @xmath37 , which measures the population difference between the two modes .",
    "one floquet state is localized if the average of @xmath38 over one period , p_t=_0^tdtp(t ) , [ eq : local ] is nonzero ; it is unlocalized if @xmath39 . in fig.[fig : floquetstate ] , the population difference @xmath38 is plotted as a function of time for three stable nonlinear floquet states marked as @xmath40 in fig.[fig : meanfieldquasienergies](b ) .",
    "evidently , one of these states is unlocalized since @xmath38 oscillates around zero . however , two other states are localized with @xmath38 oscillating around a non - zero value .",
    "the localization means that the bec described by such floquet states tends to stay in one mode and reluctant to tunnel to the other mode .",
    "therefore , localization can be understood as a suppression of tunneling .",
    "our study shows that on one hand , all the localized floquet states correspond to the highest quasi - energies on the triangle and on the other hand , all floquet states in the linear case and all the floquet states not related to the quasi - energy triangle are not localized .",
    "this implies that the triangle in fig.[fig : meanfieldquasienergies ] is related to localization or suppression of tunneling .",
    "this is indeed the case as we have shown in ref.@xcite .",
    "we shall not repeat what we have done in ref.@xcite ; we shall look into this connection from a different angle .",
    "for three stable nonlinear floquet states at @xmath41 , for an interval of four periods of the driving force(solid lines ) .",
    "the floquet states correspond to the quasi - energies in fig.[fig : meanfieldquasienergies](b ) marked as @xmath40 with triangles .",
    "the squares are for floquet states in the highest two quantum quasi - energy levels with @xmath42.,width=302 ]    in the mean - field model ( [ eq : meanfield ] ) , the norm @xmath43 is conserved and the overall phase is not essential to the dynamics .",
    "therefore , we can reduce the complex dynamical variables @xmath44 , @xmath45 to a pair of real variable , @xmath37 and the relative phase @xmath46 . in terms of @xmath38 and @xmath47 ,",
    "the mean - field hamiltonian ( [ eq : hm ] ) becomes @xmath48 as @xmath38 and @xmath47 are canonically conjugate variables of the above classical hamiltonian system , one can derive a set of equations of motion . from the equations of motion , one can plot the poincar section of this system .",
    "two poincar sections are illustrated in fig.[fig : phase ] for two sets of parameters .",
    "as the overall phase is removed , the floquet states correspond to the fixed points in poincar section .",
    "the parameters for fig.[fig : phase](a ) are outside the triangle range . in this figure",

    "one is hyperbolic and unstable whereas the other two are not only stable but localized .",
    "moreover , all the orbits surrounding these two stable fixed points at @xmath52 are localized solutions .",
    "these again show that the triangle structure in quasi - energies are related to localization or suppression of tunneling .    ) .",

    "first , the degeneracy point in fig.[fig : meanfieldquasienergies](a ) is related to a localization phenomenon called coherent destruction of tunneling ( cdt ) and the triangle can be seen as the result of enlargement of the degenerate point by nonlinearity .",
    "second , as we have seen in fig.[fig : phase ] , the localization phenomenon is intimately related to the nonlinear floquet states and we know that cdt is related to linear floquet states . the localization phenomenon which we call ncdt has been called in literature self - trapping or ,",
    "more precisely , periodically modulated self - trapping@xcite .",

    "is that all the quasi - energies in the triangle area is doubly degenerate and this degeneracy immediately breaks up outside the triangle .",
    "the feature is related the localization phenomenon ncdt as we shall discuss next .",

    "our primary purpose here is to compare them to the mean - field results and explore their relations , which has not been studied so far .",
    "in the previous section , we have demonstrated by direct numerical computation how the quantum floquet states and quasi - energies are connected to their mean - field counterparts .",
    "this relation can be further explored with a semiclassical method as the mean - field model ( [ eq : hm ] ) can be regarded as the classical limit of the second quantized model ( [ eq : hqfock ] ) in the limit of @xmath74@xcite .",

    "<S> we investigate the quasi - energies and floquet states of two weakly coupled bose - einstein condensates driven by a periodic force . </S>",
    "<S> the quasi - energies and floquet states of this system are computed within two different theoretical frameworks : the mean - field model and the second - quantized model . </S>",
    "<S> the mean - field approach reveals a triangular structure in the quasi - energy band . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis of the corresponding floquet states shows that this triangle signals the onset of a localization phenomenon , which can be regarded as a generalization of the well - known phenomenon called coherent destruction of tunneling . with the second quantized model , </S>",
    "<S> we find also a triangular structure in the quantum quasi - energy band , which is enveloped by the mean - field triangle . </S>",
    "<S> the close relation between these two sets of quasi - energies is further explored by a semi - classical method . with a sommerfeld rule generalized to time - dependent systems , </S>",
    "<S> the quantum quasi - energies are computed by quantizing semiclassically the mean - field model and they are found to agree very well with the results obtained directly with the second - quantized model . </S>"
