    "the velocity function , which is defined as the abundance of galaxies with a given circular velocity , is one of fundamental statistical properties of galaxies .",
    "it is a kin of the much more well known and studied statistics : the luminosity function - the abundance of galaxies with a given luminosity .",
    "the luminosity function is easier to measure , and indeed there are numerous estimates of the luminosity function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "from the theoretical point of view there are substantial differences between luminosity and velocity functions .",
    "it is much more difficult to make theoretical predictions for the luminosities .",
    "galaxy luminosity and stellar mass are the results of a complicated history of star formation of a galaxy .",
    "it depends on accretion and merging history and also on many other processes , which operate when a galaxy evolves  the stellar winds , supernovae explosions , galactic fountains  to name a few .",
    "this makes the luminosity and stellar mass very valuable tools to study the evolution of the universe , but it makes them very difficult to predict .    testing the theoretical predictions of the abundance of galaxies can done using the semi - analytical models ( sams ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , sams use many assumptions and parameters , which make theoretical predictions somewhat uncertain .",
    "the main source of the uncertainty is due to the lack of detailed understanding of how galaxies form and evolve in the cosmological framework . another popular way of relating dark matter halos with galaxies are the halo abundance matching ( ham ) @xcite and the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) @xcite .",
    "these methods are often used to predict galaxy clustering at different redshifts .",
    "however , they _ assume _ galaxy luminosity or stellar mass functions , and thus can not be used to test theory when it comes to predictions of abundances of galaxies .",
    "because the circular velocity measures the mass in the inner region of a dark matter halo ( e.g. , about @xmath12 for a milky - way mass halo ) where the observed galaxy is situated , and because the circular velocity does not depend on the complicated history of star formation , the velocity function of galaxies can be predicted much more accurately than the luminosity function .",
    "this makes the circular velocity function a useful tool for testing the theory @xcite .",
    "the abundance of satellites of the local group is an example of the power of the velocity function as a test for cosmological predictions @xcite .",
    "comparison of the predicted abundance of subhalos with given circular velocity in cosmological @xmath13-body simulations with the observed number of satellites clearly indicate a large disparity between the theory and observations .",
    "there are explanations for the disagreement , which include a variety of different effects , including photoheating during the reionization epoch @xcite and stellar feedback @xcite .",
    "modifications of the cosmological model are also used to address the problem .",
    "suppression of the spectrum of fluctuations on small scales in models of the warm dark matter results in substantial reduction of predicted small halos , which is the reason why wdm models are often used as explanation for the overabundance of the subhalos @xcite .",
    "see , however , @xcite .",
    "velocity function of galaxies addresses some of the same key issues as the abundance of satellites in the local group ( e.g. , are there too many dwarf halos predicted by the   model ) .",
    "however , in many respects these are a different statistics .",
    "velocity function measures the abundance of all galaxies  not only the satellites .",
    "it may seem couter - intuitive , but for a given cut of the circular velocity , most of the objects are `` parents '' : galaxies or dm halos in simulations that do not belong to a larger galaxy or halo @xcite .",
    "another difference is the fraction of different morphological types .",
    "most of dwarf galaxies in the local group are dwarf spheroidal galaxies , whereas most of the galaxies in the local volume are star - forming dwarf irregular galaxies .",
    "the velocity function is relatively easy to predict theoretically @xcite , but much more difficult to measure in observations .",
    "so far there were some attempts to produce observational estimates using sdss data @xcite , hipass @xcite and alfalfa @xcite . in spite of the progress in the measurements , there are some disagreements . for example , sdss @xcite and hipass @xcite data indicate that the vf becomes constant at velocities @xmath14 , while @xcite find that vf keeps increasing even at very small velocities @xmath15 with the slope @xmath16 .",
    "galaxies in both the hipass and the alfalfa are selected by hi   fluxes , which means that they miss early - type galaxies .",
    "while predicting circular velocity is easier than that of the stellar mass or luminosity , it still requires some effort and needs careful estimates and corrections due to different effects .",
    "there are different steps toward accurate predictions of the velocity function .",
    "the first step is large cosmological n - body simulations with high mass and force resolution .",
    "resolution is an important factor .",
    "because the maximum of the circular velocity is reached at a small fraction the virial radius , the resolution of simulations needed for accurate estimates of the velocity function is typically 5 - 10 times better than that needed for the halo mass function @xcite .",
    "only recently simulations with this resolution and large volume became available providing us with needed estimates .",
    "in addition to high - quality simulations one needs to make corrections due to baryons : gas and stars in central regions of galaxies make the circular velocity larger ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these corrections are small for galaxies with circular velocities below @xmath17 , which are dark matter dominated even in central @xmath18 regions . for larger galaxies",
    "the corrections can be as large as 20 - 50% .",

    "however , at @xmath178 the disagreement with the theory is a factor of 20 . in order to reconcile observations with the @xmath92 model ,",
    "most of the dwarfs must have been missed in the local volume sample : an unlikely proposition considering the convergence of results on the luminosity function at @xmath66 .",
    "the main problem is with larger galaxies in the range of velocities @xmath179 .",
    "these galaxies are bright , @xmath180 , and it is unrealistic to assume that the local volume sample missed 1000 of them .",
    "the only remote possibility is that a large fraction of the galaxies are low surface brightness dwarf spheroidal galaxies with surface brightness well below 25 mag per square arcsecond .",
    "so far , none of these bright and extra low surface brightness galaxies have been found .    _",
    "theory : _ it is difficult to resolve the overabundance of field galaxies because some of the problematic galaxies are relatively large with @xmath172 and @xmath181 .",
    "for example , photoheating during reionization hardly can affect these objects . another possible way out",
    "is not to have the star formation in most of these galaxies .",

    "however , those massive dark hi  clouds have not been found .",
    "mass of the clouds should be @xmath182 , if they follow the baryonic tully - fisher relation",
    ".    one may think that flattening of the dark matter cusp in dwarf galaxies in numerous episods of contraction and expansion due to centrally concentrated bursts of star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may solve the problem with the abundance of field dwarfs .",
    "indeed , large variations in the gravitational potential of a forming dwarf galaxy are capable of reducing the dark matter density in the central galaxy region , which in turn reduces the circular velocity @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this reduction in the central dark matter density does not automatically resolve the issue .",
    "the dark matter , which was heated and pushed from the cusp , does not leave the galaxy .",
    "it just moves away from the central cusp and settles at somewhat larger radius @xcite . within this radius",
    "the total mass does not change , and thus the circular velocity does not change either .",
    "the question is how large is the radius and how does it compare to the radius that defines the observed hi  line width .",
    "rotation curves in dwarf galaxies are rising even at large radii .",
    "thus , it is the outskirts of galaxies that define the observed hi  line width ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the problem is that the neutral hydrogen in galaxies extends to very large radii : substantially larger than the optical radius , where thrashing and heating of the dark matter happens .",
    "for example , data in figure  [ fig : gasextent ] indicates that gas in galaxies with rotational velocity @xmath183 extends to 24  kpc .",
    "( see also figure  3 in @xcite and figures  5 and b.1 in @xcite for simular results ) .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations show that the size of the core in such galaxies should be @xmath184 @xcite , which is not enough to substantially reduce hi  line width at @xmath185 .",
    "the problem is even worse for smaller galaxies with rotational velocity @xmath186 and virial mass @xmath187 .",
    "current numerical simulations of these galaxies @xcite indicate that there is not enough energy in the stellar feedback to flatten dark matter cores of these dwarfs .",
    "it is possible that current simulations may not implemented all effects of the stellar feedback , and that better models will show larger decline in the density .",
    "another possible solution for the overabundance problem is the possibility that in reality there are many missed very low surface brightness galaxies with just enough star formation to keep the gas ionized .",
    "so , the galaxies are not detected in both hi   and optical observations .",
    "after our paper was submitted for publication , @xcite came to similar conclusions the regarding the extend of the hi gas in dwarf galaxies : neutral gas extends far enough to probe the part of the circular velocity curve that defines value of @xmath51 .",
    "they also confirm our findings on the disagreement between observations and theory on the abundance of galaxies with given circular velocities .",
    "the abundance of galaxies as a function of their circular velocity @xmath96 is a fundamental statistics , which provides a sensitive probe for theoretical predictions @xcite . because it is difficult to measure the velocity function , only recently observations became capable of producing reasonably converging estimates of @xmath96 for different samples @xcite .",
    "abundance of galaxies with given circular velocity @xmath50 or line - width @xmath31 in the local volume ( distances less than 10  mpc ) provide a valuable information that can be difficult to obtain using other samples @xcite because in the local volume we observe small galaxies , and the sample has galaxies of all morphological types .",
